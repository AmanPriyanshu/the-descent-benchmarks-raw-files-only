[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Everyone, welcome to the new episode of Critical Role. This evening, we luckily have Ashley Johnson back in as her character Pike. Unfortunately, Laura Bailey will be gone for most of the game, possibly, she might come in, 'cause she's busy recording a show with Wil Wheaton. It's gonna be a great show, but we'll miss her, until she shows up. However, we shall see what the next chapter has in store in just a moment. In the meantime, let's go ahead and get you situated with the character backgrounds.
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size. This barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (giggles), shiny things. But also ale. In his early years, armed with his two handed gray axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned, and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches. Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder clap) Under that unintimidating, petite frame is a vicious beast, waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants. Literally. (giggles) Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation, and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. Anyways. It wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities, and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped, and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stilben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise, and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest, and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river, and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well gird your loins ladies because he has his eyes on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troop, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter a distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts, and makes the females swoon. (sputtering)
Orion: Greetings, and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Tirex, located in the heart of Draconia. Born from a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the sorcerer's right, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges in the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps, of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learn of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse, and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands, in that respect. But it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that! (sputtering) I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy go lucky, and, well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax’ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capitol of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capitol didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night, and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journey back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax’ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (drawing blades) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax’ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance. And after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of a thief. While Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt, and to track, to spy, and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen trinket-- to fight along side her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable. And gives expert massages.
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this Barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (giggles), shiny things. But also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the wood--
Matt: Welcome back. Unfortunately, we don't have Pike's video ready yet. I'm working on it.
Ashley: My bad.
Matt: This week got away from me, and Ashley got it to me a little late, but we'll have it up next week, don't worry. However we are happy to have Ashley with us. (all cheer) She's come down from her BAFTA cloud. (all laugh) Which is amazing, congratulations again.
Ashley: Thank you guys.
Matt: So yeah, as a heads up too, if you wanna do any quick announcements real fast, I think you had an announcement you wanted to make.
Ashley: It's my mom's birthday today. (all cheer)
Matt: Happy birthday Ashley's mom, yay!
Ashley: Her name's Nancy.
Liam: Hi Nancy.
Travis: Happy birthday, Nancy. Totally watching this right now.
Marisha: Is she watching?
Ashley: She probably is. (all laugh)
Matt: Well, hello! Also for those who are Hearthstone players, the new Black Hawk Mountain Expansion came out today, in which I voice Nefarian and Ragnaros. (all cheer) My vanilla-WoW-playing self from back in the day is nerding out over that, so enjoy that. Anyone have anything else they wanna announce or talk about? Are we good to start?
Sam: Hi, mom!
Marisha: Hi, mom.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: I don't think my mom knows what the internet is.
Orion: Related, I leveled my undead holy priest to 64 last night, on Warcraft.
Zac: We're just about a thousand happy--
Matt: Congrats. Way to go, level 64. So you're just barely into burning crusade, good man. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I got one too. My brother who also works in video games gave a talk at GVC this year, and it just went online, and not now but later you should watch Alex Jaffe's talk on metagame balancing. It's really really fun, it's fabulous, and you learn a lot.
Matt: There you go, Alex Jaffe, look it up.
Marisha: Alex is brilliant.
Matt: All right guys, so, getting to the game at hand. So little overview for the story, the party has been sent to the city of Kraghammer, through a friend of theirs named Arcanist Allura Vysoren. A good friend of hers and a folk hero throughout the land known as Lady Kima of Vord, who's the halfling paladin of Bahamut, has gone missing. She went on a vision quest as part of a pilgrimage she's been on for the past year, and sensed a dark evil brewing far beneath the city of Kraghammer. Disappeared into the city and hasn't been seen for weeks. So Arcanist Allura asked the party, hired them essentially, to go and see her whereabouts. Upon getting to Kraghammer, they interacted with some of the local characters, eventually found theirself talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who owns the mines at the very bottom of Kraghammer proper. After a brief encounter with a mutated abomination of a Naga creature, they were then hired by lord Nostoc to go into the mines, find whatever's creating these abominations, destroy whatever is the source of them, and he will pay well and also pay for each creature head that is brought to him individually. After getting into the mines, a few battles ensue with some of the local denizens, couple of the umber hulks, that were turned into snails, and other interesting circumstances. The party then found what looked to be an entirely abandoned goblin city, and a series of goblinoid corpses, many of which had bored holes in their skull in various states of decay. They found a long bridge across an open chasm. Upon traversing it, Scanlan went invisible, and found what looked like a duergar war camp, which are like ashy-skinned, evil dwarves that live deep underground. Watched a dwarf get executed by what appeared to be some sort of strange alienoid creature, that was revealed to be an illithid, or a mind flayer. A being that is psychic and consumes brains.
Ashley: Brains!
Matt: Upon returning, the party had a plan to lead them off of a illusionary cliff, that went pretty well. Ended up taking out a significant portion of the charging army at the time. Vax here, however, got stunned on the way across by the one mind flayer, nearly fell, however was saved by Tiberius at the last moment. Nearly lost their magic carpet, but it was retrieved.
Ashley: Wait, you still have the magic carpet, right?
Matt: Yeah, it got recovered. Barely.
Marisha: We got it back, it's okay.
Travis: Not thanks to some.
Matt: (laughs) After brief discussion, Keyleth and Vex decided they didn't want to listen to anyone's bullshit, and hijacked magic carpet, flew down into the chasm below, and discovered behind one of the underground waterfalls some sort of a mind flayer who was cast out from the society, covered in rags, kind of a twisted physical form, and after a very tense discussion seemed to befriend it under the guise of mutually agreed retribution against those that are oppressive to this whole chasm area.
Marisha: Clarence.
Liam: Clarota.
Sam: Clarota.
Matt: Clarota. I don't think he'll take kindly to Clarence. However, this is where we left off the previous game.
Ashley: So nervous.
Matt: As you guys have gathered up, and you've finished your luxurious song to try and ease his torn form, he finishes tapping his toe in spite of himself. Looks about the rest of the group and says, once again, not vocally, but speaking directly into your mind, through a horrifying whispered voice that you cannot even close your ears to get rid of, "I think it's best we rest out of sight." He points across the chasm, to the war camp that is looming across the way. He begins to dart off towards the abandoned goblinoid village.
Orion: I guess we should follow him, then.
Sam: Yes, that's wise.
Taliesin: I think that's a great idea.
Sam: We follow.
Taliesin: No, nothing can be there.
Matt: As you guys make your way in toward the goblinoid village, you can see Clarota who is genuinely hovering about a foot off the ground, and kind of just coasting around in a very creepy way. Finds one tent, opens up and looks inside, "Here, here we can talk." Darts inside.
Travis: We follow.
Sam: We do follow, yes.
Matt: As you're following--
Travis: Oh crap.
Sam: Oh God, we're dead.
Travis: Why? Why would he touch his dice? We're gonna die!
Matt: As you're following towards the center of this town, you, see in the distance, a small light moving, back from the direction where you first saw that duergar camp, where Grog was assaulted.
Travis: I don't recall that.
Liam: Look back the way we came, there's some sort of light up ahead.
Orion: That can't be good.
Liam: Stay with Clarota, I'm gonna go take a look, Scanlan, come on.
Sam: I'm coming with.
Matt: Both of you guys roll stealth.
Travis: I'll stay outside the tent if somebody wants to ask him how to get a Magneto helmet like his. (all laugh) 'Cause I'm gonna need that.
Orion: I'll talk to him.
Sam: It's just a roll? Not great. Nine!
Liam: 29.
Taliesin: That's a number.
Matt: So, as you officially vanish into the ether and surrounding darkness, Scanlan, who still has that song stuck in his head from earlier, his slow jam is just... (laughs) Abstractedly humming to himself without realizing, and calling a little bit of attention, at which point you began to hear some footsteps in the distance that come to an immediate halt.
Liam: Grab Scanlan, put my hand over his mouth, and say, Quiet, man, what's wrong with you?
Sam: It's a nervous habit! I'm sorry! (all laugh)
Liam: With great power comes great responsibility, shut up!
Sam: It's a gift I have to share with the world!
Liam: Later, later. Save it for the mind flayer. So with him tucked under my arm like a football, I start to creep further. And try to make out-- if there's light from the lantern, I can see in dim light, thanks to daddy's blood, so. I'm gonna try to figure out what it is exactly that I'm seeing.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: I also have low light vision.
Matt: You can make perception check with disadvantage, because you're under his arm.
Liam: Perception check? Oh.
Sam: Nope.
Liam: Do I have any advantage on that?
Matt: No.
Liam: 11.
Matt: All right. Actually, directly looking in the direction of that duergar camp earlier, you can see behind a pillar that's blocking your view, it's obstructing your view of the actual camp proper, you can see some movement in the light. You hear some shuffling, it sounds like plate. You hear a voice just kind of muttering to itself. A familiar, female gnomish voice.
Liam: Pike?
Ashley: Hey guys! (all laugh)
Ashley: It's me, Pike!
Liam: Jeez, where have you been?
Ashley: Oh man, I've had quite a time. I've missed you guys terribly. A lot has happened. I'm sure for you guys as well.
Sam: Not so much.
Orion: I say into my thing, "Scanlan, what the hell's going on?"
Sam: Don't worry, it's a friend, we'll bring her back soon.
Orion: Okay, well, there's a mind flayer here.
Sam: Keep him busy. He likes slow jams.
Orion: Right, right.
Matt: As you guys take a look at Pike, you notice she's fully armored, but dirty, she's got sweat across her face, looks like she may have had a couple scuffles on the way through here.
Ashley: I did.
Matt: She's got a wild look to her eyes.
Sam: Oh my God.
Matt: Genuinely relieved to see you. Pike, you've managed to come down here through the front of the mines, which for the most part have been clear. You follow what details you can after asking around and discovering that the rest of your party had ventured below without you. You've followed the tracks best you can, and are glad that you at least chose the right path and ran into them before you ran into something far more dangerous. What you were inspecting was this campsite that appeared to have been abandoned. What caught your eye was against the stone wall right above the ring of stones that form the fire itself, there is a giant symbol carved into the stone that is a protective sigil of Bahamut, the platinum dragon, which is a religious symbol of protection, used in different divine rituals.
Liam: We were looking at that, we couldn't make heads or tails of it. You ever seen that before?
Ashley: No. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and make a religion check.
Liam: Are you sure? Think about it, just for a moment longer.
Ashley: Well give me, actually, let me rethink on this. I think maybe--
Marisha: So wait, are we all reunited?
Liam: Oh, it's a natural 20!
Marisha: Oh, welcome back Pike!
Travis: The first roll.
Marisha: Are we all reunited?
Liam: You just forgot.
Ashley: I just-- you know what? Actually, now that I'm thinking about it. (all laugh)
Matt: You clutch your holy symbol instinctually as you reach up and run your fingers along the stonework, tracing the carving across the stone. As you do, your eyes close, and you feel the warmth of Sarenrae's presence fill your mind for a second, and for a split moment, you can see a well-armored, very driven, female halfling with hair pulled back into tight brown braids, a dark green cloak thrown over one shoulder, who's currently carving that symbol into the stone. You're seeing Lady Kima of Vord, the one who left this symbol, to protect her campsite as she made up camp here. You don't know how long ago this transpired, but this was definitely left by her in this tunnel.
Liam: What is it?
Ashley: It was left by a woman.
Sam: Lady Kima, the one we're trying to find?
Ashley: Yes, Lady Kima.
Liam: How did you know that?
Sam: Me and Pike are like--
Travis: Oh, Jesus.
Sam: It's so great to see you, you look fantastic by the way.
Ashley: I don't feel fantastic.
Sam: Bring it in, bring it in, give me a hug. Ooh, you smell a little. I like it though. Somehow it works on you.
Liam: We're in a very complicated situation, a lot has happened to us. We found sort of a war camp down here, and there is sort of a being, I don't know what to call it. He's got a little of this going on, and he speaks and lashes out through his mind. We fought a huge force down here, and then we ended up falling into a cavern, and then Keyleth and my sister found another one, what are they called? They're called-- illithids.
Sam: Yes, yes. And we found a rogue one, and we may team up with him-- or her?-- to go back and get revenge and maybe kick some ass in the camp.
Liam: This just happened. He seems extremely dangerous, however, the forces we faced in the other illithid seem maybe worse. So that's where we're at.
Sam: So welcome back. Great, sounds like a fun time.
Sam: Let's rejoin our friends, shall we?
Ashley: Let's go kick some ass.
Sam: So we trot back over to the dead goblin village.
Matt: All right, you make your way back to the tent that was originally scouted out. The rest of the party's there waiting as Clarota is awkwardly sitting in the far end, just looking out as all of you slowly approach and enter the tent. Not speaking, just reactionary, and keeping a watch on all of you.
Orion: I turn to Clarota, I'm like, "Ooh, that's our friend, Pike. She's a good ally. Hello, Pike!"
Ashley: Hello everybody.
All: (gasp) Pike!
Orion: Sometimes we hug as allies, Clarota.
Marisha: Where have you been? ASHLEY Well, I had quite a time. When we were up on the tower, I noticed something, and I felt... I had to leave, because I started to have a vision.
Orion: Oh, those are fun.
Ashley: I feel like I should talk to you guys about this later, just because--
Sam: It's personal?
Ashley: What is your name? I'm so sorry. I'm Pike, it's very nice to meet you.
Matt: You get a better look as you approach this entity. You see what looks like a very tall, thin, gaunt-looking humanoid with a hood over the head as you approach. You get a better look at the facial features. Smooth, kind of dull, bluish-purple skin. These sunken, creepy, yellowish green eyes, and instead of where a mouth or nose would be, you see four slightly twitching tentacles. Barely obscuring what looks like a round lamprey-like toothed maw.
Liam: Pike, this is Clarota. We've just met.
Ashley: Can I shake his hand?
Matt: Do you wanna reach your hand out?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: There is no physical response, the hand is not extended, but you hear, in the middle of your mind, at full volume, a creepy whispered voice go, "Are you to be one of our allies as well?"
Ashley: Yes. Of course.
Matt: "Very well, she may stay."
Orion: Thank you very much, Clarota.
Ashley: I take my hand and scratch the back of my head. (all laugh)
Marisha: I take Pike and I kind of pull her out of the tent really quick, and I'm like--
Sam: Girl talk.
Marisha: Okay he's like a mind flayer, and we found him in a hole under a waterfall, but he's cool, but he wants vengeance.
Ashley: Is that-- the thing is covering, so he can't be--
Marisha: He's like outcast, yeah. But he's gonna help us fight all of his tribe who hates us.
Liam: Clarota.
Ashley: Do we know for sure he's helping us?
Orion: Yes.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: Can you help us understand your kind? Your history? How you've come to be here and who this individual is that is fucking with your shit? (all laugh)
Matt: Proverbial statement, I like that. At which point Clarota's eyes narrow, and you can feel just the general mood and energy of the inside of the tent grows dark. It grows mildly tense. Suddenly you feel this presence, a voice once again, fill your mind as Clarota says, "Seven years since I discovered my curse. My form was struck with the brand of the Arcane. And these foul arts proved difficult to conceal. My brethren could sense my impurity, my deviation, and cast me out. I was severed from the Elder Brain. And chased on threat of death, should I return. I wandered these tunnels in squalor, feeding on what paltry filth I could ensnare, and fleeing from the ones I could not face alone. In my wandering, I discovered a duergar stronghold, with a magma pool, and it proved to be a decent source of sustenance for some time. Paying off the occasional straggler. Suddenly a great battle took place. It appeared something had sieged the stronghold. Reading the surface thoughts of the deep dwarves I encountered in the following weeks, I found a shift of power. Whatever had taken this hold had now demanded fealty of them. And they accepted when faced with annihilation. This entity that took the duergar by force, they called K'varn. I caught no sight of it. But the fear I could sense, from within these doors were so primal, so great, that I knew to keep a distance to be safe. But four months ago one of my estranged people, was captured by these ash-skins, and brought within the obsidian walls, for what I assumed was interrogation. Long after, the bulk of the Duergar people marched in packs through the long, deep tunnels that led to my people's colony and attacked. Strangely, before much bloodshed could occur, which I only assume was the next step in this onslaught, the fighting stopped. And the colony allowed the ash skins to waltz directly into the temple, unharmed, unchallenged, where our Elder Brain resides. It wasn't until after I discovered whoever this K'varn is, they themselves infiltrated the temple, and somehow took the Elder Brain under their own control. I watched as my people had their will robbed of them. And they took the will of all the others that lived and breathed in these tunnels. Now, a terrible army is forged of both factions. And they walk under the banner of this K'varn. Since this, I've fled back to the higher tunnels, and scrounged for materials so I could shield myself from the iron grip influence of the now enslaved Elder Brain. It took me weeks. But I'm confident I'm safe from its influence. For now."
Taliesin: Is that the thing that you wear upon your head?
Matt: As it pulls the hood back, you see once again this kind of haphazard, metallic cluster of patches of metal, and iron, this dull kind of blue metallish glow, that you can only now see once he's sitting in near pitch darkness. As he reaches up and runs his finger along it, "Yes. This I feel can protect me. But I think... I think there is a way to change the tides of this circumstance, I feel that if I could somehow free my people from the influence of K'varn, release its hold on the hive mind, my people would allow me to rejoin the colony. To be one again with my family. My brethren."
Liam: I have a few questions. Is that all right?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: You and your brethren, without this, do you think as one?
Matt: "We think as individuals, but the hive mind connects us all. The hive mind gives us knowledge, history, direction. It is the source of our family."
Liam: So, one individual of your family sees something, the entire hive sees the same, is that correct?
Matt: "Yes."
Orion: Oh dear, that's no good. (all laugh)
Liam: And you mentioned the Arcane being a stigma upon you?
Matt: At which point it turns its gaze away, and slinks down into its form slightly.
Liam: What do your brethren put their faith in, if not the Arcane?
Matt: "They put their faith in the arts of the mind. Both understanding, manipulating, controlling, and devouring."
Orion: Clarota, we've already allied ourselves with you, as we've already agreed.
Matt: "You'll help me free my people? To be family again, to belong."
Orion: As we said, yes. But the thing you wear on your head, it would make us all the more equipped to take on this task. It's against such powerful mind creatures, such as yourself, I know my way around a couple Arcane things, but nothing of the mind control sorts. If someone like me were to be influenced, it would be very bad for our group. Even yourself, perhaps. It would do well to at least maybe show us how you built it, and-- You get what I'm getting at, right?
Travis: I would like a steel beanie as well.
Ashley: Basically, where do we get one of those?
Matt: "It would take weeks to build another."
Travis: Weeks?
Taliesin: I would like to take a look into it if possible, and see if it makes sense. I am a builder.
Marisha: Maybe we can figure out something a little bit more jerryrigged.
Taliesin: If we were all hidden, we would have a distinct advantage.
Travis: I have a very large bronze pot in the bag of holding. Could I wear that on me noggin?
Taliesin: If you like.
Matt: It gives you a look in response and says, "This protects me from the influence of the hive mind, my preexisting connection."
Taliesin: Could we be hidden from them? Would there be a way to cloak ourselves from their understanding?
Matt: "Stay hidden from the others. Their sight is the mind's sight. The Elder Brain is a collection of the once living mind flayers of my people."
Liam: I have one more question, and we have allied ourselves to you, that's true. But I'm curious to know, hopefully our goals intertwine, and we want the same thing. But once that is achieved, and it will be, what happens then for the Illithid? Do you return to your home below? Do your people harbor any ambition to move upward into Kraghammer?
Matt: It looks to the side and says, "Our ambition is to pursue the continuation of our knowledge-seeking. We have no interest in the surface. We only wish to spread our dominion here below. Expand our great city of Yug'Voril."
Liam: I'm sorry, what was that name?
Matt: "Yug'Voril."
Orion: Sounds like a lovely town, Yug'Voril.
Matt: "It's beautiful."
Taliesin: I feel that we could come to an arrangement.
Liam: I do as well.
Taliesin: We would require of you, at the very least, safe passage once we have helped you reunite with your people, for ourselves, and for a friend of ours who's lost in the darkness, who we are here to retrieve.
Matt: "For this deed, of freeing my people from this insidious presence that is K'varn..."
Taliesin: Freeing all of our people.
Matt: "I believe this could be arranged."
Liam: Scanlan, does he speak true?
Sam: Uh. Let's find out. (all laugh)
Sam: I'm gonna just see if I can detect any lies.
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check.
Sam: What am I adding to this?
Liam: Insight.
Sam: Oh. 13. I'm not an insight person.
Ashley: Oh, can I--
Travis: (scoffs)
Liam: 20 over here!
Taliesin: What are you doing?
Travis: She's rolled twice.
Ashley: Assisting, assisting. (all laugh)
Taliesin: All of your 20's, running out.
Matt: It's too late for the assist, unfortunately, 'cause it's already rolled.
Liam: But can she suss him out?
Matt: Best you can tell, those who are looking into it, he seems to be speaking from a point of desperation, and intent, as he has no other option. He is genuinely-- You can see it in the way he talks, and the way he speaks about his family. He's a little crazy. The isolation has put him to a point where he wants to return to his people, and will do whatever it takes to get back with them, however, he also seems to be, in a weird way that you can read, appreciative that you're willing to help, and seems to be, on his part, genuine. As a note, music's not playing? I don't know if there's a reason for that.
Travis: Did he say his eyes, the flayer's eyes, are what put people in trances, or their minds?
Sam: Yeah, the eyes, the eyes.
Travis: So if we wear helmets, it's not gonna help us.
Sam: No, the helmet is what separates him from his hive mind. It wouldn't help us at all.
Travis: I'll still wear the big bronze pot on my head.
Matt: You put the pot on your head. It's clunky.
Travis: On my whole head.
Matt: You cannot see with the pot on your head.
Travis: No, but I'm protected from the flayer.
Sam: Can you bore two like, ghost holes in?
Travis: I don't need it, I have incredible warrior skills.
Taliesin: Do their powers work with reflection?
Matt: "No, they can peer into your very mind."
Taliesin: But if we approach them using a reflective surface to view them, can they peer into our minds through a reflected surface?
Matt: "If they know you're there, you're in sight, they can read into you."
Travis: Shit.
Marisha: They can read our minds.
Matt: "If you are obscured, unknown to them, then you are hidden. They cannot sense you, but if they know you are there, they can peer, they can pry."
Liam: Is there any way to be hidden for us?
Matt: "Hidden from sight. Be hidden from knowledge. Be hidden from them."
Marisha: Clarence? Sorry, Clarota.
Sam: How about Clay?
Matt: "Clarota!"
Travis: Jesus.
Marisha: Sorry, Clarota. I just have one quick question. Why would you want to rejoin your colony after they've banished you? Why not leave?
Matt: "I have nowhere to go. They are my essence, my connection. I long to return. It is the way of my people, I understand this curse I hold. I spite myself, I look upon this disease, and spit. But perhaps, with this deed, they can overlook it."
Marisha: You're not diseased, you're special.
Travis: Oh, God.
Sam: Question, Clarota.
Matt: "You know nothing of my culture. You presume too much."
Liam: I think we do understand your desires though, and we can align ours with yours. So let us speak of specifics, Clarota.
Sam: Strategy.
Liam: Strategy.
Sam: Number one, that assortment of dwarves and some of your friends and ogres over there on the other side of the chasm. Is that something that we need to face headlong, or can we maybe surpass them, trying to find K'varn, or this temple that you speak of?
Matt: "We may if you wish. Their stronghold is far below. The magma leads the way. However, if I know what I've seen, the general resides in that camp. I know no way within the stronghold, without the brunt of their army. Perhaps the general can be pried for information. If you bring him to me."
Sam: "Bring him," so you won't be accompanying us on any adventure, or...?
Matt: "I will be coming."
Orion: We have to fetch him.
Sam: And the general is in that...
Orion: Where you were, right?
Sam: Yes, yes. So we have to go over.
Ashley: Did you say something about a temple, or did I completely misunderstand?
Matt: "There is a temple in our city. Where my people reside, that is where the Elder Brain sits."
Sam: We'll get there eventually, but first step is this smaller force across the chasm.
Travis: Yeah, we're gonna put the beat down. (all laugh)
Orion: Well said, Grog.
Marisha: You said there was a big army front, guarding this general? Of duergar?
Sam: Well, the general's right across the chasm.
Marisha: Oh, he's just right across the way?
Matt: "Their forces are gathering there. The bulk of their army currently is divided between that and the stronghold below."
Liam: Percy shot this one, I think.
Taliesin: I did.
Liam: I think it's important to point out that your kin, this general, is aware of at least three of us, of my dragonborn friend, the singer over here, and myself.
Sam: I don't think he knows about me.
Travis: No, you were invisible.
Liam: Just us, then.
Orion: I don't even know if he saw me. He saw my funny cards.
Liam: True, it could be just me then.
Orion: Oh, I cast Prestidigitation on Pike and I clean her up real quick.
Liam: You look lovely. How do you think your kin will react to that? What will their response be if they know that outsiders have come? If they've seen just me at this moment, plus a few illusions.
Matt: "They will be prepared. So you must find another way in. You must think how to not be seen."
Travis: Think. (all laugh)
Orion: Don't worry, Grog.
Matt: You've never ever, in your life, ever heard someone else chuckle inside your brain, but you hear within the center of yours: (chuckles) "Think, yes."
Travis: Oh ho, it echoes in the pot. (all laugh) But I start laughing to myself. (silly laughter)
Liam: Can I assume that you would have already given us any advice by now if you knew a way? Are we stuck with our own resources?
Matt: "I've only watched from a distance. Getting too close was too dangerous. I only read surface thoughts. If I were seen, I would be nothing, I would be destroyed."
Liam: So no back doors, no secret entrances that you know of, into the camp, anywhere near this general?
Matt: "None."
Liam: Fuck.
Travis: What's in the bottom of the crevasse?
Sam: It's water and magma.
Travis: Can we pick up the little loch ness monster and throw it at him or something?
Sam: Oh yes, down below, in the waters, our allies - Vex, and uh, somebody. (all laugh) Found some creatures under the water, snatching bodies as they fell. Keyleth. Yes, I forgot who went.
Orion: Her majesty, Keyleth.
Sam: Pike's beauty distracted me, you shouldn't have cleaned her up so nice.
Orion: I'm sorry.
Sam: Anyway, there were some creatures down below in the waters, are those anything that we could use, or should we just avoid them?
Matt: You see it actually hisses for a second, as soon as you mention this he goes, "No, avoid. That creature is older than all of us. It resides there, an ancient mind. One that should be Kept at bay. An aboleth."
Sam: Do you need a lozenge? (all laugh)
Matt: Its eyes narrow once again, not quite understanding the words you use, seemingly amused.
Sam: It's a gnome thing.
Matt: As a brief aside, too, I checked the connection on my iPad, I'm playing music fine, and the connection's in the iPad, I don't quite know where it's losing its connection. But I think we need some music.
Sam: All right, so let's review our options, shall we?
Travis: We're gonna charge in there.
Sam: We can't charge, there's a chasm.
Liam: How did that go with the little brain thing? Not too well.
Taliesin: The chasm is a problem.
Sam: Master switch.
Marisha: An entire colony of mind flayers.
Sam: We could fly in, right?
Liam: The bridge is gone, we have to--
Sam: We can fly in death from above.
Travis: I don't know if I can.
Sam: Well, we can figure out a way. Enough of us can turn into flying things to get you there.
Taliesin: We also have a flying carpet. We can repair the bridge if we had to, at least put a rope across.
Ashley: I think--
Sam: Or we could disguise ourselves somehow.
Ashley: I think I know where we need to go.
Sam: What?
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Really?
Liam: Get out of this city.
Marisha: Please, do tell.
Sam: So, hold on-- (static) (music)
Matt: There we go.
Sam: There's music.
Ashley: Oh wait, I think I read this wrong. (all laugh)
Sam: Pike, don't toy with our emotions.
Travis: You just got back.
Ashley: So you guys haven't gone to the war camp.
Sam: We have.
Ashley: You have.
Sam: We been there and we quickly retreated.
Liam: Scanlan took a poke about. He boofed himself out of sight and had a look around, and then we returned to the edge of it, and I kind of flipped the bird at them, and taunted them a little, but most of us haven't been in.
Ashley: Have you been to the lake?
Travis: None of us went in the water.
Sam: Lake? No, there's no-- what, there's a lake?
Ashley: Isn't that where that thing is?
Travis: The bottom of the crevasse, right?
Liam: Under the bridge, there was--
Sam: No, that's rushing water, that's not--
Matt: The area after the big drop that was at the bottom, there was a lake of water. And there was a waterfall coming out of the natural--
Liam: And the ogres were getting sucked under by something.
Travis: So we didn't go down there.
Marisha: Is there something under the lake?
Ashley: Well I just-- I don't know if I should be talking about this in front of him.
Travis: We could go away from him for a second.
Liam: He will probably hear the thoughts inside your mind.
Orion: Clarota is totally fine to talk in front of. He's amazing.
Ashley: Earmuffs. (all laugh)
Ashley: Well, shall I share a vision I had?
Liam: I think so, Pike. I think at this point, we should just move forward.
Ashley: In this vision that I had, I was pulled down toward the mines. Into the tunnels, below where the dwarves were working.
Marisha: Through the lake?
Ashley: Well, past the goblinoid creatures, and past a great underground lake. Past a jagged onyx colored fortress, framed in molten rock.
Travis: We haven't been there yet.
Ashley: Past a field of broken glass and bone. Have you seen any of this?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No.
Travis: I don't think an onyx fortress.
Orion: Those last things sound terrible.
Liam: Yes, that all sounds shitty. (all laugh)
Liam: The last thing we've seen is the lake, and we didn't go too close to it, because a couple of ogres fell in from above, and they disappeared like something grabbed them.
Travis: We didn't have him fly down there and get a close look.
Liam: No, we haven't had a look around.
Ashley: I wonder if there's like--
Marisha: I can cast Water Breathing on all of us.
Travis: Why don't we send one, like Mars Rover over here, and have him go check it out?
Marisha: I can always turn into, like, a whale.
Liam: Perhaps, but the water breathing sounds good to me. I feel like a head-on--
Travis: Isn't there something in the water?
Liam: -- run into the chasm is a bad idea.
Orion: I pull out my empty bottle, and I go, and I have this!
Liam: Yes, he's got a bottle, plus, we've killed a fucking dragon. I know it's not an easy task to accomplish, but we're pretty badass, I think. We might have a good chance.
Marisha: So wait, is going through the lake gonna get us through to the general?
Liam: Well, we don't know.
Travis: We haven't been down to the water's surface.
Sam: What's the best-case scenario? What, we come up behind them? It's still gonna be a fight.
Travis: But maybe there's a different vantage point.
Sam: We can fly over them, that seems like a pretty good attack point.
Taliesin: Some of us can fly over them.
Marisha: Well we can figure out to where where all of us can fly over them. I'm more concerned about us cloaking ourselves. Even if we're flying they're still going to see us.
Sam: There's an ancient death thing down there.
Travis: He might die, didn't say it was foolproof.
Sam: I don't know, man, he's volunteering you.
Orion: Wait, what's going on?
Liam: I mean, our options are we can vote on it, although we all know Keyleth is just gonna go fucking do whatever she wants. Our options are--
Marisha: That was one time.
Liam: Just the one time.
Marisha: Just one time.
Travis: Never to be forgotten.
Liam: Our options are a headlong advance into the middle of their camp. That's a big fucking force.
Sam: Or some sort of disguise, distraction.
Travis: Tiberius.
Matt: Is the stream down by the way?
Zac: It goes down every two hours and 17 minutes, it's been doing that for-- It comes right back up.
Matt: All right, so let us know when it's back up.
Sam: Two hours and 17 minutes, that sounds like Lost or something.
Travis: Tiberius. Do it.
Marisha: Amityville Twitch stream.
Travis: Go fly all the way down to the water's surface. Like Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future 2, and check out if there's any other tunnels that we haven't seen, or ways to go.
Orion: Isn't this the same water that you bended?
Marisha: I think so.
Travis: We didn't go down to the water's surface though, did we?
Marisha: Well, we went over the top of it, and kind of looked down.
Travis: Oh, we did? We went all the way down?
Marisha: When I was bending the water back, we were kind of in that area, right? That was that area, but the lake--
Sam: Do it smart. Let's go bomb them.
Ashley: What if, I mean--
Travis: Can you freeze it?
Ashley: Do you guys wanna like, put me down on a rope, and I can just run around, see if there's any openings? I mean I have a lot of armor.
Liam: Go fishing with you?
Marisha: Go fishing, yeah.
Ashley: Well no, just like halfway, and then I can run around and look for tunnels. Well some of us can fly, so we're okay.
Marisha: I can attempt to try and drain the lake a little bit.
Liam: And Keyleth said that she can cast Water Breathing, can help us breathe underneath the surface.
Travis: We have two underwater breathing potions.
Marisha: Control Water's a level five spell.
Matt: I realize that. But that's a lot of water.
Travis: But remember, we're slow as balls in water.
Liam: You were having trouble, if I recall, just getting the waterfall out of the way to create, I mean it was amazing, but--
Marisha: I managed to get it stopped--
Liam: I know, you fucking saved the day, but we're talking about--
Marisha: A lake.
Liam: Yeah, Lake Superior.
Sam: This is not just a lake, there is a death monster in there. If we go under the water, we're dead.
Travis: Can we stand on it? Anything, if we wanna fight it? Or are we gonna be fighting it in the water?
Taliesin: Well, we can all have Water Breathing.
Travis: Yeah, but we'll be slow.
Sam: And we'll be underwater, where there's a death monster.
Travis: I'm not worried about that part of the question.
Liam: There's 50 to 100 fucking creeps up top.
Sam: Well, then let's come up with a good plan.
Ashley: Maybe there's hidden stairs or something, like in Indiana Jones?
Travis: Can you electrify the water and fry the guy?
Liam: Hold up, hold up.
Orion: There's only 26 people up there. On our last count.
Taliesin: Before the ones we killed, or after?
Orion: After.
Liam: Those are the ones we saw, though. How do we know how far back the camp goes? How many are in the gate behind it?
Travis: Don't a couple of you have Lightning? Can't you deep-fry the water?
Marisha: I mean, I can make a giant whirlpool.
Liam: Wait a second, wait a second. Clarota, you've been listening to our thoughts for the last ten minutes.
Sam: And what clear thoughts they have been.
Liam: What do you think? What do you think?
Matt: "What resides in that lake is something you wish not to tamper with. An ancient mind."
Travis: Blah blah blah. Hodie-fucking-ho.
Matt: "It clouds the water with its own filth. You find yourself unable to breathe air."
Marisha: Didn't that happen already?
Matt: "Its mind, it takes--"
Liam: Have you seen it?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: It's big?
Matt: "It's rather large."
Ashley: Is it like a many-armed ...situation? (all laugh)
Matt: "One could say, yes."
Ashley: Okay. Swell.
Liam: What's the sitch?
Marisha: So we can face Cthulhu, or little Cthulhu minons, seems to be our choice.
Orion: Clarota.
Travis: Why don't I have Lightning, I swear. Can't you fry the water first? See if it hurts it?
Sam: We can fly overhead and just Lightning the shit out of it.
Travis: Do that, please. 'Cause maybe there's a way-- there's a tunnel, and we come up behind them or whatever it was.
Liam: That illithid took out my brain from like 100 feet.
Sam: You know what-- wait, wait, if I may. When I was there, I saw the main general control all of them instantly, when he was about to make a sacrifice, or feed, or whatever he was doing. No offense. He instantly had all of their command. If we could somehow get to him, and cut off that connection, distract him, influence him somehow to command them to all jump in the lake, for instance. That would get rid of a lot of them all at once.
Liam: Can you make me invisible?
Sam: I can get you there. I can make you unseeable, but not invisible.
Liam: What?
Travis: What's the difference?
Sam: I can make you a fly.
Taliesin: May I examine-- without removing-- may I examine your device?
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Travis: Oh man, Percy, Percy.
Sam: What's he doing?
Orion: He's asking to--
Taliesin: 16.
Liam: What's he doing?
Sam: Touching the hat.
Matt: He glares at you and says, "Our agreement does not include this interaction."
Taliesin: It may be the key to returning you to your people.
Travis: Tiberius.
Orion: Yes?
Travis: Would you go fry the fucking lake?
Taliesin: I won't touch. I will just look.
Orion: I'm reading my book.
Travis: No, I want you to--
Matt: It kind of bows its head, but does not move closer. It just slightly shows you an element of it.
Taliesin: Can I understand how it functions?
Matt: Best you can tell it looks like a skullcap that's been kind of decently made for what it is, but you can see some of the hammer marks on it, or whatever it was put together. It appears to be a very simple piece of metallic material.
Taliesin: So it's magic.
Matt: It looks like it is some sort of enchantment, probably what's causing the effect. It's not any mechanical device that causes it.
Travis: (metal clanging)
Taliesin: So there'd be no way to build something to create a feedback loop?
Marisha: Ooh. I see what you're getting at.
Taliesin: I wanna try and see if there's any way that I can take a look at this and figure out a way to build some sort of feedback system.
Marisha: We need to build a coconut radio.
Sam: We don't even have a laboratory.
Taliesin: He wants a coconut radio.
Orion: I love coconuts.
Matt: You have never interacted with anything psionic-based before. The time to research that, and the materials needed to do it would take months.
Taliesin: Plan two--
Liam: This is a fairly shitty situation.
Travis: While all this is going on!
Taliesin: Because if they can't see, what if we blind them?
Liam: How?
Marisha: With some sort of interference?
Taliesin: With a really bright light.
Orion: Oh, I love doing light things.
Taliesin: What if they are so blind they can't actually see us coming?
Marisha: I believe Pike and I both have access to spells like that.
Sam: I assume that would make us pretty blind as well.
Marisha: Not necessarily.
Ashley: Not if we wear our--
Sam: -- sunglasses? (all laugh)
Taliesin: Can I attempt to build sunglasses?
Sam: Before we build sunglasses--
Matt: You can probably make a couple with the materials you have on hand. You are limited when it comes to resources, as you are currently halfway underground.
Taliesin: Even better.
Travis: Vax could show his ass, that's a pretty white light.
Taliesin: That's as white as it gets.
Liam: It's pale as shit. When I go to the beach, I don't tan, I stroke.
Sam: But I thought we established that they don't need visual contact to influence us, they just need to be able to be aware--
Taliesin: Once they have visual contact they can influence us, but they need to make that visual contact in the first place.
Matt: "The dark, deep dwarves, they hate light. This I know."
Marisha: I think it'll stun them long enough for us to get across.
Taliesin: If we could perhaps put some Light spells on the back and the front of our shields, so that we are guarded from it.
Orion: If you can make a pair for our friend here, that would help him out, I assume.
Marisha: Wait, that's not a bad idea. Pike, can we temporarily enchant the magic carpet as a spotlight as we fly over? As a light death ray?
Liam: We've seen you surrounded in radiant light before, you think you can do that to the carpet?
Ashley: I mean, I have--
Marisha: We should have Daylight. Where's my book? Where's my Player's Handbook?
Liam: And Clarota, while they're figuring that out, if we remain to be hidden or blind our opponents as we approach your kin, will not know our thoughts 'til they see us?
Matt: "Yes. They need to look into you, by knowing you're there."
Liam: Can I fight one of your kin with a blindfold on?
Matt: "Perhaps."
Travis: I thought if they could see you--
Orion: Clarota. The mind hive that you possess, how close can one be before it actually affects? Say 100 feet, caught my friend in mid air, alas, in their run-in. Is its range about--?
Matt: "That's about the distance, yes."
Sam: You may not know the answer to this. I don't doubt your knowledge and wisdom, but I happen to have a ring with mind shielding, will that aid me in any way?
Matt: "It may. If it gives you resistance to psionic influence, it would be of aid, yes."
Marisha: Daylight.
Travis: Do we have a plan?
Liam: It wouldn't be hard to get hold of some pitch down here, some tar.
Sam: To burn?
Liam: No. If you can be invisible, and you have a ring of mind shielding, and you can carry a bucket of pitch to that motherfucker, you can splash it on its face, cover its eyes, and it's helpless.
Taliesin: My God.
Sam: Or I can hang that big brass pot on its head.
Travis: But I'm wearing that.
Liam: Yes, but it could take it off, possibly. If you smear sticky shit on its eyes--
Sam: So wait, I just have to blind it?
Liam: Then it can't control--
Sam: Well, I happen to have a Blindness spell!
Matt: "It may still try, but to be blind, it would be very difficult for it to pry into your mind."
Sam: Could it still control the others, though?
Matt: "Probably. That is a permanent enslavement."
Sam: So you want me to go in there, solo, invisible, and try to blind this thing.
Liam: No, not solo.
Sam: I'm in!
Liam: I like your idea of turning me into a fly. You and I go in--
Taliesin: And we've got Light spells.
Marisha: Pike and I can cast Daylight on our magic carpet.
Ashley: I can cast it onto my shield, and then on the carpet, and we would have a double--
Marisha: I have to take a nap, though. What's that?
Liam: But that could get us in close. Scanlan and I could get in closer, and blind it, and I could stab it in the head.
Marisha: I mean, technically I can also turn into something flying, I could back you guys up, if someone else wants to take the carpet.
Sam: We can all get there. We can all get there.
Marisha: I can cast Daylight on your helmet. On your pot helmet.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: That I'm game with
Marisha: All right.
Travis: I'll be like a lighthouse, walking around. Crushing life. (all laugh)
Matt: You'd be the cover of John Carpenter's "The Thing."
Liam: Did everyone hear Percy, that's a good idea.
Taliesin: Two fronts.
Liam: Yes, two fronts.
Sam: What is it?
Liam: You and I separate from the group, they go in shining like a beacon, you and I (buzzes) in, and while the illithid is focused on them, we go in, you blind him, and I stab him in his maw. It's pretty good.
Sam: That's a suicide mission.
Travis: I like it, let's do it.
Liam: What else are we going to do?
Taliesin: I'm behind this plan.
Sam: Surgical, special ops, seal team six.
Marisha: What does Vax have to say about this?
Liam: Vex, you mean? My sister Vex?
Marisha: Yes, that one.
Liam: That's a good question.
Sam: Oh, Vex, you look so tired.
Matt: Vex, your sister seems genuinely perturbed by the circumstance, but looks to you and says, "Look, I found him, you deal with the situation. Just tell me what to do."
Sam: She's so like that. (all laugh) ASHLEY Let's do it.
Liam: I gave up trying to understand her years ago.
Marisha: Do you know what time it is? I'm feeling a bit nappy.
Orion: Your hair looks fine.
Liam: Well, I--
Sam: Wait-- (shushes)
Matt: "If you need rest, then rest. Time of day has no bearing down here."
Marisha: I have to rest so I can-- I'm gonna read up on this Daylight spell, so that you and me can both cast it. ASHLEY Yeah, we'll just take a nap and just get, you know, rest our muscles, and get ready for the fight.
Travis: I'm gonna read up on this Chopping Head spell. Yep, I'm read up.
Sam: I'm gonna sing a little song to inspire a couple of my allies here, if I can.
Matt: Okay, I would recommend doing it after rest. The dice would go away while they rest.
Sam: Okay, forget it.
Marisha: I go ahead and I light an incense in our teepee, and I make some flowers grow. That's better. That's nice.
Taliesin: I'm gonna do a little bit of work on that first trick arrow. On the trap arrow. Since I've got a little time.
Matt: Go ahead and make a roll.
Taliesin: That's a-- What am I rolling?
Matt: Your engineering-- your tinker's kit.
Taliesin: Oh, it's just an intelligence roll, right?
Matt: Plus your tinker's kit proficiency. It's down underneath your skills. Proficiency, at the very bottom left.
Taliesin: Yeah, I don't have a number for that.
Matt: You can add your proficiency modifier to your intelligence check. Add your intelligence modifier plus four.
Taliesin: Ah, thank you. 17.
Matt: All right, and so what are you trying to accomplish with this arrow again?
Taliesin: I was just trying to make an entanglement arrow. It's a trapper's arrow.
Matt: Okay. You manage to work out what seems like a tanglefoot bag-type detonation, where if an arrow were fired, it would be a grapple check against the individual, probably give them penalties until they're able to break free of the grapple. So yeah, success on that one.
Travis: Nice job, Doogie.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be Hawkeyeing Laura out at some point, I got a couple of them.
Orion: Before I retire, Clarota, you said you wanted to speak with me later. Anything in particular, or you wish to save it for after the battle?
Matt: "Perhaps after. I just am curious about the source of your Arcane power."
Orion: Ooh, I'd be happy to discuss it. I could learn a great deal from you as well.
Matt: "Later."
Orion: Later, of course. I go to my books.
Matt: So Clarota closes his eyes, and kind of goes into a meditative stance. The rest of you, those who have spells to choose, go ahead and choose your spells accordingly for the next day.
Travis: Rub it in. I'm sharpening my ax.
Matt: Good. Good.
Travis: It is good.
Sam: Just doing my vocal warmups. ♫ Me me me me me me me me me ♫
Marisha: I'm meditating.
Sam: ♫ Molto bene, molto bene, molto bene, molto bene ♫
Travis: The human torch was denied a bank loan. (all laugh)
Matt: So as you all have your evening's rest... Not very comfortable. Number one, you're in the middle of a tent of a goblinoid city. Second, just the general proximity of sleeping near an illithid, you just have a general sense of unsettling dreams, imagery that is disturbing. Pike, you have many flashbacks to the vision you had, and actually wake partway through the night in a cold sweat. As you wake up, you all kind of slowly come to, it's about four hours into the evening's rest. You feel a slight tremor, a familiar tremor that you felt once before in this cavern. (rumbling) You feel the ground begin to vibrate and shake.
Taliesin: I get up and look around.
Sam: Is Clay awake? (all laugh)
Matt: Eyes are open, just sitting there.
Sam: Clarota, do you know what that rumbling is?
Matt: "There are many creatures that live in this rock. You'd best be still."
Sam: Ooh, still.
Matt: "Still."
Orion: Don't move.
Travis: So, vocal warm ups.
Matt: Everyone make a stealth check.
Marisha: Oh!
Travis: Fucking nipples.
Marisha: Pooper.
Travis: We get advantage on that, right?
Matt: Nope!
Orion: 16.
Sam: 14.
Marisha: 19.
Taliesin: 18.
Liam: 20.
Ashley: One.
Travis: One. (all laugh)
Matt: Two natural ones?
Travis: Yup!
Sam: After her two natural 20's.
Liam: Nothing to add.
Ashley: Nothing to add. Well I'm new to armor, you know.
Matt: You both rolled natural ones. Those both count as two failures.
Ashley: Fuck.
Matt: Thankfully, the rest of your group all rolled pretty high. So it was four versus five.
Orion: Yes!
Matt: You guys just barely succeed. As you all hold still, barely breathe, the rumbling intensifies, and goes on for a good minute, minute and a half, before it eventually subsides.
Travis: Aw. Thought we were gonna get a warm up.
Matt: Fades into the distance. Rumbling is complete. It appears to be no issue. Clarota says, "Many of these creatures, they pick up on movement, in that sound, be wary."
Liam: What creatures are you speaking of now? Is this something--
Sam: The rumbling creatures.
Liam: But what are they?
Orion: Probably buttholes.
Matt: "I've only got glimpses."
Liam: This is something worse than umberhulks, I assume.
Matt: "Larger, yes."
Sam: All right, we've all rested up.
Liam: Buttholes in the underdark!
Sam: I had a crazy dream. It said if Geek & Sundry got to 1,400 followers, there would be some sort of a giveaway.
Orion: Oh, I had the same dream, Scanlan!
Sam: Wow!
Matt: Yeah guys, just so you're aware, every 50 subscribers we get, we are giving away an awesome Geek & Sundry game package.
Zac: Ethanmyhead just won one.
Matt: Oh, there you go, congratulations! We already got a winner. We'll be putting those out for every 50 subscribers we get tonight. We'll be choosing one to win that awesome award, our wonderful package, so keep that in mind.
Sam: So the plan is again, you and I, stealth. The rest, attack with light? What's first, what's second, what happens here?
Liam: Well, I need to take a moment to find some-- I'm gonna look around and see if I can find any pitch, anywhere in the goblin camp.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a survival check. Actually, this would be investigation.
Liam: Investigation. I got the exact same number, 12.
Matt: Takes about an hour. You manage to find, essentially, a few piles of rather disgusting, sticky, goblinoid refuse, that you imagine will probably stick and burn pretty well. In a pitch-type way, yeah.
Liam: Goblin shit?
Matt: You find just a whole bunch of goblin shit.
Liam: Let's cook it up a little.
Taliesin: How do you feel about lacing it with gun powder?
Sam: I'll make some fire for you.
Liam: Feel pretty good about that.
Marisha: Goblin molotov cocktails? I like that.
Taliesin: Goblin poop cocktail.
Liam: So here's how I think this goes. I think the team infuses the carpet, and any shields, or head pots they have with radiant light. They go in and make a big stink on the side of the camp. You and I go in, you're invisible. I'm a--
Sam: Fly, flea, mosquito, dragonfly, whatever you'd like.
Liam: Yes, let's say fly. We go in, find the illithid, and then we pop in, you yell, "Hey, Spanky," throw goblin shit in its face.
Sam: Or I try to blind it with magic.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: Both.
Orion: Both! Why not both?
Liam: We want to increase our odds. As soon as he's blind, I go in for the kill. And then it's on us to deal with what happens after that.
Travis: It's playtime.
Liam: It's playtime.
Sam: Might I suggest one other wrinkle.
Liam: Yes, please do.
Sam: Remember there are some dwarves being held captive. We can make our way to them and release them.
Travis: We don't need all of them, though. Just to cause further distraction, or to get some allies on the inside.
Liam: It's possible they could be weary, frightened.
Taliesin: Mind controlled.
Liam: Seems unreliable-- yes, mind controlled.
Travis: They're probably ready to fight, like me. (all laugh)
Sam: Grog, we understand, you want to bash some things.
Liam: Your time to kill is coming.
Sam: All right, is there anyone else in the party who could help us with stealth, or anything?
Ashley: Definitely not me.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Clang clang. ASHLEY Clang clang clang clang.
Matt: As a note, just remember. Because you're the one who walked through. There is essentially a shanty town, a tent city of war tents. With a few rock formations. You also notice that, or you remember last time, that there was the main square that had the raised platform. And then there was the small stone barracks, where it seemed both the mind flayer and the duergar general both went back in.
Sam: So we gotta go into the barracks.
Matt: Well that's where you saw at least they were last time you were there.
Liam: That's our starting point, I imagine.
Orion: Well, there's two targets.
Sam: So we gotta get in, and then get in.
Liam: The main thing is to get the illithid, because if he's out, nobody's-- Then they're all separate. He's playing chess with all his minions until we take him out.
Travis: I hate chess.
Orion: So we all strike right on him. You two are going to take that little journey. The rest of us, what shall we do? I have many options and they're all fun. So Percy. Your sniper rifle. I should think that you want to post up and start taking out position.
Taliesin: I'll do that at first, but then eventually I'm going to just have to jump into the fray.
Orion: Yes, of course, onslaught to the rest of the camp, that we'll go about it too, right? Make a bunch of noise, a bunch of light.
Sam: How are you going to get Grog over there?
Marisha: I'm gonna put a giant sunlight beacon on his head, and I'm gonna release him to the wilds.
Liam: Yes, but there's no bridge, we talked about--
Marisha: Oh, how are we gonna get him over it?
Liam: We have an infinite amount of rope.
Sam: How do we get it over there?
Liam: Tiberius talks about making him light as a feather.
Travis: Or you can fly me.
Sam: Yes, you can fly him, right?
Orion: Perhaps you can fly.
Travis: Why don't we turn my pot into a lighthouse, and then you fly me over, and I'll do like, abominable snow man walk.
Marisha: I like that.
Liam: Clarota, is there anything you can do to help us on this endeavor?
Matt: "I can try to cloud his mind with mine, but you have to swear to protect me from harm."
Liam: You have our word.
Sam: -- that we will try. (all laugh)
Matt: "Then I will come. You must work swiftly. If we can leap most of the city, get to that barrack, storm it, and take out the mind flayer that resides."
Sam: Let's set down right in the middle of the thing.
Marisha: Well I was gonna say, can we set down where we're kind of backing you guys up, holding the fort down while you guys go?
Liam: There's no bridge.
Sam: We all have to get there.
Marisha: I'm not worried about that.
Liam: Get over together, get to the edge.
Sam: Yes, but where are we going to make land? In the middle of the shit, next to the barracks?
Marisha: I say we might as well go closest to the barracks as we can get.
Sam: Okay, then you and I can get in the barracks.
Liam: That's a good idea. If we go as high as we can, and just hug the ceiling of this motherfucker, and then go down in the middle. And as we're going down, you turn me into a fly and go invisible, and that's when all hell breaks lose.
Travis: I like that part. Let's do it.
Liam: No time like the present.
Travis: Hands up if you're in.
Marisha: I'm gonna start buffing people like crazy.
Orion: I cast Stoneskin.
Taliesin: Gonna be buffing us like a vampire slayer.
Marisha: Oh! Joss Whedon up in this bitch!
Sam: Question to the dungeon master.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: I think my Polymorph spell is a concentration spell.
Matt: It is, yes.
Sam: I'm going solo. (sighs)
Travis: Do it.
Sam: I can get you in. I can make you a fly, but I can't be invisible at the same time.
Liam: I will sneak through. If shit goes south, I will peel off and join the others.
Marisha: Well, I can cast Pass Without A Trace on myself, and as long as we hug close to me, there's an area around me that's like a dark shadow. We get like, all stealthy.
Sam: We're going in.
Liam: We're just gonna have to improvise that. We'll do it live, we'll do it live.
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait! Don't go in yet. Let me buff people.
Matt: You said you were casting Stoneskin? Stoneskin is concentration. The moment you cast another concentration spell, it goes away.
Orion: Oh, right. So I don't cast it, then. (all laugh) God damned concentration spells.
Travis: I would like to cast, um. (all laugh)
Travis: Blood Lust on myself. Blood Lust.
Marisha: I go ahead and I cast Enhance Ability on Vex.
All: Vax.
Liam: Sorry, everybody does it. Our mother did it, I do it sometimes.
Matt: To increase his dexterity?
Marisha: To increase your dexterity.
Matt: So essentially you have advantage on dexterity-based checks, yeah.
Marisha: Which is your stealth, right?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: And then I'm gonna go ahead and let me keep track of all this. And I'm gonna go ahead and cast Daylight on Grog's helmet. Are we ready for this, are we going?
Sam: Yeah, let's go.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And I'm gonna go ahead and cast Daylight on--
Sam: Wait.
Travis: What?
Sam: Wait. We're trying to sneak over them before we land. Don't cast Daylight on anything yet. We don't wanna be bright and shiny in the sky.
Matt: A giant flare coasting over the city.
Travis: We'll be like UFO's.
Liam: (hissing)
Marisha: I'm gonna go ahead and cast Pass Without A Trace on myself.
Matt: All right, so that's preparation there.
Sam: I'm gonna sing a little ditty to inspire Vax. ♫ I didn't see the Vax ♫ 'Cause he's so goddamned stealthy ♫ Da da da da da da da da
Travis: Was that "I Saw The Sun"?
Sam: Yes it was. (all laugh)
Matt: That wondrous rendition allows you a d8 inspiration dice, hold on to that.
Orion: Is everybody finished?
Liam: Vox Machina, let's do this shit.
Marisha: I turn into an eagle, and I'll take the gnomes.
Matt: All right. Scanlan. Pike is heavy with the plate mail, but it's still enough to carry with your giant eagle form.
Liam: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet, and Tiberius, are you good to help Grog fly across?
Orion: Fly.
Matt: At which point you feel this strange lifting sensation, for a second your stomach kind of has butterflies, and you realize that you can just think forward, and you drift forward. Think back, you drift back. Think up, you drift up.
Travis: Amazing, don't puke in the helmet though, that would be gross. (imitates puking)
Orion: Am I light enough for him to take me in?
Travis: I can't see anything. Just a cauldron on my head.
Orion: For him to carry me.
Matt: For him to carry you? Yeah, yeah.
Orion: I hop on your back. Let's go, Grog.
Travis: Great.
Marisha: I guess the rest of them are on the rug?
Travis: I can't see, so you gotta tell me. I start flying the wrong way.
Orion: Back up, the other way, other way, very good.
Matt: You actually clutch Grog by the sides of his face, and start steering him. (all laugh)
Orion: Wherever I move your head, just tilt that way.
Sam: Are we all in flight now?
Liam: We're all taken care of, yes.
Sam: And the carpet?
Liam: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet.
Sam: What about Vex? Is she with us?
Ashley: She's on the carpet.
Sam: She's staying behind.
Matt: Vex, for the time being, because it's just easier to organize for that, is coming on the carpet with you guys, and is preparing in case she is needed.
Taliesin: She's just quiet 'cause she's feeling smug about the last game.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: She's feeling smug about making another RPG right now.
Liam: She'll be back.
Sam: I wanna see how you fly, Grog.
Orion: It's really rickety!
Travis: It's one arm in and one forward. (all laugh)
Orion: Just think.
Liam: Do you propel yourself with thoughts?
Matt: It's an awkward zig zag.
Taliesin: Do you think happy thoughts?
Marisha: I'm gonna fly in the middle between Grog and the carpet, that way my Pass Without A Trace encompasses everybody.
Matt: All right.
Liam: I turn to Scanlan and say, Scanlan, we are probably going to die today. It has been an honor.
Sam: It has been an honor.
Ashley: You won't die today.
Sam: Only one of us will die. And it won't be me. I can be invisible. (all laugh)
Orion: You're not listening, it'll just happen.
Liam: What were you saying Tiberius?
Orion: Nothing.
Liam: Don't play it that way, what were you saying?
Orion: I was saying, if you're all finished, I'll just make you invisible right before it happens.
Matt: You guys are all coasting over the chasm. Now you're over the top of the large bridge, and the 200-foot-wide open hole in this tunnel that leads to the lake below. As you glance down, you can see just a little bit of a trickle from the soft red light that is deeper inside. You can see the small streams of lava, they're just slowly pooling at the bottom on the outskirts of the lake proper. As you begin to make it to the other side, you can see tiny shapes moving in this barely lit war camp of the duergar. As you're coasting over, and Clarota is along with you guys with his hood up, he kind of whispers into all of your heads, just, "Beware that some of these armies carry abominations created below within my city. I know not what to expect from them. So be wary." As this happens, everyone make a stealth check. Everyone, because of the Pass Without A Track, everyone gets a plus ten to their stealth check.
Travis: Plus ten?
Matt: Plus ten. Thanks to Keyleth.
Sam: Thank God.
Matt: Keyleth, however, you are carrying two gnomes, so you have a disadvantage on it.
Ashley: Oh no.
Liam: It's all right.
Marisha: Even with the plus 10? 18?
Matt: 18.
Sam: 15.
Taliesin: 22.
Travis: 27.
Sam: Wow.
Ashley: 23.
Liam: 28.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to crest over the very top of the war camp, and looking down you can see now, there are what looks to be the beginnings of tunneling siege engines being constructed.
Sam: What? Siege?
Matt: Siege. You can see giant wheeled carts with drills up front, giant auger bores that are being currently constructed. You can see what looks like a series of weapons being stacked at the ready. You can see there is a preparation for some sort of attack on the city above.
Liam: Want to take Kraghammer.
Matt: Continue to press ahead. There does not seem to be any reaction to your flying.
Sam: Don't say anything.
Liam: This close to the ceiling.
Ashley: Good thing we didn't cast the light.
Orion: We can all talk to each other.
Sam: Whisper to each other. Shut up!
Marisha: Oh, cool.
Sam: Just wait 'til we get there.
Matt: You guys make it towards the center portion of the city.
Travis: Roll shake it, roll shake it, roll shake it.
Taliesin: Die rolls.
Matt: You can just start beginning to see the opening in the center of this war camp. There is a circle where there are no tents constructed, you can see what looks to be a small wooden platform, and there is a stone building that is of makeshift functional construction. Not pretty, but functional, looks like a barracks, or some sort of a large bunker. Right on the northern side of that opening, that center portion of the war camp. That would be what you saw, both the general and the mind flayer head of this encampment go into last time you--
Sam: The barracks.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: With a roof?
Matt: There is a roof to it, you don't know if there's any roof access. But there is a roof.
Liam: Tiberius, can you turn me invisible now.
Orion: (sputtering)
Sam: But we're still in the air, right? He's gotta concentrate on that.
Liam: He's sitting on the carpet.
Sam: Yeah but he's--
Marisha: Thinking about--
Sam: Him flying.
Orion: I cast invisibility on you, that's when everything happens. (all laugh)
Marisha: Just falls from the air.
Liam: So are we floating above?
Matt: You guys are currently floating about 100 to 150 feet above the war camp, you do not appear to have been noticed yet.
Travis: Get down there and wing it.
Sam: Should we land on the roof? Or do we land right outside the barracks door? What do we do?
Ashley: Roof, roof, roof.
Sam: You guys wanna stay up and we'll go down?
Travis: You go! Yes.
Sam: Yeah?
Travis: Yes!
Marisha: We can start on the roof, that way that gives us time.
Liam: But I can't go invisible while you're flying.
Travis: Who needs you to be invisible? You're a stealthy bastard.
Orion: We land on the roof, we get in there, I cast Invisibility on you, and then you go do your thing.
Liam: We're running the risk of as we come down on Duergar, going (groans).
Orion: We would risk that anyway, either way.
Sam: I'm so scared right now. (all laugh)
Travis: Why don't we land on the roof and we all lay flat, except for the people that are going in, and you cast Invisibility.
Sam: This is the exact conversation they had when they were about to go kill Osama. (all laugh)
Orion: Wait, I have an idea.
Travis: Oh God.
Orion: Is there enough weight for me get on the carpet at this point?
Ashley: This is fucking stressful.
Matt: You can certainly try. There was weight, but you're not aware of how much was on it.
Orion: Yes I do, it's 1000 pounds.
Matt: You don't know how much weight is on there, total.
Orion: Everybody, how much do you weigh?
Sam: Don't ask a woman that!
Orion: I'm sorry, Your Highness, but I need to know. The idea is if, I can step off on the carpet, and hang with you guys, then Grog you can float down to the whatchamacallit, and take Vax here, then I can, oh shit, I need to be near you to cast it, damn it! (all laugh)
Marisha: Let's just land on the roof.
Ashley: Let's land on the roof.
Liam: We're gonna go in, we're gonna hit the roof, you turn me invisible, he turns him invisible, you guys light up the night, and we just do it, we just gotta go.
Ashley: We're lighting up now?
Sam: You light up on the roof? Let's look for access first. Don't light up 'til we give the go aside.
Ashley: We're still not safe stealthy.
Orion: We need to wait before we light up.
Liam: If anyone takes notice, then turn off the lights.
Sam: By the way--
Taliesin: Do not light up until you see the black or greens of their eyes.
Sam: By the way, Clarota-- Clarota you have definitely picked the right people to assist you.
Matt: There's no verbal response, but you do just emotionally sense a slight hint of regret. (all laugh)
Matt: Emanating from the mind flayer.
Sam: We got this! All right, let's go land on the roof.
Liam: All right, let's do it.
Matt: You guys descend.
Orion: Down, down.
Matt: Eagle flies down, you both, (wind rushing), as part of the landing, everyone make a secondary stealth check.
Taliesin: We still have that plus 10?
Marisha: We still have that plus 10?
Matt: You still have the spell.
Orion: Oh yes!
Marisha: Oh, that was cocked.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Oh, no!
Taliesin: You're a terrible person.
Sam: 30.
Orion: 20.
Marisha: I'm like those boobies, that crash land when they fall.
Matt: You rolled at disadvantage?
Marisha: Well, I rolled a one.
Matt: Okay. Two failures.
Taliesin: That's a 15, 29.
Travis: 23.
Ashley: 21.
Liam: 28.
Matt: Pass Without A Trace is the saving grace. A bit of a harsh landing, from your perspective, but thankfully you have two small gnomes to break your fall.
Ashley: (groan)
Sam: (groan)
Matt: You drag them a little bit across the stonework on the top. It's not stonework, actually. Most of this whole thing, is stonework, it looks like the roof of this is made of like a thick scavenged wood. Whether it was taken from the surface or from the mines itself, it is just wooden planks that are all keeping--
Ashley: Let's go in through the roof.
Taliesin: It's reclaimed, it's very nice.
Liam: If that thing sees us, though, it could be game over. I still think we should stick to the plan of blinding it.
Orion: Yeah, do it.
Sam: So some of us need to go inside.
Liam: You and I.
Travis: Yeah, the two go inside, and if shit goes down, we light it up.
Liam: I will fucking yell into my earring if shit goes down, and you guys gotta pray for me.
Travis: Go find shit!
Sam: We look around for any roof access.
Travis: Come on, Chip 'n' Dale.
Matt: Looking around, there is no roof entrance. It looks like it is purely a functional roof for any weathering, rocks, you do see there are a few small rocks and pieces of cavern that may have plummeted here.
Sam: No chimneys.
Matt: No chimneys, no nothing, there doesn't appear to be a fireplace, or any sort of interior like that. Glancing over the sides, you can see that on the floor-- You can't really tell if there's two floors or not, it looks tall enough to have two floors, but you don't see a set of windows or anything that belies that to you. May just be a really tall single floor. But there are a couple of small window openings, one on each side of-- [static]
Sam: We're gonna go--
Liam: Tiberius, could you do me a favor of making me disappear?
Orion: Yes, when I do this, though, it's going to be very cool. (all laugh)
Liam: Holy shit, where are my hands?
Orion: Right?
Matt: You immediately disappear from view. You currently, visually do not exist.
Marisha: And you still have my buff.
Travis: We're like, flat on the roof, right?
Matt: You guys are all on the roof now, you're fine. Your Fly spell vanishes, you feel your weight return to you for a second. For a split moment you're a little sad, 'cause you were having fun.
Travis: Oh. (all laugh)
Travis: I was a dancer.
Sam: We can see the window, we pick one of the sides, I don't know, west side.
Matt: West side!
Sam: Is it a single pane? Is it an openable window?
Matt: As you glance over, it is just an opening. There is no glass. There is nothing blocking the way. It is about roughly big enough to fit a normal-sized half-elf or human.
Liam: I take Scanlan by the scruff, and swing him down.
Sam: Oh, I turn invisible.
Matt: As you grab him and you're bringing him down, you cast Invisibility on yourself, you both vanish now, all the rest of you are kind of holding your breath, hoping that now that you don't know what's happening, it's gonna go well.
Liam: I'm scaling in after him.
Liam: Go ahead and just make an acrobatics check.
Sam: Don't roll a one, please don't drop me.
Liam: 18.
Matt: All right, yeah, you're good. You gingerly scale down the wall, the stones thankfully are just haphazardly put together, where there's enough grip space for you to catch on.
Sam: I have a climbing kit! (all laugh)
Liam: We're in, we're in.
Matt: Little late for that, but okay. (all laugh)
Matt: You lower him down, you bring him inside, you step down through the opening, into the center of the hallway.
Sam: We can't talk to each other.
Travis: Yes we get a map, finally!
Sam: We can't signal each other, and we don't know where each other is. I hold his hand. (all laugh)
Liam: We're holding hands, I'm leaning way down on the side.
Travis: 'Course you are.
Liam: Sam and I have done this before.
Orion: I use my earring.
Sam: I'm not gonna talk back to you, so whatever you say.
Orion: Just to remind you of how these particular things work, I'm not actually talking right now. So you can just talk to each other through the rings.
Matt: As the two of you step into this room, you look about you, and there are some ramshackle, makeshift beds in the room. Five to be exact, from right to left. This appears to be one portion of a barracks-type sleeping arrangement. Beds are empty, they're kind of tossed, they're not like well-kept or anything. There's sheets kind of tossed about, and it smells awful in here, but it--
Liam: First, I just heard Tiberius' voice in my head. So I'm going to test it out and think. Scanlan, can you hear me?
Sam: Can I hear him?
Matt: From?
Liam: I heard Tiberius whispering about.
Sam: From thoughts only, can I hear him?
Matt: No.
Liam: I tug on his hand to keep going into the barracks.
Sam: I notice that his hand is weirdly cold and sweaty.
Matt: Yeah, not weirdly.
Liam: You just lean to live with the stage fright, you never move past it. Should we pause right now?
Marisha: You didn't bring your stuff?
Laura: I didn't have it!
Orion: Come on in!
Liam: Look, my sister's here.
Laura: Hello!
Liam: We'll make it work. We'll bring you up to speed later, you're on the roof of Osama Bin Laden's house. (all laugh)
Liam: So question for the DM, I'm invisible. Do I need to stealth, do I stealth?
Matt: There's still a stealth check 'cause you're invisible, but noise is still a factor. You just have advantage on your stealth check.
Liam: So, I think we should probably stealth. And start moving in.
Sam: Yeah, that's, we tug each other.
Matt: Beyond being invisible, you guys make your stealth check.
Sam: I mean, I'm invisible, and I rolled a five.
Matt: You have an advantage, you roll twice. 'Cause you're both invisible.
Sam: 13.
Liam: 20.
Matt: All right. You both feel you're stealthed, there is one opening into a hallway here.
Liam: We have, does anyone have a laser light?
Travis: Yep.
Liam: All right.
Travis: Squeeze it together. Press the little button.
Liam: Squeeze it together? Ah, there we go. Okay so we're going to go down here.
Matt: Down to this one. As you guys step out, you can see immediately there are two duergar guards right by a door that leads to a central chamber.
Liam: So we're gonna go this way.
Matt: All right. Immediately you see--
Travis: I like how you guys have different-colored lightsabers.
Matt: Two more Duergar guards.
Travis: (lightsaber noises)
Liam: All right, I'm inching up, I'm pulling Scanlan behind me, but I'm inching up to this door, just peeking through, seeing what I can see.
Matt: Okay, looking inside, you can see these small symbols, basically just red stone, the glow stone, that lights the underground caverns here and in a large portion of Kraghammer, are just embedded in the wall in a small sconce. Peering through here, you see one against the wall, you also see along the edges here, what looks to be racks of spears and pikes and hammers and various war accoutrements of weapons, just hanging, and there's a set of armor, over a small, wooden arrangement, the armor itself is just being stored there. This looks to be like a fast-grab armory.
Liam: Okay. I pull Scanlan by the hand, and we enter into this room.
Sam: This is so romantic.
Liam: It's just like the day we met, Sam.
Matt: You guys enter.
Liam: Quietly walking this way. We're past the door, that looks like the front door.
Matt: It is the front door, it is currently closed, though.
Liam: We're gonna keep going this way.
Sam: Oh man, we're doing-- we're flanking!
Matt: Just come out this way. There is one duergar here. There doesn't appear to be a doorway or entrance to the central chamber on this side of the hallway.
Sam: That's pretty good.
Liam: I still have the pitch in a bucket. The shit in a bucket in my hand, by the way.
Sam: We can take these guys, I'm not worried about that.
Liam: But we'd make noise. How far apart are the two duergar standing in that door?
Matt: They're about five feet apart, just enough space, like one is on each side of the doorway.
Liam: Okay.
Sam: Wait. What are those red things right there?
Matt: Those are the small sconces with the glow stone, the red stone that lights the--
Sam: So we're trying to get there.
Orion: -- with Greater Invisibility, so you can attack, and you'll still be invisible.
Liam: I pull a gold coin out of my pocket, and throw it in this corner.
Sam: This is straight up Metal Gear. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and just make a general dexterity check.
Liam: And because of Keyleth, I have advantage, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Orion: Sure do.
Liam: So this is, what is this?
Matt: Just a dexterity modifier.
Liam: So that's a 17.
Matt: All right, you-- (coin ringing) Ringing sound, both of the duergar kinda look over. They look at each other. Grunt for a second. This one nods her head and begins walking over to inspect it, this one stays at its post.
Marisha: (Metal Gear voice) Must have been my imagination. (all laugh)
Liam: I pull Scanlan behind me, and tiptoe right behind this asshole.
Travis: Do it! Put it in him!
Liam: And take out my vorpal blade. And reach out and grab him by the hair and stick it in the back of his neck.
Sam: You got my dice.
Matt: All right, so, as you reach up, you grasp the back of this really nasty, wiry, thick duergar hair--
Liam: I'm so tense right now.
Matt: You yank the head back, and take the base of the blade, go ahead and make an attack roll. It's a surprise roll, so you have an advantage on the attack.
Liam: Okay, good.
Matt: I believe you have a bonus too, if you get the attack.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: Sneak attack?
Liam: Well, I get-- Yes, I get advantage, but you can't triple up on advantage I believe? (loud bang offscreen)
Sam: What was that?
Matt: That was to freak you out. All right, so just double-checking here as part of your ability.
Sam: Remember every 50 subscribers gets a free giveaway.
Orion: Subscribe now, kids.
Ashley: What is that smile?
Matt: If you score it, and the creature is surprised, it is a critical hit, that's the other thing I was going to mention.
Liam: Thank you. So this isn't a dexterity check, this is an attack.
Matt: This is an attack.
Liam: Okay. So that's a 26.
Matt: That is going to hit, and that is a critical hit. Go ahead and roll damage with Sneak Attack.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Laura: Die die die.
Liam: I'm sweating. Okay, that's two plus seven is nine. That's nine, that's just that part. Six. Seven. Nine. 14. And 19. Which is, what's doubled, the Sneak Attack damage?
Matt: The Sneak Attack damage and the dice damage.
Matt: And the dice damage, 19 plus, is 26, 52.
Marisha: Oh!
Taliesin: Whoa!
Matt: As you pull the head back, you can hear a slight, a slight (gurgles) is about as much noise as can make it out before the blade just, right out the front of its throat, blocking any passage of the air. As you hold it, you twist the blade, it goes limp in your hand, but you catch it and keep holding it there, so it doesn't make any noise. You're now clutching a dead duergar.
Sam: Easy, easy.
Ashley: (shushes) Night-night.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Travis: Lean him up against the wall! Like he's standing there.
Liam: Just had a thought, I'm going to sit him back against the wall, and let him slide against it, and grab Scanlan, and into the room.
Matt: Into this room?
Marisha: There's Scanlan.
Taliesin: He's still standing up, kind of.
Laura: Why is he leading Scanlan, what's happening?
Liam: (shushes)
Sam: While I'm invisible, I look around for traps. I'm just gonna see if there's any trap doors.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: Not great?
Liam: I got a 28.
Sam: Nine.
Matt: You notice no traps. What you do notice, though, is there a giant kind of war room table, at the top of this raised platform. It's about six feet up, and there's a stairway that leads up to it. You see at the table. One of the illithid mind flayers. The armored general that you saw before. And there are two other duergar currently at the table.
Travis: Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Ashley: Stay invisible.
Sam: We can't communicate.
Travis: You guys have got seconds until that other guard comes back.
Liam: We can't talk.
Matt: You hear footsteps behind you.
Liam: I put the bucket of shit into Scanlan's hands.
Laura: What are you doing?
Liam: Give him a little nudge, a gentle little nudge.
Sam: I step forward into the room, and I hurl it at the fucker's face. The mind controllers.
Liam: And I'm rolling behind him at the same time. Behind the illithid, ready to go.
Matt: So I'll say you go up here as well?
Liam: Oh yeah, behind him, behind him.
Laura: What is happening?
Matt: Make a stealth check, both of you.
Travis: Oh God, oh God. Oh God, over extended.
Sam: Wait, do we get the plus ten to stealth?
Matt: No.
Liam: Plus advantage, oh thank christ.
Sam: 19.
Liam: Using Scanlan's advantage, so 16, 29. (sighs)
Matt: Okay. You slink up behind, seemingly unnoticed. There's a slight twitch to the mind flayer's head, for a second, as you go ahead, and take a big ol'--
Sam: Bucket of shit!
Matt: And fling it. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and make an attack roll. It would be, you're not proficient with goblin shit buckets, unfortunately, so go ahead and roll a d20, and add your dexterity.
Orion: (groans)
Sam: My dexterity?
Matt: Dexterity or strength, whichever's higher, strength higher?
Sam: No, no, strength is not higher for me. Oh, it is higher! So 19.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Oh my God.
Matt: You fling it as the Invisibility spell wears off of you as part of the attack, you fling the bucket. A spray of thick, green, goblin fecal matter goes streaking through the air as the illithid turns, its eyes wide, to see you suddenly appear, and then suddenly see this entire batch of thick goblin shit just (splashes) across its face. Suddenly you see his tentacles writhing, as it screams, all of you hear in your head a scream.
Liam: I'm stabbing, I'm stabbing!
Orion: I cast Stoneskin immediately.
Matt: As this happens, you cast Stoneskin, you go in for the blade, and you hear a counter voice in your mind.
Ashley: Fuck.
Matt: Clarota going, "Now."
Marisha: I cast Light on Grog's head!
Matt: Your head comes to an extremely bright glow, all of you averting your gaze.
Liam: This is stealth, right? Stealth for me?
Matt: No, you're invisible.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Sam: Attack, attack, kill him!
Liam: 29! 29!
Matt: That definitely rolls to hit, you have surprise. Go ahead and roll.
Liam: That's a critical, right? I'm assassinating this mother fucker.
Matt: It's a critical, technically. Yep.
Sam: We're going for the general?
Liam: The illithid can control us all.
Ashley: Should we go in?
Orion: We don't know anything.
Matt: So, roll damage on this.
Liam: Roll my damage.
Orion: We just heard a scream. Oh, we can act on that.
Travis: And I rage.
Matt: Stone skin. Light on his head.
Travis: Rage.
Matt: Going into a rage.
Ashley: Daylight on my shield.
Matt: Daylight on your shield.
Laura: I'm so happy to be here. (all laugh)
Matt: I will say for the purposes of this battle, there is no Trinket here, because Trinket would not have fit across the way to get there.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Didn't you give her an arrow?
Taliesin: Yes, and you have an entrapment arrow now.
Laura: Okay, I get ready for that.
Liam: Okay, DM? 62 into the back of his head.
Taliesin: Oh, shit!
Travis: 62?
Ashley: How?
Liam: Critical hit.
Matt: You take the blade, and as it pierces the back--
Liam: Oh, it's a poison one by the way.
Orion: Damn!
Matt: It pierces the back of its skull, you feel the muscles in its neck tense in reaction to the blade, but the blade slips past. You can see a gout of purplish-black blood begin to spill from its neck, as it instinctually reaches up, and pulls the blade from the back of its head. What's the DC on the poison?
Liam: I have no idea.
Matt: It should be on the blade info.
Liam: Poison dagger.
Taliesin: Fuck. Ah!
Liam: I think it's oh, it's 15.
Taliesin: This was a good plan.
Matt: The poison does not seem to take effect, the body resists it. It is still alive. But it's clutching the back of its neck, as it turns around going (sputters), you can see its blood spurting out of its mouth, and its eyes are now just burning with rage. All the rest of these duergar are now reaching and pulling their weapons out. Everyone roll initiative. (all yell)
Laura: I don't have my stuff with me.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Oh, shit.
Sam: Let's kill some bad guys.
Travis: I don't know what you're doing.
Matt: All right, so. 25 to 20?
Liam: 20. Natural 20.
Matt: But you have no bonuses? You should have your dex bonus too.
Liam: Oh yeah, that's a 25.
Matt: So, I'm gonna say you're probably going in first, buddy.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: All right, 20, 25 to 20, anyone else?
Laura: Oh, I think I got like a 21.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: I got 16 plus--
Matt: Yep, that'd be 21, yeah. All right, so. 19, anyone?
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19, nice.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Gonna wing it.
Matt: 18, anyone?
Travis: 18.
Matt: Nice.
Orion: I got 16.
Marisha: Do you have like a picture, or a file anywhere, saved of your--
Laura: I got jack shit!
Marisha: Of your sheet?
Liam: We snuck into the war camp.
Laura: We're in the war camp?
Liam: We all landed on the top of their main building.
Matt: So, what's your?
Sam: 14.
Orion: I have 16.
Matt: 16, all right, so Tiberius. Scanlan, what was yours?
Ashley: Nine.
Marisha: Also nine.
Ashley: Not to brag.
Travis: Ashley's first two rolls were 20s.
Matt: All right, top of the round is Vax, with initiative.
Liam: I'm just gonna (grunts) in the back of his head some more. I'm still invisible according to Tiberius' Greater Invisibility spell.
Orion: No no no, as soon as I cast Stoneskin, you were attacking, that's why I said this is all going--
Matt: You are now visible, you are not stealthed.
Liam: Stab him in the back of the head. For assassinate, do I get the critical still here, DM?
Matt: No. You've gotten the one hit, it is completely aware of you, it is not a surprise attack.
Liam: So this is a 28.
Matt: It is so aware of you, it has never been more aware of you in its life. (all laugh)
Liam: I just rolled a 28.
Matt: Okay, that definitely hits. Attacking with your off hand?
Liam: Oh, so this is my bonus attack?
Matt: Yeah, you get the one attack, then you get the bonus hand. Which is just dice damage.
Liam: Okay, this is fire. My flame tongue dagger, I got two plus six is eight.
Matt: Eight?
Liam: Eight.
Matt: All right. And your other attack? Are you doing your bonus attack?
Liam: Was that the bonus attack? Or was that my main attack?
Matt: This is your new combat round, that was your main attack.
Liam: That's a nine, and here comes my bonus attack. Okay, 14.
Marisha: Kill him.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Liam: Here comes my keen dagger. Which is an eight.
Matt: Eight damage?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: So the first strike, you swing across with the flame tongue dagger. As it backs up, you put another gash across the front of its neck and chest area. It reels back and is looking at you with angry fury. You feel this coming shake, this horrible force of severe retribution coming to your mind, and as you're bracing for it, you take your other blade, you see its mouth opens up with frustration and anger as its tentacles kinda curl back, and just go in for the grab. You place the blade squarely into that maw, you feel the scraping of its teeth across your knuckles, but it doesn't matter, because whatever anger and light was once in its face, goes dark and dull. (all cheer)
Matt: As immediately it crumples to the ground, lifeless, pull the blade from the maw, mind flayer down. (all cheer)
Marisha: Yeah Vax!
Matt: He was next, but not anymore. As it falls to the ground, all the rest of the duergar immediately have a reaction. We'll get to their turn in a second. Vex, you're up. So you're on the roof, up here right now.
Sam: Gotta get inside first.
Laura: We have to run down in?
Matt: Run down, you're on a wooden roof surface, you heard before there's an entrance here, and an entrance there.
Liam: Windows are swing-down-in-able.
Sam: Unless Grog can just tear through the roof.
Laura: What was your initiative?
Liam: It's wood.
Taliesin: You can hold initiative.
Laura: I guess I'll hold, I'll hold, to see what the hell's happening.
Matt: So you hold on that. It is now this dude's turn, the general. He, unaffected by this, it seems, just angrily leaps on to the table, runs across, (groans), and jumps down towards you. As he does, you see his physical form seems to enlarge. His actual small dwarvish form begins to swell, his muscles tense. He's about the size of a normal person, if not a little bigger right now. He comes at you with this giant black, jagged metal war hammer. (groans) Comes down to swing at you, as he comes down, you see it burst into flame. There's fire now surrounding the head of this war hammer as it arcs toward you.
Sam: What?
Matt: That is going to be a 24 to hit.
Liam: Oh, it hits, but I use Uncanny Dodge to try to swoop out of the way as best I can.
Matt: All righty. You suffer-- That would be... 12 plus six fire damage, so, 18, reduced to nine. You take nine damage from the strike. As it strikes down, it goes for a back swing to attack you a second time. That is going to be a 15 versus AC. This time you just dodge completely out of the way. Derge out of the way.
Marisha: Derge.
Liam: Er mah gerd, I derged. (all laugh)
Matt: Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Just in case, I'm going to push off and wait for Grog. So I'm holding my turn.
Matt: Okay, Grog, your turn.
Travis: Right, so we're on the roof of the thing, right?
Matt: Correct, you are.
Travis: I'm in a rage, I take the pot still on my head, and I pick up my ax, and I draw one gigantic smash through the roof of the building.
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check.
Taliesin: God, yes.
Orion: This is all you're good for.
Marisha: Yes, come on Grog. This is all you're good for.
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Come on.
Sam: 15?
Matt: You bring your ax up, you bring it down on top as hard as you can, go ahead and roll ax damage.
Travis: Is that a d12?
Matt: It's a d12 plus your strength modifier. Plus two 'cause you're raging.
Travis: Do I get advantage on that?
Matt: No.
Travis: Seven.
Laura: Plus two 'cause you're raging.
Travis: Nine.
Matt: Nine damage, okay. As you swing the ax down, slam, it hits the wood. With the sheer weight of you there, and most of you guys conglomerated at that point, the actual roof breaks open and splits, into a small space. You slide down in the process.
Ashley: I jump on to Grog's foot. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. Go ahead, both of you make an acrobatics check.
Ashley: Oh, I wouldn't have had to do it. All right, well, I'm in the building.
Travis: 21.
Matt: Acrobatics check?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Pike? You have disadvantage 'cause you're in plate armor.
Ashley: Six.
Matt: All right, so Grog, you manage to land on your feet. Pike, you actually plummet off and fall off to the side, right there. You are currently prone, and from the fall, which you guys both dropped down, you managed to reduce the damage, but you from the fall, you take eight points of fall damage. You are now flat on your back, the wind knocked out of you for a minute.
Sam: Pike!
Ashley: I'm okay, I'm okay!
Sam: Oh okay, thank God.
Matt: All right. That brings us now, Vex and Percy are the same.
Taliesin: You first? Or should I go first?
Laura: Let's go down at the same time.
Taliesin: We'll go, we both jump down at the same time.
Matt: Both jump down, go ahead and make your acrobatics checks, guys.
Taliesin: 20.
Laura: Oh, I rolled really bad.
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: I rolled a two, but I add it to my acrobatics.
Matt: Yes, which is?
Sam: Which you don't know.
Laura: Which is like, I bet.
Matt: Your acrobatics, as you're proficient in it, and you have plus five dex, so that would bring it to 11?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Or no, 12.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Did you bring any Wheaton power from the other room? (all laugh)
Matt: You just barely land on your feet, you do take fall damage, but you don't fall prone. You take eight points of fall damage. Percy, you manage to land fine, without any damage, on your feet. On the ground, both of you kind of three-point landing. Avengers style.
Taliesin: Do I have time to get a shot off?
Matt: You do, that was your movement. So what's the deal?
Taliesin: Wow, I'm taking a second, and I see that Vax is getting attacked, and I'm gonna just take a shot at the-- The guy with the hammer. The biggest thing I see.
Matt: Do you have your glasses or goggles on?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's right, I have a helmet. So yeah, I'm wearing the helmet. I'm cool with that.
Matt: So go for it.
Liam: Do it, Starlord.
Taliesin: Ah! A natural 20. (all cheer)
Matt: Against the general, or one of the duergar?
Taliesin: The general.
Liam: The guy on the table attacking me.
Matt: Yeah, you can just barely see him, the stairway is up there.
Taliesin: Doesn't matter, as long as I have-- partial cover, it don't matter.
Matt: Right, I know, and he does have, he has three-quarters cover because of the distance, but you natural 20'd, so it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: I can ignore it, I ignore three-quarters cover.
Matt: You do, because--
Taliesin: I'm awesome.
Matt: Yep. (all laugh)
Taliesin: So that's double 1d-- I should have gotten some bonuses on that, I'm an idiot. Plus five. It's just double dice damage?
Matt: Double dice damage, then add your modifier.
Marisha: Woo!
Taliesin: That's 19 points of damage.
Matt: To the general, nice.
Marisha: Nice.
Matt: (explosion) He gets shot in the back of the shoulderplate, you hear it ricochet and a little bit of blood begins to streak off the back of his head. He looks over his shoulder with an angry grunt, you can see now this dwarf, who's still swelling in size. It looks, (growls), an angry nostril flare. You, have your bow ready?
Laura: I wanna do Lightning Arrow on the guy attacking my brother.
Matt: That guy there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll to attack.
Laura: Ugh, I don't think I hit.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: I had rolled a four.
Matt: A four, you had a plus 11 to hit, it's going to be a 15, unfortunately you miss. The arrow streaks past. Yeah, the arrow just ended up striking the wall back here and (explosion) arcs lightning throughout the wall, unfortunately does not--
Laura: I Hunter's Mark him anyway, just for future stuff.
Matt: You used your--
Laura: That was a bon--
Matt: You used your bonus action to cast Lightning Arrow.
Laura: Oh! So I get a regular attack now?
Matt: Well, that was part of your regular attack, like your next arrow you fired.
Laura: I get it. (all laugh)
Taliesin: You're going off-book, this is cool.
Matt: I think, let me double-check real fast, just to be sure. Because I don't wanna screw you out of a cool turn.
Laura: That is mine!
Matt: Next time bring your sheet.
Laura: I'm sorry.
Matt: That's okay. Yeah that's a bonus action to cast lightning, into your next arrow you fire, however, you do have two attacks. So you can shoot a second time. It just isn't affected by Lightning Arrow.
Laura: I roll 14.
Matt: That does hit, go ahead and roll damage there's 1d10, plus--
Laura: I think it was 1d8, actually.
Matt: Oh, for the longbow? Okay, 1d8 plus five for your dex, and then plus two for the bow. Plus seven.
Laura: Ten.
Matt: Ten damage, all right. So first arrow just streaks off, hits the wall. As he's kind of staring at Percy, he looks towards you, and as he does, the second arrow sticks into the plate, he kinda looks at it. (grunts) Just snaps it off in the armor. Grabbing his two-handed sword, or sorry, the war hammer in the other hand. Minis, it's confusing. All right, that ends your turn. Grog, the light that is beaming from your helmet currently right now is filling up the room, and it is extremely bright, most of you guys can handle it. You see all the duergar at the table like (groans), bunch of duergar come running in as well, as they run in, they're having to shield their eyes, but it's actually physically hurting them to be in that room right now. They're like (groans). Keeping it at bay, this one attempts to run in, this one's kind of making its way over. These guys here, this one's gonna go ahead and run here, this one's gonna go ahead and come to Grog. These two are gonna come up behind.
Sam: Is that guy the general?
Matt: That guy's the general, yes. This one's gonna come up behind to you. All right, they have disadvantage on their attacks.
Orion: Nice.
Matt: Because of the light. (all cheer)
Travis: 'Cause I'm so bright.
Matt: Attack against you.
Marisha: You're the brightest tool in the shed today.
Matt: That is a 17 versus AC. You just dodge out of the way. Next one, its war pick against you, Grog.
Ashley: Get skinny, get skinny.
Matt: That is 20 versus AC?
Travis: That hits.
Matt: That hits, all right. You take eight points of damage as it slams you with its war pick in the chest, you can feel it kind of gets about a half an inch of depth into it, but you just kind of shrug it off, and flex your muscles and it pops it out of your torso.
Travis: That's cute.
Matt: The two against you. That'll be a 19 versus AC.
Laura: Oh, yeah, that hits for sure.
Matt: And a 17 versus AC.
Laura: That-- hits.
Matt: All right, so you take two hits. That's 11 damage. And 13 damage as both of them start whaling you from behind with war picks.
Liam: Vex'ahlia! I yell.
Laura: 13 and what?
Matt: All right. Next up is the one that's attacking you.
Sam: Scanlan.
Matt: Scanlan, that's going to be, at a disadvantage, a 15 versus armor class.
Sam: 14.
Matt: 14? That still strikes you. You take eight points of damage from the war pick. Slamming you over the shoulder.
Sam: (yells out) Ah, I'm so awesome, Pike! (all laugh)
Matt: That ends their go, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: I'm still on the roof, right?
Matt: You're still on the roof, yes.
Orion: What can I see, like if I go down, what can I see?
Matt: You look through the hole, and you can see pretty much the entire battlefield. You're just up here looking down through it.
Orion: Oh, wonderful.
Matt: You're currently the only one still up there.
Orion: Yes, I think I'll stay right here, thank you very much. And how tall is the roof? How high is it? 15 feet?
Matt: It's about 25 feet up?
Orion: Okay, wonderful, wonderful. So, let me see here. This is fun.
Matt: You are technically, because I can do it.
Taliesin: Gonna use one of the little lifties, aren't you?
Matt: I am.
Marisha: Finally.
Liam: Bring the fire, Tiberus.
Sam: Oh. Toys.
Marisha: Now he's getting out toys.
Taliesin: Aw yeah.
Sam: Come on, do something.
Orion: I'm waiting for him to do something, 'cause it's so cool.
Marisha: I got him this for Christmas two years ago, and he's finally using it.
Matt: You are up here right now.
Orion: Awesome.
Travis: Three-dimensional fighting.
Liam: Toys, toys.
Matt: Is that visible?
Taliesin: Yeah. Sweet D&D rave.
Orion: Okay. I'm going to-- I see the two guards behind Vex, right? Is that what's going on?
Matt: Yep, right there.
Orion: And then the one duergar in front of Grog? Is that what's going on, too?
Matt: Yep, right there. Great, I will cast Grand Columns under all three of those dudes, and pin 'em. Right up against the roof. With my columns.
Liam: Clever girl.
Matt: The?
Orion: Pillars, yes.
Matt: But those pillars only go 15 feet up.
Orion: No, they go up to 25.
Matt: 25? Oh nice.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: That's why I always ask that question. It does 66 bludgeoning damage when it's pinned.
Ashley: Bye bye.
Sam: If they don't make their save.
Matt: All right, so. Go ahead and what is your DC on that? Your spell DC?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17, all right. All right, the heartiness of the duergar resilience gives them advantage on saves against spells. They all make their saves.
Sam: What?
Matt: But they are still up on these platforms now, raised above. So what is-- Does it do any damage if they make their saves?
Orion: (reading)
Sam: Come on iPhone, come on iphone!
Marisha: You're supposed to know everything!
Sam: iPhone five! This is the Fifth Edition.
Orion: Why doesn't it say? I guess it doesn't. It doesn't say.
Matt: So they are currently--
Sam: What is this madness?
Taliesin: Oh, you're crazy.
Orion: Oh, wait a minute, no. You make this call. If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 66 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a strength or dexterity check against the spell save DC. On a success they are no longer restrained, and must either move off the pole, or fall off of it. So they still, it still happens, but they're not pinned by it. Got you, okay. So go ahead and roll damage for all of them.
Marisha: Woo!
Matt: Good to know. (sings) New spells that just got released.
Liam: There's magic in the dwarves.
Sam: Magic in them.
Liam: The duergar.
Marisha: ♫ A whole new spell
Taliesin: ♫ A fantastic way to die
Marisha: ♫ No one can tell us no
Orion: 27 damage.
Marisha: ♫ Except for Matt (all laugh)
Matt: All three of the duergar are crushed.
Sam: To death?
Matt: Against the ceiling.
Orion: I did 27 damage to each one.
Travis: Nice!
Matt: Splat, splat, splat, they're all slammed into the ceiling, you can see limp dwarf arms and legs now dangling out of the stone pillars that are now permanently embedding them into the ceiling.
Liam: Yeah, son.
Sam: Crazy room!
Orion: I go like this, hah! I use two of my sorcerer points, and I cast Quicken Spell, and I look at the general, and I-- Because of my books I've been tampering with, I cast Blight on his eyes. Okay. 'Cause I wanna. (all laugh)
Matt: What's the-- the DC is 17, you said?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: All right, natural 20. So he makes his save. (all groan)
Orion: He takes 8d8 damage, and if he saves, he takes half the damage.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: 10, 15.
Liam: They were all eights, right?
Marisha: Well, he does all of them and then divides.
Sam: But you said half.
Marisha: He rolls all of them and then divides.
Sam: I see.
Orion: 15 plus, what is that, ten, 14.
Marisha: Your first one was--
Orion: 29?
Matt: So we'll say a solid 14 points of damage. All right, gotcha. No other effect, just the damage from Blight, right?
Orion: Yeah, because he made his save.
Matt: All right, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Oh, okay. I'm going to, (groans). God there's so few people to kill now. (all laugh)
Sam: You did it all, is it just us and the general?
Laura: Wait, that guy behind you though.
Matt: Just you guys, the general. There's a guy right behind you. Those guys got slammed.
Sam: Okay, I'm gonna cast Dominate Person on the general.
Travis: (laughs) What does that do?
Orion: Oh shit.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: He's a power top.
Matt: With advantage, he rolled a one and a two, on the saving throw. (all cheer)
Matt: That's ridiculous, okay.
Sam: I'm going to Dominate him and inform him, I can give him a command, right? Yes.
Orion: You can make him do whatever.
Sam: I'm going to tell him to stand down, and tell all of his allies to stand down.
Matt: All right. He turns around. Gives you a look, a strange look, he goes. "Men, all of you, drop your weapons! Now. We are surrendering to our new infiltrators." He throws his war hammer to the ground. The rest of them all kind of look around. Go ahead and, I'm gonna have you make intimidation check on his behalf.
Sam: Okay, on his behalf?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Do I add mine?
Matt: No, I'm just considering that, so you rolled 11?
Sam: 11. (sings along with the music)
Matt: The three other duergar look confused, look at the dead mind flayer, look at their general telling them to surrender, and they all kinda throw their weapons to the ground, and stand there with their arms to the side, kind of waiting for what's gonna happen next. As you finish that, Clarota slowly drifts down.
Sam: Oh yeah, Clarota, thanks for all the fucking help. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh no. This is gonna be bad.
Matt: Clarota just kinda looks around. Says, you hear this voice in your mind go, "I had my doubts, but, well done."
Orion: Thank you.
Matt: So. That ends that turn. Scanlan, do you want to move at all? Are you going to stay where you are?
Sam: I'm gonna stay where, well, I'm gonna move just a couple feet away from the guy right behind me, and I'm going to, as my bonus action, might as well give Grog some dice. And also just tell everyone, remember, let's not kill the general, we need him for information.
Liam: Probably if anyone tries to hit him, he'll snap out of it, so.
Sam: That's it. I also take a little poo in my pants.
Taliesin: Small kilo.
Sam: This is still-- A battle? Even though. No combatants?
Matt: I mean, if you guys are deciding not to fight anymore, what's your plan?
Marisha: I-- Come on down and I say, good work guys. That was cool, that was great.
Sam: He's under my spell.
Laura: Perhaps we should tie him up.
Marisha: That's what I was gonna say, I cast Grasping Vine and I just take a vine and I tie his hands behind his back. And kind of grapple him.
Sam: So that'll break the spell.
Marisha: Well no, I'm not damaging him, I'm just--
Liam: Hugging him.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Hugging him with vines.
Taliesin: Vine hugs.
Matt: As this is happening, you guys feel a familiar tremble.
Sam: Oh no. Be quiet.
Matt: In the ground.
Liam: DM is out of his mind.
Matt: Everyone make a stealth check. (all laugh)
Marisha: Damn it.
Orion: Oh, that's a 20.
Sam: That is a 20.
Marisha: (whimpers) This is the second time I rolled a one on my stealth check.
Taliesin: Wow.
Marisha: I'm not stealthy today.
Ashley: 17.
Liam: 18.
Laura: 19.
Travis: 14.
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: Pretty good overall.
Orion: Two.
Sam: 22.
Matt: All right. There is the rumble, gets louder and louder, and you can see the duergar looking around nervously. The rumbling kind of fades for a second. And with a cacophonous cracking sound, the stone floor beneath you splits open.
Sam: No!
Matt: Right here.
Liam: (groans)
Matt: Percy, make an acrobatics check and try to avoid whatever is coming through.
Sam: Whatever? It's a dragon!
Taliesin: 18.
Liam: It's a worm.
Matt: All right, you manage to just pull out of the way. As a large--
Laura: What the fuck is that?
Marisha: What is that?
Matt: A large armored four-legged creature comes bursting out of the ground around you.
Orion: Oh great, it's a rock butthole. (all laugh)
Matt: Lets out this horrible screeching growl, has this kind of hungry look in its eyes.
Marisha: Can I reactionary real quick, take my Grasping Vine and just lift him and kind of put him in the corner to keep the general safe?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Orion: Is he rooted?
Matt: He is currently-- Is considered grappled.
Liam: I have a question.
Marisha: I was just trying to keep him safe.
Liam: Can we take a potty break before?
Sam: A potty break? No breaks tonight!
Liam: No breaks?
Marisha: No breaks.
Matt: We're pushing through. You need a bottle.
Marisha: Exercise your kegels.
Matt: If you really need to go, you can. When it's not your turn.
Liam: No, I'm fine.
Sam: Just pee on Ashley, it's okay.
Crew: Suck it up, man.
Matt: As this entity comes burrowing up from underneath the ground, it immediately makes a strike against--
Sam: Guys, this is so exciting. And Laura has no idea what's going on.
Laura: No clue, good times.
Matt: This is gonna be a bite attack against you, Percy. That is, all right, 24 versus armor class.
Travis: Shit, bite is at 24.
Taliesin: Yeah, that-- That hits.
Matt: As you reactively attempt to move out of the way, this creature comes tearing out of the ground. Gets its bearings, rears back, and this giant, toothy maw comes clamping down onto your entire torso. You suffer 36 points of piercing damage.
Sam: Oh!
Taliesin: The fuck?
Marisha: 36?
Matt: 36 points of piercing damage. That's going to end its turn.
Marisha: Shit.
Matt: Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay, well.
Taliesin: That hurt.
Ashley: I'm still prone?
Matt: You are prone, you can use your movement to get back up.
Ashley: Okay, I use my movement to get back up. Do I also get an attack for doing that?
Matt: You still have your action, and your bonus action, it's just your move.
Ashley: Okay. I will use Guiding Bolt, and I'm gonna shoot that thing.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Sam: That's my girlfriend.
Travis: Come on, Pike.
Marisha: Does this guy appear to be messed up by the Daylight at all?
Ashley: Okay. Do I add anything?
Matt: You add your spell attack modifier, it's on your spell sheet. So the top of your spell sheet.
Ashley: Sorry guys. Oh sweet, okay, so. That would be 25.
Matt: That definitely hits. So, Guiding Bolt, what does that do?
Ashley: So I roll, where'd it go, I roll 4d6. I roll 4d6.
Matt: 4d6, go ahead and do that.
Ashley: Yes. 16.
Matt: 16, all right. So you reach back, clutching your holy symbol. You get back off the ground, release your hand as this suddenly flaring blast of divine energy comes cascading out of the front of your palm, blasting into the side of the face, nearly searing one of the eyes of the creature. It rears back, brings one leg up instinctually, (growls) slams the ground in the process-- How you doing? That's disadvantage to your next attack.
Liam: Aw!
Ashley: Wait, what are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 38.
Matt: It lands, puts its foot back on the ground, and kinda gears its attention towards you. It's angling around the room for what should be its next meal. Anything else you wanna do?
Ashley: Can I give him a healing potion? Can I heal him?
Matt: He's too far away. You could use your bonus action if you wanna use Healing Word.
Ashley: Okay, I'll use Healing Word.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll that for him. While you're doing that, brings us-- So Clarota now gets its action.
Marisha: Yeah, Clarota!
Matt: Clarota now looks wide-eyed, seeing this happen. You hear a slight voice in the back of your head go, "This is complicating." As it rears back, you hear the slight echoing, screeching sound, that just manages to skirt the outside of your mental capacity. You feel like if you were any closer, or if it was directed towards you, it would be a horrible ringing pain in your head. You're just peripheral to it. It makes its attack. Unfortunately, the exterior, the bulette, and/or its mind shielding is too strong, it seems to have no effect on the creature.
Sam: Damn it! Clarota, worthless!
Matt: A bulette, is the entity. That ends its turn, top of the round, Vax.
Liam: Okay, I think, where's the laser? Here it is. It looks like I have just enough squares to go one two three. Who's this right here?
Matt: That's a duergar. Weapon on the ground, not armed right now.
Liam: Can I get to here on a turn? I can't tell.
Matt: What's your movement?
Liam: It's 30 feet. I'll use my bonus action to click my haste boots together.
Matt: Okay, then you can definitely do that.
Liam: Okay, and since Percy is right up against it, I'm able to deal Sneak Attack damage, because there's another one of its foes.
Matt: Exactly, yes. You don't get an advantage on the attack, but if you attack, you do it.
Liam: So I'm gonna try to strike him in his underbelly.
Matt: All right. Even the underbelly itself is heavily armored, you have to kind of gauge quickly where the plate is.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20? 20 hits.
Matt: Go ahead and roll with your Sneak Attack damage.
Marisha: So 20 hits?
Liam: Oh, and it was-- Never mind. So three. There we go. 22.
Matt: 22 damage? All righty. Got it. Cool, that brings us to-- The general is going to attempt to make a saving throw.
Sam: Shit. He can do that?
Matt: Every time he gets a turn round, he gets a chance to break out of the-- And he does.
Sam: Oh, he broke out?
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Shrugs off the mental influence of the Dominate spell. However, he is not currently armed. He uses his movement, or action to pick up the war hammer. Fury and anger is in his eyes.
Marisha: He's still grappled.
Sam: No no, he just broke out, right?
Marisha: Oh, from the grapple, too?
Matt: Yeah, he used his whole turn to break out of the grapple and grab its weapon, that's all he can do.
Sam: Where is he?
Matt: Right there.
Liam: To fight the bulette? Or to--
Matt: You have no idea.
Liam: Oh, we don't know, oh. He could just be reacting to the bulette.
Matt: The flames on the hammer are out too. But it picks up the war hammer, it's cold black steel currently.
Travis: We got our Davy Jones in the room, he'll take care of the dwarves.
Matt: That brings us to... Grog.
Travis: (groans) Kitty! I would like to go into a frenzied rage, and charge at Clifford the big red dog. (all alguH)
Matt: You leap off the higher platofrm, come rushing out with your ax in the air, as you come down using the full weight of your body behind the attack, go ahead and roll your three attacks.
Travis: All right, I have nine, eight, 17.
Sam: You have one dice from me. I've inspired you.
Travis: Oh.
Sam: (singing) Grog. Grog.
Travis: Is it a 20 or is it a what?
Matt: You get to add a d8 to an attack roll.
Sam: If you have a shitty attack roll, add a d8 to it, if you have a shitty roll.
Travis: 17.
Orion: Grog, smash right through his plate thingy.
Matt: Barely hits.
Travis: 19.
Matt: Hits, all three attacks hit.
Travis: Yeah, that one hits, 16 plus eight.
Matt: So all three attacks hit, roll damage for three hits. As you come now, just slamming your grey ax, into the side of this armored beast, just over and over again. Cleaving this nice little wide section of its armor on the side.
Liam: Take his fucking head off.
Travis: 14. 21. 21 again.
Ashley: What?
Travis: 22.
Laura: Oh, so. 22, 21, and 14.
Sam: Whoa.
Laura: I was doing his math. (all laugh)
Matt: 21, 22, and 14 you said?
Ashley: 57?
Sam: 57.
Travis: I don't wanna do math and show you all up.
Liam: That's a level nine barbarian.
Matt: So, slam him, you see a portion of its side armor splits, you can see a little bit of that dark red, fleshy interior. You do a significant amount of damage, and leave a nice little weak point in its armor. However, it still doesn't seem to be entirely phased by the damage, it just kinda shrugs at the damage, and kinda glares at you for a second. One of its eyes that was focused on Percy and Keyleth, now looks over at you Jurassic-Park style, with the t-rex up at the side of the vehicle. Vex?
Laura: I back up a little bit. Yeah, like that. And I'm gonna cast Hail of Thorns on him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Sounds nasty.
Laura: Right? I'm gonna shoot like a regular attack.
Matt: So your bonus action to cast Hail of Thorns, and then you attack with the arrow, go for it.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You're adding 11 to it.
Laura: Okay, good, then that'd be 18.
Matt: 18? 18 hits.
Laura: Yes, so I was casting that as a level three spell. I roll 3d-- that means I roll 3d10.
Matt: Against the creature?
Laura: Against 14 which is my spell level thingy.
Travis: 3d10.
Laura: Yeah, 1d10 for damage.
Matt: Yep, go for it.
Laura: That is an eight-sided dice, yay!
Matt: There yougo.
Laura: An eight.
Matt: That'd be 25.
Laura: I get another attack, so I'm gonna do that. Natural 20! (all cheer)
Matt: Nice, all right, go ahead and roll damage, double the dice and add your modifier of seven.
Liam: That arrow just went slow mo.
Laura: Double the dice. 15.
Matt: 15, all right. So what happens here is you pull an arrow out, as you whisper a couple of words under your breath, you see all these thorny spikes being to shoot out the shaft of the arrow. You release it and as it strikes in the front of its face, the arrow actually splinters, sending a bunch of these thorns all over its torso, piercing an inch or two into its armor with each blast of these thorns. It kinda rears back and tries to shake itself off. As it does, you get a little bit of a look as Grog backs away from it, checking to see the wound he left. You take your secondary arrow, aim for the red soft spot, boom, slips right past the armor plating, doing the extra damage on the interior of its physical self. Awesome, that's your turn I believe.
Ashley: Good turn.
Matt: Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay, is my hand still stuck in its mouth? (all laugh)
Taliesin: I would like it to be.
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah, you could've left it there.
Taliesin: Do I have an advantage to hit if my gun is in its mouth? (all laugh)
Matt: You are considered grappled if you leave your hand there. You can remain grappled for advantage on the attack roll.
Taliesin: Done. So I get to roll twice?
Matt: You do.
Marisha: This is a whole new meaning to point-blank.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19, that'll hit.
Taliesin: Okay, I spent some grit on this, and did some interesting modifiers.
Matt: How much grit did you spend?
Taliesin: Two points of grit.
Matt: Okay, this is the--
Taliesin: The Deadshot. And I also took a negative five hit for a plus ten damage to this shot, and I'm using my fire modifier. I'm just being an asshole. (all laugh)
Marisha: That's amazing.
Taliesin: That's... 16 and 20, 35 points of fire damage inside of its mouth.
Matt: So, your hand inside, you pull back and fire, knowing which barrel is next. You hear this dull(muffled explosion) sound, and its eyes kinda pulse for a second, in intense fury and pain, smoke just billows out the sides of its mouth, and its nostrils, and it begins to kind of shake its head, lifting you about a foot off the ground, painfully, but you think it's worth the deal. Well done.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: Aw man.
Matt: I will say that ends your turn.
Liam: Thank you Gary Gygax, wherever you are. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. The duergar, currently seeing the situation, and the change of tone, go and grab their weapons.
Travis: Change of tone. (all laugh)
Travis: Shit got real.
Matt: This duergar is going to move up, back to you, Scanlan, as it sees that you were the one that took over the general.
Sam: Dicks, bring it.
Liam: Dicks.
Matt: This one comes rushing in.
Marisha: Aw, come on.
Liam: Freakin' tank in the room.
Marisha: There's a bigger problem, bro.
Matt: Opportunists, man. It rushes after you, actually.
Liam: ♫ Why can't we be friends
All: ♫ Why can't we be friends
Matt: All right, the attack against you, Scanlan. That is gonna be a 17 versus AC. All right, this one is actually also physically growing in size as it comes towards you.
Sam: It's getting hard. (all laugh)
Matt: You suffer 16 points of damage.
Orion: Such a bummer.
Matt: As the war pick comes slamming into your side. You see it's coming, but you're just not fast enough. It hits you, on impact, it may have cracked a rib, you're not sure. The one that's coming up against you, rolls, that's going to be a 17 versus armor class.
Liam: Fuck you.
Matt: You see it and just duck out of the way, its war pick slams into the stone wall next to you, with a horrible screeching stone sound. High-AC rogue, yo. All right that ends their turn, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: I'm looking in, I'm like, oh, that's no good. I look at where he made the crack in the armor, where is that, is that in the head?
Matt: It's in the head area, right over here.
Orion: Right, awesome. I'm going to kind of motion towards the mind flayer, and give a telepathic wink.
Matt: It is on the ground.
Orion: Yeah.
Sam: Are you flirting with it?
Matt: You make a telepathic wink.
Orion: And I'm going to cast Telekinesis, and I'm going to pry open the metal. I'm not going to target the creature, I'm going to target the armor.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: Interesting thought, okay. See if it-- the 17 is the DC?
Orion: Yes.
Travis: This could be cool.
Matt: All right, it fails. So here's what happens. For the effect of this. It suffers, I'm gonna say it suffers about 2d6 points of damage from the tearing. So go ahead and roll that.
Orion: Six damage.
Matt: So six damage, however, you have effectively reduced its armor class by five.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: In doing so.
Sam: Ooh!
Orion: And I'm going to spend two more sorcery points, and do the spell again. I'm going to do a-- I'm gonna do Firebolt, right in the hole. And I'm going to use my metamagic wand to fire the spell.
Marisha: Fire in the hole!
Matt: All right, go for it!
Sam: He has so many dice, it's crazy.
Orion: Oh, that hits.
Taliesin: Actually, does that crit? Does your 19 crit?
Matt: No. Usually, 20 is only crit, except for, I think he has a bonus ability.
Sam: Critical Role by the way, name of the show. (all laugh)
Matt: It's okay, you're good, and you're a fighter, which means eventually you'll end up with four attacks per round anyway, so you're fine.
Orion: Can't do that.
Taliesin: I'm looking forward to it.
Matt: Damage, what you got? Scanlan, you're on deck, by the way.
Sam: I'm ready.
Orion: I zap him, I zap him for one.
Matt: Okay. (all laugh)
Orion: No, no no no, I empowered it. Full, it takes ten damage. 'Cause I empowered the spell.
Matt: That's correct, so. As you pull down with the ray, it streaks down across the ceiling portion of the building, right into the fleshy, exposed part of its armor, now it looks like it has this giant jagged scar in the side of its head, where you can see muscle and sinew pulsing with each of its movements. You blast into it, you can see this darkened black portion of its interior flesh, it's now charred, slight embers beginning to percolate and burn on the outskirts of the impact. Well done, you gonna stay where you are?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: Scanlan, what you got?
Sam: Okay, I'm going, I know he'll get a hit on me, but I'm gonna run away from the guy behind me, run straight at the general, and just open out my arms in an outstretched big hug, and I'm like, come here big guy, come here! And I give him a big hug, and upon touching him, I cast Banishment on him and send him to another dimension.
Orion: Nice!
Matt: All right. (all laugh)
Matt: As you move away, the duergar is going to attempt to make, as a reaction, to make an attack on you.
Sam: It's okay, it's all cool for Pike.
Matt: That's going to be a 13 versus armor class.
Sam: Does not hit.
Matt: You hear it coming, as you're walking, "buddy!" (all laugh)
Matt: Duck under a war pick.
Matt: With advantage on its saving throw. What's the DC?
Sam: DC?
Matt: The DC on your spell?
Sam: Well, if I'm doing it through my cone, it's 19.
Matt: I will say for this, you do not have it through your cone, because you had your arms open, you didn't specify, however, it still fails it's saving throw. The general, as you reach up, he has his war pick ready. Pulls back its war pick as the flames burst in. (all laugh)
Matt: Then blinks out of existence. (all cheer)
Orion: Nice move.
Ashley: One down, one down.
Sam: Oh, he's gone, oh, where did he go? I don't know.
Matt: How long does it last, by the way?
Sam: It's concentration. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. All right.
Liam: Scanlan Shorthalt, playing Vegas, ladies and gentlemen.
Sam: Do I get a bonus?
Matt: You do get a bonus action.
Sam: Okay, I'm just going to sing a little ditty to Pike, just to give her a little inspiration. I'll just do some pelvic thrusting-- a little (guitar), that's a flute, by the way. (all laugh)
Orion: Super, play that thing.
Matt: His electric flute gives you a d8 inspiration dice, so you can add that to any attack rolls.
Liam: He can do anything with any instrument.
Ashley: Sweet licks on your flute. (all laugh)
Matt: All right, so, Keyleth.
Marisha: So, upon seeing this big thing crash in, and I'm like, oh. Now you're really angry. But I just kind of analyze him and I say okay, and then I go, (grunts), and I turn into a rhinoceros.
All: Ooh!
Matt: Okay, I don't have a rhinoceros mini on me, so we'll use a bear for the time being, but we'll know it's a rhinoceros.
Sam: Why don't you have a rhinoceros?
Matt: 'Cause I was not prepared for such things.
Liam: Way to slack off, Mercer.
Matt: Hey, I'm gonna order a rhinoceros now, you happy? I'm gonna go to Toys R Us.
Taliesin: Get the whole animal collection. Actually got them, the whole set.
Matt: So you transform into a rhinoceros, now basically facing an armored beast with an armored beast.
Marisha: Kaiju battle. (all laugh)
Matt: Whatcha got, whatcha doing?
Marisha: I'm charging him.
Travis: Activity in the Breach.
Matt: You leap down, go in for the attack, this duergar already used its reaction, so it can't attack you.
Marisha: So if he fails to save, I knock him over. That's plus seven, so 19?
Matt: 19 does hit.
Marisha: Awesome!
Matt: Does save though, is not knocked over.
Marisha: A strength save?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Aw, damn it.
Matt: This is a big creature.
Marisha: He does, I do 2d8 of bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Seven, nine, 14 damage.
Matt: 14 damage, all right. You have multi attack or did you get the one hit?
Marisha: Well, I charged, yeah.
Matt: Okay yeah, so the charge is the hit. But you slam into it, your horn gores, you can see actually, you slam it into the side of the armor wound that Grog left and then Tiberius pried open. Part of it gets pulled back, and you see a quick splatter of some sort of bloody splash as you're staring to actually pull apart its interior. The horn is jabbed in there, and it manages to shrug it off at the last point. You do significant gore to its side.
Liam: Good musical riff.
Marisha: Oh, wait. No no no, that's right, keep going. It's actually 15 damage. I always forget that I have a plus one to attack.
Matt: 15? Yeah, don't forget that. You need to remember that. After taking the arrow wound, and after everyone else attacking around it, it's going to try and get a different situation. It's going to jump. It rears back, and leaps into the air.
Sam: Oh jesus.
Matt: Landing right on top of Clarota and Scanlan.
Sam: Oh no!
Ashley: Wait, does he get, do we get--
Matt: You guys all get attacks on it as it jumps away.
Marisha: We all get attacks?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Do I?
Matt: No, you do not.
Marisha: We get advantage, right?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Did he take me, no he didn't take me.
Matt: No, actually, you are still in its hand. In its mouth, it carries you with it.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: Okay, so 19, you hit.
Liam: 24.
Matt: Hit.
Travis: 26.
Matt: Hit. No, it's the three of you, so that's it. So all of you guys just roll damage for a basic attack.
Sam: Come on, kill him before he gets to me.
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24 damage? 24 damage you said? Nice.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Was I close enough to him to get an attack?
Matt: No you weren't, unfortunately.
Liam: 11.
Matt: 11, all righty, and?
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: So, as it lands. All of you guys have to make a strength or dex saving throw, your choice. For Percy.
Taliesin: Dex.
Matt: And Scanlan, and I'm rolling for Clarota. Clarota fails.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: It's okay, it's okay, Scanlan. It's okay, you can do this.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: 20.
Sam: He's coming back from the other dimension. I rolled a nine.
Orion: Did it hit the floor or did you go again?
Sam: No, I used the one that rolled on the floor.
Laura: Roll it on the table, that doesn't count.
Matt: So Clarota is not prone.
Sam: Dungeon Master, does a roll on the floor count? What happened?
Matt: I usually roll on the table. I usually prefer to roll on the table.
Sam: It's even worse. (all laugh)
Liam: That'll learn ya.
Matt: You guys are knocked prone on the ground, and you all take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 14 points of slashing damage. As he just lands on top of you. Yeah, so 28 points of damage, as it crushes you, and its claws sink into you. Clarota takes the same.
Liam: Did it drag Percy through the air?
Taliesin: Yes it did.
Laura: It did?
Taliesin: My arms are still stuck in its mouth.
Matt: You're not knocked prone, but you do take 14 points of crushing damage, as its mouth bites down on your arm again, for free.
Taliesin: That's fine.
Matt: It's going to actually release you, Percy. So you're there.
Marisha: Think your arm might be a bit busted.
Matt: It turns, and makes a bite attack against Scanlan.
Sam: As he does I distract him. (air horn blowing) (all laugh)
Sam: Playing my shawm.
Matt: That's the sound a shawm makes?
Sam: Cutting Words reaction.
Matt: Okay, so as your reaction, go ahead and do that, so roll the d8.
Ashley: (imitates horn)
Travis: It's like the start of a Pitbull song.
Sam: Six.
Matt: Okay, he rolled a 27. Reduced it by seven to 19. So even with the reduction, it's not enough, you're on the ground. It sinks its teeth right into you. You take, let's see.
Liam: These games keep getting better.
Matt: You take 41 points of piercing damage.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Liam: Scanlan!
Sam: No worries, I'm just at negative 36 now. (all laugh)
Marisha: Really?
Sam: Yep.
Matt: Okay, so.
Marisha: Wait, how did that happen?
Taliesin: That happened fast.
Liam: He's unconscious, he's in bad shape, but we're gonna get him.
Matt: Scanlan's looking rough, Scanlan is now just being thrashed around in the mouth of the creature.
Travis: How many hit points do you have?
Matt: His limp arms and legs just (thumping) as it's kind of just running him around and across the air.
Liam: Hashtag save Scanlan. Strings of gnome blood are being flung across the room.
Liam: Oh, he's so little though, he's so little.
Matt: Pike, your turn.
Ashley: Okay, so time for a Cure Wounds. So I guess. Let's see.
Matt: You can't even see him right now. If you want to Cure Wounds, you have to touch him.
Ashley: I'll go, yeah, I'll go.
Sam: I'm being thrashed around.
Ashley: Can I just go, he's over there?
Laura: He's in the mouth of the thing.
Liam: She's 25 speed.
Matt: So you can move five squares.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Didn't you get that speed boost?
Ashley: How close can I get to him? I can't see the lines in the squares.
Orion: Don't forget your boots, Pike.
Ashley: Oh, I have sprinter's boots! I have sprinter's boots. Okay, so I'm gonna use my sprinter's boots. I can-- While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action, and click the boots' heels together, if you do, the boots double your walking speed for one minute.
Matt: So you can move ten squares, takes your bonus action.
Ashley: So then, I'm so sorry, I can't see the squares. So if I can get ten to get over there.
Matt: So you go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, there is a ledge there, and he's blocking the way up, so nine, ten, make an acrobatics check to actually jump and climb up onto the--
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: With disadvantage, 'cause you have plate armor.
Liam: But what about her--
Matt: Disadvantage, you roll twice and take a lower.
Ashley: Wait, wait, hold on. Can I cast Guided Strike? Which adds ten to--
Sam: I gave you a dice. I gave you a dice.
Liam: Which means you're-- Ten.
Matt: Total of ten?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: That's exactly what you needed. (all cheer)
Matt: That was the baseline. You run up, it takes all the strength you can feel, you're gonna be sore in the morning. All your muscles tense as you pull yourself up, with all the inertia from the run, your parkour up to the top, land, Scanlan's there, currently being flung around, you manage to reach up and grab him, and get in a brief tug of war with the bulette creature.
Ashley: Hey, get away from him, man!
Matt: As you cast Cure Wounds. Go ahead and--
Ashley: So that's Mass Cure Wounds, so does that heal--
Matt: Is it Mass Cure Wounds, or just doing Cure Wounds?
Ashley: I'll just do Cure Wounds.
Matt: So at what level are you using?
Sam: Don't chintz out.
Ashley: I'm gonna use it at the highest-- I'll use it at fifth level.
Sam: Cast whatever you can cast.
Liam: It's one or multiple people.
Sam: Can you do it at a higher level?
Ashley: Yeah, I'll do it at my highest level that I can cast, which is--
Sam: Let's not cheap out on Scanlan here.
Ashley: Sorry guys, I'm just warming up again. (all laugh)
Travis: Let's not skimp on Scanlan.
Liam: Remember when I brought you back from the dead? Remember that? Remember that?
Sam: Remember when my kiss healed you from death? Just throwing that out there.
Ashley: -- which I think is eight.
Matt: So it's 5d8 + 5. 5d8 + 5 is how much you're healing him.
Liam: You're gonna be all right.
Ashley: My spell attack bonus, plus eight?
Matt: You don't have to worry about the bonus, you're just touching him.
Ashley: So 5d8 + 5.
Matt: Is what you're healing him, yes. All right.
Sam: That's three.
Liam: I think you did it four times, yeah.
Ashley: 18, plus five.
Sam: I thought that was three, no?
Ashley: Yeah, 23, 23.
Sam: Plus five.
Liam: That was plus five.
Laura: Are you still unconscious?
Sam: But now I'm only negative 11.
Ashley: Wait, what?
Sam: I've taken almost 100 points of damage in this.
Matt: You're unconscious, how it works in this, and this is different from Pathfinder-- Yeah, you go to zero and you stay there. You are now up to 23.
Liam: You don't go below zero, you hit zero, and you're there, making rolls to see if you die.
Laura: You only have three chances if you roll, fail, three times, you die.
Matt: And if something hits you while you're unconscious, it's an automatic fail. Now you're 23 hit points.
Sam: Hey, I feel great, guys! (all laugh)
Matt: You're still in its mouth being shook around.
Sam: Oh shit! (all laugh)
Sam: What is this ride? This is crazy!
Matt: Pike, that's your turn.
Ashley: I can't do anything else, right?
Matt: Clarota's going to get up.
Liam: Come on Clarota, show us what you got.
Matt: Clarota looks pretty rough. Rears back.
Liam: Got to bring that mental power and that arcane magic, let's do it.
Matt: Taking a cue from the opening you left, Clarota pulls back its hand, you see a familiar spark of bluish electrical energy as Clarota reaches for unleashing a torrent of electrical arcane energy forward, into the form of a Lightning Bolt. Blasting across the bow of this giant creature. Let's see. Does not make its saving throw, so it's 32 points of lightning damage.
Laura: Clarota!
Matt: As the back of its armor is now seared, and you can see parts of its armored flesh are kind of blackened and charred and slightly crimping. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, so I've got enough room to run up to its anus, which I'll do.
Travis: As you always do.
Liam: It's got plenty of people around, so that means I can Sneak Attack him.
Matt: As you rush past, before you attack? This duergar that was right by you, that has currently grown to a larger size gets a free swing at you.
Liam: Ain't no thing.
Matt: That's going to be a 21 to hit.
Liam: Okay, that hits.
Matt: All right, with its war pike it takes-- deals 14 points of damage to you.
Liam: Who cares, I'm saving my gnome friend, okay. Here I go. 14, it's a 25 to hit his butt.
Matt: 25 hits.
Liam: This is my keen dagger, with vorpal blade, two plus seven is nine, that's just nine. Where's a pencil, that's a pencil. And then we add my Sneak Attack damage, which is six, seven, ten. 15. 21, plus nine, is 30.
Matt: All right, nice.
Liam: To the butt. Specifically to the butt.
Matt: As you rush up, you take a moment as it's thrashing about, and you can see what looks, anatomy-wise, to be probably where it expels whatever it eats.
Liam: The hole? Right in there.
Matt: You go ahead and just slash and eviscerate there.
Liam: How do you like me now?
Matt: Even back there it's heavily armored, it takes, you carve through, and it-- You've definitely left a lasting impression on this bulette.
Liam: Pucker up, baby, pucker up.
Sam: Hashtag, armored anus. (all laugh)
Travis: What, what, in the butt.
Liam: This is D&D in 2015, people, 2015. So that's the first attack, right? Now I get a second attack?
Matt: The general also, by the way, appears as the concentration spell was lost as you were unconscious.
Sam: I must have stopped concentrating for some reason.
Matt: However, it is right in front of, it's like. It's now in his face.
Liam: Second attack. 22.
Matt: That hits. Okay, and that's a four plus ten, ten points of fire-based damage to the butt.
Matt: All right. (all laugh)
Travis: Preparation H? Fire damage to the anus.
Matt: That brings us to his turn.
Laura: The general's?
Matt: The general's turn, who now is there from the bulette, sees it, looks over and sees you.
Travis: It's right in front of him!
Matt: Kind of sitting there with your bloody hand. It's still flaming, swings back, and goes for your head.
Taliesin: God.
Matt: That is a 23 versus armor class.
Taliesin: Ah, yeah, that's gonna hit. Armor class sucks.
Matt: Plus the fire damage.
Ashley: What are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 39 I wanna say?
Matt: Well, you take 31 points of damage. Including the fire damage from the pike, it goes for its second attack against you.
Travis: This thing sucks.
Matt: That's gonna be a 22 versus armor class.
Taliesin: That's gonna hit.
Liam: It's a tank.
Travis: One.
Matt: You take... That's gonna be 21 points of damage.
Taliesin: I'm out. Okay, Percy being pummeled and pummeled again. Loses, your gun falls from your hand, as you slump to the ground, your eyes roll back, unconsciousness and darkness.
Sam: We're droppin' like flies!
Matt: Taking you. That brings us to--
Ashley: Everybody knows shit's fucked.
Matt: Grog.
Travis: What, me? Bah! How tall is the thing?
Matt: Tall? I'd say it's probably about... 20 feet tall? 15, 20 feet tall?
Travis: Can I climb up on its back?
Matt: It's not your size, it'd be really, really tight, pinning in there.
Travis: I would like to run up to its right side and flank it.
Matt: Over here?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So you run around. Which you can do, 'cause you're a freaking barbarian.
Travis: (snarls)
Matt: All right, go ahead, you're making your attacks. Go for it, three strikes against it.
Travis: 21. Hits, right?
Matt: 21 definitely hits.
Travis: 16 plus eight, hits.
Matt: Definitely hits.
Travis: Natural 20! (all cheer)
Travis: Does that mean I get extra?
Liam: Double damage, it means double damage.
Travis: Oh, double damage, okay.
Matt: So first strike.
Ashley: Kill him, kill him, kill him!
Travis: 16?
Matt: 16 damage?
Travis: Yes.
Laura: 21.
Travis: 21, thank you.
Liam: Stay in school, kids.
Travis: Stay on the table.
Matt: It's the critical now, so double the dice roll.
Travis: 20, thank you, and. 15, plus that, 20.
Matt: You double the dice, then add the modifier.
Travis: Oh, double the second one.
Laura: So that's 40 on the last one.
Sam: Jesus.
Laura: So 61, 76.
Matt: How do you want to do this, Grog? (all cheer)
Ashley: Oh, you killed him?
Liam: Yes!
Matt: How you wanna do this, Grog?
Travis: I would like to chop down into the fleshy bit, and after I've sliced--
Matt: The fleshy bit is on the opposite side, by the way. So you're now at an unarmored side. However, it's still holding Scanlan in its mouth, shaking him around, so, how do you wanna finish it?
Travis: Can I get to its mouth at all?
Matt: I could say for the flavor of this, yeah, you manage to just barely make it over here.
Travis: I would like to swing through and catch the corner of its mouth, open its mouth wide, and then I'd like to reach in, and with my teeth, pull its fucking tongue out of its head, and start thrashing it side to side. (all laugh)
Matt: First you rush up with your ax, using all of the aggression, you take it and swing it, barely leaving you with a shave. You gash the side of its mouth, and draw this giant wound open. As it does, you actually snap, and cut through the tendons that clench the jaw, causing it to fall open and slack. Scanlan spills out of its mouth, hitting the ground with a dull thud. As its mouth is now open, it kind of rears back. You shake your head angrily, as the froth is gathering at the corners of your mouth. You drop your ax from one hand, grab the jaw, reach in, bite down on its giant meaty tongue. Using your hand at the back of it, you pull and yank and you feel the muscle tearing and tensing before, eventually it comes free, and is now dangling about 25, 30 pounds, of very very wet, tongue meat. With your third attack, how do you finish it? (all laugh)
Travis: What do you after you're biting its tongue in your mouth?
Matt: That's what I'm asking.
Travis: That's a good point.
Matt: It's looking really rough, but you still need to get that final death blow. What are you doing with this, Grog?
Ashley: Rip him apart.
Travis: Yeah, I'm gonna King Kong his jaw. I'm gonna take the broken part, the top of his head, and just pull apart.
Matt: Okay, so you drop your ax entirely, the tongue still dangling from your mouth. You reach and put one foot up into the bottom of the jaw, using your other hands you push and push, you hear it crack, and pull, as it tenses and is trying to push down. It has no tension because the jaw was destroyed. You pull back and hear a sickening snap, as the armor plate buckles underneath where the neck joint would be on such a creature. Its eyes kinda roll back for a second, and it begins to slacken. As it does, you reach up with your fist, and penetrate the bottom of where its brain would be. With a sickening (suction) sound, it goes entirely limp and collapses on the ground.
Liam: And that's why you're on the team. (all cheer)
Travis: And as it falls, the tongue that's hanging in my mouth, I look to one of the dwarves that's left, I go, who's next? (all laugh)
Matt: We're gonna end it there for the night. (all groan)
Matt: Damn guys, well done.
Taliesin: I'm sleeping.
Sam: Oh, Percy's dead, hashtag save Percy.
Laura: I want more chicken.
Matt: Before we finish, I'd say go ahead and throw a heal up on him.
Marisha: Oh yeah.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Ashley: Good plan.
Matt: It's nasty, man. You guys picked that, by the way.
Laura: Oh seriously?
Travis: They did? You dicks!
Taliesin: You suck.
Zac: That was the chat room.
Orion: Try harder next time.
Matt: We'll be doing more of those as time goes on. Not all the time, but whenever I have the opportunity to put it in there, I'm gonna start asking for you guys to help me figure out what to throw at these adventurers.
Liam: You sadists. (all laugh)
Zac: We shouldn't tell them the other options, should we, just in case we wanna save them.
Matt: Oh no, they'll come back in, don't worry.
Ashley: 25.
Taliesin: Oh wow, I feel much better.
Zac: So you guys, we're gonna be doing a Q and A.
Matt: Yeah, for anyone who wants to stay over.
Zac: Anyone who wants to stick around, the audience has a ton of questions for you guys. For the audience, it's a sub-only Q and A, so if you're been wondering whether or not you should sub, let me give you some reasons why. Number one, you can ask these guys questions in a little bit. Number two, every 50 subs, we're giving away tabletop promo kits that are like $250 worth of special stuff, and we will ship that internationally, doesn't matter. Even in Antarctica. We want someone in Antarctica to do tabletop day, do you know anyone?
Matt: I don't.
Zac: We had someone last year.
Matt: Well shit, we gotta reach out then.
Zac: They're gone, they were like the only people there, and they're gone.
Matt: There's nobody there left, they were the last bastion. Well, somebody needs to move to Antarctica in the next few days and let us know, so then we can totally use that.
Zac: We also do a Minecraft server, for subs only, but if you want in on that, there's no automated message for that server info, so just make sure and message the Geek & Sundry account, and we'll get you that sub IP address for the Minecraft server. I know we have more, there's lots more stuff. We do some other sub-only chats throughout the week. lots of emotes, other fun stuff. But we're gonna go ahead and roll some videos while we get set up for the Q and A. This was a lot of fun, oh! I would like to challenge you guys to do a quick little donation drive for the charity that you guys support.
Matt: Yeah, for 826LA. Had it going up in the chat room, if you have the opportunity, you wanna help support these children getting side educations and tutoring.
Zac: You guys wanna tell them about, just to get them psyched up for it? 'Cause we can get that command going.
Marisha: Yeah, 826LA, they're a non-profit organization that helps primarily with literacy and creative story children for children between the ages of like five and 18. They have a really great young authors book that you can buy that's a collection of all of the kids' book, and you can also go and check out the time travel mart, there's one in Echo Park and then there's also one in Marina Del Rey. But you should just google 826, 'cause I know there's one in Seattle, I know there's one in like Atlanta. New York, San Francisco. There might be an 826 in your city.
Liam: 826LA probably, right?
Marisha: 826LA is who we're raising money for. But yeah all of the 826 store fronts are a little bit different, depending on where you go. They're super cool.
Matt: Guys, please, check it out, it's awesome. It's a good group of people, what they do is fantastic. If you have the opportunity please do, go ahead and donate to the charity.
Matt: Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in for the fourth episode of Critical Role, with the grand return of Pike, our cleric. (all laugh)
Matt: Necessary. Glad to have you back, I'm sure everyone here is glad to have the healer back.
Laura: Especially today.
Taliesin: Very happy today.
Matt: And a surprise return of Laura, so.
Laura: What a time to join the game.
Matt: Heck yeah. All right guys, well, we're gonna take a little bit to set up for the Q and A. Those who can stay, feel free to, those who can't, totally understand. We have kids and families to get to. Those who can will be here for the Q and A for the next hour or so.
Zac: One more thing, just so they know we're following through. We have the picture for you guys to sign. So Niareth won this, when we reached 1,000 subs, so I think Pike is all that's left for that.
Matt: Pike is left to sign this Player's Handbook.
Sam: I haven't signed it.
Zac: And then we've got the picture. So we'll pass that around while we're doing the set up.
Matt: Do any of you have the gold marker?
Zac: I'll find it.
Matt: All right, cool. Yeah guys we're gonna go ahead and set up for this, we'll see you in a little bit for the Q and A, thank you everyone for watching. Thanks guys. Awesome day at Critical Role, thanks.
Ashley: Bye!
Wil: Hey nerds, I'm Wil Wheaton, I know right? And guess what? It is back. International Tabletop Day has returned, this year on April 11th. What is that, you say? What is Tabletop Day? Well, if you don't know, then shame on you. International Tabletop Day is a worldwide celebration dedicated to the tabletop games we love to play with the people we love. People we like, people we've never even met before, it doesn't matter, last year we had over 3,000 registered events across seven continents and over 80 countries, that is amazing! But this year we're going to make it even bigger. "Will Wheaton, how can we make it even bigger than last year?" That's what she said. Start now. Trend #TabletopDay on Twitter, because that was awesome. Broadcast your plans on the internet, make a video, share pictures, start a blog, create a dating profile for other sexy gamers in your area, whatever you want. Celebrate it in your own way, but we wanna hear from you. Be sure to use #TabletopDay, or @TabletopDay to let us know. It is up to you, world. Visit TabletopDay.com to register your event, or find one near you. You can also download exclusive content and check out some of our favorite games. We will be streaming our own live event, here in Los Angeles for you to watch. And there will be more on that soon. You love tabletop games, and we love you, so join us in the global celebration, on April 11th. Play more games. Hey everybody, I'm Wil Wheaton, and I am coming to you semi-live from the Twitch TV set here at the Geek & Sundry stages in beautiful downtown Burbank, California. I am here to tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Tabletop's RPG show, coming this June, but were afraid to ask. Or have been asking for close to a year and I've been saying, "We'll tell you at some point in the future." You can consider this the big announcement. It was incredibly difficult to cast this show. We needed people who were very comfortable improvising, who had experience playing role playing games, and who were available when we planned to shoot the show. It was surprisingly difficult to get a pool of people who fit all of those criteria, and choose the most awesome among them. So your cast playing in this wonderful show are: Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Bailey, Hank Green, and Alison Haislip. I'm really excited to have these people all together. They're all my friends, they are all wonderful storytellers, and they are going to be a tremendous party of adventurers. I'm only gonna try to kill them a little bit. The most frequently asked question since I announced that there was going to be a Tabletop RPG show is, hey Wil Wheaton! Why are you so awesome? The second most frequently asked question is, what system are you using to power this game? First and foremost, I needed a system that was going to support the way I play roleplaying games, and that is telling a story collaboratively with a group of players with me as the GM. I looked at some very well known systems like Dungeons & Dragons, and Savage Worlds, I looked at systems that I love, like Fate Core, and I even looked at the True 20, a d20 modern system. And I really wanted to use something that was released by an independent publisher. I wanted to bring something to the forefront of the roleplaying world that maybe not as many people are familiar with as I want them to be. But I wanna play the way that I played when I was falling in love with roleplaying games when I was a kid. I wanna be able to sit around on a couch and some chairs with my friends, not have to worry about a map on a table in front of us, and just work together to use our imaginations to tell a story. But there's a system that I really love that's elegant, it's easy to learn, it's easy to teach, it's very easy to understand, and it really just gets out of the way when you want to tell a story together. And that is the Adventure Game Engine that Green Ronin Publishing used to drive the Dragon Age tabletop roleplaying game. I asked the developer three years ago to please make generic, so that we can build a setting and put on top of it. They said actually this is something we really wanna do. And it's come together. We have been able to work together with Green Ronin to develop the fantasy Adventure Game Engine. This is gonna take a lot of the things you know from the Dragon Age RPG, and put it all together to support our world, which I have had the best time creating. I sat down three months ago with some amazing writers, and just started brainstorming about what kind of world we wanted to explore. But what I kept coming back to is, I love science fiction, and I love fantasy. Why not put them together? Why not build a world that is inspired by the 1978 Heavy Metal movie, and 1980's amazing Saturday morning cartoon show, Thundarr the Barbarian. I thought it would be great for characters to encounter goblinoid kind of creatures, and instead of them using crossbows, they're using laser rifles. I've got it all worked out, we have a huge team of writers that put all this together that built an amazing codex that gave terrific logic to all of these decisions that we made. We're not gonna tell you what they are. You may discover some of them during the course of the season. So what is the name of this incredible world? The title of our show is Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana. You can sort of come up with your own ideas about what those words mean. I know, but I'm not telling. 'Cause that's not how the Wheaton talks. Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana will premiere right here at Geekandsundry.com on June 2nd. For those of you not in America, Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana will premiere right here on Geek & Sundry on two June. So I hope that you're as excited about this as I am, and I hope that you will tune in, and then watch us for ten straight weeks of incredible high adventure story telling, and until then, play more games.
Ivan: Hey guys, Ivan here, the host of Game the Game, on Geek & Sundry's new Twitch channel. I'm here with Becca, Ify, and Hector, to get you excited about International Tabletop Day. So International Tabletop Day is going to be on April 11th, and all of our friends at AEG have brought us an amazing edition of Love Letter in order to play with you today. That's right nerds. It's Batman Love Letter. Now Batman Love Letter is a game of logic, deduction, and risk, in which you try to capture or hold the highest value card in your hand by the end of the rounds. In the meantime we'll all be playing cards in order to eliminate each other. But whoever has the highest-value card at the end of the round will win a token. So who will be the greatest detective in all of Gotham? It's gonna be Batman.
Becca: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it'll be Poison Ivy.
Ify: You guys both are wrong, it's going to be Bane.
Hector: It's probably not gonna be Robin. (all laugh)
Ivan: Now, normally we will play until seven tokens, but for the purposes of this video, we'll play until three. Whoever gets three is gonna win. Let's play. Pass out your cards Becca, one to each.
Becca: Burn the first?
Ivan: Burn the first. You have to burn a card before you even begin, because there is a mystery card that isn't in play normally. So keep that in mind when you're playing.
Hector: Burning a card, who are we playing with? The Batman villain Firefly? (all laugh)
Ify: Leave the jokes to me, Robin.
Hector: All right, fine.
Ify: Just so you know, I'm doing a set at the comedy store, and I need three friends to show up.
Hector: What night is it? I'm busy that night.
Ify: I didn't even give you the time yet.
Ivan: Hector, why don't you go first?
Hector: Robin.
Ivan: Robin, the man wonder.
Hector: Okay, here we go. I'm gonna play Robin. I've got protection for my entire next round.
Ivan: Right. So every single time you play a card, normally it has an action that is attached to it. So I'm playing Catwoman, who allows me to look at another player's hand. Poison Ivy? Noted. Now it's your turn.
Becca: It's my turn, so I draw a card. I'm gonna hang on to that one, maybe. And I also play Catwoman. And I'm going to look at Bane's hand. That's terrible.
Ify: You make fun of me but you lack the understanding of my strategy. I will play the Batman. I can't guess Robin's because he has immunity, but I can guess Poison Ivy's.
Ivan: If he can guess correctly, not only does he get a token, but she's eliminated from the round, and now there's only three of us available. So it's one step closer to victory. What's your guess?
Ify: My guess is Two-Face.
Becca: Incorrect.
Ivan: Robin?
Hector: Thanks, Batman. All right, here we go. I'm also gonna play Batman. I'm gonna guess that Poison Ivy has the Joker card.
Becca: Incorrect.
Hector: Darn it. Jiminey Jillickers.
Becca: Now you have to do something terribly embarrassing, right? Or is that just Half Scrolls?
Hector: Like maybe wear a Robin costume, cool, sounds good. Oh, already doing it, great. So great.
Ivan: I have two cards and I'm going to also play the Batman. You've been picked on a lot, Poison Ivy.
Becca: I've been picked on so much.
Ivan: You played a Batman.
Hector: Get him Batman.
Ivan: I'm gonna guess you've got a Poison Ivy.
Ify: You're wrong!
Ivan: (groans)
Ify: No survivors!
Ivan: (laughs) All right, I'm done, go ahead, Poison Ivy.
Becca: If anyone's wondering why so many Batman cards are being drawn, it's because there are five in the deck. There's either one or two of all the other characters. So I draw, and I will play, myself, Poison Ivy. This card says, choose any player including yourself to discard his or her hand, and draw a new card. Ivan, you look pretty confident. Discard.
Ivan: Discard, all right.
Becca: And draw a new hand.
Ivan: Had a Two-Face.
Ify: It's time for me to draw.
Ivan: I have a hard time thinking that we're gonna get anything out of you in that mask.
Ify: Oh, you'll see.
Becca: I'm sorry, what?
Ify: You'll see.
Becca: What did he say?
Ivan: I think it's something about seals?
Becca: Did you need help opening a seal?
Ify: I'll play the Batman, and I will guess Becca again, she has the Harley Quinn.
Becca: Incorrect.
Hector: Geez, we're terrible at this game.
Ivan: We're really, really bad.
Becca: I'm great at it.
Ify: Sooner or later.
Ivan: He's in there, or he's there. Not there, there. Not there, there.
Becca: There?
Ivan: There.
Becca: Where?
Hector: I'm going to play my own version of Bane. That was terrible.
Becca: You don't have the mask.
Hector: Myself and another player can secretly compare hands, and whichever hand is lowest is out. So I'm gunning for you, Poison Ivy. Because you kissed me that one time, and then you didn't wanna hang out with me afterwards, like that was really mean, so.
Becca: I had ulterior motives.
Ivan: I'm not looking, Batman's not looking.
Becca: I'm out of the game.
Hector: You're out, yes!
Becca: I had myself again.
Ivan: Which means you have a higher numbered card.
Hector: Yes, that is correct.
Ivan: Higher than five.
Hector: Good detective work, Batman. Real genius, this one.
Ivan: All right. This is the last card of the deck, which means after this, whoever has the highest card, wins.
Hector: Duh, Batman, we know, God.
Ivan: I'm playing Robin, Robin. All right?
Becca: That makes me think he has the Joker.
Ivan: Well, we'll find out won't we? What do you got?
Ify: I had myself.
Hector: Boom, Harley Quinn beats Bane.
Ivan: And the Joker beats Harley Quinn.
Hector: Darn it.
Ivan: I got you, Joker.
Becca: Take your token.
Ivan: I will take my narcissistic token that has my symbol on it.
Hector: This is just what Batman needed, an ego boost. Batman needed an ego boost, great.
Ify: Robin.
Becca: The deb chef, the deb chef.
Hector: You seem to live with a multi billionaire, yet can't afford contacts. What's the deal with that?
Becca: No burn card, no burn card.
Ivan: Oh, great. So since I won the last round, I get to play first, because I am the greatest detective. And I got a Catwoman, which means I think I'm interested in Bane's hand. Whatcha got, Bane? You got crap, is what he's got.
Becca: Choose any player including yourself to discard his or her hand and draw a new card. Hector, burn your card.
Hector: You got it, but it's Robin, and I'm not gonna tell you again. All right, I had Batman, which is cool, because he's the least value card in the game, so that's just gonna help me out, so I'm just gonna grab a new card.
Ify: All right, I'm going to draw. Draw a card. Oof, oof, oof, such a good card.
Ivan: Who are you gonna use it on, Bane?
Becca: It's probably Batman.
Ify: I'm gonna do a Batman card. Robin, do you have Poison Ivy?
Hector: (laughs) No.
Ify: My turn is over.
Hector: All right, it's my turn. Dick Grayson and Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, Carrie Kelley, John Blake, help me. Okay, here we go. My girl Selina Kyle, Catwoman, bam. And I wanna look at Bane's hand. Show me back here buddy, show me back here, whatcha got?
Ify: Got this.
Hector: Okay, good to know.
Ivan: All right. I'm going to just play my ward Robin.
Hector: You're welcome.
Ivan: Grant me immunity.
Becca: Batman. I'm gonna guess that Bane has Poison Ivy.
Ify: You're wrong!
Becca: You'll never have Poison Ivy.
Ify: I'll use Catwoman.
Becca: To look at another player's hands.
Hector: Pause for error.
Ify: I will look at Poison Ivy's hand.
Hector: Don't do it Bane, don't fall into that venus fly trap. Get it, 'cause it's a trap, 'cause it's. It's a plant based pun.
Ivan: Good job.
Ify: Ah.
Ivan: There it is.
Ify: Ah. Ah!
Ivan: Robin, Robin go ahead.
Hector: Okay, here we go.
Ivan: What's it gonna be?
Hector: I'm gonna play Batman. And I'm gonna guess that Bane Has a Batman card.
Ify: You are wrong.
Ivan: For once he doesn't have a Batman card.
Ify: I want to point out to the watchers. Hector looked at my hand.
Hector: Oh I did, that's true.
Ify: And saw me play the card. He knew exactly which card was in my hand. And chose the wrong card.
Ivan: This is why you're the boy wonder, and not Batman.
Hector: I'd like to point out, that my chest has made me very uncomfortable, and I'm clearly out of my element, and dressing me up as Robin was a good call everybody, good call everyone. Good call guys. Wow.
Ify: I really thought that was game over for me. I was wrong.
Hector: Oh my God. Your annoying voice has really gotten into my head.
Becca: That's his greatest power.
Ivan: I also have the Batman. So we know he doesn't have a Batman, you know what it is. Thanks Robin. Useless. So I'm gonna guess that Bane has Harley Quinn.
Ify: You are wrong!
Ivan: Damn. I tried. All the clues are there, just one missing element.
Becca: I played Batman, I'm going to guess that Bane has Two-Face.
Ify: You are wrong as well.
Ivan: He has the Joker then, or something. How can you throw that many Batmans at a single man, and not get what he's got in his hand.
Hector: He really did break you, he really did. And now I'm Nightwing, great, that's how long that took.
Ify: I'm going to say. Two-Face can trade hands with Becca.
Becca: (sighs)
Ivan: That's where it was. Robin?
Hector: It's my turn.
Ivan: Diddly fingers.
Hector: You guys think you're gonna win this? You don't know Dick. Greyson, because that's my real name. I'm gonna play Bane.
Becca: Bane-in it up.
Ivan: What's up, who's gonna compare?
Hector: It's gonna be you, Batman. Let's see what you got, old chum. Oh hoh, bye, you're out. (laughs)
Ivan: Batman card, so. Batman's out.
Becca: Batman's the worst.
Hector: Oh my gosh.
Ivan: How's it feel to knock a man down from his tower?
Hector: It feels great.
Ivan: Right, okay.
Hector: How's it feel for not giving me--
Marisha: Great for my back.
Zac: We're live.
Matt: What's up everyone, we got this camera right here in the middle, right?
Ashley: Hello.
Liam: Oh, hi.
Matt: Thank you guys for watching. Hope you enjoyed yourselves. These guys all being crazy players, and kicking ass, and occasionally getting knocked unconscious, and nearly eaten.
Zac: Any mods want to put this in sub mode for us? Let's do sub mode.
Marisha: So you have to sub. Bye everybody who's not a sub.
Ashley: Bye!
Zac: They can still watch, they just can't ask questions.
Orion: Oh. Okay.
Marisha: Well, your word is not important.
Liam: Laura had to bugger out.
Ashley: Wait, is that a little icon of you?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: What?
Orion: Yeah, he's an emoji now.
Ashley: You're an emoji?
Matt: It's weird.
Taliesin: He's made it.
Ashley: You've made it.
Matt: All right, so how are we doing the questions? Are we just picking as we go?
Zac: You can moderate yourselves.
Ashley: Laura and Sam did leave.
Matt: Unfortunately.
Ashley: Laura had to go to a thing, and Sam had to go to a thing.
Matt: Sam's thing is kids. Sam has two kids. Liam has two kids, but he--
Ashley: Hey look at-- (all laugh)
Matt: I am so sorry, everyone.
Liam: I mean he's pretty good at Dungeon Mastering, right?
Ashley: Yeah, he's pretty good.
Orion: Someone asked what alignment we are. First question, what alignment are our characters?
Marisha: We're all good.
Liam: Chaotic good.
Ashley: Chaotic good.
Orion: Tiberius is chaotic good.
Travis: Chaotic neutral, bitches.
Liam: What was your first roleplaying experience? I saw that go through.
Taliesin: GURPS in high school.
All: GURPS.
Matt: The second edition of Dungeons & Dragons in high school.
Travis: This.
Ashley: Was my first, yeah.
Liam: This guy just started. I did AD&D in high school, and I DM'ed while playing, which is totally cheating. This is the first pure experience I've had.
Orion: This is my first campaign also. I was a Magic the Gathering fan.
Marisha: I actually had Matt as my first DM, way before All this started. So I played a few other games, and then, now I'm back to the OG master.
Liam: I saw, when and how did you all start playing together? The reason this started is because, I directed Matt as Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil 6, and every time he came in he would say, "hey, you know, I'm running a game, you can come in and just do a one off." And I was like, "oh, I got babies, I can't do that, I can't do that, I can't do that." And then finally once for my birthday I thought, I can do a one off, it'll be the only time we'll do it, just see how it goes. Scanlan and I did a podcast together, and every week we would do some new thing, and we're like fuck it, let's play D&D. We all did it and everybody got snake bit, and it's been the best thing that ever happened. To me at least.
Ashley: Yup.
Orion: Our character alignments do matter on how we play the characters, an earlier question.
Matt: Yeah, they do definitely matter. A couple quick answers here. The conversion from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition was decided because, as we're going on to this show, and we had so many players, combat tends to get bogged down, and a lot of floating modifiers in Pathfinder. For large groups like this it's difficult to keep it flowing and moving. I felt once I had taken a look at Fifth Edition, that the combat system was a little more simplified, and a little easier to make freeform and just roll with it. So that was a much better decision. Plus Dungeons & Dragons generally has a better name recognition than Pathfinder, so when you're putting a show out there, it's probably easier to do with very minimal transition, it took a little bit of customizing, like for Percy's gunslinger. We just had to customize it, we made it ourselves. We sat down.
Taliesin: Took a day.
Matt: Took a day, and we worked out, some of the stuff we wanted to keep, some of the things that didn't break it, we wanted to make it interesting. It is a martial archetype for the fighter class. So it does give the bonus a fighter class does. Nothing is too overpowered about it, other than just having custom weapons, and some cool grit-based abilities that we kinda transferred over from Pathfinder. It's interesting. It's a good challenge to see how it works out.
Taliesin: It is, it's working out. I'm digging it. I keep reading and finding things I'm not doing that could be more interesting, so.
Matt: Keeping your hand and firing into the mouth of a bulette is fun.
Taliesin: That felt great.
Liam: Travis, everybody's asking about your shirt.
Travis: Oh. I think it's a website called redbubble.com? I just googled Grog, and there was that.
Taliesin: Just google Grog.
Travis: I needed it right away. Right, right.
Liam: I'm also seeing, why did we switch from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition?
Matt: I answered that a second ago.
Liam: Oh, you did?
Matt: Yeah, the idea being that the reason we switched was it was easier for large-scale combat, and the system was a little more simplified, and I felt for such a large party it'd be easier to do. Plus character creation for any guests we have in the future, so that was the main reason. I love Pathfinder, but at this size, it's good. Answering your earlier question too, I saw someone ask, a good party size. Legitimately, my preference is between four and six players. This works because they're amazing players, and because we keep it very freeform, and not getting bogged down in minutia too often. The four to six players I think is a good sweet spot.
Marisha: I see, does Keyleth have limitations on what animals she can transform into? Yeah, for the most part I can only transform into beasts and I have to be under a certain challenge rating. So right now, at my level, I can only turn into beasts that are a challenge reading of three or lower.
Matt: A third of your druid level, right?
Marisha: Yeah, a third of my druid level which is nine right now. But for the most part I can change into almost anything as long as it's under a challenge rating of three.
Matt: Pike, how do you feel about Scanlan? Do you return his affections?
Ashley: Oh, well. I'm on the fence about him. He's really pretty great, but I don't know. I'm not really sold yet.
Marisha: You know Pike, I feel like we haven't actually girl talked about this.
Ashley: I know, we never girl talked about it.
Marisha: We should.
Ashley: I know, we should talk. I just, I really like him, I think he's really funny. I really the fact that he's a musician, but.
Marisha: That's hot.
Ashley: I don't know, I'm not really sold on him yet.
Marisha: I'm just concerned if he could treat you well.
Ashley: Oh no, you know what?
Marisha: He's got bad habits.
Ashley: He likes to frequent brothels and things like that, which, you know. I'd wanna give him his freedom and his space. I don't know if I'm into it.
Taliesin: If I say it so you can understand it, what's the point?
Liam: Someone's asking if we like presents. I think we'd all like fan art.
Matt: Fan art's awesome, we love it.
Liam: Immortalize our shitheadedness, that'd be good.
Marisha: Oh, it's true.
Ashley: Another couple people on there were asking about my ears. And I really like supporting small businesses. And there's a store on Etsy called Tiny Tangerines, and she makes these by hand. And makes like deer, and bears, she makes a ton of stuff.
Matt: That's really cute.
Ashley: Check her out.
Liam: We still got that little one. Socrates asked what was a favorite moment before we started streaming the show? Our first game was pretty amazing.
Marisha: Our first game was great, I've got some good memories from that one.
Liam: Most of us, I was giggling uncontrollably, I couldn't believe we were doing it. And just watching my friends, who I work with all the time, just dropping into character, there was no like, oh, let's see, what will I do, what am I doing? I will move, I will roll. Like Bailey, Bailey dropped into character from the get-go, and was a ringer. But the moment I was thinking of was when Pike died. Pike died.
Matt: Like died died.
Liam: Shortly before we switched from private to public. It was emotional. A couple people started crying, I teared up. We put two and a half years into this, and we're all very connected to it. I'm not gonna get into it, but I've had a hard couple of years personally, everything's fine, but this was like therapy for me. And to see one of my friends go down?
Ashley: It was sad.
Liam: It was fucking emotional.
Marisha: I don't think a few people were crying, I think everyone was crying.
Orion: I was crying.
Ashley: I was definitely crying. I was like, "no, I love doing this so much!" I don't wanna, I mean, when you spend that much time with people, over two and a half years, you get so attached, and attached to characters.
Marisha: We know these characters almost as well as we know each other now.
Matt: Factoids, the tower you made for us in Minecraft is awesome. Seriously, well done, look at the pictures, it's great, we're gonna have to actually go through it.
Marisha: Wait, we have a tower?
Matt: A guy built an entire tower for the group.
Ashley: No way!
Marisha: They built a castle Greyskull?
Matt: Essentially, on the Geek & Sundry Minecraft server. No. Wait no I did see that! It was huge.
Zac: It towers over the entire --
Liam: Of what?
Matt: Of him! Someone made a sculpture of--. Did you make that or somebody else? You made that?
Zac: Oh no.
Matt: Okay, somebody else made it for you.
Liam: Do we have $50 in the budget to go on eBay and get a Castle of Greyskull set? Put it on the set somewhere? Let's do that.
Matt: There we go. I see a couple quick questions.
Orion: To answer your question, there is an origin of Tiberius, fully written. I won't say it all right now, but he comes from a political family, and there's a whole bunch of layers to him. He is a thought-out character. The buffoonery is half-planned.
Marisha: I mean, we're all really deep, thought out characters.
Orion: Well, they asked if I actually thought out a story for him. He does have a thing for this character named Allura.
Matt: Yeah, Arcanist Allura, the one that actually sent them on this mission, he has kind of a thing for.
Orion: She's super awesome. Hot, I think she's hot.
Matt: She's pretty hot.
Ashley: Super hot.
Matt: The gunslinger class info, I actually posted on Twitter a few days ago, it's in my dropbox if you look through my Twitter. It's on there, otherwise, we'll probably put it up on the website, when all the website stuff is up there. I'm happy to release it now. It's pretty balanced, it's fun. Might have some tweaks down the road, depending on how things play out. You should go to my Twitter, you'll find it there.
Travis: We're gonna have a website with all our characters.
Liam: Yeah, we're working towards that.
Matt: Working on it, yeah. Like a lot of things right now, it's a work in progress.
Liam: Someone asked what kind of food would everyone like?
Orion: Ooh, like Thai food.
Liam: I like Indian.
Matt: Ooh, Indian is good.
Ashley: I really noticed--
Zac: Let them know not to order food.
Liam: Don't, that's a terrible idea.
Orion: We just had a bunch of chicken.
Marisha: Oh you mean like right now? Yeah, don't do it right now.
Zac: If you tell them what you want, all of a sudden I'll get a call, like, "your food is on the way!"
Marisha: Yeah, no, not right now, maybe next week.
Travis: Matt, you're going to Wizard World in Philly. But we will not be joining because we don't own a private fucking plane.
Marisha: But I'll be there. Is anybody else gonna be there?
Travis: Oh really?
Marisha: We'll be there.
Liam: Somebody asked something, like, what do we hope is the result of this show? I can't remember the wording. Obviously we're doing this because we love each other and we're having fun together, but I also hope, D&D has been, its entire history has been like, "oh, it's this weird thing that guys do with dice in a room." Anyone can do this, I love video games, I work in video games, but D&D has changed my life. It is social, it is person to person, it is real, because it's people in a room doing shit together, and that's kind of lacking a little bit in our world, and I would say find some friends. I mean, I love that there are sort of online tools to play with people across the country, but if you can find three or four people in your town to do this, I'd say do it. Do it.
Travis: Yeah, do it.
Marisha: There's something really amazing about the fact that we're all essentially kind of building and communally developing a story together, and that's something that not a whole lot of things can grant you, and we don't really get in today's society much. We're all kinda creating this as a thing. And I think it's good that we're like, hey, this is socially acceptable. D&D's cool, everyone should play D&D.
Matt: Actually, the IT Crowd episode of D&D is one of the best on camera examples of a D&D game night thing.
Orion: That is an awesome episode.
Matt: Fucking hilarious, and a great, truncated version of this is kinda what the game is. So good on you.
Orion: Cut to them weeping.
Taliesin: So many questions going so quickly.
Matt: I know.
Ashley: I want a Grog shirt that says "do it."
Taliesin: And the kitty shirts were an accident. This was not planned.
Marisha: Oh yeah, our kitty shirts.
Liam: Someone's saying what edition to start with? I would start with the most recent, because you know they're gonna keep updating it over the years.
Matt: Fifth is great, Fifth is a great entry point.
Liam: It's really loose. I feel like all of us felt like, we were doing Pathfinder, and... Fucking loved it, otherwise we wouldn't be doing it, but it was really intricate, and we were doing it every six or seven weeks, when we were off-air, so. We felt like the rules were really complicated and we'd lose track of it. We loved doing it, obviously, but Fifth Edition is really fast and loose. I recommend that. And Travis just stuck his finger in my ear, he kinda does that. He hits me in the nads a lot.
Matt: This is a homebrew campaign. I wrote it all just kind of for the hell of it. Custom, don't really base it on anything existing. I feel like I'm playing more in that world, and I always hate the idea of, in the middle of DMing, having to go to a module, or having to look for a rule that wasn't my own. It feels more detached. There are modules that are great, and I've run great modules, but for me personally, with the pacing, and the flow of the game, I prefer to do homebrew.
Liam: Connected to that, someone asked, if you had any tips, and I'd like to know the answer to this too, because I'm running a game for my eight-year-old son and his friends who are about to start, do you have any tips for new DM's?
Matt: Yes. Let's see. I could do a whole panel on that. Tips for new DMs. Preparation is important. You wanna outline cities, come up with ideas for NPCs, that you think would be essential to a story, or like people that really run elements of the town. Simple notes can be like, they're this race, this is their disposition, if you have a particular voice you wanna try for, make a note of this kind of voice. So whenever you come back to them you have a reminder. And spend a lot of time building that structure, you don't have to be too detailed. Always leave room to play in the world, because you never know what your players are gonna do. Be prepared to improv. I prefer loose preparation, and then just kinda rolling where the players take you.
Liam: Although you wrote a monologue for Clarence, right? Because that was very intricate. We were all just ready--
Ashley: Yeah, there's no way you just thought that up.
Matt: There are certain elements, part of the notes I take is for certain NPCs I'll write down key information that they know, and depending on how you ask them, what you say to them, and what you try and extract from them, they might give you some of the information, they might not, if you coerce them, or intimidate them. Or if they're willing to give up the information, I have all that written down. So for that information today, you guys were asking him, and since you allied with Clarence, he was willing to discuss with you. So I had all that prewritten, but depending on how much you said, it was what you guys asked.
Liam: Do you have random encounters ready, in case we're like, "ah, fuck it, I don't wanna go down to the dungeon, I wanna go back up and beat up some dwarves." Do you have shit kind of ready?
Matt: Yep. I have a stack of different creature and encounters already prebuilt, based on what you guys may encounter. Tonight was an example of players being able to pick what happened. But also it's one of those things where it depended, I don't know where you guys are gonna go. I present a story, I present an idea of a general throughline, but how you guys go from point A to point B, that's entirely up to you. Sometimes that can be a very long, meandering line, sometimes it could be a direct ray, so.
Travis: There was a question, how much do you improvise, and when is it appropriate to improvise?
Matt: A lot, and always.
Marisha: Always, yeah.
Travis: The answer is yes.
Matt: I've had whole games where I've prepared a session, and none of it happened, because people just put an entirely wrong direction. Not wrong, but a different direction. So the whole game was just me pulling everything out of my ass.
Marisha: Like that time we walked through the back door of the Thieves' Guild, that was fun.
Matt: Yeah, there was that.
Marisha: What's up, Thieves' Guild. 'Sup.
Orion: Donkey Kong, Pikachu.
Travis: What?
Orion: Somebody asked me what my favorite Smash Brothers character is.
Travis: Oh.
Liam: Somebody asked how we pick the character class that we picked. When we first started this game, and I said, "hey, it's my birthday, I wanna play a game." Laura really likes rogues as well, but I made sure that as fast as I fucking could.
Travis: She was pissed.
Liam: So she, yeah. She plays rogue, in like Dragon Age and everything. That shit's a favorite class of hers, so I know I got it out there. Also, the reason that we're twins is because Laura and I have the exact same birthday, May 28th.
Ashley: I didn't know that.
Marisha: I didn't know that either.
Liam: That's why we're twins.
Marisha: That's cool.
Ashley: I knew-- I came in late to the game, and there were only a couple options left. And I had never played, so. I picked gnome because I was like, oh, that's funny. And then cleric, I didn't really realize what a cleric was. And how detailed it can be if you've never played. And important to the game. So when I started I was like, well shit, this is a little tougher than I thought it would be. But it's been awesome, I love being a cleric.
Liam: I'm so glad we pulled you in.
Ashley: Me too, man, me too. Oh, also, someone asked, who is Pike's deity. And it's Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, among other things.
Matt: Which is carried over actually from Pathfinder. Fifth Edition has its own suggested, there's never a definitive pantheon. But they have the deity pantheon. But we're carrying over Pathfinder deities that were prominently in the campaign up to this certain point, because why the hell not? We're not gonna make her change her deity, that would be weird.
Marisha: Travis, how did you pick your character?
Travis: What? Oh. I asked what the biggest playable character was, I think. One that liked to fight, drink, and fight.
Liam: One of the greatest pleasures for me, and I'm obviously a huge nerdlinger, and this is just me reliving high school. When I was talking to Sam about starting all this, and saying hey, let's get together, it's what I wanna do for my birthday, we pulled Travis in, Travis is fucking tight, look at him. He's not the stereotypical D&D player, and he was as snake bitten as the rest of us. Play Dungeons & Dragons, please play Dungeons & Dragons.
Travis: It was so good.
Ashley: It's the best.
Liam: It'll make you so happy.
Orion: What about you? Keyleth?
Marisha: I remember at the time I had a, we were playing another campaign, and I had like a rogue assassin, that you were in with me. And I had a kind of assassin character who was super seductress, and really high charisma. And I remember when I joined this game, I didn't really know any of you guys really all that well, and I was kind of new to this world, so I ended up going with a kind of druid, and I kind of deliberately made her introvert, in a weird way to kind of reflect my newcoming to the group, but I was like, "whoa, it'll be like I can be quiet." so Keyleth has a really low charisma, but I kind of spin it in that she's naive, and doesn't really know. And that's why she says things like, "but Clarence." (all laugh)
Marisha: "You're just special." Because she's naive, and kind of quiet. So she was just different than anything I've played before. But I really love being a druid. Druids are great.
Taliesin: I played a lot in school. Other than Matt, I probably had the most experience playing D&D, and playing roleplaying games.
Travis: Yeah you did. Genius.
Taliesin: So I was really excited by the gunslinger in Pathfinder just 'cause it was something I hadn't done before. So I found it the most interesting and unusual, but I was not, and I also felt it was a hole within the group that could be filled very well.
Liam: Thedouginator keeps asking you, Matt, how you brought the party together the first day of play.
Marisha: Wait, we haven't heard Tiberius' story as sorcerer. Then we can answer that question.
Orion: When this was going on, I asked Matt if there was a caster yet, like any glass cannons, and he said no. So I debated between a wizard and sorcerer. When we went over the different mechanics, how a wizard and a sorcerer works, I was more drawn to that. And I'm a huge RPG guy.
Liam: You're so entertaining.
Orion: To piggyback a quick question, to seal off the Tiberius thing, somebody asked if any of our voice acting influences our characters. Tiberius, absolutely. I played Elminster Aumar in the Neverwinter MMO. Which is a D&D MMO. And when we started this I'm essentially doing Elminster, but I made him super bubbly.
Taliesin: No, someone asked how the group, yeah.
Matt: We got together, first session, essentially, was in a swamp town named Stillben, and the group at the time had, for their own separate reasons, been in this town, needing money, and had kind of come together as a mercenary group out of necessity. So the first session was them having known each other from a circumstance where they all ended up helping out an individual in the city, long story short, they had a small rapport, and knew at least each other were useful, and needed cash. And there was a job board in the town. So the first session was them being hired to look into a conspiracy within this swamp port town, Stillben. That was their first real adventure together. And when that finished, they kept going from there.
Orion: Uh, troll penis story.
Ashley: Troll penis. (all laugh)
Marisha: That's fair.
Orion: I know you guys keep asking.
Liam: Take it away, Mercer.
Matt: There was a battle. Subterranean battle that involved the party sneaking upon a group of two trolls that were around a fire. The idea to work past this came to Tiberius to transform himself visually into a female troll so he could Bugs Bunny them. Hey boys, you know, that thing. Not knowing the temperament of trolls, especially ones that are deep underground, and don't get to see female trolls very often, they immediately just got extremely aggressive, and he found himself almost between a rock and a hard place.
Orion: I was getting raped by trolls.
Matt: The party then descended upon these trolls, and in the middle of battle, at numerous times, I believe Percy once and Laura the other, both took specific shots at each troll's dick. Rolled a good shot with enough damage to blow them off. Now being a troll, they regenerate. But it was still a good effect, and when the battle was over, it was decided by the party to at least take one as a trophy and place it in the bag of holding.
Travis: That was decided by me, thank you.
Matt: By Grog, and as such, it stayed for a while, until it was used as an implement of distraction in another encounter I believe.
Travis: It worked.
Matt: Yeah, it worked. That was where troll dick came from.
Orion: It was spitroasting.
Liam: Jake Bodro asked what's it like playing for three hours in front of 2,500 people? I think our games have gotten a little bit better, only because when we play privately, there were sometimes lulls, where we weren't sure what to do, we would go off to bathroom, we would take a break. But now there's a little bit of the element of theater to it. Just a sprinkle of it. And it kinda of gooses the energy up.
Orion: I'm doing the same thing for the record.
Travis: I keep seeing this one. For the 11 year old Sadie, the son of Odin shall have that cookie!
Matt: Aw, that's sweet.
Ashley: There you go.
Matt: There is one bag of holding in the group, and Grog always has it.
Travis: A troll dick and a bulette tongue.
Matt: There are many things that go into the bag.
Travis: It hasn't gone in that bag.
Taliesin: Is there still a cow in the bag?
Travis: No, Dork the ox.
Matt: Dork the ox is probably not.
Travis: That's when we first learned its limitations.
Matt: Why does Scanlan have so many awesome spells? Bards in Fifth Edition have one of the options they can choose. As they level up, can choose a couple of spells from any spellcasting class, which is great, and the boon that bards kinda needed to be more combat-effective. And you can choose the School of Lore or the School of Combat, I think, for the bard. He chose the School of Lore which allows you even more spells from other classes to boost your repertoire, so he became a fucking amazing bard.
Liam: Also, Sam Riegel did a lot of a capella in college.
Travis: He did, he really did.
Liam: He helped write several seasons of The Voice, which was all about a capella, so Samis sort of a ringer for the bard class.
Matt: Yeah, kinda had to happen that way.
Travis: Can Marisha do her dwarf impersonation?
Marisha: Nope.
Liam: Yordee yorda--
Marisha: Yorda youree yourdee yourd.
Ashley: Someone asked if Grog could keep one of his women in the bag of holding. You can't put living things in the bag of holding.
Taliesin: As we've learned.
Matt: You can.
Marisha: With Dork.
Matt: They just die.
Travis: There's no air, it's like a vacuum. A magical vacuum.
Matt: Dork the ox did not survive.
Travis: One giant dead ox came out of the bag.
Liam: Someone keeps asking if any of us have hirelings, or henchmen, and the simple answer to that is no.
Matt: That's not true.
Liam: Just Trinket.
Orion: At our Keep.
Taliesin: We do.
Liam: Oh, that's right!
Travis: Yeah, we battle-tested them.
Orion: We have a Keep back in--
Liam: Right before we started.
Travis: The game before we came here. After they saved the kingdom of Eman, the sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, as part of his gift to the group for essentially saving his family and the city itself, had a Keep constructed for them, and took about six months or so, and the Keep was finished, and then the party's first session was them finding who they're going to hire to take care of the Keep for them.
Liam: It was like one episode of the Sims.
Matt: Kind of. It was great too, 'cause Grog's whole idea of making them to see who would be the better hire was to break the pool cue and be like, "who survives?" Make them fight, it was pretty great.
Taliesin: For Tone17, I played a modified Malkavian, and a Smetty if you can believe such a thing, which was badass.
Matt: There you go.
Liam: We've been playing for two and a half years. Someone wanted to know how long.
Taliesin: Oh my God, really?
Travis: Did we tell them about your podcast with the recording of the very first one?
Liam: If you want, Sam and I, it's kind of languishing, but we have a podcast together called AllWorkNoPlay.
Travis: It's amazing.
Liam: We're both parents, we have kids, so we have no time to do anything. Enough time to take a shit. The first or second episode, the first episode is about us playing the first game, and there's audio from the first game. Again, go to iTunes, or to AllWorkNoPlay on Pod Bean, and you'll hear about two minutes of us dealing with a puzzle that Matt threw at us.
Marisha: It was timed.
Liam: Yeah, it was timed, there was an hourglass going off. It was us discovering D&D really for the first time. AllWorkNoPlay, all one word.
Marisha: Actually one of my favorite stories that I tell all the time is about you, from our first game, 'cause if you remember, I didn't play. I just kinda helped Matt help you guys. I was like a D&D minion. And I remember I was helping you, and I remember you were like, "So, if I just wanted to go up and punch those guards, I could do that?" And I was like, yeah, well you would go up, and you would punch them, and then Matt would tell you how you'd do that. And then you went like this, you were like.
Travis: Computing.
Marisha: Yeah, you were like, "so, we can do anything?" (all laugh)
Marisha: And I was like, yeah.
Liam: Taliesin on game one was actually not Percy, he was a dragonborn paladin?
Taliesin: I was a dragonborn paladin.
Liam: You fucking blew our minds, we were like, "what do I do? Can I do damage points to stop this puzzle." There was this tunnel with all these moving parts, we thought we were gonna be crushed, and he was a dragonborn for the first episode. It's in the recording on the the AllWorkNoPlay podcast. And he just breathed ice on this water-based--
Taliesin: Contraption.
Liam: And froze it, and everyone was like, "you can do that? You can't just roll dice and hit it?" And that's when we kind of understood oh, it's whatever the fuck you want.
Taliesin: That was such a good game for learning the basic mechanics. Such a well put together game.
Orion: Matt does control the music while we play.
Matt: Yes, I have playlists. They were much more broad playlists before, unfortunately on the stream, we have to use only approved royalty-free music, so it took me a while to figure it out previous to this.
Travis: I do miss those Madonna songs.
Matt: I know. I used to play a lot of Bush.
Marisha: Hey, would that count as fan art? If fans made us music?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Could we then use that? Yeah? He's nodding.
Zac: They can send us whatever they want.
Marisha: Some consent forms? Yeah.
Travis: If one of your characters died, would you roll a new character?
Orion: Music people out there.
Marisha: Any music people. Anything atmospheric.
Liam: No, no, that's an important question.
Travis: Ignore it.
Liam: No, it's important. Someone's asking, if we die, would we roll in a new character? And plus, we just started this show, so part of us were wondering like, what if we die the second episode? What happens? We recorded this opening to the show that's coming.
Matt: So here's how I run the world. I feel that one of the problems in some RPGs is that death becomes flippant when magic allows you to completely undo it. In my campaigns certain powerful spells like Greater Restoration, Resurrection, things like that are a challenge, meaning you can definitely undo death, but a lot of it is based on your capabilities as a spellcaster, your attachment to the people you've been traveling with. So if ever a character does die, a resurrection can be attempted, but it is a challenge. Which means there's a possibility of it failing. In which case, if the resurrection fails, the soul is lost, the character is permanently dead. The player then can leave and never come back if they want to, but they have the option to create a new character, and be reintroduced to the campaign like half a level lower than the rest.
Ashley: That would suck so much.
Liam: When Pike died we had, all of us, many series of dice rolls to do, and it was very story-based.
Marisha: Yeah people are asking how she came back.
Liam: Yeah, I mean, luckily we were in a big city, there was a huge temple. There were very wise clerics who were good at bringing people back. But still, we all had to roll. There was three rounds we had to roll, he might have fudged numbers, I don't know. But we were all still scared. We had to all, the majority of us, had to have good rolls three times in a row. Scanlan had to put--
Travis: The tears of three women in the room.
Liam: The tears, Scanlan had to kiss her on the head, he put a figure that he carved of her, it was very elaborate. This one was majorly in tears. Laura was in tears.
Ashley: I was in tears.
Taliesin: Laura was hyperventilating.
Orion: And when that was going on, I remember, when that went off, being still Tiberius, I was like in half character but half not, and I was not crying, I was like, (grumbles) the whole time, and as soon as she sprung back to life, because the cleric--
Matt: Breathed in her first breath after that.
Orion: We luckily, because I know it was a tight roll.
Matt: It was a very tight roll. It was a DC of 14 in the final roll, and because Scanlan brought out this figure of her that he had carved for her like two months beforehand as a gift, sets it down and kisses her on the forehead, and it was kinda the final connection point. He needed 14, he rolled a 12, but, because he-- There's a plus two modifier to the skill check, being a bard, and that was what he needed, he just made it. Basic, basic--
Liam: Someone's asking if we drink while playing, and the answer is no. (all laugh)
Travis: It's just water in those tankards.
Taliesin: Coffee.
Marisha: I almost did, yeah.
Orion: When she came back to life is when Tiberius, I was like, "oh my God, she's okay!"
Ashley: I think also having-- Because with magic and everything like that, just bringing somebody back to life so easily, since we don't have that as much as maybe other games-- It's heightened, so every time someone gets hurt, we're all, I think now, after having that death, all of us are like, "where are you at? Where are you at?"
Orion: Where are you going? I wish I could turn to Sam, but he's not here.
Ashley: We're all so stressed out now, which is, it's kinda cool.
Matt: Mortality's a real thing you have to deal with, and up until Pike's death it was kind of a thing people weren't considering. It just happened so suddenly.
Liam: One I see keep coming up since we started is how would we react to life if we were our characters? I don't know, or differently from our characters? 'Cause I wouldn't stab my children when they frustrate me.
Matt: I'd be in a padded room. (all laugh)
Marisha: I feel like everyone tries to make decisions in a game that their character would make in real life, 'cause that's kind of the point. I take into consideration that I have shitty charisma, whenever I open my mouth. I feel like we all try and take into consideration our background and our alignment, because that's, you know.
Taliesin: I feel significantly more badass than my character.
Orion: I feel... Tiberius is just me with magic. So that's how I feel.
Travis: Grog was easy, he makes bad decisions, which is just all that I do.
Matt: Pike died when they were fighting what was called a treachery demon, or a glabrezu, which had basically infiltrated the Sovereign Uriel, and the city of Emon. And when it revealed its final form, it got one lucky critical hit on Pike when she was too close, and just instantly took her out. That's how she died. Someone's asking if they can (laughs) send us equipment we need for the show. Zac.
Zac: Yeah, they can.
Matt: What do you need?
Zac: We'll put it on the wishlist.
Matt: There you go, it's on the wishlist.
Orion: There's a wishlist?
Matt: I didn't know there was one, but now there is.
Zac: Castle Greyskull on there.
Liam: How do we feel about Team Demihooman, and inspiring them to play D&D for the first time? I think the number one reason we all wanna do this is because we love each other, and we love this game. The second thing is we all knew, we kind of felt like-- We're gonna make Dungeons & Dragons cool again.
Matt: Try at least.
Liam: And make it open for anyone to do, there's no reason not to do this. If there's someone you know who doesn't understand it, don't worry about it. Just find some friends and connect with them.
Matt: I find one of the difficult things is explaining to somebody who has never played an RPG, or a game of D&D at all, they're like, "how does it work, what is it?" And it's hard to explain, so if anything, now we have an example with this show. Other than the IT Crowd episode, or the Community episode, which are both great examples for quick little succinct things.
Taliesin: If we had the power to bring one guest player for one session.
Orion: Oh, that's easy. Tom Hanks, for sure. (all laugh)
Marisha: Mazes and Madness.
Zac: Everyone is asking for you guys to somehow get Vin Diesel.
Marisha: I was gonna say, Vin Diesel.
Orion: He lives for this shit!
Matt: Vin Diesel's good. Top of my list is Stephen Colbert, because I know he also plays.
Ashley: That would be amazing.
Taliesin: I would love to see Joss Whedon do this. I admit I would like to see Joss Whedon play D&D. That'd be interesting.
Zac: That might be possible.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm throwing that one out there.
Orion: What, Tom Hanks isn't?
Marisha: Felicia's got some.
Matt: But he's also a super fuckin' busy man.
Orion: Guys, tweet at Tom Hanks to come play with us.
Travis: I'm Morgan Freeman, and I rolled a one.
Matt: Right now, Critical Role Hanks. See if we can make it trend. Patton Oswalt would be great.
Orion: That'd be hilarious.
Zac: What about Dan Harmon, just so I can get fired, can we do that? (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah. Hardwick used to play D&D with Patton Oswalt in the mid-2000s. I can't even imagine what those games were like.
Orion: I'd like to like-- Amy Poehler, I'd like to have one of those.
Zac: She might be open to that. She's a partner with Legendary.
Orion: I'd love her, Tina, Tina Fey.
Liam: Someone keeps asking about Troy, I don't know if Troy Baker is ready.
Orion: I don't think he's ready for this jelly. You guys think he's ready for this jelly? I don't think so.
Matt: Whenever it comes up in conversation, Troy always gives me that look of like... "All right."
Travis: You can see him swimming in the infinity of--
Marisha: "That's not cool."
Liam: He has some preconceived notions.
Marisha: "My scarves are cooler than you."
Matt: Once we get him like a proper plus two enchanted scarf.
Ashley: Can we ship Grog and Vex?
Travis: Grog and Vex. No, I'm here to annoy Vex by smacking her bear around, and she's here to tell me not to kill myself. "Don't jump into the crevasse, it's 1000 feet deep."
Ashley: Troy Baker is Pike's distanced dad. (all laugh)
Matt: That's pretty funny.
Liam: Answer this question I like, I saw it a couple times, how did you guys get involved in streaming for Geek & Sundry?
Travis: Virgin sacrifice.
Matt: The best way I know that happened was, we had been playing for a while, and we all work in the industry. People began to hear about our voiceover D&D game, weirdly. Like I'd come into sessions with directors I've never worked with before, they'd be like, "Oh yeah, you're the guy that runs that D&D game." How did that happen? How is that my thing? I'm cool with it, like heck yeah, my little high school self is like, I'm okay with being known about that. But then over time eventually Geek & Sundry contacted us. Felicia had heard about it. They called me in for a meeting, and we spent a number of months trying to figure out what format we were gonna try, if we wanna do it like multi camera, filmed canned episodes, then eventually the Twitch possibility came up, and we were like no, this is a much better format for us. And that's kind of how it happened.
Liam: Are you kosher with me, you took this film, there's a video of you breaking the news to us that Geek & Sundry came to you about it. Are you kosher with me sharing that video?
Matt: Yeah, I don't see why not.
Liam: All right, I'll find a way to put it through my Twitter. So just keep your eye on my Twitter.
Ashley: Wait, what are you sharing?
Liam: There was a video that Orion took when Matt told us about Geek & Sundry coming to him. And us all sort of toasting and laughing.
Orion: Reacting.
Liam: Giggling like idiots.
Matt: Why is D&D Pathfinder making you so much more attached to the characters than a regular RPG? If you mean like a video game RPG? I mean you get attached either way, but with this, because you are so much more fluid, with how you can influence the world, and the character, and the way the character reacts to the world and how it can influence it is so much more--
Marisha: Personal.
Matt: Personal, a good way of putting it. It's just that much more involving, and you invest so much into that atmosphere. And it depends on the group, some people just like to do dungeon crawls, and kill and get loot and experience, and that's totally cool too. For me at least. I like 'em both for different reasons. I still play the crap out of video game RPGs.
Liam: Someone asked if given the chance, would we like to do a live game at a convention like Acquisition Inc.? I'd like to do, although there's nine of us, so that'd be kind of--
Ashley: That'd be a long game.
Zac: We may be asking you guys to do that soon.
Liam: Oh good, then yes.
Matt: As long as you're handling the tech, I think we'd be fine with that.
Liam: I'd like to do it.
Zac: We may be streaming from Comic Con, I don't know. We may be asking if you guys are gonna go through that hell hole.
Liam: The answer is yes.
Orion: Can we get a jib? I like crane shots.
Marisha: Ooh.
Ashley: A helicopter? A helicopter shot.
Orion: Put it on the wishlist.
Zac: Put it on the wishlist, a jib.
Liam: How many of you aside from Matt have run a game of D&D or another RPG? In high school I ran a D&D game, I ran a Rifts game for a little while.
Matt: Rifts, yes.
Liam: I ran a cyberpunk game for a little while.
Travis: Really?
Liam: Yes. The last two months I have been helping my eight-year-old son and two of his friends from school create characters. And I wouldn't have done this if Matt had not forced this shit into my life. I wouldn't have done this, but I'm about to start running a game for my son, the half-elf druid, and his two friends, the dragonborn fighter, and the dragonborn rogue.
Travis: What if they die?
Liam: That's just how the cookie crumbles, motherfucker.
Travis: Oh man, you are teaching life lessons.
Marisha: Gotta teach lessons.
Travis: Go Fish and then D&D.
Taliesin: I ran a Rifts game as well in high school. Then I ran a game of Vampire the Masquerade, and I was in a bunch of them.
Liam: Of course you did.
Taliesin: Couple rounds of Paranoia, and Hole, because that's funny. Hole was amazing.
Matt: Which you gave me books for. For my birthday, which was awesome.
Marisha: I was a part of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer tabletop RPG for a while. Yeah, it's actually quite fun. I was a pyromancer.
Orion: Somebody asked a fun one, they asked if we play, what's our favorite video game?
Marisha: What's our favorite video games? Oh that's a hard question.
Orion: Is it?
Marisha: There's so many!
Orion: Well we can skip it.
Liam: Metal Gear, Dragon Age.
Ashley: Probably Portal, Portal or Dragon Age.
Matt: Portal's great.
Liam: Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, I played 'til I had blisters on my thumbs.
Matt: Symphony of the Night, yeah, dude. What is a man?
Taliesin: Borderlands 2, and I'm happy--
Ashley: Borderlands 2.
Liam: Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64.
Orion: Oh shit.
Liam: Baldur's Gate, which I played again on my iPad a year or two ago. Somebody, oh go ahead.
Orion: I was just saying.
Liam: Somebody asked how we focus in the room with the sexual magnetism that is Scanlan Shorthalt.
Ashley: Ooh, it's tough man.
Liam: I don't know.
Taliesin: I wear a codpiece. I wear a codpiece that keeps everything in check.
Matt: I'm heavily sedated most of the game, just for that reason. Otherwise the clothes would just come right off.
Liam: I just let myself get a gigantic boner every week.
Matt: Does anyone play League? Generally.
Marisha: Sometimes. We're playing Heroes of the Storm more now.
Orion: I'm a big Final Fantasy fan. I like all kinds of games. I definitely would say if I had to pick one RPG, cause I'm an RPG guy, I love Chrono Cross, that'd be my favorite game. I've played that more than I have Chrono Trigger, which is way too many times.
Travis: Dragon Age race/class. Ash, anybody that plays?
Matt: Elf rogue.
Taliesin: Human fighter.
Travis: Always the mage.
Liam: Travis, stupid question, Thor, Odinson, or Hulk, in a knock down drag out?
Travis: Oh (scoffs).
Orion: Type-0 also, dammit.
Travis: Contractually, Thor, realistically, Hulk. I mean I am Thor, I can't say any other guy.
Taliesin: Hulk's on a scaling power level, 'cause he just gets too mad.
Travis: Yeah let's just be real about that. That's Hulk.
Matt: Tried new Final Fantasy yet?
Ashley: ChocolateSweets a bunch of times has asked would you guys consider cosplay for the games?
Taliesin: Well technically. We already did.
Marisha: You'll see, maybe next week?
Matt: He's trying the best he can. We have an intro coming up some point soon.
Zac: Halfway done.
Matt: Halfway done, we all shot loosely in character costumes inspired by everyone's characters, so you'll be able to see that soon.
Taliesin: If anyone would like to make us costumes.
Liam: One man doing it all.
Travis: A million arms.
Ashley: I think it would be kinda hard for me to play the game in cosplay, 'cause I have probably the most armor now.
Matt: You do. You wear the most armor.
Orion: That's a cool question. If you had to switch characters Matt, if you had to switch characters, which one would you be?
Marisha: If you had to trade places with one of us?
Orion: Yeah, if you would switch characters.
Zac: That question was Matt included, question was for everyone, if you guys could switch characters with anyone, who would you pick? Including Matt.
Ashley: I would probably switch with Liam or Travis.
Taliesin: Tiberius would be mine, I'd take Tiberius.
Liam: Scanlan, I would be Scanlan.
Matt: I would be Scanlan, bards man. Bards are my favorite class.
Marisha: I'd be probably either Scanlan or Pike.
Travis: I'd be Trinket.
Matt: Yeah you would.
Travis: Why are you peeing on everything?
Marisha: Bards and clerics are great.
Orion: I'd definitely be Grog. Just the complete opposite of what I can do.
Taliesin: I'm a WoW player on occasion, I haven't played in ages.
Orion: For the Horde.
Matt: Player wants to play a lizardfolk monk, what's my opinion about the idea? That's fine, I mean a player can play whatever they want to, as long as you as the DM want it in your campaign. Just make sure they have more to their character besides "I'm a lizard monk!" have a good reason why they trained as a monk. If they make a cool personality behind it, work it into the social structure of their lizardfolk people, and see whether the monks will be shunned or accepted, are they an outcast of the society? Think of those ideas, and make a cool character based on the story, from a fighting standpoint? That'd be cool. I used to play a lizard monk in Ruins of Kunark back in the old EQ days. Oh man. That was a while back.
Liam: Someone asked when Trinket came into the mix. Day one.
Travis: Day one. She had that shit like that. She knew she wanted a pet bear.
Marisha: He hasn't died yet.
Orion: He hasn't died, it's amazing, this thing has not died. He should have died so many times.
Matt: She spent all of her character focus in having a pet from combat, and then never puts it in combat, because she doesn't want it to get killed, and it's fucking hilarious.
Travis: We put it jeopardy situations before.
Matt: Yeah, you have. Every time she goes, "never again!" And I'm like, all right, well.
Taliesin: The day that bear dies, it's gonna get ugly.
Ashley: It's gonna be bad.
Orion: It's good to change her, as a character.
Travis: Alignment shift.
Taliesin: So much black to wear.
Marisha: Douginator asked me a super detailed question. So I don't wanna blow over it, 'cause it was awesome. He asked me how my path has gone, and my personal Aramente journey, and how working with the group has helped and slowed it down. For the Air Ashari and for Keyleth's journey, it's kind of expected to take her maybe ten, maybe 20 years? It takes her like, the Aramente is expected to take a long time, and part of it is her kind of proving herself a hero. So she kind of ended up tagging along with this motley crew in order to kind of help her so she's not doing it alone. So it's a good thing that she's tagging along. But she also has to deal with sometimes the moral dilemma of maybe choices that she might not normally make if she wasn't with the group that she has to go with.
Liam: I see two questions I wanna address. One is what is each of our favorite kill?
Orion: I was gonna say that was a good one.
Liam: And the second one is what's the story behind the Super High Intensity Team? (all laugh)
Liam: Let's start with the kills, and then we'll get to the SHITs. My favorite kill, I finished off a blue dragon we faced. We all chipped away at this dragon, someone who had disguised himself as human for a long time, then we came to their secret cubbyhole, and they revealed themselves. We chipped away and chipped away, then at the end I sort of parkour-ran up a wall and shoved the daggers into its neck, and just slid down its entire body and finished it.
Orion: My favorite kill is actually--
Liam: Until today.
Orion: When Pike kicked the bucket, and that moment all of us realized what happened, and there was an instant shift in real emotion, where whatever the hell, I don't even remember who we were fighting, because I went like, fucking cast this, and everyone's just, kill this thing, because we all cared so much in a real life situation, where we hated this thing, with real emotion, and we just slaughtered it.
Taliesin: The demon-possessed royal family was my favorite.
Liam: That was the same thing.
Taliesin: Yeah, that was my favorite fight. Just using the light, also we were shooting, I was getting to shoot holes in the glass.
Matt: The entire throne room had a glass dome overtop, but because the family had been possessed by the shades, these shadow entities, it was all covered. They were able to force these spirits out of the physical bodies without killing them by being able to tear off the cloth or shoot holes in it to allow sunlight in and use that as part of the battle tactic, it worked out really cool.
Marisha: Yeah, that was fun.
Travis: My favorite kill wasn't even an enemy, it was when Scanlan summoned that pony, when we were facing those five wizards. (all laugh)
Travis: He summoned this pony, and then I turned and abruptly cut its fucking head off, and reached in and grabbed its organs, and smeared its gore all over myself, and started screaming. And Mercer was like, "okay."
Orion: The fight ended there.
Matt: Roll intimidation, with a bonus.
Travis: Butchered a pony for intimidation.
Matt: Yeah, it worked.
Marisha: I think one of my favorite Keyleth moments, it wasn't a kill, but when we were in the crazy, Michael Jackson, Neverland Ranch, sorcerer dude's plane of existence.
Matt: The Dread Emperor.
Marisha: Yeah, when we were in his plane of existence, and we encountered that big tree rock monster, and I just happened to take Command Plants, and he happened to be a plant monster, so it just worked out perfectly, and I was just like, "we don't wanna fight you! back down." and avoided an entire battle.
Taliesin: Getting the magic carpet was also pretty badass.
Marisha: Oh yeah, that was a good story.
Liam: Another fabulous moment that you guys have to know about is we wanted to get into a tower at one point, and there was a very intelligent sort of right-hand man to whoever owned the tower. Scanlan just started fast-talking, which is his defining characteristic. Took his finger and put it right here as a mustache, and said, "hi, I'm Burt Reynolds." (all laugh)
Liam: And he rolled, either Scanlan rolled a 20--
Travis: I think it was a natural.
Matt: He rolled a natural 20.
Liam: And you weren't expecting it to work, in any way, shape, or form, and you went, "okay."
Travis: Mr. Reynolds.
Marisha: Burt Reynolds just announced that he's gonna be at Philly Wizard World with us, so we could theoretically tell him that story.
Matt: I have to.
Ashley: Burt Reynolds would be a dream guest.
Orion: Him and Tom Hanks.
Travis: He'd have to play on a bearskin carpet.
Matt: The whole family history organized.
Ashley: I've only had one kill.
Travis: But, it was what?
Ashley: And it was a dragon.
Travis: Yeah, dragonslayer.
Ashley: But the thing that I, probably the whole battle with the family that was sort of possessed when I actually died, that was probably one of my favorite battles. Maybe not after I died, prior to. When I got to finish off the dragon--
Taliesin: Was that on Christmas?
Ashley: The dragon? Yes. That night was so amazing because we had, we made it a winter festival. So we all came in our pajamas. It was close to Christmas, that's why it was a winter festival. It was like our little Christmas party.
Marisha: Our holiday episode.
Liam: That was sad for me because it was my idea but I had health problems at the time and I had to bow out, and I was very, very, very sad.
Matt: But you made it to this year's. I made it the following year, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, we had a whole little thing, it was really nice.
Matt: I would love to play D&D with Dame Judy Dench.
Marisha: Heck yeah.
Matt: You guys can tweet at her so you can get her to agree.
Liam: The SHITs. How did we become the SHITs?
Matt: Yes. So the party had run into a, debearded, actually, shaven dwarf named Grimthorn, who wanted to represent them for, what is occasionally, a roving brawling guild, essentially. Like underground fighting rings that happen around the world at different points throughout the year. It may come up again, we'll see. But they had to think of a team name. And Scanlan. Recommended the Super High Intensity Team. Which stuck for a while, so the group name, against the better judgement of, I think, a lot of the group, became The SHITs. So their name for a while was The SHITs, they were announced as The SHITs in the ring, when they won the tournament. That was when the pony was cut in half, to intimidate the opposing team.
Travis: Scanlan's idea also.
Orion: Tiberius and Keyleth were not happy.
Matt: SHITs stuck for a while until eventually they got rid of the SHITs, as all of a sudden they were about to go to the winter festival parade in their honor for saving the entire city of Eman, and the Sovereign Uriel said, "what should we announce you as?" and it was decided not to announce you guys in front of the city at your parade as The SHITs.
Ashley: I was super into it. Still love The SHITs.
Matt: Instead the name became Vox Machina. So if you've heard them say that, that's the official team name they've created for themselves as a group.
Orion: With credit to Sam as well, which was voted down was also the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood. Which I was a huge fan of. I really wanted it to be the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood. But Vox Machina sounded cooler.
Ashley: The Brotherhood of the Sisterhood of the Order, or something like that?
Marisha: The Order of the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.
Orion: So Tiberius recognizes as the Vox Machina/Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.
Liam: LargoSensei keeps asking, what are your most cathartic voice acting experiences? I'm gonna guess for Ashley that's The Last of Us, since that's your fucking heart ripped out of your chest.
Ashley: Probably, yeah.
Liam: Gollum was pretty sad for me, because he's a miserable bastard. Also Angel from Wolverine, the X-Men.
Orion: Wait, does cathartic mean sad?
Liam: Well it just means get your fucking demons out. Chew it up.
Taliesin: Mine's really old, it's probably either Monster or Paranoia Agent. I'm gonna go that far back. Yeah, all the way back.
Matt: Fate Zero for me had a moment that was pretty intense emotionally, that I really enjoyed.
Travis: Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic. (all laugh)
Matt: Sonic Boom, yo.
Marisha: Boom, Sonic Boom.
Travis: What's that?
Liam: Infamous, maybe?
Travis: Oh, yeah.
Liam: Pretty fucking sad.
Travis: Brothers. Brotherhood. Brotherly love.
Orion: I'd say for me it was doing Type-0. Not so much the actual lines, 'cause I had a lot of fun. I don't know if that's cathartic, but. Completing an actual real life dream goal. I've said this a couple times before, but the last day I was recording the last stuff, I was literally crying on the way home, because I finally got to level myself up. And this thing kept it up, and it was really cool.
Travis: Matt, who were you in Fate-0?
Matt: I'm Kiritsugu, Kiritsugu Emiya.
Travis: Bless you.
Matt: Thank you. That's the dark assassin character.
Taliesin: Saw a question about Percy's home, and his family. Percy has a really really big family, that I don't mention in the video, and he has not been home yet. He has no interest in going home yet, 'cause that's terrifying. So we have not dealt with that.
Matt: That's going to be interesting when that comes around.
Travis: What's under the freakin' lake?
Liam: What's under the freakin' lake, Matt?
Marisha: Yeah, what's under the lake?
Matt: You were told.
Orion: Yeah, it's one of those big--
Matt: Aboleth.
Marisha: Oh yeah that's right, I did write it down.
Matt: Which you encountered one underground.
Marisha: Yes, I was a shark.
Matt: Put the slime into the water. You could only breathe water and couldn't breathe air.
Marisha: Remember, 'cause I was like, "I'm gonna be crafty and turn into a shark," and then I started immediately drowning.
Orion: How do you keep players from getting OP, Matt?
Matt: Make the monsters more powerful.
Orion: Behind the scenes, I'm always constantly up his ass, trying to make Tiberius as OP as possible, and he's always stopping me a lot.
Matt: Balance is important. I mean, the characters, everyone here has really good characters that have a lot of cool abilities, but they also have a lot of challenges that come at them that make them, not only use those abilities, but also, monsters can have cool abilities too.
Liam: Bracheon89, you said Stephen King plays D&D?
Ashley: Yes, that's what I was trying to say. What?
Liam: Bracheon, we're going to wait for your answer. How do you know he plays D&D?
Ashley: Are you sure?
Liam: Let's get him in here.
Matt: I'd love that.
Taliesin: The group's worst decision in D&D was the dragon, I think.
Marisha: Oh yeah, Grog?
Taliesin: Grog.
Travis: Listen, there was a shitload of gold.
Ashley: I still don't think that was a bad idea.
Orion: Oh, when he started hoarding all the gold?
Marisha: We still don't know if that--
Liam: Takes a lot of stupid.
Marisha: He might have been an ally. We might have killed someone who was valuable.
Taliesin: You were still freaking out like a month later, you were feeling really bad.
Travis: Well, I did almost get us killed.
Ashley: I feel like it was a good decision.
Matt: To be fair, it's the only time I've ever had a player rage loot before. (all laugh)
Matt: You went into a rage, and used it to just loot more. And then the dragon revealed itself, and you looked at it, and you just kept looting. (all laugh)
Travis: You guys take care of this.
Ashley: That was hilarious.
Matt: That's Grog.
Liam: Somebody keeps asking, and we'll do a show of hands here, Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones?
Ashley: Oh, come on.
Marisha: Ooh, that's tough.
Liam: What do you prefer? 10 seconds to think about it, and then I'll--
Taliesin: That's like Star Trek or Star Wars.
Marisha: Yeah, hard.
Liam: They're asking the question.
Zac: Don't be afraid, come on.
Travis: That's tough.
Liam: Lord of the Rings, fuckin' Lord of the Rings. There you go, there's the answer.
Ashley: I don't know, man.
Taliesin: Lord of the Rings, but I see Game of Thrones on the side.
Liam: I love Game of Thrones.
Marisha: Of course we do.
Travis: Lord of the Rings.
Taliesin: We wouldn't have Game of Thrones without Lord of the Rings.
Marisha: That's the thing.
Liam: Maybe possibly not Dungeons & Dragons without Lord of the Rings.
Ashley: This is true, it's the OG. I don't know what that even--
Taliesin: You said that. That just came out of your mouth.
Ashley: Please let's leave it alone. Moving on.
Travis: That's the OG.
Ashley: What is this, what do we have over here? Well, who was the old gnome that Grog saved in his intro video?
Liam: Pike's daddy.
Ashley: No, that was my great great grandfather.
Travis: That's right.
Ashley: Yes, great great grandfather Wilhand.
Travis: Wilhelm, hand? Wilhand.
Ashley: That's right.
Liam: Wilhand the money.
Travis: Grog has an intelligence of six, he's gonna get names wrong from time to time.
Liam: Everybody, if you could choose whatever fantasy world to live in, what would it be?
Travis: Marvel.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Orion: I would live in the... Next Generation world, universe.
Taliesin: You had me at Marvel.
Travis: Yeah.
Zac: Here's the thing, you could live in Marvel what you live in, if you couldn't live in that world as a superhero, just as a normal person.
Travis: Right, not in New York. Anybody that lives in New York in the Marvel universe is just stupid. Like rent's gotta be $1.50.
Taliesin: Terrible idea.
Matt: I'd say Myst. So I can just write my own worlds to infinity from there.
Liam: Lord of the Rings.
Matt: Or Amber as well.
Ashley: I was gonna say Lord of the Rings. Maybe Rivendell.
Marisha: I'm gonna say Final Fantasy 10.
Matt: Grey Havens. If you're gonna do Lord of the Rings, do Grey Havens, 'cause you're far enough away from Mordor, where it's generally not gonna be a problem.
Liam: I wanna be one of the Fellowship. Ashley Johnson lived in a Marvel universe already, right?
Matt: That's true.
Orion: See, and it's a big hassle.
Marisha: It was a big hassle.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Before the stream, our D&D session--
Marisha: High insurance rates.
Matt: Before the stream our D&D sessions would happen once every month to month and a half, more like month and a half.
Liam: Why is Matt Scarlet Witch?
Matt: I'm down with it. 'Cause I alter reality. Power makes sense. Our sessions used to be once every month, or month and a half, and they would be about six to eight hours. But the problem is we'd play so infrequently, every session I'd have to remind everyone what happened, and it was hard to schedule. Part of the reason we're even doing this show, is because it's technically work, which allows those of us who have families and children more of an excuse to come more often. So yeah.
Liam: Googoo17, Arkazey keeps asking, what's your favorite nerdy t-shirt you own? Mine is one that says Mordor World Tour, it looks like a rock 'n' roll t-shirt, but it says Mordor World Tour.
Marisha: That's cool. Favorite nerdy t-shirt.
Taliesin: I've got a Sons of Anarchy Doctor Who t-shirt, I'm a really big fan of. I'll wear it next week.
Marisha: I've got like an army, kind of soldiery, looking t-shirt that says Chimera, like Chimera Corps.
Matt: That's actually the one I was gonna say, that's my favorite shirt too.
Marisha: I like your displacer kitty you've got.
Matt: Displacer kitty's kind of cool. Adorable.
Taliesin: I like your shine on me shirt.
Matt: Oh God. If you guys haven't watched. Chris Dane Owens, on YouTube, Chris Dane Owens, Shine on Me. It's a music video, watch it. Chris Dane Owens, Shine, or Shine on Me, YouTube, do it.
Taliesin: I love that you own the shirt from it.
Matt: I bought a shirt from it, 'cause it's that amazing, I had to.
Travis: Did anyone tell Pike that Scanlan killed the naga for her?
Matt: I don't think someone's done it yet.
Liam: Scanlan had his first kill. You saw it, right?
Matt: You saw it on the stream.
Ashley: I saw it, me, Ashley saw it, but Pike did not hear about it yet. Who knows, that could be the thing that seals the deal. I'll be like, you killed the naga? Okay, let's do this. (all laugh)
Marisha: Any betrayals in the game?
Matt: No betrayals, disagreements, and occasional--
Travis: Trippings and beat-downs.
Matt: And stealing of flying carpets.
Ashley: I actually did step, I kind of did hurt Liam one game. Or Vax.
Liam: The game we played together? We did just the two of us one night.
Ashley: There were some of the girls changing in a room.
Matt: I forgot about this.
Liam: I was very curious to see you naked. But that's kinda fallen on the wayside.
Ashley: Vax was very curious to see what a gnome looked like naked.
Liam: Never seen it before.
Marisha: So you did a little peeping tom?
Liam: Why wouldn't I wanna expand my horizons?
Matt: So he rolled stealth.
Ashley: So he rolled stealth, and he did, and saw or whatever, and then when I came back out, and I found out about it.
Liam: Looked good, it was compact.
Ashley: It was just a small human. And I think I stepped on your foot, and gave you some damage.
Liam: Maybe a hit point.
Ashley: Yeah, a hit point or two.
Matt: You earned it.
Ashley: I earned it.
Orion: Somebody, seagullblaster--
Liam: No, Vax didn't spy on Vex, sorry, go ahead.
Orion: Asked-- Tiberius said something about the Palestone, and what it is, and this is, somebody asked a different question, this is kinda gonna answer both. I, and everybody else, wrote backstories for Matthew to essentially give him so he could construct our universe. Tiberius' particular quest is looking for particular artifacts. Essentially I made him like Mulder. Nobody believes in the city that these things exist, except him, so the truth is out there kinda thing. So I made up these five different artifacts that do different things. And I don't know what they do until I might maybe find them, and if I do, it's up to him, to Matt, to determine what they are, if they are anything. They might be nothing, I don't know. I've found one item so far, and it's awesome, and all of us have given him bits and pieces, and that's how he constructs our story with things that you throw in yourself.
Matt: Yeah, and each player, all their story lines work into the world. Not all of them will happen immediately of course, some people have had personal encounters and story encounters already, some are yet to occur, and there will be points throughout the campaign where the party will probably have to move and individually deal with each person's story to some extent.
Marisha: Dealt a little bit with each person.
Matt: Touched a little bit like-- In Eman, we've seen Vex and Vax's father.
Liam: Vex and I ran into to our father again for the first time in many years, it was a little frosty.
Matt: Had a new family.
Liam: Have a little half sister.
Travis: Matt, you have a favorite voice? And does it hurt to do the gnarly monster voice?
Matt: If you do it for an extended period of time it can be kind of shitty.
Ashley: I don't know how you do this new one.
Travis: Breathing in and out.
Liam: That's inward singing, man.
Travis: It is inward singing.
Liam: And then I'm fucking singing, and then--
Matt: Actually, it's funny, a bunch of my NPCs that I've done since high school have ended up turning into characters I've booked. I'll go into an audition and be like, "I'll go ahead and do Nutibe Curios, from my Second campaign," and I'll end up doing that character. Alof in Pillars is a character I NPCed back in high school.
Liam: That's awesome.
Taliesin: They still haven't heard my favorite voice from this campaign yet. 'Cause we haven't gone back to the city yet.
Matt: Oh, Gilmore?
Liam: Gilmore is a wonderful magician who owns a shop.
Orion: Was that the fancy--
Liam: Yes, in the city of Eman, he's got a big friggin' crush on me, and wants me. Wants me and some day you and I will actualize that.
Matt: We'll have to roleplay that.
Liam: Maybe in a game. Maybe not.
Travis: What do we think is taking over the hive mind?
Matt: What do you guys think is taking over the hive mind?
Marisha: Well we know it's named--
Orion: Obviously some butthole.
Ashley: I think I might have an idea.
Travis: Yeah, you had a vision that we don't even know about yet, right?
Ashley: Well.
Travis: Taking those mushrooms, having those visions.
Ashley: Taking those mushrooms.
Liam: Someone asked how do game devs find us for acting work? We all audition, hundreds of people audition, for every role in Los Angeles, we all just try. Today I worked on a superhero game, and the guy who was directing me for voiceover said, "hey, so what are you doing for the rest of the day?" And I said, well, I'm gonna go to the gym, I'm gonna do this, then I'm gonna go do that, do you know about that D&D show that a couple of us are doing? And he's like, "yeah, I heard about that." And the guy who had written the game went, "yeah, I've watched every episode." (all laugh)
Matt: So awesome.
Taliesin: That's so cool.
Ashley: Someone wants to hear Gilmore's voice.
Taliesin: I think we should save that for, wait until they actually meet Gilmore.
Travis: Yeah, we can't give it away.
Matt: Gilmore's a fun one.
Ashley: Gilmore's awesome.
Matt: Gilmore is very Broadway. He's very--
Taliesin: Not the gargoyle.
Matt: No, no. I could see him being a character in a John Waters film.
Taliesin: Oh my God, yeah.
Ashley: Totally.
Liam: Give him a pencil-thin mustache.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm trying to catch up.
Travis: Greater overall motivations?
Matt: That may or may not be secret, depending on the characters.
Marisha: What is each person's favorite D&D monster?
Travis: A dead one.
Liam: I liked it when Grog got it on with a, what was it, a nymph?
Travis: What?
Matt: Yeah!
Travis: You don't know man, I went through the portal, handled my business like a champ.
Liam: In the air.
Travis: I don't kiss and tell. Nobody knows. I got what we were supposed to get.
Liam: A nymph could have attacked us, but Grog looked her in the eye, and she liked what she saw. Then he disappeared for a little while, and he came back and he was in a really good mood.
Travis: I flashed her the look, man. She was mine, what can I say?
Taliesin: I like the little green gelatinous cubes. I think they're fun, and then if you make 'em right, you can just make 'em out of jello, and eat them when you're done, that's awesome.
Matt: I don't wanna answer that question necessarily, because I might be using them in the campaign at some point.
Orion: Which one?
Matt: Nothing.
Ashley: So that means we haven't used 'em yet.
Matt: But overall, I just love the tarrasque because it's like the game ender. It's the godzilla. It's the one DM's move where he's like, "I'm done with this campaign, hey guys, you're gonna fight a tarrasque, either you're all gonna die, or you beat it, and you beat the game!" So the tarrassque is always fun.
Orion: Is it the final boss?
Liam: I've always been fascinated with the mind flayers. You're fucking throwing an army of them at us. 'Cause they're dangerous.
Matt: Yeah, they're terrible.
Liam: And they're so outside of the norm.
Matt: And hey you stealthed up, and pretty much killed one in one round today.
Orion: That was insane. When the mud on the face, and the stab in the fucking back of the head.
Matt: You guys black ops'ed that entire barracks.
Liam: I'm proud of the knife.
Taliesin: I know what you're talking about.
Travis: Grog and Scanlan have no bastard children, that we know of. Or that you can prove.
Liam: Other streamed D&D games, like Rollplay hosted by itmejp?
Travis: No.
Liam: No. Maybe we will, though.
Orion: I won't.
Liam: Everyone play Dungeons & Dragons.
Ashley: My favorite NPC character is a little butler who I think became--
Travis: Yes!
Ashley: He's the cutest little thing you will ever see, and I think now he works at--
Taliesin: He works for us now.
Matt: Yep, you guys hired him, and he's currently helping keep your Keep in good shape.
Ashley: What's his name?
Orion: The old fellow, right?
Matt: I'm trying to remember, I'll have to go look at the list again. I have so many NPCs, I have a hard time.
Ashley: He's just the sweetest little thing you ever did see.
Matt: Grog's flatlined intelligence, anything like that happen before? That was the first of that type of situation.
Travis: I went unconscious once 'cause I fell, how far did I fall?
Taliesin: Wow, you fell.
Orion: Oh, that was a crazy one too.
Matt: They were there fighting in an underground cavern, and at the very, very top of this giant, like 170-foot ceiling, which they had all kinda floated up to, and put a rope, anchor in.
Travis: I was ready to Toro the bull.
Matt: The first umber hulk you guys ever encountered, ended up pushing Grog out of the hole, bullrushing him. Had the rope tied around his waist, but unfortunately Grog weighs about 600 pounds, rope snapped, and he took enough damage to go from full health to unconscious and bleeding out in one round.
Marisha: 'Cause he confused you, right? And you just hari-karied off the hole?
Travis: I was gonna dodge and be all awesome, and say ole or some shit, but I was just out.
Marisha: That was when I was a spider tiger. 'Cause I cast Spider Climb on myself, and I was in tiger form, so I was spider climbing all over the place.
Matt: That's also one of my favorite risky rolls, which was after that happened, Tiberius, you pushed the umber hulk onto the ground, or through the hole, it fell.
Orion: I had this amazing spell with Pathfinder called Aquasphere, orb, and you can like, capture large creatures. I literally can waterbend a sphere and carry this dude and drop them down, it was amazing, I miss it so much. Continue the story.
Matt: So essentially Tiberius decided, 'cause Grog was unconscious, and the creature was down there. All of them were stuck 170 feet up, in this little hive essentially. Tiberius said fuck it, he jumped out of the hole, swan dove down, and cast Featherfall on himself at the last minute, had to make a concentration check because of the wind rushing past, and having to cast a spell while falling. It's a very difficult thing. He had about a 40% chance of success, 60% chance of instant death, and he made the roll. I love risky moments like that so much, I love 'em.
Travis: It was pretty legit.
Orion: I did it again and held that fucker, it was intense.
Marisha: I'm wondering when we're gonna face a beholder.
Matt: That'll be nasty.
Marisha: That's my favorite D&D monster.
Orion: With all the eyes?
Marisha: They're like a big floating head with a giant eye, and they've got tentacles, with eyes on the end of 'em, and each eyeball does a different ray of effect.
Travis: A beholder?
Matt: Nasty.
Travis: You know what that is too?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: They're nasty.
Ashley: Bad news bears.
Marisha: They're super awesome. One of these days we're gonna fight one.
Matt: One of these days.
Liam: They're a signature character of Dungeons & Dragons. They represent D&D.
Travis: What made the dwarves get bigger today in the battle?
Matt: That's actually an ability of the duergar.
Liam: Viagra.
Matt: Yeah. They can summon through sheer force of will, and just the way they've been bred over time, they can increase their form for a short time to increase their damage, and be just a general asshole, so. It's an ability the duergar have.
Travis: Long lost son.
Liam: I'm gonna guess that none of us have been to Sweden?
Matt: I have.
Ashley: My dad was from Sweden.
Matt: That's awesome. I've been to Gothenberg.
Taliesin: That's not surprising.
Orion: I have not, but I would like to go.
Marisha: Yeah, who wouldn't want to go to Sweden?
Liam: Makes sense. Pale and blonde.
Matt: Have you been?
Ashley: Never been.
Matt: It's beautiful, I spent two weeks in Gothenberg, Sweden, on business years ago. It was gorgeous. Food was amazing. Nothing like walking down the street and seeing a giant gothic stone structure with an archway and a gargoyle perched, and you walk in and it's a 7-Eleven. It's pretty hilarious. All the architecture there is old, but it's been repurposed, it's great.
Liam: If you had to choose would you pick to receive an extra level, or Matt's hair?
Matt: God damn it.
Liam: Matt's hair. (all laugh)
Ashley: Hair, obviously.
Marisha: Receive an extra level or Matt's hair.
Travis: You can't get hair like this without unicorn blood. My God.
Matt: I'm gonna shave my head one of these days.
Liam: Shave his head, he can't DM anymore.
Matt: I'd wither. It's like Sampson. I would just like become this little raisin, I'd be David Tennant.
Liam: The beholder strikes for the-- mawp. Mawp.
Matt: Let's see. What are the questions we got up there?
Marisha: It is 11 38, by the way.
Liam: What is the most outrageous and unexpected thing to come from a natural 20? That was Scanlan.
Ashley: Probably the--
Liam: Scanlan as Burt Reynolds.
Marisha: Oh right.
Matt: We'll take about five more minutes of questions. Five or ten more minutes of questions, then we gotta take off.
Liam: How long will you be doing this show? 30 years.
Matt: Considering we've been playing for two and a half years, and everyone's level nine, we can keep going for quite some time. Whether or not we continue past that, means either we do a new campaign, or we go into epic or mythic levels? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I mean, I'd love to keep playing for as long as people wanna play, but also people get busy, life changes, we'll see how it goes. I'm in for the long haul as much as everyone else is.
Liam: Matt, multiple people are asking what the music is that we're hearing on the show.
Matt: What you hear in the show is a combination of a gentlemen named Kevin Macleod, who has a website called Incompetech, which he produces really amazing, royalty-free musical tracks. I've used them for many web series for many years. He's very talented, and I contacted him, and asked him permission to use on the stream. He's like, "yeah, anything on Twitch, go for it." And the other half are a lot of soundscapes I use from a company called Platemail Games, which make great custom RPG soundscapes, and some tracks that are just creepy, and dwarf cityscapes, and dark forest night. It's a great, great resource. Those are my two big ones for this Twitch stream.
Orion: And yes, we did roll for our starting stats.
Matt: Yeah it was 4d6, drop the lowest, arrange as desired. So it was a powerful campaign.
Liam: What was the most nail-biting moment the group has seen? It was Pike's death.
Marisha: Pike dying.
Matt: Definitely. Do you prefer being the DM, or do you like mixing it up and being characters? I never get a chance to play games really. It's kind of one of those, always a DM, never a bride circumstance.
Liam: You wanna play with my kid?
Matt: Yeah. I'll be an evil character and murder them all, you're going to regret it immediately, make 'em just cry.
Liam: "Listen, that's the game, suck it up!"
Matt: Yeah, turn it into Mazes and Monsters.
Taliesin: Is that why you play so much War Machine, is because for once you don't have to be responsible?
Matt: Probably. I occasionally, I got to play a game of Diaspora for a while, with Philip Eisner, the guy who wrote Event Horizon. So playing a sci-fi kind of horror-based universe with him running, that was great. That was very brief.
Liam: Matt, can you give us any teasers of things to come?
Matt: No. See as they happen, man, that's part of the fun, the mystery of it all. I know what's coming. I got stuff planned for years. It's gonna be fun.
Liam: Do you have any advice to get into voice acting? Learn to act, study acting, go to where the work is, keep acting, in anything, in fucking anything. Go to where the work is. Act.
Matt: What age did you play your first tabletop RPG game? For me it was Second Edition Dungeons & Dragons, and it was freshman year of high school.
Taliesin: GURPS, 13. I was, yeah, 13 years old, GURPS.
Ashley: Favorite tabletop games, not D&D?
Liam: Get Hulk Hogan to play.
Orion: That's not D&D?
Taliesin: Mansions of Madness.
Marisha: Mansions of Madness is great.
Orion: Is MTG, Magic the Gathering a tabletop? Is that considered tabletop?
Marisha: It's a card building game.
Orion: Magic.
Marisha: War Machine.
Matt: War Machine is really fun.
Marisha: I'm a Cryx player.
Matt: It's awesome.
Ashley: I'm just starting.
Matt: You're the awesome Retribution.
Orion: I'm Circle of Orboros.
Taliesin: We played with Scanlan, of course we do.
Travis: It said do you ever think about sexuality while playing, besides Grog, of course. Scanlan does, I'm sure other people have.
Taliesin: It's hard not to think about it with Sam.
Travis: We just pay for it.
Liam: Are we gonna release more background information of your campaign?
Matt: Yes, actually.
Liam: We are?
Matt: Time has been hard, but I'm trudging through. What I'm gonna make essentially is a video recap of the previous two and a half years of the campaign. I'm gonna narrate it, it's gonna be very simple. It's gonna be just information, with the occasional slides of stuff in the background. But I'm working on a video, kind of like your guys' intros, that'll be a synopsis of the story up until this stream stared.
Travis: Claymation, that's awesome, man.
Matt: I will destroy you, I will fucking stab you.
Liam: If you want, it's not much, but I have a Vine account that's under the name VoiceofOBrien, and I took a lot of Vine videos from our private game. So it's not a ton, but you'll see us acting like shitheads.
Travis: That's seven seconds at a time.
Marisha: Seven seconds at a time, yeah. I think I still have the video of you trying to woo the nymph lady.
Travis: Try?
Taliesin: That was a good video.
Marisha: It's basically just you flirting with my boyfriend.
Taliesin: I have some videos of the tarot game, and a couple of us
Travis: Matt is now a nymph.
Matt: Yeah, we sat there, and, hey man, I've had to flirt with quite a few of these people as characters, it's interesting.
Liam: Who's your favorite NPC that you brought to life for us?
Matt: Oh, that's a tough one. There's been a lot of good ones. I really enjoyed Grimthorn, the dwarf that was--
Liam: Clarota is pretty good.
Matt: Yeah, Clarota is great. He was the one eyed dwarf with the shave, that was taking you guys to the fighting ring. He was fun. I'm enjoying Balgus as well, he's a good one.
Marisha: Ballsack.
Liam: Ballsack.
Marisha: Do we have nicknames for all of our NPCs?
Matt: You know, I really enjoy Arcanist Allura Visoren.
Orion: So do I!
Matt: She's an awesome, powerful, headstrong elven sorceress, who is part of a, not a secret, but a very powerful circle of magic practitioners around the world, and also a member of the council of Tal'Dorei. She's one of the largest allies that this group has had through a lot of the adventure arcs, and I love playing her, she's great.
Liam: Grog, have you even thrown a gnome as an attack.
Travis: The very first time we played, I picked up Sam and chucked him across a room. That was full of a trap.
Marisha: Fastball special.
Travis: And it worked. It was awesome.
Matt: What character type would I play if I ever got a chance to play? I would probably be a bard. I wanna make a bard that actually conducts the battle. Meaning, sits there and watches the fight, and he's conducting, like music happens when other people attack. Cymbals go off, and drum beats, and all of his abilities are tied to music, so he's actually conducting the battle like a symphony. That's what I wanna make.
Marisha: That's cool.
Ashley: That's badass.
Matt: One day.
Liam: Would you ever play an evil character? My contingency plan, if I get killed, I don't know about evil, but he won't be as nice as Vax.
Matt: Evil characters have to be discussed with the DM. I'm iffy on the evil character, unless they have a good reason, and a personality that isn't going to completely derail the campaign. Doing an evil campaign, that's fine. But if you're building a character that is going to inherently be a troll, and basically diminish everybody else's good time in the story, it becomes a problem.
Zac: It's the internet though, man.
Matt: I know. If you make a cool, interesting evil character, that can be evil but still like, like a good example would be in Baldur's Gate, Edwin.
Zac: What if one of your guests, that came on for one night, would they be allowed to be?
Matt: Yeah, they'd be allowed to. They may not survive.
Orion: Tiberius might not--
Marisha: Or kill them.
Liam: I don't know about evil, but if I have to come back, I might be a lot more selfish.
Matt: In it cool news, tabletop columnist, offering to DM a game for me. I may have to hit you up on that some time. 'Cause that'd be awesome.
Taliesin: He deserves a break.
Zac: How do you remember all the voices that you've done of the NPC's over the years?
Matt: I make notes and audio files.
Travis: You do?
Matt: I do. As a reminder in case I forget.
Travis: Jarvis. (all laugh)
Matt: I have notes written next to every NPC, like an accent or dialect that I chose for them, a general texture. Kind of like what you'd see for breakdowns for a character you're auditioning for. I basically make that for each NPC to remind me of what I've done. And if it's a particularly weird voice that I don't know if I could replicate in the future, after the session I'll go and do a little audio file of me doing the voice so I can go back to it later.
Travis: You're a freak of nature, man.
Taliesin: Seriously.
Matt: Good question.
Marisha: There's a lot that goes into it. I think Matt, just to put it into perspective, for everyone in the chat room, I think Matt probably spends close to eight hours, at least, on each time before we play. Or I guess at least we used to.
Matt: For our big session, I'd spend as much time preparing as we did playing. I'll put it that way, I spend as much time preparing as we play. So for these sessions, I'm spending about three hours a week, preparing, what, three to four hours a week? For old sessions that was bigger.
Liam: Someone asked, what was the reaction to discovering you had a magic flying carpet? Which you can see if you go to Matt's YouTube channel. There's a video that Ashley made of us playing, and you see our reactions to that.
Marisha: Who was it, was it you, or Vex? That tried to float down with the carpet, and then we realized it was magic?
Liam: Yeah, underneath.
Marisha: But we tried to just use it like a parachute.
Matt: It was a crumbling tower, it was Allura's tower. You guys went into, realized she was missing, because the tower had been attacked. You set off essentially a defense system of her arcane tower, which caused it to crumble into a tiny pearl.
Orion: Tiberius jumped out the window and just cast Featherfall.
Matt: Yeah, and just kinda glided away. You turned into an eagle and grabbed the gnomes. The rest of the party had to try to rapidly escape a crumbling tower that was compacting on to itself.
Marisha: I think it was mainly the twins in the tower.
Liam: Hey, Grog almost died once. He fell from a great--
Matt: You fall a lot, but when you fall on to something, that thing is fucked.
Matt: All right, we're winding down here, 'cause we gotta leave here shortly guys. Two more questions.
Liam: Three more questions.
Zac: Closing messages before you guys go, too.
Matt: Oh yeah, all right, so we'll do a couple more questions, then we'll go to closing messages. Who wants to pick?
Liam: Let's make it a magic three.
Marisha: Let's do a good one.
Matt: Three, three questions, make 'em quick. Let's see.
Marisha: Waiting for a good one.
Matt: How much does Grog weigh? Grog weighs approximately 600 pound we decided.
Travis: Just under 700.
Matt: So he's kinda rough.
Travis: It's all muscle, bitch.
Matt: Yeah it is. Muscle and brains.
Travis: Muscle and wang. 500 pounds and a hundred-pound wang.
Matt: Any of you consider running a game for fans of the stream? Actually, I've run a couple games at conventions for some groups. I had a couple of sessions I ran, actually in conjunction with Wizards, they sent stuff out for us.
Taliesin: And for charity.
Matt: Yeah, we've had some charity D&D games out here in L.A. So we've done them before. I'd consider it if there was time available, and a venue that allowed it. So if it does happen, we'll definitely announce it here.
Travis: Best item in your inventory?
Orion: That's for a magic item?
Travis: Oh, did we already say that? I'm just blanking.
Orion: No.
Taliesin: It's hard to read this quickly.
Matt: You guys have some good questions.
Travis: My brain's turning into applesauce.
Ashley: I know, me too.
Liam: Do you realize how lucky you all are to have such a nice group of friends?
All: Yes.
Matt: Very much so.
Taliesin: The world is cold and unfeeling.
Liam: Let's close it on that. I love these guys.
Matt: And I like to think that this is, because there are so many good people out there in the world, and we were lucky enough to find each other through weird circumstances. And there are so many good people in the world out there, don't close yourself off to it. You'd be surprised how many awesome--
Travis: How long does it usually take the woman in the back to tie her boot?
Marisha: I'm multi-tasking.
Matt: No, that's the question we end it on. That's the question.
Marisha: I've just been tightening my laces while I've been kicking it back here.
Zac: I'm gonna squeeze in here really quick. So I have some thank you's I wanna call out while you guys are here. I figured they'd appreciate me calling them out the most while you guys were on screen. 'Cause they like you guys for some reason.
All: Aw.
Zac: So these are all people that have sent us stuff off Amazon, to help make the studio better. So Danielle Denny.
Ashley: Thanks Danielle!
Matt: Danielle, thank you so much Danielle.
Zac: Bradley Dealman?
Marisha: Dalman.
Matt: Bradley Dalman.
Liam: Do we know what they sent us? Can you tell us some of the things they sent?
Zac: I have, I-- Well I mean they're like-- new microphones for that station and lights.
Marisha: That's amazing.
Zac: Wii controllers.
Matt: Brad, thank you, that's amazing.
Zac: And other stuff for tech we needed that we didn't have. Shane and Russell said thanks for all your hard work, and everything you are doing.
Matt: Aw. Thank you Shane!
Zac: Ty Odlinger.
Ashley: Ty!
Zac: Timothy B. Hudson.
Ashley: Timothy!
Zac: Timothy B. Hudson, he went nuts.
Matt: Timothy!
Taliesin: Triple threat.
Zac: Kathel T. Stockdale.
Ashley: Cool name, Kathel.
Zac: Yeah, that's rad. Luis Archuletta.
Matt: Luis Archeletta!
Ashley: Luis!
Zac: Steve Chua.
Matt: Steve!
Zac: Here's a little something to help you guys out. Another one from Chua, here's a little something to help you guys out. And I know there's more coming in, this is what we've got so far. Thanks everybody.
Matt: That's so cool guys, thank you.
Zac: And they also have asked that a couple of you guys come on Honesty Hour sometime.
Liam: What is that?
Zac: It's a show I do on Monday nights, where it's 100% no-holds-barred. I will answer any question that they ask.
Travis: What?
Orion: I would love to do that.
Travis: Sounds like a horrifying idea.
Zac: Okay, they've asked specifically for Ashley, they've asked for Matt, and as for, actually I think everyone has been asked at one point in time. So I'll say maybe I'll have you guys once a month.
Ashley: When is Honesty Hour?
Zac: It's usually Monday nights from nine to, whenever the fuck. Like it went to 1:30AM the other night.
Crew: Isn't it really an Honesty Time?
Zac: Don't do it! It's only for subscribers. It's not that bad, because they ask really great questions, a lot of them have been about how have you gotten through certain aspects of depression, or what kind of thing--
Marisha: Oh that's good.
Zac: It's pretty inspirational.
Liam: How many times have you been hit in the nuts in your life?
Zac: I can say twice. And would probably explained how it happened, and what I did. It's just story time. Sometimes the questions get a little inappropriate.
Matt: That's okay.
Zac: That's fine.
Matt: But like for the most part, the audience here's been so awesome, they're all super intelligent with great questions. I'd be down, I'd totally be down.
Ashley: Wait, is this Noncompliant?
Zac: Yeah.
Matt: Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, I got the Noncompliant tattoo this week, actually.
Marisha: Oh yeah, I saw your picture.
Ashley: That's amazing.
Zac: We have a comic book show on Tuesday.
Travis: (air-horn sound)
Zac: Real talk with Zac. But thank you guys so much for doing this. The subscribers really wanted to do it, so hopefully you guys enjoyed as well. And we will come back next week.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Yay!
Zac: Tomorrow, if you guys are at Wonder Con, are any of you guys gonna be at Wonder Con?
Taliesin: Saturday.
Marisha: I don't know, maybe.
Orion: I'll be there Saturday.
Matt: I'm sadly not gonna be there.
Zac: I will be there tomorrow from 12:30 to one, for a meet and greet, which I'm going to pretend is an autograph signing, and I'm going to bring my own pictures.
Matt: Yeah!
Zac: We're gonna have fun with it. Going in costume. Becca and I are going in costume, and then Hector and Ify will be at four. And then Hector and Ify are doing a Q and A, or no, a trivia game that night on the stage for Geek & Sundry and stuff like that. So Geek & Sundry will be there, you guys should stop by.
Liam: Thanks for all those greater than three's, guys.
Matt: Less than three's.
Taliesin: Greater than three, too.
Zac: The computer, the story behind that, is during the charity drive, we had a robot read off all the donation messages. And the robot would say, and when they made a heart, it would say, "we less than three."
Matt: So beautiful.
Zac: So we turned that into a thing.
Liam: (robot voice) We less than three you.
Matt: It fucks me up every time you do that.
Zac: Cool. Thanks guys!
Taliesin: Forgot you speak-and-spell.
Zac: Thank you so much.
Marisha: Bye.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone, to the next episode of Critical Role! This week, we have a full party. We'll be continuing just after the climactic battle with the twisted beholder, K'varn. We're going to go ahead and play a couple of videos here while we're waiting for the rest of the party members to settle in, so we'll be back here in just a few minutes. Sit tight and we'll get this party started. We have some fun announcements, some cool gifts that came in we'll be opening towards the end of the session today, but we'll go into those details shortly, so see you in a little bit. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn!
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods; she preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, guys! Welcome back. Thank you for your patience. We have the whole group, finally seem to have defeated the horrible atrocity that is 13th-level Los Angeles traffic. (cheering)
Zac: What's up, internet? I've got a quick announcement.
Matt: Yes.
Zac: Guys, we have a big giveaway today, when we get to 3,300 subscribers. I think we're 50 away or around 48, something like that. When we get to 3,300, we're giving away a dice box, a signed t-shirt, a starter set, and a signed Player's Handbook all in one box for a lucky winner, so if you guys get those subscribers rolling in, that's what helps pay for this show and pay for the entire channel as a whole, so get on that! And we wanted to say thank you to Aaron's Books in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania for sending us this stuff to give away to you guys. (cheering)
Matt: Seriously guys, seriously, that was so cool of you to send that out there, and we want to say, happy sixth graduation, Aaron, congrats to you, well done. (cheering)
Zac: Aaron's a little young to be running a bookstore. That's all I have to say.
Matt: I consider that a very fine entrepreneurial position. You're getting started young, good man.
Zac: So guys, enjoy the game.
Matt: Thank you so much, and thank you again, Aaron and Aaron's books. That's awesome, guys.
Travis: Who was that strange masked man just now?
Matt: I don't know, it's so weird. Okay, so a couple quick things. First off, thank you guys for coming back and watching. Last week we had a few members away, so we had a fun little mini-game with a few folks, some who had played before, some who hadn't, and it turned out very interestingly. I hope my DM's tips were helpful for some folks out there. There's been some great feedback, and hopefully we'll do more things like that in the future for off-days. So, thanks to you. Welcome back, we're getting back into the main story line. Couple other quick things I wanted to mention: first off a big shout-out, birthday shout-out to Kit Buss, our fantastic artist for the show. (cheering)
Travis: Happy Birthday, Kit!
Orion: We love you, Kit.
Ashley: Happy birthday!
Matt: She's awesome, she's amazing, and I've seen a couple little previews of the next piece of art she's been working on and it looks pretty awesome. I think you guys are going to dig it. So she's not done, when she's finished drinking her birthday shots, then I think we'll hopefully see that soon. (laughs) Awesome, thank you so much, Kit!
Marisha: Yes, shots first, then draw.
Matt: Exactly, it's priorities! Also, anyone have any announcements they want to mention before we start the game? Any upcoming stuff?
Travis: The Justice League thing!
Matt: That's true, yeah! DC Kids on Youtube just released their new Super Friends animated series that both me and Travis are in.
Orion: Who are you? Who do you guys play?
Matt: Well, you play Lex Luthor.
Travis: Lex Luthor, and you play Superman.
Orion: Son of a bitch!
Sam: Interesting choice.
Taliesin: You can feel the tension.
Matt: It's a really, really cute show, it's a lot of fun, it's very much a playback to the classic Super Friends cartoon, that kind of comedic atmosphere. You should check it out.
Sam: You're Superman?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: (Clarota voice) Does he talk like this?
Matt: Yeah, it gets a little weird around episode three. I don't think DC's happy with how we treated the license for that one. (laughter)
Travis: That's the best.
Matt: That's every character I do now. Matthew Mercer, reading for Superman: (croaking noise) Also, if anyone else has any other announcements they want to mention?
Marisha: Yeah!
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: You go first.
Orion: Whatchamacallit, a few weeks ago me and Matthew wore these really cool shirts with the vermilion bird from Rubrum, which is in Type-0, the Final Fantasy that we're both in! That shirt was made from Greven, g-r-e-v-e-n, at Redbubble, and we wanted to thank him for those shirts, along with this awesome Final Fantasy shirt, made by August8913, where she did this super cool, it says Nine on the back, his says Trey. Thank you guys, for the really cool shirts.
Travis: Aw, yeah! Jumped on the jam, boogie-woogie jam-slam.
Marisha: I'm going to be at Lock and Load this weekend in Seattle, which is the War Machine Hordes con for Privateer Press.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah! It's awesome, I'm going to be dressed up in my Scar costume. It's going to be awesome, I'm going to be doing a big transformation with Espionage. Yeah, and we're actually going to be pushing the stream; they're going to be streaming it and Geek&Sundry is going to be hosting the Lock and Load stream, so tune in and watch me prance around at Lock and Load in Seattle.
Taliesin: Those are impressive shoes to prance in, by the way.
Marisha: Yeah, some intense stripper heels, yeah.
Orion: Who'd you play?
Matt: Kreoss.
Orion: You were Kreoss, by the way, War Machine Tactics, Matthew Mercer is Kreoss.
Matt: Kreoss, Asphyxius, couple other guys.
Orion: Yeah, yeah, check it out.
Matt: It's fun, it's on Steam.
Liam: Asphyxius?
Matt: Asphysius is the character's name, lich lord Asphyxius, he's bad in town.
Marisha: I'm Haley and Deneghra and Fiora.
Laura: We're going to be at MetroCon next weekend.
Matt: Awesome! MetroCon next weekend.
Travis: (sings) In Tampa.
Laura: (sings) In Tampa, Florida.
Travis: Tampa, Florida.
Matt: Okay. Real fast, before we get to that, I will be, for those who are near--
Marisha: You already did it?
Travis: How many did we have to go?
Zac: 50.
Laura: Ridiculous.
Marisha: 50 subscribers.
Matt: Well, we already hit the mark!
Marisha: Don't we normally hit that in, like, a show?
Matt: That works, you guys are amazing!
Ashley: Yes, that's awesome!
Orion: Thank you, everyone!
Matt: I'll finish my last announcement, then we'll go to that.
Zac: I'm going to go ahead and start the giveaway.
Matt: Go, start the giveaway!
Travis: When is the next giveaway?
Zac: We're going to do-- Those pictures already exist, they shared them with the chatroom. Yeah, so we're going to do this. We're going to do a whole other set of these when we get to the next 50.
Marisha: Oh, a whole other set? There's another one?
Zac: Technically, we have four sets.
Liam: See you in five minutes.
Matt: So we have four sets of those to give away. Every 50 subscribers another set goes out, guys, so that's amazing.
Orion: I could have Sam fart on this for you, if you want.
Sam: Again? Already done, friend, already done.
Matt: Whoa. Okay, there we go. (laughs)
Travis: The world just ended.
Matt: That was close. I just rolled a one on my camera save. Final announcement before we get to the game, for those who are-- (shushing noises)
Orion: Sorry. Okay.
Matt: Can't all talk at once. Also, this weekend I'll be in Sandusky, Ohio, at Colossal Con along with such great folks as Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Blum, other fun greats--
Travis: Is that at the water park?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Son of a bitch.
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, because water parks are totally sanitary. Hot tub's going to be great.
Travis: The dysentery afterwards is--
Zac: Flyingsquid63 is the winner.
All: Flyingsquid63!
Matt: You are the winner of the first set. Congratulations, that's awesome.
Ashley: It's an awesome name.
Marisha: Oh look, and it's green. You're winning green speckled dice, like squid colors.
Matt: There you go, that worked out well, very Cthulhu-ian.
Marisha: I'm justifying. Shut up, Liam! (laughter)
Matt: Well awesome, so we hit our next 50, we'll do another giveaway, we have three more of those packages to give out, guys, so hopefully keep that up. All right, anything else or should we get back into the chaos?
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: I'm scared!
Matt: You should be.
Ashley: I really am.
Sam: We beat the bad guy! It's fine, it's all fine.
Matt: Where we left off.
Orion: I forgot to ask you something before the game, it's fine.
Matt: It's okay. The party, as they ventured deep into the Underdark beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, they sought and discovered Lady Kima of Vord, a folk hero, a paladin of Bahamut who had been captured and tortured by the duergar that lived beneath it. After saving her, they discovered that there was an even deeper, darker, more dangerous evil brewing beneath the surface. There was an illithid, or mind flayer, city of Yug'voril deeper within these cavern structures, and currently the Elder Brain of the colony was under the control of an entity known as K'Varn, they came to find out was a self-mutilated and advanced beholder, who had come into contact with a dark artifact known as the Horn of Orcus that was actually gifted many many, many many, like hundreds of years ago by the god of undeath himself, Orcus, to one of his avatars. Somehow it found its way to this beholder, and gave it enough power to where it gained complete dominion over this colony and these caverns as a whole. The party fought their way through and made a few allies, including the ousted mind flayer, Clarota, seeking to return to his colony, has been fighting alongside them, as well as Lady Kima, the paladin they came to save. Upon finding their way into the final cavern, they used their magic carpet to completely go around the giant city of Yug'Voril, perch on top of the temple in the center of the city, and using a polymorphed fomorian giant (laughs), cascading down hundreds upon hundreds of feet, through the glass structure on top, managed to break their way into the temple, after which a very dangerous battle with K'Varn the beholder took place. A number of very close calls. I posted the stats for them after the fight, if any of you guys got a chance to see it. They made saving throws where it counted, or we'd have a lot more party members that'd be permanently dead. But they managed to take him out; using Tiberius's Telekinesis, they tore the horn from its forehead and the beholder fell to the ground, unmoving and finally killed, as opposed to its undead form, and that's where we begin. As you guys all sit there looking around yourselves, adrenaline still pumping in your ears, the flow of blood.
Orion: Pike--
Ashley: That's me! What do you need?
Orion: Do you have spell of Restoration, the thing that can reverse stone?
Ashley: Yes, I do.
Orion: Clarota, what do you suggest we do? Do we stay, do we leave, or do we-- what do you? There are hundreds upon thousands of illithid rushing at us right now, and they don't like me very much, by the way--
Laura: We should get out of here!
Matt: At which point, Clarota turns to you and says, "You. Bring her." Points to Kima, who is still frozen in stone mid-wielding her maul.
Ashley: To carry her?
Matt: "Stay but a moment; I will talk to them."
Sam: Talk to the hive.
Orion: Very good. Wait, do you want her un-stoned, or still stoned?
Marisha: Well, hang on. Maybe before we unstone Kima, we talk about what we should do with the Horn.
Orion: This is exactly what has to do with the Horn. Is there any way, Pike, could you perhaps half-cast it and hold the spell, don't quite undo her legs from stone, I don't want her to be mobile. I want to ask her--
Ashley: I don't know if I--
Sam: If I may, very quickly, are you with us, Tiberius?
Orion: We will discuss that when we get out of here.
Sam: Because you disappeared for like, the whole fight. Are you with us?
Orion: I am with you.
Sam: Are you going to disappear again?
Orion: To be fair, Scanlan, I never disappeared to begin with!
Sam: Well, you weren't there when we needed you the most. You were out doing God-knows-what.
Orion: Quite the contrary. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be fighting that damn thing.
Sam: What on earth are you talking about?
Orion: Silence. (laughter)
Sam: Dispel Magic. Yes, I did.
Orion: Counterspell.
Sam: Do I have a will save?
Orion: No, you're done, you're quiet.
Matt: That low enough level? No, unfortunately.
Orion: The idea, which I will share-- we don't have time to do that--
Sam: I turn him into a goat.
Orion: He has to say that, it doesn't work.
Matt: I know that. (laughter)
Orion: So the idea is, Pike, if we ask her why she wants the horn, if there is any other reason but to destroy it, we have to--
Sam: Okay, then I'll Banish him.
Laura: (gasps)
Ashley: How about-- well, hold on.
Taliesin: He can't stop it, he can't talk!
Matt: Also requires verbal casting.
Sam: I have to touch him, right?
Matt: You also have to be able to speak.
Sam: Fuck!
Matt: So while you're talking to them, Scanlan is tapping you and mouthing words angrily.
Orion: The idea is, if she doesn't want to destroy it, I say there's something awful, and Keyleth, I believe you want to destroy it, yes?
Marisha: Well, yes, I mean why does she want to take it back up to the surface if it's that terrible?
Orion: I know this is, did you say Orcus, is that his name?
Matt: Orcus, yes.
Orion: This thing is no good at all.
Marisha: Why don't we just throw it in some lava?
Orion: Where is some lava? I would much like to do that.
Marisha: Well, we're around lava, right?
Travis: We were.
Laura: We're not around lava now.
Taliesin: It's a thing of earth. Perhaps taking it to the surface is necessary to destroy it. Why don't we have a conversation with her?
Orion: But she wanted to take it back to Emon. That is not appropriate, we need to destroy this.
Taliesin: Let's get some information first.
Orion: I dispel Silence.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's get some information, let's figure out--
Sam: Oh hi, hi there.
Orion: Sorry, I just wanted to get the point across.
Ashley: I can un-stone her.
Taliesin: We'll un-stone her, it's not like she can take it from us.
Ashley: That's my last 5th-level spell, so we might need to rest.
Taliesin: If something horrible happens, we're going to run anyway at this point.
Matt: I assume you guys have come down in here then.
Orion: I'm staying up, can I not--
Sam: Then how did we have this whole conversation?
Orion: Oh, then I'd be down there.
Laura: I was planning on staying up. I'm not leaving Trinket up there.
Matt: Okay. Good.
Taliesin: Why don't we find out what happens next? And if we have to, you can teleport us out of here, correct?
Orion: Oh, I have a wonderful escape plan.
Marisha: Okay, so Clarota, how much time do we have before something happens next?
Matt: As you say that, Clarota turns, and the two stone doorways on each side of the temple shift open and you notice three mind flayers glide in from the side of the room.
Laura: I notch my arrow.
Orion: No, no! Stop, no don't. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Matt: Two small, bi-pedal, brain-like creatures.
All: No! No.
Matt: At which point, Clarota puts his hands up like this.
Travis: I'm grappled, so.
Matt: Yeah, you're still being held back, but you can try to break from the grapple if you want to roll an athletics check.
Travis: (laughs) I would like to, just because these things ate my fucking mind away. Seven.
Matt: Nope, you're still held against the bars.
Taliesin: You're like an extra in Big Trouble in Little China.
Travis: Oh, it's a 12! I looked at acrobatics.
Matt: Still not enough, unfortunately.
Ashley: Wait, but I cast-- nope, never mind! Keep going!
Matt: Okay. As they begin to move in, and are hovering forward, looking around the room, taking in the scenery, but they're all focused toward the center, they're all just moving towards the Elder Brain. And they make their way up towards it, looking very intent and very frightened at the prospect of what maybe has happened in this room. As they all approach, you can see that low, dull, kind of purplish glow of the Elder Brain is still pumping, but slowly brighter and brighter, almost like it's coming to more life. You can hear the cage rattling of the various entities that are still inside, like the one that's still grappling Grog off to the side. The horn of Orcus, which is still being held aloft by your Telekinesis spell, is just hovering through the air, slowly rotating on its own, little strips of K'Varn's flesh still freshly tumbling from the side.
Orion: And it's at the halfway point between where she is and where I'm standing.
Matt: So right here?
Orion: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Not this big, of course.
Orion: It's really heavy, guys!
Matt: As they all move towards the center, Clarota, with his hands up, turns around, pulls back the hood, and steps towards the other mind flayers, hands stretched out, moving up to the point here.
Ashley: (whispers) Can you instill an inspiration?
Sam: Inspire him? I think he's pretty good on his own.
Orion: "Don't do anything." I'm saying this on the ears.
Matt: The three illithid look over and notice Clarota, and there's a good 20 or 30 seconds of silence as they just look at each other. At which point, Clarota kind of turns around to the rest of the group and looks at them, looks at all of you and lowers his head a little bit as the mind flayers move in towards Clarota, one reaches over and pulls the cap from the back of his head, removes it, at which point Clarota raises up, and if you think you've ever seen an entity with tentacles for a mouth smile, the creases in his awful, rubbery, fleshy face almost give a look of joy, of rediscovered connection, and he looks out to the rest of you and bows a head for a second. I need Grog, Scanlan, Tiberius, Vax, and Pike to all make--
Travis: Tiberius, if he fucks us.
Sam: I think he's about to.
Matt: Intelligence saving throws.
Travis: Oh, I'm grappled! I'm raging, but. Fuck yes! Intelligence saving throws?
Matt: Intelligence saving throws.
Travis: Thank god I rolled high.
Orion: Natural 20.
Travis: (laughs) I get a negative two modifier, that's such bullshit. (laughter)
Matt: Not very wise, there, Grog.
Travis: 17.
Sam: Is this a charm?
Matt: This would be-- no, it would not be.
Marisha: So wait, am I still an elemental? Is that the deal?
Orion: It's 23.
Matt: 23, 20. Scanlan?
Sam: 12.
Matt: 12. Pike?
Laura: She needs better dice.
Ashley: I rolled a six.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Ashley: Six total. (laughs)
Travis: Oh. 17.
Matt: Okay! So. Currently, all the mind flayers at once, including Clarota, angrily lash out with a Mind Blast. You feel your brains all of a sudden fill with searing, horrible pain. Some of you manage to shrug it off, but the rest of you find your bodies locking in place. All right, everyone who failed their save, which would be-- Keyleth, what'd you roll?
Marisha: You didn't have me roll.
Matt: Oh, you need to roll as well, sorry, you're in the blast there. You're still an earth elemental.
Marisha: I thought I was immune to this kind of stuff. (groans) What do I-- not good.
Matt: Not good? All right, that'll be 22 points of psychic damage to Grog, to Pike.
Travis: I passed, right?
Matt: No, you passed this. You're fine.
Laura: Teleport us out of here!
Orion: It doesn't work like that. It's what I was trying to say earlier!
Matt: Scanlan, you are currently stunned, you are actually unable to physically move. Pike, as well. The rest of you manage to resist the Mind Blast, but at this point in time you can now see that this crew, including Clarota, now reconnected with its people, your purpose serving its end, you're about to be swarmed by the rest of the entire city.
Travis: Son of a bitch, taint, fuck!
Matt: Let's roll initiative, guys.
Marisha: We should've gotten out of here!
Travis: I never trusted that Magneto motherfucker! Fuck.
Matt: All right, so. 25 to 20?
Laura: 21.
Marisha: 21, as well.
Matt: Nice. 20 to 15?
Orion: 19.
Taliesin: 17.
Ashley: 16.
Matt: All right, 15 to ten?
Liam: 14.
Sam: 13.
Matt: All right, Grog?
Travis: Eight. Against mind flayers. We're fucking fighting brains and mind flayers again.
Laura: We're all going to die.
Marisha: Okay, wait, you guys run.
Matt: Vex, you're up first.
Marisha: I can start bringing down the palace.
Laura: I'm stuck at the top. Until we can run, we're stuck, because there's only one flying carpet.
Travis: Tiberius has got something for us, right?
Laura: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the Elder Brain and shoot Hail of Thorns into the Elder Brain.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Yes! I like that idea!
Marisha: I'm going to start bringing down the temple! Are we okay with that?
Travis: We're still in it.
Orion: Not while we're still in it.
Marisha: Well, I mean it'll take some time, I'm sure.
Travis: Or it could happen really quick.
Matt: As you guys do notice-- you guys are beginning to see what looks like shadows seemingly coming out from the outside, and you hear what seems to be slight cackling of things sort of in the doorways. So you're shooting Hail of Thorns down into the Elder Brain? Go ahead and roll for the attack.
Laura: 19?
Matt: 19 will hit, yes.
Sam: We're going to be dead in ten minutes.
Matt: What, the teleportation one?
Orion: We'll talk about it later. Plan B, it's ten minutes.
Matt: One minute.
Orion: Sure!
Matt: Pretty sure it's one minute
Marisha: Wait, does this mean you can go and we'll distract?
Orion: No, don't look at it! You said one minute, that's the DM, DM is god.
Laura: Do I roll regular damage, plus the Hail of Thorns?
Matt: I thought it was.
Travis: If someone asks you if you're a god--
All: You say yes.
Travis: You shouldn't look! You shouldn't waste your time.
Matt: Spellcasting time  one minute.
Orion: Oh, yes, I'm so glad I'm wrong.
Laura: 39 on the first hit.
Orion: How many of us are down there?
Ashley: 39?! Yes!
Marisha: All of us except for Laura and Trinket.
Taliesin: And I'm on the carpet, so I can head that direction.
Laura: And then 18 for the second.
Matt: Okay, so you release the first Hail of Thorns. The arrow shatters into a whole--
Laura: And anything within five feet takes damage, as well.
Matt: That'll be all four of them. How much damage do they take?
Laura: They take the same amount unless they make--
Matt: Unless they make a what? Do they have a saving throw against it?
Laura: Oh wait. Yeah. They take half damage on a saving throw.
Matt: Okay. Against what? So two of them make it, two of them don't.
Marisha: Look, look, I do double damage to objects and structures. That's the thing, I'm really good at tearing shit down.
Orion: Now, sometimes fighting isn't the right thing to do!
Marisha: That's why I'm not talking about fighting, I'm talking about collapsing buildings!
Matt: All right, so Clarota and the one nearest to it get behind a pillar for a second and manage to reduce the damage a bit, but the other two are completely pierced all over their bodies where shattered pieces of these kind of jagged thorn arrows exploded all over them and the Elder Brain. The pulsing begins to-- you hear this shrieking in your mind, like the actual presence of the Elder Brain is starting to yell out in pain. You feel it's hardy but hurting. I mean, it's very hefty, it's a large chunk of matter, so god knows how long it would take to take that one down, but it's definitely-- (laughs) it hurt. It's not happy with that. Do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are?
Laura: I want to do my second attack.
Matt: Yeah, that's right!
Laura: Yeah. 15?
Matt: 15 does not hit, unfortunately. You actually fire down and it hits the stonework and the arrow splinters against it. Stay where you are?
Laura: I don't know what else to do. I'm stuck up at the top.
Matt: Jump? What could possibly go wrong! Okay, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Sam: Keyleth!
Marisha: I think my best use-- I agree we need to get out of here, but I'm going to--
Matt: You have shadows moving in from the two open doorways on each side right now.
Marisha: What, so the Elder Brain-- is this a wooden well, or a stone well? What is this?
Matt: Essentially it's a giant stone platform that houses the Elder Brain at the center.
Marisha: Here's what I can do. I can start breaking the well, or I can start blocking entrances. I can start pulling down--
Travis: That one, the second one.
Taliesin: The second one.
Marisha: The second one?
Travis: The second one, close the doorway.
Marisha: All right. Who's coming in from where?
Matt: This is one doorway. That's the other.
Travis: I thought he said it was big.
Marisha: All right, I am going to-- I can make it there, right? That's 35 feet?
Matt: That-- ooh, that's maybe not enough. Yeah no, that's longer than 35 feet.
Laura: Just bull rush and tear down the well.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Fuck it, do what you want to do.
Matt: What do you want to do?
Marisha: All right, all right!
Matt: Just letting you know, just putting this into perspective, here: you're fighting four illithid in the room. You have a city swarming on you right now.
Laura: We need to get out! Or take down the Elder Brain.
Marisha: All right. I am taking down the doors.
Matt: Okay, what are you doing? Are you casting a spell?
Marisha: No, I'm going to start-- can I bull rush, not necessarily right next to the door but like right here, and I'm going to elemental-slam into the wall and siege monster this.
Matt: What's the movement speed of the earth elemental?
Marisha: 35 feet.
Matt: 35 feet? As it's still able to move through stone as well?
Marisha: Yeah! Well, actually, no. When I move through stone I think I can move 60 feet!
Matt: Okay, it is a thick floor. You actually shift into the stonework of the flooring itself and coast through, popping up right out there. That'll get you right at the doorway. You can see there is a slow spiraling incline, like a small-- like an inclined pathway that you can see four illithid making their way up right now, with some large looming stomping sounds coming up behind them.
Marisha: Perfect! So I materialize, using my girth to take up the door, and then I just go (deep voice) boom! And start bringing it down.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make your slam attack or attacks, depending on how many--
Marisha: Slam, I guess.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Get it, Keyleth. (cheering)
Marisha: 26!
Matt: 26, okay go ahead and roll damage on that. Since you are an earth elemental, you do extra siege damage against structures, don't you?
Marisha: Correct. Double damage. So (laughs) okay. So does full damage, plus five, so that's 21-- 42 points of damage.
Ashley: Yes!
Matt: 42 points of damage. So the stone structure, which is pretty rigid and this is an old, old structure; the strange, weird, non-Euclidean design of it has a slight warbling feel to it. You take both of your earth elemental fists and slam them into the side. As you do, the structure gives way and a good 30 feet or so crumbles down around you. You can feel the stones raining onto you. Because of your proximity, you take four points of impact damage.
Marisha: I like it! It feels good! This is what I bathe in!
Matt: This entire doorway is ruined, and there's a good 15-foot pile of stonework now blocking that entranceway.
Marisha: 15-foot pile?
Matt: Yeah. But there's a hole above it, where the stone fell through. So there is about 50 feet up a section of the wall that is collapsed down.
Marisha: Whatever, it'll make it harder. Right, that's my turn.
Matt: Okay, do recall that mind flayers do levitate.
Travis: Aw. (groans) God! Maybe not now, they don't?
Matt: All right, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Yeah, okay--
Matt: You can also see forms swarming through the other doorway over there.
Laura: Teleport us!
Orion: This isn't good.
Laura: Fly us! Get us out.
Orion: How far? Scanlan's only like a foot away from me, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: I'm right next to him!
Matt: Yep.
Orion: Oh!
Travis: Beam us out, Scotty.
Orion: Shit. Okay. I cast Fly on myself.
Sam: (laughs) Bye, Tiberius! (laughter)
Orion: I redact that, actually. Is it possible-- I'm at least standing next to him, right?
Matt: You are.
Orion: I don't have to use a move action right now. I can, like, look at him.
Sam: I leap!
Orion: Okay, can I give him-- can I take off my Ioun Stone as an action, and swap his crown?
Matt: No, I'm pretty sure-- if the item says "attunement" on it, you have to spend a short rest attuning yourself with the weapon. If either of them does.
Orion: But he didn't. He hasn't attuned himself to the thing yet.
Sam: To what?
Matt: Right, but your Ioun stone-- you mean take it from him?
Orion: Yeah!
Matt: You would have to attune it to yourself in order to use it.
Orion: How long does it take?
Matt: It takes a short rest.
Orion: Shit! Okay, that changes everything in a very bad way.
Matt: What are you doing? The other doorway isn't blocked, you have mind flayers running in, you have probably more and more swarming from underneath the temple, probably over at some point, from what you've seen of the temple structure.
Orion: Okay, so I'm going to attempt to crush the Horn. With a thousand pounds of pressure.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Because my Telekinesis is still going.
Matt: That's true.
Orion: I can't do anything else without dropping this thing because as soon as I do anything else, I drop the horn. So I have to do that first.
Matt: Okay, so you use your action, go ahead and roll for that, for the crushing of Telekinesis.
Travis: Oh god.
Orion: What am I adding?
Matt: You're adding your modifier, which I think is five.
Orion: Oh, 23.
Matt: As you focus intensely, you feel that the Horn itself-- the sheer force of the artifact is far too powerful for your meager magic to have any sort of effect on its physical structure.
Orion: I thought so.
Matt: As you focus your arcane intent on crushing it, you feel almost like the back of your brain begins to crawl with cold energy, and if you could hear-- if you could hear laughter come from something that is inanimate, you're hearing it coming from the Horn right now.
Travis: Fuck that horn.
Matt: That's your action.
Orion: I'm going to--
Laura: Float it into the Bag of Holding!
Orion: I'm going to maneuver around the chaos because I'm not within range of anybody to hurt me, right?
Matt: Not currently, no.
Orion: So I'm going to hop on the carpet.
Liam: This is all taking six seconds, by the way.
Matt: 30, that's as far as you can get.
Orion: Well, I can run.
Matt: You already used your action to Telekinesis.
Orion: Oh. That's stupid.
Matt: That's how it works.
Orion: "Hey, Percy!" (laughs) That's my turn, that's all I can do. And I still maintain the thing.
Matt: Okay. That brings us-- end of Tiberius's turn, to Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to start flying straight up, and while I'm flying straight up, I'm going to take... two shots with the Pepperbox at the big brain.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll twice.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Sharpshooter. That's a 21? That's 21.
Matt: 21 does hit.
Taliesin: And should I do both hits?
Matt: Yeah, roll both.
Taliesin: Oh, and-- no, that's right, I don't critical at 19?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: No, I need a specialty. Damn it! And that hits, so both hit, and they're both with Sharpshooter, so that's nice. (sings) I haven't pulled my dice out yet. There we go.
Liam: Come on, gunslinger!
Taliesin: Oh, that's nice! 25 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And 17 points of damage.
Matt: All right, gotcha.
Taliesin: Oh, sorry. I forgot, sorry, four points of fire damage.
Matt: Okay, good. All right, so as you (gunshot) turn over the barrel of your weapon, fire again, the second one bursting into flame as it hits the top of the Elder Brain, you can see both bullets sink into the flesh. There's no impact; they just seem to be absorbed in by it. The flame one, you see a jet of flame go from the inside and the flesh of the actual large Elder Brain quivers for a moment. You hear another shrieking, angry pain growl in your minds just by the proximity of this entity. You don't see it doing too much to it, but it's definitely hurting it. That ends your turn?
Marisha: Things can hurt really bad and not do that much damage.
Matt: Clarota spins and comes up behind you--
Laura: Don't be a dick.
Travis: Remember our days watching Saved by the Bell together?
Matt: You are stunned currently, so it gets advantage on that. So that's 24. All right, so Clarota's tentacles wrap around your head-- (gasping)
Travis: Whose?
Matt: You immediately take 15 points of psychic damage and you are currently grappled.
Sam: And stunned.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: (sings) Grappled and stunned, so grappled and stunned!
Matt: All right, that comes to Pike! Pike, you're stunned currently, mind still reeling from the pain; go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Ashley: Ugh, okay.
Travis: We're just trying to stay alive.
Ashley: I just rolled a one.
Matt: Your physical form is still unable to pull yourself out of that continuous psychic pain, you're like (groans) trying to just tear your mind out of it, unable to do so. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I click my Boots of Haste and I'm going to-- where's the thingie, do we have a thingie here?
Ashley: What do you need?
Liam: The light.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: All right, great. How's this work? Like that. If I can run right between Pike and this little brain jerk right here, does that get me within five feet of Elder Brain if I'm there? I can't tell from the structure.
Matt: You can rush there, you would have to get up onto here.
Liam: Yeah, that's what I want to do, and then, I don't know. That's not my full double-movement, I don't know how that affects the number of attacks I have Hasted, but I just want to stab it as many times as I can, standing on top of this thing.
Matt: All right, got it.
Liam: Where's the meteorite die?
Orion: Fuck you, couch!
Liam: Using my poison dagger.
Travis: Prison shank that thing.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to shiv him in his shank or shank him in his shiv, whichever is the more accurate phrase.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for attack twice.
Travis: Can you scream out "lobotomy" while you do it?
Matt: As a note, as you rush by, for an attack of opportunity, the intellect devourer does reach out and strike at you with its claws.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Rolls a one. You just kick it off to the side, it rolls on its side, its brain matter (clunks) on the ground.
Liam: Do I get two or three attacks?
Matt: You get three if you use your bonus to attack.
Liam: First one misses. Second one is-- oh wait, the first was a 17, is that--
Laura: That doesn't miss.
Liam: Hit or miss, it's a brain, right, I'm standing--
Matt: Total 17? That would still-- it doesn't miss, but as you strike down for it, there's a psychic field that's defending it, and your blade is held at bay by the protective sphere.
Liam: Okay, then I'm using now dagger of venom is 26.
Matt: Okay, that does hit.
Liam: Okay, so that's four plus six is ten, because this isn't Sneak Attack or anything.
Matt: No.
Liam: That's ten plus a poison for a DC of 15?
Matt: Okay. It makes its saving throw. Rolled a 17.
Liam: So that was that, and then the third attack I'll go back to the keen dagger. 14.
Matt: 14. The second one strikes through, the poison tries to pulse through but once again it resists the impact; the third dagger comes down and before it even gets halfway towards, there's a blast of psychic energy from the inside of the containment unit that holds the Elder Brain that (boof) forces your hand back, the attack deflected entirely. That ends your turn. The other three illithids now go.
Ashley: I wish we had inspiration.
Orion: Isn't there a rope still hanging from there? Throw the damn rope!
Laura: You can climb it.
Liam: Yeah, I can probably get up 15 feet and hang there.
Travis: Yeah, I'm getting a massage right now.
Matt: This one's also going to turn around, reach forward, and its tentacles are going to attempt to wrap around Pike's head--
Travis: Don't you touch my friend.
Matt: That's going to be a 20?
Travis: A natural 20?
Matt: No, it's just 20. So Pike, you go ahead and take-- this'll be 15 points of psychic damage.
Liam: It was a good run, folks.
Marisha: What happened?
Laura: He rolled a 20.
Ashley: So he rolled a 20.
Matt: I rolled a total of 20. And you're stunned currently, so you take 15 points of psychic damage as you feel-- as you're trying to resist yourself, these cold tentacles wrap across the front of your field of vision, and you can feel this weird, toothy, pointy, biting sensation beginning to push towards the back of your skull. This one--
Ashley: That's it, that's all she wrote.
Matt: This one here is going to--
Laura: He's going to try to eat her brain!
Matt: Tiberius, that is a 15 versus AC.
Orion: Nope!
Matt: What's your AC?
Orion: 17, man!
Matt: 17, as you're rushing toward the magic carpet that just took off, yeah, you look over and the tentacles swing toward you, you duck just underneath and manage to avoid the attack. Now the two intellect devourers. One's going to go ahead and look up towards the magic carpet that's taking off and-- here we go. Oh, within ten feet? No, you're too far away. So instead it's going to go for you on top of the Elder Brain. I want you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw, Vax.
Liam: 20, natural 20.
Matt: Natural 20!
Sam: Needed that.
Laura: That's not to Matt, that's to the little brains.
Liam: The brains, the brains.
Marisha: Fuck you, little brains.
Matt: So you feel a similar blast of screaming energy, like you feel from the illithids, but it's more primal and more guttural. You manage to shrug it off in your mind and angrily look down at this weird, fleshy creature. The other one moves up and attempts to blast you again from the opposite side. Make another intelligence saving throw.
Liam: 19.
Matt: 19! Once again you feel from the back of your brain this like stunning impact and you shrug it off looking over this way.
Liam: (jeering) I'm smart! (laughter)
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: I'm grappled and stunned.
Matt: Yeah, so go ahead and make your saving throw.
Travis: Come on, buddy. (cheering)
Orion: Boom!
Matt: You shrug off the stunned effect, you're currently grappled by the entity.
Laura: You're so smart!
Ashley: You're so smart!
Marisha: You're so smart!
Travis: Cardiac kid, come on now, here we go. Table's getting hot.
Liam: Aren't you inspired?
Matt: And then also make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: Oh, Jesus. Because he's also got the things on me.
Liam: Just say 20.
Sam: Seven. (laughs) Plus two.
Liam: Big nine.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I said big nine.
Ashley: He rolled a 20, so that's gotta mean something.
Taliesin: I think a nine is a big six.
Marisha: The 20 carries over one, right? (laughter)
Travis: Residual?
Marisha: You take the one and you carry it over.
Travis: Natural 20 residual.
Liam: I personally can't wait until we roll new characters next show.
Laura: No.
Marisha: Shut up!
Matt: Unfortunately, you're still stunned.
Sam: Still stunned? Oh, so I got off--
Matt: You resisted the mind effect, but the tentacles on your head are now locking your brain in place, and your eyes are kind of rolling back in your head as you feel the illithid's mouth begin to push against the outside of your head. Grog?
Travis: I've got to break my grapple, right?
Matt: Yeah. Just go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Travis: One.
Matt: A natural one?
Sam: This guy.
Matt: A natural one; it rolled a four!
Orion: Plus your strength! Oh, it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: It doesn't matter.
Matt: Okay. So it's still holding you in place; you have your axe you picked up off the ground with your chain of returning; you can't physically move from your position as it's holding you there.
Travis: The axe is across the room, remember?
Matt: Well, no, you threw it over here and retrieved it at the end of the battle.
Travis: Well that's a good, that's a good plus.
Ashley: (frustrated noise)
Marisha: The fuck!
Matt: So what do you want to do?
Laura: You could attack with your chain.
Travis: I can attack with the chain?
Matt: You have your axe with your chain of returning, you just can't move, but you can still throw if you want to.
Orion: Oh, awesome.
Marisha: Can you chop the dude's arms off?
Travis: I have no-- it's holding me, I don't think I can be like--
Ashley: Maybe the guy that has him, his tentacles or whatever?
Travis: I was going to try and save you.
Ashley: Well. That's far.
Travis: Can I reach the illithid-- it's far?
Matt: Well, you can throw to either of them right now. They're both bent over gnome heads, they're bigger--
Travis: Where's Scanlan?
Ashley: Why the gnomes?
Matt: He's here, and that's Pike.
Ashley: Why the gnome hate?
Marisha: It's rare. It's a rare delicacy.
Matt: You guys were right there.
Travis: All right, I can't-- I'm going to try and throw it at the illithid that's on Scanlan.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Ashley: Tasty gnome.
Liam: All the fans who implied that Matt went light on us the last game--
Travis: 22?
Matt: 22, definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Okay, it's just one, two, three. Shit balls. 14.
Matt: 14 points of damage, all right. That one, you throw the axe, it slams into the shoulder of the illithid that's grabbing on to him. You see it look up at you angrily and a large portion of its chest is now gashed open and blood is pouring from the wound, but it's still holding tight right now. I think that's going to end your turn.
Travis: No, I'm done.
Matt: Do you want to pull your axe back?
Travis: Yes, I would like to.
Matt: Go ahead and you (grunts). Go ahead and make your check.
Travis: What do I, what the fuck do I roll, to the thing. What do I roll? A 12?
Matt: Yeah. A 20, you have to roll a d20, that was a d12.
Travis: Okay, good. (laughter)
Travis: 18.
Matt: So you pull on the chain of returning and it yanks the axes out of the wound and you catch it in midair, preparing for the next round.
Travis: (laughs) The 12 was a one. (laughter)
Matt: All right, first round of combat over. Let's roll better, guys. This is looking really dire. Vex, you're up.
Ashley: Get it.
Sam: Save everyone.
Matt: You're up at the top, you have a clear view of everyone.
Marisha: That's true, you're the only one with a bird's-eye view.
Sam: Just run. Save yourself.
Matt: As it is, these two illithids look kind of hurt, these two look really rough, this one looks really rough, both of these guys haven't been damaged yet but they have low hit points.
Sam: Save yourself, start a new race of people.
Laura: I am going to attack--
Sam: Hunter's Mark!
Laura: I'm going to put Hunter's Mark on-- oh, my brother just died.
Liam: I fainted.
Laura: On the one attacking Scanlan.
Taliesin: Not on Scanlan, on the one attacking Scanlan.
Matt: Oh right, sorry. (laughter)
Travis: What did he do?
Matt: In the confusion--
Sam: (shrieking) Help!
Orion: Friendly fire!
Ashley: That was amazing.
Laura: 14?
Matt: 14 unfortunately does--
Ashley: Plus! Plus War God's Blessing?
Matt: You're stunned.
Ashley: But can't I just do it just because?
Matt: No, unfortunately.
Marisha: Once, just this once, please?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Laura: But he's bent over and I've got a bird's-eye view of him.
Matt: You know what? He is grappling and he is right in the way, I'll go ahead and give you advantage on that attack. Roll again.
Laura: Yes! So I just roll again?
Matt: Roll again. Take whatever it is.
Laura: 22!
Matt: 22 will hit, okay. Because it is a stationary position, completely engulfing, and you have such a great view from above.
Laura: Right? 11 points of damage?
Matt: Okay. Did you roll your Hunter's Mark damage?
Laura: No, I did not.
Matt: Don't forget Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I won't, though. Three extra. That's for Hunter's Mark.
Ashley: 14 total?
Matt: Okay, gotcha. That's your first strike.
Laura: Okay. On my second one, should I just try to attack him again, kill him? All right, I'm going to kill him, try to hit him again. 18?
Matt: 18. Okay! So both strikes (whoosh). Go ahead and roll for damage.
Laura: 16 plus-- 19.
Matt: 19, okay. Both arrows (zoomf, zoomf), one embeds itself in the wound that Grog had left with the axe and you see the body tenses. Clarota stares up at you with this beaming angry look on his face; you realize, oh shit, Clarota's the one that's going after Scanlan. Your second arrow you bring down and release and it pierces the side of its face, gashing through and embedding itself in the chest. You can see now Clarota's looking really rough, but he's still holding taut. This horrible thought goes into your mind suddenly, a familiar voice saying, "You've all done your work. Now it's time to feast!"
Sam: (gasps) He turned on us!
Laura: I knew he was going to do that!
Sam: What? None of us knew that!
Laura: I totally knew he was going to do that.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn; Keyleth, you're up.
Travis: I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. (laughter)
Ashley: Every week.
Travis: Every week!
Sam: You know who would help us right now?
Laura: Kima would help us, but she's stone.
Sam: Can we make her not stone?
Ashley: We can make her not stone, except we didn't get a chance to.
Liam: If we live, we're in store for so much I-told-you-so. (laughter)
Liam: It's a big if.
Sam: Maybe we should leave her. I don't want to deal with that.
Travis: Who's up?
Marisha: I can make, I'm going to-- aw, crap. I'm going to phase down, and I'm going to pop up, and I'm going to break the well that's holding the Elder Brain.
Ashley: Get it!
Matt: Okay, so you're going to pop up here? Over here?
Liam: No, not there!
Matt: Right there?
Marisha: Not where I might hurt Vax.
Sam: Well, that's anywhere.
Laura: Just do the other side!
Marisha: You might have to do, like, a flippy-poo off it.
Matt: So what are you doing on the well, you're just grabbing it?
Marisha: Can I? Can I flip?
Matt: No, it's embedded in the ground. What are you doing?
Marisha: Oh, okay, so I want to take and I want to just punch to crack a big side of it to help spill out the brains.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a slam attack on the side
Marisha: Bust the side of it open.
Ashley: And then we'll stomp on him and make brain juice.
Marisha: I mean, it's an item, it's a stationary rock, so what do I add? Oh wait, I add-- so plus-- sorry, I'm not used to this. Plus eight, 16?
Matt: 16? You slam into the side of this; you're not attacking the brain, you're attacking the stonework. You can feel there is some psychic resistance, but because you're not attacking the brain directly, your fist slams into it, making purchase in the stone. Go ahead and roll damage against the stone.
Travis: Come on!
Matt: Double damage on this.
Ashley: Big damage!
Marisha: 20 damage.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: 20 damage. The side of the stonework crumples inward. Pieces of the stonework itself seem to be jutting in toward the Elder Brain, but it's stopped by some sort of psychic resistance, but the whole side here to here is now just open entirely, and you can see now the hole, the mass of-- there's probably hundreds of various illithid brains that have slowly congealed into one large brain structure as now you can see the underneath area. The liquid it kind of sits in is now pouring out, down the side of the structure.
Marisha: Hope they have flood insurance. (groans and laughter)
Travis: That was the worst Schwarzenegger action line ever. (Terminator voice) Hope they have flood insurance, ja.
Marisha: The Geico slayer!
Travis: Holy shit. That was amazing.
Marisha: Flo just got real, all right? Flo just got real.
Taliesin: That's no better, actually.
Marisha: From Progressive Flo? All the flow of the-- you know what, never mind.
Matt: So you only have the one slam attack? Earth elemental doesn't multi-attack?
Marisha: Yes, just the one. My slam attack is--
Matt: Right. Cool.
Marisha: Oh no, wait! I have multi-- earth elemental makes two slam attacks!
Matt: That's good to know. Go ahead and make another one.
Marisha: I could have done that last time?
Matt: Are you attacking the stonework still?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm just going to take the other chunk and punch it.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say you used some of your movement to move this way. By the way, guys, you can break up your movement. You can move, attack, then move if you want to.
Marisha: You can?
Matt: Yeah!
Travis: Unless Tickle-me-Elmo is holding you by the cage.
Marisha: It's cocked. 16 plus eight, so 22.
Matt: That'll definitely do it; go ahead. Is that total damage? Oh, that's the attack. Okay, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Ugh, four plus-- 18 damage.
Matt: 18's fine. So you break out the second half and now the entire side of it is open. All the fluid just spilled out the side and you get the sensation this is very frowned upon. (laughter)
Matt: That ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up!
Travis: A tentacle frown.
Orion: So I rush up, and Percy takes off?
Matt: As a note too, just so you guys are aware--
Taliesin: I didn't know you were coming to the carpet, sorry.
Laura: Oh no, we never closed the other door!
Matt: You start seeing a series of other entities slowly making their way up from the downstairs tunnel area.
Sam: I think we can beat them all.
Orion: Seeing what's going on-- there's an illithid right behind me, right?
Matt: There is. Right behind you, yeah.
Travis: I thought she closed the door.
Laura: No, we didn't.
Matt: Yeah, the other door is open.
Marisha: I closed the one, but then he said that they could levitate so I decided it wasn't worth it.
Sam: Hey, man. Grog's being held prisoner by an 80-pound dude.
Orion: So I'm running off and then Percy takes off? So I can't get to him?
Matt: Yeah, he's (whoosh), you can't get to him.
Orion: Awesome.
Travis: I'm so ashamed right now.
Orion: I need a technical question. Can I move the Horn and let go of the spell so I can then do my turn? Or does that take a thing to do that? Like, I want to let it go--
Matt: No.
Orion: Good. So as I'm running up to the carpet, I see Percy go and I'm like, "(growls) Damn Tiamat-lover!" So I bring over the Horn and right at the tip, on the carpet, I let it go. "You deal with it then!"
Matt: Percy? (loud clatter)
Laura: Oh no, K'Varn!
Matt: That's what you get!
Orion: I don't give it to Percy, I let it land on the carpet.
Matt: I know. I'm saying it's on his carpet right now, staring at him from the side.
Ashley: Put it on, Percy!
Orion: I see the-- oh god. Okay, I can only do this once. I see the-- they're not inside yet, right?
Matt: No. They're just starting to get to the doorway. You can see them right there.
Orion: Awesome. Okay, that is a-- and this is a-- Okay.
Matt: What you got, Tiberius? (laughter)
Travis: (Tiberius voice) Poppycock, poppycock.
Orion: Right. I have-- I blow everything. I'm going to blow everything.
Travis: Yes! Blow everybody. (laughter)
Matt: How diplomatic of you!
Sam: I'm stunned!
Orion: You cannot resist!
Matt: So, Tiberius.
Orion: As I leave the Horn there, I turn to where the door is. Obelisk of Stone. I seal up the entryway.
Matt: How many with that, what level are you using it?
Orion: Well, how wide is it? Like 15 feet?
Matt: It's a little over five feet wide.
Orion: Great. I only need one, right?
Matt: Technically, yeah.
Orion: Okay. So I seal that one-- I'm going to use all three right now.
Marisha: Seal the other one, too. I only partially sealed it.
Orion: I'll seal the other one.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: And I'll use the other one on myself.
Matt: Okay!
Orion: And I'm going to use-- I only have three left. Yeah, okay. And I'm going to use my last three sorcerer points that I have, and I have zero points after this, and I'm going to cast Blur on myself. And that's my turn.
Matt: All righty. You now start hearing (boof, boof) slamming sounds from the other side of the stone walls. Both sides of the walls are now sealed off with pillars, and a large pile of rubble on that side. All right, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, before I go anywhere, I'm taking a shot at Clarota.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Betraying bastard.
Taliesin: With Sharpshooter, that's 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 19 points?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That hits, and let's do my damage. That's 22 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. So, Scanlan, as you're stunned, you feel the tentacles swirling around the back of your head. Teeth are grinding into the back of your skull, and you feel this horrible pain as all of a sudden, Clarota's mouth is beginning to find a way towards your skull. (laughter)
Matt: And then the tentacles suddenly go limp as the back of Clarota's head (gunshot) becomes a mess.
Taliesin: Traitor!
Marisha: Traitor!
Laura: I can't believe we killed Clarota!
Taliesin: Some people have no sense of fucking honor! (laughter)
Marisha: Traitor!
Travis: Oh, Percy!
Matt: In a split second, your longtime ally, now turncoat, is scattered across the stone floor. You're released, you're no longer stunned.
Sam: (gasps) Hi, guys!
Taliesin: I still have another shot.
Matt: You do.
Marisha: There's someone on Pike, right?
Matt: There's still one on Pike right now, yeah, right here.
Taliesin: I'm taking a shot there.
Travis: Come on, Perce!
Ashley: Perce!
Marisha: Pew pew!
Taliesin: Oh yeah! So that's 17-- 17, 18, 19--
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Okay, that just hits, all right. I'm trying to use Sharpshooter, so it changes everything. And that's 18 points of damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And did we get a short rest before this fight happened?
Sam: No.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Fuck, never mind.
Matt: No you did not.
Marisha: That's why we're all burnt out on spells.
Taliesin: That's why we're all burnt out on shit, okay.
Orion: Except me.
Matt: Yeah, the other one--
Taliesin: I'm going to go up further.
Matt: Even further? Okay.
Laura: "Because I didn't help you guys!" Thanks, Tiberius!
Ashley: "I abandoned my troop!"
Orion: It's going to come in handy now!
Taliesin: Am I high enough yet for her to jump down onto the--
Matt: Yeah, you could probably pull it off.
Taliesin: So, if you and your bear want to jump on?
Matt: It'd be an acrobatics roll, but yeah.
Sam: Wait, why would you-- you've got to come save us!
Laura: Yeah, no, go down and save them, honestly, because I'm staying up top for right now, unless we can teleport out.
Taliesin: Oh, in that case, instead of going up I'm going to go fly to the right, then.
Orion: Pick up Vax!
Laura: Why?
Orion: I said Vax.
Laura: Vax?
Marisha: Vax? Pick up Vax?
Orion: Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah, so I'm going to fly down towards Vax, as well.
Matt: Okay. So you're going down to here instead?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you can get about-- we'll say, if you're just going--
Taliesin: Yeah, go there.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Hi.
Ashley: Hey you guys!
Taliesin: Hey you guys!
Marisha: Hey you guys!
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn. That brings it--
Ashley: Did anything happen to the guy that had me--
Matt: He just took damage, but he's not done yet.
Ashley: He just took damage, he's still (slurps).
Matt: So, Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: It's my turn.
Matt: Go ahead and roll to get rid of the Mind Blast stun.
Ashley: Come on.
Sam: Come on, Pikey.
Ashley: Fuck. It's seven.
Matt: Seven? Nope. You're still locked in place.
Taliesin: Can you heal yourself?
Matt: She cannot move. Her entire brain is locked in with a searing clenching pain, psychic energy is just clutching her brain and holding it hostage.
Sam: Still beautiful, though. (laughter)
Matt: You feel, once again, the teeth beginning to pierce the back of the flesh. You feel the teeth of the mind flayer beginning to scrape against the skull, the actual bone it's found in the back. Vax, you're up.
Liam: What did Clarota do with his hat?
Matt: Oh, it's somewhere on the ground over here.
Liam: Over behind--
Matt: Over behind this.
Liam: Okay, I'm still Hasted, I'm going to run down the center over Clar-- I'm going to step on Clarota's-- I don't know if he has nuts, but whatever's there, I'm going to step there, run around Scanlan, and place his fucking hat on my head.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And then run up behind that third mind flayer, who I don't think has taken a hit yet, and just start stabbing him in the back.
Matt: Right here?
Laura: No, on Pike!
Liam: I can't get back there.
Laura: You can't?
Liam: I don't think so.
Laura: Would he be able to make it?
Liam: Well it's up to-- oh dear.
Matt: You can't, with the speed you're running there, because your Hasted speed is doubled, so it's 60 feet.
Liam: I'm Hasted, I can run 12 spaces, so if you think that I could have run around the mind flayer, put on the party hat--
Matt: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. You can move right there.
Liam: Okay, great. So I'm going to start stabbing him in the back, angrily.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Okay, yeah, so, first one is a 15?
Matt: Unfortunately-- no, that does just hit.
Liam: That's a Sneak Attack, because she's next to him. There's nothing in the rule book about stunned, or unconscious, or anything.
Matt: How Sneak Attack works is if they're next to someone that's aggressive toward them; they feel like they have people on two fronts, which is why you get the benefit.
Taliesin: He is, to be fair, very occupied.
Matt: I will say, circumstantially though, because he is currently grappled on to Pike, and is in the process of trying to grind into her brain with his mouth, he is a little preoccupied at the moment.
Travis: He's sucking head.
Matt: So I'm going to go ahead and make a perception roll versus your fast movement. Go ahead and make a stealth-- roll stealth to see whether or not he takes notice and changes his position in defense.
Liam: I rolled a 24.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead. The first attack you rolled was a 15, that hits!
Liam: Okay, thank you.
Matt: And that is a Sneak Attack, he did not see you coming that quickly.
Liam: All right, so that is four, plus seven is 11, plus-- okay, that's 17, 21, thank you. 26, 30, 33. 33 with keen dagger.
Matt: 33 with the keen dagger?
Liam: And I'm sticking that in the back of his neck.
Matt: Okay. That was your first attack?
Liam: That's the first attack.
Matt: Okay, so the first dagger (shnk) sinks into the back of the neck. You just manage to miss all the seriously vital stuff, but you carve a giant section out of the side of its head. The rest of its leathery black outfit's now slick with its own blood. You see it angrily growls, almost this weird guttural, this (gurgling growl) sound as it still remains taut and clenched on Pike, its eyes glaring at you, basically telling you, "Look what I'm about to do to your friend."
Liam: Okay, so good thing I have more knives. So I take the other one, flip it in my hand and then stick it into the neck afterwards. That's a 24.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Yeah, it does. That's eight. Fire damage, I don't know if he takes any fire damage, and I'm going to then stick him with my poison dagger, which isn't going to poison him. But that is a 26 which hits as well.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: And that is eight.
Matt: Eight points of damage. So the first one you stab in the side of the head, you pull back and toss it in the air, catch the second one. As it bursts into flames you place the searing dagger down into the center of its back between its shoulder blades. Its back tenses, and as it does it reaches back and tries to grab for the dagger as you pull back the third one. As it looks back at you it brings up one arm to stop you as it goes in to directly go after Pike's head. The third dagger you then stab it right in the front of the skull. Its eyes roll back in its head and its tentacles limply drag off. (cheering)
Liam: As a bonus action, I would like to Goodfellas-kick him about eight times in the ribs. (laughter)
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: I'll allow it. Oh my god. Because that guy was next! If we didn't kill him this turn, she would've taken 55 points of damage.
Travis: 50-- Let's not even say the number.
Ashley: You saved my life.
Matt: Yeah. And if it takes you to zero hit points, they extract the brain and eat it.
Laura: Now we've got to squish those little brains.
Liam: There's still a mind flayer.
Travis: We're coming real close.
Matt: Let's see if they get their Mind Blast back. Nope. Nope.
Liam: This show is not good for my blood pressure.
Marisha: I know! It's like constant fight or flight.
Travis: I think I'm going blind in my left eye.
Marisha: This should fix your sleep schedule though, right?
Travis: Yeah, totally.
Matt: Seeing both of them get immediately slaughtered, both of these illithids just Plane Shift. A defensive standpoint, self-preservation is kicking in. However, intellect devourers do not have self-preservation. They're there for a specific reason. So this one here is going to move over to this side and is going to attempt to make a Devour Intellect attack against Keyleth. Keyleth, go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Marisha: I'm an elemental, so.
Matt: You keep your intelligence score as you.
Marisha: Oh, I do?
Matt: The physical attributes you get from the elemental form. You keep your intellect, wisdom, and charisma.
Marisha: Okay, then 18.
Matt: 18, Okay. You resist the blast of mental impact from the intellect devourer, now on the ground with its four feral legs, its brain form rippling. The second one is going to turn over here and saw the two shots, the one that took out Clarota. It turns up towards Percy, as you've lowered on the magic carpet, Percy. Go ahead and make an intellect saving throw.
Taliesin: Eight.
Matt: Eight? All righty.
Sam: Oh boy. That ain't no good.
Matt: You take 11 points of psychic damage.
Taliesin: There's an "and" there, isn't there?
Sam: And it's undone immediately. (laughter)
Matt: And you take eight points of intellect damage.
Laura: Oh, this is what happened to Grog!
Travis: You're better off than six, right?
Taliesin: Eight points of intellect damage. What does that mean, precisely?
Liam: Minus from your intelligence.
Sam: You would know if you had more intellect.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: No, no, no, no. For this, it basically-- what's your intelligence?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16? Yeah, the blast hits you and you just shrug off the impact. It has to exceed your intelligence.
Taliesin: So do I still take eight more points of damage, though?
Matt: No, no no. You just the additional--
Taliesin: I just, I'm just going to go duh-duh. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, the intellect damage is not permanent.
Taliesin: I like purple.
Matt: Not quite that bad.
Travis: I can't not do it.
Matt: All right. That ends their turn. That brings us to Scanlan. You're no longer stunned. You now have full capacity of yourself and you're looking around, oh shit.
Sam: Do we get out of here or do we try to kill these things?
Travis: Can you get us out of here?
Sam: I can get some of us out of here.
Marisha: Start getting us out.
Sam: Are we getting out or are we fighting?
Travis: Getting us out.
Marisha: Because we still have these fuckers we have to--
Ashley: Because Tiberius can get some of us out, right?
Liam: It's just the brains. Just the little brains.
Sam: It's just the little brains. For now.
Matt: Make a perception check, by the way.
Marisha: For now, but people can beat through those doors. That's not a permanent thing.
Taliesin: We need 60 seconds to get out of here is what we need. We need 60 uninterrupted seconds.
Marisha: Well, we can start gathering our shit and packing up.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Marisha: We can start packing up.
Sam: Am I leaving or am I staying?
Travis: You do what you want.
Liam: Do what you want. It's chaos.
Sam: (sighs) All right. Then I'll attack.
Matt: Swarming thing that drift up the sides of the temple from the floor. Coming from inside the temple and out toward the top.
Laura: We should probably get out of here! They're coming up the sides!
Ashley: We can't get you out of here if you don't come--
Sam: I run up to Pike. I grab her hand. I say, "I want to have babies with you." (laughter)
Sam: Let's get out of here. (sings) So now I come to you with Dimension Door.
Ashley: Wait! Can I do a Mass Cure Wounds before we leave? (laughter)
Sam: And we get out.
Matt: You're still stunned from the Mind Blast. You haven't made your save.
Sam: We're going up to the top of the-- to the thing. Just to the roof there.
Laura: They're coming up the sides!
Ashley: We've got to go somewhere else.
Sam: Well, I didn't know that. (laughs) It's done.
Orion: It's fine. It's good that they're up there.
Sam: And, as a bonus, I'm going to send some inspiration to Grog.
Matt: Okay, as you Dimension Door you just go ahead and look back. Using the song of love you gave to Pike, you give back, give a wink to Grog. Grog, you take a 1d10 inspiration. 1d10 inspiration dice to you.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Grog, we would like you to rage.
Travis: I'm already there. I'm just being fucking grappled. Is it my turn?
Matt: It is now.
Travis: Oh, can I try it for the third time to break free?
Matt: You can. Go ahead and go ahead and make your athletics.
Liam: Use that inspiration die, man.
Travis: I'll use the inspiration die just in case I rolled balls again.
Matt: Well, you can use it after you do it. See what you roll and then add it.
Travis: It's athletics, right?
Matt: Athletics, yeah.
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18?
Liam: Come on.
Matt: Yeah, you (boosh) break out of the creature's grasp. Suddenly it's reaching at you from behind the bars. You can see there's this slick, brackish oil on your body from where it was holding you. Fleshless arms clutching you to the bars.
Travis: So is everybody leaving? Should I climb up the rope?
Matt: There is Lady Kima who is turned to stone.
Marisha: We've got to get Kima out.
Travis: Fuck Lady Kima!
Orion: Pick her up!
Laura: I thought you had a crush on her?
Ashley: Can he grab her and climb?
Matt: You can. She's not a big stone structure.
Travis: Okay, cool. I pick her up and start trying to climb up the rope.
Matt: Okay, so you rush, you grab the stone form.
Sam: Put her in the Bag of Holding!
All - sam - matt: No!
Travis: She's stone! It doesn't matter!
Orion: Don't do that!
Travis: I take her and-- oh, fine. I'll hold on to her.
Sam: No, put her in the bag!
Marisha: Can you make one of those baby slings? Stuff her in your belt?
Taliesin: It's not time for arts and crafts.
Matt: You run up. You grab Lady Kima. You grab her in your arms and you rush. The rope is currently dangling from this side where you guys first came in.
Laura: Stomp all over the brain to get to it.
Matt: 50 speed. You can get up to here. You can just get up to the rope and we'll say as your dash action you can begin to climb, if you'd like.
Travis: I would like to climb.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I would like to raise.
Travis: I would like to rage. Rage climb.
Matt: It gets you about there. Rage climbing like (grunts).
Orion: Yes!
Matt: One-handed up the rope. That's pretty intense. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Marisha: Yes. That Crossfit training come in handy.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. Yeah, it's sore. You know that arm is going to be dead tomorrow, but right now it doesn't even matter. You're just clutching Lady Kima, still locked in her attack pose, in one arm as you're overhand grabbing the rope and getting yourself up as fast as you can.
Travis: You better remember this when you wake up. (laughter)
Matt: Rage-climbing up the rope.
Liam: He's climbing the Cliffs of Insanity! (laughter)
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: I should just stay where I am, right guys?
Taliesin: And you should shoot things.
Laura: I'm going to do that, yes. Is there any other-- there's just a little brain in there right now?
Matt: Right now there's two brains, and you can see just in the outskirts of the temple's side here, two more illithid that are making their way up the side of the temple.
Laura: Oh, fuck me.
Matt: With about a hundred or so just now gathering towards the bottom of the temple base.
Laura: Jesus. We're going to get out of here real fast! You guys are listening to me, right? Because things are coming up the side and we need to get out of here.
Sam: But what if there's gold down there to find?
Laura: I don't give a fuck! I'm going to Hunter's Mark a little brain. Or should I keep attacking the Elder Brain? What do you guys think?
Taliesin: Elder Brain is spilling out the side now, isn't it?
Matt: The Elder Brain is still inside, just the stonework on the outside of it is currently knocked out.
Taliesin: Yeah, I have a carpet anyway, so let's just jump on it.
Liam: I mean, it might get sent reeling, that brain.
Laura: I know, that's why I'm kind of like, hm.
Liam: Maybe if-- we should try to get out of here, but maybe if we can frigging hurt that brain it'll stun them or send them reeling or something, or make them mad.
Laura: All right. I can do Hail of Thorns on it again, so I'll Hunter's Mark it and then I'll do Hail of Thorns on it.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 27.
Matt: That'll hit. Releasing again, in midair you can see all the thorns appear out the sides of the arrow shaft. It explodes into a giant conical-- just a ray, almost like a blizzard of thorns.
Liam: Get it.
Laura: I don't add-- do I add Hunter's Mark to that damage, or just my regular and then that?
Matt: At the end of all the damage you dealt with the attack, you then add Hunter's Mark to that.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Big money.
Laura: 22. 24.
Matt: 24, all righty. Keyleth, go ahead and make a reflex saving throw.
Marisha: What's happening?
Laura: Oh, right, because you're right next to it, sorry Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, it's okay. My reflex-- I use my dex modifier for my elemental, correct?
Matt: Or deflect, yeah, sorry, old carryover, it's dexterity.
Marisha: Ten.
Matt: Ten? Versus your spell save of--
Laura: 14.
Matt: Yeah, so you take the same damage. You take 24 points of damage.
Laura: Sorry. Oh right, you're really, really strong.
Marisha: Yeah, I've got 100 hit points still.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: So how many points? 21?
Matt: 24. So, all the thorns explode against your rocky physical form; you just shrug it off, like it's nothing. (laughs) It tickles a little.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm good.
Laura: So I'll try to-- I guess I'll just attack it again, because I've got nowhere else to go.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: 17?
Matt: All right, 17-- actually no, 17 will miss.
Laura: Oh really, with it oozing out and everything?
Matt: The second, there's some sort of psychic protective field in the brain. As you fire down, the arrow looks like it should strike and then it just arcs off to the side nonsensically, and then just splinters against the stonework next to the--
Laura: Fudge!
Travis: Fudge.
Matt: You going to stay where you are? You going to move?
Orion: Get on Trinket!
Laura: I'm going to climb onto Trinket for some reason, because that makes sense.
Matt: Okay, you climb onto Trinket's back. That brings us to Keyleth. You're up.
Marisha: Okay, what's the situation with the brain soup?
Matt: The liquid is poured out.
Marisha: And how are the brains? Are just brains just floating downstream?
Matt: No, it's actually all-- at a long distance, it looks like one giant brain, close up it looks like all of these smaller brains have all congealed into one giant mind.
Laura: It's like a jello mold of brains.
Marisha: Like a jello mold of a brain. And there's fluid coming out from underneath of it?
Matt: Yeah. Literally the fluid it was sitting in, it was mostly submerged in, is all now poured out onto the ground near you, beginning to get slick.
Marisha: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be like, phase under, phase down, and I'm going to get under where the brain would be, and I'm going to Superman punch it!
Laura: Yes!
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: From underneath.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an attack roll.
Travis: Come on, punch it in its big brain anus.
Marisha: 23!
Matt: 23, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: (laughs) 11? Wait, is that my--
Taliesin: No, 22.
Marisha: Oh, 22! You're right, 22.
Matt: It's not double damage, because you're not hitting the structure. So 11 points of damage? All right, now I want you to go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: Okay, that sounds fun.
Matt: So just roll and add your strength modifier of the earth elemental.
Marisha: 14?
Matt: Okay, as you punch upward, you're still partially absorbed into the earth, but your fist comes through and it slams in, and you feel this sickening thud sound as your fist hits the interior of the brain. It still moves a little bit but it stays in its place held aloft by its own psychic defense mechanism. Make your second attack.
Marisha: Okay, yeah, same, 21.
Matt: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that one.
Laura: Big damage!
Marisha: Come on.
Taliesin: Big money.
Marisha: Oh, that's better. 16.
Matt: 16 damage. Go ahead and roll another strength check.
Marisha: Eight.
Matt: Eight? Okay. Once again, you slam your fist into it and you feel like the impact is absorbed partially by the psychic field around the brain. It holds itself in place. It's still not moving from within that small--
Marisha: Do I stay or do I get out?
Laura: Get out.
Orion: Get out.
Matt: You still have about-- I'd say it only took you about 15 feet of movement to get underneath it.
Marisha: In my burrowing speed, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: So, I'm going to start burrowing up the side of the mountain-- up the side of the temple, so I can pop out next to them.
Matt: Okay, so we'll say 25, 30, 35, 40, 45. What's your total burrow speed?
Marisha: 60.
Matt: So you'll be about there.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So you're about as high as Tiberius is, partially up the wall.
Marisha: I'm in the wall.
Laura: They won't see you.
Travis: Vax, you're still on the floor, right?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Up on there. As you glance in, you kinda have a brief look at the outside of the wall and on the opposite side there are two other mind flayers. One more coming up on the side and another troll behind it. And the troll's slamming onto the bricks you left up. And these two illithids are starting to look up and see you moving up, and their eyes go up and they can see the opening in the top of the-- where the wall collapsed earlier. And they both look up and kinda start drifting up towards it. So that ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: What's the order after me?
Matt: Well, it's Percy, Pike, Vax, and then they go. Then Scanlan, Grog.
Taliesin: I was going to hold my turn to get everybody on the carpet.
Liam: I'm coming.
Orion: Okay, okay, good. I cast Fly at 5th level. I cast it on myself. I cast it on Grog. And I cast it on-- you're not there.
Laura: Trinket!
Orion: Trinket. (groans)
Travis: She's on Trinket.
Laura: So I can fly if I'm on Trinket, right?
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: Sweet!
Matt: All right, so Grog, Trinket, and--
Orion: Me.
Matt: Yourself. Okay.
Orion: And I (flying noise).
Matt: What's the fly speed on that?
Orion: Um, outside?
Liam: A skillion.
Orion: I dunno, it's right here. It's right here.
Matt: It's on the card, the cards I gave you.
Orion: The cards! Look at the cards. It's 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet. You make your way up top and you're now hovering. Trinket's now having another Peter Pan moment with you on his back awkwardly. It's just gotten used to flying on its own, that one time it had. Now it has an extra weight on its back. (bear noises)
Laura: You can do it, buddy. You can do it.
Ashley: You got it, Trink.
Matt: All right.
Orion: Oh wait, hold on-- I want to turn to to everybody and go, "Fly, you fools."
Matt: It's a free action, I'll let you do that. (laughs) Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm holding my turn.
Matt: You're holding back?
Taliesin: I'm holding my turn.
Matt: Okay. Percy, holding back. Pike, go ahead and make an intellect saving throw.
Laura: Yes!
Ashley: 19.
Matt: 19. You finally shrug off the effect of the Mind Blast. Your eyes clarify.
Sam: Does she fall in love with the first thing she sees? (laughter)
Matt: (laughs) The first thing you do see is Scanlan holding you. You're now outside of the temple. There's the dark, kind of dull glowing green atmosphere outside the entire Yug'Voril city around you, with bits of blue crystal, you know, against the cavern walls. It's scary. You look around you, you can see illithid charging up the side of the temple, just gliding toward you angrily. You look forward and on your shoulders, clutching you, is Scanlan, blood streaking down the front of his face with a big smile.
Ashley: (gasps) Scanlan, are you hurt?
Sam: I'm fine, baby. How are you?
Ashley: I'm great. Well, not really, but I'm just going to pretend I'm happy so that everybody can be okay. (laughter)
Orion: That's right, Pike. Bury it deep inside.
Ashley: Well, can I do a spell? Okay, Mass Cure Wounds.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: For the, well, hold on a minute. How low is everybody? Not really that low?
Laura: Nobody's really low.
Travis: I'm at 32.
Ashley: He's pretty low.
Taliesin: You two are the only ones.
Laura: Yeah. Can you cast something on Kima? Oh, no. We should just keep her stone for now.
Sam: You're low. You're super low.
Laura: Yeah, cast it on yourself, man.
Travis: Heal yourself.
Taliesin: She can hold this part of her turn until everybody's up there.
Matt: Mass Cure Wounds on yourself? Because Mass Cure Wounds is for multiple people.
Ashley: No, can I just do--
Matt: You can cast Cure Wounds on yourself.
Ashley: I can?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: But he needs it, too.
Matt: It's your choice. It's also touch. You have to be next to him to do that.
Ashley: Shit.
Travis: Just do your thing. You need it.
Ashley: All right, I need it? Oh no.
Matt: At six hit points, I'd recommend it to you.
Travis: The DM recommends it. (laughter)
Matt: You were so close to dying again. I was so scared.
Travis: I stringently urge you.
Liam: Four out of five DMs recommend. (laughter)
Ashley: All right, 17.
Matt: Okay, so you heal yourself 17 hit points. You clutch your holy symbol. You feel the warmth fill your body and your wounds seal up slowly. You feel a little better, because you were on death's door there. All right. You want to move at all? Anything else you want to do this turn or are you good?
Ashley: Now I'm at 23. Wait, so bonus action?
Orion: Get on the bear!
Laura: No, he can't--
Matt: You don't have to.
Ashley: He can "bear-ly" hold one. (groans and laughter)
Laura: Ba dum tss.
Ashley: I can't do that, right?
Matt: What?
Ashley: I can't get on Trinket?
Matt: Right now, Trinket can barely hold Vex.
Ashley: So as a bonus action, I'll give Scanlan a kiss on his cheek.
Sam: Oh! Do I get an inspiration for that?
Matt: You do. (laughter)
Matt: A d6 inspiration dice.
Sam: I'm never going to wash it again.
Orion: You never wash it to begin with.
Matt: It's this strangely romantic moment as she reaches forward, grabs him and kisses him on the cheek and pulls away and he looks at her with this beautiful smile, and then the sound effects kick in again, of the bats screeching ahead and the (inhales) of all the illithid swarming up the side of the temple.
Marisha: Oh god, we're still in a war zone!
Ashley: Oh no, we got to get it together.
Matt: All right, Vax.
Liam: Okay, I run up the dais, land on the brain. I'm on my way, but before I go, I'm going to kiss you goodbye. Dagger, dagger, dagger. Stabbing into the brain before I leap onto the carpet. So here I go. First one-- misses. Second one is a 25.
Matt: 25, okay.
Liam: Which gets nine damage.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And last dagger is a 13.
Matt: No.
Liam: Okay, so I'll give him a little cut, a little nick, and then jump on the flying carpet.
Matt: Jump on the flying carpet. All righty.
Liam: And I grab Percy around the neck and kiss him on the cheek, and say, "Let's get out of here, you bastard."
Taliesin: Do I get an inspiration point for that? (laughter)
Matt: No.
Laura: That's a double standard.
Taliesin: You know how I feel about you.
Liam: Fight the patriarchy.
Matt: Down the road, maybe. This is the start of something beautiful.
Taliesin: I'm feeling something new.
Matt: Let the seeds germinate for a while. Then the dice may come naturally. So you're holding your turn? Percy, you want to go now?
Taliesin: I want to go now.
Matt: All right. So, that brings you here. Percy, go ahead.
Taliesin: I'm just going to reel straight up. And on my way up, I'm going to take two more shots at the brain.
Matt: Okay, okay. We'll say here for the purposes of this. Taking two more shots?
Taliesin: 16.
Liam: Oh, I'm suffocating in the brain!
Matt: Oh no, it's fallen over. What's the first roll?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 does hit. Oh, it's not even flat, okay. We're just going to put it down there.
Taliesin: And 19.
Matt: 16 doesn't hit. The 19 just barely hits it. It pierces through the psychic barrier. (zoomf) The bullet sinking again into the fleshy membrane.
Taliesin: The second one has a bonus die, yay.
Matt: Ice shot.
Taliesin: Ice shot.
Marisha: Maybe you'll freeze it.
Liam: Percy and Vax, ship it!
Taliesin: That's 13 points plus two points of ice damage.
Matt: Okay, so 16 total. All right. As it blasts inside, you can see the ice, these strange crystals of frozen liquid, they burst out, almost like it actually freezes the blue explosion in place for a moment, and then the ice just slowly melts away. Yeah, there's some damage dealt to it, but this is a hardy sack of hit points. And it's coming online. So with the end of your turn, the brain, now taken a bunch of hits, begins to pulse with energy, now that it's been freed from its control and it's slowly brought itself out of this trance-like slumber that it was placed in by K'Varn. The Elder Brain is now becoming conscious once again.
Liam: Oh dear.
Taliesin: Can we go up there? Can you put us at our height now? (laughter)
Marisha: Can you represent us accurately?
Matt: So at a 30-foot radius, which you guys are, it gives off a pulse of energy, (boomf) this giant psychic burst of purple-ish, psychic blast just cascades out of the center and just fills the room for a second with this large dull thud-like "thoom" sound. All of you instinctively look down and see this explosion that just dissipates as it crests the bottom of the magic carpet, which is just out of range.
Taliesin: You're wearing the helmet, at least.
Matt: At which point, you guys who are at the top, looking off to the side, all the illithid that are rushing up the tunnel, there's a sudden flash of purple energy in their eyes simultaneously. Like now the Elder Brain has come back online and has reconnected with its people.
Laura: Out, out, out!
Matt: All right, that brings us to Grog. Grog.
Travis: I can keep flying up?
Matt: All of the sudden, the rope is really easy to go up. It's nothing, you're just going hand over hand.
Orion: You can fly, Grog!
Travis: I have one more level three, whatever it's called, level three healing potion. They're called called superior or something? What's the word for it?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I'd like to take that.
Marisha: I have so much adrenaline during these kind of fights.
Taliesin: I know.
Matt: They're moving around, they're angry, they can't quite get to their targets.
Travis: I heal 24 points of hit damage.
Matt: Fantastic. Rolling for the bottom of the attack round. Okay. The troll bursts through the door, filling in with the two mind flayers behind it. They both look up, frustrated. And both begin to drift up.
Laura: No!
Matt: As far as they can get.
Travis: Fuck this house of horrors.
Ashley: How do we get out of here?
Laura: How are we going to get out of here?
Matt: They are going to attempt two Mind Blasts. All right. That's as high as they get with levitation. With the full height that takes the top, because technically you guys are up here, I just couldn't put the structure that high up. The only people-- The only person that's in the radius would be Scanlan and Pike. Again.
Ashley: All right.
Matt: Both of you guys make intellect saving throws again.
Sam: I'm just looking into her eyes the whole time.
Ashley: Can you sing?
Marisha: You've got that inspiration die.
Sam: Oh, I do. I don't need it though.
Matt: What did you roll?
Sam: I'm at 20.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: 14.
Matt: 14? All right.
Sam: Can I sing for her?
Matt: (laughs) Unfortunately, you have to do that on your turn. You manage to resist the effects of it. You take 22 points of psychic damage and once again your brain clenches--
Laura: Good thing you healed yourself, Pike!
Matt: Damn good thing you healed yourself.
Sam: She was at 23! That's 22. That's one point!
Laura: Yeah. That's the second time this round.
Matt: You feel all of the sudden, the blast hits you and you see her eyes roll back in her head as she reaches up and grabs the side of her head again, nearly dropping her shield and mace, which you manage to catch before they clatter down into the temple.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: Baby, come on.
Ashley: Maybe we'll be okay?
Marisha: Do you want some more dice?
Matt: All right, Grog, you're up. Oh no, you're up there, they went. That brings it to the top of the round. Vex, you're up.
Marisha: Take it, take it. Give it to her, please.
Orion: Head to the beach!
Sam: Wait, top of the round?
Matt: Yeah, we're at the very top now. At the very end, the new guys burst in and attacked.
Laura: I'm going to-- (sighs) Is that brain fluid still floating around it? Like, out and stuff?
Travis: Well, we woke it up.
Laura: I know.
Liam: But now it's awake, so--
Matt: Percy shot-- No, actually, you didn't do your turn on that one. I'm sorry, I think we skipped Scanlan.
Sam: Should I kill the brain, or try to kill the brain?
Liam: If you can also flee at the same time.
Orion: Well, he has to wait for the carpet.
Sam: The brain is down there in the puddle? In the pool? Is that big scaffolding still hanging over it?
Matt: It's currently dangling over to this side. Because it's been busted from three different corners and it's precariously hanging.
Sam: But it's not right over the thing?
Laura: But it might fall and tip.
Sam: Or it could not.
Ashley: Could somebody also use Telekinesis to pull it to fall the other way?
Orion: I do not have the necessary item to do two concentration spells at once.
Sam: Is it super heavy?
Matt: It's pretty heavy. It probably weighs close to 700 to 1,000 pounds.
Marisha: What does?
Matt: The giant brass structure.
Sam: And how high above it is it? Like, would it get a significant amount of force?
Matt: It would fall down and then topple over.
Sam: Unless I made it fall--
Matt: Unless you made it fall. In that case, we'll see.
Sam: Do I do that or do I just Lightning Strike? Okay.
Liam: It's your decision.
Marisha: Go bold!
Travis: Do what you were going to do. Do it.
Sam: I'm feeling handsy. (laughter)
Sam: (sings) Bigby's Hand! So I take Bigby's Hand and I sort of try to wrench it off the last thing that's holding it up, but in the direction of the--
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Of the brain.
Matt: Go ahead and make a roll, adding your plus five for your casting ability.
Sam: Well, that's not good.
Orion: And inspiration!
Sam: Oh, yeah! Okay, so that makes it 13 plus what?
Matt: 13 plus five, which is your charisma.
Sam: Okay, then 18.
Matt: 18. As the spectral Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs the top of the structure, you can see the weird bit of bent metal that was once part of the mostly-destroyed structure that held it aloft in the center of the temple (metal creaking) wrenches forth and snaps as the entire structure begins to be pulled at an angle.
Sam: (sings) It's Bigby's Hand.
Matt: It slams down at an angle into the side of the brain and coming to rest on top, crushing even further the corpse of Clarota, currently smeared across the ground. Oh, man. Go ahead and roll 6d6 force damage on that. Crushing damage, as this heavy thing jams itself into the brain.
Liam: Six cubes, Sam, six cubes.
Sam: Orion's my dice bimbo.
Orion: Here you go, boss.
Ashley: There you go, boss!
Sam: 16.
Matt: 16, so the structure slams into the Elder Brain, and you can see like a bit of purplish black liquid kinda squirts out to one side and for the first time you can see a part of the brain is actually torn open, and the purplish glow that you see throbbing in the middle of its folds is now visible from the interior. You can see now, it's taken some real damage. Immediately the two mind flayers that were floating up look down, freaked out, and begin moving towards the brain now, instinctively, to defend it.
Sam: And bonus action, can I pour some superior healing potion down Pike's beautiful throat?
Matt: You can. (laughter)
Matt: I'm not going anywhere with that.
Taliesin: Yeah, no.
Sam: I'm just pouring my potion down Pike's throat.
Matt: Anyway. All right, so Vex, what're you doing?
Sam: I don't know what superior is.
Matt: Oh, it's a superior one, superior goes to, it's 8d4 plus eight.
Sam: Do I roll or does she?
Matt: You roll.
Sam: Oh!
Matt: It's your potion.
Sam: 8d4 plus eight.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Holy bajeez. One.
Matt: Five, nine, 13.
Sam: 15, 18, 21.
Matt: 15, 18, 21.
Matt: One more.
Sam: 22.
Matt: Plus eight, 30. You heal 30 hit points.
Ashley: What? Awesome.
Sam: I got some good potion.
Matt: Very, very expensive potion used. All right, so. Vex? You're on Trinket still, do you want to hold your action and wait for the rest of the carpet, do you want to attack anyone, what do you want to do?
Laura: I want to attack the Elder Brain.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Laura: I'm going to-- I think all I can do is a Conjure Barrage.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: So it's the cone of attack.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: So that will get hopefully all the things, because I'm shooting down, right?
Matt: Well, how big is the cone?
Laura: It's 60 feet.
Matt: 60-foot cone from your angle here, if you're going for the brain it'll catch this guy, maybe, as a cone that goes down this way.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Unless you want to go this way and hit these guys, or this guy.
Liam: You could get the edge of the brain.
Laura: Yeah, can I do the edge on the brain and get--
Matt: Yeah. You can get, you can get probably these guys there.
Laura: All right, let's do that.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So they get saving throws, right? How does that work?
Laura: Yes, they get saving throws.
Matt: So roll damage, and we'll see what their saving throws are.
Laura: Okay. But do I have to roll to see if it hits, or it just hits?
Matt: No, for that one, it's just a barrage and they get to roll a saving throw against it.
Laura: Oh! Okay, cool. 17?
Matt: All right.
Laura: Plus Hunter's Mark? On the Elder Brain.
Matt: Yeah, so the Elder Brain takes additional damage.
Laura: Three additional. Do I get plus two for the bracers on that Conjure Barrage?
Matt: Technically, yes you would, because they're ranged.
Laura: Okay, so that would've been 19.
Matt: 19. All right. Cool. And then this guy fails its save, so total damage on him?
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19 on him? Okay. So it's still alive, just looking really, really rough. The brain's just now pierced with a bunch of arrows, some of it, it's barely holding itself on top of its feet. And the troll also takes the damage as well, just seems to shrug it off, just seems to angrily-- roars up from the bottom of the temple at you, now seemingly helpless in the current circumstance.
Laura: So then I want to attack the Elder Brain again.
Matt: All right. So you release it down.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Very nice, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: All right. 11.
Matt: 11 points of damage, all right.
Laura: Oh, wait, wait! No, lies! 13.
Matt: 13, okay, there we go.
Travis: (laughs) No, lies.
Matt: (laughs) Reach down again, release this one, aiming towards the now torn-open wound on the side of the Elder Brain as the arrow now sinks in, there's another pulse of purple energy, and you hear, all of you simultaneously in your heads this scream, this screech (screech) that echoes through your heads. As it does, the two illithid that were hovering towards it grab their heads momentarily out of frustration and glare up at you angrily.
Orion: Ooh! I took notice of this.
Matt: That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm going to take the rest of my burrow speed to get up to the top.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I'm assuming I'm there?
Matt: You just manage to make it to the top of the temple, yeah.
Marisha: Okay. Drop earth elemental.
Matt: All right. Keyleth is on the field.
Marisha: Would you say--
Sam: Oh boy. (laughter)
Matt: Nothing good ever comes out of this. What do you got, Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Theoretically.
Matt: Theoretically?
Marisha: Our brains are made up of water, right? Would you say that there is water in the like jello brain mold, like water molecules would be in it?
Matt: Make an arcana check.
Marisha: Okay. I don't know much in terms of arcana, but I can try. Ten.
Matt: You have no idea. You have never encountered an Elder Brain before.
Laura: Yeah, give it a try!
Taliesin: Give it a try!
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to cast Control Water. I'm going to assume that there's water, it's 300 feet, I got the range and I'm going to take the brain where it's already kind of sliced down the middle where Vex has already made progress, I'm going to take it and I'm just going to rip it apart.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier to it.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Wait, you're saying brains are made of water?
Taliesin: Whoa!
Marisha: 23.
Matt: Okay. There is an element of liquid to its structure, however it is difficult to extract it from a form that you're unfamiliar with, let alone one that's this stable. You manage to find a way to pull moisture out of parts of it and actually deal damage to it as you're beginning to shrivel sections of the brain. Go ahead and roll 3d6. You do 3d6 points of dehydration damage.
Marisha: I'll take it, I'll take it.
Ashley: Make some brain jerky.
Marisha: They'll have a really bad hangover tomorrow.
Matt: Oh yeah. Oh, you don't even know the half of it.
Marisha: Ooh! Just 3d6 or plus anything?
Matt: Just 3d6.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: 15, all right. 15 points of dehydration damage to the Elder Brain. You can see now the portion of the wound that's been opened, the corners of it kind of shrivel in and tuck in and the actual purple glow in the inside dulls slightly. And you now have, currently, in the air, a small amorphous globule of brain fluid that's just kind of floating there in this, in the air.
Ashley: Awesome.
Laura: Gross.
Marisha: Cool. (laughter)
Marisha: Scanlan, smell it! Smell it!
Sam: No, thank you.
Matt: Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Did you say there was illithid coming up on the sides, too?
Matt: Yeah, they're swarming up the side. They're probably about halfway up.
Orion: Okay. I turn to the group. I suggest we go to the beach immediately. There we can shore up defenses and I can cast a spell and get us out of here. As I say that, I go (fwwt) and throw a Fireball right at that fucker's head.
Matt: Okay. Are you using your movement to bring the carpet, to take control of the carpet from Percy and move it up higher?
Orion: No, I'm up top. I have Fly on myself.
Matt: Oh, that's right. Sorry. Yeah. All right, so.
Orion: Yeah, I just let a Fireball down on the brain.
Matt: Into the brain, all right. All right, so that's enough to get both of these guys. Go ahead and roll damage. And they both failed their save, so full damage.
Travis: Crush the nuts.
Ashley: Little brains.
Matt: I like that, good.
Orion: 40.
Matt: 40?
Laura: Whoa!
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: Those incinerate. And 40 points of damage to the Elder Brain as this giant echoing explosion blasts up from below. All of you at the top, you are underlit momentarily from the flash of red and yellow flame. As you look down, there's now a sizzling sound and this like smell of horrible burnt flesh as part of the Elder Brain now that was originally dehydrated is now also burnt and singed. You can see now, it's looking a little rougher and it's very very unhappy with its current circumstance.
Laura: I want to kill it before we leave now.
Matt: All right. Pike, go ahead and make a saving throw.
Marisha: Come on, Pike!
Laura: Why a saving throw?
Matt: Still trying to get rid of the stun.
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: So intellect saving throw.
Ashley: 16?
Matt: 16. You shrug off the effect--
Ashley: Yeah! Man. Thanks, Keyleth. Much better now.
Marisha: New dice!
Sam: What? I've been doing it wrong this whole time.
Ashley: Can I do anything, or that's my turn?
Matt: That's your turn.
Orion: My movement, by the way is I head to the beach.
Sam: You're ghosting?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: You just get the fuck out of Dodge, Tiberius is that way.
Ashley: Wait, where do we go? Nobody's taking us?
Laura: No, you've got to hop on the carpet when it comes up.
Ashley: Oh, okay, got it.
Marisha: Classic Tiberius.
Taliesin: All right, here's a question  can everybody still fly?
Matt: Vax?
Orion: As long as I'm thinking about it.
Liam: Well I'm still sitting, still kneeling on the flying carpet with Percy, so I'm just throwing daggers at the bacon brain.
Matt: Okay. They're at disadvantage at this distance.
Liam: Okay. So that means, aw man, 17 on the first.
Matt: 17? (ricochet sound) Reflected, deflected by the arcane shield on the brain.
Liam: All right, so then the second one does as well, and the last one definitely does, so.
Matt: Yeah, so all three just (ping, ping, ping).
Taliesin: Take the wheel!
Matt: As it gets more and more damaged, it's waking up more and more and it looks like it's actually gaining power the more it does.
Liam: Okay, and then Percy yelled in my ear, so I take some of the little carpet tassels.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. So as your movement, you manage to move the carpet all the way up, it swoops up into the center of--
Laura: Grab the gnomes!
Matt: This right here. You guys are all looking precariously at this carpet that is now floating up from the center of the temple. As you get to the top, you look over and you can see there's probably close to 20 mind flayers that are swarming up the side. That brings us to, Vax, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I pull out Bad News. And I'm going to lie down on my stomach, hanging off the edge of the carpet.
Sam: Hanging brain!
Taliesin: And I'm taking a shot straight down.
Matt: Okay. I'll say it takes you your--
Taliesin: My movement.
Matt: Movement to get it out. So you're there, you're unable to move the carpet, you pull the Bad News out, you get down, you're precariously off the side of it, and it is sagging as your weight touches it, you get ready, go ahead and fire.
Taliesin: Firing a deadshot.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, come on.
Taliesin: That's 18.
Matt: As you fire, the blast sends you up almost onto your feet on the carpet again, and you hear this impact sound, this (crash) of the blast hitting stone as the psychic field around it deflects the bullet, sending it into the ground.
Laura: I thought 18 was the number that we were aiming for-- shit.
Taliesin: Wait, did I have an inspiration dice from last-- fuck.
Orion: You did.
Taliesin: I did have an inspiration dice from last game! I did! What do you give people with it?
Sam: d10.
Taliesin: d10? Oh fuck, that's right.
Orion: Can he add it now?
Matt: Yeah, I'll trust you on that.
Taliesin: I did! I did, because I'm always excited when I get them, because I never get them.
Matt: That's true, okay, yeah. All right. Go ahead and roll for that.
Taliesin: 21!
Matt: That'll do it.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: As the brain continues to wake up, it improves its defenses, improves its capabilities--
Laura: Oh, I understand.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: But that will hit. So go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: Okay.
Orion: It's Hulking?
Matt: Essentially. So as you release the blast, it hits the psychic field, the first impact you hear is it hitting the psychic field and pushing through into the actual brain matter.
Marisha: Come on!
Taliesin: Let me double-check that I'm doing this right, hold on, deadshot's weird. Plus weapon damage. Okay, so that's eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13... 25 points of damage.
Matt: 25 points of damage. Boom! You see the section of it that's kinda charred and burned gets blown off, and now there's a corner of the brain that's just an open and gaping wound. The purplish glow on the inside is pulsing more and more angrily. It's taken a beating, but it's hanging in there.
Taliesin: Oh my god!
Marisha: Will not die.
Matt: This is, you guys have left a good mark on it. You get the sensation, with the swarming incoming, you may start to consider self-preservation, because the Elder Brain looks like it's taken some hits, but it's not on death's door yet.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Marisha: Let's get out.
Laura: We need to go.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Scanlan is up?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: We're out of here?
Taliesin: We need everybody to hop on the carpet first.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: You're hopping up?
Sam: No, I'm going to turn into a huge pterodactyl and carry some folks.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: What?
Laura: You can do that?
Sam: Sure, why not?
Marisha: He's got Polymorph.
Travis: Yeah, turn into a batwing.
Matt: Cool, so we'll say for the time being, we'll use this as Scanlan.
Sam: Great.
Matt: You are a giant pterodactyl, a creature that you've read in books in the past, you haven't actually seen in person. And what are you doing?
Sam: Who can I carry?
Matt: You can carry one person with your claws. You haven't used this form before, and this is you figuring it out, so pick one and you can take them with you.
Sam: I'm going to take someone heavy.
Liam: Grog.
Matt: Grog can fly.
Laura: I can fly on Trinket, yeah, everybody's covered, man.
Sam: There's only one person I can take.
Matt: As the pterodactyl Scanlan swoops down and both its claws grapple on your arms and lift you off the top of the temple, flying after Tiberius.
Taliesin: How do you make that weird?
Matt: All right, so they're now out of harm's way. Very top of the round, that brings us to Grog. Still carrying Kima under your arm.
Travis: We're getting out, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: So I don't have to worry, so up and out.
Matt: So you just awkwardly fly with Kima under your arm, off with the rest of the group.
Liam: (sings) Sweet bird of prey, fly, fly away.
Sam: (sings) Up, up, and away, I'm a beautiful pterodactyl.
Matt: We'll get these guys off the board here because you do have two Illithid that get up to the edge here. They're going to attempt a Mind Blast.
Liam: We're gone, man, we're gone!
Laura: Not yet.
Matt: Still holding back. So--
Liam: I jump up to get out of range.
Matt: That can just get Trinket and Vex, if you can go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw for both of you.
Liam: Don't fuck with my sister.
Orion: Trinket and Vex are still there?
Laura: Yeah. I know, I didn't get to--
Sam: They never flew.
Laura: I know, I didn't use the movement on the last turn.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: I just didn't say it because I'm an asshole.
Sam: You are.
Liam: What kind of saving throw?
Matt: Intelligence.
Sam: Intelligence.
Laura: Ten? On me.
Matt: Okay. Roll for Trinket.
Liam: You rolled nine, plus two is 11.
Laura: Oh. Okay. 11.
Matt: So go ahead and roll for Trinket.
Laura: Oh! I rolled a nine, plus two, plus two.
Liam: For what?
Laura: For my ring that I'm wearing.
Liam: Okay.
Laura: So whatever that was.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 13.
Liam: 13.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: For me.
Matt: And roll for Trinket.
Laura: Which is going to be a major fail because Trinket is the dumbest. (laughter)
Sam: Don't talk about Trinket like that.
Travis: Is he the dumbest?
Laura: No, that's a minus four. So that would be a nine for Trinket.
Matt: Nine for Trinket.
Laura: Who is, by the way, my only way to get out of here right now.
Matt: So communally, both you and Trinket freeze in place, and Trinket, who is flying, slumps onto the top of the temple, limply laying across the edge, about to tip over off the temple.
Sam: (whispering) Told you we should've left Trinket behind.
Matt: That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: A lot of Sandmen in there.
Marisha: Well first and foremost I'm going to get on the carpet.
Matt: Okay. So you leap up here with these guys.
Marisha: Secondly, I am going to-- Okay, wait, Trinket's stunned?
Matt: Trinket is currently catatonic (moans), just barely holding herself right there. You can see she's struggling with the flight spell, like she's kind of levering herself into the ground--
Laura: Trinket's a boy.
Matt: Him, sorry. I was thinking of you.
Laura: If he's about to die, at least get his gender right.
Matt: I apologize, Trinket. I'm sorry.
Marisha: Wait, shove him?
Taliesin: Shove him onto the carpet.
Marisha: No, I can't shove him.
Sam: Wait, he's floating.
Marisha: Okay, can I do this? Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm on the carpet. I'm going to cast Grasping Vine from the carpet and wrap around Trinket and have a Trinket tow vine.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Like the Macy's Day parade!
Matt: So as you leap onto the carpet, you reach down, and the fibrous nature that the carpet was originally made from, you manage to pull the essence of that out to create a vine of similarly patterned color of the actual magic carpet material. The various silks form into this tendril that wraps around both you and Trinket and pulls you guys hanging behind the carpet, so you guys are essentially now towed to the carpet.
Marisha: Let's go!
Orion: Can she take control of the carpet, too?
Marisha: Can I now use the rest of my movement to be like--
Matt: You currently do not have control of the carpet because you used your action and everything to use that spell and your concentration at that point.
Marisha: Okay, I'm just holding.
Matt: You're just holding them there. That brings us to Tiberius, you're off, flying off. Pike is off, Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm steering us the fuck outta here, man.
Matt: You tow Trinket and Vex out behind. As you guys pull off at full speed, the rest of the illithid swarm to the top, you can see about 15 or so get to the front top here, look down at the Elder Brain, look up at the rest of you with this angry look, and as you're pulling away, your eyes adjust to the darkness of the cavern and you look down and you swear you can see hundreds and hundreds of sets of purple glowing eyes just staring up from the city as you all slowly fly away to the far end of the cavern. As you're moving, so are the eyes.
Laura: (sings) We've made some enemies. They're coming after us.
Orion: I want to make a note, because I'm way ahead of everybody at this point, as soon as I land on the beach, I cast Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Barring that there's nobody there, but I do that immediately.
Matt: All right, so. A few minutes go by, you guys are moving past and over the water channel that's between the north side of the island and the beach where you guys previously set. (laughter)
Matt: As Tiberius, you land on the dirt. You land, immediately begin casting the Circle of Teleportation, you begin scrawling this circle on the ground, running your finger across the gravel surface to build the runes. As your fingers drag across, you can see the arcane light beginning to glow and form the sigils and the runes as you're drawing them feverishly. The rest of the group eventually catches up to you about 30 seconds into it. As you all eventually get back, you and Trinket manage to shrug off the effect. And you find yourselves halfway through being towed by this vine awkwardly.
Laura: What is happening right now?
Marisha: Stupid wrench.
Matt: A few seconds pass, you finish the incantation, you place your hand down on the center of the sigil, this wave of arcane energy blasts off, and suddenly, above this circle, this tearing sound pulls out of the middle of the ether, and this kind of purple shimmering doorway opens above the circle sigil that he crafted on the side of the beach.
Orion: By the blessings of Bahamut, I choose Emon!
Matt: At which point, the doorway that he just created takes some sort of a solid form and from what you can see on the other side, there appears to be some sort of low-lit room.
Liam: Greyskull!
Laura: (gasps) Greyskull!
Orion: I run right through.
Matt: All right. Tiberius runs through. Everyone else?
All: Yes!
Sam: Are we there?
Matt: You guys have all landed on the beach as he finished casting this, yeah.
Laura: Run!
Marisha: Run!
Matt: You all rush through the portal, one after the other, towards the very end is Grog, you bringing up the rear, holding Kima, you go rushing towards it as it begins to slowly close, this only lasts a round, you barrel through just in time as it closes behind you with a sparking sound.
Taliesin: We are time bandits. (cheering)
Travis: Oh, fuck. I just caked my pants.
Taliesin: Squish-squish.
Laura: I hate that phrase.
Orion: That was something, now, wasn't it?
Taliesin: That was fantastic.
Travis: Chocolate cake.
Matt: You all emerge within a small 20-foot-by-20-foot white stone chamber. You all are kinda crammed in this space currently, but you are all apparently safe and sound. As the doorway closes behind you, you turn and look, and on the ground there is a similar circle across the stone flooring, different patterns, different, you know, arrangement to the one that he had drawn, but with some similarities that are kind of a reminiscent glow, almost like a code to this circle, fade away, based on what he had drawn previously.
Laura: They won't be able to open that back up?
Orion: We are safe.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Just a quick request  she is made of stone. Holding Lady Kima.
Ashley: Yes! I'll go over and cast Greater Restoration on Kima.
Orion: Hold on just one second.
Travis: Hold on.
Orion: We still have the Horn to deal with.
Taliesin: The Horn is on the carpet. It has been specifically not touched.
Matt: So it's just kind of sitting there. The carpet's bunched to the side now as you guys kind of flew into the portal and kind of left it there and the Horn's just resting there.
Orion: I think we should get it out of her view before--
Taliesin: I think we should put it in the Bag of Holding.
Travis: Sure, yeah. Do you want to teleport it in the bag?
Ashley: If your crushing couldn't kill it, the thousand pounds?
Orion: We can store it there.
Liam: Where are we? You said we're in a room.
Matt: It's a small yellow room, sorry, a small white stone room and there is a kind of yellowish brown stone doorway that is closed. There's some very faint white orbs that are locked into the wall. So you're not in Greyskull Keep now.
Marisha: Oh, we're not in Greyskull.
Matt: You guys don't have a teleportation circle installed in your Keep yet. You don't know where you are.
Sam: We're in a room right now?
Matt: You're in a room, you're in a 20-foot-by-20-foot room, with two small white orbs on the sides that are kinda set into the walls to give off a faint white arcane glow. There's a single doorway that exits the room that is currently closed.
Orion: The way Circle of Teleportation works is when I learned it I get to pick two locations that I know innately. I picked Emon as one of them.
Laura: Oh, okay. Okay.
Marisha: So we're somewhere in Emon.
Orion: But I just had to pick the two.
Marisha: So we could be in someone's living room right now?
Orion: I'll use Telekinesis to lift the Horn off the carpet.
Matt: Okay. You still have the spells?
Orion: Yeah, I can burn one from my Ioun stone.
Laura: Should we wrap it at all?
Taliesin: It'll be fine in the Bag of Holding.
Liam: Not knowing what else to do, Vax is going to go to the door and just inspect it, see if it's trapped.
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. All right, the door does appear to be locked. It is not trapped.
Liam: Not trapped. Okay, I'll get to work on it, then. 32.
Matt: Okay, 32. You, relatively easy, the door comes unlocked, the small, it's like a very very intricately carved brass handle that has swirls upon it, like it's almost like a burst of wind being blown and frozen in gold. You turn it and the door opens slightly.
Liam: Pull up, I'm still wearing my tin hat and I pull up my hood from my elven cloak, and I go stealth. And I am stealthed, because that's a 32. And I have a look around outside the door.
Matt: Okay. As you open the doorway, it leads into a secondary chamber. This is an 80-foot-diameter circular chamber now, so you're entering the edge of a giant circle. There are a series of other doors, almost in respective rows next to each other, and you also see, in the center of the room, a vibrant chandelier made of white crystal like the spheres you saw in the previous room you were in, giving off a warm, atmospheric glow to the entire room. In the center of the room, there is a semi-circle desk that is also made of a similar white stone material that the rest of the room is made out of, with polished gold leaf trimming on the edge, and you do see what looks to be an elven man sitting at the desk, longish gray-white hair, he's wearing robes that are finely dressed, and he's half-falling asleep at a desk with a series of books kind of piled up on the side. As soon as the doorway opens, he looks up, and you hear a slight little arcane tinging sound, like a little bell being rung, as you open the door. He looks up for a second.
Laura: Say hello.
Liam: Yes yes yes. I just walk forward and pull down the cloak and say, "Hello."
Matt: "Stay right where you are! Do not move!"
Liam: Hands up in the air.
Matt: "Do not move!"
Liam: Nothing in them. No threat, no danger here. A little lost, apparently.
Matt: "Apparently."
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "Who else is in, who else goes there? Who else, please, step outside! Reveal yourselves!"
Liam: They're--
Laura: Hi!
Marisha: Hi.
Ashley: Hello.
Sam: (pterodactyl screech)
Matt: As soon as he sees you, he goes, (screams).
Orion: I cast Dispel Magic on Scanlan.
Sam: Do you have it anymore?
Orion: Yeah, I do.
Sam: You just did it to me earlier in this round.
Orion: No, Counterspell, and I Silenced you, this is Dispel Magic, which ends your spell.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Sam: Oh. Hello.
Matt: So as you cast the spell and transform, he stops in the middle of casting a spell reflexively and goes, "Oh. And a bear. Interesting."
Orion: He's friendly.
Sam: He's real.
Liam: I have a very long, very strange story, every word of which is true, and if you will give me five minutes, I swear I can convince you--
Matt: He opens a book and starts thumbing through the pages.
Liam: No ill intent. Intent? Yes.
Matt: "We have no expected arrivals at this hour. I need to know your business, your names, and your affiliations immediately."
Marisha: We will totally do that when we know--
Laura: We are affiliated with the king.
Liam: Yeah, emperor. Just tell the emperor that Vox Machina has returned from Kraghammer, and we have news for him, and--
Matt: "Well."
Laura: We were on very secret business for the crown, actually. And that is why you weren't informed of our business.
Orion: Yeah, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. How are you?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Did you wink?
Orion: I'm responsible for casting the spell to get us here to begin with.
Laura: (laughs) With advantage.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: That would be a 20-- no. 35.
Matt: All right. He looks to you, as you guys are saying, he--
Laura: That's not possible. 25.
Matt: 25. (laughter)
Matt: He stands up from the desk and gives you all a look-over and says, "Well, I am Gatekeeper Xanthas, I am the evening keeper of the Traverse Junction here in the-- it's the Traverse Junction."
Orion: Gatekeeper?
Matt: "Here within the Lyceum. The hour is late. We are two hours past midnight."
Taliesin: Well, I am Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, and, hello, and we would love to report to the emperor of your great hospitality at this unfortunately early hour, and we would look forward to reporting of all of your kindness and good housekeeping.
Liam: I imagine he would be very upset if we were delayed. We come with very grave news.
Taliesin: I would hope not to imagine it.
Matt: "Well. I'm certain the Headmaster would like to know your business in the morning."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Headmaster Thurmond. He runs this Alabaster Lyceum within the Erudite Quarter. If you would please submit a report for your reasons for using the Lyceum Junction property by tomorrow, I'm sure that would suffice for the required paperwork."
Laura: Of course we will.
Taliesin: You are too kind.
Laura: In the meantime, we'll just go to our Keep that we have in town.
Orion: Greyskull Keep.
Matt: Gives you a very, a disbelieving look and kinda goes, "Very well."
Taliesin: Good day, good evening.
Sam: I cast Friends on him and I tell him, "You know of our Keep, don't you?"
Matt: Okay. He goes, "I seem to recall hearing about a Vox Machina at some point discussed, but I don't get out very often. Running the graveyard shift here at the Lyceum has taken its toll on my social life."
Laura: You poor thing, you should get out more.
Matt: "Well here, let me show you out." And he walks you through the rest of the hallways. It's a beautiful, beautiful kind of domed center chamber into a long series of white stone hallways, similar material to what the first room you arrived in looked like. Eventually to a main foyer area, which has a very high ceiling and a series of beautifully carved pillars that show different creatures, almost like devas and demons battling each other as they spiral up these pillars, to the front doorways. There are two guards that are adorned in kinda silver and gold armor with these very high, elven in design-shaped helmets, and they step to the side as the doors open on their own.
Laura: Love the hat.
Matt: Guards do not respond to you whatsoever, they just step to the side. Gatekeeper says, "All right, well, here is your way out, have a wonderful evening and do please return for your report on the morrow."
Laura: Of course.
Sam: Oh, one more question before you leave, what district are we in right now?
Matt: "The Erudite Quarter."
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: Gesundheit.
Matt: "Good night." The doors slam (boof) behind you as you guys exit, and you're now--
Laura: Holy shit, we survived! What was that?
Marisha: Oh my god! Keyleth just goes down on her knees and starts kissing the ground.
Taliesin: Well, that could've gone worse.
Marisha: Oh, we're home.
Ashley: I just want to get in my bed so bad.
Marisha: Look! Stars!
Matt: You look up and, for the first time in close to a week, you can see stars, you can see a crescent moon, probably just past its single quarter phase. It is a sight for sore eyes right now.
Ashley: I'm so happy.
Travis: Would you say it's a beautiful sight?
Matt: Currently? The most beautiful night sky you've seen in all of your years.
Travis: I ruin it with a fart. (laughter)
Orion: I'm glad you held that the whole time we were down there, Grog.
Travis: I've had horrible stomach pains this whole time, I'm sorry.
Laura: What, are we just carrying around this stone Kima with us, or are we taking her back to our--
Liam: Yes, but don't stand right in front of her when you undo the stone.
Orion: Actually, hold on a minute, let's all rest before we deal with this one.
Travis: Yes.
Ashley: No, because I want to be able to have an extra 5th-level spell.
Travis: Oh, right.
Laura: But we're in town now, so we're safe.
Ashley: Yeah, let's go to the Keep.
Laura: Yeah, so it'll be fine.
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: It's a long way. We've got to go across the whole town to get there.
Laura: Well, we've got a fucking flying carpet.
Sam: We do have a flying carpet.
Taliesin: The metro's running at this hour.
Liam: We can probably flag down a wagon, too.
Laura: Yeah, we're in town!
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Fuck it. Everything's possible.
Taliesin: Let's go drinking.
Marisha: I was going to say, what bars are open?
Liam: We've got a lot of bling and a cursed Horn. The sky's the limit.
Ashley: I know, should we go to a tavern and get some ale?
Sam: What, who are you?
Travis: Really? You mean it?
Ashley: Well what do you mean, do I mean it?
Travis: It's all empty, can we fill it please?
Ashley: It's all empty?
Marisha: We should get some ale. Wait, maybe we should drop off the Bag of Holding so we're not carrying it around.
Travis: And the stone gnome.
Marisha: And then go out drinking.
Liam: We don't want to lose it in a game of cards.
Marisha: Yes, exactly. Exactly.
Travis: And stone Kima.
Sam: We'll be fine, we've never lost it before. There's eight of us, we'll be fine, let's go drinking.
Ashley: How far is the Keep from here?
Matt: I'd say it's probably a good hour walk.
Marisha: Oh, we've got time.
Taliesin: We could do a pub crawl, we'll just have a beer at every pub we hit on the way back to the Keep.
Marisha: Yes, let's do that! Pub crawl!
All: Pub crawl!
Marisha: We're going to pub crawl back to the Keep.
Liam: Starting here at Geek & Sundry.
Ashley: But should I go just in a bush just behind and--
Sam: Do you have to pee or something?
Ashley: No, and cast Greater Restoration on Kima?
All: No!
Sam: We want to enjoy this.
Orion: She doesn't have a sense of time, she won't know.
Sam: Or humor.
Travis: Let's put her in the bag. She's made of stone!
Laura: We won't tell her how much time has passed.
Taliesin: We'll un-stone her once we're back at the Keep.
Travis: She's stone. Stone doesn't breathe. Right?
Taliesin: It'll be fine.
Sam: We don't know.
Laura: Do not put her in the Bag of Holding! Do not. (laughter)
Liam: For the record, I think she'd be fine, too. But we could bring her around and introduce her; it could be like Weekend at Bernie's. (laughter)
Travis: Ah, yes! I put a fancy robe around Kima's stone statue.
Laura: This is so messed up.
Matt: All right, so as you guys begin making your celebratory pub crawl, starting with the Laughing Lamia Tavern, you buy drinks, laugh, chatter, and kind of take in the lively atmosphere that you would find at 3AM. Which is a little, at this point most of the fun folk are pretty drunk, but at this point you don't care, you'll take your own, and we'll take a quick five-minute break to use the bathroom and we'll pick up from there in just a moment, we'll see you guys here in five minutes to continue.
Travis: We lived!
Marisha: We lived!
Matt: Holy shit, guys.
Orion: I was fine. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time.
Matt: Welcome back. We got a little refresher here and apparently our Overlord has an announcement.
Zac: You guys, we're only four away from another giveaway, which is--
Lucas: Two away!
Zac: Two away, you know what, I'm guessing this is, we're going to get that before I even get back to my seat, so we're going to go do the giveaway. It's the shirt, the dice, the handbook, and the starter set. The handbook and the shirt will be signed by the cast.
Matt: Yep.
Zac: And we still have, if we get to 400, correct, next? Lucas?
Lucas: Yeah. 3,400.
Matt: 3,400.
Zac: If we get to 3,400 by the end of the night, we'll give away a whole other kit like this, with the signed stuff, so you get to subscribe and it supports the channel, keeps us running. I'm not going to interrupt these guys, so when we hit the number I'm just going to give it away through the chat room.
Matt: Awesome, guys. Well done and congrats to whoever ends up getting that, real fast I hope. So, thank you Overlord.
Taliesin: Oh wait, this is in here. Can I throw this? Oh no.
Matt: Pass it off, it's fine.
Taliesin: You get the horn.
Laura: Can I hold it for a second?
Travis: No.
Orion: No. Oh, I mean in real life. Yeah.
Marisha: No.
Orion: I was like, don't touch it.
Matt: So. Eventually you all manage to make your way towards the outer wall of Emon to the southern portion of the city. The guards let you through. Two of them recognize you from the Winter's Crest celebration that occurred about seven months beforehand. Don't do that, that's going to end poorly. You make your way around the bend to the large grass hill that is surrounded by the river that skirts the outer southern portion of Greyskull Keep. Looking up, you can see against the moonlight the very welcome sight of your home there, beckoning to you to rest. You make your way to the front gates that surround the outskirts of it, and an iron bell kind of goes off for a second, and as you look up, you hear a voice go, "Who goes there? Speak your mind, or a bolt to the throat you'll find."
Marisha: Shayne, is that Shayne?
Orion: Is it dark right now?
Matt: It's dark, yes.
Orion: I cast Light. "It's us!"
Matt: Okay, a light pierces off, and you guys look up and you can see, sitting on kind of the watchtower perch--
Marisha: Or wait, is that Jarett?
Matt: No, you see up there, short, rough red hair, Shayne Tranter, one of the mercenaries you hired--
Marisha: Oh, it is Shayne, I was right the first time!
Matt: She's got her crossbow ready to go, and she's just kind of sitting back and pointing it at the group, and she goes,
Liam: Hello! Hi!
Laura: Hope you remember us!
Marisha: Shayne!
Taliesin: We're drunk!
Sam: We pay you!
Matt: She laughs. Takes her crossbow, sets it to her side.
Ashley: We forgot our key!
Matt: "Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? It's been nearly a week since you left."
Laura: That's it?
Sam: Feels like a month.
Ashley: Feels like three months.
Taliesin: Feels like eleven weeks. It feels like a very long time.
Matt: "Well, it's probably closer to two weeks. Fair enough. Either way. Open the gates! Cordell, open the gates!"
Sam: Cordell? I don't remember the names of any of our guards.
Matt: Cordell, he's one of the other half-orc guards that you hired when you left.
Marisha: We have Shayne, Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick, and Nitebe.
Laura: Jarett was the one we appointed as the head guard, right? Captain?
Marisha: Jarett? I think so. I didn't write that part down.
Laura: I don't remember about the little fellow.
Sam: Our staff is so unappreciated, guys.
Matt: So as the gate slowly opens, Cordell walking out, this is the hearty half-orc merc dressed in scale armor, and he has a large sword slung on his back, just shoves it open to about a two-foot distance. "Come on. Welcome home." As each of you guys walk through, he kinda claps you on the back as you walk in. You make your way into the small courtyard leading to-- making your way into Greyskull Keep. Towards the front door, as you get there, the front door opens on its own as you're about ten feet away and peering from the inside of the low-lit interior you see a woman's face, a plump blond woman's face, peek through. This is Laina. Laina goes, "Oh, you're back, fantastic! It's early." And she rubs her face and you see as she pushes the door open a little more, she's wearing her nightgown, and she's excited but still very tired. "Come in, come in, come in, please, please! Who's that?" And points to the large stone statue you're dragging behind you.
Laura: Oh, we decided to get a statue for the garden.
Taliesin: Garden gnome.
Matt: "Very well, very well, come in."
Ashley: Hey! (laughter)
Travis: He's drunk.
Taliesin: I'm drunk!
Matt: So the human woman leads you all back in.
Laura: Put the gun down, Percy.
Ashley: Bad News.
Liam: It's not Cinco de Mayo.
Matt: She steps back with her knitted boots; she's definitely in comfortable mode. She eagerly hugs each of you as you enter, happy that you've all arrived, she's like, "I swear it's-- I've not had an employer leave so quickly after my hiring. But glad to see you're all safe. Shall I make everyone a meal, are you hungry?"
Marisha: Starving.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: "I'll get right to it." And she turns around, and you see further down the hallway Erwen Dastell, your older halfling servant who shuffles up with his nightcap on, it's long and dangling off his shoulders, he's got this long night robe on, he's kinda carrying a small candle. "My goodness. The hour is late of your arrival, but I can't say I am not excited to see you. Come in, your beds are ready, everything's been cleaned and made to your specifications. Laina! To food!" "I'm already on it, Erwen." She kinda smacks him on the back. He says, "Very well, then."
Sam: I love their banter.
Laura: Yeah, they're so cute.
Matt: "I will go back to bed, if that's fine with you."
Sam: Is there any urgent, oppressing news, any visitors that we should know about who came while we were gone, anything before you retire for the evening?
Matt: "No, I believe your friend, the mage woman with the blue robes came by once."
Sam: Allara?
Matt: "Allura. She came by a couple days ago, just to see if you had returned. But I didn't know where you were, and she said she'd try again later."
Sam: Any packages, mail, post?
Matt: "None that I know of, no. In fact it's been very quiet."
Sam: All right, thank you.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Quiet is good.
Matt: "Back to my quarters." And he shuffles off, goes towards his bed. You guys make your way into the main dining chamber of your Keep, four large round tables set out with the chairs around it. You can see, for the most part, it's been untouched other than a couple of chairs that are set ajar, probably by your mercenary soldiers who've been eating and/or have been keeping up. There's a couple of empty tables set on the side that immediately Laina goes, "I'm so sorry, I guess I should've taken care of this." And she stumbles off towards the kitchen and you guys all eventually find yourselves sitting, sore, exhausted, mildly intoxicated, around these chairs and take a very deep-breathing sigh of relief at being back home here in Emon in Greyskull Keep.
Sam: Should we un-stone Kima, or should we sleep on it?
Orion: I stand up and I head towards the sleeping quarters and I just say, "Leave her to stone tonight, we'll deal with it tomorrow." And I go to bed.
Sam: I turn him into a rat.
Liam: Dispel Magic.
Matt: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw, Tiberius.
Orion: Hold on a sec. I can still cast as an animal, right?
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Nope, you cannot talk.
Orion: Oh. I still go to bed. (laughter)
Orion: So yeah.
Travis: Hoo baby.
Laura: That's adorable.
Matt: You go under your covers, go to sleep, nuzzle in.
Orion: In between my pillow.
Marisha: It's quite comfy sleeping like an animal.
Ashley: He's a little rat and he still went in his big bed.
Liam: I pick up the sleeping rat and just kinda scritch him.
Laura: He's in bed.
Liam: It's all right, he's fine. Look, see, his leg's going, he's dreaming about something nice.
Travis: We ate already, right?
Matt: You snacked a bit as you made it through the town, but for the most part like, a meal's being prepared. You begin to smell now the cooking of meat, Laina's setting it up for you guys.
Liam: You're dreaming of magical artifacts, aren't you?
Laura: Quick question, friends  So we kind of started a war, am I right?
Liam: Yeah. Pretty sure we did.
Laura: Kraghammer is potentially in grave danger, am I right?
Marisha: We might want to let them know.
Laura: We should probably let them know as soon as possible.
Liam: First of all, Clarota was lying through his noodles, and second, even if he wasn't, which he was, he's now fucking pissed off--
Laura: He's dead.
Liam: Well, they're all one hive-mind, right? Listen. This is number five tonight.
Taliesin: They weren't particularly connected until the very end, he was dead before they were actually connected.
Liam: They're angry. They were following us.
Taliesin: They may not know who we are.
Marisha: That's interesting.
Liam: You don't think they're going to scurry up the bottom of Kraghammer and tear that place apart?
Taliesin: We'll let them know, but we may have time, we hurt them very badly.
Liam: It took us about a week to get from Kraghammer in, so we've got about a week.
Marisha: Well, why don't we do some research, I mean, this was the first time.
Sam: Yeah, we'd have to stop them on the way out the hole, right? There's only one way in and out.
Ashley: Don't the dwarves already know that they were there, and they were already prepping for battle?
Sam: They don't really know what's coming for them.
Liam: They don't know anything about mind flayers, they know about weird things coming out, but not the mind flayers.
Travis: So let's send a pigeon or something.
Taliesin: The mind flayers have been down there for ages. There's nothing new.
Laura: You don't think they'll come up and attack?
Marisha: To be fair, we also did sort of release the mind flayers from their evil dictator.
Liam: Yeah, they seemed very grateful.
Sam: We could stop them on their way out.
Taliesin: I think this will also be a conversation that Lady Kima will have some--
Marisha: Okay, well, the thing we then need to immediately decide, before we un-stone Lady Kima, is what're we going to do with the Horn?
Taliesin: I think if we have Allura here, and begin that conversation, then we can have Allura's insight.
Marisha: Before we un-stone Lady Kima?
Taliesin: Yes. I think we tell Allura before we un-stone Lady Kima. Everything that's happened--
Liam: The only person, the only person that would remotely know is you, Tiberius, and I don't think--
Sam: He's a rat.
Liam: Oh, that's a good boy.
Travis: And he's asleep.
Liam: He didn't seem to know anything, I think Allura is the person to go to right now.
Laura: Well, you need to share it with us.
Ashley: Wake up from bed!
Travis: He's sleeping.
Taliesin: No, let's wait until Allura's here, I think, and we can--
Travis: Do we tell her, do we tell her we have the Horn? Or do we not?
Liam: Yes, yes, we do.
Marisha: Why don't we just wake up Tiberius?
Laura: Tiberius. Little darling!
Sam: I'm still punishing him.
Liam: I'm still cuddling him.
Orion: Did they wake me up?
Liam: No! I'm holding you.
Orion: Okay.
Liam: I don't want to wake you up.
Matt: You start to wake up, and then he scritches the side of your cheek and you go right back to sleep.
Laura: Damn it, he's so cute. I don't know what to do.
Matt: Laina comes out with plates for you guys and sets up these--
Travis: Thank. God.
Matt: They're not pretty, but functional meals of cooked pork, some fine mashed potatoes.
Travis: I would like to eat.
Matt: And you do ravenously, and this is the first warm meal you've really truly had in five, six days.
Travis: I take Lady Kima's portions and I--
Matt: There were no portions made for your garden structure.
Travis: Never know.
Matt: That's okay, there's plenty more.
Sam: So talk to Allura first, then unfreeze Lady Kima?
Liam: She sent us after Kima. Kima thinks that she's in the middle of a fight, the moment she comes out she'll be all hot and bothered--
Marisha: Okay, hang on, hang on. That's true, she did send us after Kima, so what if they're both on the side that we don't--
Travis: Yeah, Allura's going to unfreeze Kima.
Taliesin: We're going to have to trust somebody.
Travis: Why don't we just hold onto the Horn for a second and see what they do without it.
Laura: Why don't we tell them we didn't find it? Why don't we just hide the Horn?
Travis: We just hold onto it in the bag.
Marisha: Don't we have a safe? Didn't we build a safe in our Keep?
Matt: You did not have a safe built, but you could possibly have that done.
Ashley: Wait, so why are you guys so against giving the Horn to Kima?
Marisha: I just feel like if it's so terrible, why does she want it for herself?
Laura: She doesn't, she wants to hide it.
Ashley: Does she want to destroy it?
Laura: Maybe she wants to destroy it, maybe she wanted to get it up above ground so she could destroy it.
Sam: There's a second Horn, maybe she has the other one and wants the matching set.
Taliesin: Do we know that there's a second horn?
Laura: She's a paladin, she's good, paladins are good by--
Sam: I'm fine trusting her. I was fine trusting Clarota.
Travis: Do you want to wake up, do you have something important to say?
Marisha: Right, because no one of the church has ever been bad before.
Liam: We didn't trust Clarota. We were using him as much as he was using us.
Laura: Some of us truly trusted Clarota.
Liam: It went south. Well, most of us.
Travis: All right, fuck it, I walk over and I take the rat out of Vax's hands and I shake it awake.
Sam: He's still a rat!
Travis: I shake it a lot.
Marisha: I undo his Polymorph, I undo his Polymorph.
Sam: With what?
Matt: With what?
Marisha: By Polymorph.
Matt: You re-Polymorph him?
Marisha: Can I release Polymorph by using Polymorph?
Matt: No. It's his incantation.
Travis: I spit on Tiberius's head and rub it in vigorously.
Marisha: Scanlan, come on. We need to talk to him.
Orion: I'm trying to bite Grog. I am not happy.
Matt: It's like this viscous Grog spit mixed with chunks of pork and mashed potato rubbed in your fur.
Marisha: Scanlan, he's nipping! Scanlan. Tiberius is nipping. Please.
Sam: All right, fine. He's a human thing again.
Liam: He's not human at all.
Sam: A dragonborn.
Orion: Why did you wake me up? I was so comfy being furry! (laughter)
Orion: I always have scales. It was nice having fur!
Marisha: I told you. It's nice being cuddly.
Orion: I was so soft.
Laura: Tiberius, we're sorry to wake you.
Taliesin: Tiberius, we're having a lovely breakfast. Tell us a story.
Orion: Have I rested? What's going on?
Matt: No, it's been ten minutes.
Orion: What the fuck? (laughter)
Travis: Vex has a question for you.
Marisha: We're all still drunk and awake. We don't want to go to bed yet! Just, just talk with us.
Laura: I just want to hear your lovely little explanation, darling, about what the Horn is and why you don't trust Kima.
Orion: Oh!
Taliesin: Tell us a story.
Marisha: Tell us a story!
Laura: Please. You haven't told any of us anything.
Marisha: We haven't talked to you in a week.
Orion: The Horn of Orcus.
Matt: Horn of Orcus.
Orion: This thing comes from a devil, a demon. Nothing good could ever come from anything it made in existence. It needs to be destroyed. And I'm sorry. Let me articulate these words a little bit more. There is nothing that you can use this particular artifact for any reason of good. The fact that it is even here is a very bad sign because it was taken from one of these beasts.
Ashley: So why don't we destroy it?
Orion: That's exactly what we need to do.
Travis: Isn't that what Kima wanted?
Laura: What if they want to destroy it?
Orion: I don't think they wanted to bring it back.
Laura: Question. Why?
Orion: Because there is-- the liquid hot magma that was below where it was being held was very sufficient for it to be thrown in.
Marisha: That's true. See, I'm with him.
Laura: Wait, but your crushing fist couldn't destroy it, so maybe lava can't destroy it, so maybe it needs something extra special that only they know about.
Travis: It needs the Sword of Gryffindor.
Orion: No. Pike could destroy it.
Ashley: Ex-squeeze me? I don't think that's true.
Orion: Give yourself a little bit more credit. You killed a dragon.
Laura: You did kill a dragon.
Travis: You did kill a dragon.
Ashley: I did kill a dragon. Huzzah.
Marisha: And you died. And come back to life. By the way, we haven't talked about that. What was it like on the other side?
Travis: Let's stay on topic here.
Marisha: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little tipsy.
Liam: Vax shoves another flagon in front of Keyleth.
Ashley: I don't think I can destroy it.
Taliesin: From what I understand-- is it possible that it's not possible to destroy this and instead it has to be banished somewhere, perhaps?
Orion: No. If it could be a permanent banishment, yes. But we don't know what kind of plane and what creatures lie there that would, perhaps, come upon that artifact. What are the elements? Fire burns earth.
Laura: Wind blows.
Orion: Light destroys darkness. Pike, you're the only one who--
Sam: Rock beats scissors.
Orion: Exactly, Scanlan. You're the only one who could-- if your weapon had any kind of light enchantment on them, could probably smash this thing to bits. Then we would have to scatter the remnants, the pieces, far from each other, if not find different ways to destroy those pieces.
Laura: Why don't you trust them?
Orion: Because it comes from something that would--
Laura: Not the Horn. Why don't you trust Kima?
Orion: Because they wanted to bring it somewhere where they-- I don't know. Which is why I wanted you to do the half thing, where we could question Kima without her attacking us or trying to attempt to take the Horn from us.
Marisha: Well, here's my thing. Even if she has good intentions. Say she has good intentions and maybe they just wanted to bring the horn back to study it. And no one should be messing with this whatsoever.
Laura: I think they want to destroy it.
Taliesin: I'm of the opinion they probably want to banish it somewhere.
Travis: Yeah, I think they do.
Marisha: Then why don't we just agree to not hand it over.
Taliesin: No, this is good. This means that there's no reason, necessarily, not to trust them. We just know that we don't trust the Horn, and that's a perfectly reasonable way to come at it.
Liam: In the short term, Scanlan, are you able to send it to another dimension for a while?
Laura: No, I don't trust it anywhere out of our sight.
Sam: I cannot. It is not alive. I cannot.
Travis: Put it in the bag.
Laura: It's in the bag.
Taliesin: It's perfectly safe in the bag.
Travis: How about we rest, we put the Horn in the bag, we wake up Kima, we go, "Oh, we brought you back, sorry we don't have the Horn. If we did, what would you do with it?" And then we decide what we do.
Taliesin: I like half that plan.
Marisha: I kind of like that plan.
Orion: I like that plan, too.
Laura: I think we should tell her we didn't get it and see what she does.
Orion: Allura is somebody who should not be here when this conversation happens, because if they turn south, she's a more powerful sorcerer than I.
Marisha: We need to decide, do we tell her that we destroyed it, or do we tell her that we just didn't get it and that it's still down there.
Travis: We can't say destroyed because we don't know how we did that, right?
Laura: No, we didn't destroy it. We say, "Oh no, they, we got overrun and we had to leave."
Taliesin: But then they're going to tell us to go back for it.
Travis: That's fine, but if we ask like what she would've done if we had it, and when she leaves we go, "Hah, we have it."
Laura: Or we go, "Oh, well good, then actually we do have it, you can do that."
Travis: Yeah, if she wants to study it or use it or transform it into something, we don't give it to her, we try to destroy it ourselves. If she wants to banish it and do something that Tiberius is happy with, then we go like, "Hey, we have it."
Liam: When we meet her I don't think we should have it, I think one or two of us should take it away. We don't all have to be at that meeting.
Taliesin: I think we just keep it in the Bag of Holding, she'll never suspect.
Marisha: Well, hang on, it's in the Bag of Holding right now?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes.
Orion: Grog, is there nothing else in that bag of holding?
Travis: Nothing it can, we took out all the stuff it can turn into some like evil transformer or something.
Liam: You know, the other characters can make insight checks too, you know that, right?
Matt: There's a pile somewhere with armor.
Travis: Everything has out with parentheses next to it.
Liam: If we have it, then she's, she could say you're lying--
Laura: Or she might not be able to tell because we're so good at lying. (laughter)
Liam: I don't think your winks will work on her.
Sam: Legitimately, no one can tell when I'm lying.
Marisha: I mean, we could Stone Shape it and I could like Stone Shape it and bury it somewhere in our Keep.
Travis: One person should leave with it. I'll leave with it.
Liam: Yes, it's fucking simple.
Taliesin: That's genius.
Travis: Yeah, I'll leave. It's not like I'm going to talk to the sorcerers.
Liam: You and I could take a walk with it and play tiddlywinks or something in the woods. That's fine, what's wrong with that, it's easy.
Taliesin: That's a very good plan.
Orion: Do you want it very far away?
Travis: Yeah, you're a talker, I'm not.
Taliesin: No, we don't.
Marisha: Wait. You're talking about just taking a stroll through the forest with the Horn of Orcus?
Travis: No, I'll just hang out outside.
Orion: In the Keep, how about just stay in the Keep?
Liam: Just be somewhere else. Anywhere else.
Ashley: You could hang out in the temple downstairs.
Laura: I fall asleep on the table.
Travis: Shall we sleep?
Sam: Let's sleep and meet with Kima in the morning.
Taliesin: This was a fabulous breakfast, good night.
Liam: Vax gives his sleeping sister a wet willie.
Laura: Ugh!
Travis: I put my head right in my food and fall asleep.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's not forget, you've still got a funny toe.
Sam: I check my bed to make sure no one shat in it. (laughter)
Orion: I did leave a little rat turd before I got scooped out. Just so you know.
Laura: Trinket, let's go to bed.
Marisha: I turn, I go Minxie and I curl up by the fire.
Travis: Yeah, Minxie!
Liam: Scanlan! Turn Tiberius back into a rat.
Orion: Oh yes, I'm going to bed.
Liam: Back into a rat.
Marisha: You can curl up with me.
Sam: Would you like to be a rat?
Orion: I like being furry.
Sam: Well then, no. I'm still punishing you. (laughter)
Orion: That's fine. Have your fun tonight, people, you will have your licking in the morning. I go to sleep.
Matt: All right. You guys all go to rest for the evening, the best rest you've had in a long time, your beds are comfortable, well set, it's a warm interior.
Ashley: I'm starfished on my bed.
Matt: This is the first time in a while that Pike, you've been able to sleep without your armor on, and it's so nice.
Laura: That's great.
Matt: You sleep hard, you sleep for an extended period, eventually you all begin to rouse, as you all wake up, the smell of fresh breakfast food is already coming to--
Laura: That and Pike's stank from her armor.
Matt: Yeah, you're going to have to wash that armor, girl.
Travis: It's like when you take a cast off, you're like, ugh.
Matt: It's bad.
Marisha: Actually, is there a bath house in the village?
Matt: You haven't inquired. You could ask around if you want.
Marisha: We should have a girls' day at the bath house.
Orion: I woke up and took a dirt bath.
Liam: You're not a rat, though.
Matt: Yeah. Oh, but he didn't transform you, though.
Orion: Huh?
Matt: He didn't transform you.
Orion: I know, in lizard form.
Sam: Gross.
Orion: In my form.
Taliesin: That's awesome.
Orion: Scales, you rub it off with clay?
Matt: Yeah, there you go. Out in the front of the Keep.
Laura: Gross!
Orion: I have a little dirt in my room.
Laura: A little pile of grossness.
Liam: We just don't fear for our lives for the first time.
Sam: Let's go down and have our meeting.
Matt: So you guys head down into the dining room again, Kima's still standing there with the maul, left where she was. Grog is still face-down like on the table, grabbed the plate up against his face with mashed potatoes across his cheek. Across the way at the far table, you see Cordell and Shayne are both finishing their breakfast, and are sitting there at the table with their arms kind of gathering as you enter. "Morning!" "Morning." And they both kind of finish their meal. Get up and stand up. "Enjoy your breakfast. You've earned it." "I think our shift is done." She pats Cordell and they both get up and they exit out.
Laura: Have a good night! I know, I know, but they're sleeping.
Travis: I start awake with food on my face and I wipe it off and eat it. "I had a horrible dream about two walking testicles that were hurting my mind."
Sam: That was no dream! (laughter)
Liam: I am so sad that you woke up. I was just about to go to the hearth and get some ash and draw a penis on your head.
Travis: I had a feeling something was coming.
Liam: Next thing out of my mouth, that's a promise.
Ashley: Where's the Bag of Holding?
Travis: I've got it.
Ashley: Can you check in your bag to see if the Horn is still there?
Laura: And it's okay?
Travis: I look in the bag of holding and I see a Horn?
Matt: You look in the bag and you see nothing. You imagine something, you reach in, you pull it out.
Taliesin: Don't do that.
Laura: How are we going to get it out of there?
Orion: I can.
Ashley: Can you tell if it's in there?
Sam: Can you teleport something out of a bag?
Orion: It's Telekinesis, I can picture it and--
Laura: Teleport it, can you pull it out and make sure it's still there and okay?
Matt: Okay. So you use Telekinesis, you lift the Horn out--
Orion: No, I don't do it. I'm assuming it's there. I'm not doing that right now.
Laura: Wait, no, check though, I want to make sure it's okay.
Orion: I'm pretty sure it's there.
Laura: But I want to make sure.
Sam: All right, I will check with Mage Hand or whatever, I got something else. Mage Hand, yeah, I'll Mage Hand it.
Matt: Mage Hand gently and slowly lifts it out, you can see the Horn kinda holds there for a second, it moves very slowly.
Travis: Yeah, put it back in.
Matt: Put it back in the bag.
Travis: Thank you, tie it up tight. I'm going to go down to the, what is it, the temple below the thingie?
Ashley: Okay, yeah, go down to the temple.
Travis: All right, I'm going to go play in the dark with myself. That sounded wrong.
Matt: Okay, so you head down into the temple to Sarenrae, which is beautiful, it's all like a giant two-story stained glass three-set walls with trees and hedges set up and flowers, bunch of wooden kind of long benches set up towards this, the altar in the center, it's beautiful, especially this time of day, it's close to noon right now so the sun's streaking through the top of it, and it's cascading through the tree boughs of the two trees that are closest to the entrance. It's a beautiful sight. Even you, Grog, are moved.
Travis: Just because I'm nervous, I reach into the Bag of Holding and pull out a vial of holy oil that I have. I have three vials of holy oil and I just hold it in one hand while I'm down there.
Matt: All right. So while he's down there, the rest of you guys, what're you doing?
Orion: I'm going to cast Circle of Teleportation in my room.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: No, I'm going to go to the treasury first, I'm going to take out 500 gold pieces, and then I'm going to go to my room and cast Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius is gone.
Sam: Let's heal Kima.
Laura: You just left us?
Orion: By the blessing of Bahamut, I choose Draconia.
Matt: Tiberius is gone.
Ashley: Okay, so, I'm going to stand behind Kima and--
Taliesin: We're going to face her towards the wall.
Ashley: Face her towards the wall.
Liam: Good idea.
Ashley: Or towards something happy.
Taliesin: We're ready to pull you away when she starts to move.
Ashley: Yeah, okay. So.
Marisha: Wait! Are we unfreezing her?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: No, I thought we were going to talk to Allura first.
Laura: No, we're going to talk to her first.
Marisha: Oh wait, that's right. And we were going to do that thing.
Laura: You were drunk, it's okay.
Marisha: That's right, I was probably tipsy, sorry. We came up with like eight plans last night.
Laura: You were so drunk.
Sam: Wait, shouldn't Grog be here, he's the one who likes her.
Travis: Oh, the things I sacrifice for the group.
Ashley: So I cast Greater Restoration on Kima.
Laura: And then run away!
Matt: Okay, you reach out and touch the back of Kima. Her stone armor turns to gold and rapidly her entire form goes back to flesh. As she finishes her swing with the maul (impact sound) against the stone wall. And she kinda steps back for a second, confused, and looks over her shoulder at the rest of you.
Sam: Everything's okay, everything's okay, we're out of danger, we're at home, it's okay.
Laura: It's fine, it's fine, guess what, we are alive.
Sam: We lived.
Matt: Just drops the maul for a second and kinda leans back against the wall.
Marisha: I just get the leftover mashed potatoes from breakfast.
Matt: "Thank you, thank you, oh thank you. What happened?" She's not even using utensils, she's just like scooping it with her hand at this point.
Laura: So we killed K'Varn, right?
Matt: "Obviously."
Sam: Funny story, you were right about Clarota. He was horrible, we killed him. We killed him! Hey, you were right.
Laura: But not before we were overrun with a bunch of evil brothers of his.
Taliesin: And we got a very fancy hat out of it.
Laura: Hey, right, look at his hat.
Sam: We should've known all along, you were right, we should've trusted you, sorry.
Matt: "It's all right. He had his uses, certainly."
Liam: You were right, we were wrong, you're very attractive, we're all quite ugly.
Matt: "That isn't necessary, but the compliment is appreciated, regardless. Thank you for bringing me back with you. You could have easily left me back and I appreciate that you took the time."
Sam: So, you're alive, that's good because you were sorta on a suicide mission.
Matt: "Not a suicide mission."
Laura: What exactly was your mission, Kima?
Matt: "Where's the Horn?"
Laura: Well, thing is, it's not here.
Matt: "All right. It's not with the illithid, is it?"
Sam: It's in a safe place.
Matt: "How safe?"
Laura: Pretty safe.
Taliesin: Why, what can it do?
Matt: She looks visually nervous and she goes--
Laura: Nothing can touch it.
Matt: "Well, that's what the Order that originally sealed it believes. Even if it's somewhere safe temporarily, we can possibly relocate it. But we have to-- (sighs)"
Liam: You saw your mission as a suicide mission, but if you had secured it, what were your plans? What was plan B? What were you going to do?
Matt: "Well, if I were to fall in the process of trying to get the Horn, others would come after me. I sent word to my Order that if I did not return they would send more."
Laura: Can I insight?
Matt: Go for it, yeah, go ahead and roll insight.
Laura: 19.
Sam: Ooh!
Marisha: Whisper time! Sweet, sweet whispers.
Sam: Keep subscribing, guys, because whispering action doesn't come free.
Marisha: How many subscribers away are we?
Lucas: 38.
Marisha: 38 subscribers.
Travis: That's a lot.
Marisha: That's a lot.
Sam: That's a lot.
Marisha: That is still a lot.
Sam: Keep subscribing to Geek and Sundry, where you can watch Matt Mercer whisper at people.
Matt: And she goes, "So this Horn, which is one of two, if Allura is correct, was sealed a thousand or so years ago by those who originally cut it from the head of the avatar of Orcus of which it was bestowed. They, once he was slain, did everything they could within their power to destroy it, yet this artifact, instilled with the purity of Orcus, was indestructible to their knowledge. So the least they could do was to seal both horns across the world from each other and forget that it even existed. Which worked well until recently. It wasn't until these visions came to me and other members of my Order that we knew that this, this was a thing, and me being the closest in my pilgrimage, we took that as time of the essence I was to go in there with a team and retrieve it. If it couldn't be destroyed, at the very least we could convene and decide a safer place to possibly reseal it and forget. There are magical ways of forcing those of us who know how to forget. That would be the safest thing for it. If there is a way to destroy it, we don't know, but that could also be sought after. We have arcane and divine knowledge we didn't have back then, so, in the long run it needs to be retrieved, the longer it stays down there in the Underdark, no matter where you placed it, it draws like a beacon all darkness to it until something else like this beholder K'Varn will take up the mantle and themselves be as dangerous or more so than he ever was."
Laura: So the other Horn is still safe?
Matt: "As far as I know. The visions only gave me access to where this one was. I can only assume that it's out there, but if someone else were to find it, I would know that they probably have knowledge of the second one existing, as well. I don't know if K'Varn shared this information, but if someone else takes the mantle of this Horn, what's to stop them from seeking the other?"
Liam: Bummer.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "Regardless, I appreciate that we're all alive and we're together, and where are we?"
Laura: Oh, you're in our home.
Sam: Greyskull Keep. It's in Emon.
Matt: "We're in Emon?"
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "Well, that's wondrous, we can speak with Allura. She would have the wisdom to know what to do with this next."
Sam: Hypothetical. What if an army of darkness was slowly approaching Emon to kill all of us?
Matt: "What are you saying?"
Sam: Well, we killed Clarota and K'Varn, but we, there was a lot of bad guys down there that we could not kill--
Laura: We hurt that Elder Brain real bad, but not bad enough.
Matt: "I don't know much about the illithid themselves, but they reside deep and they are not fans of the surface. I believe that it was K'Varn's initial onset that was pushing them, both in union with the duergar and pushing them towards the siege. They spoke of something about bringing twilight to the surface world. I don't know what that was about, but I fear what knowledge they have if left alone. At the very least, I know that they're probably having to return and lick their wounds where we left behind. It would be folly for them, especially knowing that we're aware, to attack now."
Laura: Okay, that's good.
Matt: "But we can notify those in Kraghammer to buffer their defenses, close the tunnels that you took down there and my army as well, and that should give us time to prepare if we choose to seize or at least seal them off."
Laura: And your Order is what?
Matt: "The Order of the Platinum Dragon."
Laura: Right. That's a really good Order, right?
Taliesin: History check, can I do a history check?
Matt: It's a religion check.
Taliesin: That's a religion check, not history check?
Marisha: Pike.
Matt: You could roll a history check and probably gain some knowledge based on that, but the--
Ashley: Could I do it?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Ashley: Are you doing a religion check, Percy?
Taliesin: I'm doing a history check, if you want to do a religion check.
Ashley: I'll do a religion check.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: 22.
Ashley: So fucking close.
Matt: I mean, you guys are familiar loosely with the name Bahamut, you've heard Tiberius bring it up before, you've seen temples to it, but your knowledge knows that Bahamut is very well regarded as the lawful good deity of justice and honor and is primarily one of the great good gods of this pantheon.
Taliesin: If we're going to trust anyone, I think this is a good--
Travis: Yeah, I feel pretty good about this.
Taliesin: I trust the organization, they have a sterling reputation.
Marisha: So, Kima. Pie-in-the-sky goal? You would destroy the Horn?
Matt: "If we had the means of doing so, yes. We'd have to talk to the Order, we'd have to talk to the Council, we'd have to bring people that we could trust and that had the capabilities of knowing if this were possible how we would go about it. It's beyond my knowledge."
Liam: I think what worries us is anyone coming in contact with it would be corrupted.
Matt: "Don't go into contact with it."
Laura: No.
Liam: No, of course.
Marisha: Just within range.
Sam: Yes, is proximity okay?
Matt: "I don't know, I saw it for as long as you did."
Laura: This could be bad.
Sam: Evil Grog?
Laura: Kind of uncomfortable.
Matt: "The essence of most artifacts like this, it goes more than just touch, one has to be imbued, bond with these artifacts, to attune with them like any powerful magical item to truly gain its power, but that's not to say that itself does not contain some sort of foul intelligence."
Ashley: Can I go downstairs and go get Grog?
Matt: Okay. So you walk your way down.
Travis: (sings) I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
Matt: As you're walking past, as you walk past you are immediately met in the hallway by Erwen, your servant, your halfling elder servant who walks up and says, "Dear, I wanted to let you know that a scroll came for you, some sort of a summons." And he hands it to you.
Ashley: Me?
Sam: Probably jury duty.
Matt: And he kinda walks past you in the tunnel.
Taliesin: Always the worst time.
Matt: You open it up a little bit, it's not, hasn't been opened, you kinda pull the paper and open it up. It's a summon to the Council of Tal'Dorei, it's written by the hand of the clerk, and it says, essentially, the sovereign Uriel has been notified of your arrival and would like to see you at the council chambers posthaste.
Ashley: Okay. I'm still going to go get Grog, but I'll pass the scroll around. Hey Grog, come upstairs.
Travis: Oh yeah?
Marisha: That was for all of us?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: It was addressed to Vox Machina.
Travis: Is it clear?
Ashley: Just don't say anything yet, but just come upstairs.
Travis: Did she ask about me?
Laura: She definitely did.
Ashley: She did, yeah.
Travis: With my bald head.
Matt: All right. You make your way back in, Kima finishes her meal, and you guys are chatting a bit, she's just like, "All right, if I may ask, how did you seal it? I feel uncomfortable knowing the process and that it's at least safe."
Marisha: Oh, we have one of the best defense mechanisms. Grog!
Travis: Hello, Lady Kima.
Laura: It's in a very secure magical item.
Matt: She glances at you and goes, "All right, very well. Just be mindful that you don't go reaching in there."
Marisha: I use my Druidcraft as he enters to make little sparkles and lightning bugs appear around him. "Grog!"
Matt: Lady Kima, who is currently covered in dirt and sweat, still in the golden armor that she wrestled from the long-dead corpse of a dwarf in the Underdark, her chin is smattered with dried mashed potatoes and a bit of her breakfast, kinda gives--
Laura: So she's covered in food as well.
Matt: (laughs) Gives you a look as you're walking in like. "It's good to see you alive, friend."
Travis: Yeah, more than alive, I think.
Ashley: And also, he actually pulled you out of the cavern with one arm while you were stone. Out of the whole place.
Travis: Oh, stop, I don't like to brag.
Matt: She stands up and kinda wipes the food off her chin, clutches her symbol, and then steps right before you, looking up towards your face and says, "I thank you, friend Grog."
Laura: Friendzoned!
Matt: And then reaches out and gives you a big hug.
Liam: Plus he decided not to put you in the magical bag when you were a statue.
Matt: She releases Grog slightly, and kinda gives you a keen look and goes, "Also appreciated."
Travis: Yeah, well, you know.
Laura: Oh my god, thank god.
Sam: Why don't you go rest? We'll summon Allura and we'll continue the conversation from there, I guess.
Matt: "Please, I'd love to see her, it's been too long. All right, I'm going to, is there a room I could rest?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: You could use my room.
Taliesin: There's a guest room.
Laura: Yes, we have a guest room.
Sam: We should use it.
Orion: I would've had your back, by the way, there.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: Erwen, who's by the door, leads her to the guest room and you guys take a moment to rest. We'll go ahead and pick up next session at that point, where Allura's being brought in, so we'll stop the game there as I have to rush to the airport, but before that we have some gifts to open from you guys.
Travis: You're rushing to the airport tonight?
Matt: Huh?
Travis: You're rushing to the airport tonight?
Matt: Yeah, I got a redeye, 1AM. To be in Sandusky, Ohio. At Collisi--er no, Collosalcon. Please come.
Travis: You're going to do the waterslides, right? You won't ride waterslides?
Matt: It'll be fun. Guys, thank you so much for watching, that was a lot of fun.
Sam: We lived!
Matt: And everyone lived! Barely.
Marisha: We lived!
Matt: Barely, oh my god.
Marisha: Holy shit, we lived.
Travis: One roll away from her being--
Ashley: That was rough.
Matt: Her and Scanlan.
Laura: One point, twice.
Matt: Twice for you.
Travis: Twice.
Taliesin: I'm going to go get our d20s back.
Marisha: Crazyballs. Oh yeah. We had two sparkles and a green one.
Ashley: I was just rolling bad.
Zac: Hey, guys. We got some gifts for you from the chatroom. Some letters.
Liam: I got an Asus computer with an "aren't we clever" sticker on it?
Marisha: Sweet.
Zac: Man, I'll give you an "aren't we clever" sticker if you want, it's worth about the same. We also have some donations to read off. (cheering)
Zac: So guys, as long as we're live, that subscriber giveaway still stands.
Laura: How far away are we from it?
Zac: 36 subs away from another giveaway. All right.
Matt: All right.
Zac: If you want to go ahead and, actually I don't know if she wanted this to be read. Oh, okay, but this is cool. Do you want to hand me those disposable cameras? Where did he go? Oh, I lost him.
Matt: Essentially it says, "Vox Machina, I have sent you a disposable camera. Basically I had this idea to send this to you and have you guys go crazy, fill up the camera with random shenanigans, whether it's behind-the-scenes, setup during a stream, or elsewise of your shoes, and then once you guys have filled both cameras, you can send them back with the already printed label included in the box I sent this in, send it back to me, I can get the pictures printed and doubled and then send you guys a set back once they're developed."
Marisha: Aw, that's a good idea!
Matt: "I thought it'd be something different for you guys to do, hopefully you enjoy it and I can't wait to hear back from you. Becca."
Marisha: That's fun!
Matt: Thank you so much, Becca.
Marisha: Awesome.
Ashley: Thank you, Becca.
Matt: Yeah, we'll keep the rest to ourselves. We've got an awesome picture of Grog and Mustang Scanlan. Look at that.
Taliesin: (sings) Mustang Scanlan.
Travis: Horse head. Evil horse head of doom.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: (sing) Slow your mustang down.
Marisha: (sing) Slow your mustang down.
Matt: All right, here we go.
Zac: All right, so let's get through these messages here.
Matt: All right, let's get this going, because I've got to get running soon.
Laura: All right.
Matt: All right, we have Jasonofarabia, heart, "Got up at 5am to watch you guys live, great show." That's awesome, donated $100.

Zac: Oh, Minecraft server.
Matt: Minecraft server surprise for you. "Come to these coordinates--" We have the coordinates here. "--and you will find your temple."
Zac: Somebody should probably write this down.
Matt: "1350 by 1350 z."
Zac: 1350 x.
Matt: "1350 x by 1350 z and you will find your temple of Sarenrae."
Ashley: Wait, 1350 z by 1350 x?
Zac: 1350 x by--

Marisha: That's where all of our crits were going.
Matt: "By the way, Matt, when I get my copy of Arkham Knight, is it possible to get it sent somewhere for an autograph?" Send it to this studio with return post, we're happy to do that. That's fine. As long as it's sent with return postage already paid, I'll be happy to sit here one of these days.
Laura: That's an important thing, return postage.

Zac: I'm going to have to remember that move.
Matt: Yeah, you should. All right. Rona Konandario. "A friend showed me Critical Role a few weeks ago, just as our long-time group of friends started our game. It must've been destiny.

All: What?
Marisha: What is that?
Orion: Oh, the dagger, dude! It's a dagger!
Laura: This is for me?
Matt: That is for you.
Laura: Holy crap!
Sam: Wait, Laura, what did you get?
Matt: Oh my god, you got Jonathan Frakes signed?
Sam: Is he a fan of the show?
Matt: I'm sorry, Laura, what's this you have signed over here?
Laura: Oh my gosh. You'll always be my Number One.
Zac: This is for you to give to--
Laura: This is from Team Wishlist. Thank you so much!
Liam: This is a magic carpet for the group.

Matt: That's amazing.
Taliesin: That is so badass.
Matt: I'm going to say that's the keen dagger.
Laura: Look at how many daggers he has now! Ludicrous.
Liam: Just ten more.
Marisha: So many daggers.
Matt: All righty, guys, so. As a heads-up. "Attn Geek and Sundry Twitch. To the awesome people at Geek and Sundry, please forward this package to the members of Critical Role on my behalf. I have made them each a personalized pendant with their character names, plus a few extras. Earrings inspired by Keyleth, Pike, and Vex'ahlia for Marisha, Ashley, and Laura, and four Vox Machina pendants which can be kept or given away. Many thanks to all involved for making Critical Role possible. Those short videos of their campaign on Vine were never enough to know what was going on. Sincerely yours, Ipec Psy." That's so awesome. Thank you so much, Ipec. Okay, pass this down to Percy?
Orion: I got this amazing Tiberius pin.
Laura: So cute!
Taliesin: So fantastic.
Zac: Tiberius.
Laura: Oh, it's got a little deck.
Orion: Pike. Ashley. A three-inch figure of Pike is coming for you and a three-inch figure of Scanlan is coming. They're on their way.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous!
Orion: David.
Matt: It's your holy symbol.
Marisha: They're little flowers!
Zac: Hey, guys, we have some boxes of very special dice here, and they included a letter, but it says, "Please do not read on stream," so this is for you guys to read when we go offline, but we're going to hand these out as well.
Marisha: Holy crap.
Laura: Oh, this is for me!
Marisha: I'm pretty sure she has an Etsy store.
Taliesin: She does.
Laura: Oh my god, this is the best day ever.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous!
Liam: It's Critmas!
All: Critmas!
Liam: Whoa, look at that. That's a die, it's dangerous.
Travis: No it's not.
Matt: That's so cool, you guys are ridiculous.
Sam: Whoa, that's an awesome die!
Travis: Are you fucking kidding me?
Sam: Whoa, the first roll was a 20! (cheering)
Laura: This will never go in the dice graveyard.
Zac: Each one is unique to you guys, it's nuts.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Travis: Skulls!
Ashley: What? I got a Celtic knot!
Laura: This is the coolest thing ever.
Taliesin: Holy shit.
Marisha: What does yours look like?
Taliesin: Holy shit.
Laura: Let me see!
Ashley: Nice, what the heck!
Travis: It's made of skulls.
Laura: Wow, I got a 20!
Marisha: Whoa, with the whitewash on it.
Zac: Okay, wait.
Taliesin: I just rolled a 20! Look at it, look at it!
Marisha: Wait, did everyone roll 20s on their first roll?
Matt: These are magically enchanted handcrafted dice.
Travis: I rolled an eight.
Marisha: I rolled a four.
Matt: I got a Sputnik dice, by the way.
Ashley: Thank you so much!
Taliesin: Thank you so much!
Marisha: These are crazy! Holy balls!
Sam: Okay, a benefactor sent the holy charm of Sarenrae for me to present to you.
Marisha: Oh my gosh, that's so pretty!
Sam: In, I think, holy matrimony?
Ashley: Oh, well, let's just--
Matt: Ellie, these are all amazing. Thank you so much.
Laura: Thank you, thank you.
Ashley: Thank you, thank you.
Orion: A dragon-bone die for the dragonborn.
Matt: I've rolled nothing lower than a 16 on this die, so it gets used a lot moving forward.
Liam: Also, for my birthday I got (Gollum voice) precious.
Marisha: That's awesome!
Orion: Good job, guys.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous.
Zac: You guys are all going to post pictures to Twitter, right, because everyone's asking.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, this is happening.
Liam: (Gollum voice) Precious!
Zac: While these guys are still opening their presents, I wanted to-- go ahead.
Marisha: Ellie, whoever made the jewelry, to tweet at us and let us know her Etsy store.
Matt: Ellie did the dice, wasn't it, I think?
Marisha: Ellie did the dice.
Matt: Yeah, the pendants were--
Zac: Ellie did the dice.
Marisha: The pendants were from Ipec.
Laura: Oh, I've got to get all my presents in the picture.
Marisha: From @millena, let us know about your Etsy.
Ashley: Guys, thanks so much.
Matt: An awesome letter from Meghan Levann, cards from Meghan Levann's site, we're going to go ahead and pass these out, and I'll read this after the stream. That's so awesome, thank you so much, Meghan.
All: Thank you, Meghan!
Zac: While these guys are still going through their presents, I just want to remind you guys, thank you for tuning in, and tomorrow we have So You Don't Have To, and we're going to play Jazz Punk on the stream, and it's a lot of fun, and then after that we'll have Gather Your Party and IndieKate is joining us, the all-female punk band Blood Candy is joining us, and then we have the-- oh my gosh, I feel like a dumb-dumb now. What's the name of that-- the Dance Free Movement people? The group that threw the party for the guy that was shamed on the internet, the--
Matt: Mercer shirt. Dice on the back. DM represent.
Zac: I'm sure a lot of you guys heard about the man that was shamed on the internet.
Marisha: Yeah, the punk teenagers made fun of him?
Zac: Right. Made fun of him on the internet, and a large group of-- the Dance Free Movement came Together, flew him out to Los Angeles, and threw a big party for him, so we have the Dance Free Together group coming tomorrow to play Just Dance with us, to talk about their movement and everything like that, so make sure you guys tune in tomorrow, it's going to be a lot of a fun, that's from 7-10PM. And we had a couple more donations really quickly come in. Just wanted to say thank you to--
Matt: What's that?
Lucas: Did you read the dice on the shirt?
Matt: (laughs) Nice and hidden. Didn't notice that. The dice say, 'How do you want to do this?'
Laura: Awesome!
Taliesin: That's so cool.
Laura: Oh, that's really cool.
Zac: For the people that donated after we started reading the donations, I know Matt's trying to get outta here pretty quick, so thank you, FoxyForsythe, Zopher, Metheram and Hunter, I'll make sure these guys get the messages that you guys sent, but we're going to go ahead and let these guys start packing up. I know that they have lives!
Marisha: We're tweeting pictures of our dice and our things so everyone can see now.
Laura: I'm hashtagging Critmas.
Zac: Did we make that sub goal?
Orion: Oh my god, is that your die that you got?
Zac: We did not make the sub goal, so we'll get you guys-- no, we're not going to get it, so we'll get you guys with a giveaway tomorrow.
Matt: Next time, you can do it then. You guys are ridiculous, thank you so much. Have a wonderful night.
Ashley: Thank you guys so, so much.
Matt: See you next week on Thursday.
Marisha: We love you guys, you're amazing! [dramatic music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role. Before we kick things off we're going to do the videos in just a moment to intro as we're waiting for a member to arrive. But before we get started tonight we have a couple special giveaways getting all the subscriber counts we can get. First off if we hit 3500 subscribers tonight we're going to be giving away a player's handbook signed by the cast of Critical Role, a dicebox, and one of these fantastically reconstructed horns of Orcus torn recently from forehead of the mad beholder K'varn. We actually have two of these available tonight as part of the giveaways. The first one will be at 3500 the next one at 3550 with the same package: The player's handbook signed by everybody the dice box and one of these horn props which were made for us by the incredible KommissarProps. This is Kai Norman. Kai, want to come in and say hello to everyone?
Kai: Yeah!
Matt: Show off your good work here.
Kai: Thank you.
Matt: Show off your good work here.
Kai: Hey guys!
Kai: I guess I should show you a little bit about how they're built. They're resin. They're cast resin so they've got a little bit of rigid foam in the back so they've got this nice kind of bone marrow look and they're all hand painted by me and hopefully you guys will --
Marisha: He's super awesome.
Matt: It's a good start.
Marisha: You should totally go follow him at KommissarProps. It's kind of hard so I printed this out for you guys. Follow him on Instagram and on Facebook. That's where you see the most about this guy. And go check it out. It's good for the giveaway.
Matt: He's a talented guy. He's providing these for us for the giveaway tonight totally on his own and he's also going to be helping us with future possible prop stuff for the game as it progresses.
Marisha: You definitely want to go follow him. I actually tweeted a picture from your Instagram account, so for those of you who are following me, there's a direct link to his Instagram account. Or just search this on Facebook or Instagram.
Matt: Indeed.
Marisha: Do it. Do it now.
Matt: So we have those at 3500 and 3550. If we get to 3600 tonight, you'll get the t-shirt signed, a dice box, a starter kit and we'll stay after and play some more Just Dance. (cheers)
Matt: Yeah! Great!
Matt: Also want to give a big shoutout to -- we might have a bunch of new folks from imgur today -- someone put up a really cool post about us on imgur and a lot of people saw it, so those who came through that, hello, welcome, you're gonna sit in and watch a bunch of us silly folk play Dungeons & Dragons, so it should be fun hopefully. Welcome. In the meantime we'll go ahead and roll the videos, we'll get some history on some of the characters and we'll be back here in a few minutes.
Marisha: We'll be back. Go follow. And then we'll pull winners.
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things! ...also ale. In his early years, armed with his two handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst (brawling sounds) Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. (brawling sounds) the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this... well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. (weapon crack) Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike, that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! ...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for... lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first Impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder crack) based on first impressions. Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third child of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honour, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men. As they ran, Percy’s sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gun cocks and fires)
Ashley: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream. A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (creature growl and snapping) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he’s never known: the true love of a fellow Gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it’s rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes. I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the Elven capital of Singorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn’t last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough, (sword unsheathing and slashing) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Singorn, the isolated Elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -- her own stolen Trinket -- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable and gives expert massages.
Matt: Welcome back guys! We have some interesting aspects of playing tonight Orion Acaba will be here shortly, he's currently stuck in traffic. Unfortunately we will not have a Sam Riegel tonight, due to his schedule.
Ashley: Scanlan?!
Marisha: No Scanlan.
Matt: Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham, our loving Grog and Vex, are out of town in Florida but are Skyping in via modern technology.
Laura: Technology? What's it all about?
Marisha: We can actually see you guys pretty good.
Matt: We're going to try and make this work.
Marisha: It's pretty cool.
Zac: We're getting audio set up right now.
Matt: So we're getting this figured out. They'll stay in play as long as they can. They are three hours ahead of us. To be fair, we have friends across the coast that get up at 4am to watch this
Laura: That's true.
Matt: You should hang around long as you can. (strange monkey noises)
Matt: You should hang around long as you can.
Matt: We can't hear you right now. (strange monkey noises) (more monkey noises)
Matt: It's even better.
Matt: So as they're figuring this out guys. We'll let you know, we've already hit our first milestone for subs.
Matt: So we have a winner. The winner of our first package, which includes the player's handbook signed by everybody, the dice, and one horn of Orcus torn from the forehead of K'varn... Is the esteemed RhymesWithOrange! Congratulations RhymesWithOrange, you are the first winner of the horn. (everyone claps)
Matt: Well done. So we'll get that sent out --
Taliesin: Are you taking a selfie with the iPad?
Marisha: (laughs)
Taliesin: Sorry.
Matt: (sighs)
Taliesin: Sorry.
Matt: It's alright. So --
Marisha: Thank you again to our friend Kai Norman at KommissarProps for making the horn, go follow him. It's awesome. KommisarProps on Instagram and Facebook
Matt: Our next giveaway is at 3550. And we will give away the second and only other horn, as well as the rest of that package. And at 3600 we're going to do t-shirt signed, dice box, starter kit and we're going to be dancing for you afterwards. Let's see if we can get that by tonight. Also, want to give you guys a heads up, we've wanted to get some confirmation to you guys about the episode releases after the live show. Because we have a lot of people who watch the show who can't watch it live.
Matt: The episodes are available immediately afterward on Twitch if you're a subscriber. So the morning after the show, if you're a subscriber, you get to watch the episodes immediately afterward. Plus you're helping us keep this channel going. All the subscription money goes toward maintaining the channel, all the people that work here throughout the week, all the other amazing hosts and people that actually run the programs here. So you help make this channel function.
Marisha: Only subscribers get access to the archives.
Matt: -- archives immediately. However --
Laura: (coughs) However --
Matt: -- volume.
Matt: To finish this thought, for those who aren't subscribers, episodes do go up now every Monday, that's going to be the confirmed time period of release.
Matt: So you can look forward to episodes up on the Geek & Sundry website every Monday. That's the scenario.
Matt: So, given that case, whenever Orion gets here he'll hop in, in the meantime, let's go ahead and start this game up.
Matt: So.
Ashley: All right here we go.
Matt: So, for those of us who --
Matt: Just a little heads up here, the party has just returned after a long arduous trek through The Underdark, beneath the Dwarven city of Kraghammer.
Matt: They were sent to retrieve a paladin named Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest to stop some dark evil that her deity Bahamut told her was existing beneath this mountain range, and needed to be squelched.
Matt: The party managed to salvage her from insidious torture, and through her aid as well as a Mind Flayer who had been outcast from the society and the colony nearby.
Matt: They managed to convince to help them as well, fought their way through the tunnels, past the Duergar army, eventually to the underground Mindflayer colony of Yogg Voril where they found that this entity called K'varn. This was then eventually revealed to be a mad beholder, K'varn, who had been pseudo possessed and given additional power by the Horn of Orcus, a great and evil artifact long forgotten, which had been found by this entity. So they managed to make their way into the temple, kill K'varn, tear the horn from it's forehead, however found themselves swarmed immediately by an entire colony of mind flayers heading toward the top of this temple. They managed to battle and battle, nearly losing a few party members, and through some ingenuity, escape through the top, glide over the city of Yogg Voril through this underground chasm to a distant embankment along the beachside of this underground lake. And teleport their way back to their base city of Emon. So they've come back to Emon, they've come to their keep, Greyskull Keep, and they've had an evening of rest. Upon waking the next morning, they've managed to get some breakfast, they've freed Lady Kima from her stone entrapment as she was turned to stone during the battle with the beholder, and had a conversation based around what should or could be done about this Horn of Orcus evil artifact. So here we will pick up again from that point. So the rest of you guys have eaten your meal, Kima hungrily doing so. All of you guys both sore and exhausted having barely seen sunlight for a little over a week and being probably the first or second good meal you've had since leaving Kraghammer proper. You all finish your food, Grog hungrily so, double the size of his normal intake of delicious meats and starches. Tiberius has not seemed to have woken up or found his way down from his room as of yet. However, you guys did recently receive a rolled up piece of parchment. A notification from the council of Tal’Dorei, saying that you have been requested to the council chambers at some point this afternoon, around the mid-day sun, to discuss your return and the situation and conditions about it. And that was all it said.
Liam: I can't remember is Lady Kima with us at this point? Is she unstoned?
Matt: She's unstoned, you've already had the conversation with her last week talking about the horn, basically interrogating her.
Liam: And we said that we had it somewhere safe, but weren't we playing coy with that?
Matt: You were playing coy with it but you --
Ashley: I had gone downstairs to go get Grog.
Matt: Yes, Grog returned with it and you guys had the conversation basically saying ‘Oh, it's safe, don't worry. It's fine’. Grog at which currently has it in the bag of holding.
Marisha: But we haven't told her that it's in the bag of holding right?
Matt: No you just said you have it somewhere safe.
Marisha: We just said we have it somewhere safe.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Turn them up a little bit.
Taliesin: I am highly entertained.
Liam: I think we're getting feedback.
Matt: Oh, I see.
Marisha: Oh yeah, that's us.
Laura: Right! That would be us.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Sorry about that.
Ashley: We'll figure this out guys.
Marisha: That wasn't too bad.
Matt: This is the new attempt at technology with our out-of-towners.
Taliesin: It's amazing.
Marisha: It's working pretty well.
Taliesin: It is working pretty well.
Marisha: I'm kind of impressed.
Taliesin: Have we actually opened up the parchment and read it yet?
Matt: Yes, you have received it and you've inspected it.
Ashley: It's Tiberius.
Orion: Hey everybody.
Marisha: Yes.
Laura: Hey boo.
Taliesin: I don't know what's going to happen.
Matt: He's going to crawl under the table. There you have it.
Liam: Good morning sleepyhead.
Orion: Hi guys.
Matt: As a couple hours have passed --
Marisha: Good morning Tiberius.
Orion: Hi. Right.
Orion: Hello.
Orion: Am I here?
Liam: Yes you've just come down the stairs.
Matt: You've just now come down after many hours of breakfast have passed. It's now pushing around 11:00 in the afternoon comparatively, and Tiberius comes storming into the main dining hall of your keep.
Orion: Morning everyone.
Marisha: What is that?
Orion: This is my own bag of holding.
Orion: And I walk over to Grog and I open their bag of holding and take out my wheel of mending and I put it in here.
Laura: You got your own bag of holding?!
Orion: That's what I needed the extra gold for before I left.
Marisha: Where did you go to get that?
Orion: We're face-timing?
Marisha: Where did you go to get that?
Orion: Hey! Hi Guys!
Taliesin: Science.
Liam: We are the coolest.
Orion: I was like that's, "That's Laura's voice, where the hell is that coming from?"
Ashley: At least we think we're cool.
Marisha: At least we think we're cool.
Orion: Travis is there too! Sorry!
Orion: I mean.. Yes.
Liam: So Tiberius we're just waiting for you to awake. I think we should probably go and see the emperor, like you do. Talk about the little problem we have.
Marisha: Wait. Where did you go and get a bag of holding in the time of us sleeping and you waking up.
Orion: If you recall, I actually went to Draconia... when we all woke up to begin with.
Marisha: You didn't tell us that.
Orion: Why would I have to tell you?
Marisha: I didn't say you didn't have to, I'm just saying you acted like I should know and I'm saying I had no idea.
Orion: I could have sworn I cast that and said that last game.
Matt: No, you just stayed in your room and did it on your own.
Orion: Oh shit. (all laugh)
Marisha: Yeah. So right now you're crazy to me.
Orion: Right. Okay.
Taliesin: I'm also a little disturbed that it looks like that bag of holding is made of you.
Marisha: Yes it does look like it's made of drag -- that seems cruel.
Orion: Actually this is wyvern skin. We use it in the air force of the Draconian army. And when the --
Ashley: Air force?
Orion: Yes. Draconia has an army, 500 standing, 200 are airborne.
Marisha: But they have an air force?
Orion: Yes. Keyleth: Do they fly-- nevermind.
Taliesin: No, they just blow, they force air.
Marisha: (laughs)
Orion: We have trained and tamed wyverns which we have utilized and they are part of our culture.
Taliesin: I've never seen a skinned one.
Orion: Yes. And so I went to the local "shoppe" and purchased a bag of holding because I realized that I did not hold my own wheel of mending for a long time.
Taliesin: That was frustrating you, wasn't it?
Orion: It was extremely frustrating. Especially because it's my artifact.
Orion: Yes.
Marisha: Well that's good. It's probably good to have a second one of those.
Marisha: And it comes with water, how handy.
Orion: It holds a lot of things!
Marisha: How fantastic.
Taliesin: We should probably get off to see what the emperor wants.
Orion: Before we do that --
Orion: Where's Scanlan now?
Marisha: Not here.
Matt: Scanlan is currently in the room eating breakfast
Orion: We're all eating breakfast still right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: Hi everybody.
Liam: Not you, you've apparently been globe shopping.
Orion: Right. Scanlan? I was thinking about our last encounter.
Orion: I'm going to take off my ion stone that's kinda chilling.
Orion: This is a particular thing that you've seen me use several times. And I notice in the last couple of battles you've actually literally run out of spells to cast. I propose a friendly trade. The crown on your head allows you to do certain things which you have not utilized the last several rounds you've owned it. It seems you've actually complained about not having extra spells to cast.
Liam: Rounds of what?
Orion: --rounds of battle, Vax.
Liam: Oh.
Orion: I don't know. (all laugh)
Orion: So I assume that you could probably actually use this more. I have a tool that allows me to do it to begin with and it's come in rather handy as you've seen. What say you, Scanlan?
Matt: Scanlan looks to you and thinks for a second and goes
Sam: You know what. I'm going to think on that.
Marisha: (laughs)
Sam: Wait untill I'm more rested and solid and sound mind before I can make any sort of arrangements or trades here. It would be unfair, given our current state of -- (all laugh)
Liam: It's true Scanlan, you should probably wait until you're feeling a little more present.
Ashley: Wonderful plan Scanlan.
Sam: Agreed, agreed.
Sam: A couple hours at the local brothel and all should be fine.
Matt: He cracks his fingers, expectantly.
Liam: Welcome back, even though we didn't know you were gone. I've eaten. The rest of us have eaten --
Ashley: Were you gone all night?
Orion: No, just for about an hour.
Marisha: Oh.
Orion: It was a good trip. I needed it.
Ashley: Just saying hello to family and that?
Orion: No I just literally went to a shop I knew in Draconia and picked up the item. I wasn't sure if they had any in Emon and didn't really want to waste any time looking for one.
Ashley: Well...
Liam: Good on you, shall we go to meet the emperor?
Taliesin: I've eaten, let's politic.
Liam: I think so.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: This is so --
Matt: Can you guys hear us fine?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Just making sure.
Laura: Too scared to talk is all.
Marisha: Scared to talk?
Liam: Chime in, please.
Matt: Feel free to chime in whenever.
Liam: One of us, one of us.
Travis: Balls. Taint. Ale. Nipples.
Matt: That's our Grog.
Ashley: Hey, there's Grog.
Marisha: Grog!
Matt: As our wonderful giant, now filled with various forms of delicious food matter warm in his belly, gives a string of various curse words in enjoyment, and sits up from the table with a loud fart and you guys make your way out of Greyskull Keep.
Matt: Towards the outer wall of Emon, in towards the entrance to Abedar's Promenade, making your way towards the Cloudtop District where the palace itself resides. Is there any place --
Laura: Is Lady Kima with us?
Matt: Lady Kima is with you, yes.
Taliesin: Good.
Matt: Is there anything else you want to do or are you guys making a beeline for the palace?
Orion: I would like to take another 500 gold from the treasury before we do that. And I do.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Wait, what?
Liam: From the treasury.
Liam: You have to ask the treasurer.
Laura: How much do you want?
Orion: Five hundred to replenish the 500 that I initially took. I don’t know if I will have to spend it at all, and if I do, I will completely share my plan with all of you. But I would like to see how what we do plays out next.
Laura: Another 500?
Orion: Yes.
Orion: That's all I do. That's all I want to do.
Matt: Anything else?
Liam: Have we had contact with Allura? Since returning?
Matt: Nuh uh.
Liam: Not yet?
Liam: I feel good about her being at this meeting.
Ashley: Someone just got really excited when we mentioned the name Allura.
Orion: I cast prestidigitation on myself and make robes are all super clean and nice.
Matt: Got you.
Matt: As you guys walk into the center of the Cloudtop District, you can see that her ivory tower, which once collapsed around you, is now standing in it's previous location, seemingly untouched and back to it's original esteemed visual.
Taliesin: That is the question, do we stop in first or do we go straight to --
Liam: Was there a time requested on there?
Matt: It said around the noon day sun. It's probably about 30 minutes give or take.
Liam: Allura's really the only person I trust.
Taliesin: Perhaps we should not walk into the palace with this on us, so to speak.
Liam: We don't have anything on us.
Taliesin: No, we don't, but if we did we should probably deal with it.
Taliesin: What.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: No. Yes. (laughs)
Liam: Tibbsy. Let's go ring Allura's bell.
Travis: I'd like to ring her bell.
Taliesin: It's like having the internet right there.
Liam: So I just start walking off towards Allura's tower.
Orion: I'll follow Vax.
Matt: Okay. Everyone else go with them?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: So you guys trek your way towards the northern edge of the Cloudtop District. You round about the series of very nice, fine marbled houses, finely crafted stone. This is the affluent area of Emon proper. It's in the secondary city wall, which of course the upper echelon of merchants and those who have money are offered the secondary form of defense against the town being sieged at all.
Matt: You come around the corner on the fine kind of yellowish cobblestone road, turn, and you get to the point where you can see to the left of you is the giant courtyard that surrounds the outskirts of the palace proper. With the giant steps that lead up to the darkened purple marble that the entire structure is made out of. To your right, there's a few buildings and the white ivory tower that Allura lives in. You approach, the front door is closed. It still remains that giant iron knocker on the front that hangs loosely, like a giant wishbone that you slam into the front of the wooden doorway.
Matt: Give it a couple hits? (Vax nods)
Matt: You can hear it echo throughout the interior of the tall standing tower. A few moments pass, you hear the movement of chain. A creaking of metal and then a -- some sort of large shifting of a wood platform or plank. The door then creaks open and there standing, a little bleary eyed, slept-in a bit, but in the process of getting ready, you see before you Arcanist Allura. Her long blonde hair is half braided. She's in her darkened blue robes. You're used to seeing her in and see -- She opens the door, the sunlight hitting her eye. She protects her vision for a second before they focus on the rest of the group and she goes,
Matt: "My lord, you've all arrived! You've all arrived!"
Matt: And she swings the door opens and runs forward immediately to you, the first person that's there and she gives you a big hug.
Matt: She holds back and gives you a look over.
Matt: Her eyes are opened. You can see how honestly eager and happy to see that everyone's here safe.
Liam: I look over at Tiberius and just short of sheepishly shrug.
Orion: I'm used to it, it's fine.
Matt: She turns over to give Pike a big hug. She makes her way around the rest of the group.
Matt: "You're all... I'm so glad to see you're all back. I've heard there was some difficulties happening in Kraghammer at the time you arrived."
Matt: She turns around and takes your hands, Keyleth, into her own and gives you a nod and a small hug. Goes to Percy and gives you a hug. Goes to Tiberius and gives you a big warm hug.
Matt: She slowly pulls away. She acquiesces to your longer hug... And then... pushes away.
Orion: It is nice to see you again.
Matt: "The pleasure is mine."
Laura: (sings) Awkward. Everyone: (laughs)
Matt: "The pleasure is mine, Tiberius."
Matt: And as she turns around, she sees standing behind the rest of you, there's Kima. There in her now freshly cleaned golden armor that she polished over the evening so she doesn't smell of Duergar sweat and blood anymore.
Liam: We've brought you a present.
Matt: There's this moment where they both look at each other quietly. And then Allura steps forward and says,
Matt: "Kima. Welcome back."
Matt: And they both just run and give this big embracing bear hug. She lifts Kima up and there's a slow spin. You can see this very very strong bond of friendship before she eventually puts Kima down and takes a little bit, she holds her hands for a second. You can see a tear running down Allura's cheek.
Matt: "I was so worried about you."
Matt: And Kima sheepishly turns her eyes to the side and says,
Matt: "Sorry for the all the trouble."
Orion: Story of my life. (all laugh)
Orion: Seriously Matthew?! Come on!
Matt: What?! (all laugh)
Matt: They're good friends.
Liam: Friends! Friends!
Marisha: (laughs)
Orion: Friends.
Matt: Your assumptions, dragonborn. (all laugh)
Liam: Don't mug yourself.
Taliesin: That's great.
Liam: Come correct. Don't mug yourself.
Matt: (laughs)
Matt: They take a moment to just nod at each other. She reaches her hand out in front of Kima's head and rustles her hair for a second and says,
Matt: "You had many of us worried sick you can't keep running off like that."
Matt: And Kima says,
Matt: "I know, I know."
Matt: Then Allura turns to the rest of the group and says,
Matt: "Thank you all so, so very much. You've done the realm and myself a great service in bringing her back."
Matt: At which point, Kima says,
Matt: "Bring me back? They helped me complete my quest! You've made some strong allies, Allie."
Matt: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says,
Marisha: Allie?
Matt: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says,
Matt: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready."
Laura: I like it.
Matt: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready."
Matt: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready. You all look like you could use it to be honest."
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: "Come. Please."
Taliesin: Well, all right.
Orion: I love tea.
Taliesin: We have a moment we can spend.
Liam: Long story.
Matt: So as you guys all walk into her tower, you remember it untouched from your previous entry here. It's a weird moment to step into a tower that you were once in as it crumbled and folded on itself, to see it as if nothing had ever happened.
Taliesin: Is there a new rug?
Matt: There is not.
Taliesin: Ah-hah!
Laura: Hmm..
Marisha: We're not giving it back.
Laura: We shouldn't tell her about the rug.
Marisha: Don't tell her about the rug.
Matt: You guys step into the center of the room and she's talking to herself for a moment, saying
Matt: "Things have been a bit crazy here, obviously. Now that the floodgates have opened as far as discussions with the council and people who have maintained a backlog for a while. It's been a bit busy. But, this is a wonderful moment to respite. I'm greatly enjoying the company to be honest. Come."
Matt: She guides you all to the center of the chamber. Once again, there's that large stone platform in the center that has a number of the inert runes carved into the stonework. As you all step onto it, she taps her heel against the bottom of it for a second. As she does, all the runes glow with a bright flash of blue and a familiar sensation as that circular platform begins to lift like an arcane elevator, up the center of the tower, going up one, two, three stories. And as you're going up you're seeing certain sections of wooden library shelves set up at odd angles along the top of the arcane tower itself. You can see there are small stairways that lead off into doorways that seem to almost exit into the sky.
Matt: You've gotten into the idea that a lot of these powerful mage-built towers, the inner workings don't really match the outer exterior look. And there are rooms that shouldn't exist at certain points as you lift up.
Liam: I'd like to make a perfunctory insight check just to see if there's anything hinky.
Orion: I'd like to google perfunctory real quick.
Matt: You can do that. Go for it.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: On Allura?
Liam: Yeah, everything's probably fine. That's an 18.
Matt: Best that you can gather, she looks like she's a bit groggy, having slept in recently. But she seems extremely excited you've all returned and seems eager to catch up as far as what has transpired since last you met her.
Matt: The platform continues before it reaches the topmost floor of the tower before the slowing of the stone platform eventually comes to a halt with a slight jostling. The runes fade and you're all on the top floor of the tower once again. This is her main chamber. You can see across the way there is her large cush canopy bed in the far corner. There are a number of desks. There's a small arcane laboratory on the far side. Looks like it's in a bit of disarray, as she's probably in the middle of a project.
Matt: You do hear, as soon as you arrive, it sounds like the whistle of a tea kettle in the distance. At which point, she says,
Matt: "Ah! Allow me."
Matt: And she begins to walk over. She lifts her hand and you see a small drift of arcane energy as her mage hand goes and lifts, takes the water off of it's burner, and begins to absent mindedly mage-hand various teacups out of a large cabinet above the little kitchenette area.
Ashley: That's awesome. (all laugh)
Matt: At which point, everyone's looking around, Kima, amongst the rest of you guys, says,
Matt: "It's been awhile since I've been here. Everything's as grandiose and unnecessarily dressed as it always is. I'm glad you got rid of that old rug though."
Laura: (laughs) (scattered coughing)
Liam: Sorry.
Liam: (coughs)
Ashley: Was there a rug?
Liam: I'm fine.
Taliesin: I don't remember that.
Marisha: Stay cool. Come on.
Travis: This rug?
Laura: Nope.
Taliesin: Nope.
Ashley: Nope.
Taliesin: Not here.
Matt: Allura, who is now in the process of pulling chairs over and setting up a small sitting arrangement, a semi-circle, and says,
Marisha: It’s so cute.
Matt: "The last time the tower collapsed and I was so rudely assaulted in my living quarters, it appears my rug went missing. It's all right. I've kept my eye out for a new one for some time."
Orion: That was unfortunate.
Liam: Magic, it's tricky.
Orion: I had no idea. I jumped out when that happened.
Taliesin: Speaking of tricky magic.
Matt: She gives a slow, knowing look about the group. And gives a nod like, 'I acquiesce to this, that's fine'.
Marisha: You should have some potted plants, Allura. Like some nice greenery.
Taliesin: You're going to try and feng shui the tower, is that what you--
Marisha: Well, why not.
Taliesin: I don't know.
Matt: "That's not a bad idea. Perhaps we'll discuss this."
Liam: This is silly.
Liam: Allura, it's a long story. Lot of deurgar, lot of mindflayer, lot of mindflayers, and an evil god?
Taliesin: A beholder.
Orion: Yes, moreover, a beholder.
Liam: Yes, but who was pulling the strings behind the beholder.
Marisha: He thought he was an evil god. A beholder with a god complex?
Matt: "Curious."
Matt: At which point, as you say that, she does this with her fingers, and all the chairs rush in underneath you guys. And you're put into a sitting position. As you all sit, she begins to slowly mage-hand over each one of you a freshly poured cup of tea.
Matt: A look of concern comes across her face.
Matt: "So you found your way beneath the city, I assume based on the denizens you've mentioned, into the underdark proper. A beholder you say? Mindflayers you say?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "I first off must apologize, I was not aware I was putting you into such dangerous territory."
Orion: Ha! It was really dangerous! It was nothing, filled with just buttholes everywhere. Terrible.
Matt: "That sounds like a terrible city."
Orion: Mhm..
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: "Well, first and foremost, I apologize for that. I am incredibly grateful you're all seemingly healthy and still here. And you've brought Kima back to us which is very important."
Matt: "Well, I guess this is in order."
Matt: And she sits up for a second and walks over. And you can see she looks back at the rest of you and brushes her hand for a second. A sphere of darkness appears in the corner of the room where you can not see an entire part of the room. And she sits there and hovers. Just a little pocket of darkness.
Marisha: Aw, man.
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: You hear some rustling.
Marisha: We've been in darkness so long.
Matt: You hear some rustling.
Matt: You hear some rustling.
Matt: The sphere of darkness finishes and you see she's holding a sack of coins, that you don't know where she picked them up from.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: She steps back over to her chair, sits down, and says,
Matt: "Just a precaution, I like to keep my private things private. But, a deal is a deal and you've done as you've asked. So as we've discussed, 10,000 gold pieces, to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks."
Laura: I take that. "to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks." (all laugh)
Matt: She hands it out to Vex's eager palm. It's very heavy.
Laura: Good thing I'm strong then, huh?
Matt: With her 9 strength, it sags.
Laura: Sorry about the hand gesture there, stop it. (all laugh)
Matt: Internet.
Matt: She sits back down, says,
Matt: "You tell me what else if anything has transpired, and I'll let you know what you've missed."
Ashley: Well.
Orion: We have Orcus's horn. So that's a thing.
Matt: There's a slight pause before the actual sound of breaking glass hits your ears as the teacup that she's holding shatters across the stonework on the floor.
Matt: Allura, still sitting in her chair, hands in place and says
Matt: "I'm sorry, what did you say?"
Orion: Yes, that beholder butthole that we had to fight, that we had no idea we had to fight, had this Orcus horn on his head. So we took it off and we kept it safe. That's what you wanted I'm assuming, to destroy it.
Laura: But we haven't touched it though.
Orion: No.
Matt: "All right."
Matt: She looks over to Kima, who does this with her shoulders up. Kima gives her a nod and says,
Matt: "To be honest, I wasn't sure that was the end of my journey. But it seems that great evil I talked about before, we killed it and took its source of power. Now we're figuring out what to do with it."
Matt: She gives a sheepish grin and a slight shrug in her armor. Allura looks to the ground for a moment and says,
Matt: "I don't know much of this object you say, but if it was the source of the creature's power, and it carries with it the connotations of Orcus, then this is a very, very ill omen indeed."
Orion: Yes.
Matt: "This must be brought before the council immediately."
Orion: Wait.
Marisha: The council?
Orion: The council?
Matt: "The council of Tal'Dorei, the council you are part of."
Orion: That helps.
Ashley: Are you going there, right now, also?
Matt: "Yes, I was summoned to it."
Ashley: We were as well.
Orion: Here's the thing.
Orion: Sorry, Pike. The thing with this particular item is, the more people know about it, the more dangerous it actually becomes. The fact that we even share this information with Kima and with you is a very dangerous thing to begin with.
Matt: "I agree."
Orion: Are the council trustworthy?
Matt: "Those who currently reside on the council are trustworthy, I assure you this. I've done my work with them for many years, and those that have passed have been replaced with equally trustworthy individuals. And, rest assured, I have my checks and balances in place as well."
Liam: I think what we're worried about most is the corrupting nature of this thing. And while the council may have good intentions, I think more than a few of us are somewhat nervous. What effect it might have on them, on us.
Matt: "Can you assess what the mistrust would be to not bring this before the sovereign and the council?"
Orion: Namely, if the immediate want is for it to be immediately destroyed, because that's what needs to happen with anything from Orcus, as you very well know.
Matt: "I understand, and I don't think you'll find anyone who disagrees. But I also don't think you should sow mistrust with the council by keeping any of this information from them."
Marisha: It's not about trust.
Laura: Uriel has been corrupted once already.
Marisha: Exactly.
Matt: "This is true, and was it not by your hand that he was freed and his family kept safe? Understand, that this is a man that owes you him and his family's life. I think he would take in to you, his ear bent in your direction quite strongly."
Marisha: Correct, but couldn't you also safely say that he is therefore fairly easy corruptible? If he had been corrupted before, even not if subconsciously, I'm not saying intentionally, but he clearly...
Matt: "You would know best what was responsible for corrupting our sovereign, as you did fight and one was felled, by it's own strength."
Marisha: I'm saying Lady Allura, that there is essences, there seems to be magical properties to this horn that corrupt even some of the strongest willed individuals.
Matt: "Then we must be rid of it quickly. And I think we need to at least discuss this with the council, if not present it. Bring it to their attention. There are ways, arcane... not very approved ways, of nullifying targeted memories." "The rest of the arcana pentsafocal have banned the use of such magics but if we could have approval, understanding the safety concerns of this object from the council we could override the arcana pentsafocal and I could employ some of these magics to make sure that once this artifact is destroyed or taken somewhere to never be found again, we ourselves perhaps would not recall it ever existed. And that itself is the safest course of action."
Orion: I agree.
Liam: I think that we trust you. And you trust the council. That's enough for me.
Taliesin: That's enough for me as well.
Marisha: Pike? Where do you stand.
Orion: That's definitely enough for me.
Marisha: Pike? Where do you stand.
Orion: Just so you know Allura --
Orion: I might have a solution as well for actually destroying it, so I will follow your lead.
Taliesin: I think the best course of action is to trust people.
Liam: And we're incapable of destroying the thing on our own.
Orion: Oh, that's not true at all. I might have a solution which I just shared with Allura. I'm letting her take the lead on this, and when the situation presents itself I might have a solution to destroy it outright.
Laura: Why don't you share that with us now Tiberius, instead of keeping it secret?
Liam: Just give us a rough sketch, maybe? instead of keeping it secret?
Orion: Very well.
Orion: I'll pull out my bag of holding.
Orion: This.
Marisha: The mending wheel?
Orion: No, the bag.
Laura: An empty fist?
Liam: He pulled out the bag.
Marisha: Okay. Would you care to elaborate, Tiberius?
Orion: I'm sorry. This part of the thing I wanted to tell all of you at breakfast. The idea is, with some research I've come to find that if anything is in a bag of holding, and the bag of holding itself is destroyed, the items or whatever go into a somewhat void, that cannot be retrieved by any one particular thing. If we are to have our memories erased, as you say, then it would guarantee that when we place the thing in a bag of holding and destroy that bag, it will then be dissipated into that void.
Matt: At which point, Allura raises her hand and says,
Matt: "Tiberius. You, as a very trained sorcerer, have some knowledge in this regard. I've been crafting bags of holding since I was a child as a way of keeping my weekends busy. I have to notify you that should such a pocket of interdimensional arcane space is disrupted in this way, it doesn't send it into a void. It jettisons the contents into the Astral Sea. The Astral Sea which has many denizens that could come across this object. Githyanki themselves and their great ships."
Orion: I hate yankees.
Matt: "Gith --nevermind."
Ashley: So it could be bad.
Orion: There are things --
Matt: "There are many things that exist in the Astral Sea that could recover this item. I'm not saying there isn't merit to this, but I think it would be best we put it somewhere where at least we know for certain no one will find it, as opposed to just hoping it disappears somewhere."
Orion: But the memory thing is crucial.
Marisha: What about those who might be uncomfortable with toying around with my memories and tramping along around in my head, I don't really want --
Liam: Why don't you think about it for a while?
Travis: My head's pretty fragile as it is.
Liam: We're talking about erasing the path back to this thing, we're not talking about removing your adolescent years from your memory. Just this one thing.
Travis: All right.
Marisha: How many lessons have we learned in just the time. Wouldn't we have to erase all memories surrounding it? We wouldn't even remember our trip into the underdark?
Taliesin: I think we could perhaps just erase the memory of where we put it.
Orion: That is what I assume will happen.
Matt: "That is possible. Like I've said, these magics have not been tampered with in nearly 200 years."
Marisha: So we're gonna break the seal on some untampered-with magics and just experiment.
Matt: "I am part of a group that oversees civilization. I can't go into too much detail but they are responsible for keeping such ancient magics, long forgotten magics such as this. I would have to meet with and discuss and gain approval for its use. But for an item as dangerous as what you say, perhaps this is one of those special occasions."
Liam: She's working for the Illuminati and we're basically the A-team, so I think she might know a little better.
Taliesin: The A-team?
Marisha: What do you think, Pike?
Ashley: I feel like at this point we don't really have another option.
Ashley: And I do trust Allura.
Orion: I'm all tapped out.
Ashley: And I do trust Allura.
Ashley: So I feel like if we just go check it out. I don't really know what our other option is.
Ashley: That was a good one.
Liam: And if we don't like it we can step.
Taliesin: And if we don't like it we can keep thinking of something else. We have time.
Matt: "This is true. And who knows what wisdom the rest of the council might have in their midst as well."
Matt: "They have members from all across the world. We'll see which resources they have at their disposal."
Taliesin: I'm sure they're waiting for us.
Matt: "I am glad to be free of my usual business. Are you guys familiar with the Wilder Fens?"
Liam: Sorry? The Wilder Fens?
Matt: "The Wilder Fens? They're a bloody merchant guild. They've left our chambers in shambles. Look, since you've been gone and the council map has been brought brought up to speed once more, we've had to deal with the backlog of all the various council meetings that have been pushed back and pushed back for months and months. It's been rather nightmarish. So this, all dangerous as it is, I'm taking it as a nice change from the usual, pardon my speaking, political bullshit I've been dragged into on a weekly basis. Between Wilder Fens, and there was the Cortigian League from Wildmount, and they just tore through Emon with a caravan of partying gypsies that destroyed everything in their path."
Marisha: Who?
Orion: Damn gypsies.
Matt: "The Cortian League."
Marisha: The Cortian League.
Matt: "From Wildmount, the north."
Taliesin: We fought stitch monsters, that was mostly what we... it was guns and swords and...
Matt: "It's far more interesting. Most of our guests have been a bit rough around the edges. Although I would say we did manage to meet with Syldor of Syngorn. We have some business there getting Syngorn situated."
Laura: Oh, Syldor!
Matt: "And Lord and Lady Briarwood were rather nice to us when they came into the town. So, business has been... fair."
Taliesin: Shall we take this to the council then?
Liam: Yes, we have pressing matters. We'll get to that later.
Matt: "All right. Let's go to the council then."
Matt: As you guys make your way back down through the tower, you eventually venture through the castletop district in front of the palace. The guards stand there with their long, red, velvet cloaks and their brass breastplates. They recognize both Allura and you as you approach. They step aside, put their spears toward the steps, and give you a grand entrance to the front of the palace.
Matt: As you step up, the front doors open on their own with a large heavy shaking of the wood. As the palace doors open, you are led into the central chambers of the main palace walkway which splits to the right and left, and then across leads into the main throne room. However, you guys are meeting in the council room which is to the left. You've been there twice before.
Matt: So you're led over to the council chambers, which, as you enter the main circular room, you're brought into the nice hardwood floors, the dark forest green colored walls, these long tapestries which recall various battles of history and broad mountainous landscapes showing settlers making their way across dangerous terrain. You can see various weapons from different civilizations that were brought up as gifts to Emon that have been mounted on the walls as presentory atmospheric decor. And in the central room, you can see what currently stands, the entirety of the Tal'Dorei council, in a hushed discussion. The council, of course, has at the center, across the table from you, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the Second himself. The leader of Emon and the current Sovereign of all of Tal'Dorei, this section of the continent. You see him with his characteristic dark hair, with greying sides, cut shorter than you recall. Looks like he recently got a trim and some very well kept facial hair. He's wearing his ceremonial robes which are the same gold and red color as the armored soldiers that greeted you at the front of the palace. Next to him, you see Lord Riskell Daxio, the elven male who helped you guys handle the purchasing of the keep when you were awarded that at the end of your last journey. He's the Master of Trade currently within Emon. You can see he has long strawberry blonde hair that is pulled into a tight ponytail to the back. He wears darker clothing, more for decoration than actual use. His armor seems to be loose and more decorative. Next to him is Guardian Tofor Brotorus, which you've heard of but have not met before. A female dragonborn paladin.
Marisha: Say that one more time? Guardian who's a what now?
Matt: Guardian Tofor Bratoras.
Marisha: To-for?
Matt: T-O-F-O-R. Bratoras. Her name's been mentioned before but this is the first time you guys have actually seen her in person.
Ashley: It's a girl?
Matt: It's a female dragonborn paladin. She is adorned in full, silvered platinum plate. That has currently carved multiple symbols of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. As she looks up and notices, you can see she gives a hand up, a symbol of greetings towards Kima. As Kima also gives her hand up and they both touch the front of their armor in a symbolic holy way, they both being followers of Bahamut. You immediately make that religious connection between the two of them. She looks across at the rest of the group there that she doesn't seem to notice, eyes meeting with Tiberius. This is strange. You haven't seen very many dragonborn at all within Emon, and as soon as she meets your gaze, she gives you a look of deep, deep stinkeye.
Orion: Hello. My name is Tiberius Stormwind. Of House Stormwind, from Draconia. Tofor: "From Draconia, you say?"
Orion: Yes. I'm sure you've heard of my father Kravanas, my mother Penelope? Tofor: "And perhaps you should close that trap and sit across the table as far from me as possible. "
Matt: She seems to spit the words almost, and sits back in her chair.
Orion: Mind your tongue.
Matt: The rest of the council's talking amongst themselves and hearing this slight discussion. Next to her there is a halfling male, in a ranger-ish garb, wearing what looks like some really fine chain shirt, with a thick dark black cloak. He is shaved bald with tattoos on one side of his face, and he introduces himself.
Matt: "I'm terribly, sorry. I did not mean for there to be any sort of misunderstanding here."
Matt: He gives a slight nudge to Tofor.
Matt: "I do not believe we've met at this time. My name is Seeker Asum Emring. I am the master of secrets here within the council."
Matt: He extends his hand towards you, almost like alleviating the tension.
Orion: Hi. Stormwind here. Seeker Asum: "I assume you're the ones we're waiting for, please have a seat."
Matt: At which the sovereign finishes discussion with another human which you have not met. He is a built and armored individual, stands probably the tallest of the entire group, thick square jaw, unshaven. At which point he puts his hand on the sovereign's shoulder and says,
Matt: "I suppose I should introduce myself as well. I've heard much about you, Vox Machina. I am Arbiter Braum Goldhand. I have recently taken up as of three months ago the position that General Kreig once held within the city. Since he was unfortunately lost to us, there was a need for a new master of law. As since I've had a lot to keep up on. Unable to meet you personally until now, but it is a pleasure. I've heard nothing but great things."
Matt: He sits down in his chair. Allura finds her side of the table and gestures the rest of you.
Matt: "Please, have a seat."
Orion: I stand. I don't sit.
Matt: All right.
Matt: The overeign finishes writing some papers, rolls them up, snaps twice, and a gentleman comes by. He hands him the papers and says,
Matt: "Get this to Lady and Lord Briarwood as soon as possible, thank you."
Matt: "All right. First of all, I want to welcome you all back. It's been a few weeks since we've seen each other. I've been recently given word that you unceremoniously appeared in the center of the Lyceum not but twelve hours ago, worse for wear. So I would like to know, first off, why you've returned in the center of our city. And I want to see how you've all been these past few weeks. I apologize if I'm a bit scattered I’ve had a few things on my mind as of late. But yes, how is Vox Machina."
Liam: If I may. We didn't choose to dump ourselves right in the middle of the city. That was born out of necessity, not out of choice. The task we set out to finish proved a lot more complicated than originally perceived. Frankly, I worry about the safety of the city of Kraghammer. Underneath their home down in the bowels of the earth, I'm don't know how much the council knows about the race of the illithid. We stumbled into a veritable hornets' nest of them below the city.
Matt: Most faces are blank. Allura has her hands on the table, listening intently. As you say illithid, you do notice that Seeker Asum Emring, the halfling, immediately sits back in his chair with a look of 'oh, snap'.
Liam: I see a lot of blank stares at this table. I wasn't very familiar with them either. There is an entire city in the underdark beneath Kraghammer. And... ... in their midst was a beholder that was controlling the entire city. We ended up destroying it, barely escaping with our lives. Fleeing the city... destroying a god? I think.
Laura: I don't think we destroyed the god.
Orion: The beholder is merely a demi-demon.
Laura: Yes, it was something he had possessed, but the god still lives.
Liam: Yes, but Orcus was behind the beholder.
Marisha: We just have the horn.
Liam: We killed K'varn and then he got back up again. He didn't get himself back up.
Marisha: Because Orcus is a god of necromancy and undeath.
Orion: That's what the horn did. It brought him back to life when he would die. That's why I ripped it out when we did it because I knew that's what was going on. That's what the horn does.
Liam: I just worry that it's not just an appliance. It's got hidden in it something --
Orion: It absolutely has -- Remember, it laughed at me when I tried to crush it --
Liam: --is what I'm saying.
Matt: Allura looks at you strangely.
Matt: "Tiberius, you sound different."
Orion: I was talking to --
Matt: I know.
Liam: Be that as it may we riled up a city of --
Taliesin: Mind flayers.
Liam: Buttholes as Tiberius would call them. -- very unhappy race of things below the surface of the earth. Now, we're here today because Tiberius, crafty as he is, was able to flee ahead of us and create a portal back here. We ended up falling ass over tea kettle in the Lyceum, so here we are.
Matt: "Well, welcome back."
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: "It's glad to see you're safe."
Liam: We've brought a little bit of the evil with us.
Matt: At which point the table gets extremely uncomfortable, suddenly. As everyone steps back, Kima steps forward. She's kept to the back at this point, and says,
Matt: "It's all right. I will speak for this group as you also know of their exploits and their abilities. They saved me from what was probably certain death and torture and aided me in stopping what darkness was beneath Kraghammer. At least what we could. But, listen to what they have to say and understand they are as trustworthy as they come."
Matt: At which point the sovereign lifts a hand up to her and says,
Matt: "Well Kima, your word is trusted and I appreciate you also have returned to us healthy. So. What is this evil you bring with you?"
Liam: We have it stored safely away.
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: But this beholder... ... was using an artifact, a horn. Emanating darkness and shit. And Tiberius, in the heat of the battle, ripped it from its pate. And we brought it back with us.
Marisha: It is one of the two horns of Orcus.
Matt: At that notification, you say the name Orcus, and you can see there's a whole energy shift in the room at which point. A lot of furrowed brows drop to intense. The actual air of the room seems to go still for a moment. From what you can see, Seeker Asum and Tofor both grit their teeth and lean forward as you say this. Tofor says, Tofor: "You said Orcus?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Orion: Are you deaf?
Marisha: Tiberius.
Taliesin: Manners.
Liam: We see the apprehension written on your faces and we are nervous as well. But the alternative was leaving the horn with these illithid. Hundreds if not thousands of illithid. We had to make a judgement call rather quickly, and... ... frankly leaving it there with them seemed like it wasn't an option. Tofor: "You've done right in bringing it here. This has to be destroyed. Sent as far away-- If this is indeed an artifact of Orcus, it cannot exist on this plane."
Taliesin: Plans must be drawn up.
Marisha: That's kind of what we thought.
Orion: Yes we knew this already.
Matt: At which point Kima steps forward and says
Matt: "Now, understand this is not something you can lock in a box, or put some guards around it. There was a reason this was forgotten and needs to be again. With the proper surrounding strength and formidable individuals, I can take it to the grand chantry in Osthania where the High Paladin Archibald will reseal it. Far away from the eyes and minds of the world. Lest we can come up with some sort of way to destroy this item."
Matt: At which point the Arbiter, Braum, steps forward. Arbiter Braum: "If you think there's possibly a way to destroy this, we need to discover this here. We cannot allow it outside of the midst of this, to some chaotic winds and whim of the world around us. We have the walls of Emon to keep it safe. Why not take it to the Lyceum."
Liam: I want to make an insight check on the whole table.
Travis: Dang.
Taliesin: I want to also double-check, who was it that handed off the letter to the Briarwoods?
Matt: That was the sovereign.
Taliesin: Sovereign? Thank you.
Matt: So which individual, the Arbiter?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, Arbiter Braum. What'd you roll?
Liam: Just a ten.
Matt: Ten?
Ashley: Can I insight the seeker?
Matt: Sure.
Matt: What's your insight roll?
Ashley: Thirteen.
Matt: Thirteen? Okay.
Taliesin: I would like to insight the sovereign just because, reasons.
Ashley: Yeah, we do.
Taliesin: One.
Matt: Starting the game off strong guys.
Laura: I think you need some Florida rolling.
Taliesin: I'm just an idiot thinking.
Laura: I think you need some Florida rolling.
Liam: Yeah, I think so too. You're awfully quiet.
Laura: I'm going to insight check as well!
Laura: Because Matt can totally whisper to me if I get this good.
Liam: He'll text you.
Matt: I'll text it to you.
Liam: Roll high.
Laura: Hold on, I'm looking.
Travis: She's rolling.
Laura: Seventeen.
Matt: Eleventeen?
Travis: Seventeen!
Laura: Seventeen!
Matt: A total of 17?
Liam: Eleventy-seven.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: On which individual?
Liam: Which person at the table, sis?
Laura: You.
Liam: Your brother?
Laura: Oh no! On the deep voiced guy!
Ashley: The Arbiter.
Matt: Okay. Arbiter Braum.
Laura: Yes, the arbiter. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: You!
Liam: Why you gotta be like that, huh?
Matt: I'll say in a general feel about the room, but the arbiter specifically, There is definitely a very quick rising in tension, fear, and adrenaline in the room at this conversation. Fear is the main thing you're getting. I wouldn't say that you sense any deception. You just sense that the stakes have just suddenly jumped from what they were expecting their morning to be. They're trying to wrap their head around it. So nothing too particular catches your shit radar.
Laura: All right.
Travis: We are not leaving the horn here.
Laura: No..
Taliesin: We would have to leave you here.
Matt: As Grog speaks up for the Arbiter, he says, Arbiter Braum: "I'm not saying we leave it here. I'm saying that while we have it here, we have it studied. Bring it to the Lyceum. The headmaster and his entire research facility could possibly find a way to destroy it. There is no finer arcane focus than that lyceum in the city. They're responsible for the construction of our sky ships. And the crystals that keep them elevated."
Orion: I love skyships.
Laura: I believe the power would be too great. It will corrupt. People will want to take it for themselves. Arbiter Braum: "Then it has to be taken elsewhere and sealed. Like Kima was requesting."
Marisha: So you're saying essentially our two options are we can either keep it here and study it to try and figure out a way to destroy it and have all of the risks of this horn being inside the city or we take the other massive risks of trying to ship it off somewhere and hope that it gets sealed away?
Matt: At which point, Tofor the female dragonborn sits up in her chair and says, Tofor: "Regardless. It should not stay here in my opinion. Understand the longer it resides within Emon, the more word will spread. And more despots will be drawn to our city to claim it. Do you wish to have all the darkness of this land slowly swarm in on the city?"
Liam: I think we're of a like mind.
Orion: Yes.
Liam: I think we should take it from the city.
Marisha: I think it's a giant target on our backs right now.
Orion: I turn to the Arbiter.
Orion: There is something that you should know. During our battle with K'varn, which was the name of the beholder, which the horn resided upon its head. When I ripped it from its head, I held it in the telekinesis state. I attempted to crush it for not knowing what it was at first. Just knowing it was bringing creatures back to life. When I attempted to do so, I heard somewhat of a laughter in the back of my mind. I fear whatever this is attached to might be aware, or if anything, more aware than it was previously. I'm not sure if it was alerted by being placed on the beholder's head to begin with, but I heard something.
Orion: Looking at Tofor.
Orion: I agree with the peasant. That we should get it out of here immediately.
Matt: At which point the sovereign who's been kinda quiet this moment, says,
Matt: "Well. Best I can tell at this point, it should not stay in Emon. We've had enough trouble in this city and enough issues here that we're having to deal with in the aftermath of the attack on my family. We do not have the mental will nor the ability to withstand any sort of assault either from the inside or the outside of the city. If we are to take it elsewhere I trust the opinion of you, of Kima, and Allura."
Matt: At which point Allura takes a moment and says,
Matt: "Just the knowledge of such a thing existing, let alone two, in this world is dangerous. Who knows what horrors an individual could achieve should they find both horns. Now, wherever this gets taken, the knowledge that all of us know that these exist now, and anyone else beyond this, means that that's a leak. That's a weakness. Now I've heard of some magics that can erase selective memories permanently. Ancient magics."
Matt: At which point as she starts saying this, the rest of the room shifts uncomfortably. You can see Tofor begins to raise her hand to protest. Allura shuts her down and says,
Matt: "But, I'd not employ these unless they were absolutely necessary. I need to speak with the Arcana Pentsafocal and see if this is such a strange and necessary circumstance to allow the use of such magics. That will take me some time to get the entire conclave to agree, but I think it's possible. It may be the only way, if we can not destroy this, to make sure that the rest of this world never knows that it existed. I think that's the safest route. As for getting it out of the city I feel that we have two individuals here, two followers of Bahamut, both the deity that saw the deity, brought the vision to Kima, and presented, whether in a roundabout way, the power and strength of these individuals to eventually retrieve it and prevent it from being an artifact that instrumentally destroyed the dwarven city and quite possibly all of Tal'Dorei. So I think if there was a god whose guidance we can look into, I would put my trust in the clergy of Bahamut."
Matt: She looks to Kima. Kima nods her head.
Orion: Of course we'd agree with such sentiments as well.
Matt: Kima raises her maul and says,
Matt: Well then, if that's to be the case, "I'll send word over to the rest of my temple. We'll send over our finest paladins, clerics, and guardians. Prepare a box for travel. We'll take it across the sea. Then we shall seal this bastard."
Orion: Kima.
Travis: Yeah! Oh. Sorry. (all laugh)
Orion: Kima, when you do approach your king, propose because Orcus's horn is pure black evil, perhaps the side of light can help as well. The blessing of Sarenrae and other light sources, divine powers, could be helpful as well.
Matt: "The horn will remain here until the vessel is brought over. But we have holy vessels specifically designed for the keeping of remains or things that are of great evil. We would gladly welcome the blessing of something from Sarenrae as well. After all, there is nothing wrong with more positive energy instilled to maintain such a negative force."
Marisha: I personally don't trust this horn travelling anywhere without at least one of our supervision.
Matt: At which point the sovereign speaks up and says,
Matt: "And to be completely honest, we are very grateful you've brought the horn here. But you are a motley crew. Who is to say any of you are also immune to this corruption as well? Who's to say you eight carry the mental willpower to withstand this darkness any better than a group of paladins designed and trained their entire lives to withstand and destroy this evil. What assurance do I have that your attachment to nature will not become some dark, brambled, twisted, thing in the proximity of this artifact? None. Just keep that in mind."
Orion: I look to the group and do this to Scanlan. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Taking quite advantage of his current state of mind.
Orion: You have no idea what I'm going to do for the rest of this game.
Travis: You literally do that to Scanlan. Like you... to Scanlan?
Orion: No, I was pointing at him.
Liam: Right in the ear.
Matt: Wet willy. To our little gnome bard.
Orion: (laughs)
Matt: We miss you Sam.
Matt: Uriel looks around.
Matt: "Well, given the circumstance I would say that our best bet now is to have Kima and Tofor reach out to the grand chambers of Bahamut. Have them bring a vessel and seal it somewhere that they find fit for an object of this dark presence. Is the council in agreement of this? Unless some other, better means arises. How long will it take for this vessel to arrive?"
Matt: At which point, Kima scratches her chin for a second.
Matt: "By the fastest ships, especially if we're using some of your fancy sky dinghies. I can't imagine more than two weeks?"
Marisha: Two weeks?!
Matt: At which point --
Orion: That's 14 days, your highness.
Marisha: (sighs)
Laura: That was adorable.
Ashley: A fortnight?
Matt: At which point Allura stands forward and says,
Matt: "It's in the means of --"
Marisha: You guys don't have any holy ships here. You don't have like a ship dock?
Orion: I'm sure if they did they would probably use that one.
Taliesin: But I'm using it. (all laugh)
Matt: At this point Allura sits forward and to the rest of the group, says,
Matt: "To be fair Kima, in my experience and knowledge, ships function well for the movement of goods and large objects. The speed of this requires some expediting and I happen to have a friend who is over in Osthania, probably not far from your clergy. Perhaps we can facilitate a two-day travel?"
Matt: At which point the group leans back for a second and Kima goes,
Matt: "Well fine. Yeah, I guess."
Matt: Shoots a dirty look a little bit to --
Marisha: Can I do an insight check on Allura really quick?
Matt: Sure.
Liam: She's saying a ship will be ready in two days or take two days to travel?
Matt: Allura's saying,
Matt: "Depending on the size of this vessel, why do we even need a ship? We have the ability to transport between the cities. If we can pool our resources, there's no reason why we can't bring them here nearly instantaneously."
Marisha: Thirteen.
Matt: Thirteen? Best you can tell, Allura's really hard to read. She keeps up her smile but she definitely has her intense face on. She's deep in the moment. No real gives one way or the other. The rest of the group looks around and Arcanist in the silence goes,
Matt: "Well then, I think that me and Kima and Tofor, if you'd like, we can designate a way of bringing this relic container as fast as possible so we can get this going. I wish not to keep this within our presence much longer. Do we agree to that?"
Orion: Yes.
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: I think we would feel comfortable going along for the ride and seeing this thing through to the end.
Matt: She glances over to the sovereign. The sovereign nods.
Matt: "Very well. Very well, I'll allow it. I may have some business for you coming soon so try not to be gone too long. Although this is much more important business, I do agree."
Matt: Then he gives a laugh and smile to raise a bit of levity in the room that nobody seems to respond to.
Matt: "But nevertheless if you wish to travel and see this through I don't see there would be any complaint."
Matt: He looks to Lady Kima and Kima says,
Matt: "No, not at all. We've gotten along swimmingly so far. Mostly. Very well. I'm bad at this political stuff."
Matt: Kima steps back a little bit, Kima: "I defer to the rest of you."
Matt: Puts her maul on the ground and awkwardly looks away. The sovereign goes,
Matt: "Very well. It is settled. Reach out to your clergy. Bring the vessel. Allura, facilitate its arrival. We will get this artifact as far away from Emon as possible. This is adjourned. Thank you all very much for coming to this council meeting."
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to catch the sovereign on his way out.
Matt: All right. At which point everyone gathers the rest of their papers, their parchments, they're rolling up scrolls. The Arbiter gets up and lumbers his way out of the room. The seeker, Asum, steps up to the rest of you with a final handshake.
Matt: "A pleasure to meet you all, once again, I've heard so much. You're doing fine work."
Matt: He seems strangely nervous. But in a weird way, he's a gentle hint of fanboy.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: I wink at him. (all laugh)
Matt: He slyly winks back on his way out.
Matt: As he exits, Tofor stands up. You've only seen her sitting since you arrived. As Tofor stands in her female dragonborn form, she is probably a good solid foot taller than Tiberius. And is a thick musclebound dragonborn paladin of Bahamut. Her armor shifts as she stands, she begins to make her way towards the door, not even with a glance in your direction.
Orion: That means she's as tall as you, Grog.
Travis: What?
Orion: She's as tall as you.
Marisha: I just whisper to Tiberius and say,
Marisha: Are all the ladies that big in Draconia?
Orion: It all depends. Not really.
Matt: She's bigger than usual.
Orion: She's a wretched peasant so I can not.
Marisha: That's so mean.
Liam: That's a little harsh.
Matt: Allura stands up and begins to leave. The sovereign stands up and as he stands up the guards come out and they come to his side.
Taliesin: Good Sovereign, if I can have a moment? Did I hear correctly that Lord and Lady Briarwood were in town?
Matt: "They were but a week ago."
Taliesin: They were but a week ago? And they've left, have they?
Matt: "Yes. Do you know of Lord and Lady Briarwood?"
Taliesin: Just in passing. Did they have business in town? Was there something in particular? I'm just curious. It doesn't really matter. I mean it does matter but not particularly.
Matt: "It was relatively routine, we're establishing an official trade route through the northeast. Spanning the Boreal Plane to Whitestone."
Taliesin: Oh.
Matt: "They inherited the region after the unfortunate demise of the Derolo family."
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "However our ambassador has noted that they've rebuilt rather well and honored the memory of the family and they're really committed to reestablishing the foothold of Whitestone in the north. So they came here on a diplomatic mission to open trade."
Taliesin: That's nice. I would love to. Please, keep it quiet, but if I could be notified if they're coming through again. I would like very much to surprise them, if that would be possible.
Orion: Am I standing next to Percy? Am I hearing this?
Matt: Yes.
Orion: Good.
Taliesin: It's just old business. It would be very interesting to see them again.
Matt: For the sake of this conversation, I'm going to ask you to roll a deception check.
Taliesin: Okay. Natural 20.
Marisha: (cheers)
Orion: (claps)
Marisha: On the new pretty die.
Taliesin: Don't fuck with me.
Matt: The Sovereign gives you a look and says,
Matt: "Certainly. Very well, I will notify you should they come through again."
Taliesin: Deeply honored by your thought, sir. Thank you.
Orion: At the end of this conversation I'm going to rip off a piece of the scroll of telescription and I'm going to approach.
Orion: When you do, all you do is write the message to this and we will receive it. It's an enchanted parchment. I will receive the message.
Matt: He tells you,
Matt: "I know how these work. Yes, thank you."
Matt: As you present it, he walks by and one of his guards takes it from you and gives you a nod.
Matt: They exit the chambers. You guys are escorted out into the main hallway of the palace.
Ashley: Bye!
Matt: The rest of the council
Matt: The rest of the council scatters amongst the palace proper. You are all left. The doors close behind you and the echoing hallways towards the central left side of the palace.
Taliesin: (sighs)
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Ashley: Are you okay?
Marisha: You're sweating.
Taliesin: I know.
Ashley: Are you okay?
Marisha: Why are you sweating?
Taliesin: It's hot.
Marisha: What happened?
Taliesin: Nothing. The sun comes up and it gets very hot. I'll tell you later.
Orion: Very good.
Taliesin: This is discussion for later. There's more important things.
Matt: Kima and Allura are near you. At which point, Kima looks at the rest of you and says,
Matt: "I apologize, I have to figure this out now. So I'm going to head to the nearest temple of Bahamut and see if we could reach out quickly."
Marisha: What should we do?
Matt: That's up to you.
Matt: She looks to Allura, questioning Allura.
Matt: "In the event of this blessed chamber arriving, you will be notified. We will request your presence to bring the artifact in question, seal it, and then we will begin our journey over to its place of hopeful destruction and/or proper banishment."
Ashley: Would you like anyone to go with you or you just want to go alone?
Matt: "To?"
Ashley: To work out the details of all of this?
Matt: Allura says,
Matt: "For me, it's just preparation of the arcane transference ritual. I'm going to go meet with a friend of mine over in Ostania."
Taliesin: I will say we haven't replenished our potions yet. And we could go --
Ashley: Should we go to visit our old friend?
Marisha: Gilmore?
Taliesin: We could go to Gilmore's.
Marisha: Gilmore?
Ashley: Gilmore?
Taliesin: We could go to Gilmore's.
Ashley: Gilmore's Glorious Goods?
Marisha: You essentially want us to wait?
Matt: "Whatever business you need to get done. It should take no more than two days to get this taken care of."
Marisha: You guys, we have a weekend! (all laugh)
Liam: This is Allura and Kima who are here?
Matt: Yeah, they're the only two who have stayed behind with you guys outside of the council chambers.
Liam: I take Pike by the hand and I walk over to Kima. And they're short so I kneel down. I say to the both of them.
Liam: I've never pretended to be a man of the cloth, I know little of the gods. But the brush we had down below has left me shaken. What can the gods tell us? The gods stick their noses into our doings whenever it pleases them. Are they not here? Have they anything to say for what is happening now?
Marisha: I'm with this guy! High five Vax.
Matt: At which point-- did you wish to respond in any way?
Ashley: Well, I just know that I tried to have a response from my god down below and she didn't really respond the way I would have liked for her to. But maybe things will be different. What were you going to say?
Matt: At which point Kima looks to you, at what you just said with curious worry.
Matt: "Well, if what you say is your faith has been shaken, there is always room at the temple of Bahamut to find redemption, strength, and guidance. You realize the platinum --"
Marisha: She's trying to get you to come to her church.
Matt: (laughs)
Ashley: She's trying to convert.
Marisha: She's trying to convert! Get the leaflet.
Matt: "The platinum dragon has guided much of civilization's growth, expansion, and survival for thousands of years. The eternal battle between him and the darkness that is Tiamat and the chaos beyond that --"
Marisha: With all due respect, Kima, I don't think that was Vax's question.
Matt: "To get to the point, I apologize. The gods are many and the gods have been at war for as long as we exist. There are some that believe we are nothing but the aftermath of their squabbles. But nevertheless, there is much good in this world that guides us to our ultimate destiny. And if you yourself ever feel that you are lost amongst this chaos, don't ever be afraid to stop in and ask a few questions."
Liam: I was just wondering if I could ask you to ask them, to maybe help. I would never think to ask the gods for help if I wanted a shiny new sword or pile of riches, but this is something different.
Travis: Unless they could get us a pile of riches.
Laura: Or a shining sword.
Liam: Good boy. (all laugh)
Matt: At which point Kima laughs to herself.
Matt: "There are benefits to being of the order."
Matt: Kima who does not have an accent and did not say it that way. Too many NPCs in my head right now. She says,
Matt: "But, understand. Whenever I felt lost, which was often. It's good to have that guiding warmth to turn to. And sometimes it brings you into a subterranean mountain being tortured by dwarves. Sometimes it guides you to new friends and allies. Strange the way the gods work. But, when you put your all into it, they've kept me alive so far."
Ashley: That's a really good point. I guess that's a positive way to look at it.
Marisha: I really like long walks in the forest when I'm feeling disconnected.
Ashley: That works too, you know.
Travis: Lady Kima, do the gods allow you to have relationships?
Matt: Kima, you ask this and she gives you a look of confusion, and then… She already a darker complexion for a halfling but her cheeks grow noticeably ruddier. She averts her gaze and says,
Matt: "Well..."
Travis: I start trying to do my best Vax wink.
Laura: I'm Vex.
Travis: --Vex wink. (all laugh)
Matt: She averts her gaze and goes,
Matt: "Well, as far as I know it is not a vow of chastity within the order."
Travis: So you're saying there's a chance.
Matt: She still is looking away. She looks away and looks to the rest of you. Looks to Allura. Looks to you again. And then goes,
Matt: "I really have to get to work on this."
Taliesin: You did this.
Matt: "I really have to get to work on this."
Matt: She leaves the group and continues down the hallway. Quick steps.
Ashley: Bye, Kima! Quick steps.
Liam: A lot of math involved in that equation.
Marisha: Yeah...
Matt: Allura chuckles to herself and steps into the place where she was and goes,
Orion: I care not to solve the puzzle.
Matt: "Oh, as a note. Be careful who you ask those questions to, you may get an earful."
Matt: And Allura smiles and motions towards Kima.
Matt: "Don't get me wrong, you're more than welcome to explore as you like, but that's a rabbit hole my friend."
Travis: A rabbit hole, is that what we're calling it these days?
Matt: You feel a gentle slap from some unknown arcane force across your cheek Grog. And Allura gives you a stern glare.
Marisha: Oh, don't talk about her girl that way.
Liam: Don't make me take my earrings off.
Matt: Anyway.
Matt: "So two days. We'll call for you when the item is to be transferred and properly brought to its destination. In the meantime, prepare as you see fit, enjoy this well-earned rest, and we'll take it from there. I have much travel to do myself. See you all very soon."
Matt: She begins to step up the hallway. As she steps up the hallway, you can see there's a light yellowish glow about her form. Then with a sudden flash of white light, Allura's just gone.
Marisha: So guys. I'm thinking we take a local tour of all the historical highlights of Emon. We've never really gone sightseeing, Then maybe we can catch a nice dinner in the city tonight.
Laura: Oh, look at the time.
Travis: Oh, it's getting so late.
Marisha: It's 1pm. We've got the whole day
Taliesin: It feels like eight. It really feels so late.
Marisha: I picked up one of these pamphlets while we were in the palace and apparently there's a nice natural history museum.
Taliesin: Gilmore's? Gilmore's?
Orion: Your highness, what is a pam-phlet?
Taliesin: Gilmore's?
Orion: Oh, a lot of paper.
Taliesin: I'll be at Gilmore's.
Orion: Oh, it's like a mini book!
Marisha: It's like a tiny scroll.
Orion: It has pictures!
Marisha: Yes!
Orion: Look, Percy!
Taliesin: I'm already heading towards Gilmore's.
Liam: I'm following Percy.
Travis: We're going to Gilmore's, too.
Matt: All right. You guys exit and find your way, exiting the palace and the cloudtop district to make your way to Abedar's Promenade to enter and reunite with your good friend Gilmore.
Matt: We're going to take this moment to take a break, use the restroom, get some food.
Taliesin: We're at two? Are we at two more?
Zac: Giveaway time!
Matt: Oh, it's giveaway time. (Background: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord) All right, we hit our next giveaway so we'll do that first. All right, we hit our next giveaway so we'll do that first. (Background: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord) All right, so we have --
Matt: Oh no.
Marisha: Snuggle Lord?!
Marisha: It's a Snuggle Lord variant!
Taliesin: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord.
Liam: There he is. (all cheer)
Marisha: Snuggle Lord has returned!
Matt: There you go, there is Snuggle Lord in his glory.
Marisha: No, not the horns of Orcus!
Orion: No, now he has the power! (all laugh)
Zac: We hit our second giveaway. (all cheer)
Zac: We're going to give one of these away. All you have to do is be active in the chat room, guys. So, if you're watching full screen, get out of full screen, be active. She can't see it, can she?
Matt: No, she can see it though.
Marisha: Can't see.
Marisha: Can you see it? Gotta tilt it down a bit.
Laura: There we go, it's so cute.
Zac: All right guys be active in the chat room. We're going to let these guys take a break. When we come back from the break, we'll announce the winner.
Marisha: Do we have a word?
Zac: Oh yeah, go for it.
Marisha: Here we'll use the word KommissarProps in the chat room.
Zac: I'll have to go set it up. Okay, I gotta run.
Matt: Go set it up. So hold that thought, until he starts it. The word will be KommissarProps.
Marisha: Say KommissarProps and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook
Matt: These horns will be yours. and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook because he was awesome enough to make these horns for us. So Instagram and Facebook, that's where all the pretty pictures are.
Matt: You yourself can be corrupted by the evil of Orcus.
Marisha: You yourself can be corrupted if you go and find him.
Taliesin: Watch him while he sleeps.
Matt: You and RhymesWithOrange can be the two keepers of the two horns of Orcus and bring ruin to the entire world of Exandria. So that could be you. Anyway, we're taking a break. We'll see you guys back here in a little over ten minutes and we'll continue as they head towards… Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Taliesin: Gilmore's!
Matt: All right, I gotta prepare. See you soon guys.
Matt: Hey guys, welcome back. We’re about to get in some game time again here in a second, but first we have our second winner to win the second horn of Orcus for the evening’s giveaway. We’re really excited to announce the winner of the second player’s handbook signed by the group, the dice kit, as well as this horn, is Ember72.
Matt: Ember72, congratulations.
Travis: Ember72!
Matt: You get to have this one. It’s awesome, really stoked. We now have both of these horns given away. And while these are the only horns of Orcus that’ll be out there, our fantastic propmaster over here, Kai, Kommissar Props, will be working with us in the future to do more Critical Role-based prop giveaways. And once again, definitely check out his work, he’s an amazing fabricator and propmaster.
Ashley: Those are the only two? he’s an amazing fabricator and propmaster.
Matt: These are the only two that’re gonna go out.
Taliesin: They’re the only two in the world.
Ashley: That’s really special.
Taliesin: They’re the only two in the world.
Zac: At 3600 we’ll do the starter kit, t-shirt --
Ashley: That sounded insincere, but I really meant it.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: That did sound insincere.
Matt: We’ll see somewhere down the road. If we want to put out more stuff, we’ll see. But right now these are just an exclusive giveaway. Excited for those two guys. So everyone once again for Rhymeswithorange and Ember72, congratulations on those bits.
Marisha: Or maybe if you follow Kommissar Props, we’ll do another giveaway to the people who follow him.
Matt: Helping friends out because they do awesome work. Congratulations on that. If we can get to 3600 we’re gonna be doing some dance after the show, so hopefully we can hit that subscriber number tonight.
Zac: Plus giveaway.
Matt: Plus giveaway. Plus the signed t-shirt, the dice box, starter kit, so.
Matt: Good stuff. All right, bringing us back to the game.
Ashley: Gilmore!
Matt: So you guys, you make your way outside of the Castletop District into the center of Emon proper. Returning to Abedar’s Promenade, which is the largest central section of the city, where most of the merchantile itself seems to have gathered and been a serious conglomerate where all business in this city happens. Those who would like a quick little visual idea of the city, this is Emon.
Matt: Right there. It’s a small little -- --there is an amazing printout of this that they’ve, actually Laura and Travis, have framed and put up in their room sometime. We’ll have to go ahead and bring on the show and show you guys.
Laura: We’re gonna bring it to put on the set. At some point.
Matt: Yeah, we’ll have it too. Anyway, the Castletop District is here, the inner portion. You guys have made your way out south to the Central District and then towards Abedar’s Promenade, which is right over here. So you guys would’ve gone this way, actually. So you’re out to Abedar’s Promenade in the far eastern side of Emon, where you eventually find your way to the outskirts of your favorite purveyor of arcane mystical artifacts.
Marisha: Gilmore!
Matt: Shaun Gilmore himself.
Marisha: Shaun Gilmore.
Matt: So as you guys --
Ashley: Is that his first name?
Marisha: I didn’t know Shaun was his first name either.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I didn’t know Shaun was his first name either.
Taliesin: You’ve not been paying attention.
Matt: Shaun Gilmore, but you’ve always called him Gilmore.
Marisha: We’re on a first-name basis now, guys.
Matt: No one’s on a first-name basis with Gilmore.
Marisha: We are.
Matt: Gilmore is Gilmore.
Marisha: Except for maybe Vax over there.
Matt: Except for maybe, maybe Vax.
Matt: So at this point now you’re pushing about two in the afternoon. It’s extremely busy, you can hear the clopping of horse hooves on the ground, people are walking past. You’d swear as you’re stepping through the city, maybe a handful of people tend to stop and watch you guys walk through, stunned. Almost like they’d seen a celebrity on the street, as the most recent makeup of the Winter’s Crest festival was a celebration of you being the heroes who saved the city of Emon and the sovereign and his family. Apparently you are now recognizable within the city of Emon.
Liam: My sister winks.
Travis: Yeah we are.
Matt: All right, so Vax wills Vex to wink. Vex, do you accept this wink from your brother?
Laura: I do.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Other way.
Matt: Perfect, there you go.
Laura: Just a little more.
Matt: Perfect. We’ve lined it up. As you walk across the main thoroughfare, you make your way to the wide but single-story building that is Gilmore’s Glorious Goods. Of all the various shades of brown and red and brick that makes up all these buildings, Gilmore’s Glorious Goods is presented in fine, deep blue and purple fabric and a paint scheme that would look like the worst funhouse to enter. Worst or best, depending on your opinion. The entranceway is not a door but a series of hanging beads and large cloth drapes that are gently falling to be brushed aside as you enter. It’s not as big as you remember, or recall, seemingly. But as you step through the front door you remember why. Much like the TARDIS, the interior of Gilmore’s Goods is bigger on the inside. There is a magical enchantment based within this building where the interior is actually a two-story and much larger place of business. Immediately the smells of incense and fine perfumes assault your nose --
Travis: Ugh! fine perfumes assault your nose --
Matt: Like a terrible medieval Sephora.
Liam: Like coming home.
Ashley: Medieval Sephora.
Matt: A series of magically flickering ever-burning candles adorn sconces along the walls. You can see there are glass cases set out in the center of the room, there is the long wooden bar on the far end which has itself its own beaded curtain that is closed, and there are three employees of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods in their ceremonial blue and purple robes that match the exterior, staring about while there a number of other possible customers that are looking about. There are numerous bookshelves along the walls. You can see there is, next to the stairway on the far left side of this floor, there is an herbalist who specializes in dried herbs and sales in that regard. You haven't been to the upstairs yet in this complex. But you now are standing back in the comfortable, although slightly offensive to your senses, interior of Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Liam: I'm scanning the entire store for him. I want to find him.
Matt: He's not currently visible.
Liam: Oh! He's not here?
Matt: He's not visible. Not in the main room.
Liam: All right.
Ashley: He has his private office.
Laura: Brother.
Ashley: He has his private office.
Liam: Yes?
Laura: You should get that evil Clarota helmet checked out and see what all good it does us.
Liam: What, this one?
Laura: Yep. That one.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: Vax.
Liam: Yes?
Marisha: I say you'd be the point man here.
Liam: I think so.
Orion: I would agree.
Ashley: I think that's a really good plan.
Taliesin: I second that notion. Quintuple it.
Marisha: Yeah. The twinsies should go.
Liam: Start looking around. Start shopping. Don't pay for anything yet, because I have an arrangement.
Ashley: He can get a little discount.
Laura: He can get a little wink, wink, nudge, nudge discount.
Marisha: I go up to Vax. I put my hands on his shoulders, and I say,
Marisha: You got this.
Marisha: And I cast Enhance Ability on him.
Ashley: Yeah.
Marisha: For charisma? I'm assuming?
Liam: Let's make my hair even glossier than it already is.
Marisha: And I give him a little bit of the dad thumb.
Liam: I know that thumb.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: The dad thumb?
Marisha: Wipe the morning breakfast off of him before I send him on to school.
Matt: (laughs quietly)
Marisha: And I give him a little love tap on his behind and send him on his way.
Ashley: Send him on his merry way.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Shoulder massage.
Matt: All righty. So?
Marisha: So you have advantage rolls on all charisma rolls.
Liam: Is there a front desk?
Orion: (package crinkling)
Liam: Is there a front desk?
Matt: On the far back side, there is a very long, well-crafted dark wood desk that is adorned with what looks like small alchemical components, (package crinkling) with what looks like small alchemical components, glass tubing and -- (package crinkling) Be a little louder with those Red Vines.
Orion: Sorry. Do you want one?
Matt: I'm good, thank you.
Ashley: (laughs)
Matt: We're good. You can see there are a number of glass containers and small corked vials --
Liam: I'm sorry, he's looking for Gilmore.
Marisha: (laughs)
Liam: They're going to flirt together.
Matt: (laughs)
Orion: It's like watching a movie.
Marisha: (giggles)
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: It's all right. There are some books stacked up. There is a small, embedded glass case that seems to have a couple of items that are under a purplish-maroon, velvet piece of material that's currently covering them. There is that beaded curtain with strips of material that block the back room.
Liam: Okay, and there's a person manning the --
Matt: No, not currently. It is just an empty desk.
Liam: Is there a bell or anything?
Matt: There is a bell.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: As you hit the bell, one of the employees who is helping somebody looks around and goes,
Matt: "I'm sorry."
Matt: What you see is a half-elven woman with thick spectacles who is currently stepping over to try and stop you. However, the beaded curtain swishes open with the grandiose gesture of one slightly meaty hand. Stepping out in his fine, gold-trimmed, purple robes, his longish thick, black, coarse hair pulled into a nice ponytail. Smoothly-shaved face with a slight hint of a braided goatee that dangles about three inches from his chin.
Liam: Will you remind me because it's been a while. Gilmore's a good-looking man, though, isn't he?
Matt: Yeah. He's handsome.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Is the braid new? Is that a new addition?
Laura: He's so handsome, Vax.
Marisha: The braid's new. He decided to rock the braid. Go for it!
Matt: Gilmore's a very handsome gentleman. I would say he's not fit and muscular. He is a handsome, comfortably jovial gentleman.
Liam: I'm picturing Jeremy Irons in a wizard robe.
Matt: Kind of. Imagine him with a little more paunch.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: But very charismatic. Open chest to his vest, with a number of gold chains and medallions that dangle around.
Liam: I feel you.
Matt: It's almost like a wizard's track suit. (all laugh)
Liam: You ruined it for me, man!
Taliesin: And it's dead.
Marisha: Please tell me it says "arcane" on the butt?
Matt: No. (all laugh)
Matt: He's very well-dressed, but his presentation is definitely a presentation. As the hand swishes open, he goes,
Matt: "I'm sorry, was I being summoned?"
Orion: Yes.
Matt: He immediately looks and goes,
Matt: "Oh. You've returned."
Liam: Gilmore, you glorious bastard. How have you been?
Matt: He immediately rushes to the edge and leans over the counter to give you a grandiose hug and actually lifts you off your feet. Much stronger than you anticipated. He goes,
Matt: "Oh, Vax'ahlia. It's been far too long."
Matt: He sets you down next to him behind the counter and gives you a big hug, his strong wizard arms around you. A scent of what's almost like fine herbs with a hint of patchouli enters your nose.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Liam: You naughty man. You just called me by my sister's name. That is going to cost you.
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: "I said Vax! What do you mean?"
Liam: I heard "Vex'ahlia." That's ridiculous. Preposterous. Can we go to the videotape? Anyone?
Marisha: Instant replay!
Orion: Actually, Vax, he was correct. He said your name correctly. I believe you owe him a little something now.
Marisha: I think it was a little bit of combination. A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. I think he called you Vex'ahlia.
Liam: Water under the bridge.
Marisha: Or Vax'ahlia, is what he called you.
Orion: He called you Vax'ahlia, which I call you in my sleep.
Liam: Shut up, you.
Liam: I lean in.
Matt: He looks genuinely perturbed and embarrassed by the whole circumstance.
Matt: "I --"
Liam: I lean in. I pat him on the hand.
Liam: Don't you worry. We have come from far and away. You would not believe the shit we have been through, but I don't want to talk about me. I want to talk about you. What has been going on in this city since we've been gone?
Matt: "Well."
Matt: And he looks about the rest of you and says,
Matt: "Obviously you've brought the rest of your friends here. Come, sit! Story time, story time!" (all laugh)
Matt: "Please sit around."
Orion: Fantastic.
Matt: "We have been doing marvelously. Trade has opened up wide in Emon. We've had travelers from all over Tal'Dorei and beyond. It's incredible." (all giggle)
Matt: "I'm in the process of planning an expansion to another town. Perhaps even --"
Laura: Oh, my.
Matt: "--perhaps even opening a second store in Westruun."
Marisha: You're going to own a chain?
Orion: Congratulations!
Matt: "Perhaps."
Orion: This is a big step for any businessman.
Taliesin: Spectacular.
Matt: "But yes. No, I have been able to take on two more arcanists. We've been in the process of designing some more interesting, wondrous items. We have stocked many of our recent possible and available items. We are doing quite well for ourselves."
Orion: Are you looking for investors, Gilmore?
Matt: "I technically am your investor, in a way."
Orion: Oh.
Laura: He is.
Marisha: True, we are sponsored by him.
Matt: "But. If you have the money in which to sponsor our business, that's a whole other discussion."
Orion: I just wanted you to talk to me for a little bit. Vax, take it away.
Matt: "Dragonborn. But yes! How about yourselves? You look like you've --"
Matt: He gives you all a look over.
Matt: "--like you've maybe not slept in a fortnight."
Liam: Well. We're lucky we're not dead. It came close a couple of times. We were off on official business for the emperor. We've been underground for weeks and weeks. We've only seen the sun for a couple of days.
Matt: "Oh. That kind of a weekend. I know how that goes."
Liam: Needless to say, our stores are terribly depleted. We are going to need to stock up a bit before we head out of town again. I don't want to rush things, though. I think my friends probably want to shop about. My sister can probably handle things for me. I would love to take a stroll with you around the city. Get a bit of lunch, a bite, and hear about what's been happening. Hear the rumors of town. We all know nobody matches your shrewdness in business. That's no surprise.
Matt: (chuckles)
Liam: But I'm wondering what you've heard. What's on the wind? Can you take the afternoon off?
Matt: He looks over at the same half-elven woman who was trying to stop you earlier. She gives a look like, 'what's he going to say?' No one's ever asked him this question. He goes,
Matt: "For you? Of course." (all laugh)
Marisha: Man date. Go for it!
Laura: Don't worry, Gilmore. We'll take wonderful care of your employees.
Matt: "Well if you wish to do business, why not do that now?"
Laura: We need to shop around first, of course.
Matt: "Very well."
Taliesin: And we're so curious as to any of these interesting and fascinating things that you've developed in the several weeks it's been since we've been here. We'd love to see what you've been working on.
Matt: "Very well. Sherri!"
Matt: The same woman, her shoulders droop.
Matt: "Yes, Gilmore?" (all laugh)
Matt: "Would you be so kind as to see to whatever our friends need? These are Vox Machina, by the way. They are currently sponsored by Gilmore's Glorious Goods, Inc, and I would very much like to make sure that they are taken care of."
Matt: "Yes, sir. I'll make sure that happens."
Matt: (laugh)
Taliesin: (laugh)
Matt: "So. Shall we?"
Liam: I think this will take a while. Let's.
Laura: Have a wonderful time, brother.
Liam: I look to my sister as we go.
Liam: Just get what I need, will you?
Laura: Of course.
Liam: Thank you.
Liam: And stroll out the door with Gilmore. Have at it, ladies and gentlemen.
Travis: Yes!
Marisha: We'll leave dinner on the stove for you.
Matt: So Sherri looks at the rest of you as they leave and goes,
Matt: "So you're all friends of Gilmore, then?"
Marisha: Yes.
Ashley: Business friends.
Matt: Business friends. All right.
Marisha: We're mutual fans of one another, if you will.
Matt: She adjusts her glasses.
Matt: "Then let's continue with the business. What are you seeking? What do you need? What are you looking for?"
Orion: I don't know. We like all kinds of things.
Marisha: Well, we definitely need potions.
Matt: "Potions. Those we can provide."
Marisha: Health potions.
Matt: "Health potions, yes. Potions of healing can be provided."
Marisha: What do you have right now?
Matt: She goes behind the counter for a second and ruffles through some stuff. Goes in the back room and comes back out with a wooden crate, pretty much. You hear the glass jangling inside as she moves it and sets it on the counter with a ting. They all eventually come to rest. She goes,
Matt: "All right, looking through here, it looks like we have about 12 regular potions of healing. We have six of greater healing. And it looks like three of superior healing."
Ashley: What's the price on the superior healing, again?
Orion: We'll take the lot.
Ashley: What's the price on the superior healing, again?
Ashley: What's the price on the superior healing, again?
Matt: "Superior healing? Let's see, currently those go for about --"
Matt: She looks at the price book, going through.
Matt: "Those will run you --"
Matt: As I go through my price book.
Ashley: We are sponsored.
Taliesin: We do keep getting turned to stone. This has been a problem, and it's been sticking around a bit. I feel like we should maybe take some precautions for the inevitable next time this happens.
Matt: "That will be 1500 gold pieces per superior."
Marisha: Is that with our sponsorship prices?
Matt: "Right, you mentioned you're sponsored. That would be a 10% discount. That would bring it to about 1350, should you wish to purchase them individually."
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: I definitely need one of those.
Laura: Wait. How much if we're purchasing them individually?
Matt: "1350 gold pieces per superior healing potion."
Orion: How much for the lot?
Laura: And if we buy in bulk, what can you bring it down to?
Matt: "If you buy all three?"
Laura: A thousand each?
Matt: "I'm sorry. You've already been given the discount via Gilmore. That price stands as it is. Let's say you buy the three remaining items, I'll give you 1200 apiece. And even that I'll probably get in trouble for, but he seems to like you."
Laura: 1200 apiece? Yes?
Travis: We'll take that.
Taliesin: Sounds good.
Laura: Three superior.
Matt: "Very well. So 3600 gold pieces. Three superior are yours."
Matt: She pulls them out of the crate and slides them across. They are thick, very heavily-made glass vials with these small glass handles on the side. You can see the interior. The liquid itself is a reddish purple, almost blood color, but there's a gold sheen as you shake it in the light. You can see there's a spark of divine glow to it.
Marisha: Like Goldschlager.
Taliesin: Classy.
Matt: Kind of. It's the worst of healing Goldschlager.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: "Is that all you require?"
Travis: Do you sell any love potions?
Matt: She gives you the blank stare and goes,
Matt: "No." (all laugh)
Travis: Right. Sorry for asking. Jeez.
Taliesin: I would also say we should take the six superior healing potions, as well.
Orion: Absolutely.
Matt: "The greater ones."
Taliesin: Greater.
Laura: What did we just buy? We didn't buy superior?
Taliesin: We bought the three superior. We should also get the six greater.
Laura: Six greater. All right. How much is that?
Matt: "Those are 500 apiece. With your discount, that would be 450 apiece."
Laura: But if we're buying all six, 400 apiece is a very good price.
Orion: Now, this is the Vex I miss.
Matt: Roll a persuasion check.
Marisha: Persuasion check, persuasion check!
Orion: Persuasion check, persuasion check!
Taliesin: Persuasion check, persuasion check!
Liam: Vex hasn't had a chance to haggle since the show started.
Marisha: Yep.
Liam: All she used to do before this show was haggle.
Marisha: We used to take food breaks.
Marisha: No!
Laura: Fourteen.
Matt: Fourteen? She goes,
Matt: "Let's call it an even 425 gold pieces each."
Laura: I like this. I'm comfortable with that.
Matt: "All right."
Taliesin: 425 times 6...
Matt: She brings out her arcane calculator.
Marisha: Her arcane calculator? Once again, our charity.
Matt: "That’ll be 2550 gold pieces."
Laura: All right.
Matt: And she pulls out the six that are there and she kinda slides them over the counter to you. One tips over but she catches it, leaves it there at the far end.
Travis: Careful with those.
Matt: "They’re fine, they can take a beating, they’re designed that way."
Travis: So can I.
Matt: She pushes her glasses up and looks vastly unimpressed at the presentation.
Laura: How much were the superiors again?
Matt: "The superiors were 1500 brought down to 1200 apiece, yes."
Laura: 1200. Which came to 36?
Taliesin: Thirty-six.
Taliesin: So do you have anything, we keep getting turned into stone, it’s been sort of a running theme. We were hoping you might have something to help alleviate stone skin or any --
Matt: "We do have potions of petrification removal."
Taliesin: Yes! Petrification removal.
Matt: I think. Let me check.
Matt: And she goes in the back room, rummages around for a minute, comes out and she presents two of them. They have a clear liquid that looks almost like dirty water, and they’re like thin little vials, she goes,
Matt: "These potions, when applied to the flesh, will, more of an oil I guess you would say, removes the affliction of petrification. These do cost 750 gold apiece."
Laura: We have greater restoration from Pike, and she can cure --
Matt: "Then you’re fine."
Matt: And she takes them --
Orion: How many potions are there?
Matt: "Two."
Liam: But in the heat of the moment.
Orion: Get them.
Taliesin: In the heat of the moment, it might come quite in handy.
Liam: A stone Grog in the middle of a fight?
Travis: I agree.
Orion: It takes her a day to learn that and she can only do it like once or twice at the most.
Travis: I think we need to get it.
Taliesin: I’d rather have the potions than the gold, to be fair.
Marisha: Let’s just get one.
Taliesin: And we haven’t discussed our discount.
Marisha: I should learn how to make potions. I should learn this.
Liam: Money is meant for spending.
Laura: Do we want to take one?
Orion: Take both.
Taliesin: I’d actually say we take both.
Liam: Not that I’m here.
Laura: Take both. 750 was not the discounted price.
Orion: No.
Matt: She gives you another look of like, ugh. She adjusts her glasses.
Orion: To be fair, we are spending a lot, right? Overall, so.
Ashley: Overall.
Matt: "That would come to 1350."
Taliesin: Thirteen fifty.
Travis: We’ll take it.
Laura: 1300. Remember, we’re very good friends of Gilmore’s, he said to treat us well.
Matt: Make another persuasion roll. This is my new fan dice.
Matt: It’s awesome, thank you.
Laura: That was really good.
Matt: It’s awesome, thank you.
Laura: That would be 21.
Matt: It’s a good thing. She gives you a look and goes,
Matt: "I don’t like you." (all laugh)
Matt: "Thirteen hundred."
Laura: Thirteen hundred, lovely, thank you.
Marisha: Sherri? It was Sherri, right?
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: Do you have any books on how to learn how to start making your own potions? Or do you know of any classes in town where maybe I could sign up for like a potion workshop?
Matt: "Nothing here, but that’s not a bad idea, might run that past Gilmore."
Taliesin: You should offer a workshop.
Marisha: You should absolutely offer a workshop.
Matt: "That’s a good idea,"
Marisha: You should absolutely offer a workshop. "otherwise the Lyceum would be the place to look."
Marisha: The Lyceum?
Matt: "Yes."
Marisha: Okay.
Orion: Do you have any potions of strength or any ability potions?
Matt: She leaves for a second, then comes back and goes,
Matt: "No, I’m afraid those were all purchased. However, we may have more in a few weeks or so. They take some time to create and the ingredients are a little bit scarce. However, trade is opening, perhaps --"
Marisha: Someone purchased all of your potion of strength potions?
Matt: "Yes."
Marisha: Oh. How many did you have?
Matt: "We had four, I believe. Varying giant strength types."
Ashley: One person did or it was just a bunch of people just buying.
Matt: "It was a handful over the period of time."
Marisha: Oh.
Orion: I’m gonna hand her also a ticket, a scroll of telescription and be like,
Orion: When it comes in, please write that it has and I will be notified via this parchment.
Matt: "Very well."
Matt: She folds it and places it in a little cubby on the side.
Orion: Thank you.
Matt: "Is there anything else you require? We have many magical, various armaments and/or protective items."
Travis: Armaments, what kind of armaments you got?
Matt: "Well, if you’ll follow me."
Matt: She leads you up the stairway to the second floor. The second floor itself is just a series of glass cases that are leaned at an angle. In these cases you can see there are different items just laid out, small labels at the bottom with
Travis: Oh. a brief description of the enchantment.
Matt: She leads you across, she goes,
Matt: "Well, first we’ll start here with the ring section."
Matt: You can see there’s a small case that has along this purplish velvet pillow, a bunch of different rings set out. She goes,
Matt: "We have varying degrees of rings of protection. These rings are designed to protect the individual who wears, we have one I believe with the basic enchantment, and one with one step higher above that."
Matt: The equivalent of a ring of protection +2.
Matt: "That ring runs 6500 gold. We have a ring of psychic resistance that does protect yourself from various mental intrusions. We have a ring of evasion that can be utilized three times a day, or one to three times a day. Should one of you not be quite quick enough to avoid any sort of incoming danger. You could allow yourself a successful escape. That runs 4500. We also have a ring of water walking. This one has been popular in the past for some various traveling troupes that wish to do various performances that require defying the surface of water. It gets a bit shifty now that I think about it, but you know, whatever folks will enjoy. Peasantry is easily pleased. So those are our rings at the moment. Should any of those tickle your fancy, please do let me know. Here --"
Matt: And she points over where there is a thick leather belt with like three straps across that looks highly well made with what looks like square runic carvings on the side.
Matt: "--this is what is referred to, and this was import from Kraghammer, but we’ve had it in here for quite some time, a belt of dwarvenkind. This belt, when adorned, does increase the physical heartiness of the individual as well as giving them positive interaction with other dwarves. And we haven’t fully tested it yet, but apparently it also seems to resist against poison intrusion in one’s body, allows you to see better in dark places, and apparently grants you the ability of speaking, reading, and writing Dwarvish."
Laura: Oh wow.
Marisha: I need that.
Matt: It is 5000 gold.
Laura: I bet that’s very expensive...
Liam: One month ago you needed that.
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: What was the first ring?
Travis: Ring of protection.
Matt: "The first ring was the ring of protection."
Marisha: Plus two, right?
Matt: It gives a plus two bonus to AC and saving throws.
Marisha: That’s really good.
Ashley: What was the evasion one?
Matt: "That one, that’s the ring of evasion."
Ashley: Yes, what was that?
Matt: It has three charges and it regains 1d3 charges per day. When you fail a dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend a charge and auto-succeed on the saving throw instead. Good for people who have low dexterity.
Travis: The one that protects you psychically, could you repeat that one on the menu, please?
Matt: "The ring of psychic resistance --"
Taliesin: Oh god.
Matt: It gives you resistance to psychic damage, so anyone does damage that is psychic-based, you take half damage.
Laura: That’s not quite it.
Travis: It’s not good?
Laura: No, it’s not quite the same.
Travis: Not even for me?
Laura: Do you have anything to make Grog smarter?
Travis: Well, fuck off. (all laugh)
Matt: She looks over at him for a moment and goes,
Matt: No. No we don’t.
Laura: Any crayons so he could be occupied?
Travis: Do you have crayons?
Matt: "We have colored writing implements for children, if you’d like."
Orion: Yes, please.
Travis: I saw a few children in town. Maybe they would like them.
Matt: She goes back downstairs and comes back in a moment. She presents two small boxes that contain small colored wax things. You can see on the outside it has a picture of Gilmore, and he’s doing this, and it says Gilmore’s Glorious Colored Sticks.
Orion: Of course.
Matt: "These are usually reserved for the children of our customers, so if the children will enjoy it, enjoy."
Travis: I’ll take one of those, please.
Marisha: Yes, trust me --
Travis: The colors are quite nice.
Marisha: --the children will.
Matt: "Five gold pieces apiece."
Marisha: Five gold pieces apiece? I thought they were free, like when you go to an O’Charley’s or an Applebee’s.
Matt: "What’s an Applebee’s?"
Orion: It’s a hellhole, apparently near where you used to live.
Matt: It’s one of the layers of the Abyss, it’s like around --
Marisha: One of the infernal layers of the Abyss.
Matt: About layer 943.
Marisha: It’s getting pretty low, yeah.
Ashley: So I’ve been talking with Scanlan and I know he was interested in the plus two AC ring.
Marisha: I think we should pick that up for sure.
Ashley: What’s the price on that?
Matt: "Sixty five hundredd gold pieces for that."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: "With your discount, that would bring it --"
Matt: Goes back and looks again at her magic calculator, I’m an actor not --
Liam: It’s an abacus.
Matt: Exactly.
Matt: "That brings it to 5850."
Ashley: Well, he does have this amazing ruby gem. He was maybe thinking of trading that for maybe bringing down the price?
Matt: Do we know how much that was worth?
Liam: Uh.
Matt: Has Scanlan looked at his sheet and found what it’s worth?
Liam: Scanlan? Speak up,
Ashley: Scanlan,
Liam: Scanlan? Speak up,
Liam: Do you know how much it’s worth?
Liam: I think you wrote it down. He’s talking quietly.
Matt: There was the diamond also that was repaired in the mending wheel.
Matt: He can look that up as well.
Marisha: There was a diamond.
Liam: Vex, do you remember how much that diamond was worth, we got that diamond --
Matt: Oh no, we lost them.
Taliesin: We lost them.
Marisha: Oh no!
Matt: Redial, redial!
Marisha: This is important!
Liam: I got it.
Marisha: How much is the diamond worth?
Matt: "Regardless. Other things of interest, nothing that would make him smarter, that would make him quicker."
Liam: This is so period. It’s just like Lord of the Rings. Beep beep beep.
Matt: Magical sending stone.
Liam: God damn it!
Marisha: Answer!
Matt: Answer your Facetime.
Marisha: Answer, bitches.
Matt: Vex!
Orion: I hate when you call and you know that they’re there and they don’t pick up.
Liam: All right, well I’m not here anyway, so I’m just gonna keep doing this, as you were.
Matt: We’ll come to it. so I’m just gonna keep doing this, as you were.
Matt: "Regardless."
Marisha: We know you’re there!
Matt: She continues on, showing you through, she goes,
Matt: "Well, I don’t necessarily have anything that would make him smarter. We do have something that would make anyone quicker."
Matt: She goes a second, there is a big, thick leather tome.
Matt: "This is an ancient tome that was enchanted many, many generations back. Upon properly reading and studying this tome, one would increase their physical dexterity permanently."
Marisha: Oh, I like that.
Matt: "It only has its abilities and power once a century, so it does come quite pricey."
Marisha: What is that price?
Matt: "Fifteen hundred gold pieces."
Marisha: We should buy that.
Ashley: We should probably buy it.
Marisha: A tome that increases your dexterity plus one.
Laura: It’s on my phone now. We switched.
Matt: That’s okay.
Matt: "So there is the manual of quickness of action, we also have the hat of disguise --"
Matt: And she produces this like -- (Facetime noises)
Matt: And she produces this like --
Matt: She produces this fine brass cap that has intricate swirling runes on it and what looks like a small set of ears that are pushed on the sides so when it fits on the head it looks almost like a smaller head on top of yours. She says,
Matt: "This cap when worn, however, one can alter their appearance however they see fit. We also have --"
Matt: She pulls out this thick, leather armor that has a brownish-blue trimmed hue to it and goes,
Matt: "This is what we refer to as coldsnap leather armor. It has an enchantment to improve one’s armor class by two. While wearing it, you have resistance to cold damage."
Marisha: Is it leather armor, you said?
Matt: "Leather armor, yes."
Marisha: How much is that?
Matt: "That is 7500 gold pieces. We also have the cape of Mountebank. It is a cape that when triggered --"
Matt: She takes it and shifts it for a second, you can see a little bit of smoke plumes off of it, smells sulfurish. She goes,
Matt: "While wearing it, you can use it to teleport yourself a short distance instantaneously, once per day. We have this --"
Matt: She pulls another dark cloak off the wall. This one looks like it’s made of dark fur, but as she shakes it you can see these two little tendrils are on it. They like wiggle about, these little spiked edges to the tendrils.
Matt: "This is a cloak of displacement, enchanted and taken from the body of a displacer beast. While wearing it, it makes it so your body projects an illusion. Anyone attempting to cause you harm has difficulty actually finding purchase on your physical form, not knowing where you truly stand."
Orion: I will take that cape.
Matt: "It is 4500 gold pieces."
Orion: Wonderful. Vex?
Orion: Oh, shit. She’s not here.
Matt: "I’ll put this aside as a possibility. We have a pearl of power."
Matt: She pulls up from this small box, she opens up the top lid.
Matt: "This enchanted pearl, you can use it to speak a command word and regain one expended spell slot, up to third level, that you’ve already used. Once you’ve used the pearl, it can’t be used until the next dawn, so once per day you can just return. It’s for your caster-types."
Marisha: A third-level spell?
Matt: "Yes, up to third level, one spell slot, you can immediately restore it. It does require attunement, however, and you can’t have more than three items attuned to you, so be aware of your limitations."
Ashley: What’s the price on that one?
Matt: "This is 550 gold pieces."
Ashley: Okay.
Orion: Pike, do you have any 3rd-level healing spells?
Ashley: Do I have 3rd-level healing spells? I do.
Matt: "We’ll put it aside as a possibility. I also have --"
Matt: And you move to the side, going through the armor section as well, she goes --
Matt: "I have a mithral chain shirt, as well as an enchanted mithral chain shirt, there is a plus one enchantment on it as well. They are flexible and can be worn under normal clothing, does not impose disadvantage on dexterity or stealth checks. It is considered light armor. There is golden chainmail, it’s a plus one enchantment."
Matt: Then she goes to what looks to be a series of weapons. She brings forth a very fine-looking dagger, that has --
Liam: Everyone hears from the back, Scanlan’s voice piping up saying, "Just buy all this shit!"
Marisha: Just buy all this shit.
Ashley: Buy everything.
Marisha: How much money did we have? Didn’t we have like at least --
Liam: Thirty... thirty-ish. I mean, I’m not here, but --
Matt: And you still have money you haven’t collected in Kraghammer, too.
Marisha: Huh?
Matt: There’s money you still haven’t collected in Kraghammer. Lord Nostoc Greyspine, you guys made a deal with him before you went down in the pits.
Liam: So maybe we could open up a line -- I’m sure you guys could open up a line of credit with my buddy Gilmore.
Marisha: A line of credit?
Liam: Yeah, an I.O.U. Once we’re back from our day.
Marisha: So we’ve got like roughly 30k?
Liam: In our possession now. Thirty-one.
Orion: We have over that. Because Vex and Grog are with us. And they have --
Matt: She has all the money. So we’ll just keep track of what you guys spend and bring it back to Vex, your treasurer. And she’ll be really angry that you guys spent all that money.
Liam: She’s trying, she’s trying, it’s coming up on my phone.
Orion: The trick is, we don’t know how much the total is.
Marisha: We generally would if our party’s here. She just can’t tell us at this moment.
Orion: It’s well over thirty. I think we have closer to fifty. ... maybe forty.
Matt: So she presents this dagger to you guys --
Marisha: We don’t want to deplete all of our funds.
Matt: So she presents this dagger to you guys --
Matt: "This is a fine dagger,"
Marisha: We don’t want to deplete all of our funds.
Matt: "This is a fine dagger, the blood runs themselves are enchanted --"
Marisha: We also spent a lot on the keep, "the blood runs themselves are enchanted --" don’t forget that, we dumped a lot of money into the keep.
Matt: Yep, you did.
Marisha: So we might have more like thirty.
Matt: You guys spent quite a bit on the keep. All right.
Ashley: What’s this dagger?
Matt: "This dagger actually can take the lifeforce from an enemy when delivering a very strong blow."
Matt: Essentially, on a critical hit on the attack roll -- (all cheer)
Ashley: We got it. (all cheer)
Orion: Here they are. (all cheer)
Marisha: How much money do we have?
Laura: We have --hold on, let me look.
Travis: Twenty-four thousand --
Laura: No. I normally don’t,
Laura: We have about 20,000, all right?
Orion: So we have 50,000 total. Because we just had 30, we just got paid 30 grand, right?
Matt: Yeah, ten.
Marisha: No.
Marisha: Ten grand.
Matt: You got ten grand from Allura and you currently have a floating --
Marisha: And she added that.
Orion: That’s added?
Laura: I already added that, we’re at 20,000.
Orion: I thought we were at 30 --
Marisha: We spent almost 50,000 dollars on our keep.
Orion: Right, but --
Travis: Plus those fucks in Kraghammer owe us a fortune.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, 25,000 gold is still owed by Lord Nostoc Greyspine.
Orion: That’s who owed us.
Marisha: Yes, that’s what we’re saying.
Orion: What?
Marisha: That’s why we’re saying we only have 20 or 30 --
Taliesin: No, we haven’t gone back there.
Orion: So we’ll have to go back and get it.
Taliesin: Eventually, yeah.
Matt: "So while you --"
Laura: Will you point us a little bit out so we can see --
Matt: "As I was saying, this dagger, upon a very impactful wound on a foe, steals a bit of its life force, dealing an additional ten necrotic damage, and then gives the wielder ten temporary hitpoints."
Laura: Whoa, that’s major.
Matt: "So there’s that. We also have an enchanted heavy maul, and we have --this is quite a find here."
Matt: As she pulls out this wooden case, she pulls back the wooden top to it. As she does, you can see there’s a little bit of ice crystal that’s gathered along the interior of the wooden case. There inside sits a short sword, a relatively thick short blade, but the blade itself is like a blue, almost glimmering metal, and there’s actually a rising frozen mist that drifts off the blade.
Matt: "This is an enchanted frostbrand. It acts as a shortsword. Whenever it does damage to an enemy, it does an additional 1d6 cold damage. And while you hold the weapon you have resistance to any fire damage you would take. At freezing temperatures, it sheds a ten foot radius of dim light, and when you draw the weapon, you extinguish all magical flames within 30 feet of you."
Taliesin: Fancy.
Matt: "And those are currently all the things we have at the moment. We’re working on a few more things that will be ready in the next couple of weeks, but those are the current haul for our above-the-average consumer. Magical creations."
Ashley: I have a question.
Matt: "Yes."
Ashley: Do you have anything that can make armor... ... quieter? (all laugh)
Ashley: Maybe like a really heavy armor, that’s really quiet.
Liam: That oil from the Wizard of Oz.
Matt: "We don’t have anything for that, but we could have it commissioned for you if you’d like."
Ashley: I would like to see about that.
Matt: "All right. I’ll have to talk to Gilmore. That’s more in his realm of enchantment, but that is a possibility."
Matt: She adjusts her glasses again.
Matt: "When he returns, whenever that is, we can discuss with him what you’d like, yes."
Ashley: That would be great.
Matt: "All right, well."
Ashley: Thank you.
Orion: I will take the enchanted mithral shirt
Orion: I will take the enchanted mithral shirt and the cape, thank you very much.
Matt: "All right."
Matt: And she grabs the --
Orion: But that’s not the total yet. Vex has to talk about the rest of what we want.
Ashley: What’s the price on the dagger and the sword?
Matt: "The sword is 8500 gold pieces. The dagger is 7800 gold pieces. This is without your discount. The mithral chain shirt, it is medium armor, I lied. It is 5250 gold pieces."
Orion: Wait, I can’t --
Matt: You can’t wear armor.
Matt: "And you were looking at the pearl of power, which is 550 gold, and there is the cloak of displacement, which is 4500 gold pieces."
Travis: Would you be interested in a trade?
Matt: "What do you have to trade?"
Travis: We’ve got lots of bits from dragons, lots of bits from umber hulks, and we’ve got basilisk eggs.
Marisha: We also have that diamond and the ruby. Do we know how much that is?
Orion: Yes. Do we know how much that is?
Laura: We also have some jewels.
Marisha: I definitely say we pick up that ring with the AC and I wouldn’t mind having that leather --
Laura: The ring of protection?
Marisha: That ring of protection that gives you plus two to your AC. That we need for somebody. And I wouldn’t mind having that leather armor. That adds a plus two to my AC.
Matt: "Cold snap?"
Marisha: Yup.
Matt: "All right. There are the things we are looking at currently on this table, we have the belt of dwarvenkind, the manual of quickness of action --"
Marisha: We should get that too.
Matt: "--cold snap leather armor --"
Marisha: Get that manual.
Matt: "--cloak of displacement, ring of protection plus two --"
Ashley: Put the dagger and sword on the table also.
Ashley: Just in case.
Matt: "All right."
Ashley: Throwing it out there to see, I don’t know.
Matt: "They are there on the table."
Laura: We have nowhere near enough for all of this.
Laura: We have nowhere near enough for all of this.
Orion: Let’s see what the total is.
Marisha: We could trade,
Orion: Let’s see what the total is.
Marisha: Let’s see what we can trade around maybe.
Matt: "So the total for all of these items, including --"
Matt: She starts going through her --
Marisha: I want new stuff. I haven’t gotten new armor since we started.
Taliesin: I haven’t either.
Orion: You should get the mithral shirt, it adds something to your --
Marisha: Do you wear light armor or medium armor?
Taliesin: I would guess light armor, I imagine.
Matt: "With the discount, this entire haul would come to 49,815 gold pieces."
Ashley: What’s that, how much?
Marisha: 50k.
Matt: "49,815 gold pieces with your discount for this entire sum. Now, would you like to pay in gold? Would you like to pay in--"
Liam: Get the dragon armor out.
Orion: Twenty-four total, before the dwarven--
Ashley: Maybe we can see how much we can trade of what we have, maybe we can get a little--
Laura: How much is a pound of dragon scales worth to you?
Matt: "What dragon? Show me the scales."
Laura: Blue dragon scales.
Travis: Blue dragon scales, here you go.
Matt: You pull them out of the bag of holding. She takes a few and she takes her glasses off and then pulls out from a pocket this intricate-looking, multi-lensed tinkering viewing device and inspects it very closely.
Laura: It was a very powerful dragon.
Matt: "Apparently not powerful enough if you have these."
Travis: Hey Pike, don’t take this shit.
Marisha: I don’t know if that was a compliment or an insult.
Travis: Hey Pike, don’t take this shit.
Matt: Puts it away in her pocket and goes,
Marisha: Taking it as a compliment.
Matt: Puts it away in her pocket and goes,
Matt: "These are legitimate. I won’t question how you came about them, but they are definitely legitimate. A pound, you say?"
Laura: How much is a pound worth to you?
Travis: We have several pounds.
Laura: And I’ll tell you how much we have.
Laura: And I’ll tell you how much we have.
Matt: "Say a pound of dragon scales --"
Matt: And the dragon scales themselves are about that big each, they’re about the size of a peach.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Dragons are big, especially this one.
Matt: "Blue dragon scales, I’d say a pound is maybe, guessing close to eight to ten scales. That would be worth about, I’d put that at 1,000 gold credit for each pound provided."
Travis: I have at least 11 pounds.
Laura: Yeah.
Orion: Perfect.
Laura: So that’s another, at least, what? Eleven thousand?
Liam: Five hundred thousand gold right there.
Laura: That’s like another 10,000 we have in dragon scales.
Travis: We have 11 pounds of dragon scales.
Marisha: And how about that diamond that we put in the mending wheel?
Orion: No, ruby.
Laura: It’s flawless and beautiful and so sparkly.
Marisha: How much?
Matt: Pulls that again, looks over it.
Marisha: Catch.
Matt: "This ruby, probably about 500 gold pieces."
Laura: That’s it?
Travis: We also have three dragon teeth, fangs from the beast’s mouth.
Matt: Make a perception roll.
Orion: Oh sweet, and they froze there.
Matt: Or not that, a persuasion roll.
Orion: Oh no, they --
Marisha: Oh no, they didn’t!
Liam: I’m gonna tell them. Oh my gosh.
Marisha: Persuasion roll. Oh no!
Liam: You have to make a persuasion roll, quick.
Taliesin: That’s hilarious.
Matt: Timing is everything, folks. Timing is everything.
Taliesin: Timing is everything.
Ashley: I have one dragon fang around my neck.
Matt: That’s a keepsake for actually slaying a dragon. You’re welcome to trade that. It’s worth quite a bit.
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: No.
Ashley: That was the white dragon?
Matt: That was the white dragon.
Orion: Yeah, it was the white dragon you killed.
Matt: That’s the one that you got the final blow on.
Marisha: What was your persuasion?
Matt: That’s the one that you got the final blow on.
Taliesin: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.
Marisha: What was your persuasion?
Taliesin: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.
Ashley: I know, I gotta keep it.
Matt: Anyway.
Taliesin: Gotta keep it.
Ashley: Keepsake, can’t put a price on it.
Liam: Ten. Ten, they rolled a ten.
Matt: They rolled a ten. She says,
Matt: "Dragons’ teeth actually, strangely enough, are a little easier to find. I would put, each dragon’s tooth available would probably add about 250 gold pieces to the exchange."
Travis: We’ve got three.
Marisha: And how about the basilisk eggs? While we’re --
Liam: Get it out out.
Marisha: --cleaning our bag out, exactly.
Travis: We have two basilisk eggs we’re willing to part with.
Matt: As you pull out the basilisk eggs, you pull it out and immediately there is a stench that is emanating from these eggs that have been in your bag of holding for probably close to eight or nine months.
Travis: No, the smell means they’re good.
Matt: This is now the fourth time she’s looked at you with a deadpan glance and adjusted her glasses.
Matt: "We’re not interested in the eggs, but thank you anyway."
Travis: All right, we do have three pints of dragon’s blood.
Laura: This is super, super powerful.
Travis: It might’ve congealed a little bit actually, though.
Ashley: No, it’s absolutely just really fresh because we put it in Tupperware.
Matt: "We’ll stick with the scales for now." put it in Tupperware.
Laura: You’ll stick with the scales.
Travis: Right, any chance you’d be interested in claws of an umber hulk?
Liam: I like that the 400,000 people who saw that thing are tuning in to the shopping episode.
Taliesin: To the shopping episode! are tuning in to the shopping episode.
Marisha: To the shopping episode! are tuning in to the shopping episode.
Orion: Hi everybody.
Liam: We’ve been fighting and killing for weeks,
Liam: We’ve been fighting and killing for weeks, and now we’re haggling over prices.
Orion: But we do need new gear.
Matt: Timing is everything.
Marisha: We do need new gear.
Matt: This has now turned into the flea-market episode. Hey, you guys guide the story. It’s fun though.
Marisha: You guys guide the story. Hey, you guys guide the story. It’s fun though.
Matt: "We’d say with the credit from the dragon scales, that’ll take 10,000, 11,000 away from the current pricing, that would put us at 39,815 for this batch."
Marisha: So can we open that line of credit we were talking about?
Matt: "What line of credit?"
Marisha: That line we’re talking about right now. (all laugh)
Orion: Well said, your majesty.
Marisha: That one that I just said two seconds ago?
Liam: Wait, DM, where am I with Gilmore?
Matt: We’ll get to that right now.
Orion: It takes time to make a --
Laura: We could advertise for Gilmore.
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: We could advertise, but maybe we should wait until they get back so if their walk goes really well, whatever that means, we could maybe try to strike a deal.
Marisha: Right, put this on layaway?
Laura: He’ll probably give us everything for free.
Ashley: Because we probably need to talk to Gilmore about the credit.
Orion: True.
Taliesin: Yes, that’s fair.
Marisha: So can we hold this for now?
Ashley: We’ll wait until Gilmore gets back.
Matt: "Certainly."
Ashley: We’ll wait until Gilmore gets back.
Marisha: Oh, good.
Matt: "If you wish."
Matt: Starts putting everything into a small layaway pile in the corner.
Marisha: So you guys. Natural history museum? Pizza and then natural history museum?
Orion: What is pizza?
Matt: In the meantime.
Orion: It sounds wonderful.
Marisha: We’ve got time, we’ve gotta wait for their man-date, we can go see some sights.
Matt: In the meantime. for their man-date, we can go see some sights.
Liam: In-between time.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: In-between time.
Matt: Yes. Gilmore, who has sweeped you out into the middle of Abedar’s Promenade, takes you by the arm and begins to lead you happily up towards the Erudite Quarter of Emon, which has a secondary wall around it as well. As he brings you along, he talks happily and loudly about how,
Matt: "It’s rather wonderful the way that we were presented with this opportunity over in Westruun. It’s magnificent, the team they’ve assembled to build this brand. I’m very excited at how they brought it to my attention. I wanted to keep things very localized, of course, but it seems--"
Liam: Will you trust the folk in Emon to handle your business or will you go between?
Matt: "The folk in Westruun?"
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "The folk in Westruun?"
Matt: "I have a couple of friends there that will oversee the process, but I will be very involved and keeping an eye, so I’m not too terribly worried. Besides, it’s a much smaller business we’re running there and it’ll be fine. Oh, look ahead."
Matt: As you guys step into the Erudite Quarter, he’s now brought you into essentially what is an outdoor botanical garden that is just a very nice walk. Grass across the ground, with fine well-cut bushes. There is a canopy of beautiful trees that are arcane, through arcane means, twisted and sculpted to form this long tunnel. It’s strangely romantic. As Gilmore begins to walk you down, there’s a fountain to the side, and he says,
Matt: "What about you? How’s Vox Machina been? How’ve they been treating you? How are you, Vax?"
Liam: Well, we’re tired, to be sure. I was not kidding before, we really are lucky to be alive. And that’s thanks in large part to a lot of the gear you outfitted us with the last time.
Matt: "Wondrous, I’m happy to help. And have you been keeping up your end of the bargain? Have you been singing the praises of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods across Kraghammer and beyond?"
Liam: You were mentioned in Kraghammer. I regret to inform you, though, that we were forced to travel underground rather quickly and the duergar and the other things that we ran into were not really customers you’d want to deal with. No, our lives were too much in harm’s way. But now that we’re above ground, I’m looking to pick up where I left off.
Matt: "Very well." And do your shop honor.
Liam: Your contribution to what we’ve done --
Liam: And I place my hand on his hand.
Liam: --was no small part in our survival.
Liam: And I give it just a little squeeze.
Liam: And I want to thank you. I don’t know that I would be standing here if not for your help.
Matt: "Had it not been for Gilmore’s Glorious Goods." (all laugh)
Matt: He looks you deep in the eyes, pats the top of your hand, and goes,
Matt: "Vax. This, that moment, that is why I do what I do."
Liam: You’re a unique man, Gilmore. No question. Never met anyone quite like you.
Matt: "Well. Would you care to share a glass of wine with a man not quite like anyone else you’ve met?"
Liam: Indeed. What do you recommend in the area?
Matt: "Oh, please, come, there are casks that pour the finest of honeyed Syngoran wine. I know perhaps you’ve not been home for quite some time?"
Liam: That’s a complicated thing for me, one that I’m not really quite ready to talk about yet.
Matt: "Oh."
Liam: Maybe someday.
Matt: "Maybe with enough wine."
Liam: You old so-and-so.
Marisha: You old so-and-so.
Matt: About an hour and a half, time passes before eventually there’s a loud clattering at the front of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods, where a laughing Vax and Gilmore come stumbling in, flush of face, with emptied goblets, laughing to themselves. Is there anything specific before this moment that you wanted to ask --
Liam: I took the duergar, I was holding her right over the cliff, and I just cut, and she fell! She fell! I didn’t know what I was doing, I just did it!
Matt: "You are ridiculous, Vax'ildan! Oh, it tickles me."
Ashley: Hi! Hello!
Matt: "Oh, good to see your friends."
Ashley: Sounds like you had fun.
Liam: Family. Family, family. I’ve had a couple of drinks. I’m an adult, I can do that.
Liam: What have you found? Have you guys been shopping?
Marisha: Well, we have!
Orion: Yes!
Marisha: Well, we have!
Marisha: We were hoping that you and Gilmore had a wonderful time and that, we just thought we’d wait for you. We didn’t want to make any final decisions without one of our main party members.
Matt: "It was delightful. You travel with the finest companion. We told stories, we cried, we laughed. It was a delight."
Matt: "I’ve had a few."
Matt: He collects himself for a minute.
Liam: I pat him on the back, I do a little circle with my hand.
Marisha: Remember, you have advantage.
Matt: "I’m not as spry as I once was, unfortunately. But yes! Business to attend. What do you need? What can we do?"
Matt: At which point Sherri, waiting in the back, says,
Matt: "Sir, they’ve requested perhaps a few things in bulk. The current amount comes to about roughly 40,000 gold, with your discount."
Matt: "Forty thousand gold, oh, well. Certainly. What seems to be the problem?"
Ashley: Well, I don’t know. We were just talking about, since we’re purchasing so many things, and since we’ve gained some popularity here in Emon, walking around, people are noticing us walking around...
Ashley: I shouldn’t be the one talking right now.
Ashley: Maybe we could open up a line of credit.
Liam: Obviously we’re only shopping with you, Gilmore, at this point.
Matt: He looks about the rest of the group and says,
Matt: "Not everyone seems to be wearing the same patented Gilmore’s Glorious Armor that was given not too long ago. So that’s not true."
Orion: We did find some off of dead things.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "And those dead things are not under the umbrella of Gilmore’s Glorious Expansion."
Orion: Oh.
Matt: "But should we discuss this, where would this credit be placed against, what do you have that you could ante?"
Liam: What have you guys been talking about? We do have a big pile of dragon’s scales and some gem --
Laura: We do.
Taliesin: We also are owed money.
Liam: And we are owed money in Kraghammer.
Laura: One question that
Liam: And we are owed money in Kraghammer. Grog just whispered to me.
Liam: Yes?
Laura: How much is a platinum worth?
Matt: "What is a platinum? Platinum is worth ten gold pieces."
Liam: Where we at, girl?
Orion: She is displeased.
Laura: We may have a lot more money than I thought we had, because Grog’s been hiding money in the bag of holding. (all laugh)
Travis: It’s really shiny.
Travis: I’m in trouble, Matt. She’s really mad.
Marisha: Wait, is this like when you slapped Trinket on the ass mad?
Laura: No. Not close, not even close. Doesn’t mean as much as Trinket means.
Liam: This is finances, this sounds like a married couple.
Taliesin: How much platinum do we have hiding in the bag of holding?
Travis: I don’t have the number in front of me, but it’s at least 150.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Where did we procure that again, Grog? I’m sorry, I’m a little fershnickered.
Travis: I don’t remember, but it’s in the bag of holding.
Laura: I remember getting platinum.
Marisha: I do remember getting platinum, too.
Matt: But you don’t have a number.
Travis: No, I know it’s at least 100, at least 150, I think it’s somewhere up north of 150, I just can’t remember the number.
Liam: Did we get that from the dragon, where did we get that?
Matt: It was a combination of the dragon, the horde you rage-looted --
Laura: Rage-hoarding. the horde you rage-looted --
Laura: Rage-looting.
Liam: I’ll never forget the rage-looting.
Ashley: Rage-looting.
Liam: I’ll never forget the rage-looting.
Travis: It’s my shiny, though, I didn’t want to give it to her, though. She’s evil. You see how she haggles!
Liam: It’s true. She’s my sister, I know, Grog. But right now we need to put that aside and do what’s best for the party.
Travis: Well, we could buy a party with all that. (all laugh)
Liam: Not that kind of party, Grog.
Laura: I think we have enough to buy everything if you guys want.
Liam: Grog, money is meant to be spent.
Travis: I’m going to drink! (all laugh)
Ashley: That solves everything.
Matt: Scanlan goes,
Sam: I agree. Drinks and whoring.
Matt: And smacks Grog in the side. The two of them leave off into the evening to go ahead and make use of their return to Emon properly.
Liam: Vax looks at Gilmore and just shakes his head.
Matt: "There is business to be had, but let’s get business out of the way so we can get to pleasure."
Ashley: Oh, shit.
Liam: Cheers to that.
Marisha: Cheers to that.
Taliesin: I have tinkering to do anyway.
Laura: What did we agree the total for everything we wanted was?
Matt: "Roughly 39,500 gold pieces."
Liam: Pish-posh.
Laura: Roughly. Gilmore.
Matt: "That’s with the discount! I already offered this to you, and you haven’t even kept up your end of the bargain by wearing my emblazoned symbol and my"
Laura: Don’t you want us to advertise in Westruun for you? "immortalized Gilmore’s Glorious Armor."
Liam: We would, Gilmore, we would be wearing that. Again, we nearly died. The armor that you gave me is gone, and I’m lucky to be alive today, and that armor helped me be where I am at the moment.
Matt: "How much credit do you wish to open?"
Liam: Fifty gold.
Ashley: Thousand? Fifty thousand?
Liam: Fifty, ah yes. Fifty thousand.
Matt: "Because 50 gold I can definitely do."
Liam: We’ve been out drinking for two hours, man.
Matt: "This is true. I’m sorry."
Ashley: One million, please.
Matt: "That’s a tough order."
Matt: "You mentioned you had money waiting for you in Kraghammer. How much was --"
Laura: Yes, we do.
Matt: "How much is waiting for you there?"
Liam: Twenty-five, wasn’t it?
Laura: It was 25,000.
Matt: "How about we open a 25,000 gold piece line of credit here with Gilmore’s Glorious Goods that you only need to pay back within the next month."
Liam: That’s fair.
Matt: "Giving you time to arrive. If it’s not paid, you will be hunted. But I’m sure that won’t be a worry, will it?"
Orion: How far is Kraghammer from here?
Taliesin: Not far.
Laura: It’s a week’s ride, isn’t it?
Orion: I can’t teleport everyone.
Marisha: Gilmore, question. Maybe you should consider making little pins that we could just wear on top of our armor? Because wearing your armor, we have our own clothes that we like, so maybe like a pin.
Matt: He steps forward and says,
Matt: "Oh --"
Marisha: Or like a patch?
Matt: "--that’s not even a worry."
Matt: He pulls out a small implement, this wand, and he flicks it over your shoulder. And all of a sudden an arcane swirl around your armor, with a big flash of sparks and glitter almost. You look down and there is, emblazoned upon your current armored form, a symbol of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods now permanently emblazoned on the leather.
Marisha: Ah!
Matt: "Easy enough to fix."
Liam: What a good idea.
Marisha: I was going to put it on that leather.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: I was going to put it on that leather.
Marisha: I was going to put it on that leather. My mom gave this to me.
Matt: "Well, your mother has not provided for you the means of keeping the deal we already made."
Marisha: Can you take this off when we pay you back and put it on that one?
Marisha: Oh, come on.
Taliesin: I think it’ll transfer when you change.
Marisha: Will it transfer when I change armor?
Matt: "I don’t know." (all laugh)
Ashley: We’ll find out.
Matt: "So. Twenty-five thousand gold line of credit, within a month or you’ll be hunted."
Marisha: Wait, do you really have a unicorn as part of your logo?
Matt: "It’s…"
Marisha: What?
Matt: "It’s a creature of my creation, I designed it when I was a child --"
Liam: It’s a phallic thing.
Marisha: Ah.
Laura: So we open the 25,000 line of credit with you and you give us all the things we want?
Matt: "If that is what you want."
Liam: Don’t we have a lot of platinum? What are we dickering prices with?
Laura: Yes! Why don’t we just buy it now, and then we won’t have a line of credit with Gilmore?
Travis: (cries) and then we won’t have a line of credit with Gilmore?
Liam: Yes, we’ll use some of the platinum. One platinum is equal to ten gold. Sorry, Gilmore. Trying to dicker over rates.
Ashley: Not a line of credit?
Liam: No line of credit, we’ll pay for it outright in cold hard platinum.
Matt: You don’t have the amount of platinum with you.
Liam: But Grog’s got it.
Matt: Grog said, because he doesn’t have it in front of him, he has around 150 platinum.
Laura: We can pay him back, it’s true.
Matt: That’s roughly 1500 gold.
Matt: That’s roughly 1500 gold.
Liam: But where is it?
Matt: It’s in the bag of holding, but he doesn’t have the bag of holding information in front of him.
Liam: He doesn’t have the info. And because he doesn’t have the sheet --
Taliesin: --next game.
Liam: --and he can’t read the exact amount?
Matt: Yup. Because he said in memory it’s 150 platinum. That’s only --
Liam: I thought it was a 100,000.
Matt: Oh, no.
Laura: No no no, 150 platinum.
Liam: Oh, 150.
Matt: Hundred thousand you’d be the richest man in the fucking world.
Liam: Okay. in the fucking world.
Matt: So 150 platinum --
Liam: What do you think, sis?
Matt: --based on memory is 11,500,
Liam: Vox Machina treasurer?
Matt: which is a little helpful.
Laura: Right.
Liam: What do you think?
Laura: That would put us at about 30,000 that we have to spend left, which the signal cut out so it doesn’t matter.
Matt: No, we’ve got you.
Marisha: No, we can hear you!
Liam: No, we’ve got you.
Marisha: No, we can hear you!
Laura: Okay.
Liam: So the total tab is what again, Gilmore?
Laura: How much do we have? He does have a picture of it. We have 1,620 platinum.
Marisha: What!
Matt: Is that right? There you go.
Orion: So that’s like--
Matt: 16,000 gold pieces.
Liam: All right. Spend it.
Liam: Spend it.
Marisha: All right. No!
Ashley: So we don’t need to open up a line of credit?
Liam: No.
Matt: Ten gold per platinum.
Orion: We have 1,000.
Matt: A thousand platinum. One thousand six hundred platinum. Move the decimal point. That brings it to 16,000 gold pieces.
Orion: Move two on that.
Matt: No, it’s not 100 gold per platinum, ten gold per platinum.
Matt: I’ve been saying ten gold per platinum this whole time, guys.
Taliesin: No, I’m with you.
Orion: I get it.
Liam: We’re losing our audience. Ring it up.
Matt: We’re getting into math in this.
Marisha: Our charity, 826LA, after-school tutoring.
Taliesin: It could’ve made this all go so much better.
Marisha: Really good to have,
Taliesin: It could’ve made this all go so much better.
Marisha: Your reading and your writing and your arithmetic.
Taliesin: For players who can read good.
Marisha: For players who can read good.
Liam: Ring it up, we’ll take it.
Ashley: We’ll take it all.
Liam: The whole lot.
Ashley: And then, could I commission you, by the way, to maybe make some armor that’s really heavy armor but very quiet?
Matt: "How heavy?"
Ashley: How heavy can you make it?
Matt: "I can work on plate armor if you’d like, but an enchantment of that magnitude would be the only enchantment it would have. So it would be the equivalent of full plate armor and the entire enchantment would enable you to move a little more easily inside it, and that would cost, it would take about, I'd say, a month to enchant on my end and would cost about, not including the cost of the actual armor, materials and time required, I’d put it at about 8,000 gold pieces?"
Liam: Worth it.
Liam: We’ll fund the money.
Ashley: And it’ll just be really quiet?
Matt: "It will enable you to move freer within the armor."
Liam: By a turn. Is 8,000 Vox Machina’s rate, or the general rate?
Matt: "That is through our friendship and our current arrangement."
Liam: Thank you. It’s appreciated.
Matt: "Mm."
Matt: "Business is business, but please don’t take this solemn,"
Liam: Of course. "but please don’t take this solemn, intense face to be anything other than friendship, this is just business and I run a business."
Liam: Understood.
Matt: "Good."
Liam: I’m not taking advantage.
Matt: "All right."
Matt: "So. To take all of these items, with the dragon scales included, bringing it down to 39,000 gold. We’ll call it even, 39,000 gold."
Taliesin: Fair.
Laura: That wasn’t much of a discount, Gilmore.
Liam: Hush up, Vex’ahlia.
Liam: Done, sold, thank you.
Liam: With our thanks.
Matt: "So minus the platinum, that’s 22,000 gold pieces after the platinum and dragon scales."
Marisha: And we have that, right?
Matt: "And you have 25,000 gold credit if you’d like."
Laura: We have, hold on... gotta go away for a minute.
Liam: We’re passing on the credit, Gilmore.
Laura: We have plenty left.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: All right.
Liam: You guys are a black screen, what happened?
Taliesin: They paused it.
Laura: I was looking at my calculator.
Liam: All right, we hear you. There you are!
Orion: Abacus!
Liam: You’re so dark sometimes, Vex’ahlia. I swear.
Laura: So the total was 20,000 minus the platinum and the dragon scales?
Matt: "Twenty-two thousand."
Laura: Yes, we still have enough, so.
Matt: "All right. So a deal?"
Marisha: Deal!
Taliesin: Deal.
Laura: My god, all of our money’s gone.
Matt: He snaps his fingers, Sherri comes and presents all the items that she had currently in a little stowaway bin off to the side of the desk. Brings them out to the rest of you and places it on the counter. Gilmore immediately snaps his fingers and a contract shows up. He writes up the numbers exchanged, making note of his business, passes it out.
Matt: "Please sign here. Anyone that represents you and your fine Vox Machina. Sign here and present the money."
Laura: I guess I’ll do that.
Taliesin: You do that.
Matt: "Vex’ahlia."
Matt: He hands you a quill. Takes your coin, slides you, and you now have this entire batch of magical items
Laura: That’s pretty cool.
Matt: to distribute as you see fit.
Matt: to distribute as you see fit.
Marisha: Yes! New armor!
Matt: And from that point --
Laura: Make sure we get some of those things.
Matt: "An absolute pleasure doing business with all of you. Absolutely."
Marisha: Thank you, Gilmore.
Matt: "Thank you."
Marisha: So really though. Will this transfer to that?
Matt: "I have no idea."
Marisha: I was wanting to ask you, Gilmore. Have you considered maybe doing potion-making workshops?
Matt: "Hm. I’ll put some thought to that."
Marisha: Okay. Let me know.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: I feel very uncomfortable and I leave. I go outside to hang out with Trinket.
Matt: Okay.
Matt: As Gilmore takes the change behind the counter, he goes,
Matt: "I’ve got a bit more business to do here. Vax, I greatly appreciate spending the afternoon with you. Where are you staying?"
Liam: I take him by the hand, do one of these clasps, and say,
Liam: We live here now, we’re residents. I haven’t had time to tell you. We have a keep, our own keep. You should come visit. It’s on the outskirts of town. It’s called Greyskull Keep, and you’re welcome any time. Day or night.
Matt: "Good to know. All right. To business I go. I bid you all a fine farewell."
Taliesin: Adieu.
Marisha: Bye, Gilmore.
Matt: He goes back through his beaded exit to the back room and leaves you to the rest of your-- --at which point Sherri goes,
Matt: "I’ll get back to work."
Matt: She goes back up, leaving you guys alone in the main chamber as a couple of other customers start walking around.
Matt: I think we’ll call that the adventure for the evening.
Marisha: Thanks for watching us shop.
Ashley: Thanks for watching us shop!
Laura: All the money’s gone!
Matt: All the money’s gone. You spent it, guys.
Marisha: We have 25 waiting for us in Kraghammer.
Matt: That’s true, you didn’t open the line of credit.
Laura: Yeah, we’d better get that.
Marisha: At least we’re not in debt.
Liam: The world is full of money, Vex'halia.
Travis: We got more money?
Ashley: Who had dibs on what?
Taliesin: I wanted the dexterity boost and I was thinking of the mithral.
Marisha: And I want the leather armor and he wants the cape.
Ashley: I can't use the sword, right? The frostband sword?
Liam: No, clerics can't use swords.
Matt: Check on your class, you might have access to it. Let me check here for you real fast.
Liam: It used to be just blunt weapons for clerics, wasn't it?
Matt: That's the older version, they've changed a few things. They don't do it too often. Let me double-check. Cleric has access to all simple weapons. The sword is a martial weapon so you cannot use that as a weapon.
Ashley: That's okay.
Zac: Oh man. These donations tonight, guys.
Matt: That's great. I'm glad you guys are enjoying watching our--
Laura: Me and Travis are going to cut out.
Matt: -- Laura and Travis are taking off, guys.
Marisha: Bye guys, have fun in Florida!
Liam: We were so glad to have you, sister!
Laura: We were so glad to be here.
Marisha: What con are you guys at?
Laura: We're at MetroCon, down in Tampa.
Matt: MetroCon in Tampa. So if you guys want to go see Vex and Grog in person and you're in the Florida/Tampa area, go to MetroCon this weekend and say hi.
Laura: Let's see how tired we are tomorrow.
Marisha: MetroCon in Tampa.
Liam: Worth it.
Matt: Thank you guys.
Marisha: Have fun!
Matt: Thanks again for the chat that bought us dinner tonight, it was amazing and delicious. Thank you so much guys, you're amazing every week. So we're going to go to donations.
Zac: Let's get through these.
Matt: Yeah, all right. Thank you guys again for -- Once again, this was the recovery episode of a long, twelve-week battle through the underdark. This was interesting to come back to, I hope you enjoyed it. All right, so first, donations.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. I think this is our 24th episode, which is ridiculous. We've been doing this since March, and it gets more and more ridiculous every week. Glad you guys can join us. The new guys, welcome to our chaos. For all the old folks, glad you could come and join us again. Quick thing I want to mention: last week we were talking about the changes to Critmas, because we had stresses on scheduling and we had crew here, and when things go long, we were talking about possibly moving to Periscope on a different day, separate medium. Well, the fanbase has spoken very loudly and very intently about their reaction to that, and so what we're doing, to still make it so people aren't kept here for ridiculous hours weekly, we're still going to have Critmas on the stream, but it's going to be once a month. It's probably going to be the first Thursday of every month, and we're going to make it an extensive day for that month where we open everything that evening. We still get to experience and share that with you guys, but also not keep these guys here way too late unpaid every Thursday night. So I think that's the plan we're going with forward. Hopefully, that's cool with everyone, because we love it, too, and we want to make sure we still share that with you guys. All right, couple of other announcements. First and foremost, I wanted to mention again-- we mentioned it last week, as well-- there's that Hasbro game design contest, design the next party game. That's still up until end of this month, I believe. So if you want to check it out, you can go ahead and tweet at me, last week's episode or search for the Hasbro game design contest. That's still happening. Also, there's a film series that I'm a part of called Mythica. It's like a high fantasy film series where I play the main villain, the necromancer Zorloc. It's fun times. It's like awesome, fun, fantasy genre film. And they're currently putting up a Kickstarter to finish the post on the third film, so you should check that out. Search Mythica on Kickstarter and you should find it there. Also, WeLoveFine is still running their DND t-shirt contest for their Rage of Demons release for Wizards of the Coast, where you can submit your own t-shirt designs that fit within the Rage of Demons theme. I am one of the judges on that, so if you submit your art to this, there is a cash prize. All the rules are up there on the WeLoveFine contest site. And I'll be able to judge your artwork and hopefully put you through to the end. So there's that. Trying to get through these as fast as possible. Our TeeSpring shirt for Is It Thursday Yet? is still up. It has one more week. So if any of you guys want to get the limited edition Critical Role Is It Thursday Yet? shirt, that is only available for one more week and then it'll be gone forever, so get it while you can. Let's see. I'm doing my best to get through this as fast as possible. No worries. Not everything. Also, Ashley's show Blindspot is premiering this coming Monday. (cheering)
Matt: Which is so exciting. You can check out Ashley on Blindspot where she'll maybe be sneaking Critical Role stuff into the show, hopefully. We're trying to push her to do that. So you should go support her. See it. It's awesome. And all of us lament that's the reason she's away from us. Someone want to handle our other cool--
Laura: But it's not on us yet. Oh look, now you can see us.
Liam: Why don't I go, and then you can go. Hey, you guys. I just want to make sure all of you are aware-- this is going to be so awkward-- I want to make sure you're all aware of a Kickstarter that's out there that is put up by a good friend of mine named Joe Madureira. Now if you don't know who Joe is, he is a comic book rock god and a game developer. When I was a teenager, he made a comic book called Battle Chasers. Look, here's mine. From when I was 16, Joe. I fell in love with it. Nobody does art like Joe Mad does, and I've followed his art for years and years. Even when I fell out of comic books, I was checking in with Hellboy and I was checking in with Joe Mad. And then, years later, I got cast in a game called Darksiders as one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I played War, and I walked into the room and Joe Mad was in the fucking room, and then we became friends. So that game was amazing. Darksiders is a beautiful game. It just reeked of Joe's art style and now he has formed another company called Airship Syndicate and they have a Kickstarter up. They are making a game called Battle Chasers. Oh shoot! I didn't put the thing that comes-- oh, Nightwar! Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They've already hit their goal, but there are stretch goals. They are making an RPG, sort of in the ilk of JRPGs, like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. And it's just going to be bathed in the glory of Joe Mad's amazing art style. So they've hit their goal, but the bigger the budget, the better the game is going to be. I backed it already. And you guys should at least go check it out. A lot of love for Joe Mad.
Orion: Yeah, me too. I'm on the same end. I knew Joe Mad through meeting Liam for a while, and later realizing that this guy I knew as an amazing voice director and an amazing producer has inked some of my favorite issues of Excalibur, and I crapped my pants. I have four of yours, Joe, in my box right now at home. He's an amazing guy and awesome thing to back. Check it out, please.
Liam: And one, the main character from Battle Chasers kind of looks like Pike!
Laura: She does! I thought that, too.
Matt: That's sweet. Wunderbar!
Taliesin: I got something. Next weekend, September 26 and 27, I'm going to be at a con! In Anchorage, Alaska.
Orion: That means "convention".
Taliesin: That means moose. I'm so excited. Senshi Con in Anchorage. I'll be there. I know we at least have, like, three fans at the very least in Alaska. Come on by. I'd love to see you. It'll be awesome.
Matt: Fantastic. Speaking of conventions, guys.
Marisha: Oh man, drop it like it's hot.
Matt: For those of you upper East Coast folks, we've recently been able to announce that we will be at and running some events at New York Comic Con in October. All of us, the entire Critical Role team will be at Comic Con. We're going to have signing, panel and all kinds of fun stuff throughout the weekend. And we'll be there. And if you're in the area, or if it's drivable, or even if it's not, you should come anyway, cause we'd like to see you. If it's trainable, if it's flyable.
Travis: If you steal a horse, steal a horse and ride it.
Laura: If you want to ride a bear there, I wouldn't judge you.
Marisha: And what weekend is New York Comic Con?
Liam: Eight, nine, ten, 11.
Marisha: October 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th. So you've got three weeks to prepare.
Matt: Yeah, so excited to be there. Excited to see you there. And it'll be a lot of fun. A lot of fun.
Liam: Primarily doing stuff Saturday that we know. We're waiting to see what's going on Sunday weekend.
Laura: Saturday is for sure.
Taliesin: With more of us than are even here.
Travis: Bring your swag. Bring your friends.
Marisha: Not even all of us were at San Diego. Well, we were all there, just not all at one point at one time.
Travis: Because we were missing Sam.
Matt: The first full Critical Role con appearance. Boom.
Travis: The unicorn appears.
Orion: I'm going to get a hot dog.
Matt: Orion's going to get a hot dog. Awesome. Any other announcements? Or did you have something, you said?
Laura: No, I was just so excited about New York Comic Con, I wanted to be a part of that announcement.
Orion: I would like to announce that I feel pretty good.
Taliesin: I'm terrified, personally, but--
Orion: I know, but maybe that's why I feel so good.
Taliesin: You were right. It is awful.
Orion: I'll get shunned for it happening, then I'm like, oh, cool. I don't have to worry about me right now.
Marisha: So much pressure.
Laura: Should we say that we have Kit here?
Taliesin: No, we shouldn't tell them that we have Kit here. Let's hold that back.
Matt: Kit Buss is not here.
Marisha: We also have both of our artists here.
Laura: Kit and Wendy.
Matt: Kit and Wendy.
Marisha: Kit and Wendy. Come here! But come here!
Ryan: There's a 30-second lag.
Matt: We'll eventually have them say hello to everyone, but Kit Buss, our official CritRole artist who did all the original character designs, continues to produce amazing art for this show, is here visiting Los Angeles for the next week. So she's here on the set and we'll drag her out in front of the camera and embarrass her shortly.
Taliesin: I've been curious precisely how long the lag is, because--
Laura: It's about 30 seconds.
Marisha: We learned when we killed the carpet.
Laura: Yeah. (muffled yelling)
Marisha: Just time that. Time that.
Matt: I guess also an announcement for all you League players out there: awesome character just got announced called Kindred. Kind of a two-part thing. That wolf that's the part of Kindred sounds pretty cool so you should play it.
Travis: I heard that. It's subtle.
Matt: Real subtle. It's a good one. I think that's it, isn't it? I think we're good on announcements, and we can start.
Taliesin: I feel like we have, do we have an address? Address?
Matt: Oh, the PO Box?
Taliesin: Do we have that?
Travis: It's up. Yeah, he's got it.
Taliesin: It's up and in the chat?
Ryan: The mods are posting it in the chat.
Matt: The mods got that covered. Now diverting all Critmas images and the boxes, and we have arrived. Our nefarious Scanlan--
Sam: Whoa. Were you just talking about me?
Matt: Yeah!
Sam: Whoa, that's crazy. I was just talking about me, too.
Matt: As was the website, because your interview went up today.
Sam: Oh, that's right. I saw. Some of that I had my ghostwriter write for me. I have a biographer and a ghostwriter.
Travis: Is that a ghostwriter on retainer that we can also use?
Sam: Yeah, sure.
Matt: Good to know. Well, fantastic. Do you have any announcements you want to make, Sam, or shall we jump in?
Sam: No. Just that I don't have any dice but I can use Orion's and they're going to be awesome.
Laura: I have so many dice. Take this giant bag and just fish some out.
Sam: Great. Thanks.
Taliesin: The Bag of Disagreeable Dice.
Laura: No, let him find them.
Matt: All righty, then in just a minute, let us begin this next episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. All right, so to give you guys a little heads-up of what has recently transpired in the story. The party, after completing their business in the city of Vasselheim, on the far-off northwest continent. Grog, of course, having an epic battle in the Crucible fight pit against Kern, reclaiming his honor.
Travis: (singing) I am the champion, my friends.
Matt: Pike left back there to finish up the renovation of the temple of Sarenrae that was discovered. The rest of the party moved on back to Emon, the rest of their business complete. Within Emon, they returned to Greyskull Keep, where they encountered a fan, apparently, of Vox Machina, that had been camping for two weeks outside, who was promptly bludgeoned in the temple by Vax to teach him a lesson. Brought back from the brink, and taught that hard lesson-- that this is a dangerous field-- managed to seemingly reach out and touch the heart of this young, intrepid, wannabe adventurer to possibly try and better himself before he throws himself into danger's way. And he ran off to train harder.
Taliesin: Dagger, dagger, hug.
Matt: Indeed. Upon returning to the keep, notice was sent off to one of the other members of the Council of Tal'Dorei, Seeker Asum, who is the halfling head of whispers and all sorts of subterfuge across the countryside, who came to you notifying you that within a week's time, the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, are supposed to be arriving here within Emon for a feast to discuss building a bridge and a more political joining between Emon, the Tal'Dorei royal family, and these up-and-coming lords and ladies, who have a very dark history with Percy's character. You've been asked to join as part of this feast as you previously requested with sovereign Tal'Dorei, that should anything involved the Briarwoods that you be included. You have a week to figure out what you want to do in advance of that. And that is where we left off.
Orion: What time of the day is it?
Matt: Right now, after this discussion, you guys' arrival, I'd say it's probably mid-afternoon. First things first, though, after this discussion with Seeker Asum, who leaves the keep, you do have a brief moment of awkward silence as most of the people that work within your keep turn to you. Laina looks about the rest of you and goes, "By the way, we've been working here for about six weeks on the pay of four. We're coming close to our next pay scheme, and you tend to leave often and for extended periods of time. We would also like to be paid, if possible."
Laura: Most definitely, dear. Yes. We are definitely going to pay you. Does anybody remember how much we are supposed to pay them?
Orion: Pardon, what is the total of the staff's payment?
Matt: She thinks to herself for a moment, at which point you see Erwen, the elderly servant in the back says, "Actually, you had previously said it was both of our services was 50 gold each for the month. And if I recall, the other mercenaries or guardians that you've hired to watch the walls of the keep were at a discussed 100 gold for the month's wages. Each."
Laura: And how many of those guys do we have?
Matt: "You currently have five on your payroll, yes. 600 gold pieces total per month for the services for everyone keeping your keep."
Laura: Tell you what, I will front this from my personal funds for this month. Just because we don't have enough in the party funds to cover that.
Sam: We don't have 600 gold?
Laura: We do not!
Sam: Who's our treasurer?!
Laura: I am, but you bitches keep spending money!
Liam: I'll go halfsies.
Laura: Halfsies? Lovely. Twinsies will pay halfsies. Here you go! 300 for each.
Matt: "Thank you so much. I'll make sure this gets to the appropriate individuals immediately. They'll be very happy to not have to walk away. "
Laura: Yes, don't worry, you will always be paid from Vox Machina.
Matt: Erwen steps in. "And by the way, if you do intend to leave for an extended period of time again, I would recommend perhaps paying that in advance. There was a bit of unrest last time."
Sam: Should we pay another month?
Laura: Not yet. Not just yet.
Orion: I'll pay him in advance right now, just to get it out of the way. 600, out of here, phew, there you go.
Matt: "Very well, sire! I shall disseminate this amongst the others."
Taliesin: Traditionally, the head of the house does dispense out the stipends anyway. That would be appropriate. I'm not even in the room, am I? Never mind! Sorry.
Matt: Yeah, you're down in the workshop.
Laura: Can I go find Percy?
Matt: You can.
Marisha: Actually, we should all go find Percy. We should all talk to Percy.
Matt: "Thank you kindly, Tiberius. Thank you." And he wanders off and begins counting out change into a smaller purse.
Orion: When they start to go, I'd like to go to the temple with the sigils and talk to the guy who runs the place.
Matt: Oh, you mean the Lyceum?
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, the Alabaster Lyceum.
Orion: Yeah, because I learned something new this week and I was like, I'm dumb. But that's where I would like to head.
Matt: All right. So you make your way towards the Alabaster Lyceum. The rest of you head down into Percy's workshop. So you head around the outskirts of the inner portion of the keep itself, down the stairway that leads to the basement floor, which contains a small cell, like a holding cell that you had constructed for you in case you had somebody to take prisoner at some point. To the right. To the left of you, there's a small turning hallway that leads to the workshop. The workshop contains a series of various tools, workbenches. It actually has a working forge, with anvil and various blacksmithing tools. And as you guys come down, the heat is already blasting from it, and you can see Percy madly diving into work of some kind.
Travis: What are you doing, Percy? You making more mousetraps? Guess not.
Taliesin: I'm a bit busy. I am making more ammo. I'm working on a few projects that have been rolling around in my head for quite some time now.
Orion: (whispers) Don't forget the bolt.
Taliesin: The bolt is on the list, yes.
Laura: Quite the worker.
Taliesin: I've got a lot to do.
Laura: Yes. Darling...
Taliesin: How many of you are down here right now?
Travis: I think we're all here. I'm moving through his stuff.
Laura: I let Trinket forage around the courtyard, so he's not down here at the moment.
Liam: I think we need a little history lesson here--
Taliesin: Grog, don't touch that!
Travis: Why not? But it moves!
Laura: Don't touch anything.
Orion: Matthew, I took some fine meats before I left and I'm feeding them to Lockheed along the way.
Matt: Okay. Lockheed enjoys them thoroughly. They're delicious. Comfort food crafted by the finest of cooks in Greyskull Keep.
Marisha: Percy, it's hard not to clearly notice that you're quite distressed, and we're concerned. And you know, we were talking about it-- not that we were talking about you or anything, behind your back or anything-- but we never really found out why you were in that prison cell when we found you.
Liam: We've never questioned it before. We've never wanted to make you uncomfortable. But we're about to walk into a party, and I feel like we need a bit of a history lesson.
Taliesin: Ugh. I know you're right. (sighs)
Travis: Should we guess? Was it public nudity?
Taliesin: A bit. I've never had to say this out loud before. I've never actually had this discussion with anyone.
Sam: It's okay. It gets better.
Taliesin: Do I get an inspiration die for that?
Matt: I'll give you a d6 inspiration die. (laughter)
Taliesin: The Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, are responsible for the death of my entire family. Whitestone was my home. Many years ago-- I don't want to get into the details. I came from a big family. I came from a proud family. One night, they were invited into our home, and over the course of that night, they slaughtered everybody. They are evil. They are corrupting. The few survivors of Castle Whitestone who did survive only survived through deceit and by working for the Briarwoods, turning on their masters. Thankfully, the de Rolo family still has standing elsewhere, and there's other branches of the family other than my father's. (sighs) I was lost for quite a while after that happened. I had nothing else in my life other than my family. I was never really going to inherit anything. I was not going to run anything. I was idle. And at some point, I made the decision that, if nothing else, I survived to, maybe, extract some vengeance. Maybe set something right. Maybe stop whatever it was that they were doing. I don't know. There was one of their party, Dr. Ripley. She was in charge of something during the murder. I don't know what. I chased her. I chased her down. It took a year, and I had my gun, and I discovered where she was and where she was working on some ruins, and I approached her. I never even saw her face. Her guards captured me, beat me up. Didn't even bother taking my things. They just threw me in that dungeon. I never even got close enough to see her face.
Sam: You know her name, but you've never seen her before?
Taliesin: I saw her when she was interrogating me in my home.
Sam: Oh, so you could recognize her.
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Laura: How did you get away when they-- with the rest of your family?
Taliesin: My sister Cassandra, my younger sister. She somehow evaded capture. I don't know how. She set me free. I don't know what became of her. I don't know what became of any of my siblings. Probably nothing reasonable. Nothing good.
Liam: You witnessed none of these deaths?
Taliesin: I saw bodies of a few of them. It's all a bit shady. It's all a bit of a blur.
Sam: How many years ago was this?
Taliesin: (sighs) Four now. Five now.
Laura: If you know that they murdered your family, how are they still part of society?
Taliesin: I don't know. (sighs) I could have gone home. I could have gone home at any point, at this point. I'm scared.
Marisha: Did they take over Whitestone? Are they still there?
Taliesin: I discovered approximately a week ago that they're still at Whitestone.
Laura: Will they recognize you?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Travis: And these pricks are in good standing with the council?
Taliesin: (sighs) I don't know what to do. I'm preparing for anything. When I got thrown into that dungeon, I came to the realization that maybe I wasn't doing this the right way. I wasn't being responsible, and I prayed to whatever it is I pray to that maybe I would have a sign of what I should be doing, and then there you were. I've been trusting that Vox Machina will take me where I need to go, and maybe what I need to do is confront this, but I don't know what this is, and I'm terrified.
Liam: And the remains of your family, were they killed by the sword?
Taliesin: I don't know. There was an interrogation. Dr. Ripley was asking questions. I assumed, for all these years, that that's what became of my family.
Marisha: What was she asking questions about? What did they want? Was it just a political coup?
Taliesin: Asking questions about the castle, about things about the castle. It was a long time ago, and I was not equipped for torture. I don't remember much.
Travis: Do you want them dead?
Taliesin: I think so.
Laura: Should we interrogate them first? Find out more about your family?
Travis: Or just skip ahead to the dead part?
Taliesin: I put down my gun, and I turn the barrel, and of the six barrels, five of them have names, and Lord and Lady Briarwood are two of those names. Dr. Ripley is another.
Sam: What are the other ones?
Taliesin: Sir Stonefell is the other, and Professor Anders is the other, and then there's one blank one.
Laura: Are they all members of the same party? They travel with the Briarwoods?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Marisha: Wait, what were the names? The Briarwoods, Ripley, Sir Kerrion Stonefell. Who is he?
Taliesin: He was the captain of their guard.
Marisha: And Professor Anders? Who's that?
Taliesin: Professor Anders was my teacher. He was my tutor, and he was in collusion with them, and he was the one that I believe allowed them to take the castle in the night.
Marisha: And do you remember why they were invited to Whitestone to begin with?
Taliesin: They were traveling. They were on the road. It was my brother Julius and my sister Vesper who handled matters of court. I was studying. I didn't think.
Marisha: And how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Taliesin: I had six.
Laura: You might have six. We don't know what happened to them.
Marisha: You said you saw a few bodies of family?
Taliesin: It's all very much a blur. (sighs) There's things you just forget.
Sam: Well, this is certainly tragic, but looking forward, what do we know of this meeting? Event? Party? What are we doing?
Laura: Well, I think we need to do some spying.
Sam: Well, do they know Percy's among us?
Laura: That's the thing. I don't know if they do.
Taliesin: You don't have to get involved in this.
Laura: Oh, we are so involved.
Travis: (laughing) Yeah, we do. You said you want them dead.
Laura: We've got your back, darling.
Liam: Percival, you don't really have a choice in the matter. My sister and I know a little piece of your pain. I'm not going to get into it, but there's nothing she and I can do. We can find reparations for you. We will.
Marisha: Percy, is this what you want?
Taliesin: There's only one way to find out.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: And if we kill them, how much will you pay us? Just kidding. We ask other people that.
Laura: Something I do need to know. Percy. If we see them, and we're not ready to show our faces, will you be able to contain yourself?
Taliesin: I think so.
Marisha: And would they be able to recognize your face?
Taliesin: Which is why I was planning on-- I know we have a cap of disguise.
Travis: Oh! We do.
Laura: Scanlan has it.
Taliesin: I don't even know if they would recognize me. My hair was different.
Laura: Less purple?
Sam: We could go into town, and find you a bushy mustache. It's worked for me many times.
Taliesin: I don't think I wear one as well as you do.
Liam: How does that cap work?
Sam: Well, that cap is more of a hat. While wearing this hat you can use an action to cast Disguise spell. Oh. Cast a Disguise spell? Do you have to be a spellcaster to use it?
Matt: You do not have to, no.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: I see a shiny tool. I don't know what it does.
Matt: You reach over and grab it, and it's a large set of tongs, used for gripping large, heavy pieces of metal, either for the actual forge itself, or to bend and manipulate on the workbench.
Travis: I take it (yawns) and put it in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: Make a sleight of hand check.
Marisha: Stealing from the workshop that you partially own?
Travis: There are lots of cool stuff in there! What was the check?
Matt: Sleight of hand.
Travis: Where's sleight of hand-- 17!
Laura: My passive perception is 21.
Taliesin: No, this could be funny, let this happen.
Laura: I give him the evil eye.
Matt: She gives you the evil eye.
Travis: It hurts. I put it back.
Taliesin: Out of curiosity, what did you pick up, what did it look like?
Travis: It was a big thing of tongs. I didn't know what it did, I just wanted it.
Taliesin: A big thing of tongs? What would I have to roll to find out if it was covered in some basic sulfuric acid? If it was one of the things I was using for casting.
Matt: Ah, interesting. You know your tools very well in your workshop, and yeah, the metal is scarred and pockmarked from use with the various corrosive chemicals.
Taliesin: That'll take about ten minutes to take effect. All right. (gasping)
Orion: Stupid.
Laura: You're not there.
Sam: Well this Hat of Disguise, Percival, it requires some attunement. I don't know how capable you are with magical items.
Taliesin: I can find out.
Liam: We got seven days. I can make you look like anything. I can talk to the right people and get you the right paperwork and you can be anyone and no one will know a fucking difference.
Marisha: Calm down there.
Taliesin: I can forge paperwork, as well.
Laura: Oh yes, he can. He's actually the guy we go to.
Marisha: He is that guy you meet on the corner of Sandy Alley.
Sam: I can make us all into birds.
Travis: Are we supposed to go meet with the council right away?
Taliesin: No, in a week.
Sam: What do we do in the week? Prepare. Recon?
Laura: We can do things. How long of a ride is it to Kraghammer?
Matt: To Kraghammer, on horseback? It's about two and a half days.
Laura: Solo style, if you're fast, and back?
Matt: Fast and back? I'd say just under two days, probably.
Taliesin: How about the giant eagle flies?
Marisha: Yeah, what if you're flying?
Matt: I'd say, well, the horse is probably a little bit faster than the eagle.
Laura: But you don't have to stick to the road as an eagle.
Matt: I'd say it'd put you there about the same pace, about two days on eagle, because you can just go straight through. I mean, you want to take the road because you know that there's a lot of dangerous things that wander the wild that are between there.
Laura: What do you think? Is it stupid to go and ride hard and try to get there and back before--?
Sam: Wait, we're going to get cash and come back?
Laura: We don't all have to go. A couple of us can make a fast ride.
Marisha: Tiberius is working on it, I have a feeling deep down inside.
Orion: (laughs) Why would you say that?
Matt: You know I deduct points for metagaming.
Orion: I didn't do anything!
Taliesin: I agree we should send someone for the money. I agree.
Sam: And it won't take us a whole week to prepare for this party. All we need is a couple disguises.
Marisha: Yeah, but we need to do research. You barely know who the Briarwoods are.
Liam: We don't know if these people are straight up gangster, or if there's something supernatural, seriously supernatural, about them. That hat would probably work on 80% of people, but I don't know. We don't know anything about them.
Marisha: Well, they're not going to recognize any of us, are they?
Sam: We could go do some recon.
Travis: Besides, have we seen all the brothels in Emon? I don't think so.
Sam: We should do some research, some reconnaissance while someone goes for the money.
Laura: Or should we wait? I really want the money.
Taliesin: People get married in my family for money. I think it's perfectly reasonable.
Sam: Listen, we could all go get the money and be back in four days, right?
Laura: No, because some people need to do some work. We need to send some people off.
Sam: Split the party?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Hopefully be back in time.
Taliesin: There's four days. We can each do our part. Five days.
Liam: Keyleth, can you-- Kiki.
Marisha: Yes? Sorry.
Liam: Can you and Scanlan fly to Kraghammer?
Marisha: Yes. I would like to stop and talk to Gilmore first, though, before I leave. Do I have time for that? I can fly.
Laura: Our illustrious god just told us it's better to stick to the road because there's bad things--
Marisha: In the air? There's air traffic? I have to worry about air traffic?
Matt: By horseback, you want to stick to the road. By air--
Sam: By air, though. Check yourself, Kiki--
Marisha: What?
Sam: You, I would assume, use Polymorph as I do.
Marisha: No, I use my Beast Shaping.
Sam: Ooh. That's so sexy. Does that last for longer than a day?
Marisha: It lasts as long as I want it to last.
Sam: Damn!
Travis: I go up to the kitchen and look for something to eat.
Marisha: It's in my blood.
Sam: You can be an animal as long as you want?
Marisha: Where are you going with this, Scanlan?
Matt: You can stay in Beast Shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level. Five hours right now, you can transform for.
Marisha: So when I mean as long as I want, I mean, long enough to where I've never had to really think about it before now.
Sam: Well then, like me, flying there would not be an option. We'd have to stop, rest, walk, sleep.
Laura: Yeah, that would slow it down a lot.
Marisha: Well, I could get ten hours, because I can use two Beast Shaping abilities.
Laura: But that's still a two days' flight--
Liam: Two days is the horse, riding hard. What about an eagle?
Marisha: No, I get my druid shapes back after a short rest.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: Because Circle of the Moon, bitch.
Matt: So you could Beast Shape twice, rest 30 minutes, Beast Shape twice.
Marisha: Can I make a stop first, and then I'll run an errand?
Liam: We don't really have a lot of money at the moment.
Laura: She might have some.
Marisha: Yeah, I've got my personal fundsies.
Taliesin: Can you leave me an earpiece so that I can keep in contact? I'm not leaving my workshop.
Marisha: I have an earpiece, right?
Laura: We'll leave you alone, Percy. To work.
Marisha: Is there anything else you need from us, Percy? Is there anything you need while I'm out and about?
Taliesin: Leave me an earpiece, and I'll call if I need anything else.
Travis: Percy, is there anything in this shop that you want in the Bag of Holding for later?
Taliesin: Not yet. Thank you, Grog.
Laura: Do you not have an earpiece?
Travis: I'll give him mine.
Taliesin: How many minutes has it been? I'm wondering if his hands are starting to itch yet.
Matt: About this time, you start to get this weird tingling sensation around your fingers.
Travis: Do they crave blood?
Matt: No, they crave some sort of an agent that will prevent the now slight burning sensation.
Travis: Ow. Quick question. Sorry, I kept something from falling in the shop-- really quick reflexes-- it's making my bits tingle. Do you have anything for that?
Liam: You haven't been scratching yourself, have you?
Travis: No, I had that before. Not the same thing.
Taliesin: There's a bucket of water in the corner. You can try that.
Travis: I go over to the bucket of water and I stick my hands in the water.
Taliesin: It'll make it worse.
Matt: It does. The slight burning sensation now has turned into a very vibrant burning white hot on the skin, and you can see bits of the skin start to peel back a little bit, beginning on the edges.
Taliesin: I hand him a small bag of powder. Now you've learned not to touch things if you don't know what they are.
Travis: What do I do with a bag of powder?
Taliesin: I pour the powder on his hands.
Matt: It foams up a little bit in places, but it is neutralized.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: You're a good friend.
Travis: Can I leave now? I go to the kitchen to eat.
Matt: All righty. You easily get another meal mustered for you.
Marisha: I'm going to go make a trip to Gilmore's. Anybody want to join?
Liam: I should probably tag along.
Sam: I'll come, too.
Matt: You're working in the workshop, you're eating, you guys are going to Gilmore's. All right. So as this is happening, Tiberius, you make your way over to the Alabaster Lyceum. You come up to the front main area of the structure itself. It's an arcane college. You make your way to the front clerk, who looks up to you, a nice young fellow, looks like he's trying to work through his credit in school through his training. He's dressed in the ceremonial robes of somebody who is a student, who is currently stuck with the job of working as a clerk. He's like, "Hi, can I help you?"
Orion: Yes, hi, if you do not remember me, I am Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. Moreover, Vox Machina, over at Greyskull Keep.
Matt: "Where have I heard that--"
Orion: Well, we told you multiple times before. We met with you using your sigil of teleport-- it's fine. I've come here on a matter of business anyway, so that's neither here nor there. I was wondering if I may procure an address, or number as it were, for a sigil to Kraghammer. I believe the Thunderbrands would have some facility near theirs or on their own premises where their sigil could be channeled through the Circle of Teleportation spell.
Matt: "If you're talking about sigils for teleportation, you would probably have to discuss that with Gatekeeper Xanthas."
Orion: Where is he? I thought that was you.
Matt: "No. I'm the clerk. I run the front of the-- follow me." And he gets up and leads you further into the structure to the central circular room, the white-marbled room that contains all the doors around, and in the center there is the Traverse Junction. This is the place you guys have stumbled into every single time you've teleported back to Emon. And there you see the elven wizard who you recently bothered naught but maybe five hours ago, who is currently setting up some sheets, comes back. "Oh. Hello, again."
Orion: Hi. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull Keep. I was wondering-- and I asked your clerk here because I thought he did what you actually do here-- if I may procure, for coin or perhaps some kind of favor of sorts, the address or number or code or whatever it is that would work for the Kraghammer sigil of my Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: "I get an understanding here that you're seeking access to one of our many sigil-based rooms of transference. Those rooms are currently under very protected lock and key, approval by the headmaster Thurmond Adalum himself."
Orion: Okay, where is he?
Marisha: Oh my god. It's like calling Time Warner Cable.
Orion: Can you take me to him? Where is he at?
Matt: Glances over at the clerk, who goes, "Right this way, Mr. Stormwind." He leads you back to a long, long hallway with arched ceiling. You can see the marble itself has these carvings and sculptures of various dead-looking faces of long-passed mages that either were built or held in high esteem in the halls of this lyceum. At the very end, it opens up into a pretty well-decorated, almost over-the-top decorated office room for the headmaster himself. The interior is lined with large, large 15, 20-foot-tall bookshelves around this oval room with sliding ladders that are attached to them that slowly glide on their own, like they're on some sort of arcane-based pattern that puts them back and forth. There is a large chandelier of brightly colored orbs that sits 35, 40 feet in the air, that slowly rotates on its own that keeps this slowly fluctuating changing color of the room. And in the center there is a circular desk, and sitting there at the desk you can see is Headmaster Thurmond, who is this extremely elderly human male. Shaved face, very short, curved bald head with a little bit of hair in the back, hunched forward and is currently collecting a series of books into his arms. Looks like he's about to get up. And he turns and looks over. "Can I help you?"
Orion: Hello.
Orion: I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
Sam: I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
Orion: Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull Keep here in Emon. We are the saviors of this town and whatnot. Anyway, that's neither here nor there. I went through this fellow, who I thought was the job of this fellow, but it wasn't either of those jobs, it was you who I've been needing to talk to, I'm assuming?
Matt: "What do you require from me, then?"
Orion: I'm hoping to procure an address or access to the sigils of Kraghammer through my Circle of Teleportation spell and whatnot using your arcane gates. That's about it. (laughter)
Sam: Well put!
Matt: "If you're asking for access to one of our closely guarded sigils for the Thunderbrands, you say, within Kraghammer?"
Orion: Yes, yes. We'll have to speak with them as well.
Matt: "Well, then I will-- just one moment." And he reaches into a pouch and pulls out this mirror, this oval mirror and sets it onto his desk. Reaches underneath and pulls out a small chest. Opens up the chest, and you can see in this chest that there are probably two dozen of these tiny little marbles, all different colors, some different shapes, and he goes, these little labels you can't really see from your perspective. He takes one out, places it in the top of the mirror, and as he does, the mirror all of a sudden shimmers for a second, and what was originally a normal reflection is now this light, glowing blue, slightly glowing water-like surface. He takes it and lifts it up to himself. "Hello. Hello? Hello!" A moment later, you hear this distant voice echoing with this strange warbling filter over it. "I'm coming, what's taking your time. Yes, Headmaster, what do you require?" "Well, there's a gentleman here, dragonborn, who is requesting use of your sigil of teleportation. Do you know this gentleman?" Turns it around, and you can see in there, this is the same long-bearded dwarven individual that met you at the actual Thunderbrand house, and had a bit of an argument with you early in your travels in Kraghammer.
Orion: We've got things for you, this time, like we said we would get for you. In the Underdark. It's really inconvenient, but we have things that we need to get to you quickly.
Matt: "Now, listen here. Last we spoke, you and your friends stormed into our lair, nearly destroyed our precious arcane defenses of our homestead--"
Orion: He was drinking. He's an alcoholic. He's got help since then.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Orion: What is it?
Matt: This is deception. Well, you are an alcoholic, but that wasn't what he meant.
Orion: 20.
Matt: 20. (laughs) He goes, "Either way, we can't just let anyone willy-nilly knowing how to directly appear in the center of our homestead."
Orion: (in same accent as Matt) Of course. Oh, sorry, I started to sound like you. (laughter)
Taliesin: Bring me another accent, aye.
Orion: Of course. I wouldn't expect you to. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. My father Kruvanis Stormwind has helped the Council for over two generations. We come from a noble house, and I give you my word that I will never abuse-- abuse?-- however you pronounce it in your tongue. The privilege of quickly traveling to your stead to do business with you, and there would be no other intrusion otherwise. I guarantee it as my name as a Stormwind.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Sam: Chief negotiator!
Orion: That's 11.
Matt: 11. His head turns to the side a little bit, peering through you with a slight scowl. "Last we talked, the reason we didn't report you to the guard for breaking through our defenses was you promised to look beneath the city and bring back various artifacts you were in search of."
Orion: Ooh, we found one!
Matt: "Did you, now?"
Orion: A couple, yes. And we killed a bunch of those buttholes.
Matt: "Can I see one of these artifacts?"
Orion: I don't have it on me right now.
Matt: "We're done here, Headmaster." And the mirror shimmers and closes suddenly.
Marisha: Wait. No?
Liam: Good try!
Laura: We can bring-- oh, we're not there.
Matt: The headmaster takes the marble out and says, "I'm sorry that didn't seem to go your way."
Orion: It's fine, Headmaster. I'll be back in about 15 minutes with the proper proof that we did procure the things that the man, that needed to have proof, did. Excuse me! And I get the hell out of there. And as soon as I get out of there, I cast Fly on myself, and I Gandalf (whoosh) right back to the keep.
Matt: All righty. You're eating. You're crafting. Are you going with the rest of them to Gilmore?
Laura: I don't know. I guess so.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way to the outside of Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Sam: As we walk, do we see Tiberius fly over our heads?
Laura: Actually, I'm staying at the Keep.
Orion: Well, Travis is my target, right? Are you still at the Keep?
Travis: Yeah, I'm eating.
Matt: As far as time goes, you haven't quite gotten to that point yet, for these guys. You get to Gilmore's. You enter the interior. You can see that for the most part, there aren't a lot of people in here. It's getting later in the day, and a lot of the customer business seems to be happening almost earlier, either pre-noon, or around noon. There's no current sign of Gilmore. You do see, across the way-- what's her name, again?
Marisha: Sherri.
Matt: Thank you. Sherri, the mousy helper who runs the shop in Gilmore's absence, or at least runs the first portion of it, with her thick glasses up on her nose, and she's sitting there with her elbows over the top of the main desk. She looks up as you enter, and takes her glasses and pokes them for a second. "Hello? Hi."
Liam: Do you remember us?
Matt: "Right, I do."
Marisha: From Vox Machina? We're sponsored by Gilmore. He put the brand on my armor that my mother gave me.
Matt: "And you should be wearing it proudly, yes? Now, what can I help you with?"
Sam: Well, is Gilmore around?
Liam: Yes, I was hoping to catch up with him. We've been gone a while, and I was hoping to trade news with Glorious Gilmore. Is he not in at the moment?
Matt: "Gilmore's in Westruun, currently setting up the expansion of the Gilmore's Glorious Goods business. If this is important, I can certainly summon him here."
Liam: I'd hate to pull him away from business. I don't want to get in the way of his business. I mean, I am rather sad not to see him, but no, I don't think that would be a course of action we'd want to take. Let him continue to set up.
Matt: "All right, I suppose."
Liam: Can you get a message to him, though?
Matt: "Yes, I can, actually."
Liam: Well, tell him Vax'ildan and friends visited. We're in the city for a week.
Matt: She pulls out a small sheet of what looks like a rough-around-the-edges piece of parchment, and starts the inkwell, scribbling down.
Liam: Vax'ildan. That's with an A, not an E. We're here for a week. I don't know if he's going to be back from Westruun before then, but if he is, tell him to get word to me. I'm very interested in exchanging news for the past few weeks.
Matt: "All right." (foreign words) It flashes and disappears in front of her. "Well then, he'll be receiving the message right about now. We'll pass that on, and whenever he returns, I'm certain he will get back to you and deal with whatever business is necessary."
Liam: Thank you. We're here late in the day; are you still open for business?
Matt: "We are open, yes."
Marisha: I was just curious if you guys had a chance to think about the alchemy workshop that we talked about before, or if you maybe had any alchemy books that came in that I was requesting?
Matt: "It's possible. We haven't completely restocked the shelves, as of late. I know we had some new things come in. I can go check." And as she turns, all of a sudden there's a large, vibrant, white flash of light and a sound from the back room. The beaded curtains shift, for a second, and you hear heavy footsteps. And pushing through the beaded curtain, you see before you, with a bead of sweat on his head, Gilmore! "I'm so glad you came back!"
Sam: Gilmore!
Marisha: Gilmore!
Matt: "I'm sorry. I was out and about, running some business a ways away."
Liam: You didn't have to go to all that trouble to come back here.
Matt: "How could I miss seeing my fine-- there's not as many of you as usual."
Liam: No, we're seeing to different bits of business. I turn back to him, I walk forward with hands out. I walk up to him, take him by the head, give him a good European-style kiss just about here-- right there-- come back, and say, there is so much to talk about. Where can we be alone?
Matt: He looks over at the rest of the group. "Well, I mean--" (laughter) MATT "But of course."
Liam: See to whatever business you need to.
Sam: We'll just peruse, yeah. We'll window shop.
Matt: He walks back through the beaded curtain, giving you this look over his shoulder. As he does, the curtain falls behind him.
Liam: Those beads.
Travis: Oh jeez!
Liam: I walk right in. Follow him in.
Matt: And you can see now, as the glow gently fades, there is a rug that is pushed to the side, and on the floor of his room there is a familiar sigil, similar to the one that you've seen Tiberius scrawl before in some of his spells. That's apparently how he got here so quickly. But he walks in, and he kicks the rug back over it, sits down on the edge of his bed, puts his hands up and goes, "What seems to be troubling you?"
Liam: I walk over and I sit down opposite him, and I say: Before we talk about anything, I feel like I should apologize because although we didn't have any sort of written agreement, you and I are friends, aren't we?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: And I was supposed to help bring your brand wherever we went. And I thought that would be possible. We came back from the Underdark. We had a very hard time, some of the hardest weeks of my life. I haven't delivered on my promise. And I mean to, but I haven't yet. I apologize wholeheartedly. I'm sorry.
Matt: "That's all right. I understand  people grow busy. There are things you must tend to, and that's all right. And I appreciate you being so honest, I really do."
Liam: In addition to that, I am changed, and promises mean more to me, even more than they did before. And I promise to follow through. In the interest of time for the game, DM, Vax tells the whole story of the Underdark, of the horn, of how close it was.
Marisha: Ugh, what is taking him so long, Scanlan?
Sam: I don't know.
Matt: While that's happening, the rest of you are left there awkwardly staring about.
Marisha: Did Sherri find my book? Sherri?
Matt: A few minutes go by. Sherri comes back. She brings two books over. "Best I can tell, these may be what you're looking for? I can't quite--" She sets them down. One is a book that is the properties of various liquids, chemicals, and things that are found on this plane and otherwise. It's a good way to locate and identify phantom liquids, should you come across any.
Marisha: That would be good for Scanlan.
Taliesin: He is the source of a lot of phantom liquids.
Matt: The other book appears to have a section about alchemy. It's essentially almost a beginner's guide, but it's a very, very easy-to-follow introduction to a number of various low-level sorceries and the creation of low-level spell components preparing them for use with spell-casting, and there is a chapter on a little bit of alchemy.
Marisha: Okay, how much are these, Sherri?
Matt: "They haven't been priced, yet."
Marisha: I mean, they're-- they're all right.
Laura: Good going, Keyleth! I like it!
Matt: "25 gold, each."
Marisha: 25 gold, each? Oh, come on. I know some university student dropped these off and donated these. Don't kid me, Sherri. Am I doing it right? Do I sound like Vex?
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Marisha: Damn it!
Taliesin: I was about to say, make her do a persuasion roll, it'd be funny.
Sam: Unforced error.
Taliesin: I'm sorry! (laughter)
Liam: I spoke too soon!
Travis: So perfect! So perfect for you.
Matt: She reaches out and takes the books and slides them back, and says, "Well, if that's how you feel, perhaps these can be returned to those university students that perhaps left them by. I should put these in the lost and found."
Marisha: Sherri!
Sam: Sherri. If I may. What Keyleth was trying to say was that she never got a chance to go to college, and that she wanted to get that university experience.
Matt: "Good luck."
Sam: Well, that didn't work. Hey, can you serve me, now?
Marisha: (whispering) Scanlan. Scanlan! Will you buy those books for me, and I'll reimburse you?
Matt: "I can hear you. I'm right here." (laughter)
Travis: Walk away!
Matt: "Yes, I'm happy to help you."
Sam: I was wondering if you had a small box of some sort that could carry a magical item, and perhaps shield it from detection.
Matt: "That? Yes, we do have a couple of those. Hold on." She darts up the stairway in the other room and goes to the second floor. A few moments later, she comes back down with these two small chests-- they're about that big, each. One's a lighter wood color, the other is painted black all over. "We have both of these. They should shield something of this size from most low-level magical detections. These will run you about 200 gold apiece."
Sam: I just need one. You're a woman of the world, and I'm sure you have fine taste, judging by your appearance. It is quite fine, if I may say so myself. If I were a little taller, I would probably ask you out on a date.
Matt: "If you were a little taller, yes."
Marisha: Sherri is sassy today!
Orion: She's full of sass!
Sam: Which one is the fancier of the two?
Matt: "Well, looking at these, this one--" She points to the one that looks like just a casual, wood chest. "This would be easier to hide in plain sight amongst the rest of your furniture. This one, however, would be difficult to locate in a more shaded, or lightless, circumstance."
Sam: Hm. I want ostentatiousness.
Matt: "Then perhaps this one?"
Sam: Yes, please. That. Thanks. Thank you. 200 to you. Also, I know Gilmore is otherwise entertained. Can you try to identify something for me? Do you have that-- I mean, judging by the glint in your eye and beauty in your heart, I'm sure you have many skills I don't know about, but I'm wondering if you could identify this small, red vial with a floating something in it, that I procured quite some time ago! Do you remember that?
Matt: Yes. This vial, if I recall, it has this small--
Sam: Have I tried this, once before?
Matt: No, this is the one that was found--
Sam: Me and Pike found some stuff in somebody's house? I don't even remember, this was a year ago.
Matt: Right. Yes, okay. There we go. And make a persuasion roll, actually, on this one.
Sam: A lot.
Taliesin: Oh, look  a real roll.
Marisha: Shut up.
Sam: Persuasion? It's 35. Wait, 31. 31.
Travis: Matt just visited his mind palace.
Matt: She looks at you, and goes, "You have been good patrons, and you have been much kinder to me than others. We'll put this one on the house. We'll call this on the house." And as she takes the vial, sets it down, and she pulls out another book that she shuffles through, puts it up, turns through a few pages, until, looking through, "This here would be a Potion of Fire Breath. When imbibed, it should give you a temporary time period of the ability to breathe fire, much like a relatively young dragon. This one in particular is fire. There are many different vials like this that pertain to different colorations of dragon, but this one is specifically for the red."
Sam: Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, thank you so much. Two more questions, then I'll leave you alone. One: where can I go get business cards printed up, in this town? It's a calling card? Never mind! Forget it.
Matt: "Like a flyer?"
Sam: Yes!
Matt: "Those can be printed. There is a-- actually, a pretty well-designed print facility not that far up the road."
Sam: Oh, great! Thank you; I'll go investigate that. And one other thing: you know those books that my friend was asking about? Could we maybe make those happen for her? I know that you had quoted her a low, low price of 25. I'd be prepared to pay even more than that for them. And compose you a little song about yourself.
Matt: At which point, for the first time since the entire time you've been in the shop of Gilmore's Glorious Goods, you see a slight grin creep across her lips. She goes, "How could a lady say no to a song? 25 gold! The price stands."
Sam: So I have to pay you and sing to you?
Matt: "We run a business, here, yes."
Sam: All right.
Matt: She pulls the books out.
Sam: I bring out my-- something. (laughter)
Sam: (sings) Sherri baby, Sherri baby, Sherri, won't you come home tonight? Come home tonight? You better ask your mama. Tell her you're without a gnome! Why don't you come home to my keep!
Matt: "Pay for the books!"
Sam: Okay, here you go!
Matt: You can see, her face is flushed and she, (clears throat).
Marisha: I Druidcraft a flower real quick and slip it to Scanlan to give to her.
Sam: Oh! Here you are.
Matt: "Thank you."
Travis: (gasps) Did she blush?
Matt: She's red in the face. At this point in time, the beaded curtains reopen. Have you finished the conversation, or do you want to keep going?
Liam: No. After ten minutes of finishing all that, of telling every tiny detail, if you mind me backtracking, I briefly place my hand on top of his, and say, it was terrible. I've never seen anything like it. Now we're back. We're in our home, and I'm hoping to learn how Uriel is doing, how the city is faring. Is there any news? Things are ill in Kraghammer; they still haven't seen the last of their troubles, but I'm also concerned for our new home here.
Matt: "As far as I'm aware, this city has been doing rather well. Since Winter's Crest just this previous year, trade has been booming, we're opening up pathways all across the continent, we've improved relations with many other distant kingdoms, and I'm opening a second shop! I mean, that's amazing! And who would've thought?"
Liam: And Westruun, how's it going?
Matt: "So far, so good. We're going through the construction process, and I'm making sure that I have a rather supple income of artifacts and oddities that I have to sell at both locations. I have to widen my input of various items and--"
Liam: You're a busy man.
Matt: "Oh, yes."
Liam: Have you any time for leisure?
Matt: "Eventually." You can see, he's a little more worn than you've seen Gilmore before. He's still Gilmore, and he's excited, but after the tale you told him and opening the second shop has been a little rough on him, and his jovial self is a little more wearied. Though he still looks fabulous.
Liam: You seem a tad weary. Is there anything I can do to help you?
Matt: "Just praise the brand. Praise the brand, young Vax."
Liam: That will happen. I did not even mean to discuss this, coming here, but I noticed, coming in, a sigil under your carpet. I had no intention of this, but we need to get back to Kraghammer in a bit of a hurry, and I certainly have no abilities, but do you remember my friend Tiberius? Dragonborn fellow?
Matt: "Yes! Yes, I remember him."
Liam: He needs to run an errand back in Kraghammer. Is there any way you could hook us up with a favor?
Matt: "What kind of favor?"
Liam: I just want to send the lizard to Dwarf Town. Do you think we could make that happen?
Marisha: "Send the lizard to Dwarf Town?" How many more slurs can you have in one sentence?
Matt: "My sigil here is for returning personal use. Did you hear that? There was some strange noise in the sky. This is for my return. As far as outgoing, most other sigils are-- well, they're up here. Looking for that, you're going to have to go to the Lyceum, I'm afraid."
Liam: Understood. I don't want to push my luck.
Matt: "However, if you're going to the Lyceum... I am owed a favor or two. Let me see what I can do, here." And he goes, and he pulls out another piece of similar paper and he writes a quick little note on the side, sends it up in the air, and it vanishes. He goes, "I've just done you a favor. Keep that in mind. You go to the Lyceum, you should have access to one of these sigils. Make sure you choose properly. You only have one."
Liam: I'm pretty magic-stupid.
Matt: "Then don't be the one that does it. Talk to your friend, this Tiberius fellow. He'll know what to do, I'm sure."
Liam: Correct. One last. It's small or it's boring, it's business. I need a dagger. I don't want one for free or anything; I want to purchase it, but we're a little low on funds. The reason Tiberius needs to go to Kraghammer is because we're owed a large sum of money.
Matt: "Right, you mentioned this last time, when you almost opened a line of Gilmore's Glorious Credit."
Laura: Mm-hm. I'm not there.
Liam: What would the credit entail?
Matt: "Previously, we discussed 25,000 gold pieces, the amount of which you were going to retrieve."
Liam: I was going to-- what was that?
Matt: "Retrieve."
Liam: Retrieve? God, I've been in the Underdark so long. What was the deal?
Matt: "The deal was since you did not have funds, and you had to retrieve this money from this 'Dwarf Town', as you so graciously put it, that you would borrow the money, at the time, and then pay me back within a month. Within a month."
Liam: Understood.
Marisha: Wait, is Gilmore trying to say we owe him money?
Liam: No. We almost did that. Correct, DM? That's what we almost did, but we didn't do it. You offered it.
Matt: Correct. You backed out last minute when you realized there was, apparently, hidden platinum--
Liam: I would be interested-- Gilmore? I really just need a quick favor, and I mean to pay you back quickly. I need a dagger for something. Not your best dagger. Not your shittiest dagger, either. I just need something nice. How much would a fine dagger cost? Something that would be good in a fight. And could I pay you back in a couple of days, once Tiberius returns from Kraghammer?
Matt: "If you want something functional, there are masterwork daggers out there. We do have base-level enchantments that give you a fine, honed edge and a balance that cannot be beaten for its price range. For that, I can easily give you one of our base-level enchanted items for no more than, friend discount included, 400 gold pieces."
Taliesin: That's a pretty good deal.
Liam: Can I please purchase three of those?
Matt: "You may!"
Liam: Done.
Matt: "All right! I'll get these right now!" He stands up, and now that there's some sort of business involved, he's completely renovated and recharged. He comes through the beaded curtain again. You guys see Gilmore burst out, like, (laughs) "We're in business!" And he goes into the next room, and back up the stairs, and takes a few moments. He comes back down with an armful of these daggers, and sets them down on the counter. "Three for you! That'll be 1,200 gold pieces, please."
Liam: I reach out and I give his cheek a little bubby-squeeze, and I clap him on the cheek, and say, I'm good on my word, and you're a good friend. Thank you, Gilmore.
Matt: "The least I could do. Pay me back. I'll find you."
Liam: I know you're good on your word.
Matt: "Indeed."
Liam: Keyleth? Scanlan?
Sam: Oh, yes! How'd it go in there? You're walking straight, so it couldn't have gone too well.
Liam: Very good. Warm in here.
Taliesin: That dagger's so sharp, it could cut the sexual tension.
Orion: Those are masterwork daggers?
Matt: They are plus-one enchanted daggers, yes.
Sam: Well, let's get out of here and go. Did you find us any--?
Liam: I'm good. No, everything's good here. Just not everywhere else.
Sam: Let's get out of here, go back to the keep.
Matt: At this point, now, Tiberius, you have coasted over the air, and as you come careening in, you hear (swishing sounds) and look down. Two crossbow bolts whiz past you.
Orion: It's me, you idiots!
Matt: At which you hear immediately, "Oh, sorry!" "Sorry! We're not used to having you bolt in from the skyline."
Orion: I'm in a hurry, sorry! (whoosh)
Matt: As you sweep past Shayne and Cordell, they both change their bolts, and they're both arguing with each other, like, "You should've seen it was him!" "Sorry." "Sorry, again!" You make your way into the courtyard, inside Greyskull Keep.
Travis: Why'd you miss?
Orion: I go into, I rush in to find him eating. (stammers) Quickly, quickly! And I go into the Bag of Holding and I take the item out that we need. What was it?
Travis: Well, we have a bunch of stuff.
Matt: You're not with him, there.
Laura: I walk into the room to see Tiberius throwing things out of the Bag of Holding, I'm assuming.
Orion: I can't, because I have to visualize what it is to pull it out.
Travis: Yeah, what are you looking for?
Liam: I'm using my earring on the walk home. Does it work? I don't know what the range is. Tiberius, can you hear me? Tibs?
Matt: You're pretty out of range at this point.
Travis: What are you looking for, Tiberius?
Orion: I've taken my hand out. When we were in the Underdark and one of the items that we procured while we were scavenging, and we looted it, and we could give it back to the Thunderbrand.
Travis: Oh! Pieces of the enemy? We get paid for it.
Laura: But there were artifacts that they wanted. I remember.
Marisha: They wanted a necklace, right?
Orion: Yes. And we found one or two of them.
Marisha: Found a necklace, who was supposed to go-- hang on, I'm finding it, I'm looking.
Travis: I've got two gold necklaces, two gold chalices, and two rubies.
Matt: It was actually a magical item, one that you may have equipped. It'll say in the description of the item that it has an inscription on the back.
Orion: I don't have it.
Travis: I don't have that shit.
Sam: Whoa, what? It was a necklace we're talking about?
Matt: Protection of some kind, if I recall. Amulet.
Laura: Oh, I don't have that. (gasps) Oh no! What if we gave it to Kima?
Orion: We didn't give it to them.
Laura: But Kima took some armor we found!
Sam: "Amulet of Natural Armor?"
Matt: Look in the description of the item. It should say underneath the name. It'll have the actual inscription written in the descriptor of the item.
Travis: Everybody look at your stuff. I look inside my Belt of Dwarvenkind, and it says "Badass."
Marisha: It's a sapphire pendant that should say, "To Lorna, my love."
Laura: (gasps) Oh!
Orion: That's what I reach in and grab. There you go! Keyleth. I mean, your highness. I like your hair.
Marisha: Thank you!
Orion: It looks cool.
Marisha: Thanks!
Matt: It is enchanted.
Marisha: It's not the one you're wearing, right, Scanlan?
Laura: No, I remember we found it and nobody equipped it.
Travis: I had it in the bag, yeah.
Orion: I take it out, and I put it in mine. Grog, I'm finding out a way, as soon as I can show this to you, fellow. I'm going to go into Kraghammer very, very fast as opposed to slowly, and it is, so we should leave right now.
Laura: Can I go with you?
Orion: Yeah, and I'll cast-- because, who was around, just them two?
Matt: Just those two.
Orion: I cast Fly again at 3rd or 4th level, to cast on them.
Travis: I don't want to go!
Matt: Now, all of a sudden, you're (whoosh) lifted up in the air.
Orion: Yes, but we get there much faster if we fly. And I go.
Laura: And I take off after him!
Travis: What if I want to stay?
Orion: You can stay.
Travis: But I'm fucking floating above my meal! No! This is bullshit. And I'm bouncing off the ceiling and shit. Can I control myself?
Matt: You can. It takes a moment to adjust to it.
Travis: I just start trying to swim down to my plate.
Matt: It takes you a little bit, but you do eventually get control of it.
Travis: (eating noises) This isn't so bad. (farting noise)
Matt: Propulsion does work.
Laura: As we're flying, can I keep an eye out for our party members that are returning?
Matt: Yep. And as you guys coast over, you see, leaving the exterior wall gate to the south side of Emon, you see the rest of your party walking back towards the keep.
Laura: That means we're close enough. Brother!
Liam: Hello?
Laura: We're heading to the portal, Tiberius is working on something. We can get there faster! I'll be back soon.
Liam: Oh, all right. Gilmore has an in  he said we just need to mention his name and we're through. We can send Tiberius through.
Laura: Brilliant!
Orion: Ooh, that gives me a wonderful idea! And then, I'll cast it at 4th level again, and I'll go (pew-pew!) and cast it on--
Marisha: Just because I think it's funny-- Grog is flying over too, right?
Travis: I'm in that kitchen, floating around, farting and eating food. Look, I've got priorities.
Marisha: Okay, well, I see you guys are flying? The two of you?
Matt: So you fly down and cast Fly on the rest of them?
Orion: Right. Come on, follow me!
Liam: Holy shit, I've never flown before! This is amazing!
Sam: I'm flying, too? What's happening?
Matt: You guys are now floating. You guys are floating, as well. You're coasting over Emon for roughly 12 or so seconds before Grog, you drop to the ground, and now Tiberius and Vex, you begin to plummet.
Laura: Why are we plummeting?
Matt: Fly is a concentration spell. You cast it again. Your amulet keeps it up for two rounds, which is 12 seconds, and then the previous Fly spell deteriorates.
Orion: What about my circlet?
Matt: That's what I'm saying. The circlet lets you maintain concentration for two additional rounds.
Laura: Oh, okay! Tiberius, I'm falling!
Orion: I cast Fly again at 6th-level on everybody else.
Sam: I start falling.
Orion: No, because I can catch everybody.
Matt: At that point, now all of you guys are flying.
Orion: You fall in the kitchen, though.
Travis: Well, that makes sense.
Liam: Is this going to stick, Tiberius?
Orion: Yes. It's the same spell. I just really need a nap after this. I really need a nap after this. I go back to gather them all.
Matt: You make your way. Now, all of you following Tiberius, you coast down to the Alabaster Lyceum, landing right through the front area (whoosh), this whole party appears. Catch your feet, and there you see the same clerk looking up. "Ah, I see you've returned."
Orion: Yes. Can we not talk to the middle guy first? Can we go right to the last guy?
Matt: "Down that hallway. Follow it to the very end."
Orion: Thank you very much.
Matt: "You're welcome."
Orion: Follow me, everybody!
Matt: You all glide through the hallway, or walk, if you prefer. The end of the hallway, you open once again into the office, and there you see behind his desk once again, the headmaster Thurmond, who looks around. "Oh, yes. You've returned. I received the note from your friend Gilmore, and you're welcome to utilize one of our sigils."
Orion: Wonderful. That makes me quite happy.
Matt: "To Kraghammer, was it?"
Orion: Yes, but I do not want to use that favor for that sigil. I would like to call our friends, and I brought the item. I bring out the amulet. I want to show our friends in Kraghammer that we actually brought them the thing to get their permission to go on their sigil, and the other continent that we were on is called what?
Laura: Vasselheim?
Orion: Yes. The favor I would like for Gilmore is to get the Vasselheim sigil, please. But let's contact our friends at Kraghammer first.
Matt: "Two notes. There is no sigil in Vasselheim. They have been outlawed and destroyed to prevent arcane intrusion or subterfuge. There have been, historically, many a war's passed in which Vasselheim nearly fell to the sudden appearance of small armies within its walls, and as such, many of these sigils, all of them have been destroyed over the past 1,000 years. However, it was the third war--" And he's going into a long diatribe about the history of Vasselheim.
Laura: You are so educated. Perhaps we could talk later about all of this wonderful history.
Matt: "Certainly. Yes, I'm sorry. The mirror." He pulls up the mirror, pulls out his chest, brings out the same marble again, pops it into the mirror. It shimmers. "Hello? Hello?" You hear another voice say, "Oh, are you kidding me? Really? You again? All right, what are you bothering me with?"
Orion: Using my Mage Hand, I'm like, it's one of the things that you wanted us to get.
Laura: Who are you talking to?
Orion: I can see it. It's fine.
Matt: "What's it say? I can't read it from here. Read it out for me."
Orion: What does it say, Keyleth?
Marisha: To Lorna, with love. It's written right there, Tiberius.
Orion: Oh, sorry. To Lorna, with love.
Matt: At which point, you see the eyes of this dwarf that were very untrusting open wide for a second. "All right. Give him the sigil. Send him through. I'll see you soon." The mirror gives out again.
Laura: Oh, all of us?
Matt: No, the headmaster takes the mirror and puts it down. He points back to the clerk who's in the hallway behind you again, waiting, and says, "Go ahead and bring them to the Junction. Allow them access to the sigil for House Thunderbrand in Kraghammer." He nods. "Of course."
Orion: As he's doing this, I'm writing the sigil that I'm seeing forming in my--
Matt: He leads you to the Junction, and there is one of the doors he opens up on the inside, there is the actual sigil to Kraghammer there. He gives you some time to study it, you memorize it, you get it locked in, and you now permanently know the sigil of teleportation to Kraghammer within the House Thunderbrand.
Orion: Shall we go collect our money now?
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: We're all going? All of us?
Marisha: Well, I guess just the five of us, cause Grog and Percy are back at the Keep.
Sam: Would you rather just send Tiberius, then?
Laura: No, we should go.
Marisha: I can go back and check in on them.
Orion: Everybody's here but Grog.
Taliesin: And me.
Orion: Wait, where are you? Oh, you're working. Tinkering.
Liam: I have an errand to run.
Marisha: You have an errand to run? All right, I'll go with Vax--
Laura: It's the three of us, me and you and--
Orion: Okay. Thunderbrands are buttholes, though.
Sam: That's all right. That's why we're taking the heaviest hitters.
Marisha: Wait. We'll address that later. Come on, Vax.
Laura: Persuasion-wise.
Matt: So you guys head back to the Keep, you meet up with Grog and Percy, what about you guys? What're you doing? For, Tiberius, Scanlan, and Vex.
Laura: We go through.
Matt: Well, it's just the sigil. You have to cast the spell.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Oh.
Orion: Yeah. Is that what you want to do? Is that what's going on?
Sam: It's a spell?
Orion: Oh, shit. No, actually, I need to sleep. All that flying left me a bit exhausted.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: Sorcerers, they improvise.
Laura: Wait, you're saying that we cannot go through?
Orion: Well, hold on. Maybe there's a way I could trigger the spell?
Sam: Let's go home and go to sleep.
Orion: Let's get a drink, maybe? It's only been a day.
Marisha: You can cast that sigil anywhere, right? You don't have to be here? We could do it from home.
Laura: Then let's just fucking go home.
Orion: What time of the day is this? It's still afternoonish, right?
Matt: At this point in time, with all the travel back and forth, it's getting close to dusk.
Orion: Great.
Marisha: We'll take a nap and we'll go tomorrow. It's getting late, the Thunderbrands are probably going to bed at this point. We don't want to invade. They're probably just sitting down for dinner.
Sam: They live in the Underdark. There's no real time there.
Orion: My swallow's been crafted at the other place, right? Has that happened already?
Matt: Yeah, it's been crafted for you, yeah. It's not a swallow. It's a quarterstaff with knives attached.
Orion: I'm calling it swallow. On the way back, because we're obviously going to leave in the morning, to do stuff. I'd like to quickly stop at any blacksmith I see on the way back to Greyskull Keep.
Matt: Okay. Yeah, there are a couple blacksmiths that you know about on the way through.
Orion: Okay. I go to the good one, not the bad one, per reputation.
Matt: Best reputation is Karin, but she's a specialist. She's the one that made Trinket's--
Laura: Yeah, Karin!
Orion: I'll go to her, because she's awesome.
Matt: All right. You go on and approach there. She's currently working away on some custom piece that she's currently working on. She's like, "Hello, can I help you, dragonborn?"
Orion: Yes, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia; moreover, from Vox Machina--
Matt: "What can I help you with?"
Orion: Oh. Sorry, right. We've done business before. I would like to commission you. And as I'm doing this I'm taking out five of my daggers that I have, and I'm going to hand them to her. I would like to commission you to somehow craft these daggers into a type of bended glaive, if you would. I don't know how long it would take you to do so.
Matt: "What?"
Orion: You see, it's like, it would look like this, but it's--
Sam: Krull?
Orion: Yeah, totally, but the blades are bended, but they're all connected in the center. You could use an iron, or a steel ingot to connect the--
Matt: "I can certainly try, yeah, aye."
Orion: Wonderful!
Matt: "All right. It would take me about two days? And you've already supplied the material, other than a bit of the side bits. I'll say I'll charge you 100 gold pieces."
Orion: 100 gold pieces?
Matt: "Aye, I'm a specialist!"
Sam: You went to the good one.
Orion: What, that's all? I mean, oh yes, of course. Here's 120.
Matt: "Certainly. Thank you. All right, it should be done within the next two days. You're free to come by and check on it if you like, but it'll be done."
Orion: I trust your work. Trinket's armor was fantastic.
Matt: "Huh?"
Orion: Did she do that? I thought that was the same character.
Laura: This is Karin.
Sam: She just thought bear. She just knows bear.
Orion: Bear's armor. The bear's armor was--
Matt: "Oh! You're friends with that one? She was real nice. That bear was adorable. Happy to help with that one."
Orion: His name is Trinket.
Matt: "Oh, is that what it was?"
Orion: I'm surprised she didn't tell you. It's an adorable name.
Matt: "Probably had. It's just been a while."
Orion: This is Lockheed.
Matt: "Oh, you're so cute, Lockheed." You guys talk for a little bit and eventually make your way back.
Orion: I do business with her, and I go back to the keep.
Sam: Are we still waiting for him outside?
Matt: Yeah, you guys are right outside.
Sam: When he comes out, I cast Minor Illusion to make it look like I have a long gray beard. (laughter)
Sam: Can we go home now, please, Tiberius?
Orion: Yes. Sorry.
Sam: Any other stops you'd like to make? The dry-cleaners, perhaps?
Orion: Prestidigitation.
Sam: Oh, that's great. Now let's go night-night so you can cast a spell on us.
Matt: All right, you guys head back to the keep.
Liam: While they're doing that, I stealth away from the group.
Marisha: Can I do a passive perception check to see if I notice him sneaking away?
Orion: I would like to fart. Natural 20!
Sam: It's a huge fart.
Matt: Go ahead and roll perception.
Liam: I rolled a 32.
Marisha: Perception or passive perception?
Matt: For this, because it's not active? It would be your passive.
Marisha: Then that is 24.
Matt: Vax has vanished. While you might have noticed, instead the explosion-like eruption of gas from your dragonborn friend distracted you and gave him the proper getaway. You vanish.
Liam: Yeah, I'm totally down an alleyway, through the alley, onto another main thoroughfare. I grab a random person on the street. Excuse me, I'm looking for a specific butcher. Harold the butcher. Do you know? I think he's in the upper slums. Can you point me toward him?
Matt: The individual you stopped is a younger gentleman, probably in his mid-20s or so, a bit dirty in the face and coming from a day of work, going to the local tavern to finish his eve with some drinks. "I can't say I do. I mean, there are butchers all over town. There's one--"
Liam: Where's the upper slums? Upper slums, please.
Matt: "Oh, that would be north side of Emon. That way." He points you towards the--
Liam: I don't even say anything else. I just walk. I don't know how long that will take me.
Matt: It will take you about, from where you are right now, 30 minutes. All right, so you guys get back to the keep. Grog has eaten his fill.
Travis: I'm asleep on the table.
Matt: Yeah. Passed out. Percy's nowhere to be seen. You, I would like for you to make a tinkering roll in relation to the construction of ammunition.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Ten? You manage to, utilizing material for 20 bullets, only craft ten. But you get ten bullets out of it, as opposed to wasting the materials.
Orion: Is it possible to, before I go to sleep, I have a basic poison potion I've been hoarding. Could I try to dip the tip of one of my bolts in that?
Matt: You can certainly try. There's a difference between poison and disease. They're different. The potion seems to have no effect.
Orion: On bolts?
Matt: It doesn't have any effect.
Taliesin: How many batches of bullets are you going to let me attempt to make?
Matt: For the day, that's what you spent making. Tomorrow, we'll get to whatever it is you want to craft then. You go off and manage to make your way to the upper slums.
Liam: Yes. I see a stunted old woman and stop her on the street and say, Grandmother. I'm looking for Harold the butcher. Do you know where I can find him?
Matt: "Best I can gather, he'd be around that way." She points you, and the breath is awful. She's missing teeth, but her crooked finger curves off to the side, and you can see across the way, next to a homestead or hovel, there is a very humble-looking butcher that is currently in the process of closing shop.
Liam: I'd like to go stealth. I rolled a 20.
Matt: All right. You make your way up there. You can see there's an older gentleman in his mid-40s or so, salt-and-pepper hair, black with a bit of gray on the sides, is currently in the process of closing up.
Liam: Do I see Kynan anywhere? No? And it's a home? It's a business and a home?
Matt: It's hard to tell. It looks like a business from this perspective.
Liam: Okay, I'd like to go around the back of the building and scope it out.
Matt: You look through the windows. There's a dull light on the inside from what looks like a small hooded lantern set up for a bit of interior light, but there's nobody else in the house.
Liam: There's nobody in? I'd like to, at the window, listen and use perception to see if I can tell if anyone's inside.
Matt: You listen for a while. Make a perception roll.
Liam: Yeah, that's 25.
Matt: All right. As you continue to listen, eventually you hear the slamming of wood. You look off, and through the bit of the glass window-- you're peeking from the side-- you see the same gentleman who was closing the shop enter the room where the hooded lantern is. There's a table. He sits down quietly for a second, looks at the lamp, starts cleaning his fingernails a little bit, gives a big sigh, and turns off the light of the lantern and exits the room, closing the door behind him.
Liam: Is it one floor, the building?
Matt: It's one floor.
Liam: It's one floor. Is the window locked?
Matt: You checked the window. It's not locked.
Liam: All right, I'm climbing in.
Matt: You slip in without a problem. You've done this many times before.
Liam: It's a family residence where Kynan lives. Are there bedrooms?
Matt: It's hard to tell, looking around the room here. There are three doors that exit. One that he came through, which is apparently from the front of the butcher shop. This appears to be a central room that connects to wherever else he walked. There are two other doors.
Liam: They're not trapped, are they?
Matt: They're not trapped.
Liam: So I'm going to crouch down and push open the first door. What do I see?
Matt: The door immediately right or the door in front of you? The door in front of you is the one that the man traveled through.
Liam: Oh, no. Not that one. There were two other doors, weren't there?
Matt: There's the door that he came in from when he sat down, and then he left through the door across the way from you, and there is a door that been unopened.
Liam: There's one other door? That's the one.
Matt: Okay. You push open the door very quietly. It makes a little creaking sound, but you stop. Peering inside, it's dark. There appears to be a bed. There's a small table. There's what looks like an old pair of boots that are worn out on the side. It looks like a bedroom that nobody's currently in.
Liam: And there's no sign that this is a youth's bedroom or father's bedroom? What can I glean from what I see in here?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: I'm going to use Luck. That's better. 22.
Matt: Okay. You take a little bit of time in peering over the materials, looking at the bed size, looking at the boot size, looking at whatever you can nearby. This bed is definitely weathered. It's been used for a long time. There are a couple of small knick-knacks and toys that are discarded underneath that have been there for a while that lead you to believe that this was at one point a boy's room. However, what you do notice is that most of the materials, most of the belongings, anything that you would normally see in a boy's room, anything that would say that a person lives here seem to have been hastily grabbed and taken off.
Liam: And the father went out the other way? All right, so I creep back out the window and I go out the front and I knock really loud on the front door.
Matt: A couple moments later, a voice comes from the other side. "Hello?"
Liam: Hello. I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you. I know you've closed up shop.
Matt: "I'm done for business for the day. Come back tomorrow."
Liam: I'm actually not looking to buy anything. I owe your son a bit of money. I lost some money in a wager we made on a dog fight, and I was hoping to reimburse him. Do you know where he is?
Matt: The door opens a little bit, and an eye peeks through. You gather there's a slight scent of alcohol from the other side as he starts talking. He says, "I don't know where my son's gone off to. He came in in a huff. We got in an argument. He grabbed his stuff and left. He does this every now and then. He'll be back."
Liam: You think he'll be back?
Matt: "This isn't the first time he's done this."
Liam: I want to leave something with you.
Matt: "You said it was money you owed him?"
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "I can give that to him."
Liam: I take 50 gold of what I have left and I leave it with him, and I take out three daggers. I can hear my sister's voice in the back of my head. I want to use insight on him to make sure he's trustworthy. Oh, that's good. That's 20.
Matt: Okay. There's something about his face that gives you the feeling that he's more interested in the contents of what you're leaving than actually transferring these to the intended recipient.
Liam: Just give him the 50 gold. Thank you. And I leave.
Matt: Okay. Closes the door behind you, you hear a lock. Light goes back out in the room.
Sam: Go in there and kill him. Kill him, shit on his bed, and leave.
Liam: I head back to the keep.
Matt: Okay. All right, eventually Vax finds his way back to the keep. The rest of you are there, at rest for the evening. Is there anything else you want to accomplish before the night's out?
Marisha: I just flipped through my book on the alchemy section for a bit.
Matt: All right. You all find yourself to bed for the evening, rest up for the next morning, and at that point we're going to go ahead and take our break. Five minutes, guys, a strict five minutes because we still have a lot to get through. A lot to get through tonight, don't want to stay late.
Liam: Another nine hours.
Matt: No. See you guys in about five minutes, quick restroom break. We'll be right back. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, from our very strict, very strict five-minute break. We're very good at that. Yeah. That's right. Couple quick things. First off, we just hit 7,500 subscribers! (cheering)
Matt: That's amazing for many reasons. But all of you who are currently watching, be active in the chatroom so you can be included in the next giveaway we're doing. Giveaway's going to include a signed picture of the cast, a signed poster by the cast of the amazing art of our fantastic artist, Kit Buss.
Taliesin: Maybe signed by Kit.
Sam: She's amazing.
Matt: Yeah. So please be active in the chatroom, be part of that giveaway when it gets put out, and thank you guys so much for being so amazing and getting us to that point that's--
Liam: Yeah! You 7,500 people, fucking thank you, man. Thank you.
Travis: But only you 7,500. The rest can fuck off.
Matt: That was in character. All right, cool. Let's get back and see if we can, see if we can roll through some of this stuff. As you wake the next morning, you guys awaken to the dull sound of metal clanging as Percy has already been the first to wake and is back in the workshop. Tiberius, you're well-rested. Everyone's spells have returned. You get to make a beard roll.
Travis: Beard check, please! Three. Five.
Matt: 35? What? Bundlesofkittens, by the way, won. Congratulations to bundlesofkittens. Going to get prizes.
Laura: Adorable.
Matt: 35% does count. As you wake up, you reach up and feel the return of a nice hefty bit of scruff to your chin. Yeah, it's getting pretty thick now. It's a good, like, half an inch to an inch length. And you're starting to get a little, you notice the first time you grew some facial hair it was coming through that weird, creepy translucent color? It's starting to come through with a proper, almost a dark red-brown color to it.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Got a little bit of the Irish thing going on.
Travis: I don't know, I might have to get a cage; the women are going to come running.
Matt: So as you all gather for breakfast, you get your fill, a fine breakfast awaits you, already prepared by your servants of the Greyskull Keep. What do you wish to do?
Travis: Good morning, Vox Machina. Lovely to see all of you.
Marisha: So Grog, you fell asleep in your plate of food and woke up with a beard.
Travis: I know. Some guys are just lucky. (laughter)
Taliesin: Have we checked to make sure it's not a stain?
Travis: Hey, fuck off with your stinging, burning shit, all right? I'm not putting anything else in water. I don't know if you know, Scanlan, but water burns.
Laura: Good job, Percy, now he's never going to bathe.
Taliesin: You may have taken the wrong lesson away from that.
Travis: No, I pretty much got it. In, burn, ouch, powder.
Orion: You're not a chinchilla, Grog, which is a small creature that bathes itself in dust. But you are a human, which water is good.
Travis: I'm not a human.
Orion: Well, you are a humanoid. Which is, water is good. Which, most of you is water.
Travis: (gasps) You always drink water when we drink. Does it burn?
Orion: No, it feels rather--
Sam: Let's get going.
Taliesin: He does breathe fire.
Orion: I'm feeding Lockheed some of my breakfast.
Matt: Certainly. Lockheed enjoys the breakfast. Lockheed is looking healthier. The color is a little more of a deep emerald green, and he appears to have a little more energy this morning.
Sam: Does it shit on your shoulder?
Matt: He hasn't noticed, but there is a slight streak of dried pseudo-dragon poo. You're not aware of it to cast that yet.
Taliesin: Methinks the DM doth speak from experience.
Matt: As a bird owner, he does.
Orion: I'm going to, I rolled, I'm going to do a roll for the day, I think I rolled one for the day, and I'm going to go: Staht. Staht. And I'm going to, I rolled a 14 to try to teach it to sit. Staht.
Matt: (lizard noises) It sits down on the edge of the table.
Orion: And I give it a treat. Krar, Krar, there you go.
Matt: Bites your finger.
Orion: As it's hanging, I put it on my shoulder.
Matt: (lizard noises) It sits there.
Marisha: They get nippy. It's in the breed.
Matt: So! What do you want to do?
Sam: We want to get out of here. Cast the thing. Let's go.
Orion: As I'm having my oatmeal and such, I start to cast.
Marisha: I still think maybe the more talkative members of the group should go?
Sam: Still want to split the party?
Taliesin: I'm staying home, anyway
Marisha: I'm checking in with Tiberius-- oh sorry, Percy.
Matt: At which point the teleportation sigil appears in the center of the floor the way Tiberius had prepared it. It's glowing right now.
Travis: I've got the creature bits so I should go, too.
Laura: You! Take care of my bear, I'm leaving him here with you.
Liam: All right. I got him.
Laura: Oh, Trinket! I love you so.
Matt: Trinket comes up and like rubs his nose against your coat.
Laura: Behave, all right?
Liam: I'm going to feed you so much chocolate.
Laura: That's really bad for him! Don't!
Marisha: It'll be fine.
Matt: The sigil's starting to spark--
Sam: I jump in.
Travis: I jump in, too.
Matt: Okay, so all of you who are going, you leap in. You're staying and you're staying, correct? And you're staying. All right, Keyleth, Percy and Vax. All of you guys step in and all of a sudden there's a familiar whoosh of some sort of dark transference, you feel as if gravity for a moment doesn't exist and your feet find purchase on some sort of a wooden floor. The room is dark. You glance about the immediate vicinity, and for those of you who have low light, there's very little you can actually make out other than the fact this is a basement of some kind, and you are amidst a bunch of sheet covered crates.
Orion: Light! (whoosh)
Matt: As the light fills the room, you look around.
Orion: I cast it on Lockheed. On his tail.
Matt: All right! Lockheed begins trying to shake the light off the tail, so it moves around a little bit.
Orion: Oh, Bensvelk! That means "good" in Draconian. Bensvelk. And I feed him a treat.
Matt: (chuckles) All right! You look around the room, there are about six or seven of these crates immediately visible to you. They have sheets put over them, they're different sizes, some sort of storage room. There is a staircase that leads to the floor above.
Laura: Wait. Do they know we're coming? We're just in the middle of their home now?
Orion: Yes, of course, Vex, they know we're coming. I showed them the amulet, it was how we got the sigil to come here to begin with. It's fine. We're doing business with them. It'll be good.
Laura: Can I perception and make sure there's no traps around us? Just to make sure. We're just popping in, and this is a magic house, am I right? So I can't check for traps worth shit.
Matt: Room looks safe!
Laura: Great. Good. Great.
Travis: Well, good. Let's get out of here.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way to the second floor. As you step up to the top you can see there is light emanating from the top of the staircase and a figure moves into the staircase. A stout dwarven figure. This is the same individual you spoke to previously. The dwarf steps to the top and says, with an air of annoyance to the voice. "All right. Waited up all night for you to arrive, and you never did. And you come here and interrupt my breakfast."
Orion: I'm sorry. We thought you would like a night's sleep before we intrude and--
Matt: "It's fine, step up the stairs, please." and he steps out of the way, leads you into the central chamber. This house is unfamiliar to all but Scanlan, who turned invisible suddenly and decided to wander in briefly.
Sam: Yes, I did. My old stomping grounds.
Matt: The classic "I don't know!" Looking about it's very well-kept. It's an old house; the ceilings are taller than you expect for a dwarf type home. A lot of the ceilings are a little low especially for you Grog, this one's built roomy. There's actually a lot of cultivated cave plant life, a lot of boxes that contain various underground dwelling plants and other such funguses. The air itself is mixtures of sweet and pungent. Mixed almost as if there's a spice garden somewhere, and you're not really able to take a beat on what the actual interior would smell like, it keeps changing around you. You're brought to the main foyer area, and the dwarf turns back and he says "All right, you've made your transference. Where's the amulet?"
Orion: I'll open the Bag of Holding. And I'll take it out. Before I actually go over and speak, I'm going to turn to Scanlan and Vex. Is he the same person who pays us for the other--
Laura: No. I should probably go find that guy. Or we can go all together.
Orion: I just didn't want to say the wrong thing this time.
Sam: Sure, don't worry. You will.
Orion: Oh, sorry. Here is the amulet. And I show him. Now, as far as trade, as it was rather taxing to procure this particular artifact--
Laura: Incredibly difficult, he means to say.
Orion: Yes, she's correct. I was wondering if we could, perchance, trade it for a favor of your arcane ability?
Matt: "It's funny, because I already did. I gave you a permanent entry to my own household, my family's household, by offering you this sigil, that gave you entrance to the interior of our well-guarded estate. That was a trade enough. That was what we agreed upon through the mirror."
Orion: That was just to get me here quicker, I thought.
Matt: "So you come into my home and try to extort me?"
Orion: No, not at all! Here's what happened, see. We were on an adventure-- I pull out the carpet out of my Bag of Holding. And this carpet was enchanted once with the ability to fly, and it helped us many times in many adventures. It was de-chanted, I guess, if you want to say it. And we need it re-chanted. And I thought that House Thunderbrand would be a strong enough house to have the ability to do such a thing. Maybe not as it seems. And I hand him the amulet as I'm saying this.
Matt: He takes the amulet.
Orion: And not as a trade, but as a favor for just the effort, or maybe because I'm not strong enough as a sorcerer myself to do it.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: People speak very, very highly of your abilities. Can I assist him?
Matt: It's not going to matter. You keep talking, and as you're explaining this, he's not even paying attention to you. The dwarf is staring at the amulet, looking at the back of it where the inscription is. And you swear for a minute, you see what looks like a tear, gathering in the corner of the eye of the dwarf, who then reaches up and wipes it from the corner and takes the amulet and puts it in the pocket and says, "My apologies. Thank you for returning this. You were talking about the carpet, right?"
Laura: Yes.
Orion: Yes.
Matt: "You want it to be enchanted?"
Laura: Well, we've heard very wonderful things about your abilities and not many people can do such a feat.
Matt: "We have done a carpet before. Only one. It's very possible."
Laura: Did it look anything like this one?
Matt: "Not this pattern, no, that one was more of a blue. I mean this can be enchanted, but the materials and the time put into it-- It's a very pricey endeavor. A carpet of this size, especially."
Sam: How much?
Matt: "We're looking at the better part of a year to enchant this and that'll cost you about, time included, that'll cost 50,000 gold pieces."
Laura: Oh my god! I throw my hands up. I just can't. I just can't! How did we not? Oh my god.
Sam: She's very fond of the carpet.
Travis: I put my arm around Vex and try and console her.
Laura: 50? A year! Why?! Thank you so much.
Matt: "Well I mean, there might be smaller ones you might be able to find elsewhere."
Laura: No, I know it's a really beautiful carpet, and it would cost a lot of money to fix up, I understand.
Sam: She loves the hand-woven carpets. It's just very tragic.
Matt: "All right, well--"
Travis: Shall we go get our money now?
Sam: Yes, who's the man we need to see about that?
Laura: Oh, that's the Kraghammer-- We go to see--
Liam: Johnny Kraghammer?
Laura: Johnny Kraghammer.
Sam: Nostoc Greyspine?
Laura: It was Greyspine.
Matt: Nostoc Greyspine. You're escorted out of the House Thunderbrand. Make your way down to the quarry, at the very bottom level of Kraghammer, once again. It's been a long time since you've been in this portion of the world, let alone this city, where you started this leg of your entire journey. You do make your way down into this area to Lord Nostoc Greyspine's proper office, the one where you managed to procure his expensive wine and make this venture the very beginning. You step into the familiar halls. As soon as you enter, you have a brief discussion with the guy at the front, who recognizes you and leads you into the office. There, waiting, behind his desk is Nostoc, who's currently in the process of looking out the window over the entire quarry of his mine. He turns over his shoulder, looking at the rest of you. "Well, I'm surprised to see you all alive. Just assumed you'd all got yourselves killed, like the usual bumpkins who come wandering this far down in the mountain."
Laura: No. We did not die. We, in fact, succeeded in taking care of those creatures. Under-- dark-- carpet.
Sam: She's-- That time of the month.
Laura: Oh! Excuse me. We came to collect the money you owed us for completing the mission you sent us on.
Matt: "Ah yes, of course. Of course. Understood. What was the price we had agreed for that one?"
Laura: Oh, it was 30,000 gold, plus all the extras for the scalps that we acquired.
Travis: I open the bag of holding and go, Here, here's one brain chunk. And I dump it on the floor.
Matt: As a note, I'm pretty sure at practically no point in your adventure to the Underdark did you ever say you were scalping a creature.
Liam: We're above base--
Marisha: We totally forgot about that.
Matt: You completely, in the entirety of that adventure, didn't collect a single scalp from anything you killed.
Travis: I thought I grabbed the brain chunk. I thought I grabbed an arm, too. There was just an arm from the stitched guy, and I just grabbed it.
Liam: An arm is not a scalp. It's this.
Matt: Nostoc also looks at you and goes, "And while I respect your memory, a dwarf's mind is like a trap that you can't escape. I believe the agreed upon price was 25,000 gold pieces."
Laura: Oh it was? That is so weird, I remember 30.
Matt: "I don't even know what you fought. If you're going to collect your money, tell me what the hell you freaking killed."
Laura: Mind flayers! A beholder! Have you heard of a beholder?
Matt: "You fought a beholder?"
Laura: We fought a fucking beholder.
Matt: "Really? And you're all still alive?"
Sam: Well no, not all of us. If you'll recall there were more of us when we came down here. And some of us aren't here because they died.
Travis: I start pretending to cry.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Laura: That's really good.
Sam: 21.
Laura: I start thinking about the carpet and I really do start crying.
Sam: So before you berate us, know that we are mourning the loss of two of our members. And a bear!
Laura: (sobbing) And my bear!
Matt: "Beholder, you say?"
Laura: It was really big.
Matt: "What else did you encounter?"
Laura: Illithid.
Sam: Lots of illithid. A whole city of illithid.
Matt: "A whole city of illithid?"
Laura: We destroyed half of an elder brain-- Part of an elder brain.
Travis: And there were all these dark--
Laura: Dwarves! There were dark dwarves. Duergar.
Sam: They were mind controlled. It was crazy, we're not just making this up. It really happened.
Travis: There were these wrinkled testicles that were walking around on feet.
Laura: He almost died! Just from this one little brain.
Travis: Strange thing. If you're stupid, and it looks at you with its wrinkled testicle face? You go unconscious.
Matt: "I know the creatures you speak of. I've dealt with my share of duergar, though--"
Orion: I completely stayed away from it, because I was terrified.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Liam: (singing) Roll high!
Laura: Are we all rolling? Because we're all talking.
Matt: You were spearheading that part of the group.
Laura: I was? I thought Scanlan was.
Matt: Scanlan already made his roll.
Travis: What about giving her advantage because I was talking about testicles?
Matt: No testicle advantage on that roll. I'm sorry.
Liam: In what circumstance would testicle advantage come into play?
Sam: At Gilmore's.
Laura: That would be 11.
Matt: 11? "Looking at your number, I can see that you've certainly encountered some dangerous things in your travels, taken some losses. And I will say, since you've left, we haven't had at least one excursion interrupting our mine, which has been very helpful. The fact that you've returned with these tales-- I believe most of it. I'd say, given that circumstance, I'd be happy to pay you up to 18,000 gold pieces."
Sam: I am going to cast Suggestion on him.
Laura: 18,000 gold in addition to the--
Travis: He's casting.
Liam: He's doing it!
Matt: So what's the DC? You don't have your hand cone.
Sam: I don't have my hand cone out. 17.
Matt: Natural one.
Laura: Money!
Matt: All right, what are you suggesting?
Sam: I'm going to suggest to him that he is an honorable man and we had a deal. And that he should honor it, to the fullest extent of the word.
Matt: He looks about at the rest of you guys.
Sam: I also, as a cantrip-- oh god, I hope it's not concentration. Forget it. I'm not going to.
Matt: "The Greyspine name holds weight in this city, the last thing I want is that that be sullied by miscommunication. If we agreed to 25,000, I'll pay 25,000. But I hear a single disagreement out there, or a bad word that came from your lips about our exchange here, and I'm going to come for the rest of that money."
Travis: I hold up the duergar's severed arm, and I curl all the fingers in and make a thumbs-up like that.
Matt: He looks back at you, very slowly, as you do this, with a tense stare. (laughs) "All right, all right." And he starts bringing up coin purse, after coin purse, after coin purse, counting it up as he does. It takes him about five minutes or so, and eventually he counts out, at your vision to improve it, 25,000 gold pieces and platinum pieces and pushes it across to you guys. You've retrieved that. No additional funds, as no scalps were collected, but you do get 25,000.
Travis: Do you want the--
Matt: "You can hold onto that, thank you."
Travis: You're very gracious.
Laura: (singing) 25,000 gold in my hands right now. Thank you so much. This won't make up for the lost lives we have suffered, but-- (choking up) It helps.
Matt: "I'm glad. And I'm sorry for your losses. Perhaps you'll be less stupid in the future."
Travis: Probably not. We should go.
Sam: Remember the blood we spilled for your people and your safety.
Laura: Vox Machina! (laughter)
Sam: Oh! I go to give him a business card, but then I realize I never got them printed so.
Laura: Also! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Great work.
Sam: Yes, Gilmore's! If you're ever overdark, come check it out. It's a great store.
Matt: Like an unexpected web pop-up, he gives you an expression of: where is this coming from? "Get out! Get out of my office!"
Travis: Tiberius, how do we get out of here quickly?
Orion: I start going back to the chamber and I'll do the spell again.
Sam: Can you do it again? Don't you have to rest?
Matt: You can do it twice? 6th-level spell twice?
Orion: No it's a 5th-level spell.
Matt: What? The teleportation?
Orion: Yeah, it's a 5th-level spell.
Matt: I think it is. You're right.
Orion: Yes, very well. And then we'll go back to-- I'll choose Emon.
Liam: Excuse me? As soon as they left, Trinket and I, we left, and I went to the nearest shop and bought a lot of pink ribbon, and I have been furiously tying bows all through Trinket's hair, the entire time they've been gone.
Marisha: Actually I'll help with that campaign. I do some braids, and add some flowers.
Liam: Keyleth has been weaving flowers in, and I have been knotting braids. Started at the head, and then worked all the way down Trinket's back and down the tail. The entire time. Feverishly.
Taliesin: I come up for lunch. Keyleth, can I borrow you for a-- what in good god?!
Marisha: Is it important? Do you need me right now? This is pretty important.
Taliesin: Is Trinket comfortable with this?
Marisha: He's so comfortable! Look, I gave him plenty of treats, he doesn't even know what's happening.
Matt: (sad bear noises) This mournful low, guttural groan. You're pretty sure it translates to, "Why?"
Liam: I feed him a piece of chocolate at that moment.
Laura: Don't give him chocolate!
Matt: He licks it off.
Taliesin: Keyleth, can I borrow you? When you have a moment.
Marisha: Ten more minutes. I'll be down in ten minutes.
Matt: It takes about ten minutes before the keep doors open and the rest of your party returns.
Marisha: And I run downstairs really fast.
Liam: Side note, I let Trinket give me bear-kisses all over my face. Vex never lets Trinket kiss her face, and it's so sad, and I let him just drool all over my face everywhere.
Taliesin: I feel like we're playing out some real-world psychodrama here.
Orion: As this is going on, I want to turn to Scanlan and go, Gnome. I have an idea that I want to run by you. No, your name's Scanlan. Okay. I was going to go and do this, just on a whim as I usually do, but I was thinking that we should speak to Allura, and I don't think I should speak to her alone.
Sam: I'm sorry. I must be asleep. Are you planning something? Ahead of time.
Orion: Yes.
Sam: Wow. That's amazing!
Orion: You know. Like I told Vax, you just have to chill out sometimes, and I'm like, well, maybe I should run it by the man with the mouth.
Sam: Well, you've come to the right place. I do have quite a mouth. Yes, let's go talk to her. Wait, she's the woman you fancy quite a bit, isn't that true?
Orion: Yes. This is more business rather than denied pleasure.
Sam: What do you want to speak with her about?
Orion: Well, as far as I see it, there's no other way to get our carpet reenchanted. I want to confess what we did to her, and hopefully she takes mercy and helps us out with this, as we've helped her out far beyond anything that--
Matt: At this point in the discussion, you guys all look up and see, sitting in the center of the main foyer area of Greyskull, a very mighty bear, brought down low, sitting covered in pink ribbons, looking forward, going (distressed bear noises)
Sam: See? I told you it was a girl!
Laura: Trinket! You look so cute.
Marisha: Oh, I knew she'd love it!
Laura: We need to get these off of you immediately. But you look really, really cute. And I scratch his little ears. How dare--
Matt: You look over, too, there are traces of chocolate smears across the face of Vax.
Orion: Vex. No, Vex. Yes. Stand over-- and I use my Still Image and take a little spell of her--
Taliesin: Say it. Staffie. Just say staffie.
Orion: No, but it's of her, it's a youie.
Travis: But it's with your staff.
Liam: What is the piece of art immortalized upon? A piece of wood?
Orion: Oh. And I open my Scroll of Telescription, I'm like, see?
Laura: Oh look, now I can remember this moment forever. Thank you. Trinket, let's go get you a bath.
Travis: We got so much money.
Laura: I go and put it in the party funds. We got our gold.
Sam: Good job. We can pay back Gilmore.
Liam: For my share? Just my share.
Laura: Are we splitting up all the party gold now?
Orion: Vex? I give her the picture. Now you have a picture of your bear with the silly bows.
Laura: Oh, thank you.
Liam: And I take advantage of her good mood and say, I just want 1,200 gold, and I won't ask for any more of it, any of the amount.
Orion: Ooh, yes, I would like the same thing.
Laura: Do you want me to just split up all the party gold right now?
Sam: No, I don't, no. Just give us a quick stipend. Give us each 1,500 and let's move on.
Laura: Everybody gets 1,500. Is everybody happy? Trinket, are you just so thrilled?
Matt: (sad bear noises) He's pulling them out with his claws as best he can.
Laura: Oh, sweetie. Bath time.
Matt: Trinket stands up and heads out to the front courtyard. All right, so it's 1,500 times seven.
Laura: I'll do the math.
Sam: Let's go do our recon. Who's doing it?
Travis: Are we going to kill them?
Sam: No, we're just going to go spy on them.
Taliesin: I'd like to finish my morning crafting before moving into the evening crafting. I'm going to have help. I'm working on project number three.
Matt: Okay. This is probably going to take you the rest of the week. It's an extensive project.
Taliesin: If I have a little help? This is something I've been tinkering with for quite a while, now.
Matt: Right, but it's also the most complicated thing, outside of the gun, that you've constructed.
Travis: We've got a couple more days, too.
Orion: How many days have passed, since we've been doing this? Two?
Liam: Percy, you go to work. We'll figure out everything else.
Matt: It's up to you.
Taliesin: Do you think I'll have time to finish everything that's on my list, if I roll well?
Matt: Probably not everything. You'll have to choose between a couple.
Liam: What if he rolls a 20?
Taliesin: Because I was going to have Keyleth lightning spell to help set the battery for the--
Matt: Right. Well, that is technically an enchantment.
Taliesin: If it just uses it to start a charge?
Matt: Oh, to start a charge? Then you can do it.
Taliesin: Okay. Yeah, I was going to Frankenstein this.
Matt: Okay. We can begin the roll now.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Go ahead and make a tinkering roll.
Taliesin: That's better. 20.
Matt: 20, okay. Not actually doing the charge yet, because you're building the basis of the structure. You help him downstairs in his workshop with the various materials to begin crafting the actual shell of the the item. What else are you guys doing?
Sam: Let's go do recon.
Liam: Yeah, what are we checking out, though? I mean, it's not like the Briarwoods are out in public. We don't know anything about them.
Laura: We need to ask around town about the Briarwoods.
Sam: We need to get into the Briarwoods' estate and talk to them.
Marisha: Well, they're not local. They're coming into town. They're coming into town in five to seven days.
Matt: No, they're arriving now in six days and arriving for the actual feast.
Sam: Where's the feast to be held?
Matt: It's to be held in the palace.
Laura: Shit. We can't do any spying.
Marisha: Not on them.
Orion: All we can do is get gear and do things and we can sleep for a few days.
Taliesin: You can help me in the workshop.
Marisha: Make a plan. Maybe make a plan? We don't really have a plan.
Liam: Can you remind me and the group, the dinner, I know it's with the Briarwoods, but who else? Is it with Uriel or who is it with?
Matt: It's with Uriel, the Council, which is why you guys were invited, also because Percy asked. And the Briarwoods. It is partially to discuss and celebrate the agreed-upon construction of a bridge that goes across the Shearing Channel at the far northeastern side of the continent of Tal'Dorei. There is a large channel where these two large mountain ranges, which are the closest the two continents are to each other, but it's a very treacherous pass of water, so any trade having to be done has had to travel southward, in a big arc around the bottom of the island, or via skyship, both very expensive. This bridge will enable a much faster trade route between the two continents, and Whitestone has essentially been in charge of spearheading the construction of this bridge and making this agreement with Uriel, that would be overall helpful for both continents. And since they've agreed upon this, they've been invited here to Emon for the first time to have dinner with the Council and Uriel to celebrate it.
Liam: We maybe want to talk to Uriel.
Laura: Maybe. Maybe you guys should go, because I want to spend the next few days training Trinket how to roly-poly roll forward and bludgeon people with his armor.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Marisha: I mean, the only thing I can think-- Percy. Do you still have an idea of what the Briarwoods look like?
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Marisha: I could attempt another scrying spell. Could even possibly go to Allura for help and try again.
Taliesin: See if Allura will come here, because I want to keep working. And I'll also say we should send word to Uriel that I will not be myself at the--
Sam: Yes, that might be very strange.
Laura: We should maybe send word to him that the Briarwoods should be watched.
Taliesin: The less we say, the better.
Marisha: What makes you say that?
Liam: You think Uriel might be in the Briarwoods' pocket and pass on that we're aware.
Taliesin: It would not be the first time.
Liam: That's true.
Sam: Yes, even if you wear this disguise hat, Percy, how are you going to get into this event? It's a private event. You can't just be some random person.
Taliesin: I will be with you, and if we can let Uriel know that I am coming under a false pretense.
Sam: Yeah, but that's going to arouse all kinds of suspicion.
Marisha: Exactly, yeah, if we tell Uriel you're coming as someone else, he's going to ask why.
Taliesin: He knows that I don't trust them.
Travis: He does?
Taliesin: He does.
Marisha: Wait, who was it that came and talked to us? Who was that?
Matt: That was Seeker Asum.
Marisha: I was going to say, it was Seeker Asum, but he didn't say that Uriel had his doubts, he said he had his doubts.
Taliesin: So let's let Asum know.
Marisha: Let Asum know.
Sam: Why don't you disguise yourself as--
Taliesin: Burt Reynolds.
Sam: What about Vax? He can sneak in.
Taliesin: Will the hat let me choose who I look like?
Matt: The hat, like any Minor Illusion spell, you can choose your appearance.
Taliesin: How much of a shape-change can I--
Matt: I mean, you can look pretty close to somebody else.
Taliesin: Could I look like Grog?
Matt: You could. But as it is an illusion, there is no physical-- so if somebody were to reach up and touch your shoulder, it would just pass through.
Marisha: Right, and your voice doesn't change, so you probably don't want to try and sound like Grog all night.
Taliesin: Well, I was actually thinking of Pike, but.
Sam: Ooh, Pike. You could be Pike. You would be a very big Pike.
Liam: Percival, there's nothing I want more than for you to take Bad News and unload it on every one of those motherfucking shits, but if you're me and I'm nobody, if I'm a ghost, I can help take out one or two.
Taliesin: You'll stick to the shadows, and I'll be you.
Marisha: Not to be-- sorry, you were going to say something?
Taliesin: No, that's actually a pretty good plan.
Liam: How many days left?
Matt: Six.
Liam: Can I ask you a question, DM? I have in the assassin perks. I think it says seven days, I can be anybody. As long as I don't do anything else and I work on getting the right papers, and no one will know who I am, 100%, but it's six days, so am I shit out of luck? This is why I was talking about it yesterday, motherfuckers.
Taliesin: That's okay. It's a good plan. I think this plan is a good plan.
Orion: I think we'll be fine, because I have privilege perk.
Liam: You make me invisible.
Sam: I can also do that. Or he can.
Liam: Yeah, one of you two.
Sam: No problem. I know it's a few days off, but we should have some sort of safe word. Some sort of attack word. Grog, any suggestions?
Travis: Jenga.
All: Jenga.
Marisha: I like that. We're not hired to kill the Briarwoods, and not to be that member of the group that has a golden heart and wants to ruin everyone's fun. I don't want to stand between you and your revenge that you are absolutely owed, Percy, but are you sure this is what you want? Is this going to make you feel better?
Taliesin: I don't know what I want. I want to see them. I want to look at them. I want to see them.
Marisha: Do you want to talk to them?
Taliesin: No. I want to listen to them.
Travis: Then we follow your lead.
Taliesin: I want to see them. I don't know.
Marisha: Do you want us to fucking capture them and drag them back to the cell that we built in our keep? We built it for a reason.
Sam: (whistles) She gambles now. She's crazy.
Marisha: I know, I've been opened up to so many things.
Taliesin: The best I can give you is we'll just have to see what happens.
Liam: Percival, I trust you implicitly. You have earned that trust. Do you believe them to be evil in the purest sense?
Taliesin: I do.
Laura: That's all we need.
Liam: That's all we need.
Sam: We don't even need that much. If you'd just said to kill someone, we'd probably do it.
Taliesin: I saw things.
Laura: Should we prepare? Let's do it! I've been training Trinket, though, does that help?
Marisha: I've been reading my alchemy books.
Matt: Six beard checks.
Sam: I went to get business cards.
Matt: Right. That'll cost you 25 gold for 100.
Sam: I'm going to get two sets. One says Scanlan Shorthalt, one says Burt Reynolds.
Matt: Okay. Both have been constructed without question.
Liam: I repaid my debt to Gilmore.
Matt: All right, debt is paid, mark off that gold.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: How many is that?
Travis: I'm at five total, right? 46. 45. 55. A one. And a 95.
Matt: By the end of this week, you have grown what is a rather majestic full chin-beard. You are probably the first goliath to have facial hair. It's a full, we're talking Portland man.
Sam: Oh no.
Liam: Another thing that I did was go off and get a lathering cream, and the second to last night, after I took Grog out to the tavern, I bought him a lot of drinks.
Travis: I assume dodge.
Liam: I didn't shave off his whole beard. Only half of it.
Travis: I just became the most handsome man in the world.
Laura: Do not shave his fucking beard off.
Liam: This much.
Matt: Make a stealth check. Make a perception check. You just broke a mechanical pencil! (laughter)
Liam: DM? I rolled a natural 20. I have advantage on stealth checks, and I rolled an 18 and a 20. Natural 20.
Matt: Sleeping soundly, drunk, you do not hear the approach of Vax. As you pull out your blade and get ready, I want you to roll a sleight of hand check.
Liam: After the 20?
Matt: One thing to not be noticed. It's another to shave someone's face without being noticed. This is about stillness of fingers, not just how stealthy you can be.
Liam: I'm using Luck. Okay, so I rolled a 21.
Matt: Roll a perception check, Grog. With advantage because this is against your face.
Travis: 13.
Liam: 21.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Why are you so evil?
Liam: Why did he trip me and make me eat shit two months ago?
Taliesin: Oh!
Marisha: Oh!
Orion: Oh!
Travis: Appetizer of things to come, my friend.
Matt: The crowing sound of a distant rooster. The farmlands that surround the outside of Emon, which are relatively close, within earshot. The morning sun rises, cresting over the eastern skyline of Tal'Dorei. Grog, you come to consciousness, stretch, reach up to rub-- half a beard.
Travis: Half a beard? Like, just one side of my face?
Matt: One side of your face.
Travis: I say in a low, guttural growl--
Liam: You have no idea it was me.
Travis: Vax. I didn't have to wake up to know it was you, motherfucker.
Liam: Make an intelligence check! Make him make an intelligence check!
Marisha: We all know it was you.
Travis: I reach down, I find a dark stone on the ground, and I go over to the bare side of my face and I draw a very beautiful mustache to complete the other half of it.
Liam: He is dumb as a post. Why does he know--
Travis: Because you're the only fucking idiot stupid enough to do that!
Liam: Magic is mysterious! Why couldn't you grow half a beard due to magic?
Travis: Maybe I don't know. Let's say I assume. (laughter)
Matt: However, it is a new morning. Roll a beard check.
Travis: Eight, four.
Matt: No movement.
Liam: Sorry, big guy.
Matt: All right, so as a note, Percy, I want you to make four more tinkering rolls.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: I'm going to give him inspiration for one of them. (singing) Do you want to build a machine gun?
Taliesin: (singing) Why, yes, I really do.
Matt: What have you got?
Taliesin: 28.
Matt: 28, okay. Second one?
Marisha: Oh god.
Matt: Dice going everywhere.
Sam: Inspiration, d10.
Taliesin: I got a d6 from the last one you did.
Matt: d6 is what I gave you.
Taliesin: d10, so I'll roll a d10 with the next one. That one was 20.
Matt: All right. Third one?
Taliesin: 28.
Matt: All right, and the fourth one?
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: Okay, so over the next few days, you've constructed what amounts to a large, metallic gauntlet. You have taken this gauntlet and wired all through it insulation and metallic insulating tips in what is essentially a small, for lack of a better term, alternator of some kind.
Taliesin: I was going to try to sneak in a few bullets during that time.
Matt: The fifth roll's going to be that. You have constructed this device. The quality seems fair. It's untested technology, just something that's a brainchild of your own, utilizing Keyleth's aid. Keyleth, I'm going to have you roll a wisdom check. Roll that and add five.
Marisha: Well. Add just my base wisdom?
Matt: Plus six, it would be. Sorry.
Marisha: Yes, plus six, so 20 total.
Matt: 20 total. You step out and you set it down in the middle of the courtyard. Keyleth, you summon a storm that slowly gathers above the top of the keep. You guys start hearing sounds like rolling thunder outside and you come and look, and you see Percy and Keyleth are out standing in the middle of the courtyard. Keyleth with her arm in the air as this black, dark storm cloud begins to swirl above the entirety of Greyskull Keep. With that, she brings her hand up and then brings her fist down as a bolt of energy (thunder clap) streaks down from the clouds, slamming into a small object on the ground that then gets flung about 15 feet in a random direction. Tumbles to the ground. You rush over to grab it. You can see arcing over the metal. (electric sparking) These small electric arcs. You reach over and wait a second. You prod it. Pick it up and it's hot. Drop it instinctively. You give it a few minutes to cool off. Pick it up when it's warm enough; you put it on and there is essentially this large, sparking, metal centerpiece that is giving off this low hum.
Marisha: Did it work? Try it on Tiberius.
Orion: Sure. Here.
Taliesin: Touch.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius, make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: No! (laughter)
Orion: No! (laughter)
Matt: All right, you suffer 14 points of lightning damage and are stunned for a round. I need you to go ahead and roll a d20.
Taliesin: Cock-a-dooed. (yelps)
Marisha: High rolls startle him.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19, okay. It stays intact from the force of it. A little bit of the energy that was stored in there appears to dissipate. You figure there's only a few applications of this before it needs to be recharged, and every single time it's utilized, there's a low chance that it may detonate, or crumble, or something bad may happen.
Sam: Percy, that's amazing! What do you call it?
Orion: (unintelligible mumbling)
Taliesin: Are you all right, Tiberius?
Marisha: I go over and give him a Cure Wounds.
Matt: You manage to eventually shake off all your muscles that were so locked, tense, give way for a second.
Orion: It's effective.
Marisha: That was awesome.
Taliesin: I call it Diplomacy.
Sam: Diplomacy?
Laura: I like it.
Travis: That's great.
Laura: As we're standing watching that, Trinket comes rolling into the courtyard!
Matt: Let's go ahead and make an animal handling check.
Laura: Oh, why didn't I get more points in that?
Liam: Roll high. Come on.
Matt: I say with advantage because Trinket's been your companion for so long.
Laura: Natural 20!
Matt: Which is close to what you needed because this is a very difficult feat. Over the week you've worked with Trinket and you've worked on a technique where, instead of a multi-attack, Trinket can do what is essentially a trample attack, meaning Trinket can roll forward and roll through anything that's equal to or smaller. And damage everything in that path.
Liam: (singing) Circus bear.
Matt: We'll go over the logistics of that some other time, but Trinket has now learned a roly-poly trample attack.
Laura: Should we call it the roly-poly or the cannonball?
Travis: That's your call.
Matt: It's your call. Call it what you want.
Liam: Roly-poly is cute; cannonball is--
Laura: I think I like cannonball because it's better to shout during the battle.
Matt: The Trinket cannonball.
Liam: Roly-poly!
Orion: For brevity, I rolled six dice. I rolled, the only high ones worth mentioning was a 13, a 15, and 18.
Matt: With a 15 and an 18--
Orion: 17, I mean.
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: And the, because they're all negative three. And I attempted to teach to Lockheed to hide and speak and to stay.
Matt: Okay. To hide and to speak. To stay did not stick, unfortunately. You had two rolls that were high enough to get those two in there though. Hide and speak. All right. The morning has come to fruition. You have a few hours before you're supposed to arrive at the palace. You have been notified that this is a very formal event.
Sam: We'll need fancy robes.
Laura: Oh, we have some formal dresses already.
Matt: Roll again, please.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: You manage to construct 20 pieces of ammunition from 20 units of materials.
Travis: We have three fancy robes.
Orion: Oh, and I've picked up my glaive, right? Two days. It was time to.
Matt: You go back to Karin. You now have some kind of a knife-glaive thing.
Orion: Krull! I'm naming it Krull.
Matt: You are unsure how it will work in combat? But it looks neat.
Orion: And I attach it to my coat.
Matt: It just hangs to the side. Careful how you sit.
Liam: Do I still have the finery I wore to the Velvet Cabaret?
Matt: You would, yes.
Liam: All right. So we have to worry about you, Grog.
Travis: Are there any tapestries or curtains in the castle?
Matt: There are, actually.
Travis: I walk up to the prettiest one and I rip it down, and I throw it over myself like a toga.
Marisha: (laughing) It's pretty good.
Matt: It, in a "Foreigner in a Foreign Land" kind of way, could work.
Travis: And I practice my curtsy. Because I've seen Vex and Keyleth do it, so I think everybody does it.
Orion: I do it, as well. I don't know what's going on.
Taliesin: I want to see him roll an athletics check for that.
Laura: Tiberius.
Orion: Yes?
Laura: Could you Prestidigitate this thing and make it look like an actual thing?
Sam: Not for very long.
Matt: That's more of an illusion.
Liam: You pull the hairs out.
Travis: What's wrong with this? I'm from a strange land. My customs are my own.
Sam: Grog, have you washed yourself in water at all this week?
Travis: No. It burns. ORION I do Prestidigitation immediately to get rid of some kind of smell that I'm sure is emanating.
Travis: I freak out running around the room. (screams)
Orion: It's not water, Grog. And I keep casting it on him. It's fine, see. (splash)
Laura: You're fine.
Travis: It must have been that powder you gave me before. It made me immune.
Laura: That's what it was. You're immune. You're definitely immune to water now. Good job.
Orion: What's wrong with what you're wearing now?
Laura: His toga? He's wearing a toga made out of a tapestry.
Orion: Oh, so I'll go and I'll use some of my Dust of Illusion and I'll (pfft) on what he's wearing and shape it into a fancier robe.
Matt: From a visual standpoint, the robe tapers and curls around his form, and comes to look like a nicer robe. The material looks like it's made of almost a reddish silk. The actual imagery of the tapestry slowly fades and becomes just various textures and material. From your eyes, it's less interesting, but from a presentory standpoint it could be passable.
Liam: Don't forget his exotic facial hair, as well. That probably lends to the whole package.
Matt: Yeah, which by the way, you guys do see. It's half giant beard and half scrawled-on charcoal.
Orion: And I notice this, I go  Oh. Oh, Grog. And I use a little bit more of Dust of Illusion. I wipe it. Smear it on there.
Travis: I wipe it away!
Orion: No. Stop! Hey, hey, hey-- I put it on. Actually, I'm going to take it, and I'm going to actually put it in your hand and be like-- put it on your thumb and be like: I want you to smear this where the beard was, and I want you to think really hard that you want it there. Okay? So put it on first. There you go. That's it. And now think really hard that you want it there.
Matt: The dust tends to glisten, and where there was once charcoal outline, a mirror to your once beautiful beard continues, full, as if nothing had happened.
Travis: I reach into the bag of holding and I take out a little goblet, and I pour some ale in it. And I walk over to Vax, and I go, here you go.
Liam: This looks very good. Thank you, Grog.
Travis: You're welcome. Would you like some more?
Liam: No, I don't want to cloud my thinking before we go up against the Briarwoods.
Travis: Probably smart. I'll take that back. I crush the goblet in my hand.
Matt: This creaking metal sound. The goblet is now destroyed.
Travis: Oh no! What happened?
Matt: All right, dressed up, you all make your way to the Cloudtop district as the sun begins to bring itself to the other side of the horizon. As you approach the outside of the Tal'Dorei palace, there are general guards set up to accept guests. They're just there in wait as part of their process today. As soon as you arrive and announce yourselves as having arrived, is there anything you want to do to prepare?
Sam: Well, are you in disguise yet, Percy?
Taliesin: Yes, I look like Vax.
Sam: Cloaked Vax?
Liam: Where are we?
Matt: You guys are nearing the palace right now.
Liam: Nearing the palace? Hit me.
Marisha: I produce a few flower cummerbunds and start pinning them on the party.
Laura: I go in and put my arm through Percy's arm to make it seem like we're twins. I go in with Percy to make it look like we're the twinsies.
Sam: I'm going to cast Invisibility on Vax.
Travis: I hand the Potion of Climbing to Vax and say, don't die.
Liam: No promises.
Sam: You've got one hour until my Invisibility is going to wear off, so find a shadow.
Matt: Do you guys make yourselves known at the palace front?
Sam: Yes! We're friends here. Yes.
Matt: As you approach, you make yourselves known. The guards lead you to the front area of the palace. The sun's just starting to hit the distant side of the water of the Ozmit Sea to the west of Emon. As you guys finish talking to the front guard that you've arrived, Seeker Asum steps out of the front of the palace and sees you. "Very good. Glad you could make it. Please enter. I will wish to speak with you briefly before the event this evening."
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "Are you missing anyone?"
Laura: Oh, yes. Percy wasn't feeling very well. He ended up staying home.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Laura: 11.
Matt: "Very well. That's unfortunate. His skills could have been of use to me. Come inside."
Laura: I pat Vax's hand-- Percy's hand. What the fuck. This is creepy.
Travis: Call him Vaxy.
Laura: Vaxy.
Taliesin: That will work just fine. Thank you.
Matt: He leads you into the green meeting room you guys have had previous council meetings with. It's currently empty. He sets the guards to the side and brings you inside and says, "All right, so if my little birds speak truth, they should be arriving around dusk, so we probably have no more than 20 minutes before they are here themselves. If you're not aware, they should be referred to as Lord and Lady Briarwood. Their names: Lord Sylas Briarwood and Lady Delilah Briarwood."
Marisha: Sylas and Delilah? (singing) Hey there, Delilah.
Matt: "This is a political dinner. Please do your best not to cause a scene during the meal, as I need that time as a distraction to do my own digging."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Vax."
Taliesin: Yes?
Matt: "You're light of step and quick to fade. Would you wish to join me on this or stay with the dinner party?"
Taliesin: I'll stay with the dinner party. I wish to observe.
Sam: He also has a bit of a cold.
Taliesin: I wish to observe the Briarwoods myself.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Taliesin: (gritty voice) I wish to observe.
Liam: You've got to go more nasal, Taliesin.
Taliesin: Yes, nasal.
Orion: Yes, you need to go down here.
Sam: Sort of like sandpaper on a chalkboard.
Marisha: I should have done something about this.
Taliesin: Five.
Matt: Asum goes, "All right. If we are to do this, I would appreciate a little bit of honesty at the front point."
Orion: Well, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
Taliesin: It's all right.
Sam: This is not Vax.
Taliesin: Asum, it's me.
Matt: "I gathered as much, as soon as you began to speak. Now, I can understand, based on our previous conversation, that you have interest in keeping low key, but know that I am an ally in this. If you're not here, where is the rest of your party. Where is Vax?"
Taliesin: Vax is here.
Laura: He's stealthing.
Taliesin: He's being quiet.
Matt: "Well, Vax, if you can hear me, follow me when the meal begins. I may have use for you. All right, so. The Briarwoods have a very good relationship with Uriel and the Tal'Dorei council, established back before they expanded outside of Wildemount. I've sent two of my best gatherers into Wynandir to seek out more information on them. I don't know when that information will be available; they've only been gone but three days, and hopefully in time, we'll learn more of what their machinations may be. Many of the noble houses of Whitestone were left vacant when the de Rolos passed and were given to friends of the Briarwoods. Whispers that reach me speak of these new nobles, not being highborn, nor affiliated with the gentry at all, so I'm curious as to what allies they've made either before or after taking Whitestone for themselves."
Marisha: What are the names of these people who've taken over White--
Laura: It was the Briarwoods.
Matt: "I don't. The Briarwoods have."
Marisha: I thought they said they had friends.
Matt: "I do not know yet. I've sent folks out there. Those who have been sent to Whitestone have either defected or quit and sent me letters of resignation which is part of the reason I am very curious as to what's going on in Whitestone. Now, I've also found the documentation that delivered the ungoverned lands of Whitestone to the Briarwoods was signed, officiated and cataloged months in advance to the de Rolo family passing. I'm still following the trail but I find the timing far too convenient. With their arrival coming up, please be controlled, remember what I've told you and as more information comes in in the passing weeks I'll bring that to your attention, as well. Be observant, listen, pry what information you can, but do not raise suspicion."
Sam: We will be as quiet as a house mouse. However, if you need us to act, just utter the word "jenga."
Matt: "Jenga."
Marisha: I also make a matching corsage and pin it on his lapel, as well.
Matt: As you do, he looks down at it and goes, "Thank you; it's not my color."
Marisha: You know, that's fine.
Matt: "I appreciate the offer but my theme goes with browns and blacks so as not to be seen. This is a bit bright for my taste."
Marisha: It might have had a more utilitarian purpose, but it's fine.
Matt: "I'm not going to be at the dinner, but thank you."
Laura: Do you have any of your people learning about the Briarwoods? Are they magic users in any way? Have you heard anything?
Matt: "The only thing I can recall as the information of the Briarwoods, at least what's come this way was while they were ruling the lands in Wildemount as part of their kingdom there, Lady Delilah Briarwood was an accomplished practitioner of the arcane arts, a long-trained wizard as far as I know and been through quite a few different schools and had a brief stint here in Emon training at the Lyceum, but that was naught but nine, ten years back? Maybe more."
Laura: Do any of you know, as somebody practiced in the arcane arts, are you good at seeing through illusions? Or--
Sam: Who, me? Who, us?
Laura: Anybody that is, you know, very skilled?
Orion: (chuckles) Of course. I just need to know that one's happening. So it's tricky, is what I'm saying.
Laura: So she wouldn't automatically know. They wouldn't be able to spot immediately that Percy is not actually--
Orion: Somebody would have to have rather powerful abilities to see through an illusion spell like a disguise or such. It's like a rakshasa could see though that kind of thing, per experience. I doubt that the Briarwoods have any--
Matt: At which point you hear, muffled in the distance a (horn noise) this horn sound that seems to be blown as a notification that the arrival of guests has rolled in.
Travis: Are you ready for this, Vaxy?
Taliesin: No. Let's do this.
Orion: Would you like me to cast Fireball?
Matt: Asum goes, "No, please, none of that. Vax, if you can hear me in this room, ten minutes into the meal see if you can spot me and follow me in the foyer. Good luck."
Laura: Great.
Sam: Keyleth, I hope you phoned ahead and gave them your order for a vegan meal.
Marisha: Oh, I always do.
Taliesin: She's vegan. Of course she told them.
Marisha: Exactly. It's on the RSVP.
Matt: Asum leaves the room. Do you wish to stay inside, do you wish to see the guests as they arrive?
Taliesin: Let's go be social.
Sam: Let's go mingle.
Matt: All right. You guys head back out to the front of the palace, the large stairway that leads down into the central road outside of the palace in the middle of the Cloudtop district. The sky itself has now come to a dark purple blue slowly moving over into the distant sunset. The sun has disappeared beneath the sea and you've completed the dusk as the sunset slowly turns gold. A dark wood carriage flanked by four armored men on horseback pulls onto the road right before the Tal'Dorei palace. A young man steps from the front of the carriage and opens the door. Stepping out you see a strong, tall man in the nearby lantern light. Short brown hair frames a very chiseled and handsome face adorned with a well groomed goatee. His clothing is based in blue and black, fitted elegance trimmed with golds and red. A strip of grey fur cresting over one shoulder framing his torso. He turns, extends his hand towards the door, where a feminine gloved hand finds it. A beautiful woman steps out after. Her hair dark auburn and pulled up into a tight braided bun, resembling some sort of a glamorous school teacher almost. Her gown is in the same color scheme as the man, if a bit heavier blue than black, and a long billowing skirt tapers up to be form-fitted across her body, continuing upward to wrap her neck nearly to the jaw. They both turn to face the greeting party, bowing slightly as two of their companion guards flank their approach up the steps. The other two helping the young man who steered the carriage carry their rather large bags behind them. This is Lord Sylas Briarwood and Lady Delilah Briarwood. As you guys are standing here at this point, stepping behind you a hand reaches over and touches the back of your shoulder. You look behind you and there, smiling, is Arcanist Allura Vysoren dressed in a very fine blue gown. You've never seen her quite so formal, but very beautiful type thing. She glances over the shoulders, "It's so good to see you. I'm so glad you all could make it."
Laura: So wonderful to see you. I give her a hug.
Matt: She gives a little hug, too. Glances over at you. "A pleasure, Vax'ildan."
Orion: See? She can see it.
Marisha: Yes, she can.
Matt: What are you doing?
Orion: You look gorgeous Allura, and my friends are just making weird faces right now. It's probably because of how beautiful you look.
Matt: As you guys are having this discussion about 15 feet from you the Briarwoods enter the palace, their guards enter with them. There's been no pleasantry and very much an intended arrival. None of you are recognizable to them, thus they make no intent of introducing themselves.
Laura: We catch any of their eye at all?
Matt: They appear to be looking about and taking in their surroundings but they're both engaged in a mumbled conversation between the two of them as they enter.
Marisha: Is anyone waiting to greet them?
Matt: As you follow where they're going, as you walk into the main foyer area where you stand there, waiting carefully at the back, there are a number of servants that have arrived and have taken some of their bags and help them up the stairs. There is one, the head servant who is there talking to them and you hear him speaking to them. "Wait in your quarters be ready, the meal should be ready within the hour. If you would be so kind as to prepare yourselves, relax, unwind, set up your rooms. You're to stay for a few days at the very least. But we shall call you when the meal is ready." At which Lord Sylas Briarwood turns to him and says, "I greatly appreciate the information. Just come to our room and let us know when the food is ready. Now, come, my dear"
Laura: Can I keep an eye on them as they're walking to their room? Just as long as I can see their mouths moving, I can read their lips.
Taliesin: I also want to scan their entourage to see if I recognize any faces.
Matt: Okay, perception check. Perception check for you, as well.
Laura: Do I have to perceive it? I have a feat that I can read it.
Matt: Oh, you do?
Laura: Yeah, I have Observant  Read Lips meaning I can read lips from any language I can understand.
Matt: That's true. Okay, good to know.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19. No, they all appear to be run of the mill soldiers, nothing, no one that catches your attention. The young man who is helping them as they go through seems familiar, but no one that is jumping out at you right now. Someone you may have crossed paths with in the past but nobody that's really been formally involved in your life previously. Maybe a denizen of Whitestone that you've crossed before when he was younger. As they walk up the steps, you keep an eye best you can as they go. You catch a little bit of conversation that seems to speak about how long the journey's been, "That's all right, we'll be in there soon to discuss and we'll be out as soon as we can. We won't stay any longer than we need to." And that's the extent you gather as they continue up the stairway. As the next hour or so passes?
Orion: I flirt with Allura.
Matt: Okay, do you want to talk with Allura?
Orion: I flirt with her throughout the hour.
Matt: Okay, she's grateful for the conversation. She laughs, and she's very attentive to all of you and excited to see you. She lets you know that she's been caught in a little bit of the bureaucracy in the city and despises that. She's taken some time off for herself for about a week or so.
Orion: Actually, towards the end of that conversation I would like to bring up a specific thing. We've been having such a wonderful conversation.
Matt: "Of course, no, of course, Tiberius"
Orion: I think when things settle down a bit, perhaps you and I and maybe Grog, and Lady Kima can perhaps go out. Break bread and have some wine and such on an evening with each other. I believe my friend rather fancies Kima. What say you?
Matt: "Well, that's very flattering, Tiberius. I appreciate the invitation. I would say that particular mix of company might prove a bit awkward."
Orion: Well, of course. If it was awkward, nobody wants that.
Matt: "Perhaps we might-- I mean if you would like to get some tea sometime I'd be more than happy to--"
Orion: Oh, just you and I?
Matt: "Yes. Kima's quite a ways off and I believe she's still in Vasselheim, last I spoke with her, and yes, tea would be lovely."
Orion: Okay, all right, wonderful.
Sam: You walk away.
Orion: I walk away. (laughter)
Marisha: He got a date!
Travis: Is that carriage. Is the carriage still there?
Matt: The carriage, as far as you see, is being led off slowly by the servants to a side area of the palace.
Travis: And the armed on horseback that were with the Briarwoods when they came in?
Matt: Two of them are with the Briarwoods, and there are two helping to bring their stuff up to their rooms.
Travis: The four are with them?
Matt: The four are with them, yes.
Sam: I jump up and give him a little high five. Then, as an hour has passed, I beckon to Vax and find a shadowy area.
Travis: Real Vax or Vaxy?
Sam: Real Vax. Because my thing is wearing off, buddy.
Marisha: I've been scanning the crowd. Have I noticed anything over the past hour of any of our people? Any locals, any council members, who may be acting a little shifty?
Matt: Looking about, the council is roughly stepping in and out of the area like they're getting ready for the dinner and arriving from the Cloudtop district.
Marisha: Any of them breaking a sweat? Acting weird?
Laura: Yeah. I want to check out this, too.
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight roll, both of you guys.
Marisha: 22.
Laura: 23.
Matt: The two of you scanning over. Looking over there is Lord Riskel Daxio, he's an elven male, who was the one who is master of trade of the city. He's the one that handled the ordering of your keep when you first had it brought to your attention by Uriel. Allura, of course. Tofor Brotorus is there, the female dragonborn paladin. She seems generally just not happy about the whole scenario and she's not armored, she's dressed in what would be considered formal attire but it's not a dress, it's not a suit, it's this asexual formal outfit that looks like a robe but also like a suit and she does not look to be happy in it at all. Just arms crossed, at the far end, back against the wall just (growling noises) slowly stewing, not wanting to be there. You also see Arbiter Brom Goldhand, who is the master of law. Was previously one of the heads of the guard there within Emon and then was then given the job of being the head of the Watchful Hall. He's the master of law essentially in the city. That's right, Tofor is the master of defense that took over for Krieg after Krieg was slain. So those are the council members. Most everyone else there you see are servants. As time goes on eventually there is the ringing of a dinner bell down the hallway and everyone turns their head and notices and steps over to the great hall of the palace where the feast is to be given to you and other guests.
Sam: As we move, I release and then recast Invisibility on him when I see that there's a moment where everyone's distracted.
Matt: All righty, so you rejuvenate the Invisibility spell.
Marisha: Oh look, Tiberius, they have bananas!
Orion: Oh!
Laura: I can sense you, you dick.
Matt: You're escorted to the hall by Allura. She keeps chatting with you guys and asking questions about how Vasselheim was, and is Kima well? She stayed back there. She asks questions about why Pike isn't here and you tell her the story that she stayed behind and everything. You make your way into the great hall which seats a vast number of people. There are five major tables meant for like large feasts but there is one central square table in the far end that is by this giant hearth. This fireplace is probably a good six feet high and about 12 feet wide. It's a grandiose visual on the far end of this hall, and there's a long table right there set for about 20 people. You don't know if there will be that many there at the table but it can seat that many. At which point, all the different members of the council have their seats around it. You guys find your seats.
Laura: Can we get a feel for where the Briarwoods are going to sit?
Matt: With this many seats set, it's hard to tell, but you gather that they're probably going to sit--
Laura: Are there place cards? (laughs)
Matt: There are no place cards but there are two ends of the table that have two chairs at each end.
Laura: Okay. Can I position myself when I sit to where I can see them? So I can read their mouths, specifically.
Matt: Certainly. You can probably sit on the center or the far end of the table looking in their direction, should be fine.
Orion: Can I sit at the far end of the table at the very opposite end, if not at head of the end--
Laura: That's probably where Uriel is going to sit.
Orion: Oh. Who?
Travis: The king.
Orion: Oh! Not that chair.
Matt: Okay, but adjacent to it?
Orion: Yes. That would be rude, I think.
Matt: Okay, fair enough.
Sam: I assume I sit at the kiddie table because I'm so tiny?
Laura: They've got a booster chair for you, Scanlan.
Matt: They do have adjustments for gnomish guests-- is a way of putting it. All right, after you guys sit for a few moments, another servant steps forward and says, "Please, if we might rise for our guests Lord and Lady Briarwood to join us at the table--"
Sam: I am risen already. I'm standing already.
Matt: Lord and Lady Briarwood now enter arm in arm, slowly walking from the far end of the great hall. They make their way to one end of the table. They both wordlessly sit down, smiling and acknowledge everyone at the table. There's a moment of silence and then another servant says "And would all please attention be given to our sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the second and the Empress Salda Tal'Dorei." At which point, the sovereign and his wife enter from the same entrance point. Everyone stands up from their chair, waits for them to get to the edge of the table, at which point they nod their head. Everyone gives a low bow. You guys follow suit, following the social graces you're not familiar with but trying to learn as you go. Except for Tiberius, you know this deal. You all follow his lead on this. Eventually, everyone sits down again. Tables are pushed in by servants behind you, you're like 'oh' caught off guard by the whole experience. Uriel looks about the table with a smile, shoulder length brown hair and his chin goatee very well crafted into almost a point now. He looks about the table. "Thank you, Lord and Lady Briarwood, for making the journey across the lands so that we might meet in person, finally. Please, allow me to introduce our dining party and esteemed council of Tal'Dorei." He goes around the table introducing, "Arbiter Brom Goldhand. He is the master of law of our city, and is responsible for maintaining all of these grand people of our fair town in the realm of safety and order. We have Lord Riskel Daxio. He is our head of planning and construction; has overseen many of the expansions of the city, and is a trusted friend of mine. We have the Arcanist Allura Vysoren: one of my trusted advisors, one of the greatest arcane minds of all of Tal'Dorei, and the overseer of all things arcane within our city. We have the Guardian Tofor Brotorus, a fierce warrior and currently the master of defense in our city and hopefully for a long time to come." Tofor gives a (scoffs) sound and everyone is put off by it, but they're also seemingly used to it. "Arbiter Brom Goldhand: master of law. My lovely wife, the Empress Salda. We have here within our midst, as well: Vox Machina, a team of intrepid adventurers who rose up and saved my family's life and very well the city of Emon and have since proven very useful to our territory. Grog Strongjaw, a goliath of interesting dress, but strong of heart and blade. We have Vex'halia, half-elven maiden with a bow as swift as the fastest eagle." Looking next, he says, "We have here Vax'ildan, blades quick and eyes sharp, not a whisper passes his ear. Ah! There you are! Scanlan Shorthalt, a performer known far and wide. A wit as clever as you've ever seen. His songs are whispered through taverns across the land. We have Tiberius Stormwind--"
Orion: I'm from Draconia.
Matt: "Hailing from Draconia, which," he looks across to the Briarwoods, "the kingdom you hail from originally not being far off from Draconia, perhaps you've had some dealings with the Stormwinds?" And the Briarwoods give a nod. "Yes, we have seen them in the past. We've heard many good things."
Orion: We're pretty cool.
Matt: "We have over here, Keyleth of the Ashari, if I am correct on that? She is a denizen of the natural lands and protector of all things nature within Tal'Dorei."
Marisha: Hi.
Matt: "There was one more."
Taliesin: Two, and they could not be in attendance.
Laura: Yes, ill.
Orion: They were running around. They got diarrhea. Isn't that what you said?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "Anyway. Welcome, and thank you." He reaches over and takes a small glass and clinks it with his silverware, the servants immediately muster up and start pulling glasses out and pouring wine into everyone's glasses and the conversation begins to naturally bustle about for this meal. Immediately conversation builds in about Uriel talking across to the Briarwoods talking about the bridge. He says "Now, the Uriel bridge, I don't think the name was necessary, but it's appreciated from my perspective. Now in this union between Wildemount and Tal'Dorei-- do we have a confirmed trade route between the two?" At which Lord Briarwood returns, "This is indeed very true. We are hoping that through this passageway, we'd have means of rather quick trade between this kingdom and yours. Not to mention this would allow for individuals to travel for carried parcels very quickly and we're hoping to establish perhaps a very quick means of communication outside of the arcane for those who cannot afford these various luxuries." Lady Briarwood taps on his shoulder and says, "Yes, and by the way, I don't mean to bring up a sore subject but it's come to our attention that apparently last Winter's Crest, there was an attempt on your life," and the table gets a little quiet for a second. "We're sorry to hear that and wish to express our--" Uriel puts his hand out and says, "No, no, it's quite all right. It was but a paltry attempt, and it was thwarted actually by Vox Machina. They have been tremendous in keeping us safe and I greatly appreciate their aid in overseeing my family's good fortune." Yes?
Liam: While all this is going on, can you describe. Are the Briarwood couple together, seated next to each other?
Matt: They are seated right next to each other at the head of one table across the way.
Liam: I intend to be behind them, but what's behind them, like?
Matt: What's behind them is just open space and servants. There's probably a good 25 servants here that are just like sitting there patiently, lying in wait for--
Liam: And behind the servants is a wall so there's lots of open busy crowded space? Okay.
Matt: And tables. There's like other unused tables in this great hall that are just out there. Four other ones.
Liam: All right. I'm going to drink the potion of climbing that Grog gave me, and I'm spidering up the wall and I'd love, while listening to all this to make an insight check on them just as they talk, just for funsies.
Matt: To inquire about--?
Liam: Just to see if they seem like sacks of shit.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Liam: Luck, oh not that lucky. This is going to be very low. Yeah, never mind, low. Very low.
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance really at all. They're very charming. You were expecting this very dour, dark, evil couple from all the conversation, but they seem nice. They seem earnest. They keep to themselves definitely, they're definitely a very tight couple but nothing about them catches you off guard as being anything instinctively twisted.
Liam: It's very hard to read them upside-down.
Laura: Could I inquire to Lady Briarwood?
Matt: You're saying this out loud? The conversation comes to a halt, she-- "Yes, of course. I'm so sorry, what was your name again?"
Laura: Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "Vex'ahlia. Absolute pleasure to meet you. Delilah."
Laura: You as well. I notice your dress is quite lovely. It doesn't look like a fashion that I'm used to seeing. Where do you hail from originally?
Matt: "We hail from Wildemount. It's quite a ways from here. The continent to the far east."
Laura: Really, I'm not familiar.
Matt: "You should come by sometime. We haven't been home in a number of years, having to tend to Whitestone, but we have quite an elaborate homestead there. We'd love to have you come stay with us if you ever find yourself in that side of the world."
Laura: I would love to visit. How long have you been at Whitestone?
Matt: "We've been at Whitestone for the better part of-- I can't even remember." And Lord Briarwood looks, he goes, "Best I can recall, four or five years. It was an unfortunate mantle to pick up but we've done what we can in honor of the passed de Rolo family."
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Orion: I was just going to ask, you seem such a lovely couple. Do you have any children?
Matt: "We unfortunately do not. It seems it was not in the cards for us to bear. However, we consider many of our esteemed servants and house guests our extended family. So we can leave a legacy, however we can possibly do so."
Laura: Can we insight check as, what they're saying?
Matt: Certainly.
Laura: I mean, I know they're lying out their asses. Fuck. 18.
Matt: 18? Seems pretty earnest.
Sam: Lord Briarwood. Down here, hi.
Matt: "I'm sorry, I--" he snaps and a servant moves a large like pig platter out of the way that was blocking your head from his vision.
Travis: You can move that over here actually, thank you. (chomping noises)
Sam: Lord Briarwood, we may share a mutual friend or acquaintance of some sort. My father was a prominent doctor, and he may have studied medicine with a fellow that you know named Dr. Ripulah, Ripley? Dr. Ripley? Do you know such a person?
Matt: "Yes, actually. Dr. Ripley is one of our esteemed physicians in Whitestone. Yes, recently come into some land herself, although she has been on holiday for some time. Following her own research as doctors are wont to do."
Sam: Are you close with her?
Matt: "I wouldn't say close, but she's been a friend at times, and she was one of the few that came with us from Wildemount over to Whitestone and has helped us restructure and maintain and help facilitate the blossoming of a city without a leader."
Sam: She sounds wonderful. Well, when you see her next tell her that my father, Dr. Jeff Shorthalt, said hi.
Matt: "Jeff Shorthalt, I will be happy to pass that along."
Taliesin: Lord Briarwood, I am not familiar with Whitestone. How did you become caretaker of such a place?
Matt: At which point, one of the other council members goes, "Um." and puts his hand out. "It's all right," and he pats the hand of his wife. He looks over at you with a smile. "We know not if it is connected with the disease, but before all this occurred, we became very close friends with the de Rolo family about ten or so years ago. Actually, the first time we met is an interesting tale, if you want to tell it, please." His wife goes, "All right all right, so they were taking a brief vacation east to Wildemount. Apparently, they had not traveled and they brought their family with them, a whole gaggle of small children. They were coming this direction. Now our homestead is on the western outskirts of Wildemount so one of the first places you traverse before going into the kingdom proper. However, the family, the de Rolo family had been caught in a bad downpour, a storm that had blown in and made travel rather impossible, and apparently they stopped not far from our homestead. They came to our front door asking for shelter for the evening, and we were happy to house them. We gave them dry clothes, food for the night, and well, a rather fast friendship was forged. As we quickly began to notice they weren't just rabble of the street, they themselves were highborn as we were and in a very dire circumstance. So we let them in, they stayed for but a week. We showed them about the western side of Wildemount and let them on their way. And since then we've had many different years we've spent together as families going on various journeys and trips together. But as time went on we got busy on our own and separate ways and we hadn't spoken in a while. They were in the process of discussing the building of the Uriel bridge about five years ago, and we were going to meet with them about pursuing this venture as a joint-- well, when the disease took them. The family passed on. We were surprised that they would've considered leaving Whitestone in our name, and we couldn't say no, at this point. To carry on their legacy, I felt, was important enough let alone the memory of that to carry on the building of this Uriel bridge. I thought I really wanted to spearhead the wishes of Frederick."
Orion: That is so courageous of you. Do you want me to Fireball her now?
Taliesin: A toast, then!
Matt: "A toast."
Taliesin: To gracious hosts.
Matt: "To gracious hosts."
Sam: L'Chaim.
Orion: Gesundheit.
Matt: "So. Uriel," and he looks across the way and says, "one of our largest exports in Whitestone is timber from the forests and woods that surround Whitestone and the Alabaster Sierras. We've had a rising danger in the surrounding woods. It has made it proven difficult to export most of these wooded goods. If it is possible, we would like for you to send some aid, perhaps a small band of soldiers to lead a strike into the woods." Uriel looks across the way and says, "Ah yes, we can definitely discuss that, I don't see why not. We are currently in peacetime and we have a reserve of soldiers we can send your way."
Marisha: I mean, we're also free.
Sam: Oh yes.
Matt: As the meal continues on, more conversations arise. A lot of bureaucratic BS. Anyone want to interject anything or ask any questions?
Orion: Is Allura there, still?
Matt: Allura is there, yes.
Orion: As we're eating I'm going to  By the way, did you ever perhaps finish making that extra earring I gave you several weeks ago? I don't know how long it's been.
Matt: Allura looks, glances over to the side and says, "Yes, it's been completed. No one's come by to take it from me"
Orion: I had no idea, I'll send someone.
Matt: "And as a note, I'm about a month away from completing the sigil in the base mentof your keep."
Orion: Oh, wonderful. Thank you, that's-- so talented. What flavor tea do you like, Allura?
Matt: "I prefer a mint or jasmine, to be honest."
Orion: Noted. I walk away
Matt: You step up and walk away from the dinner table. (chair scraping) Tiberius stands up in the middle of the discussion and walks away from the feast
Taliesin: Lady Briarwood, it is such an act of compassion to take on such responsibility as a house such as Whitestone.
Sam: Tiberius, get back here.
Orion: You said walk away.
Sam: No! Not every time!
Matt: "Well, thank you. This is the first time we've been away from Whitestone in many years."
Taliesin: That's such a spectacular act of kindness and generosity. Would, perhaps, Vox Machina also be of service to you?
Matt: "Perhaps, you seem strong of build and--"
Laura: We are handier than we look.
Marisha: We killed a beholder once.
Travis: Just right out with it.
Matt: "That is an impressive feat, young Keyleth."
Marisha: We should just lead with that.
Taliesin: And we killed an illithid once, as well.
Matt: "Slain a beholder? Uriel, you keep in the presence of some mighty heroes." Uriel goes, (chuckles) "They are proven allies. I mean, if you utilize their assistance. That would be very possible. May have something coming up that I could use them for myself, but we'll discuss in time. Nevertheless, the meal continues." She smiles and looks back at you.
Marisha: Can I do an insight check to see if that look at Percy-not-Percy was--
Matt: You can make an insight check, sure.
Taliesin: Can you? Can you make an insight check? I don't think you can.
Marisha: She looked interesting.
Matt: You're distracted by the pattern, the brocade across her torso area.
Taliesin: You know, you could roll lower if you tried.
Orion: I want to do an arcana check on them.
Matt: What are you checking for?
Orion: If they're armed with anything that has arcane properties.
Matt: Make an arcana check. It's not so much something you can sense, more than you can look for symbols. You rolled a 17? It looks like there are elements of their accoutrements that are, like any of you are carrying on yourselves. There's a choker that's part of the outfit that Lady Briarwood wears that itself does appear to have some tiny enchantment-based markings across it. They are adorned in various protective magic, but so is everybody else at the table.
Orion: Got you. Standard gear.
Travis: Lord and Lady Briarwood, we are, in fact, quite handy. Vax, we also killed an illithid, if I recall.
Taliesin: I think we did. Did we befriend an illithid or kill it? I think we did both.
Orion: We befriended it, it betrayed us, and then we killed it.
Sam: But enough about us. Earlier, you were telling us about a poor family that came down with that disease. I'm just curious, coming from a medical family. What was the disease that they had?
Matt: They look at each other and give a sorrowful look. "We do not know. We were only given the information that the family had passed, but a month or two after it had already occurred."
Marisha: The entire family. All of them?
Matt: "Most of the castle seemed to have fallen to it, as well."
Laura: So dreadful.
Matt: Uriel says, "My condolences, by the way. I understand that's very hard." "It's all right. The least we could do is try to carry on their legacy."
Laura: I know how hard it is to lose someone very close to you. I'm sorry for your loss.
Matt: "It's appreciated." He looks at his wife, and she looks up for a second. "It's all right."
Marisha: I'm sorry. I'm just a little confused. If the whole family died of disease, weren't you afraid to go into this town, into this castle? Weren't you afraid of contracting this disease yourself?
Matt: "There was worry of such a thing, but before Whitestone castle could be entered, we made sure to send in our best clerics to rid of any existing possible lingering disease, and to make sure to remove any corpses or bodies that may contain it. There was a period of time that we were worried, but after a few months, we came to the conclusion that we were safe, and thus we moved our way in."
Travis: Lucky for you.
Sam: Anyone care for some games of jenga?
Matt: At this point, the dessert has been brought out. It's a fine, almost creme brulee-type dish. It's delicious.
Laura: Are they whispering to themselves, still?
Matt: As part of the discussions, there are a few side exchanges here and there. The best you can make from it is, "Did you notice him?" She says, "Yes, don't worry." And, "Tonight, we'll stay." And those are the only things you can make out from the exchanges back and forth.
Laura: How long do you plan on staying here, Lord and Lady?
Matt: "Well, after this dinner, I imagine a few days, and we'll be on our way. We're merely here to finalize the paperwork for the bridge construction." She looks over and gives a nod to Lord Daxio, who gives her a nod back. "And maybe see the city for a while, and make our way back. It's too hard to be away, and our nephew has been left in charge of this."
Laura: Do you have plans on the morrow? I would love to give you a tour of the city.
Matt: "That would be lovely."
Laura: Wonderful! Should I send word? How should we arrange this?
Matt: "Where are you staying?"
Laura: We are outside of town at our own keep, actually.
Matt: "What's it called?"
Laura: The Greyskull Keep.
Matt: "Greyskull Keep. We will have you sent for when the time is right."
Laura: Lovely. That will be so fun.
Orion: Vex is so into showing people our city.
Laura: Perhaps you can show me some more of your fashions. I love your dress so much.
Matt: "Oh, well it's hard to show you this here. What you need to see is the Wildemount fashion district. It is divine."
Laura: Sounds wonderful.
Travis: I look at Vax and I go, does anyone want any dessert?
Orion: (gulping) I'm having a little.
Laura: Vax? You looked at Vax?
Travis: Yeah. Vaxy. The one that I can look at.
Orion: Do you want dessert now? Would you like this fireball creme brulee?
Taliesin: I'm just fine.
Marisha: (whispered) I don't know what to do now.
Matt: The meal has been now wound down, the dishes are being gathered by the servants, the wine has stopped being poured, and now everyone settles in with sighs of a meal well spent. The other council members begin to excuse themselves. Uriel stands up and says, "My apologies, me and my wife find that rest is in our future. Please, feel free to walk the halls as you see fit. Thank you again, Lord and Lady Briarwood, for joining us, and we're excited to continue this venture. Good night to you all."
Marisha: Hey, you should Hunter's Mark them or something.
Sam: Wait, no, that's Uriel that's leaving.
Liam: What's the gentleman who realized that I was there? Earlier, before we came in?
Matt: Asum? He's not in the room. He's been waiting in the foyer for you.
Laura: He was telling you to meet him in the foyer, a long time ago.
Liam: Oh, that's all right.
Laura: (whispered) You should go spy on their room. Go check out that room. I'll distract them.
Travis: (muffled) Go see if he's still there.
Matt: Lord and Lady Briarwood also stand up. "On that note as well, I think our meal has come to an end. We appreciate your--" and Lady Briarwood continues the sentence, "and we wish you all a fine night--"
Liam: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste and scuttling along the ceiling back towards the door.
Orion: I know a particular spell that it's rather wonderful. And I go blow a stream out and do a cantrip, Control Magic, and start doing a nice dragon fire dance that I know of from my home.
Sam: I play a little flute.
Matt: They both sit and watch for a moment--
Sam: (Star Wars Cantina song)
Liam: Am I finding what's-his-face?
Matt: You make your way out, and he's not there. You don't see him anywhere.
Liam: I'm doubling back.
Matt: Okay, you double back. After about a minute of this, "Yes, well, thank you kindly for that wondrous display. I feel that sleep takes us, and we are going to retire to our quarters. Have a wonderful night, everyone."
Marisha: Are you staying within the castle?
Matt: "Yes, yes."
Marisha: Oh! Fantastic.
Orion: Have a wonderful rest.
Matt: "And good night." And they both stand up, and then they make their way out, through the main great hall exit.
Liam: I'm following.
Matt: Okay. You gather across the ceiling as you go. You watch them head up the stairway to the second floor. They head to the right, down a long hallway, a series of doors. They come up to a door, where there are two guards standing outside. The same guards that led them inside the building, and were riding on horseback.
Laura: Could I Hunter's Mark him before they go in their bedroom?
Matt: Hunter's Mark is technically a minor spell. You could try it.
Laura: I mean they're walking away, when their back is turned, could I do it when they're not paying attention?
Matt: I'd say, make a stealth check. Trying to do this subtly at the table.
Laura: 20! (cheers)
Matt: You Hunter's Mark which one?
Laura: Lord-- no--
Sam: Sylas or Delilah?
Laura: Delilah.
Matt: Okay, you mark Delilah as she walks off. You have a sense of where she is at all times in the vicinity. As you follow them, they go to the door, the guards open the door for them, and lead them into their room, and then close the door.
Liam: Oh, that fast? All right. How close to the door are the guards? Right up against it?
Matt: Not against it, but immediately to the right and left of it.
Laura: I don't know what else to do, you guys.
Sam: Burn their room down. We've got to find Seeker Assam, or whatever his name is.
Liam: I yank off my serpent belt and throw it as far as I can. Not as far as I can. 20 feet, and set it in motion, so there's now a snake in the hall, 20 feet in front of these guys.
Matt: All right. You take it, and you throw the snake. Let me check one thing on Invisibility real fast. Just because--
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah, just, snake flies down the hall--
Orion: If he does an action, it dissipates the spell. It's not Greater Invisibility, so he goes uninvisible, when he does something.
Matt: "Attacks or casts a spell." It's not either of those. It's activating an item. You take the belt (whoosh), fling it (hissing), the snake appears to the side. One of the guards looks over. Looks over at the other guard, he pulls out his weapon and one of the guards steps over to where the serpent is and starts trying to stomp it out, and it nips up and gets some of the armor, and he's just, stomping out the snake.
Liam: So one's 20 feet away now?
Matt: About 25 feet away, yeah.
Liam: 25 feet away, and one guy stayed?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Kill them.
Liam: I drop, and I'm going to bean him on the head, like his name is Kynan.
Matt: Okay! All right. As you leap off the top, you (whoosh) land on the ground. Go ahead and roll an attack.
Liam: Okay. "Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet."
Matt: And he is surprised, because he does not know you're there.
Liam: And I'm invisible, so that's an 18. That is 29 to hit. Using the blunt end! I just want to knock him out.
Matt: Right, okay. Go ahead and roll sneak attack damage.
Liam: Doubled. 12, 17, 23, 24, 26, so 52. Plus-- No, I mean, if I am as skilled a rogue as I am, how could I not just want to knock somebody out, and not unintentionally-- ten. On top of the 52.
Matt: 62 damage will do it. You (whack) right to the side of the helmet, with a dull (thud) sound. Just falls like a sack of potatoes right against the wall.
Liam: Hand on the door. Is it locked?
Matt: The door is currently not locked. You can see the guard you just knocked out, had the key in his hand and was in the process of going to lock the door right when that happened.
Liam: Okay, so I flip my hood over my head, and I quietly go in the door.
Sam: Oh wait, you're not invisible anymore.
Liam: Yeah, I know.
Matt: Okay. So. (creak) You open the door and enter the room, closing it behind you. As soon as you enter the room, it's a large guest room. There are two windows across the way with curtains drawn to the side. You can see the darkness of the night sky behind that, and the rest of the low-lit Cloudtop District visible, and the courtyard surrounding the palace. Immediately to the right and left of you, you see two large tables that are covered in black cloths, that are just, tables to be, you know, vases and stuff set up on them. One's clean, one has actual decor on it. There are two wooden tables immediately to the right and left of you. There's a large red rug, central to the floor, that is circular, and on the far corners next to the two windows you see armoires, like dressers, for clothing and such. In the center of the room, you see, on top of the rug, against the wall between the two windows is a large canopy bed, very beautifully carved from dark wood, has a purple cloth silk canopy that drifts down around it. And on the far end, you can see now, against one of the tables, is Lady Briarwood is currently taking jewelry off of one of her arms while Lord Briarwood is right by the bed, holding on to the post, like he's just walked over to that area.
Liam: They're both at the bed?
Matt: They're both at the bed.
Liam: I got a 25 for stealth and it didn't work?
Matt: They're both looking in your direction.
Liam: All right. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I heard a noise in here. I work for the city. I apologize. That was really stupid. As you were. I walk out.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: I'll use my last Luck of the day. Didn't do it; same thing. Nine, 11.
Matt: 11?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Lord Briarwood goes, "Oh, well, that's all right. Not to worry, in no serious rush. Isn't that right, my dear?" And she looks over, she stops taking her jewelry off and turns. "Yes, yes, of course. As you, a man who works for the city."
Liam: Yes ma'am.
Matt: "What do you do for the city, if I may ask?"
Liam: Oh, I'm a guard. I mean, there's not really a name for what I do. I work for Uriel, I just-- I'm security, ma'am, and I thought I heard a noise in here. And I heard a body fall, I thought-- sounded like a body fell.
Matt: They both step a little bit closer. Looking at you--
Liam: I'm backing up as I'm talking, I'm right at the door! I didn't shut it behind me, I just cracked it open.
Matt: Right. Lady Briarwood goes, "You look strangely similar to a gentleman we just had dinner with."
Liam: That's crazy!
Matt: "It's uncanny how similar you look."
Liam: Yep.
Matt: (arcane chanting)
Liam: And I run!
Matt: You get to make a wisdom save, is what you do.
Sam: Jenga!
Liam: Not good. It's an eight.
Matt: You turn to move and your muscles (crunching) tense up, as you're unable to physically move.
Liam: This is awkward, ma'am, I'm just trying to do my job.
Matt: You're halfway through the doorway, stuck in place, as she keeps walking forward now, giving you a curious look. Lord Briarwood comes and flanks you from the other side. (clicks tongue) "You try and flee. I'm merely asking you questions. Come, let us discuss in more private quarters." And you feel the hand of Lord Briarwood slam onto your other shoulder. "Don't worry. You look delicious." And he pulls you into the room as she closes the door behind, and that's where we're going to end tonight's session. (screaming)
Sam: Jenga! We had a safe word for a reason!
Liam: That's cool.
Travis: Hashtag Save Vax!
Marisha: Dude, I think they're into some weird shit.
Matt: That was a very slow tension building episode that turned very interesting at the end. How you doing, Taliesin?!
Taliesin: (yells and groans)
Laura: They're so evil!
Marisha: They're creeping me out, man.
Taliesin: You're making it so much worse than I ever imagined.
Laura: They're totally vampires.
Marisha: Now we're going to have to rescue Vax.
Taliesin: I swear if the Briarwoods are responsible for a party kill, I'm going to feel like such an asshole.
Matt: (laughs) That'd be rough. Well, cool. We'll all be picking up that next week on Thursday.
Marisha: Oh, please, like you haven't rushed into a situation before, Orion?
Orion: No! I never have. I can actually say that.
Liam: Like attacking an inanimate door?
Marisha: Yeah! Or, or launching a Fireball in the middle of a wood house?
Taliesin: Trying to convince an entire army of illithid to follow you?
Marisha: Yeah! Rushing off to Draconia to buy a Bag of Holding.
Sam: Or just today, running off to the, to the sigil!
Orion: Never put myself in danger except for the illithid. Never put myself in danger. The fire thing. Now granted, I didn't know how Fireball worked at the time.
Liam: I'm sorry you're such a nervous fellow!
Orion: I'm just saying!
Laura: Oh hey, what's going on?
Liam: Come on, how am I going to play my second character unless I die now?
Taliesin: Or you could become a vampire! You can be a vampire half-elf.
Matt: All right guys, so! We got a lot of awesome donations tonight. Let's go ahead and rock through those.
Liam: I regret nothing.
Matt: As you shouldn't! That got really interesting really fast.
Liam: Yeah. I regret zip. [end of transcription]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone and welcome to Critical Role an online show on Twitch where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm the Dungeon Master. For returning fans, welcome, and for new folks, prepare. A couple of fun things to announce: first things first, unfortunately we are down a Percy this evening. Our buddy Taliesin picked up a con plague in Alaska this past weekend. He had a great time, but came back very ill and has been trying to get better, and is unable to make the game tonight. Which makes the current storyline a little interesting, but we'll work it out. It's fine. No Mercy Percy is going to have some business he's attending to. Thank the Critters for that. That's an awesome hashtag! So Taliesin, I hope you feel better. We miss you. Next week we continue that arc. Let's see, first and foremost, still every 100 subs we get on the channel we have a giveaway to someone who's active in the chatroom. The winner of that giveaway gets a signed picture of the cast of Critical Role, as well as a signed poster by our amazing artist Kit Buss, who was with us for our last session. Those are both given away to whoever wins that, so keep those subs going. Also, there is currently going around a hashtag: No Shave 'Til 10k. A number of people on the stream are a part of that. All sexes can compete and be a part of this, too. No Shave 'Til 10k. If you want to be a part of that, go ahead and tweet that out. Get that hashtag going and I'll see if I can convince Marisha to let me do that. We'll see. At the very least, for my Halloween costume. All right, so other cool things to talk about: all of tonight's donations are going towards the Extra Life charity. The Extra Life charity is a drive that's part of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. A lot of great people in the community have been supporting this and we're supporting that tonight. So any donations tonight will go to Extra Life. Also over the next two days, we will also be streaming here at Geek and Sundry doing a lot of other charity events for the Extra Life charity drive, including a small DND game-- some of us-- on Saturday evening with the Vox Moronica crew. So that should be fun. Come check that out! Oh, Dungeons and Dragons, the official Wizards of the Coast folks are also doing their Extra Life stream over the next 48 hours. They're just going to be doing live DND streams as well. So starting tomorrow at noon through Sunday at noon, just constant DND on the Wizards of the Coast stream as well. And all of that is going to be raising money for Extra Life. So you'll have a lot of things to keep you busy this weekend essentially. So there's that. Also, we have New York Comic Con coming up in just a couple of weeks. Excited about that, for all you guys. We have panels on Saturday. Do we have times for those yet?
Liam: Between 1 00 and 4 00 is when we're doing stuff.
Matt: Yeah, between 1 00 and 4 00. We have about an hour panel in there somewhere and then probably two hours of signings at the event on Saturday. So 1:00 and 4:00! Leave that period of time open. Hang out.
Marisha: We'll have prints!
Matt: Exactly! And then on Sunday, outside of the convention, because we know a lot of the badges were snatched up before this announcement even happened and a lot of the Critters aren't able to make it to the actual con. On Sunday, we're looking around midday. We don't have a time or location determined yet, but that will be up on Twitter soon. It's going to happen. We're going to have an offsite Critter meetup. Where we're going to all be able to be there, hang out with you guys and catch up, sign stuff, say hi, and have a good time. So watch Twitter. If you don't follow us on Twitter, do it, because we'll have those announcements coming up very soon. So excited about that. Liam, you wanted to announce--
Liam: Yes! This is the final chance for y'all to jump on Joe Madureira's Kickstarter, Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They have absolutely killed their Kickstarter. They hit their goal, their initial goal about two or three days in, and they have been hitting every single stretch goal they've had. They've got one last mystery stretch goal left to hit. So it's a good time to get in and just get them to the very tippy, tippy top of their campaign, which is about to end. If you guys don't know, really quick, because I've been talking about it for two weeks: Joe Madureira, amazing comic book legend, has drawn everything. It looks like nobody else's and has a good history in game dev as well. Created Darksiders with his company, Vigil Games, that he helped found. And now he has founded Airship Syndicate, and they're making an RPG in the style of JRPGs that you've loved in your lives. But also with Joe's ridonkulous art style. So go get on it.
Matt: Yeah! Thank you, Liam. Orion, you wanted to say something real fast as well.
Orion: Yes. Greetings and salutations, everyone! Last week when Kit was here-- Hi Kit, we miss you! We went to It's a Wrap over in Burbank, California. Me and Liam and Laura and Marisha and Kit and her hubby. We were there and saw this robe, and I think Marisha and Laura were like, try it on, and I was like, okay. And I tried it on and was like, oh my god, it was made for me.
Matt: The Tiberius robe you always knew-- or didn't know you wanted.
Orion: Yeah, totally, I was like, oh my god, and Liam tweeted a picture about it, and then I was streaming on my stream on Twitch and somebody mentioned the robe. And Michael Bauman-- thank you again, I'm going to thank you on Critical Role for-- he donated $400, which was the cost of the robe, and then he just wrote in the chat, this is for the robe, so I'm wearing the robe.
Laura: That's awesome!
Orion: Thank you very much. Thank you so much you guys and all you guys who pitched in and stuff. Thank you.
Matt: We'll find many cool excuses to have that robe be displayed and utilized in many ways. I'm pretty sure he hasn't taken it off since he got it.
Laura: Yeah, it smells really bad, you guys.
Matt: Awesome! Anybody else have any other announcements before we get this party started?
Travis: I like cheese.
Matt: Travis likes cheese, ladies and gentlemen.
Laura: That's a good announcement.
Matt: I think so. It was very informative. Thank you, Travis. All right, then. Without further ado, let's go ahead and cut to the intro and then we'll jump right into the next episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back! So picking up after the events of last week, to give you guys a little bit of a refresher. After the party had returned from their journey into Vasselheim for quite a few weeks, they discovered upon returning that the illustrious Briarwoods, current owners of Castle Whitestone and overseers of the entire city of Whitestone and sticking point in Percy's background, were coming to Emon to meet for essentially a political banquet with Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei to discuss construction of a bridge. It was a very political endeavor. And the council of Tal'Dorei was invited, including Vox Machina. There was a week of preparation in going into this event to see exactly what the Briarwoods were about. Information was gathered at this banquet. Vax went on his own little adventure into the Briarwoods' room, in which they nearly killed him. (chuckles)
Liam: Hey, everybody!
Matt: I didn't notice the shirt until now. So yeah, the party rushed out to his aid. Much violence ensued. The Briarwoods eventually escaped through some sort of magical means that was not uncovered. However, they are no longer in the picture. The party was left with a destroyed carriage, a young carriage driver who had his hand shot off by Percy, and was then told to the guards to haul off and bring to their keep to throw into their cell for further questioning. Uriel was eventually drawn out and confused by the sudden chaos and vehemently requested that Vox Machina return the next morning to go over what has transpired. After which, the party during this event had encountered a tiefling by the name of Lillith, who was masquerading as one of the servants within the palace of Tal'Dorei. Aided them in the battle and revealed that she was being hunted by her sisters in a distant land and revealing herself here essentially opened up her physical presence to be pinpointed and then immediately sought and hunted by whoever was after her. The party then brought her back to the keep. They were on the way back before they were encountered by this bounty hunter and a small team of individuals that were coming with him to seek down, capture Lillith, and bring her back to her sisters. The party then defended her in this circumstance, brutally murdering one of them. Sorry, brutally murdering two of them. One of which was then raised and sent off as a present to the sisters by Lillith. One was salvaged, not given an honorable death, and sent to find his way somewhere northwest of Emon. Possibly towards Vasselheim or wherever else he may find his adventure. They then gave Lillith the opportunity to come stay the night to rest in the keep and they all made their way back to Greyskull Keep for the evening. And that was where we left off. So as the evening progresses you all manage to get your rest and gather your thoughts over the rather stressful experience you had the previous evening within the palace. The next morning comes around. You all come to consciousness. Breakfast is prepared by the servants of the keep. As you all wake up, start getting your meals and gathering what you want to do for the day, two individuals have not come down for their meal. Lillith and Percy.
Orion: Good morning, everyone!
Sam: Not everyone. We're missing two. A male and a female.
Laura: Oh. No.
Travis: You don't think?
Laura: Percy was upset.
Sam: Maybe he needed some comforting.
Orion: Oh, I see. Are you saying they're having relations?
Sam: I'm not saying that.
Laura: Perhaps we should check on them?
Travis: We should totally check on them!
Sam: Okay, but if there's a sock or a gun on the doorknob, don't go in.
Laura: Or a ribbon. She wore a ribbon.
Orion: Well, I was thinking last night, Grog, that we're probably going to be here for a little bit before going anywhere. Do we go anywhere?
Laura: We have to go see Uriel.
Orion: Who? Oh. Right! Yes! Also, I really want to see Allura. For no particular-- actually for very specific reasons. Yes.
Travis: I think he's lying.
Orion: One of them is  I want to pick up one of the Earrings of Telecommunication. It has been finished for quite some time. We just have to go to where she resides to pick it up. Then one of us could have another one.
Liam: That robe just takes it to a whole new level!
Laura: Yeah, it really does.
Orion: I feel so good.
Liam: I'm somewhat entranced.
Orion: I'm telling you, it's helping, too.
Travis: Do I feel a little tingle from my belt? And can I roll for a beard check?
Sam: Oh, beard check?
Travis: Six. Two.
Matt: You wake up, realizing that the morning has transpired. You reach up and grab. And what you guys notice as he comes up is there is a dark charcoal smear across one side of his face where facial hair would once be, to match the other side that is currently beautiful quaff and shining in the dapples of morning light that come through the keep window.
Travis: You know the remedy for it, you just turn your face in the looking glass.
Laura: Yeah, from this angle you look amazing Grog.
Travis: My god, I'm so handsome. Right? And then just horror. Sheer horror.
Orion: (poof) A little dust and fix that for him.
Laura: Oh, so it looks normal again? I like it! Yeah. Beautiful. Don't touch it.
Matt: The color's a little off, but it looks better than not having it.
Marisha: In my head you're like those Mr. Wooly magnetic toys when you're a kid.
Travis: I would shave it and get it even, but let's be honest, given history, it's going to take care of itself soon enough. These things don't live very long.
Laura: I'm going to go upstairs and see if our guest, Lillith, is all right. I don't want to disturb Percy just yet.
Matt: All right. You head to the guest room. You have one guest room upstairs that was among the rest of the rooms that you guys had constructed.
Travis: (singing) They're going to be getting it on!
Matt: You knock on the door. A moment passes. No response.
Laura: Lillith? Are you with Percy? Lillith?
Matt: You knock a second time and the door (creaks) opens a little bit. It has not really been locked or closed.
Laura: I peek my head in.
Matt: You peek in and look.
Travis: Did you check for traps?
Matt: Roll a-- no, I'm kidding. (laughter)
Laura: Damn it!
Matt: Already off! No. As you peek into the room, the lights are dimmed. What little bit of candles are in there are already down. Glancing in, the sheets are clean and set, the bed's been made, and there is a small piece of parchment that is folded on the edge of the bed.
Laura: Go and read it.
Matt: Read it? It reads, "Vox Machina, thank you all for your hospitality and protection through this past evening. I would stay, but the longer I remain, the more danger I am in, and as such, put all of you in as well. I shall travel across the Ozmit Sea to seek the guidance of my cousin Zahra, in hopes of finally getting out from under my sisters' baneful gaze. Nevertheless, I wish you all the finest of journeys, and I hope we meet again soon. Lillith."
Laura: She's so cute.
Marisha: I liked her bow. It was cute.
Laura: I tell everyone that she's gone. Gone.
Travis: No, she's in Percy's room! Scanlan, let's go see if he's banging!
Sam: All right, let's go! (laughter)
Matt: You run up and Percy's room is-- the door is already partially ajar.
Travis: (boom)
Matt: It bursts open. (wham) Slams on the side of the door, looking in the room. He's not there, is the first thing you notice. However, what you do see are a series of different books of sketches and designs and half-concocted blueprints for different things are crumpled and torn across the room. The bedsheets are thrown off the bed. It looks like the room has been continuously tossed through some sort of frenzied action, either seeking something or just out of emotional frustration. This room is left in far more disarray than you're used to seeing true to Percy's character.
Sam: My god, Grog. Percy's a hoarder.
Travis: Right.
Sam: Or he's in serious distress.
Travis: I think it's the previous.
Sam: The hoarder?
Travis: Yeah. Probably.
Sam: We must find him, don't you think? Our friend's in trouble. I proceed down to his tinkering lab. Doesn't he have some sort of lab downstairs?
Travis: My room's like shit, and I'm not in trouble.
Sam: Well, that goes with your character.
Matt: Yeah. You head down to the basement area, and to the right is the cell, to the left is the workshop. The workshop door is currently closed. There is a small slider eye vent where you can peek through.
Sam: Can I reach the eye vent?
Matt: You can if you leap hard enough and catch it on the edge.
Travis: I boost him up.
Matt: Okay. Looking inside, you can see, the forge is aglow. You hear the tangs of metal being hammered against the anvil, and you can see the form of Percy framed against the backlighting of the forge. He's feverishly working away on some sort of project.
Travis: Is he naked?
Sam: No, he's working too hard. Maybe we should just leave him be. Seems focused, driven, like a madman.
Travis: Oh. I get it. Like a madman?
Sam: I don't think you do.
Matt: At which point a voice rings out from across the room: Percy unmoving, still continuing his work, shouts over his shoulder, "Please, leave me be. I have a lot to think about right now."
Sam: Would you like a meal brought down?
Matt: "I'm fine. Thank you. Really. I need some time."
Sam: All right. If you're making things, a little ladder for the little perch here might be nice. Just in the future! But not now. That seems low priority.
Matt: He stops his banging, walks over and scribbles something on a paper, then goes back to banging. "Noted." (clanging)
Travis: I drop Scanlan and I lean in and I go, beware the water! It burns!
Matt: "Yes. Yes, it does, Grog. Good boy."
Sam: All right. So we go back up. Tell the fellows, Percy's in a mood. He's creating right now. I think we should just leave him be.
Laura: Understandable.
Liam: Let him get it out of his system.
Marisha: I'm really worried about him.
Sam: Yes.
Orion: Matthew? Rolling-- 12. I'm just trying to teach my pet something but I rolled a 12.
Matt: For?
Orion: Oh, I want it to follow. To follow.
Matt: To follow. Okay. You gather, based on the recent intensity of trying to teach things to Lockheed over the past week. You succeed in a few. There is a bit of balking frustration that perhaps you've overstepped a little bit, and Lockheed feels maybe there's less of a friendship here more than a real master-servant relationship, at least in this moment, and does not seem to be receptive to your attempt.
Orion: He's in a mood, also. Why is everybody in a mood today?
Sam: I know. Percy's hate-smelting downstairs.
Laura: Percy has good reason to hate-smelt. He seems rather disturbed that the Briarwoods got away.
Sam: Yes. I feel responsible.
Marisha: Out of curiosity, did anyone else hear him-- did anyone else just happen to hear what he said in that fight last night?
Laura: I was a little bit preoccupied by watching him shoot a servant boy over and over and over again.
Marisha: It was after that, actually.
Laura: What did he say?
Marisha: Never mind.
Sam: What? No, spit it out. What did he say? It seems important.
Marisha: It's hard to say. You know Percy. I don't know where he gets these lines.
Sam: Is it fuck? Is it shit?
Travis: Cock! Bulls! Dong! Wang!
Liam: Steampunk!
Marisha: Jeez. Okay.
Travis: Donkey wang!
Marisha: This is getting really off subject.
Orion: I'm going to go down to my laboratory.
Laura: What did he say?
Marisha: It was when he was screaming the cluster of things as he was shooting that mercenary in the face, and he said, "What are you doing? You have no reason to be here. Your soul is now forfeit." Really, that last part is the most important one. The first stuff is fairly average. But yeah, "Your soul is now forfeit."
Travis: It's a good line.
Laura: It's a really good line.
Sam: Thought he was just trash-talking. You think there's more to it?
Marisha: I thought it was maybe a line and then it seemed really aggressive and strong and specific, so it made me think a lot. I don't know.
Laura: Did you ask him about it at all?
Marisha: We haven't seen him since that happened.
Travis: What do you think?
Laura: What, do you think his Pepperbox is-- what?
Marisha: I think he's not telling us everything, that's for sure.
Sam: Well, we all have some secrets.
Marisha: Yeah. But screaming, "Your soul is now forfeit?" That's not a secret. That's saying you peed the bed when you were a kid.
Liam: I worry, too, but he did lose his entire family.
Laura: He did pee the bed when he was a kid.
Marisha: Oh, really?
Liam: I am assuming. But he lost his entire family to those people.
Marisha: Sure. But he wasn't screaming this at the Briarwoods. He was screaming this at a random mercenary.
Laura: Well?
Marisha: What does that mean?
Travis: Maybe his soul is forfeit.
Marisha: To what?
Travis: Death?
Laura: Maybe we keep an eye on Percy.
Sam: That's a fair point, though. We'll keep an eye on him. He seems to be in a fragile state right now.
Laura: Percy's not the one who killed a poor old woman, though.
Sam: Did we kill her? I thought we just made her sleep and then walked away.
Travis: Nope. No. Total massacre.
Laura: Tiberius destroyed her.
Sam: Tiberius, you killed an old woman?
Orion: I'm not there.
Marisha: Yeah, that's actually another thing I wanted to talk about. That was also really intense. You know, I get it. It was a hard day. It was a hard day, and we tend to get a little aggressive sometimes after hard days. We've all been there. But he didn't just murder an old woman. He chainsawed her. A sleeping, unconscious woman.
Travis: It was pretty great!
Sam: Are you saying that we should take it down a notch? Or maybe not brutally destroy the bad guys?
Marisha: You also were the only other one who seemed to be confused as to what was going on.
Laura: I shot her. I shot her in the back. Let's be honest. I didn't chainsaw her, but I did shoot her in the back as she was running away.
Sam: I made her go to sleep. That was peaceful.
Marisha: That's what I'm saying. That was good. That was nice.
Laura: I was aiming for her shoulder, if it makes any difference.
Travis: She did have that sweet little run, which was so cute.
Sam: Are you taking moral exception to some of our behavior?
Marisha: That might exactly be what I'm saying. Man, you see this is why I like you, Scanlan. You're so much better at the words than me. I don't think I even knew that's what I felt until you said it just now.
Sam: Well, this is something perhaps you should pray on and think on. If there's something you'd like us to change about our behavior, we can consider that. We're all friends. We're allies here. We should pay respect to you.
Marisha: I just don't want us to--
Liam: It's a fair point. We don't want to be corrupted by the very evil that we mean to stamp out in this world. She was trying to kill us. But your point is taken.
Marisha: She was a really old woman.
Liam: But she wasn't the secretary. She was trying to kill.
Marisha: Sure. But she was unconscious.
Travis: She actually didn't do anything, either.
Marisha: Yeah, she didn't really do anything at all.
Travis: She could have been taking notes.
Laura: She had a wand!
Marisha: I'm not saying she wasn't a threat and I'm not saying we shouldn't handle threats. I'm saying maybe we shouldn't dissect a woman with a spinning Krull blade who's sleeping on the ground. Defenseless, running away. She was fleeing.
Sam: All right. You know, this is constructive criticism, and we'll take it as such. And I, for one, will maybe not desecrate and denigrate bodies.
Laura: Just beds! And temples. (laughs)
Liam: I don't know! I mean, I see what Keyleth's saying, but I don't really want to cramp your style, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, I'll shit on things. Maybe not people.
Liam: We're like the A-Team, and that's your specialty. I don't really want to-- See, you should just shit when you feel the urge.
Laura: What time is it? Do we need to be getting to Uriel?
Travis: Oh yeah, what time is it?
Matt: At this point, it's probably pushing on 11 am, close to noon.
Laura: We should probably be getting to the palace.
Matt: Tiberius, what did you say you were doing down there? What did you say you were doing down in your laboratory?
Orion: Well, I was doing my research on that stuff last night and this morning.
Matt: Your which one?
Orion: It's just my ability because of my class. I do the backstory.
Matt: Your backstory is?
Orion: I am a noble sage.
Matt: Well, there's a noble and there's a sage.
Orion: Yeah, I know, and I spliced them because it made sense. No. The noble part is the RP. The sage is the perk.
Matt: Okay. Gotcha. That's good to know. All right.
Orion: And I was writing down the sigil to the keep. That's completed.
Matt: Okay. So the sigil is there for you. All right. And so as the sage-- All right. Okay. So yeah. Not difficult to research. There are a number of books. They're older books and things that were installed as part of the construction of this laboratory for you, and information that you have gathered since. There are various bestiaries and gatherings of information about the dangerous denizens in the countryside around you, and it is a very dangerous place outside of the few points of civilized society that has built up its own defenses. Throughout the evening and the morning, you've managed to find eventually a piece that talks about various undead entities and the process of undeath, and necromantic magics that have been perverted throughout the generations to defy the natural cycle of life. You do come across an entry about vampirism. It is extremely rare and was largely thought abolished close to 200 years ago. There are very rare whispers of any sort of cases out there, and usually as soon as something comes to any sort of public knowledge, large mobs gather and whoever was infected with this horrible state was hunted down and killed. What you do learn from this is religious symbology, while classically thought to have an effect on people afflicted with vampirism, actually has no effect. It's more of a superstition, but does not actually have any negative impact on the individual. However, certain things that do render a vampire easier to destroy: the presence of sunlight. Anything that counts as sunlight can damage them progressively the longer they're in it, prevent them from restoring their health, and ultimately destroy them and turn them to ash, should they be brought to the brink of death in the presence of sunlight. Also, very quickly and consistently rushing water. Being held into a rushing stream or under a waterfall would have a similar effect to sunlight. You do also know the stake in the heart is also considered to be a way to destroy them. It does not actually destroy them, but it does render them paralyzed and has to be done when they're in their resting place, within their coffin and/or the dirt that is considered their resting location. Usually that is the beginning step: to find and locate where the vampire is resting, stake in the heart, and then carry the body to sunlight or rushing water. And that's how they're permanently destroyed. You also find out that if a vampire is thought to be killed under any other circumstances, the body turns to mist and is nigh invulnerable and eventually finds its way back to wherever they've hidden their resting place to recover within a very short period of time, making them extremely dangerous, unless you have the right situation, the right conditions, to bring them to that point. So that information is now at your disposal.
Orion: Wonderful.
Travis: Do you want to tell us what you've learned?
Orion: I did it right this time! Knowing that, I take some files and-- I want to check if I can-- Nope. I can't do anything yet. That's it. I'm going to go upstairs.
Matt: Okay. So as you guys have gathered the time and what you might be, going forward, doing for the rest of the day, Tiberius comes upstairs with a bit of a smile and an air of confidence.
Laura: Oh good, you're back.
Liam: Tibs, we were just discussing the future of the group and the direction we've been taking. And a point was introduced that maybe perhaps, we started as a sort of a-- mercenary group is a bit strong-- but this alliance we have formed out of convenience. We all needed to eat. But now that we're at the stature we are, in a keep, in Emon. Friends to the emperor. We want to figure out what we're doing here. Do we want to be just powerful badasses who walk around getting what they want, or are we trying to enact some positive change in this world?
Orion: Yes, absolutely. That's what my items are for. I've only found one of them. There are still three or four, if they even exist out there. There are countless things to go and venture forth and explore.
Travis: What? Your items?
Orion: The artifacts, the Ring of Boros, the old hag. That is the next step in my quest. She told us it would be in the Feywood. Right?
Matt: Feywild. Close. Researcher.
Orion: That is where we need to go. But that's why we ran into her in Vasselheim, and she wouldn't tell me anything more.
Marisha: How do you plan to use your items? For better good in the world?
Orion: Well, you've seen how I've used my Mending Wheel. Countless ways.
Travis: Yeah, thank you. You healed my cask. I'll always be grateful.
Orion: Moreover, it would prove to the council that all of the things that I went on this journey for to begin with, it was true. Or for naught. And really, to gain the respect of my father and everyone else. You don't know how hard it is to be a chromatic dragon in a metallic world! It's not easy.
Liam: Well, there's no question that you are an invaluable member of Vox Machina, and our friend, and our family. And that is not in question.
Orion: Of course. Which is why I have pledged my loyalty to you all. And I need your strength, as well. There is no way I could accomplish in my mission alone. I mean, Grog, when I ran into you in that one bar. How many men were you beating up? I counted eight, if I recall.
Travis: I think that sounds right.
Sam: He can't count.
Travis: It's that many.
Orion: Here was this brute who I would have ran away from, but here you were, and I found you to be rather charming. I figured, well, that's some good company to keep, rather. And then I met the rest of you, and look where we are now!
Laura: Yes. Tiberius, the point of this is you killed an old woman last night, very brutally. Please maybe don't do that again.
Orion: She felt nothing, but of course. And I was giving my new Krull blade a good old try.
Laura: Yes, you were. Maybe not on sleeping people anymore. People who are actually attacking us.
Orion: She was-- okay, fine.
Liam: Well, I think the point is your abilities in arcane wonder are expanding daily. Exponentially. And perhaps be a little tentative. Do a little practice run in the woods on your own, once in a while, and see what the effects are before you go whipping it out.
Orion: Are there woods nearby?
Sam: This is an intervention. We love you very much, but you killed an old lady.
Travis: I like the way you kill people.
Orion: Well, yes.
Laura: We're all on the up and up now, right?
Orion: One raises a hand to me or Vox Machina, they are going to die.
Travis: Yeah! Yeah, they are!
Orion: It is simple. I do not know why this is a discussion. I won't be as cruel--
Marisha: You know, she didn't even really do anything. She was really old.
Laura: She was attacking us.
Liam: Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Liam: Clearly, we all love you as family, and nobody blames you, but you once killed a child, and none of us blame you for that.
Travis: Is it too early to start drinking? I pull out the cask of ale.
Liam: And that happened in the heat of battle.
Marisha: You know, I'm really sensitive about that, Vax. I'm really sensitive about that, Vax!
Liam: I'm well aware.
Marisha: And that was different.
Laura: It was an accident!
Marisha: That was pretty fucking deliberate, what he did.
Orion: Yes, to someone who was opposing us. That was a child who was innocent. Or was he opposing us, too? I don't remember, actually.
Liam: And it all falls apart.
Marisha: He was being puppeted by sorcerer Michael Jackson.
Liam: No one agrees with you today more than I, and I think we can adjust our perspective slightly. Right, Grog?
Travis: What's the word?
Liam: See?
Sam: Kill softer.
Orion: I'll show you how. You just have to do it really slow.
Laura: Uriel's waiting for us.
Sam: Let's table this. We'll stick a pin in this discussion. We'll all be thinking long and hard about this.
Laura: Keyleth, it wasn't intentional and everybody knows that.
Liam: Absolutely. Not intentional. No.
Marisha: I turn into Minxie and start walking.
Travis: Minxie! I go and give a little scratch behind the ears.
Matt: You guys gather and make your way into the city of Emon proper.
Laura: Actually, before we head towards Uriel, we probably should-- do we have any sort of proof that the Briarwoods actually did horrible things and it wasn't us attacking them?
Liam: Well, I've got these little scars right here.
Matt: The scars are still there. They're still wounds that are healing.
Laura: All right. Cool. Just making sure that we had something.
Liam: And then there was what's-his-name, Awesome Pants, who was there.
Laura: Seeker Asum.
Orion: Allura saw everything, as well.
Sam: Did she see the fight?
Laura: Allura didn't see the fight.
Liam: We know she knows what's up, but whether she can be used as a reliable witness is-- we've got multiple witnesses.
Sam: There were those guards, too. There was guards outside the door.
Liam: They were incinerated.
Sam: Oh yeah.
Laura: Plus, they were the Briarwoods' guards, anyway.
Orion: One of them was still alive. I didn't kill both of them.
Laura: He went away with the Briarwoods, I'm going to assume.
Travis: What a dick! We go to see Uriel.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I made a choice for the team! (laughter)
Matt: As you're having this discussion, all of you make your way into the city of Emon, across the districts to the Cloudtop. You're greeted and let within the gate into the central district there. You make your way to the palace of Tal'Dorei, through the front doors. The guards that are there lead you in and one of them says, "Uriel is waiting within the throne chamber." You guys are led down the main hallway into the very center of the palace.
Marisha: I come out of Minxie.
Matt: The nervous guard, thankfully, puts his weapon away and is like, "Oh! Lady Keyleth, my apologies." And puts his spear to the side.
Laura: Trinket's still here, though.
Liam: I buzz over to that specific guard and say, do you have a lost and found here? I have this really badass serpent-style belt. Sometimes it crawls around on its own. Sometimes it's just a belt. And I lost it here the other night. And I'm really hoping-- I mean, it ties everything together. Is there anyone I can check with?
Matt: "Check back after you've spoken with the Sovereign, please. Thank you." Leads you guys on. As you head down the main hallway-- and you recall this hallway. This was a long, dangerous trek the first time you came to the palace. This was where Uriel's family was possessed. This is where you had your battle with the glabrezu. This is where Pike was slain. This is where you had to pull the shadows from the bodies of his family. This is a very emotional place that you really haven't been to since that sequence of events. Walking in already has this tenuous state of low-simmering energy. As you're brought into the main chamber, you can see there is the dual thrones for Uriel and his wife. His wife is not present; his family is not present, just Uriel sitting on the throne. There are a few guards on the different entrances to the room. As you walk in, Uriel just sits there on the throne and gives you acknowledgment and ushers you into the room. You all step in. Trinket behind you keeping an eye out. Like a bear is wont to do. You guys make your way up towards the very edge of the central raised dais where the thrones are currently set up on. You now see on the opposite side of the room, Seeker Asum and Allura walk in, as well as Arbiter Brom, who is the cleric that is the Master of Law in the city. They walk up and flank the sides of the throne, stepping back a little bit to not gather all the attention, but definitely be there as a show of support. As they enter, the doors on the other side of the room and the door behind you open, and roughly 30 guards enter the chamber quietly. They all filter in, blocking all the exits. The doors close. No weapons are drawn, but there is a very strong showing of muscle in this room that you weren't expecting for this meeting. Once all the guards are settled and a really awkward silence hits the room, Uriel stands up from the throne and looks upon you. Pacing slightly, back and forth. "Thank you all for joining me. I must say, I am troubled by recent events, and I wish to speak to you regarding them before taking any action. I owe you that much for all you've done for me. Before you left for Vasselheim, you showed immediate interest in the Briarwoods. Percy in-- Where is Percival?"
Sam: Well, he's not feeling well today after the events of last night, so he stayed behind.
Matt: "Well, then please relay this conversation to him as soon as you see him. You exhibited interest in the Briarwoods before leaving for Vasselheim. I, through trust, did not inquire as to why. But upon your return, eagerly told you they were coming to this feast and invited you as part of the Council of Tal'Dorei to join this feast, as it was your request. I graciously followed through. You showed up. A meal was had. Questions were asked, although curious ones; I did not pry. Now I have since been notified, and seen a bit of the aftermath, that you, Vox Machina, seemingly attacked our guests shortly-- please. Listen. Attacked our guests shortly after the meal in their own guest quarters. Forcing them to flee, after you destroyed the hallway, ruined their carriage, murdered two of their guards, two more outside, and leaving Seeker Asum to witness this entire process." Asum gives a nod. "You then tortured their carriage driver, requested he be sent to the dungeon beneath your keep. And upon my sentries returning from Greyskull to deliver him, they find a freshly murdered old woman not far behind the path you took. Not long after, Seeker Asum found me and corroborated most of this unexpected, violent behavior. I then asked Arbiter Brom here to divine the nature of this murder. And through his divine sight, through the goddess Ioun, comes to tell me it was none other than you, Tiberius, that slaughtered this elderly woman while she slept."
Orion: Yes!
Matt: "Now, I am quite disturbed by the events of these past 14 hours, and I would like to hear an explanation. Arbiter, if you could please, prepare the space." Arbiter Brom steps forward and pulls forth from underneath his robes a necklace that contains a holy symbol. The same symbol you saw across the temple beneath the Slayer's Take, an eye-like inscription of the god Ioun. Brom grasps it, looks about you all, and prepares this slight hand gesture, and you feel a slight tingle across the skin that lasts a few seconds.
Marisha: Can I recognize the spell he's casting?
Matt: I'll say go ahead and make a-- this would be a religion check.
Marisha: He's doing a cleric thing, yeah? Seven.
Matt: All right. Unable to ascertain the nature. However, the incantation completes. No seeming noticeable effect. Brom nods and steps back in the line of the thrones. I want all of you guys to roll charisma saving throws.
Marisha: Son of a bitch. Always a problem.
Orion: 19.
Marisha: 11.
Sam: I get advantage, and I rolled a 27.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. Bards.
Liam: 19.
Laura: 13.
Travis: 18.
Matt: All right. Good to know. Uriel then looks to the rest of you. "So. I've said my piece for the moment. Explain."
Liam: I step forward.
Marisha: Can I do a quick insight check on Asum to see if I can still recognize if he's still affected by the mind-control thing?
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check, sure.
Marisha: Ooh yeah! 28.
Matt: Glancing at Asum, the way he's looking at you and the general tension and feeling of the room, you gather that Asum is not his normal self completely. You step forward.
Liam: Uriel. With all respect, I needn't remind you what the group of people before you put themselves through on your behalf and your family's behalf. We almost lost one of our own. And if that counts for nothing here, then nothing makes sense. But if that is not enough, let us start here.
Orion: The Briarwoods are vampires. And that old lady, who was a butthole by the way, was with this demonoid person who we had to fight as well.
Liam: One thing at a time. That's true, but one thing at a time. We had prior knowledge of the Briarwoods' intentions before this evening. And I myself went to spy on them.
Laura: Here's the thing. Percy doesn't like them because they killed his family. They took over his home, after killing his family. He got away. He knows they're scary. We're trying to protect you.
Orion: So the point is, we all know how dangerous it is that the knowledge of vampire existence and the spreading of those vile creatures. And now we know they do exist. So however the means that that came about is neither here nor there. We know where they are.
Travis: And if you're wondering how we know they're vampires-- (whispering) Vax, this is your cue.
Liam: I will subject myself to any test, to any wizard or mage in this city who you know can ascertain the truth. To look through my eyes, to see my memories. I don't know shit about magic, but there are people who do.
Sam: Cleric Tristan also treated him last night for his vampire-inflicted wound. I know this all looks really bad on the surface, and we did not want to cause any disturbance within these hallowed walls, but there was a danger, we acted. Perhaps too abruptly and without telling you.
Laura: We tried to get your attention. I called for you immediately. As soon as we knew there was danger.
Liam: And don't take our word for it. Anyone, have them look in here.
Orion: Actually, you take a Stormwind's word for--
Matt: "Silence! Silence. You're in my court now, Stormwind. You put so much weight upon this trust, and you have done a good service. But also I've heard whispers that you've thrown this trust around in many circles. Remember, we held a parade in your honor; we spread the word of the good deeds you've done. We, at our own costs of Emon, built you a keep, a home, at great expense, to show thanks. And also, I believed, upon allowing you to join the council, put us square. I owe you nothing. Just as you owe me nothing."
Liam: Do you not want the truth?
Matt: "I want the truth, but I also want you to understand the stakes that are here and why there is this question. As the leader of this-- not this city, but this entire countryside, I have to be sure, and this is not the first time I have been lied to by very close, trusted people, so I have to be thorough."
Liam: This is why I offer myself completely into your control and put myself under your supervision and any user of the arcane arts you want to peer inside my mind, let them step up to the plate, because I have nothing to hide.
Laura: Also, while you are inquiring about him, you might inquire about Seeker Asum.
Sam: If you're worried about lies within your own ranks, I think you should start with him.
Marisha: In fact, I actually might be able to help Seeker Asum, if you will allow me to.
Sam: Help him?
Matt: You glance over at Asum, and Asum gives a look to Uriel and Uriel--
Laura: He was mind-controlled last night.
Matt: "I have had Asum at my side for the better part of 15 years. He is responsible, far more than your merry band has ever attempted, for keeping and maintaining the good and lawful state of this country."
Liam: Uriel, your own family was not themselves! And you know that! Look into my mind! Now! Today! You don't need to guess anything.
Matt: "It would also do you well to show respect. We are speaking, half-elf. Now, I would assign Allura to such an endeavor. However, it has also been noticed that she has grown quite friendly and attached to your group, and in this circumstance, there is question. So you will be, in a few days, assigned an individual to this ritual of which you are presenting yourself."
Marisha: Uriel, please--
Matt: "Shh. The Briarwoods, regardless of what you may think they may be, or we do-- that will show in time-- have shown nothing over the past five years but graciousness, and gone through all proper channels to establish this relationship between our city and theirs. Far more than the previous family ever attempted."
Liam: Well, one may smile and smile and still be a villain.
Matt: "That goes both ways. Now, please."
Marisha: Just let me do a quick restoration spell on Asum. If nothing is wrong with him, nothing will happen. It's harmless. It's like taking medicine when you're not sick. It can't hurt. And if I am wrong, then we can continue on. We can have Vax tested. Please, it'll take ten minutes. What can it hurt?
Laura: Up until last night, he was himself. Trust us that now he is not.
Marisha: He came to us.
Matt: "There has been nothing about his behavior, at all, to insinuate any change of anything of the sort. And I have known the man for quite some time, before I even took this throne. However, I will, in the good graces and the relationship we forged, allow this. Asum, are you all right with this?" Asum gives a nod. "Well, if this is to be how it is. Certainly." And he steps forward. The halfling approaches you, looking you in the face. All right. You would like to attempt your Greater Restoration spell?
Marisha: First, I meditate for a second, and I cast Enhance Ability on myself.
Matt: As a note, as you begin casting, you notice the guards all go for their weapons and ready themselves, uncertain of what's about to transpire. There is a tension in the room based on what this is going to be.
Marisha: Can I get some meditation music, Scanlan?
Sam: Oh! (chanting)
Matt: All right. So first you cast Enhance Ability on yourself.
Marisha: Am I maybe inspired by that?
Matt: Sure. In the tension of the room, this slow droning hum of the gnome, which you can notice some of the guards look at each other, confused. And Asum puts his hand up like, hold off.
Liam: It's Tuvan throat singing.
Matt: All right. So first you cast Enhance Ability on your--
Marisha: Self.
Sam: What ability?
Marisha: To enhance wisdom? Wisdom.
Matt: Okay. You reach out with Greater Restoration. You complete the ritual. You touch onto the arms of Asum. It fades, and you see in his eyes there's a moment of clarity and an inhale. A slight gasp, like some realization hits him and his expression changes and looks towards you and just goes-- He puts his hands out like this for a moment, just trying to almost tell you something. Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Just a d20. Or no, make an insight. Make a straight insight. This is more of an insight roll here.
Marisha: Okay. Oh! 29.
Matt: You get the sense through the subtlety of physical motion and expression, Asum is telling you, just go with me on this. He steps back into the place next to the throne. There's a brief moment of pause. Uriel says, "And, Asum?" Asum goes, "My stance has not changed. I know not what she is attempting or thought the situation was, but it appears to me that this was either misinformation or at least at the time being, hopefully, not a lie. But I believe Brom has taken care of that, yes?" And Brom gives a nod. "I certainly have hoped to." Uriel goes, "Hm. All right. Here's the circumstance: as it stands, I fear I must revoke Vox Machina's membership in the council of Tal'Dorei until further notice, for the safety of our countryside and the current tension in our relationship."
Sam: Objection! That's it. I just wanted to say that. Please continue. I just want it noted that we object strongly to this.
Matt: "I understand. And this will only continue until all of our investigations are complete."
Sam: Are we still allowed free rein to roam about as we please? Are we under arrest for anything?
Matt: "You are not under arrest. You are revoked from the council, and you will be closely watched until our investigations are complete."
Laura: How long will your investigations take?
Matt: He looks back to Asum and Asum says, "Well, depends on how quickly we can acquire the information; it could be weeks. I'll do my best to make it thorough and quick."
Laura: Are we allowed to leave the city in that time?
Matt: Uriel looks back and says, "You may leave if you wish. Know that there have been precautions taken. Should you attempt to flee, we will find you."
Liam: And when are you to look into my mind?
Laura: Weirdo! (laughter)
Liam: It freaking ends here. Right away.
Travis: Can you read my mind?
Liam: There is no spoon.
Matt: "We ought to speak to the Lyceum to find a proper individual of sufficient power and trust to do this, as Allura right now is being kept out of the scenario."
Sam: Are we allowed to speak with Allura?
Matt: "If you wish. Outside of these chambers. Do what you must to clear your name. I would like very much for this all to be true, what you're saying. But do not flee. Do not give an inclination that you attempt to escape this judgment, for we will take that as a sign of guilt."
Liam: We've no intention of going anywhere.
Matt: "Should we conclude that your actions were beyond reason and the moral fiber of this council before your return, we will have no choice to put a bounty on your heads, should you not return. I really, really do not wish to do this. Do not make me do this."
Orion: I stand up. "No need for threats, friend. Are we done here?"
Matt: "I want to believe you all. I ask you, show that my trust has not been misplaced all this time. Now, you may leave."
Sam: I look forward to the second parade you'll throw for us after our names are cleared.
Matt: "Very well."
Travis: I turn to the guards that were grabbing at their weapons and I flex real fast at them and then I walk.
Matt: Four of them go, (yelps).
Travis: Bitch! (laughter)
Matt: As you guys go back out the doors that you entered, the guards now a little closely following as you exit, leading you out of the palace, down the front steps, and essentially stand at the front of the palace gates.
Liam: I'm sorry. I was just talking to one of your friends. Have you seen a belt that is shaped like a snake? Sometimes it moves around on its own. And it answers to the name Simon, but usually it's just a belt and looks really cool. Have you seen it? Is there a lost and found I can check out? It's very dear to me.
Matt: The guard just looks for a second and goes, "I think you've got more important matters to deal with before you go looking for a belt, sir."
Liam: Where's that other guy? He was more receptive to this. Do I see that other guy?
Laura: Darling. Seriously.
Matt: The guards all turn around and start ascending the stairs.
Liam: It's on all the fan art. It really makes sense to have it on me.
Matt: They don't appear to be listening.
Liam: Keep an eye out for it. 100 gold to any chap who finds it and holds onto it for me.
Matt: Two of them stop in their step for a second and then keep walking.
Liam: I'm a nice guy! (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.
Travis: You're going to get six belts thrown at you.
Liam: That's terrible. Six.
Matt: It was a brief pause. But also. A brief pause.
Laura: You have a two in persuasion? Oh wow.
Sam: We'll break in tonight and find it.
Travis: Could we wait outside for Allura?
Liam: I'll risk it all.
Matt: All right. So you are now currently there in the cobblestone street of the Cloudtop District, removed from the Council of Tal'Dorei and left in this interesting circumstance.
Sam: Keyleth, what happened? Your magic didn't work?
Marisha: No, it worked.
Laura: What happened?
Sam: But Asum lied.
Orion: He gave her a magic winky face.
Marisha: Yeah, essentially. Yeah. He gave me like a--
Laura: What does that mean? Does that mean Uriel's under their control? I don't understand.
Liam: Is he playing some sort of long game here?
Sam: It must mean that we have something to fear from Uriel. Or someone else close.
Marisha: I don't know who to trust anymore, to be totally honest.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: It worked. I could feel it break. It worked, and he's got some sort of long game. I don't know if it's because he doesn't want Uriel to know, for whatever reason. I don't know if it's because he has some deeper, ulterior motive.
Laura: Do you think he was faking that he was healed, and maybe he wasn't?
Travis: Or maybe we have to bring proof of their vampirism back?
Marisha: No.
Travis: Oh.
Marisha: Wait. No to Vex. What was your question?
Travis: To bring back proof of them being vampires.
Sam: Proof would help. Hey! Don't we have a prisoner? Can't we question the prisoner?
Laura: Is he bleeding out? What if he's dead? We're so screwed!
Marisha: I made sure.
Laura: Yeah, the guy that Percy shot the hand off of.
Marisha: I cauterized his wounds, remember?
Sam: We should question him. He could have proof.
Laura: Oh shit! I hope everything's okay.
Orion: Wait a minute! I really need to go to Allura. She's our best interest right now.
Sam: We get it! You want her body. Now's not the time.
Orion: It is beyond that. There are several reasons to go. We need to get the Earring of Telescription. I need her to enchant something for me, too. As well as the fact I fear that our keep may be in danger. I would like to ask her if she may be able to set up a warding spell for--
Laura: Can you go get her and bring her to the keep? I need to find out if this boy is all right.
Marisha: Well, we can split up. I can go with you.
Matt: As you guys are having this discussion, the palace doors open and you hear the quick footsteps of Allura, rushing from the palace now, running towards you guys.
Laura: Saving the day. Again.
Marisha: Wait, she's coming out of the palace?
Matt: She's coming out of the palace, behind you guys. Like after the council had just closed. The meeting had finished. She basically gave chase to you guys and is now catching up to you on the street.
Sam: What the shit happened in there?
Marisha: We were just talking about you!
Matt: "Everyone-- I don't fully know what happened last night, and--" She looks to you, Tiberius, and says, "You didn't, did you? Please tell me you did not kill that woman."
Orion: Oh, I absolutely did!
Laura: But she was attacking us.
Sam: It looks bad, but she was a threat.
Orion: Her and another one with this-- what was he, a tiefling? Named the Broker attacked us. And that's why I killed her.
Matt: "Brom's divination is very clear. And he divined that the woman was currently filled with fear, attempting to flee, and unconscious when she was murdered."
Liam: How did she flee when she was unconscious?
Travis: She fled, went unconscious, then we butchered her.
Marisha: Just accept it for what it is, guys.
Matt: "I just worry. I know not what happened here, and I heard what you said, and I honestly do not trust the Briarwoods myself either. There was something about that meal and the conversation, and their presence that put me off entirely. It was strange. And what you say makes a lot of sense. Vampirism is a bit beyond what I was expecting. I did sense some powerful masqueraded arcane essence from Lady Briarwood. Look, I would recommend for this to do your best to be thorough in this. Bring back any and all information you can. From the words I hear, you probably have at best a few weeks before this comes to a close. And if you don't have enough evidence to support your argument-- well, I don't know."
Liam: Allura, all I know how to do is break locks, but I've seen these people do things with magic that have defied expectations. Why can no one look into my memory? You have looked across miles. Cannot anyone look into my mind and see?
Laura: They're going to do it!
Sam: Yes, but that might not be proof enough for them. Someone could have corrupted your mind.
Matt: "You have to understand. Not all arcane works that way. There are magics that can dabble in that realm, but none that specialize that here in Emon. Divination, yes there are elements of that. We can see the physical. We can see certain events. But to look into one's mind is a different magic entirely."
Liam: Are there no spells that can divine if someone's speaking true?
Matt: "That was attempted during that council, but after you left, Brom notified Uriel and the Council that many of you were resistant to the spell, and as such, it could not be verified."
Laura: (laughs) We should have rolled low! Just tell us you're doing it, we won't resist it! What the shit? Doesn't even trust us to tell the truth.
Travis: If we came back with proof?
Sam: What sort of proof do you think they would accept? The head of Lady Briarwood?
Laura: No, because it'll disappear the minute we kill her or something. They're vampires, I don't know what they do.
Matt: She gives a thought to that. She goes, "Interestingly enough, if an artifact or an item brought forth from them could be divined, that should tell all."
Marisha: Is there still the remaining wreckage of their carriage? Is that still there?
Matt: "The carriage has been disposed. It's been picked over, and there were remnants within the rubble of some sort of a 'siggle' of teleportation. But that is no-- a sigil, if you will." (laughter)
Travis: What sort of artifact? Like, a brooch? A handbag?
Liam: Are we talking about that motherfucker's teeth?
Orion: I need to see that sigil.
Matt: "Sigil. We're all learning together. That, I believe, has all been investigated and kept under lock and key with Asum. You would have to speak with him. I would like to help. I cannot come with you. I'm working on something else at the moment. Ah!" And she reaches into her pocket and brings out your Earring of Transcription.
Orion: Thank you so much, Lady Allura!
Matt: As she hands it to you, she gives you a really, really concerned look. And just gives it to you and hands it back. And it's a look of-- and it hits you: it's a look of disappointment with a hint of heartbreak.
Travis: Oh, that's the worst! I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. Ugh!
Liam: I feel like I've failed you.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: She looks back to you as you take it and goes, "Do your best to clear your name."
Orion: I shall.
Matt: "I know you come of noble blood, and many of you stand to inspire many others of noble blood. As celebrated heroes of this city, there is a lot more on the line here besides just your well-being. There's a lot of people in this town that look up to you. Nevertheless, I've already said more than I should. Good luck."
Laura: Thank you, Allura.
Matt: She looks behind and you can see she takes this small hood of the same material of her robe that she's wearing and puts it up over her head and rushes off towards her white tower towards the edge of the Cloudtop District.
Liam: Fucking politics.
Sam: No one insight checked her.
Travis: She's telling the truth. Let's go make sure the prisoner isn't dead.
Sam: All right. So wait. What are our avenues? We're going to have to Columbo this. What are our avenues of finding proof?
Laura: We say as we're walking back to the keep.
Sam: We have a prisoner we can question. Who knows if that will yield anything. And then, we might have to go gather evidence, which means leaving town against his word.
Laura: Well, we're allowed to leave town.
Liam: No!
Sam: No!
Laura: Yeah! No! He said we're allowed to leave. We just can't look like we're fleeing, so we tell them where we're going. They can even fucking follow us. I don't care.
Liam: So we tell them that we're going to their political-- the people that they're trying to create a political relationship with? We're just going off to invade your political allies.
Travis: Oh come on! You half-elves. I swear to god! Have you never heard of lying before? Yeah! We don't tell them where we're going. We're going on a field trip. We're going to pick berries. Fuck all, but we go there.
Orion: The only way we can go there is telling them.
Travis: What? And we're going there, what for?
Orion: When I talk to Asum and get that sigil to that damn Briarwood keep. That's how we get there.
Travis: Why don't we say we're taking a picnic-- oh, we took a wrong turn. Hey, it's the Briarwoods!
Orion: We don't have to lie to them. We tell them where we're going, and we can just go there.
Travis: We don't have to if we don't want to.
Liam: You're pretty.
Laura: Especially that beardy side, Grog.
Travis: It's a full beard right now.
Matt: What you do know is the sigil that a teleportation circle is attached to is known when you cast or create the circle. The circle does not necessarily indicate or maintain the sigil it's attached to.
Orion: It's just a piece of it?
Matt: Meaning, there are two parts to it. There is the sigil that it sends to, and there is the actual ritual circle that is created. The circle that attaches to it is not the same as the destination. There are elements of it that connect it, but you would not be able to ascertain a sigil to Whitestone immediately from looking at the initial circle.
Liam: Thanks for the cups, guys! The cup.
Travis: I just noticed that!
Liam: Well, let's go check on this poor little shit in the dungeon.
Sam: And then the next step will be to seek out Seeker Asum?
Orion: I'd like to stop by the temple real quick to pick up my decanter.
Sam: How many errands do you have to run?
Laura: Endless errands.
Sam: All right. Go run your errands! We've got a mystery to solve.
Travis: Yeah, I want to be there when we talk to the prisoner, too.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep. Are you going with them or you're--
Orion: I'm doing all the shit.
Matt: What are you doing?
Sam: He's got a list.
Matt: I would like to know the list.
Orion: I'm going to stop at an armory because I want my crossbow reinforced. I don't know what that means. I want to learn a different sigil. The one that I researched for the waste fair, or for the way-- the Feywild! There's this big city next to it that I researched, that is near it, and in that city might be a sigil. So I'm going to go see if I can learn it. And then I want to come back and start enchanting my blades.
Sam: It's a busy day.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: I can give it to you. I wrote it down.
Sam: Coming soon on Friday nights  The Adventures of Tiberius's Errands! 7:00 to 10:00 every Friday night on Twitch.
Orion: And then I have to go to the dry cleaners for my robe.
Matt: All right. So as you begin that process, the rest of you continue back to the Keep. As you approach Greyskull Keep, there are two individuals waiting for you at the gate that you do not recognize from a distance.
Sam: Wait, what? Say that again.
Matt: There's two individuals waiting for you at the gate. You can see at a distance, but you don't recognize.
Sam: They're our handlers, probably.
Liam: Grog, come on. Let's go have a talk with someone.
Laura: I walk with you.
Sam: We're all going!
Liam: Let's go arm in arm in one big line!
Laura: Well, they're right at our fucking keep. It's not like we're all headed in the same direction, anyway.
Orion: Who doesn't have a ring?
Sam: A ring of what?
Orion: An earring.
Marisha: I have one right now.
Sam: I think I do?
Laura: I have one.
Liam: I have one.
Laura: Grog doesn't have one.
Travis: How far away from the keep are we?
Matt: You're probably a good 100 to 150 feet.
Travis: I whistle really loud and say, who are these fucks in front of the keep? to the guard that we have employed.
Matt: Okay. So. Let me try and see who's on duty right now.
Laura: He has notes on who is on duty.
Matt: This would still be Shayne and Cordell. Cordell shouts down from the top of the wall and says, "I don't think they're a threat."
Travis: Right. We'll be the judge of that. As you were.
Sam: Grog, keep in mind, these are our allies.
Laura: Hello!
Matt: As you walk up and you get close, you get a better view. You're expecting ominous, armored guards. Somebody possibly assigned to escort you. Instead, you're greeted by what looks to be an older couple waiting at the gate. A man and a woman, dressed in simple clothes, weathered skin. And as you go out to them, they both smile.
Sam: We hate old people. (laughter)
Laura: Who are you?
Travis: Favored enemy!
Matt: They begin walking up, and the man steps forward. You can see he's got small dirty glasses at the end of his nose and says, "Hello, hello! Good afternoon, everyone! I'm sorry to be a bother. But unless my eyes and tales do deceive me, might you all be the heroes known as Vox Machina?"
Laura: Can I insight check to see if these guys are legit?
Sam: Legit what? Old people?
Laura: It could be Lord and Lady Briarwood, for all I know!
Liam: Me too. I did well. I rolled 18 on them.
Matt: Okay. From what you can tell, they are both happy, simple folk that are here with a tension of purpose, but nothing that seems to set off any alarms.
Sam: We are Vox Machina. I'm sure word of us has spread far and wide. We're a pretty big deal. Why have you made this journey to us?
Matt: The woman, who's holding his side, lets go of his arm and says, "We come to you humbly as representatives of the farming community just north of Emon's walls."
Marisha: Oh, I love farmers!
Matt: "I am Riley Klaus and this is my husband, Ben." "Pleasure to meet y'all."
Laura: Hi.
Matt: "You see, many of us here, we make our living through livestock and small crops." Ben takes over at this point and says, "Word is that the Sovereign will be calling down troops from Fort Daxio for a while, so the need for meats and fresh produce has been elevated." The wife, Riley, then says, "Around this time, over the past two weeks, a number of our finest cows and sheep have gone missing. No struggle or mess or signs of dire wolves. Nothing! We suspected thieves, initially, but we sent up our neighbor's boy Kyle to watch over them until sunrise and he saw the culprit. From what he described, a giant bird, larger than anything he's ever seen or heard of." Ben then takes over the conversation, "Wings at least ten carts long, tip to tip. Just swooped down, he said, without sound and in one motion snatched up one of our most virile bulls. Mr. Simms, just gone like that!"
Marisha: Mr. Simms?
Matt: "That was the bull." Riley says, "Kyle said he saw it fly northwest."
Marisha: Northwest? Can I do a nature check to see if I can recognize the creature he's describing?
Liam: Are we certain he's not describing a dragon?
Marisha: 26.
Matt: 26. You've seen some big birds in your time. This is, from what they're describing, a lot bigger than any birds you've encountered in your experience. You've heard whispers of larger birds in the wild, but you've never seen anything like that. You haven't had any personal experience hearing or seeing anything of this size.
Marisha: But it is a bird?
Matt: That's what they described it as. At night.
Laura: When did these birds start showing up?
Matt: "About two weeks ago when the whole thing started to happen." And then Ben kicks in and says, "Should this keep up, most of us will lose everything before the year is out. Now, we've talked with the leaders of the farming community this side of Emon. We've scrounged up what we could." And he brings up a couple of coin purses and she goes, "512 gold pieces, 37 silver, and 103 copper. That's all we can spare."
Laura: Keep your money.
Marisha: Yes, keep your money.
Matt: "We can't possibly--"
Liam: What about this? What if you supplied us with a small stream of produce for our servants here at the keep? For cooking, for feeding them, for feeding us when we're here? It'll be a sight less than 500; it wouldn't be nothing. You could still give us something.
Matt: "Yes! We could, we'd be more than happy to!"
Sam: However, despite what my companion is saying, we are not agreeing to go after this winged beast quite yet. We hear your plight, and we sympathize, and we will do what we can, but we have very pressing matters right now. Is there a deadline of some sort? When is your next harvesting season?
Matt: "I mean, there's no deadline, but the longer that goes by, the more and more we lose by the night. Two weeks in and we've lost half of our livestock. If the creature is this big, I imagine it eats quite a bit."
Laura: And how long of a ride is it? Is it walking distance?
Matt: "To... where?"
Laura: To your farm.
Liam: To your farm.
Sam: To your farm.
Matt: "North side of Emon."
Laura: Oh, so real close!
Matt: "Yes."
Sam: We are friends of the elderly, obviously, and also of the farming community, so we are very interested in helping you. May we talk about it a bit before we decide how and when we would tackle this problem?
Matt: They look at each other and nod and he taps her hand and says, "Yes. By all means-- If you could, please help us stop this beast from ruining our livelihood."
Marisha: And can you please tell us how to get to your place. Do you normally stay there? Are you normally home?
Matt: "We wander about the community, but we do have a homestead. If you look, it's the large red wood and partially brick-based homestead closest to the city walls, on the north farm. Right outside of Emon. It's hard to miss, if you're headed that direction."
Liam: Quickly. Presently, we will find you. Guys, we were told to sit and spin basically. I mean, what's wrong with earning some brownie points in the eyes of Uriel?
Travis: Mr. and Mrs. Kraut, as friends of the elderly--
Matt: "Klaus."
Travis: Right, Kraut. Do they normally come at night, or have they ever abducted any of your sweet bulls during the day?
Matt: "We've not seen it during the day. It'd be easier for us to identify if we had. Seems to only hunt at night."
Sam: And have they ever messed with a human?
Matt: "Not that we've heard of. Not yet." He gives you this sudden look of realization and fear. And pats and comforts his wife who suddenly realizes, oh my. Are they going to take us now?
Marisha: We'll probably be by like tonight or tomorrow morning.
Liam: Yes. Tomorrow morning at the latest. We have a little bit of business. Yeah.
Marisha: So we're in the middle of doing something. We'll get to it.
Matt: "All right. Well, thank you."
Liam: I take him by the hand and say, we will see you presently.
Sam: Here. My business card.
Liam: And you can take that to the bank.
Laura: You can't actually; it's worth nothing.
Matt: "Well, thank you for listening to us ramble on, and we look forward to hearing from you in the next day."
Laura: You will.
Matt: "All right." He pats her on the arm.
Travis: Travel safe, Mr. Kraut!
Liam: Hide your bull; hide your wife.
Matt: They both wander off.
Laura: We are in danger of being ostracized. We should really be nice to everybody right now.
Sam: We were just having a conversation about how we should try to be nice from now on. But we do have very pressing matters.
Travis: Yeah, let's get fucking in there and talk to that little--
Marisha: It's funny how that type of thing can come back to bite you in the ass.
Sam: I call up to Cordell. Oi, Cordell!
Matt: "Yeah!"
Sam: Remember when I told you not to let anyone linger outside the keep?
Matt: "To be fair, the Klauses are well-known in the community."
Travis: The Krauts?
Laura: The Klauses.
Matt: "They came here for business. I figured it was probably something you'd want to hear. I apologize."
Sam: By all means, use your judgment over the orders of your master. That's fine.
Marisha: Scanlan!
Matt: Cordell bows his head sheepishly. "I apologize. I'm sorry."
Marisha: Ignore him!
Laura: We are here to help people! We're here to help.
Matt: He does his finger like this and the gates open in towards the inside of the keep wall.
Marisha: And what is wrong with you all today?!
Sam: We had a really bad dinner last night. That's all.
Laura: I head straight to the jail.
Marisha: I follow.
Matt: As you guys are doing that, Tiberius, what's the first thing you're trying to do?
Orion: Stop by and pick up the decanter from the temple.
Matt: Okay. He said it required two days. It's been less than a day since you dropped it off, just so you're aware.
Orion: Then the only thing I do is visit the keep with the sigils library or whatever.
Matt: Oh, the Lyceum? Okay.
Liam: I'm not going. I'm just going to go hang out up on the wall outside the keep.
Matt: All right. As you head to the Lyceum, the clerk lets you in. What are you specifically looking to find or research?
Orion: The sigil that's closest to the Feywild.
Matt: Okay. In researching what they have at their disposal, you understand that the Feywild itself, because it is a separate plane, the magics to traverse it are a little more difficult to do. If you notice-- and I'll confirm here just to be sure that we're on the same page-- before I go full on this here. Pardon me, just a moment while I scan through the book. The mighty book. The book of might. Yes. Sigils of teleportation require the same plane of existence, meaning you can teleport anywhere within the Prime Material Plane that you exist in. To traverse into the Feywild, you have to actually find a door into the Feywild, and then you would be able to use a sigil from the Feywild.
Orion: Then I only pick up my decanter.
Matt: Which is not ready yet.
Orion: I don't do that! Damn, I forgot! My short-term memory is just jacked!
Matt: It's all good. It's all good.
Travis: You know, somebody's been to the Feywild.
Matt: Yeah. The Feywild. What you do find is that the Feywild-- the boundaries between this realm and the Feywild tend to grow weaker at full moons. It's tied to the moon cycle. And at certain places where nature is set to run wild. A lot of druidic tribes tend to mark these locations, and in some cases actually guard them.
Laura: We know where a hole in one is. Grog went through it.
Matt: And if you recall-- good memory-- in the Frostweald, the partially frozen forest where you had that conversation with the nymph-- that portal that she existed through was specifically a door into the Feywild, which you recognized.
Orion: What city was that near?
Matt: That was south of Westruun.
Orion: Then I'll go to the thing and I'll find the Westruun sigil.
Matt: Okay. Through your research, you do find a sigil to Westruun. This is allowing you to go into this portion for this sigil because you've already used the favor that you had to get the sigil of Kraghammer.
Orion: No, I didn't. I used the amulet and we got permission to come there. I saved that favor for this.
Matt: Right, the favor for Gilmore. All I'm saying is, you've used one of two favors to get that sigil. You have to invoke Gilmore's favor to get this one. Okay. And since you're a part of the circumstance, you acquire the secondary sigil. You now know, in your memory permanently, a sigil to Westruun. You don't know where in Westruun, but you are connected there. If you choose to teleport there, you know how to. That favor has now been used by Gilmore, so you can mark that. And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a five minute rest break. So yeah, restroom, snacks, drinks and we'll be back here in about five or so minutes. We'll see you guys and continue this tense adventure. [break]
Matt: Welcome back. We've had our break; we've returned to the table. A quick note, we are 50 subscribers away from our next giveaway.
Travis: 50? Come on!
Matt: If we can get there, that'd be awesome! We'll have our giveaway-- the signed cast Critical Role photo and the cast signed art poster by Kit Buss.
Sam: Kit Buss, ladies and gentlemen!
Matt: Yeah! So you have all returned to the keep. You have found yourselves down to the basement area. You hear the distant pinging of metal, an occasional squeaking metallic noise. Like something is being altered, turned, or quenched in a water trough. Like the process of blacksmithing.
Marisha: I go to the edge of the door and knock.
Matt: As you knock on the metal door, it's like a (boom). The pinging stops. Just hangs for a second.
Marisha: Percy? It's Keyleth.
Matt: "Not right now. Please. I'm sorry. I just need to clear my head."
Marisha: Okay. We'll be here.
Matt: A moment later, you see Percy's eyes appear at the edge of the door.
Marisha: Hi!
Matt: Just looking at them, you can see they look a little sunken, a little weary.
Marisha: Did you sleep?
Matt: "Not as much as I'd like."
Marisha: Do you need anything?
Matt: His eyes look away for a second, looks back at you. "I'm all right. Thank you."
Marisha: We went and saw Uriel. Everyone in the city hates us. They think we're all criminals.
Matt: "Great. I have to get back to my work."
Marisha: Okay, yeah.
Matt: The slit shuts.
Marisha: Oh, we'll see you later, then.
Matt: You guys, however, walk down to the other side of the cell. The cell door's been closed. The keys are hanging on the nail by it. You have not used the cell until this point. It's technically pristine and unused since the construction of the keep, but the keys still hang on the key ring. On the inside of it, there is no thatch. Nothing has been put in to really make a comfortable floor. And hanging from manacles--
Laura: He's hanging?!
Sam: We're the worst.
Matt: He was put in as a prisoner.
Laura: I go and get the keys, and I take him down from the manacles.
Matt: As she rushes into the cell, begins unlocking the manacles. He's unconscious at this time. Dirt streaked on his face and spatters of dried blood from the blast of the gun.
Marisha: I go ahead and I administer Cure Wounds.
Matt: The wound at this point has been cauterized. You cast Cure Wounds as he starts to come to consciousness, in a heap on the ground. (coughs) It appears he may be healed of any damage he may still be sustaining from that, but the fingers are gone. This is beyond the magic you're capable of. He comes to consciousness on the ground, dirtied, sore. Essentially broken before you.
Laura: Does he look like he's been bitten at all?
Matt: You want to inspect?
Laura: Can I look at his neck?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Okay. You don't have a whole lot of medicinal experience, but you take a moment and inspect both sides of his neck, tilting his head side-to-side, as he's groaning and coming to. "What's going on?" Looking at the sides of his neck, there does not appear to be any sign of any puncture wounds, anything that would be reminiscent of what your brother currently is healing from.
Marisha: Can I do an insight check to see if he is also under a mind-control spell?
Matt: At the moment, no. He is barely coming to consciousness. There isn't enough of a presence at the moment to really read past.
Laura: Hey, there. Welcome back.
Matt: "Where am I?"
Laura: You are being held, at the moment, for your own safety.
Matt: "For my own safety?"
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "How?" He looks at his hand.
Laura: Well, you were captured. We're pretty sure the Briarwoods are going to be pissed as hell that you let the carriage get hit. We're just trying to protect you, really.
Marisha: Really?
Sam: I mean, his friends all died, so.
Marisha: Do we not feel like terrible people enough already?
Sam: Let's not have this conversation in front of the prisoner. What's your name, boy!
Matt: "My name is Desmond. Desmond Otham. I am the son of a messenger, a courier of the de Rolo family."
Marisha: He's the son of a messenger! That's even more ironic!
Laura: Keyleth, do you need to step outside?
Marisha: No, I'm good. Continue. Son of a messenger.
Laura: Right now, everyone is at risk. The Briarwoods are bad people, you can attest to this, yes?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: Yes. Can you tell us everything you know about them?
Matt: "It's not going to matter. They're going to find me. No one's supposed to get away."
Laura: You did!
Travis: There's always a first time.
Matt: "I don't even know where to begin." He adjusts himself, sliding back, putting his back against the wall of the cell.
Travis: I reach into the Bag of Holding. I pull out the little goblet, and I pour some ale into a cup, and I hand him a little bit of ale. No, it's fine. I take a little sip.
Matt: "Please don't take offense if I don't trust a drink from strangers who've, well, to be honest, put me in this position."
Travis: All right. I put it beside him.
Matt: "What do you want to know?"
Laura: We want to know if the Briarwoods--
Sam: Are vampires.
Laura: Pretty much. They're vampires, right? I mean, they're vampires.
Matt: "All I know from the stories I've heard. Mothers would tell their kids not to wander out at night because dark things crawl in the shadows. From what I know of vampires, they're not supposed to go out during the day, right? But I'm sure I've seen Lady Briarwood walk in the sun many a time."
Marisha: Only Lady Briarwood?
Matt: "As I recall, yes. Lord Briarwood doesn't make too many public appearances."
Sam: Have there been any strange goings-on in their residence? Sounds you've heard? People disappearing? Boxes coming in or out?
Laura: I cast Cure Wounds on him. I know Cure Wounds, bitches! Level up!
Orion: Have I reached the keep yet?
Matt: No, not yet. You're probably about an hour away, at this point. From the time you've taken to research, find this, learn the sigil to Westruun, and begin your trek back. Fortunately, you got what you wanted, but you're out of the picture for a little bit. He flinches as you put your hand up, and as you touch him, he exhales. You get to him just as he can react, briefly.
Laura: 11. Do I add anything to that?
Matt: I believe you add your Wisdom modifier to that.
Laura: 14.
Matt: He goes, "Look, my father worked for the de Rolo family before the Briarwoods came. My father vanished the night of their fall. My mother was taken in madness and lost to the night this past year. I was left alone. However, I knew the roads well between here and Whitestone and places between, growing up, traveling with my father. So I was made to be a coachman for the new nobles. I was paid, albeit little, and I was left alone. Now, when I say the new nobles, there were nobles that lived in Whitestone and worked along with the de Rolos, and they helped oversee parts of the town, the business, and the people. They had been there for many generations of their respective families, all under the de Rolos' guidance. But the night the castle fell, those nobles were dragged out. It's strange. I mean, after the brutality of that first night, it took days before the people of Whitestone knew what had happened. We saw the fires, we heard the battles, but no word of the victors until three days had passed. We were too scared to approach. By then, the Briarwoods called a town meeting. They explained their new rule over the town. A number objected, which is expected. Many strong-willed folk in Whitestone, those days. They were subsequently shot down at arrow-point. The rest were quiet. They then dragged out the noble families and executed them, gifting their property and titles to the various cut-throats and mercenaries they had hired, brought across the channel to help them take the town. They're not just two people; they've used a lot of money and influence from wherever they came from and brought a whole slew of very dastardly folk, who have since been given the titles once held by the other nobles of Whitestone, living in their homes, taking their tithes and most of the profits made from the businesses they've forced us to continue to run from within the city. A number of families fled into the woods the night after the executions, using the shadows of a moonless evening to keep safe. They were all found hanging from the Sun Tree the next morning. They kept things going as they were, mostly: farming, logging, manning the white marble mines. Business went as usual, all filling the pockets of the new nobles and the Briarwoods. We were given food, kept our immediate property. As long as we didn't attempt to leave, we were promised safety. That lasted for a few years, until the nobles grew bored. Twitchy. They began to abuse the people of Whitestone: scare us for fun, brand, cut, steal the children, leave them back, destroyed. They treat us like animals. Folks went missing. I was beaten so bad by my employer, Count Tylieri. But Lord Briarwood noticed, one night he was passing through the city. He saw wounds on my back when he was meeting with Count Tylieri. When he asked me in private how I got them, I couldn't lie. Couldn't resist him. He has a way of drawing the truth out of you. Now, he told me this unrefined violence was boorish to him and his wife. That was the last I ever saw of Lord Tylieri. Lord and Lady Briarwood took me in as their own driver and showed me Tylieri hanging from that same Sun Tree the next morning. I was thankful, then. In a strange way, life had been so terrible for so long, it was the first time I saw someone reach out and save me. They took me in as their driver after that. It was a better thing to be away from the anger and the fists of the thugs. But the more I got to know the Briarwoods, the more nightmarish I realized they were. Behind the walls of that castle was no longer a grand fortress that we heard it was. Seeing it, keeping watch and guard over our people. No, that was a domain of perverse magics and sacrilege, it was. The green fog drifting out from the ground where it stood. The same servants still run the halls, but they aren't living. They're walking vessels of undeath, their flesh slowly tearing away. The garden in back lies shriveled, a foul green mist forever pouring out. They're excavating something in the dungeon, plundering pieces. A lot of their attention seems to be down there; I don't know why. I dare not wander too far down. They bring up old things. Ancient things. Relics, books, bones. You live in that world long enough, you believe there is no way out. Death would be easy, though I've seen that death is no real end there. It's just the beginning of a whole new terrible existence. A far worse fate."
Laura: If we keep you here, protected, would you be willing to tell your story to someone else?
Matt: "Who would you want me to tell it to?"
Laura: The emperor. The guards here. An army that could go and fight the Briarwoods.
Matt: "Maybe."
Marisha: This could be an option to save Whitestone, and you would have your freedom.
Matt: "I don't know. You don't know what it's like. You don't know what they've done. They're going to find me."
Sam: We can protect you. We are safe here in this keep, and you're surrounded by very powerful allies now.
Travis: We've stood before them, and we did not fall.
Laura: It's true.
Matt: "I'll think about it."
Marisha: Would you like to stay in the guest room upstairs? You'd be more comfortable. You could get a good night's rest.
Laura: Far more comfortable. A little less safe. I'm going to put it out there.
Matt: That resonates with him immediately, and his eyes flash open. "I mean no disrespect, but if this is safe, then I'd rather stay here."
Laura: I think it is. And we will bring a bed down to you, make sure you're comfortable. I don't want you sleeping on the floor. That's terrible.
Matt: "You're all being very accommodating."
Travis: You'll get every consideration for protection. We value your info very much.
Marisha: You're also the key to our own freedom, so it's important.
Sam: You also caught us on a day where we're trying to be nicer to people. (laughter)
Sam: Lucky for you.
Liam: Just be glad you're not an old woman.
Matt: "I'll stay here for now."
Laura: All right.
Matt: "I need to think on it. I've been promised such protection before."
Sam: From the Briarwoods?
Matt: "From a few. And they're dead. An enemy of an enemy doesn't necessarily make them a friend, I've discovered."
Marisha: No, but it can make them allies if they have mutual enemies. Of their enemies. It's a little complicated.
Matt: This whole conversation, the emotional recalling of everything, you can see has been very taxing on him and his still mostly conscious state. He looks exhausted, scared, and still trying to suss out all the information coming at him right now.
Marisha: Grog, why don't you carry the bed down from upstairs?
Travis: Not a problem. Keep the goblet nearby. It is very nice ale.
Marisha: Would you like something to eat?
Matt: "Yes, please."
Marisha: We'll have our staff bring down some food.
Matt: He takes the goblet. He looks at it, smells it, but still holds it at bay as you walk off. You eventually go-- easy enough for you-- take the bed. You have to turn it to the side to take it out, which causes all of the cushions to fall out.
Travis: Aw, shit. (laughter)
Travis: I grab a little pillow with my toes, and I hobble down.
Matt: It takes about 20 minutes and three trips, but you manage to get the bed down there from the guest room.
Travis: Not a problem.
Matt: When you fit it in the cell-- and it's not a large cell; it's maybe ten by ten feet maximum. You place it there. As you guys walk back, you notice as you see Grog walking back down the stairway-- right around the corner as you go down the steps, the hallway goes to the cell, and it turns to the right and to the left to the workshop. You see around the corner a shoulder, listening in. There's a person. And you recognize that it is Percy. Percy has stepped out of the workshop and apparently has been hearing everything this entire time.
Laura: Are you all right?
Matt: "I'm fine." And Percy immediately steps away and you hear the door close with a slam.
Laura: Give him time.
Sam: So moody!
Laura: So yeah, I'm going to lock it. I'm just going to lock your door. To make sure you're safe, make sure nobody can get in.
Matt: "Keep him away from me. Who is that?"
Sam: He's a friend. I know it doesn't seem like it from the condition of your paw, but he's a friend. He's in the same boat as you, trying to stay safe from danger.
Laura: The Briarwoods destroyed his family, as well.
Matt: And you see now, there's like this look of tension on his face that's mixed with tired. And eventually finding the bed and takes the goblet-- still filled, has not drunk from it-- just slips it next to the side of the bed. Eventually food is brought down.
Laura: And a chamber pot, because come on!
Matt: All the basic pleasantries are brought within the cell. He lies on the bed and takes the plate up with him and starts just scarfing some of the bread rolls down. And immediately starts going for the mashed potatoes. You can see a decent meal hasn't been had in quite a while. Especially the journey, what is essentially a seven to eight day journey from Whitestone, probably has not been very kind to him. Eats and then promptly passes out on the bed. Food still mashed on the side of the face. Just goes straight into a slumber.
Travis: Is there any other entrance to the cell area besides the door? No barred windows or anything like that?
Matt: No. It's underground. It's all solid, solid stone walls. And there is the barred front door, and then just goes right into the hallway that goes up the stairs to your left and across the way and around the corner to the workshop.
Travis: You can't cast any kind of alarm system? A trigger?
Laura: So that Percy can't get anything through there?
Marisha: Let me reference my spell tome. It's not a common one. It's situational. But let me check real quick. I haven't read that chapter from my book in a while.
Orion: Is Allura on the way back from the Lyceum?
Matt: No, the Lyceum is in the Erudite District. Allura's tower is in the Cloudtop, which is the central part of Emon.
Laura: I do want to go check out that bird creature at the farmhouse tonight.
Sam: Yes. Well, have we stationed a guard down there?
Travis: We should. We have five or six.
Sam: All right. I'll go talk to Cordell. That's his name, right?
Travis: No, not Cordell. Let's get somebody else.
Laura: Get the crossbow guy that we like so much. The guy that's the captain of the guards.
Sam: Is that Kendrick? Or Shayne? Oh, the girl?
Laura: No, the guy. He's awesome and he's an archer, as well.
Sam: Jarett?
Laura: Jarett. That's it!
Sam: All right, we'll get Jarett. Oh, Jarett?
Matt: You make your way to the back part of the wall, and there is a small tower that's constructed as part of the back wall. That's where Jarett usually keeps watch. Jarett has the in-between shift between the guards, so he can be present for both sides and keep a watch during the afternoon until the nighttime. Probably till about midnight or so. So as you make your way out of the keep, Tiberius, are you heading back to the keep or are you heading toward the Cloudtop District? This will dictate whether or not you show up around this time.
Orion: I'm going to Allura's.
Laura: I'm staying down in the prison, just for the time being. I don't want to leave him alone with Percy.
Matt: You go to find Jarett, who's up at the top of the tower. And as you call to him, Jarett leans over. And you see him, you know, short jet-black hair, darker complexion. Very handsome, younger, early-twenties guy. Well-dressed over his studded leather armor that he wears underneath and has the crossbow on the side. He leans over. "Scanlan, it has been some time. It is so good to hear from you. What can I be of service for?"
Sam: We need you to watch a prisoner for us, downstairs in our jail cell, which we had built and are now using. You'll be guarding the prisoner to make sure he doesn't escape, but also making sure he stays safe. He possesses information that's very valuable to us. And one of the people who hires you might try to kill him, so if Percy tries to go in there, can you stop him without hurting either party?
Matt: "I imagine this would be very well-suited for my skill set. It will be strange to keep watch against one of my employers, but he's been a bit sheepish around me anyway."
Sam: You think you could take Percy?
Matt: "Well, I think I can at least talk some sense into him!"
Travis: I like him!
Sam: Wow! Jarett, you're ballsy! Just out of curiosity, if he was running at you, what would you do? (laughter)
Matt: "Well, first and foremost, I would dive in the forward motion, leg out, to put him off balance. This would be from a frontal melee-- you're messing with me, aren't you?"
Sam: A little bit!
Matt: "Ah, gnomes! Very well."
Sam: Do you need anything to help?
Matt: "I have access to my own private armory, and I have utmost faith."
Sam: All right. Well, keep him safe and there's an extra five gold in it for you?
Laura: Oh! Pathetic!
Sam: I don't know! Ten! Ten gold!
Matt: "Gnomes."
Sam: I don't know how money works. We'll talk to Vex about it.
Matt: "Certainly. All right. I will do this." And he stands up, and goes and starts gathering his general setup supplies inside the guard tower. As you walk back to the keep, you hear him whistle and start calling out to Shayne to go ahead and take over, up in the tower.
Liam: I wasn't there for any of that. I was upstairs on the roof, just thinking.
Matt: Tiberius, you make your way into the Cloudtop District. As you come to the front gates of the district, the guards that normally recognize you and welcome you in, recognize you and stand firm, weapons at the ready.
Orion: At Allura's tower?
Matt: At the Cloudtop District entirely. You guys had to get written permission to enter there when you first came to Emon, anyway, since that's where the nobility and many of the important figures of Emon reside. It appears that since you've been taken out of the Council and you're under investigation, your access to such a sensitive location within Emon has been temporarily revoked, and the guards are not letting you through.
Orion: Is that it? So I just turn around? Go back?
Matt: It's up to you. The guards are just there, standing.
Orion: Greeting and salutations. I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia. Moreover, a member of Vox Machina, over at Greyskull Keep. It seems that you all are posturing and whatnot. (chuckles) It's adorable. But I'm here to see Lady Allura. Could you let her know that I would like to speak to her, or get out of my way so I can just go over there and tell her myself?
Matt: "We have direct orders to not let you or any other member of Vox Machina into the Cloudtop District until your investigation is complete. So no, and no."
Orion: Well, do the second thing. If you don't do one thing, do one of the other things.
Matt: "Your information and wish has been processed, taken into consideration. Thank you very much. Please be on your way."
Orion: Oh, it has been, it has been processed! Oh, that's good to know! I appreciate that. Very well. I cast Fly on myself and I go back to the keep.
Matt: Okay. (whoosh) They both did not expect that exit. You essentially Superman-ed. You're just like (thud). Little cloud of smoke in the shape of a dragonborn left behind. All right. So as you cruise over, you see in the distance, from where you're standing at the top of the keep, you see a distant bead of dark shadow that approaches and grows larger, and it is an air-cruising Tiberius making his way towards the keep.
Liam: I hide behind-- I don't want to get hit, so I'm going to crouch down a little bit, carefully behind one of the pieces of wall. Yeah. Rough landings, sometimes.
Orion: I fly in. Vox Machina!
Liam: Easy. Be careful.
Orion: Sorry. Hi. What are you doing? Are you up here thinking?
Liam: Why, I suppose I was. The others are downstairs interrogating that boy. Where have you been?
Orion: Off doing things that wasn't really that productive, overall, but they don't like me anywhere, especially now.
Liam: Do you want to have a drink?
Orion: Yes, actually, I do.
Liam: I've got a flask. You normally drink water. You want a shot, though?
Orion: Yes, I would love some alcohol. This calls for alcohol.
Liam: I pull out my flask, and I'm amazed, because I've never seen this and I hand it over to him.
Orion: Oh yes. (whoosh)
Sam: Did you eat the flask?
Orion: No, fire breath.
Liam: Do you want to pass that bad boy back? Is it hot?
Matt: It's empty.
Liam: Oh, it's empty! Well, I guess that was worth it.
Orion: (slurred) What? What are you talking about? Don't you tell me how to drink. Oh, you!
Travis: I come out from the castle into the courtyard, and I go, hey! I feel like chicken tonight! Can we go hunt this big bird?
Liam: Tiberius-- I just got him drunk!
Travis: Really?
Orion: (slurred) He gave me a shot of his flask water, and it's so good.
Travis: Are you sure you didn't hit him with the blunt side of your knife again?
Liam: No, no, he took a shot of the old firewater, and I don't know. We might want to slap him a bit--
Orion: (slurred) Allura doesn't like me anymore because I killed that bitch who tried to kill us, and now she's fucking-- nobody likes us!
Liam: Let's find Keyleth.
Travis: Yeah. Smart. Keyleth!
Marisha: What? I was reading. What?
Travis: Tibs got turnt up. Will you fix it?
Marisha: How?
Orion: Vax gave me--
Marisha: What did you do? Why are you touching me?
Orion: Oh, I love protecting you, it is-- and Lockheed is, he loves you, too--
Marisha: Don't touch me right now!
Orion: See, I'm telling you, nobody likes me.
Liam: I gave him his first drinky. I'm sorry. Do you think you could pull him out of it?
Marisha: What?
Liam: I thought he was going to say no! He didn't leave me any.
Orion: It's good. Hi. How are you? I'm Tiberius-- Draconia. You are princess pretty face. He likes you, too.
Liam: Vax walks away, off the roof. Out of here. I'm gone!
Travis: Grog is riveted.
Orion: Human kissy mouth, with you is-- (vomits) (laughter)
Orion: I'm good.
Marisha: If you touch me one more time!
Orion: Oh! Sorry. Did you need to go somewhere?
Marisha: I am doing something else, a request that was already made previously, before "can we fix drunk Tiberius," so I'm a little busy! Why don't you go sleep it off, take a nap, and I will deal with you in a second.
Orion: Is it sleepy time?
Marisha: For you.
Orion: Should I cast Fireball?
Marisha: Oh my god. And I shove him into the cell and put him in bed--
Travis: No, we're not in the prison. We're out in the courtyard.
Marisha: Oh, I thought that you said-- everyone was like, Keyleth!
Laura: I'm still in the prison. Everybody else is out of the prison.
Matt: So where do you push him?
Orion: She pushed me off the roof.
Marisha: No! I thought we were downstairs.
Orion: I fall off the roof. I still have Fly on myself, don't I?
Marisha: You don't fall off the roof. I don't know what I do with him. I let him pass out.
Orion: I'm going to get a sandwich.
Marisha: I let him go get a sandwich.
Sam: I encourage sandwich! (laughter)
Matt: That's the quote of the night. Encouraged to get a sandwich, Tiberius wanders off. What are you doing to prepare what you were doing?
Marisha: I don't know! I got distracted!
Orion: I'm not there.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Well, as the day progresses, what would you guys like to do?
Marisha: Wait. My idea. Okay. We were wanting extra fortification? We were wanting extra protection. Okay? I can't necessarily cast a big spell. I could cast Hallucinatory Terrain. We have a few options; I'm giving them to you all. I can cast Hallucinatory Terrain to make this look like something else. I don't think-- I don't know. I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know. I could conjure a few woodland beings for, like, extra bears. We could have some bears guarding the palace. I could also throw up a Wall of Thorns, to barrier the cell with the wall of thorns. You're not here?
Sam: I think everyone left. I think it's just you and me up here, and drunk Tiberius.
Marisha: I went downstairs, and I'm saying this to the group so I don't have to repeat myself!
Orion: Oh, so then I turn around with my sandwich and am like, we have to just make Allura talk to us. She can fix everything.
Travis: I grab Tiberius's mouth and I cover it. Please continue.
Sam: Wall of Thorns could be good.
Laura: I like Wall of Thorns.
Marisha: The thing with Wall of Thorns is it's not super big. It's 60 feet.
Sam: That's pretty big!
Laura: Oh. That's not the whole place, though.
Sam: Oh, 60 feet long. I thought you meant high.
Marisha: No, it's 100 feet high. It's really high. Actually, I don't know how high it is. Don't quote me on that. But it's not that long, but we could fortify the doors more. Have bears. We could do multiple things, too.
Liam: I think that the Hallucinatory Terrain wouldn't work. I felt like they could see right through me.
Travis: I think so, too.
Marisha: On the Briarwoods?
Laura: Yeah, they can see through illusions pretty darn well.
Sam: Listen, Percy's here. He can defend for us.
Orion: No, you need a warding spell.
Sam: Why don't we just leave someone behind?
Marisha: Percy's behind.
Travis: Percy's here and so are five? Six? How many employees do we have?
Laura: Our very capable guards.
Travis: Why don't you make some extra bears that don't hate us?
Marisha: Huh?
Travis: Why don't you make some extra bears that don't hate us?
Marisha: All right, I'll make some extra bears.
Orion: Put some little hats on them and make them cute.
Liam: Do you think you could fix him? Because he's a lot of firepower if we're going to go--
Marisha: What gets rid of drunkenness? (laughs)
Laura: Maybe Restoration?
Matt: Restoration would probably take care of it.
Marisha: I don't want to burn a Restoration spell on your drunkenness.
Laura: Can you cast little Restoration?
Matt: You could also just give it a couple of hours. Drink a lot of water.
Travis: What time is it?
Matt: At this point, it's probably close to 3 00 in the afternoon.
Travis: So it's 3 00 in the afternoon. The bird doesn't even come until night. We could let him wear it off.
Marisha: What time is it?
Sam: 3 00. We just established this. We're going to wait until night and go.
Laura: She said she hated you. How did that feel?
Liam: Fine. That was fine. That was the heat of the moment. She was angry. We're a team.
Matt: All right. What's the plan, guys?
Sam: The plan is we're going to let him sober up. We're going to give him some coffee. And then we're going to set off for the north farmlands at dusk.
Orion: Oh, we should get some corn and other harvestments at the farms.
Marisha: I make an army of bears.
Matt: Okay. This concentration will last an hour.
Laura: Oh! That's it.
Matt: The Conjure Woodland Beings?
Marisha: Wait! No! Hang on. What if I conjure a bear, and then-- let me make sure, while they figure their stuff out. See, we're all figuring stuff out?
Laura: What if I leave Trinket in the prison with Jarett?
Travis: Yeah! That won't freak him out at all.
Sam: Well, with Cordell. Jarett's down in the cell. This is defense against invading vampires.
Marisha: Okay! I have a better idea!
Travis: Yep?
Sam: Oh my god.
Marisha: Why don't I conjure an elemental, and then I can cast Planar Binding on him and he'll hang out for 24 hours.
Sam: Great! Do it. Make it done. Let's go kill a bird.
Travis: Lead with that next time.
Marisha: I was figuring it out. It's new.
Sam: You've got to talk it through.
Marisha: Figuring it out.
Travis: That's awesome!
Matt: Yep! That'll do.
Travis: Don't vampires hate fire? Can you do fire?
Laura: Yeah, fire! Fire elemental!
Liam: Running water.
Laura: Ooh, water elemental! (gasps) Tiberius, remember that you--
Travis: He's drunk!
Laura: I know.
Sam: Don't talk to him.
Travis: He won't remember anything.
Orion: (slurred) I love how you shoot arrows at things' eyeballs.
Sam: I use Minor Illusion to create Lockheed, and I have him scamper away.
Orion: Oh, that's you. But where are you going? You go play up there. Tell your brother to be good. Anyway, you're so pretty.
Matt: So are you doing that, Marisha? Keyleth, are you summoning an elemental?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay. Which kind?
Marisha: Water elemental.
Matt: Okay. And you cast Planar Binding. Part of the material component cost is a gem that's worth at least 1,000 gold pieces.
Travis: I have one of those.
Laura: You do?
Travis: Yeah. It's a jewel that's red and palm-sized.
Laura: I have a diamond of awesome. And a regular diamond, as well.
Liam: If I create a trap here, can you bind some magic to it?
Orion: You can do anything with magic. You can make things go. You can make things stop.
Travis: I cover Tiberius's mouth again.
Laura: I give her a diamond.
Matt: All right. Is this the awesome diamond or the regular diamond?
Laura: This is a regular diamond. The awesome diamond is special.
Matt: All right.
Laura: No! Don't do that!
Marisha: I know! Why do you do that?
Laura: Diamonds are really expensive! Any diamonds!
Marisha: I know! And an awesome diamond has got to be more than 1,000, so this time there's got to be at least 1,000. Grog, what kind of jewel do you have?
Travis: It's a palm-sized ruby.
Marisha: A palm-sized ruby?
Travis: Yeah, I got a big palm!
Marisha: Tiberius.
Sam: No, just don't.
Matt: Vex. Your keen eye is able to ascertain that the palm-sized ruby is worth roughly 1,200 gold pieces and would be suitable for this ritual.
Laura: I think we should use the ruby. Because I have an eye for these things.
Travis: Do we think they're going to come while we do this? Do we want to waste it? Because that's an awesome outside defense. Do we want to waste it for this? What if they're coming? Does it cost one jewel per--
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Maybe we should save that, because that's awesome!
Liam: Is there a possibility, DM, that I could-- if he's sobered up-- if I set a trap, that a spell of his could be bound to it, somehow, and go off? I have no idea.
Matt: It's hard to say. There are certain spells that can enable that. That can take certain spells that trigger at a certain time. Nothing that's particularly in your guys' realm of experience or understanding though, unfortunately.
Liam: All right. So I can look into it for the future, but not today.
Travis: Keyleth, I like that. I think we should keep it in case there is an actual attack coming. Because it might just, 24 hours and then we waste it. Nobody came.
Marisha: That's true. To be fair, the castle's being heavily watched by outsiders, as well.
Sam: Okay! Listen. Let's just go.
Orion: Grog is big. Scanlan's small. Everything is great. Hi.
Liam: Can we leave Trinket? To watch.
Laura: What? He's going to go down in the prison with Jarett.
Matt: Okay. You bring Trinket down. Trinket stands watch right in the center, plops down right up against the bars.
Laura: I knock on Percy's door and say, Percy?
Matt: "Yes?"
Laura: Trinket's out here. If you need anything, you just come out and you pet him.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: Welcome.
Orion: I also go up to the door and go, Trinket. (mumbling) Percy.
Laura: Aren't you sober yet?
Orion: No, it's been like five minutes, hasn't it?
Matt: Yeah. Over time, over the next two to three hours or so, you guys have set up a place to go. They have given you some water, and you've managed to sober up a bit.
Liam: I actually picked his pocket and took his bottle of endless water. Don't you have a bottle of water like that?
Matt: No. That is currently left to be blessed for holy water.
Liam: Oh. Oh, well.
Travis: And we take the scenic route to let him walk it off as we head up towards Big Bird's house.
Sam: Great!
Matt: All right. So. You guys make your way around the outskirts of Emon under moonlight. It's a three-quarter waxing moon. You make your way to the farm vicinity on the north side of the city. It doesn't take long for you to eventually suss out the house that matches the description that you were given by the Klauses. You knock on the door, and they eagerly greet your arrival and invite you in. "So glad you all could make it. Have you decided? Have you given our community's request some thought?"
Sam: We're here to help. We're the heroes that you asked for.
Travis: We love old people.
Matt: "Thank you. That's really good of you. We will happily provide you with fresh produce, going forward. We've talked to a few of the members of the community and we're going to make sure that's taken care of."
Sam: Where do you think we should stake out this bird? Where are your livestock kept?
Matt: "The livestock are kept on the eastern side of this community. If you look about, say about half a mile out to where the actual residences stop being clustered together, you'll see there are a number of large livestock containment areas. Hard to miss out there. We have pens for sheep; we have pens for cows; we have pens for horses, other beasts of burden. That whole vicinity is where most of these attacks seem to be coming. So that's probably your best bet there."
Liam: And the biggest you have are the bulls, you said?
Matt: "Bulls. We have a few big cows, as well. We've lost a few of them, unfortunately."
Travis: That'll be all we need.
Laura: Can one of us polymorph into a giant cow?
Sam: Sure.
Marisha: I could also talk to cows again. Maybe these cows will know something.
Travis: We head out to the pasture.
Marisha: First can I ask her, you said your neighbor boy, Kyle?
Sam: Kyle. The neighbor boy. The neighbor boy's son. Yes.
Matt: "That's true. Kyle's the one who originally spotted it, yeah."
Marisha: Where does he live?
Matt: "He's actually the son of the man who runs most of the livestock areas over there. You can go and head over there. He's probably still up, keeping his eye out in case it comes back."
Marisha: Thank you. I go to Kyle.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way over there. It's easy to find. There's large pens. You can see that for as big as the pens are built and their structure, they are noticeably dwindled. You can see why there's been some worry in the community here. The fact that it's only been two weeks and this many creatures are gone is a little disconcerting. As you get there, you can see the house has its light on. There are glowing windows. And sitting in a chair, holding a crossbow across his lap, you see a 19-year-old boy, rugged chin growth, dirty red hair that's disheveled. And he's sitting there looking around in the sky. Rocking back and forth in his chair as you approach. "Who goes there?"
Sam: Don't worry, we're friends. We're friends of the Klauses. Mr. and Mrs. Klaus.
Matt: "Okay. Okay. So you the ones they say was coming to help?"
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: Aye.
Laura: We hear you have a keen eye, Kyle.
Matt: "I've seen some things, yeah."
Sam: Where have they been attacking lately?
Matt: Points to the whole area in front of him and says, "Are you keeping watch now? Great. Thank you."
Marisha: No! Wait! Don't leave yet. We need you.
Orion: Yes, yes. Keyleth. We are Vox Machina. Over from Greyskull Keep. I'm Tiberius Stormwind.
Marisha: That's irrelevant. The point is, I was wondering if you had any more information about the creature.
Matt: "I mean, other than the fact that it was just a really big bird. Really big. Huge."
Marisha: Do you remember any other details? Any other defining details other than "bird?"
Matt: "It's hard to see in the moonlight."
Sam: When it picks up a cow or whatever it's been picking up, does it strike with the beak or the claws? The talons.
Matt: "Claws, and sometimes it takes two at a time, one in each claw, and just carries them away. "
Orion: Have you seen any of its droppings anywhere?
Matt: "No. "
Travis: Have you managed to hit it with your crossbow?
Matt: "I've missed."
Liam: And you're certain this is a feathered beast, or no?
Matt: "Best I can see. It's dark out here at that time of night and it looks like a bird. It doesn't make any noise and swoops on down and takes them away and flies off in that direction."
Travis: I've heard that those giant birds are attracted to red-headed, 19-year-old, scruffy-chin folk with crossbows.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Travis: Awesome.
Matt: This would be with your charisma.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Nice. He goes, "Well, I don't want to be here, then. You guys can keep an eye out. I've got to go." And unloads the bolt in the crossbow, slings it up under his arm--
Sam: Wait! Before you leave. I'm sorry. I have an itch. And it can only be scratched with a cowbell. Do you have a cowbell anywhere around here? I just need a cowbell. Can I borrow a cowbell from you?
Matt: "Your kid's weird." And he keeps walking.
Marisha: Your kid is weird!
Sam: I'm not a child!
Laura: Do I see any cowbells on the ground?
Matt: You can take a glance about. You eventually can see that there is set up on one of the fences that fences in the cows, there is a cowbell, yes.
Laura: Hey, there's a cowbell, Scanlan.
Sam: Great. It will help the ruse. Here's my plan we're all cows. Is that an okay plan?
Laura: I like it!
Marisha: I'm into this plan. But doesn't that essentially make us the bait?
Sam: Yes, we're our own bait. Are you cool with that?
Laura: Should one of us maybe not be a cow?
Marisha: Well, here's the thing, maybe a few of us should not be cows because only a few people are going to have the ability to turn out of being a cow once they are a cow, unless they take damage.
Travis: We went from all cows to pretty much no one is a cow.
Laura: No, Keyleth is definitely a cow. No, I mean-- I didn't-- we didn't mean like that. You're very lovely.
Marisha: It's okay. What Vax said was way worse, earlier.
Travis: How do you come out of being a cow, if you are one?
Sam: I can get rid of it.
Travis: You would do it? Let's do it! When else are we all going to be cows? Come on! Unless it kills them instantly, we'll be fine.
Orion: I'm fine. I go invisible.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I'm going to lay in wait with an arrow. All the rest of you can be cows.
Liam: I think I'm better served waiting to strike.
Sam: You and me, Grog. We're cows!
Liam: If it grabs one of them, I'll deal more damage. If it grabs me, I'll deal no damage. But if it grabs Scanlan cow, I can--
Marisha: Another thing is, I can turn into a cow. I can turn someone else into a cow. Well, Polymorph is a concentration spell.
Sam: I can turn us all into cows.
Marisha: Oh. Because you got that thing.
Travis: Cow or no, Keyleth? Give us your answer.
Marisha: Oh, I'm a cow.
Sam: Seeming.
Orion: Oh, we are not actually cows?
Sam: We'll just seem like cows.
Marisha: Except for me who is going to be an actual cow.
Orion: If it's Polymorph, I couldn't cast stuff. I redact my Invisibility and I'll be a cow. I'm also going to be a cow. I want to be a brown cow.
Marisha: We're all cows! Just embrace it.
Matt: You can't change a target's body type.
Sam: What? No.
Matt: So the same form of your limbs-- you're right.
Sam: You can't change size, but we can all be Grog-sized cows or Scanlan-sized cows.
Matt: It's going to be an array of very strangely sized cows.
Marisha: Scanlan would be like a calf. Big calf.
Sam: What do you think?
Matt: I'll allow it! (cheering and laughter)
Sam: I'll allow it! (cheering and laughter)
Sam: Gather close to me!
Travis: We want to get in the pen first, right?
Sam: Yes, let's go into the pen, and if I may, I'm going to wear the cow bell.
Travis: Sure! You've earned it. (laughter)
Laura: How you going to put it? I'm just going to put it around your neck right now.
Travis: Super loose.
Matt: You guys make your way into the cow pen. The little bit of moonlight that's coming down from the sky illuminates. You see the cows are clustered underneath this overhang that is used for temporary shelter. You hear this distant (mooing) as you approach and make noise. No one's not too upset yet. It's more low muttering.
Travis: What if that was attraction?
Matt: Not yet.
Marisha: If we use Seeming, we just appear to be cows, but we can still speak, right?
Matt: Yeah. Anything sees you as cows--
Marisha: Would be like, holy shit, those are talking cows!
Sam: It's "cow-moo-flage." (groaning)
Sam: Thank you.
Orion: That's good.
Matt: I have to give you experience for that. (laughter)
Liam: Wait. What's going on? Are we turning into cows?
Sam: We just will seem like cows.
Liam: I don't understand magic.
Travis: Just go along. Go along.
Laura: That way we can ambush the bird.
Marisha: We are going to look like cows. Are we going to look like cows to each other, too?
Matt: You'll find out.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: As you all gather around the small gnome, currently adorned with the cowbell around his neck.
Liam: Just like the brothels, eh?
Matt: You complete the spell and with a sudden (whoosh) of cold night air, your vision blurs and you blink for a second. You look around and Vox Machina is now, instead, an array of slightly smaller than average cows. (mooing)
Sam: (barks) Oh, wait. No.
Matt: You're, by the way, more of a calf.
Laura: You are so cute, Scanlan.
Marisha: Okay, shall we go interview some cows?
Laura: Let's go talk to some cows. I want to walk over to the cows with you.
Matt: You guys step up, awkwardly, towards the cows, some of which are sleeping, some of which are noticing and sitting there just chewing.
Marisha: Which one looks like the alpha male?
Laura: The one that's got horns.
Matt: There are no males in this pen, because they are cows.
Orion: I try to speak to the cow.
Matt: Okay. What do you say?
Orion: Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
Matt: You speak Common. You don't know Cow.
Marisha: Tiberius, just because you look like a cow doesn't mean you can talk to the cows. The cows don't understand English. No matter if you look like a cow, they still don't understand Common.
Liam: Boy, if Uriel could see us now. (laughter)
Travis: We are "cow-nsel" worthy.
Marisha: I cast Speak With Animals.
Matt: This is the best Vox Machina adventure ever! All right, you cast Speak With Animals.
Marisha: Yes. Actually, how many animals can I hit with Speak with Animals? It is called Animals, right? Or is it just Speak with Animal?
Matt: I think it affects you. I think it gives you the ability to speak with.
Marisha: Oh, just me the ability?
Orion: You're Dr. Doolittle.
Marisha: Oh, yeah. I think you're right. Okay, so I cast Speak With Animals on myself.
Matt: All right. Yep! On self for ten minutes.
Orion: Make sure the cow-- What? She may know a cow that is over there.
Marisha: Okay, so I go up. Is there a cluster of nice-looking ladies, sitting around?
Matt: All the cows are clustered in this one corner, up against each other for body warmth. And there are few that are just like (moo).
Marisha: Hello, ladies. Good evening.
Matt: (moo) Which is what you guys hear. You hear as a response: "What are you doing? We're trying to sleep."
Marisha: I do apologize to awaken you. I was just curious if you could tell me a little bit about some of the events that have been transpiring around here lately? Mainly, the results of your kind getting killed?
Matt: "My kind?"
Orion: Just ask about the bird!
Marisha: Have you seen a giant bird flying around? Anyone?
Matt: At which point, all the cows start shuddering and say, "Yes. Haven't you? It keeps taking us. Why do you think we're hiding under this?"
Marisha: Oh, sure.
Matt: "Be careful. If you stay out there, it'll see you."
Marisha: Right. Where, exactly? Where have they been-- okay. Damn, cows! It's never--
Sam: Keyleth, what vital information have you learned?
Marisha: I'll get back to you in one second. Can you tell me anything about what it looks like?
Matt: "It's big and has wings. It's fast, and it keeps taking us."
Orion: Ask her where the moon is at night--
Marisha: Does it seem to come at a certain time of the night?
Matt: "The dark time."
Orion: It's a cow. This is the same as before.
Travis: Because nothing is happening I am now trying to eat grass.
Matt: You bend down, and take clusters with your hand, and start eating grass.
Orion: Oh, we are ourselves, still?
Matt: Yeah, you are not actually physically cows. You are still yourselves. You just look like cows.
Sam: I, for once, and it's not weird, I just shit on the floor. (laughter)
Sam: Seems totally normal.
Travis: We are in it, baby!
Laura: I'm just going to notch a bow to my bow, just to keep a lookout to the sky.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Can I Prestidigitate smells?
Matt: You could.
Orion: Sweet. Go ahead. (laughter)
Sam: All right, so we go out into the field.
Marisha: They're cows. I forgot that talking to cows never goes well.
Laura: Yeah, remember Dork?
Marisha: Didn't seem to know a lot. They're simple-minded beasts.
Laura: Dork the ox.
Marisha: Yeah, poor Dork. Dork the ox.
Matt: Rest in peace, Dork.
Travis: Pour a little out.
Matt: You guys make your way. You wait a while, a good two-hour period, as cows, before eventually you, keeping your eye to the sky with your arrow nocked, see a whisk of shadow across the moonlight.
Laura: (whistles)
Travis: What was that?
Laura: I'm letting you guys fucking know there's a thing in the sky.
Orion: Is it Jumanji time?
Sam: Not quite.
Matt: At this point, you guys look up, and you see something circle once. It looks like a bird. It's just not as big as you were expecting. Looks like a bigger hawk.
Orion: I cast Stoneskin on myself.
Matt: Okay. Bigger and bigger
Liam: My cow is going stealth.
Matt: Roll for cow stealth! (laughter)
Liam: 23.
Matt: Okay. You're still a cow.
Marisha: I make myself look available. I step away from the rest of the herd a little bit.
Travis: I go into a cow rage and start chewing faster.
Matt: You would like to chew! All right.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark it.
Matt: Okay. Well, it has to come within range first.
Laura: As soon as it is.
Matt: As it swoops down, you see this bird just gets larger and larger and you realize it was quite a distance away. And now that it's getting closer, the tales you've heard are true. This is at least a 100-foot wing span, if not more.
Orion: I'm going to fix my ring on it.
Marisha: 100-foot wing span?
Orion: As it gets close I'm going to brace my ring as it's coming towards us.
Matt: Okay. It comes. It dives down with extreme speed and goes into a dive. It comes into range. You cast Hunter's Mark on it. You have your ring ready. What you doing?
Orion: Cast Slow on it!
Matt: Cast Slow? All righty. What is the DC on that?
Orion: 17.
Matt: And what is the save?
Sam: Is it wisdom or charisma or something?
Orion: It's concentration! No, wait, it is a concentration.
Matt: Yes it is. That's okay. I'm finding it. All right, it is wisdom. All right. Oh! What was the DC?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17. That is an 18. Rolled a natural 18 on that one. As it swoops down, you release the spell, you are immediately attempting to be grasped in its talons. That is a 23 to hit.
Marisha: That hits.
Matt: All right. So you then take 23 points of slashing damage to your cow form.
Laura: I thought we were just--
Matt: Oh. Okay. Sorry. You're not in cow form, are you? You're illusioned. You're staying normal?
Marisha: No, I'm normal.
Matt: You're normal. Right. Okay. I thought you were saying you were doing an actual cow form, but no. All right. You take 23 points of slashing damage, and you are currently grappled as it takes right back up into the air, clutching Keyleth within its talons.
Liam: How fast can the rest of us do anything? It's gone?
Matt: Now you guys can react. It is currently 60 feet away from you.
Laura: I immediately-- oh god! I shoot it.
Sam: Do we have to roll for initiative?
Matt: You do.
Laura: But I was notched already.
Matt: Right. I'll give you advantage on your initiative. Because you're notched but you used your last turn to cast Hunter's Mark on it. Everyone roll initiative. You have advantage on it because you were nocked, and because you were ready to react, you have advantage on your initiative check, but everyone else just roll normally. All right. So that is 25 to 20?
Laura: 21.
Matt: 21.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Liam: 17.
Travis: 18.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: Vax. Keyleth. Scanlan? Tiberius? What you guys got?
Sam: Six.
Orion: Five.
Matt: Okay. All right. So Vex, you're up first.
Laura: I'm going to shoot it through the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay. Go for it. Roll for the attack.
Laura: 16.
Matt: 16 hits.
Laura: (counts quietly) 26.
Matt: 26 points of damage. All righty.
Laura: And then I'm going to shoot it again.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: That one definitely hits  26.
Matt: Yeah! That hits.
Laura: 26 again.
Matt: Nice! All right, that brings us to Grog.
Travis: I take the Firebrand Warhammer, activate it, turn on the fire. And I put the Chain of Returning on it and throw it at the winged beast.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll with disadvantage because it's already roughly 40 to 60 feet away from you. It's tough to get there. But you can try.
Travis: 15. Nope. 16.
Matt: Okay. Due to its distance and the dark cover of night, it's harder to hit and you actually swing and throw it and the hammer-- The chain goes taut and it just drops to the ground and it's just out of range of the hammer, as it escapes the range it would have hit it with.
Travis: Can I pull it back?
Matt: Yeah, go for it. That's easy enough, it's not wedged in anything. You don't have to roll for it. All right, so that's your turn. Vax.
Liam: I'd like to use a bonus action to click Boots of Haste together, and I think if I do that, I have two actions at that point, right?
Matt: No. Well you do have an additional action that can be used only to attack.
Liam: Just attack. So what I want to do is click the Boots of Haste together, use the original action to run as far as I can towards the bird, and then use my final action to sneak attack the thing since it's got Keyleth in its talons. That's up to you.
Matt: Okay. The sneak attack will not kick in because Keyleth is not threatening the creature. But you go for the attacks. You rush up, you dash, you get underneath it-- for a moment, because of the Boots of Haste, you keep speed with this giant, darting creature. You, underneath, throw your daggers upward.
Liam: All right. It would just be one-- I mean if I use the dash to run as far as I can, that would leave me with one attack probably?
Matt: One attack and your bonus without the damage bonus.
Liam: I'm trying to be a Boy Scout here. Wouldn't the Boots of Haste clicking be the bonus action? Yeah. That is 22 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: All right. And that's not a whole lot.
Matt: What's the range increment on a dagger?
Liam: That's ten. Ten.
Matt: Ten?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Dagger. Roll again for disadvantage because it's just within your secondary throwing range.
Liam: Oh yeah. Then I missed.
Matt: Okay. It vanishes into the dark night ahead of you. So yeah. That is gone. You still have your Belt of Returning, you just don't have your snake belt. Yeah, don't worry guys. I saw the look on your face and I'm like, no, it's fine. It comes back. Okay. Keyleth, you're up. You're currently grappled and held within the talons of this giant bird. You see the entire ground below you.
Marisha: Judging by the fairly close up appearance I have of him at this point, can I tell it is probably a "beast" nature?
Matt: At the sheer size, it's hard to tell. You've never encountered a beast of this size, but you do look up and you can see the talons that are currently holding you in place and piercing the sides of your armor are bird-like talons. And you do see a series of dark feathers coating the entire underbelly of this entity.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to attempt to cast Dominate Beast.
Matt: Okay. All right.
Marisha: It has to make a wisdom saving throw.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Is your Enhance Ability still active? From before?
Matt: That's for ability checks. So you finish casting the spell. Apparently, this entity is not affected by the spell.
Liam: Fuck-sticks.
Sam: It's not a beast?
Matt: It is not a beast. There's a fine line when certain creatures of nature are altered by some sort of magical essence or their nature perhaps is not natural at the get-go. Either they were created or over time they became something beyond beast. This seems to fall under that category.
Marisha: That's my turn, right?
Matt: That's your turn. That brings us to its turn.
Marisha: Can I try and break the grapple as a bonus action?
Matt: That would be your action to try and break the grapple. For this creature's turn, it does a full double dash of its full flight speed and is about 250 feet away from you and completely out of your guys' reach. You see it (whoosh) up into the sky, disappearing to the north, north-northwest area beyond Emon, carrying Keyleth in its claws.
Liam: Keyleth, just get out of its fucking hands and fall. You can change. We'll catch you; we'll do something! Just fall.
Matt: You're close enough where you can still hear this, as the desperation kicks in and you realize-- seeing your whole party not even visible at this point except a couple of dark dots in the low light of the night.
Sam: Is it our turn yet?
Matt: It now comes to Scanlan's turn.
Sam: Okay. I Dimension Door.
Matt: What's the range on Dimension Door?
Sam: 500 feet.
Matt: You-- and appear where? Where do you want to appear?
Sam: On it. On its back.
Matt: Okay. You appear right on its back. You immediately land and start sliding back as the wind is pushing on you. The feathers themselves, due to the aerodynamic nature of its flight path; it's a lot of wind resistance against you.
Liam: Oh, make an acrobatics check.
Orion: Shush! What the hell?!
Matt: No, I was going there. Don't worry. That's what it is. You need to go ahead and make an acrobatics check to see if you can maintain balance on the back of this beast.
Liam: My intelligence is not six!
Sam: 20!
Matt: You manage to just, you tumble backward a little bit. You grab a couple of feathers and get yourself just on the side underneath where the wing meets part of the upper torso, where the wind resistance is the least amount, and you manage to hold on. You are now clutching the back of this giant bird. That's your turn.
Sam: Okay. As my bonus action, I will inspire Keyleth. Right? She's right next to me?
Marisha: Scanlan? What the shit?
Sam: (singing) The way you kick so much ass like nobody else. The way you do animal things gets me overwhelmed. You don't know. You don't know you're powerful. Oh. That's what makes you powerful.
Matt: Due to the wind, you don't hear the last line. It's too loud around it. However, you can take a d10 inspiration dice.
Laura: Yay!
Marisha: Yay!
Liam: What a heroic move! Amazing!
Matt: Which for the record, this currently right now looks like-- you see the cow clutched below, and currently there is a cow holding onto this giant bird.
Sam: It lasts eight hours.
Matt: This singing tiny cow. You artists out there, have fun with this scene. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. Tiberius.
Orion: Good. I drop Stoneskin. At 5th-level, I go myself, one, two, three-- I cast Fly on all of us. Fly, you fools! And go right after them.
Matt: All right. All of you guys, at that point you see Tiberius and you all take off after him.
Liam: The cows take off into the night sky.
Orion: (shouting) Fly, Vox Machina! Moo!
Marisha: Vox "Moo-china!" (booing)
Matt: A squadron of weirdly-sized, flying cows lit by moonlight, chasing after a giant bird. I love Dungeons and Dragons. (laughter)
Travis: What is this?
Matt: What's the flying speed on Fly?
Orion: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet. Cool.
Orion: I'm going to dash. On that.
Matt: Yep. You guys can go 120 feet every turn. It can go 240. Two rounds pass before you guys realize there is no way you're going to catch up with this thing or get even close to it.
Liam: I've got Haste!
Laura: I've got Hunter's Mark on it, so I can track it.
Liam: Double me, yo! I got Haste.
Matt: Your Haste speed-- your physical body doesn't affect the Fly spell, unfortunately. You're only at the speed that the arcane nature of the spell can take you. I'm just saying. Your metabolism's real fast. Your heartbeat's hummingbirding it. But you're still only going 120 feet. So as you guys follow behind, you can see now, after a while on the edge of the shoreline, not too far from Emon-- maybe what would normally be from horseback or a brisk walk, a half day's travel-- you eventually come upon the-- There it is! You come upon the coastal mountains known as the Shoreline Summit. It's a series of unusually steep mountain bluffs that hug the coastline, northwest of Emon. As you get closer, and at this point you've lost sight of the bird. Scanlan, I want you to go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Sam: Athletics? Well, that doesn't count. That's not good. Athletics? 16.
Matt: 16? Okay. You still manage to keep hold for the portion of the length of the journey. As it moves and shifts and the wind itself is still blowing in your face, though minimized by your current positioning. It's a trial to hold onto this large creature as it makes its wings beat and just the sheer force of its movement. All right. So as you get closer to these mountaintops--
Marisha: Do I have a turn yet?
Matt: You can go ahead and take your turn now too, yes.
Marisha: Yeah? I cast Polymorph on it. You're on it.
Sam: Don't worry about me!
Marisha: Really?
Sam: I'm fine! You never need to worry about me. Haven't you guys learned that by now? I'm fine!
Marisha: Out of thematic reasons, I also turn him into a cow. (laughter)
Sam: That's amazing!
Liam: Is what she cries out heroically.
Matt: Okay. What's the DC on this?
Marisha: My spell DC? 18.
Matt: Rolled a one. (laughter)
Sam: I'm a cow on a cow with a cow!
Matt: So this giant flying bird-- Moo! And just begins to plummet at an extremely fast speed. You both immediately are released from its grasp. Scanlan and Keyleth both are just falling. You guys don't see this. It's too far away from you now. At this point, you're probably close to about 500 feet in the air.
Liam: Yo, I heard you liked cows, so I gave you some cows with your cow.
Matt: I hope this inspires the next Diablo Cow level, guys. You really need to look into this. All right. So you guys are now both plummeting and falling at a really, really rapid speed.
Marisha: I go eagle form.
Matt: Flailing cows. You go eagle form. You're fine. So you go into eagle form. That's your action this turn. That's your bonus action, because you can do that as a--
Marisha: As a bonus action!
Matt: Eagle form. Scanlan, you plummet full speed on this one. You probably have another two rounds before you impact with something very painful.
Liam: But he's as heavy as a dust mote, so he just goes like this all the way down. Right?
Marisha: I don't think that's how it works.
Orion: No, he's a little pebble.
Marisha: I can catch him, if you need catched.
Matt: You guys still continue to give chase. Eventually, you see this giant thing just go and vanish from sight. It's just gone. It just disappeared.
Orion: I go full Gandalf.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Never go full Gandalf.
Matt: You guys are pushing forward. So it's now the next round for you guys to react. What are you doing?
Sam: I will become a pterodactyl.
Matt: So you're casting?
Sam: Polymorph on myself?
Matt: Okay. Because you are falling and this is a lot of wind, I'm going to have to ask you to make a concentration check to complete the spell.
Laura: Come on, Scanlan!
Matt: So go ahead and roll a d20.
Sam: This is a concentration not on holding a spell, but on casting it?
Matt: Correct. Because as part of the components of it and maintaining your attention to the spell--
Marisha: What does he add? His spell attack bonus?
Matt: This? No, this is a d20 and-- let me make sure, yeah-- it's a d20 and then you add your plus five from your charisma.
Sam: Charisma? That's a natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: With that-- (screeches) pterodactyl.
Liam: Tables have turned, motherfucker! Tables have turned!
Orion: You're both flying cows!
Laura: Wait! Was Seeming a concentration?
Orion: I think it lasts for like eight hours.
Laura: Did it drop? Are we no longer cows?
Sam: I think so. I'll check.
Liam: Hey! You're not a cow anymore!
Laura: Oh my god, you're not a cow anymore!
Liam: Oh! Awesome!
Matt: You guys keep flying. You guys catch yourselves.
Sam: Nope, not concentration. It just lasts for eight hours.
Matt: You guys are all still flying cows. You're all still just a squadron of flying, illusory cows, which you guys are both now transformed into an eagle and a pterodactyl, but you still look like cows. (laughter)
Liam: As the twins are flying, I say, hey, did you notice we have the same pattern? Twins!
Matt: About this time, you hear a loud, impactful boom. And there's a cloud of dust partway into the side of this first bit of mountain range that you come upon, a little bit distant from you guys.
Laura: Can I fly down towards it?
Matt: You start heading in that direction. Because of the speed it was traveling at and the way it was carrying at the speed it was going, it's still ahead of you guys. And you see the impact. You hear this loud screeching sound and you see now where there was a little poof of cloud, these wings unfold and (flapping) make its way back up.
Orion: How far away from it are we?
Matt: You guys right now at the close to six minutes you've been traveling--
Marisha: Did it not drop the cow to 0 hit points?
Matt: All the damage carries over.
Liam: The remainder of that damage went into its hit points.
Matt: You don't know. It looks hurt. It looks like it wasn't happy about it. It continues back up. From you Tiberius, it's probably close to 700 to 800 feet away from you. It's because of the speed it was traveling and the speed you guys were following. It was gaining on you every single turn.
Laura: Is it flying away from us now?
Matt: It's heading up into the mountain range.
Liam: Fly after that motherfucker!
Laura: Should we still track it? It's still nighttime, right?
Matt: It's still nighttime, yeah.
Orion: It's only 500 feet away from me right now?
Matt: 600 to 500 feet.
Orion: Okay, cool. Well I'm going for it, still.
Matt: What are you doing?
Laura: We're all following it.
Orion: Where am I? It's taking off right now and I'm over here?
Matt: You're back here. It's now starting to take off and head up towards the top of this mountain range that you're just starting to come upon.
Orion: Okay. If it's doing that, then I'll fucking go higher and try to meet it where it's going.
Matt: Okay. Cool. The rest of you guys continue to give chase. Now that it's returned to its form, it travels an additional double dash: 240 feet. As this progresses, it's far beyond any of you guys in a matter of seconds.
Laura: Is the mountain range really far away?
Matt: No, you've just hit the outskirts of the mountain range. It got there first. You guys just catch up to where it starts and you see it's like now it's dodging through the mountains and is currently no longer in sight. There is a little bit of low cloud cover in this area. A couple drift by and cover a couple of the mountains. But this little cluster of seaside cliffs and mountains, as you get closer, you can see it's dotted with high altitude trees. There's precariously perched goats that are sleeping on elements of the sides of this mountain.
Liam: Can you track it?
Laura: I can track it! Of course.
Matt: So you're keeping your attention on it?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: The winds also are pretty strong as you get close to the mountains. As you coast around each, you start actually diving into this middle valley area.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Does that affect any spells?
Laura: No, it just makes us stealth easier.
Sam: It doesn't drop Hunter's Mark?
Matt: Is it concentration?
Laura: No, it's not concentration; it's an action. Oh wait. (laughs) I don't know if I can tell.
Matt: Is Pass Without a Trace concentration?
Laura: Where does it say it?
Sam: There's a C next to it somewhere.
Laura: Oh, never mind! It's a concentration. Forget it! I don't know how these things work yet.
Sam: Yeah, stick to the bows and arrows.
Matt: Traveling through this area, you can see the mountains. The way that they're constructed in this area, it's not a gradual crag. A lot of these are just punched up in the air, like whatever heavy seismic force that created these initially was very localized and very powerful. A lot of the mountains are spire-like. They come up with very sheer sides and you can see why this mountain range is largely not utilized or traversed or generally spoken of often because it's too dangerous for most average folk to even attempt to climb or use for any good reason. The winds are high and powerful here at the tops, as well. And as you're flying around, the winds blowing across, and you get pushed off your course a little bit here and there, but you still keep up, best as possible. You leading the charge. Over about five minutes of searching through this mountain range, you sense that its movement eventually comes to stop.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: There's a nest.
Sam: Wait, you sense that he came to a stop?
Laura: He came to a stop a little bit ahead of us.
Sam: Let's go get him.
Laura: Can we all try to stealth in?
Sam: I'm a pterodactyl, so--
Marisha: Yeah, let's go for the element of surprise. Well, technically, we're all still cows.
Matt: Yes. And you guys cannot talk because you're actually in creature forms.
Laura: All right. Well, I'm going to try to stealth. Mountains are my favored terrain!
Matt: They are! Do you want to go onto the mountain itself, or are you still flying amongst them?
Laura: Oh, I'll still fly.
Matt: So you would not get the advantage because air is not your favored terrain. So everyone who wishes to, go ahead and roll stealth checks
Marisha: All of us?
Matt: All of you who wish to try and come at it from a quiet--
Sam: (pterodactyl screech)
Matt: What did you roll?
Liam: With advantage, I rolled a two.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm not used to being flying, really.
Sam: Five.
Orion: Are we flying anymore?
Matt: You guys are all still flying, yeah.
Orion: Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, no.
Marisha: 21.
Travis: 14.
Laura: 28.
Matt: Yeah, so. You guys following behind Vex, many of you clumsily and some of you shouting out to each other, "I think she sees it this way." And you're like, "oh my god." You come around this one bend and you can see one of the larger mountainous spires that has a lot of trees and green growth towards the top at certain places where the rock juts out and gives a shelf for such greenery to grow, outside of its sheer outside surface. You do see a couple of wings fold in against the moonlight in what looks to be an outcropping. And there are multiple layers of rock shelves on the side of this mountain. And on one of these outcroppings, there appears to be some sort of a nest: a cluster of almost like actual trees and pieces of wood that are all jammed into this giant nest that's nestled against where the shadow and the moonlight are fighting for some sort of visual on it.
Travis: Big-ass tree fortress.
Laura: Did we just find like a mama bird and baby birds?
Marisha: Yeah, we did.
Laura: What are we going to do?
Liam: We're going to take out the mom and train the babies.
Sam: What are we going to do?
Liam: Yeah. We're going to capture those babies and we're going to train them.
Orion: That's a good idea. I like that idea.
Sam: Like Avatar?
Orion: Yes.
Travis: You could go in.
Laura: Me go in? There's a giant fucking nest here! I get close to it. As close as I feel safe getting to it.
Matt: You guys all stay back or do you go with her?
Orion: I'm going to cast Greater Invisibility on myself and then follow.
Matt: Okay. You guys have 12 seconds before you all plummet.
Orion: Oh wait! No! I don't do that. Damn it! I forget we're still flying.
Travis: What part of the flying part did you forget?
Orion: I thought we'd landed already.
Matt: Are you guys all going with Vex, or are you all staying back and she's going on her own?
Travis: Are we going to lose Fly, or do we keep it?
Matt: Are you casting Greater Invisibility?
Orion: No.
Matt: Then no, you're fine.
Liam: Is it the same stealth roll or an additional stealth roll to go forward at this point?
Matt: No this was your stealth roll on approaching.
Liam: Oh. Well, I mean, I knew I rolled shitty.
Matt: You don't know you rolled shitty.
Travis: I'm going in.
Matt: All right. So Vex and Grog, you approach. Gliding cows, drifting through the night sky.
Laura: This is so stupid.
Travis: Hoof in hoof.
Matt: Okay, yeah. So you guys all realize you must keep close together to Tiberius as you come in. Keeping too much of a distance would be a bad thing. You come upon the underneath portion of this outcropping, and you can see within a quick glance-- go ahead and make a perception check, all of you guys.
Marisha: All of us?
Matt: All of you who are coming up in this cluster.
Travis: Three.
Laura: Do I get an advantage because we're in a mountain environment at all?
Matt: Nope. Actually no. Because you're seeing things on a mountain, I will give you advantage on this.
Laura: Yes!
Marisha: 12.
Matt: 12?
Orion: 16.
Sam: Nothing.
Liam: 13.
Laura: 12.
Matt: So the highest was?
Orion: 16.
Matt: 16. You got?
Travis: Three.
Matt: As you guys all look up, it's very shadowy over here. It's hard to see. The moonlight's in your eye a little bit and the darkness is so pitch. The umbra of this particular shadow is very dark and crushed. You make out, in the nest, the large bird creature has folded its wings and is currently leaning down. And you see something in the nest that's much smaller moving up next to it.
Marisha: I don't want to kill a mama.
Laura: But she's killing the farmers' stuff.
Marisha: Maybe we can transplant her.
Sam: To a wildlife preserve?
Laura: Maybe. And her babies?
Marisha: Capture her and move her away from town?
Liam: That seems complicated.
Sam: Are they on the highest peak?
Matt: No. There's two other levels up above this. This one just is one of the largest outcroppings.
Sam: I'm going to swoop up over them. See if there's any boulders to drop.
Matt: Okay. Looking over it, there are no loose rocks or boulders. In fact, because of the construction of these mountains, they're solid spires that jut up and then abruptly end. All the erosion that happens here appears to be gradual enough-- that's why the sides of the mountains are so smooth and unclimbable.
Marisha: So there's a sheer peak and they're nested on the side of it?
Matt: Yeah. It's a sheer peak that rounds off at the very top and there are little outcroppings that jut out in places as it goes down. But those are more towards the top, and as you go down further-- as most of the erosion hits the mountain lower and lower, it has carved off or destroyed most of what would have been previous outcroppings, or smoothed them over.
Travis: How far away are we now?
Matt: You guys are probably a good 60 or 50 feet if you're trying to get up within range of your Fly. Right? What's the range of on that? Fly?
Sam: Fly? Oh, here.
Matt: I got it. No! There is no range on it. You just touch them. So you're fine. Yeah. As long as you're concentrating on it, you're fine.
Travis: So we're within 60 feet?
Matt: Well, you guys have been keeping a little more of a distance down here. However, at this point, as you guys are all encroaching and Scanlan's gone overhead, a voice rings out against the darkness, "Flying cows? Really? I care not for this insolence. If you've come to mock me or fight me, do it now! Or leave this creature alone!"
Laura: What? Where are you? Who are you? Who said that?
Orion: I rolled an arcana check of 17 of my surroundings-- where it's coming from.
Laura: Ditto. I try to perceive where it's coming from.
Matt: Okay. Arcana check-- there's nothing arcane in nature. It's not omnipresent or coming from any certain place. There is a direction it's coming from, which is from the outcropping or nest area. There's nothing arcane in nature to it. It's in the shadow. You can't really see it from this distance.
Laura: Is it in front of us? To the side of us? Is it coming from where the bird seems to be?
Matt: It's coming from where the bird is.
Liam: He's controlling it.
Marisha: I fly over as an eagle.
Laura: You still look like a cow eagle.
Marisha: Can we drop Seeming?
Matt: It's not under your control, and you can't talk, too.
Travis: Okay. I yell out, you've been stealing the farmers' livestock. Give us a reason not to kill you.
Sam: That's good. That's good. Diplomacy.
Orion: Or, I mean, moo!
Matt: Okay. You guys are all keeping distance from it? The voice comes out again, "Your nature confuses me and your words seem ill-informed. If you're not going to come to speak of discourse, I'm going to assume that that you're my enemy."
Orion: Then, as he's saying that, I'll approach.
Matt: So Tiberius cow goes.
Orion: And as I approach the thing, I'm going to Dispel Magic on myself.
Matt: Okay. Cool. For Dispel Magic, I need you to go ahead, just for the sake of this-- I won't consider it contested because you're allies in this thing. So you land. Tiberius' form shimmers and returns back to that of a dragonborn, and you're standing there on the precipice. Go ahead and roll a perception check.
Orion: What is that? 11.
Matt: Okay. It's hard to make out the details, but the voice is definitely coming from the nest. You see there is something vaguely humanoid, but it's hard to make out the shape at this distance with this low light, especially since you aren't a darkvision-gifted entity. However, it's close to this bird creature.
Orion: I'm going to say, is this big bird thing asleep?
Matt: "You will not harm this creature, poachers!"
Orion: I'm not trying to harm it at all. I'm just seeing if it's fine. If we could talk. I can't see anything, and I wanted to cast Light so I could see something, but I don't want to hurt your bird's eyes.
Matt: You can see the bird's moving and it's looking towards your direction. And it has this like (soft snarl).
Orion: So it's awake?
Matt: It's awake, and it looks hurt. The voice is like, "You come here masqueraded as whatever manner of beasts that you are--"
Orion: Cows. We were cows.
Matt: "After tormenting and severely wounding this beautiful creature."
Orion: We didn't do anything to the creature. No, we were-- This creature was stealing the farmer's cows, and the farmers were saying, "You've taken our livestock," which is hurting the farm. We came to help them and we posed as cows, and then your bird took our--
Liam: While he's blithering, can I make an additional cow stealth check?
Matt: To?
Liam: To come up behind the guy. Near him. Not even near him. Just to get a better vantage point.
Matt: Go for it. Make it with a disadvantage.
Liam: Does that cancel out with my advantage from my cloak?
Laura: A cow in a cloak.
Matt: You are a flying cow in the moonlight against an individual that is very aware of your presence.
Liam: Shut up, baby, I know it. (laughter)
Liam: That is good.
Laura: That's 31.
Liam: Yeah. 31.
Matt: (chuckles) You stealthily cow your way up to the side of this precipice. Seemingly unnoticed. Getting a view of this creature now, you can see this nest is a cluster of driftwood and chunks of shipwreck and carts and wagon wheels and whatever pieces of wood have been scavenged from different time periods. Some are weathered, some are more fresh. And trees, whole trees that are broken and shredded have all been cobbled together to make this nest. In the center of this-- I'm going to take the intensity down on this a little bit-- you see, there up against this bird-- and the bird itself is twitching and looks like it's hurt. Not deeply hurt, but hurt. You see a small humanoid. Pretty small. Scanlan small. Hard to make out details, but it is currently in the process of doing a repeated hand motion and then touching. A hand motion and then touching. And you've seen this motion before.
Liam: Touching what?
Matt: Touching the bird. There is a perpetual string of Cure Wounds being applied to this bird.
Marisha: I also approach and come out of my eagle form.
Orion: Light.
Sam: Are you landing somewhere?
Marisha: Next to Tiberius.
Orion: But I'm going to block it with my hand so it's not going to blind the bird.
Matt: Okay.  As the light picks up, you can see the bird turns away for a second and starts to like flap its wings instinctually. And once again, seeing it up close, this bird is really big. The humanoid entity becomes immediately visible. And it is a gnome. You can see, he's dressed in hides and roughly crafted leather and furs. He has tousled, greasy black hair that hangs past his shoulders, covering a bedraggled and bearded face. Holding up his arm-- and looks thin. It's covering the light and he's like, "You!"
Orion: Sorry. I tried to not blind you. It was very dark. I'm sorry. Hello. We mean you no harm.
Matt: The gnome slams this small wooden, for lack of a better term, a small staff or cane. Slams it into the ground with a foot stomp and you can see the gnome's entire body suddenly begin to shift and change into this dark, gnarled-looking, hard surface.
Liam: I whack him in the back of the head.
Laura: No! It's just Barkskin! It's just defense!
Matt: He doesn't know. All right. So you cow stealth up to the side of this guy.
Liam: Let's get ready to rumble.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make an attack.
Liam: I pause.
Matt: You pause? You are currently now crouched right behind the edge of this nest, and you can't even actually see the guy anymore because in order to get up there, you've come underneath to stay hidden and you're just there behind.
Marisha: Can I see Vax?
Matt: No. Well, actually go ahead and roll a perception check. Is it higher than a 31?
Marisha: Is it higher than a 31? No.
Matt: You have no idea where Vax is.
Sam: I'm way up above them still, right? Do I see anything?
Matt: No, actually. You see, there's another section above there. It looks like there's nothing else of interest, other than some growth, a few bushes, and some vines that hang down the side.
Travis: Somebody talk to him before I kill this fucking bird.
Orion: I am talking to him.
Marisha: I land beside Tiberius and come out of eagle form. Tiberius, would you please Dispel this cow form from me. Please? Thank you.
Matt: Okay. And with that, you cast Dispel Magic and Keyleth's form reverts that to Keyleth. Normal Keyleth. Non-cow Keyleth. The gnome character now has the staff at the back and has a hand in front and is like, (panting).
Marisha: Are you a druid? I'm also a druid. I think our goals might be aligned.
Matt: "Really?"
Marisha: It's okay. What's her name?
Matt: "This creature has no name to it yet. I, myself, am a protector of the wild, as you claim to be, as well. I have no tribe but the trees around me. I hear the whisper of the wind, and it calls for justice."
Marisha: I can relate to that.
Matt: "Then why do you follow? Why do you insist on harming this creature?"
Marisha: Because we were seeking justice for other people.
Matt: "Why? For the civilized folk of the city? You should know more than most. They sit there, taking beautiful creatures of nature, making them fat and formless and worth nothing. To slaughter them without life and purpose to their existence."
Orion: The life and purpose of their existence is to keep those other people alive.
Matt: "And why is it not the same with this creature? If they cannot guard their livestock, why is it not food for this thing, as well? It is the natural life cycle that they've removed themselves from."
Orion: When one has an establishment, when one grows its own crop, and one steals something, it is considered a crime.
Matt: "Well, when one is not part of that civilization, but the civilization of the world as a whole, which requires hunting for what keeps you alive, perhaps that does not sink or hang on my conscience."
Orion: Fair point.
Marisha: Let's not let this escalate. Okay? What is your name?
Matt: "I was once called Byron."
Marisha: Vyron?
Matt: "Byron."
Marisha: Byron.
Matt: "I have not heard my name nor spoken words for many years."
Orion: Would you not like to be called Byron, or would you like something else, like B-roy or B-man? My name's Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia. And this is my friend Keyleth, who is also a druid. And we also have a friend who is a gnome who sings songs and whatnot.
Matt: The bird, now looking of much better health than it was when it arrived, now flutters its wings out in a stretching motion. And as it does, its head glides down and looks right towards you. This giant beak that looks like it could snap you in two with a single bite.
Marisha: I reach up to it and reach out to pet its beak.
Matt: I'm going to ask you to make an animal handling check on this. Just to see where this goes.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I gently start swooping down to check on my friends.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: All right. The large bird-type creature retracts from your attempted touch and begins to rear back into the nest in a defensive position. Doesn't bite your hand off.
Marisha: I kneel down a bit. Produce a few Goodberries. Reach out.
Sam: Bye, Keyleth. This is how we lose one of our members. Feeding a bird.
Matt: The creature leans forward and the giant bird, you can see its dark, black eyes staring at you. Each eye probably about the size of your torso. As the giant beak comes down, you can see the moonlight gliding off the smooth exterior of the dark black beak. It smells. And you take 27 points of piercing damage as the animal takes the Goodberries and almost your entire hand with it, as well. At that size, it's hard to be gentle.
Marisha: It's okay. It's all right.
Matt: So you retract your hand, which is now essentially in many ways, bones are broken, feels like. There's blood streaming down the side of your hand, and (dripping).
Marisha: That's a good girl.
Sam: Is it?
Matt: Swallows.
Sam: Is it a good girl?
Orion: I'm feeding a tiny snack to Lockheed.
Marisha: I turn back to Byron--
Sam: And say, ow.
Marisha: Yeah, and go, that hurt. Now. Please listen to me. Please, please listen to me. We did come here to kill the giant creature.
Matt: "I had assumed."
Marisha: But upon seeing the situation, upon approach, realized the situation and decided amongst all of us that we did not want to bring such a great creature to its death.
Matt: Scanlan, you've landed by now. A pterodactyl. A cow-looking pterodactyl.
Orion: As he swoops, I've never seen anything quite like it.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Orion: I'm going to aid her, too.
Sam: All I've seen so far is Keyleth's bloody hand.
Marisha: 20 total.
Matt: You have advantage on this because Tiberius is aiding you on this conversation.
Marisha: I'll take that 20 total.
Matt: All right. He looks at you. "Well, shall you leave us, then?"
Marisha: Under one condition.
Matt: "There's always a condition. You call yourself a druid, yet you speak like the civilized folk. I get the feeling that perhaps your connection to nature has not been tended to for some time."
Orion: No, she really knows her stuff. I mean, we just fought this fire guy--
Marisha: Just because one can appreciate nature, does not mean that one cannot also appreciate humanity.
Matt: "Well, this beautiful creature is the only surviving young of a clutch, bred by a majestic roc high in the Cliffkeep Mountains. Its mother now lies dead, slain by the brutal giants that wander those peaks. This young'un is all that remains of that clutch and the memory of that blessed entity."
Travis: That's a young'un?
Matt: This is a young one. "This new home serves us well. Abundance of feed. Lack of large, predatory creatures. I believe this is where we'll stay."
Marisha: Question. If this is a young, adolescent creature, what do you think of the destruction it could cause once it reaches full adulthood? Are you okay with having that on your conscience? This creature could result in the lives of many. If you relocate out of town, just a few miles. Say like 50 or 100 or so because this thing's really damn big. So I'm sure it's got a pretty big-- you know what I mean.
Orion: Or just the other way.
Marisha: I will help you. I will personally come with you and tend to their safety. And make sure that their location is proper and safe, and handled with respect. Then you will be out of the harms of poachers. You can live off the land, and you can be free and alone.
Matt: "Do you think we came straight to this mountain range? Do you think this is the first nest we've constructed? Me and this lone survivor have scoured the length of this side of Tal'Dorei. This, as far as I can see, is the safest. It's the most ignored by nearby civilization."
Marisha: Listen--
Sam: I'm going to drop Seeming and also drop my form of pterodactyl.
Matt: All of you now, your forms change. As this happens mid-sentence, it's noticed immediately by the gnome druid, who's like (gasps).
Marisha: Yes! That is correct. Listen. We are being nice. Don't think that we will be the first. You will have more people come and hunt you and kill this, as this beast continues. How long do you think you can survive waves of mercenaries coming to try and kill this? We are the nice ones. I suggest you heed our warning, take our help, and save the life of you and your creature in the long run.
Matt: "You have yet to provide a suitable alternative."
Orion: Oh! I might have an idea.
Marisha: There is an alternative. Tiberius can tell you of that alternative.
Orion: Yes! See, your creature is rather large and powerful, yes? You have a rather strong bond with him, which is quite unique with such a unique looking creature.
Marisha: I was setting you up for an awesome one-liner, man! You were supposed to be like, the other option is death.
Liam: Ask him if he's considered Whitestone?
Orion: Whitestone? Yeah! Well, I guess there's a couple of options, really. There's this town Whitestone that's pretty great and has a lot of livestock that this creature can consume.
Marisha: Yeah, I don't know about that.
Matt: Go ahead and make a deception check.
Orion: That is a 24.
Matt: "Whitestone. How far is this Whitestone?"
Marisha: Wait! No! Hang on! No! This is getting out of control already. I will not let you all do this! No! Not today. You guys have caused enough problems. We are not going to push this creature on other people. I'm trying, all right? I'm working on it. I don't want to push this problem off on a town that's already being held hostage by vampires. That fucking sucks! That's double shitting on them.
Orion: Well, the other option was, like I was saying, perhaps you can form an agreement with Emon. I'm sure it would pay in livestock rather well for the protection of you, such a powerful druid, over at least a section of the land. In exchange for free food for your friend.
Matt: "You, dragon man, are adorably naive of the ways of men and those that lie and deceive. I have yet to have met any civilized people who have kept their word when it came to creatures like this."
Laura: Can I come forward? All right. What about Vasselheim? Not in the city, but outside of it. There's plentiful forests, tons of giant creatures it could feed on.
Orion: That's right! That's true!
Marisha: That actually is fairly true.
Laura: There's so many monsters out there, they don't hunt them all because there's too many.
Orion: That's a wonderful idea, Vex. Yes!
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Orion: I'll aid her, as well.
Matt: I'll say you've aided one person recently. This'll just be her check on this. He really doesn't trust you, given the current circumstances.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Natural 20.
Laura: Then as a natural 20, you know that's good for you. That's the best place you can go. You can see the wisdom in my persuasion.
Orion: It is true, though. I mean, it's just feed walking all around for it.
Marisha: Please, please listen to us. We're only trying to help.
Sam: Is there a young creature around here besides the--
Matt: No, looking about you, no.
Sam: There's no babies there?
Matt: No. This is the young. This bird is like the adolescent.
Marisha: Please believe me. I let this thing almost take my hand off, and I'm still standing here fairly cogently talking to you, so please take that as a sign of honesty.
Laura: I go and put my hand on her back and cast Cure Wounds, because I got that spell now, yo!
Sam: Where are we telling them to go?
Travis: To Vasselheim.
Sam: Vasselheim?
Marisha: Listen. She's right. We have friends in Vasselheim. We can contact the Slayer's Take. We're a part of their guild. We can tell them that you're coming. They'll not bother you. We can tell them they are not allowed to take out a contract on your creature. You will not be harmed.
Laura: Don't bring up contracts, Keyleth. Maybe just don't even bring it up.
Marisha: Because they don't have mercenaries out there. It has to be approved! So it's really good.
Matt: "And what's to stop them from hunting down a majestic creature as rare as this one?"
Orion: Us!
Matt: "You, who live here in Emon?"
Orion: Yes. No, us who are members of the guild.
Matt: "So you also are monster slayers, who come here under the guise to slay this monster?"
Orion: No! Not here. Other places that we're forced to do it. But still we're members.
Matt: "It's too much talk."
Travis: Can we kill this thing now? You guys are doing awesome.
Marisha: I feel like I've done pretty damn good! Come on, man!
Sam: I start speaking in Gnome to him. Listen. Earlier, you said that this place was perfect. It was safe. There were no large predators. Well, you're looking at six large predators. We'll keep hunting you down and hunting your beast down until you get out of here. This is your one and only warning. You must leave, and you must leave now. We're giving you a good choice, a safe choice. We can help you get there and be safe there. But if you don't listen to us, we'll start killing.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Marisha: How many fucking persuasion rolls does this asshole need?
Sam: Persuasion?
Matt: This is essentially a conversational skill challenge. So every success and failure leads towards where the conversation's going to end.
Sam: 32.
Matt: He gives you a look. Very intense, looking into your very essence-type stare. His little beady gnomish eyes meeting yours. (sighs) "If we're going to make this journey to where you say this Vasselheim is, how far is it?"
Sam: Several days' journey.
Laura: It's just across the water. You could fly no problem over it.
Matt: "Across the sea?"
Travis: It's across the sea.
Sam: We can draw you a map. We can give you provisions. We'll even make sure the farmers provide you with a few pieces of livestock to chow down on before the journey. A parting gift to fuel up before the big ride. We can give you papers to hand to the Slayer's Take that will ensure that you'll be treated fairly.
Orion: I'll take out my Scroll of Telescription and start writing a note.
Matt: He looks back towards Keyleth, looks back at Scanlan, looks back at Keyleth, looks up at the bird.
Marisha: Please. We really don't need another death on our conscience today.
Matt: "Then looks like we don't have much of a choice, do we? If you can assure us enough food to get across on this journey, we'll make our way towards this Vasselheim. I pray on the solidarity between our kin, and our kin, that you speak the truth that resonates this moment. Because if it does not, may the fall of this entity and myself weigh on your conscience."
Orion: I flip over the note that I'm writing to him and then I trigger it (flying noise) as he's reading it.
Matt: All right. It (poof) vanishes. "As the sun rises, two sizable pieces of livestock to be placed at the boundaries of the usual hunting site. If those are there, and it is taken without any sort of aggression, we'll take that as a sign that you are being honest, and we shan't bother you or your people any further."
Sam: I bow deeply and when I do, it goes (cowbell ringing).
Matt: For a moment, you think you hear a slight, uncontrollable chuckle from the gnome.
Orion: As that's going on, because we're going to head back right now to seal this up, right? Then I'll do my Teleportation Circle. Which is closer to the northeast: the Lyceum or the Keep?
Matt: To the north side of it? That would be the Lyceum.
Laura: We could fly back pretty fast. Couldn't we?
Matt: If he has another Fly spell, you could take it right back.
Laura: Yeah, we can just fly back.
Marisha: Before he leaves. Well, wait! We've got to go to the farm.
Sam: We've got to go to the farmers. We've got to buy some cows off them.
Marisha: And I tell him, if you're up that way, there's a druidic tribe, a little village called Pyrah. They're Fire Ashari. You can find their headmaster Cerkonos. He's a friend. You might find your people there. Who knows? Maybe friends will do you good.
Matt: "Ashari, you say? My dealings with them have been mixed. Perhaps I'll keep my distance."
Laura: Can I see if there's any feathers dropped from the giant bird creature?
Matt: There are ample around.
Laura: Can I grab a few of them?
Matt: As you go and reach up, slaps you across the knuckles.
Laura: Can I have a feather that he dropped?
Matt: "Why?"
Laura: Because they're beautiful. You have to admit they're beautiful.
Matt: (sighs) "Elves. All right."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: You take three roc feathers.
Travis: They're huge, right?
Matt: Yeah. They're almost boat size.
Orion: I put one in my Bag of Holding, too.
Matt: You guys manage to get one for you and three for you guys before he's like, "Now go! Now! My patience wears thin. I'm through with talking words." (sighs)
Sam: Sorry.
Liam: I walk out from behind him and just walk past.
Matt: (yelps)
Sam: (laughs) Sorry about that.
Orion: All right. I'll burn another 5th-level and then fly us all out.
Matt: Okay. You guys coast back to the north side of Emon. You go to the door where the Klaus family is, and you speak with them for a while. You manage to convince them of the situation and what seems to be a mutually positive circumstance. They agree it's better to lose two cows than continue this.
Laura: I pay them for their two cows. Being nice, man!
Matt: How much do you give them?
Laura: How much are cows usually worth?
Matt: You've never purchased a cow, so you don't know.
Laura: Yes I have! I purchased Dork the ox.
Matt: An ox is not a cow.
Laura: Shit! How much do your cows normally cost, darling?
Matt: This is a good question. Let me look in the book. I've not had to look up the cost of a cow before. I would put it at about maybe 40 gold each.
Laura: That's way more than I expected.
Matt: Because they can be used for meat, they can be used for milk.
Laura: 40 gold each to make up for the loss of your cows.
Matt: "Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate you helping with this. And you promise, this will--"
Sam: Yes, just put them out in the open field.
Travis: We'll take them.
Sam: Oh, we'll take them?
Travis: We'll put them out there. Stake them.
Sam: Okay, we'll take care of it.
Matt: You guys take two of the cows. You bring them to the outskirts. With rope tied around their neck, you essentially hitching-post them to the outside of this open area, about 20 to 30 feet from the actual holding pen. A few hours go by, and the sun slowly begins to rise.
Laura: Along with some other food, right?
Matt: Place some of their feed and things around there. Eventually, the sun begins to rise across the eastern sky. As it crests, you can see some of the farmers come out, anxiously watching from their homes. You see different families gathering. The wings beating in the air, and it swoops down (swoosh) and grabs two of them. You can see some of the families gasp and rush inside, and some are amazed to see this even happen. It takes the two, carries them up, and heads out over the Ozmit Sea, passing to the northwest side, and over the next 30 or so minutes, slowly disappears over the horizon until it's no longer visible.
Travis: The sun rose, right? Can I make a beard check? (laughter)
Matt: You may.
Travis: Two, zero.
Matt: With that, (creak) the beginnings of the other side of your beard slowly begins to set in.
Travis: What happens to the existing side?
Matt: The existing side has rounded itself off to a nice beard. It's pretty much where it's going to be on that side. The other side is now starting to finally catch up. And that's where we'll end: on a successful beard check.
Sam: Wow. That was a crazy night.
Travis: Perspiration was happening.
Marisha: Yeah, it was.
Sam: I gave you my hand.
Matt: More battle maps that will never get used.
Laura: Look at us not fighting things. That's really beautiful.
Matt: That would have been really bad, too.
Laura: I'm glad we didn't fight it.
Travis: Bad for us?
Matt: Well, just imagine a giant bird that grabs you and then drops you off the side of a mountain. Would have been an interesting fight. Cool. That concludes a unique Percy-less bottle episode of Critical Role.
Travis: Squadron of cows.
Matt: Squadron of flying midnight cows. That is probably the weirdest thing that's ever-- no, there's been weirder. That's in the top five of weird things that's happened in DND for me.
Sam: Fighting "formootion." (groaning) [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, here, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons.
Travis: Damn it! Damn it! It was perfect.
Matt: No, I got it right this time. Careful what you wish for. But yeah, so thank you for joining us! Last week was kind of a crazy episode, and this week we continue that theme. However, I do want to go over some quick announcements, so we can get the show on the road, get as much game time as possible. Looks like we are going to be down one Scanlan Shorthalt tonight. Unfortunately, Sam Riegel had scheduling stuff he couldn't get around, but we do have our other fantastic gnome, Ashley Johnson, joining us from New York. (cheering)
Travis: Ashley Johnson. Pike is amazing.
Matt: So yeah, that's cool. This is our 40th episode. 40th episode. That's crazy to me.
Marisha: Which we could have waited and celebrated 50th episode, but fuck it. 40 it is.
Laura: Well, we'll celebrate 50th like a motha.
Liam: We told ourselves 40 and done.
Laura: So this is the last episode, you guys. Hope you've had fun.
Matt: Hopefully not. I certainly hope not. We'll see how tonight goes. So yeah, that'll be cool and we're gonna have our anniversary coming up in March too, which will be fun, so excited for that. Yeah, so--
Laura: Oh my gosh, will our 50th time up with our year? We got to figure this math out.
Taliesin: Four episodes in February.
Matt: Close, we'll see. That would be crazy.
Taliesin: No. No, it won't, but close.
Matt: No, I don't think so, but anyway, couple of quick announcements, just a reminder we're going to be at Wizard World Portland, February 20th-21st, so if you guys are in the area and want to come say hello, we'll be there for those two days.
Travis: Come out and say hi!
Matt: Yes, do it. We'll be doing signings. We'll have panels Saturday and Sunday, so it should be a fun time and hopefully we'll see you there. Me and Marisha will be in Denver for Colorado Anime Fest the weekend before that, for Valentine's day weekend in Denver, Colorado. So if you guys are in that area, you can come and visit us, also for fun panels and insanity that shall ensue. So look forward to that. Also, me and Marisha will be in Ireland, we can now announce, at the beginning of March. For Kaizoku Con. In Ireland so--
Liam: That's as Irish as it can gets.
Matt: Yeah, Kaizoku? I know, isn't it? It's an old Gaelic term. (laughter)
Matt: But we've never been. We're excited to come out and see that side of the UK and that part of Europe real fast. It's going to be really cool. So we look forward to seeing you guys out there hopefully.
Taliesin: I've got one, too. I've got one too. I'm going to be, the weekend before that as well, the Valentine's Day weekend, at Amazing Arizona Comic Con. Amazing Arizona Comic Con. It's going to be amazing. In Arizona. With comics.
Marisha: Are you going to be raising Arizona?
Taliesin: Wow. You're fired. You're razing Arizona with fire.
Travis: Get those out of the way now.
Matt: 2d6 damage. (laughter)
Matt: Anybody else have any other events coming up they want to mention, if anything, anyone? No? If one pops up, you're welcome to jump in. Let's see, we also have a few projects that recently came out. Liam, since you are partly at helm of both of these projects.
Liam: Oh, I voice directed on two games. They're the exact same game, basically. One is called 'The Witness.' Mastermind Jonathan Blow has created a very, very unique game. There's no shooting people in the face or any of that, but it looks to be one of the best gaming experiences of the year.
Travis: It's getting amazing reviews.
Liam: And then I also directed the voices for-- And Ashley Johnson is in The Witness. And I also got to direct most of the voiceover for, what's it called? Lego Marvel Avengers, which everybody--
Laura: Oh, what's the name of that? Oh yeah, Lego Marvel Avengers.
Liam: You've heard of it. Show of hands, who's doing a voice in the game? Aww. Well, next one.
Taliesin: That's okay. I'm down to play it. I don't want anything spoiled, and casting for Ms. Marvel.
Liam: She was the first and last person I thought of.
Ashley: Wait! Who did they cast as Ms. Marvel?
Matt: Ashly Burch.
Ashley: (gasps) Really?
Matt: Yeah. First canonical voice for the new Ms. Marvel.
Taliesin: Isn't that hardcore?
Liam: Also unique fun fact  Ashley is playing the character she played in the Avengers movie, so her Lego figure looks like her.
Laura: What? That's amazing.
Ashley: Forgot about that. (laughter)
Ashley: We did it a little bit ago and I think I completely forgot. Very excited. (laughter)
Matt: You know you've made it when. Well, cool. So congrats! Yeah, go play them, guys. Let's see. Also, a reminder for Wyrmwood Gaming, who makes awesome wooden game stuff. They're still supporting our special code to get free shipping when you order from them.
Liam: That code is 'critrole'. Critrole. You get free shipping if you type in 'critrole', but you got to do it on their website, not other websites.
Matt: Yeah, doesn't work well if you go to like Bed, Bath and Beyond. We don't have a relationship with them. Yet.
Taliesin: We should register at very least, at this point.
Matt: We're working on it. We're working on it. We think there is a lot of great crossover, like the Venn diagram between Bed, Bath and Beyond enthuasiasts and Critters. So, do we have any other announcements anyone wants to make or shall we dive on in?
Marisha: We haven't plugged them in a while. Our wonderful charity that we support: 826LA. Go check them out. There's still a huge portion of our proceeds that go to 826LA every week and-- Well, they tutor children through the ages of kindergarten and 18, because kindergarten is an age, and help in creative writing and storytelling, and they also have cool store fronts all the way across the country. There's one in like San Fran. I know there's one in New York.
Taliesin: There's a pirate store. There's a superhero store.
Marisha: I think there's one in Seattle.
Travis: Plus you are handing out D&D to young kids, getting them started and hooked at a young age.
Marisha: Yes. Yeah, if you have an 826 in your area, you should go there and tutor, and you should be like 'Hey.'
Laura: You should go to there.
Marisha: You should go to there and you should tutor to there and you should introduce D&D to them.
Taliesin: Run a D&D game for kids.
Marisha: Run a D&D game for kids. It's very fulfilling.
Matt: That's cool.
Ashley: Oh, I want to give a shoutout.
Matt: Yeah, Ashley, go for it.
Ashley: There's this place that pretty close to where I live called The Brooklyn Strategist. Yeah, and when Laura and Travis came to visit-- It's basically a gaming shop and you can play D&D there on Wednesday nights and Saturdays. And play board games. It's also a coffee shop. It's rad.
Liam: Brooklyn?
Travis: They got like cookies and a little coffee thing.
Laura: I bought a Millennium Falcon cookie when I was there.
Travis: It was pretty dope.
Ashley: It was delicious.
Marisha: What was it called again, Ashley?
Ashley: The Brooklyn Strategist. Check it out if you're in New York or Brooklyn.
Matt: There you go. Do it.
Travis: What else can we do to put off dying by four ancient dragons?
Laura: I know.
Liam: What else can we talk about for the next four hours?
Taliesin: Look at all that--
Matt: Nothing. We're going to jump right into it. All right, guys, so welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role. So to get you up to speed real fast: the group Vox Machina, after finishing their foray in Whitestone, finding a member of the council, Riskel Daxio, was a cult member for this entity called Vecna, bringing him to justice and executing him in the throne room of the palace of Emon, they discovered during the search the traveling troupe of Dr. Dranzel's performance troupe, which Scanlan used to be a part of. During this time, they hatched a plan to have Vox Machina seek this house that had fallen into disarray, and the owner disappeared for a while, that may contain some goods. The party went and investigated. They had previously been in the house and were curious as to where it stands at this point in time, especially if more people are disappearing into it. Upon going into what was once General Krieg's house where they once fought a blue dragon, they discovered the corpse of Krieg, long-buried from the collapse of the cavern and picked apart by some other large clawed creature. And immediately got into some sort of a fight with a purple worm and a frost worm that were essentially battling over whatever it was that was moving in that tunnel that seemed to be nice and tasty. These adolescent worm creatures, not even fully grown, proved a nice little challenge, but the party managed to succeed in escaping after killing them, before the mother showed up. They returned to Emon, managed to help Scanlan's now-discovered daughter, Kaylie, out of a little pinch in getting imprisoned after she'd gotten into a major bar brawl. And the party returned to their keep, where they were notified that Uriel, the Sovereign of Tal'Dorei and the city state of Emon, had an announcement to make in the Cloudtop District. So gathered Gilmore, gathered the rest of the party, and everyone went to the Cloudtop District around noon at the presentational stage-- not at noon, at dusk. Sorry, the other one. So, at which point Uriel announced that he felt he was no longer a worthy leader or ruler of this entire realm he has under his watch and is deciding to step down. During this announcement, however, a number of strange entities came through the clouds in the sky as a series of chromatic ancient dragons swooped in and began to destroy the city of Emon. Many of the townsfolk gathered at that square were immediately killed. The party as well as a few straggling survivors ran away as both the large, gargantuan black and green dragon begin to chase you down. Right before they honed in to pick you off, an even larger ancient red dragon shoved them off to head east to continue their plot after slamming down into the center of Emon and claiming it as his own domain. The party escaped via the druid's Transport Via Plants spell and just stepped through the tree to land in the center of their keep of Greyskull. So now we pick up where that left off. So as you all come rushing through the other side of the transport spell, each one of you comes stumbling out into the center of the temple to Sarenrae that's constructed on the base floor of your keep. The sheer intensity and force that pushes you all through one after another, some of you end up tripping and catching yourself, but nevertheless you all make it through safe and sound before the large tree trunk behind you, the portal, snaps shut, the magic exhausted. The adrenaline still pumping in your head, you're all still thinking over and processing what exactly had just happened and what it means.
Travis: Are we all here?
Marisha: All those people.
Taliesin: Yes? Yes?
Travis: Is anyone hurt?
Taliesin: That's a good question.
Marisha: Can we see anything from here?
Matt: Looking around right now, you have the stained glass of the complex. The keep seems to be in order. From this perspective, you don't see anything because the city is on the opposite side of the keep. This portion of the temple is actually facing southward.
Taliesin: I suppose I'd like to get a vantage point, to see what we can see. Is there any way to-- I think we all took damage. I think we're all hurt.
Travis: We're all hurt a little bit.
Liam: Pike, heal?
Ashley: Yeah, let me do some healing.
Matt: Pike, be aware, as part--
Ashley: I don't know where I'm at.
Matt: Yeah, I'll let you know where you are at. You cast, let's see, you cast Heal once, which I believe was your 6th-level spell, and then you cast Mass Cure Wounds, so a 5th-level spell. So you've cast a 6th and a 5th.
Ashley: One 6th and one 5th?
Matt: Correct.
Ashley: Okay. All right, and then healthwise, where am I at? Went down 66?
Matt: Healthwise, you were down 66 and then you healed up, I don't remember the exact number. It was like 24. We'll go with 24. It's fine.
Ashley: Okay guys, let's do a Mass Cure Wounds then at fourth level.
Matt: Okay. Which one is this? Are you casting Cure Wounds?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: On who?
Ashley: A Mass Cure Wounds, sorry.
Matt: Mass Cure Wounds is a 5th-level spell.
Ashley: How low is everybody?
Travis: I'm all right.
Liam: I'm all right.
Laura: 43, but if we can take a short rest, we can roll some dice.
Marisha: I'm at 32, so same thing.
Taliesin: 57.
Travis: Short rest?
Ashley: Short rest.
Marisha: We should get inside, anyways.
Taliesin: Let's get inside. I want to see if I can get a vantage from the top.
Liam: I think in the short term, we need to take care of two things: one, get a vantage point and see how the keep is and what we can see from above. We also need to get the staff out of here, we need to send them away immediately.
Taliesin: Do we send them away or do we send them down below? Like for shelter?
Laura: We don't need them running out.
Taliesin: It's safer than running around outside, that's where I want to end up.
Laura: Send them below.
Liam: Out of the city, though, into the wild?
Laura: If we need to, we can bring them through the portal into Whitestone.
Marisha: We don't know what all is safe right now.
Liam: I'm all right, so I'm going to go find the staff and herd them down below and tell them what has happened.
Taliesin: You can put them in my workshop. Actually--
Marisha: Why don't we all head down there?
Taliesin: Yes, let's head down to my workshop because I have to unlock it anyway.
Matt: Pike, are you not casting Cure Mass Wounds? You have one more 5th-level spell, so you could do if you wanted.
Ashley: Yeah, let me go ahead and do it.
Matt: Okay. So I believe that's 3d8 plus five, unless I'm mistaken.
Liam: This one's on everyone?
Matt: This was on, this would be on up to six creatures, so 3d8+5. Well, everybody but one.
Laura: Everybody but Scanlan.
Matt: Sure, everybody but Scanlan, we'll put it there.
Ashley: 18.
Matt: Plus five?
Ashley: That's plus five.
Matt: Okay, so everyone heals 18 hit points.
Ashley: Rolled a little low.
Matt: That's all right. Okay, you're heading off--
Liam: I'm going to start moving through the entire place, I'm going to start at the front gate and see if anybody's outside.
Matt: As you head into the foyer, the first thing you see is Laina currently panicking about, running around with Erwin falling behind, trying to calm her down and going, "Laina, it's all right calm down." And Laina is like, "I don't know what to do, I, I--" She turns around and sees you, "Oh, Master, Master Vax."
Liam: It's actually not all right, we need to gather everyone right now, quickly, I'll explain after we've gotten everyone in the keep. We need to go to Percival's workshop, can you help me with that?
Matt: "We can do that, we have a problem--" She points out. The front of the keep is currently opened, the doors and the gate's there and you can hear what sounds like a cluster of very loud voices, shouting and screaming and yelling over each other.
Travis: Outside of the keep?
Liam: But I'm on my own, right?
Matt: You are, yeah.
Marisha: What are the voices speaking?
Matt: Are you following him to the foyer? Currently only Vax is.
Liam: Go to Percival's workshop, go, I will handle it.
Marisha: I figured we'd all be moving outside, at least.
Matt: All right, as you guys move into the foyer to follow, you see Vax having this conversation with Laina. She and Erwin go head back down, to head down to the workshop. What are you doing?
Liam: I'm going to go stealth toward the door to see what the hell is going on out there.
Matt: Okay. Roll stealth check.
Liam: Yeah, it's a 29.
Matt: All right, good to know. All right, so as you go to the door and look out, you can see, along the top wall there are three figures. Takes you a moment to focus, and you realize that it is Kendrick, who's one of your general guards you keep around, as well as Cordell and Shayne. All three of them have crossbows ready, and they're yelling to each other and aiming them over the wall towards the front. However, what you can hear from this point is a chorus of 20, 30 or more voices muffled from the other side of the wall.
Liam: I'm going to start running up towards them. I'm going to join them on the wall.
Matt: Okay, so there is a ladder at the side, and you climb up the ladder, and as you get closer, you hear people shouting, different voices going, "Let us in, let us in or we'll die!" Voices going, "What are you doing, you going to leave us out here?!" Other people are screaming, you hear crying children, you hear people shrieking.
Liam: How many people am I seeing down there?
Matt: Well, as you get up to the top and crest over, you can see the three guards are all yelling at each other and yelling over, "We can't, we can't do anything right now, we're waiting for th--" They look over and see you come over the edge, and you can see there's probably close to 50 or so people that are all pressed up against the gates to the inside of your keep, that are all shouting to be let in.
Liam: If I look past, do I see anyone else coming towards the keep? Is it just a cluster and that's it, or--
Matt: You can see people that are fleeing from the town in little bits, two or three at a time, trails of individuals that are just now managing to make it outside of the city of Emon itself. Some of them are heading out into the distance, getting far away as possible. A few more are heading towards the keep, and you gather that this crowd has been gathering here for the last few minutes, at the very least.
Liam: All right, slapping my hand on Kendrick's shoulder. We are going to let these people in. The city has come under attack, everything is fucked beyond belief. There are at least four large, old dragons attacking the city, and these people need to come inside. I don't know what we're going to do with them, but we're going to bring them in now. And you and I are going to wait by the gate for those stragglers to come in. The rest of you, take them inside, join the others.
Matt: They all look at each other. Cordell gives you a nod, "Right, sir, we'll open the gate, hold on." And you guys all, are you heading out to the courtyard as well? Or are you staying inside the keep?
Laura: Yeah, yeah, we see them.
Matt: So you come out and see this happening and hear them shouting at the top of the wall.
Marisha: Keyleth stands in the middle of the foyer, unable to move.
Taliesin: Keep them out of my workshop, but put them into the spare rooms and anywhere we have room.
Laura: Maybe the cathedral?
Taliesin: The cathedral is a great idea.
Matt: At this point, you hear this strange high-pitched whine sound. Vax, as you look up, you can see there are these columns of smoke that are billowing out of the city in the distance as mass areas are burning and smoldering. You see coming out of one of the clouds something spinning slowly towards you, and you look up and see it's one of the skyships from the Cloudtop District, one half of it currently in flames.
Laura: Inside, now!
Liam: I scream out, get the gates open now!
Matt: At which point, you can see now Shayne and Cordell are pulling on the ratchets, pulling the chains up as fast as they can while putting their eyes up and seeing this as it careens in your direction.
Taliesin: I'm running up to the tower as quickly as I can.
Liam: And I'm fireman's pole down the ladder, down one side of the ladder to get to the gate.
Matt: Okay. The gate opens a little bit, enough to get one or two people through, and begins to push through, and you can see now people are yelling in pain as they're being crushed, as the whole mass of them are pushing through the small opening.
Liam: I scream out  if you rush, you will die!
Matt: It doesn't seem to be affecting anybody, unfortunately. There's this inlaid fear, this animalistic need to survive.
Laura: I start to grab people arms and pulling them through and helping people get through safely.
Matt: At this point, the skyship has passed overhead, missing the top of the keep and the highest walls by about 40 or so feet. For a few seconds of silence, and you hear impact, shaking the ground for a few seconds. Not far from here, you can see another blast of red fire and a couple of sparks of arcane energy that arc out, as another column of smoke south of you begins to pour up into the sky.
Marisha: Feeling that, I snap out of it and run to the south exit of the castle to look for the explosion.
Matt: Okay. As you start rushing in that direction, to the south side of the castle, looking back to where the skyship came through, you can see the smoke parts once more, and you see unfurling from within two large white wings bearing down, and you can see as it swoops down, there are groups of people that are rushing 100, 200, 300 feet away, that are pulling themselves out of the ravine that sits between the south walls of Emon and the north walls of your keep. As they're pouring through the mud and the stream there, it's about four or five feet deep, it swoops down and unleashes a blast of freezing cold energy that freezes that whole section of the river solid and every person in that vicinity as well. Locked in place.
Marisha: Does Keyleth see all of this?
Matt: You don't see this because you're inside the wall. You see it come down and swoop by. You see it circle around. You, however, have a good view of this, right as you're about to go down the wall on the ladder.
Taliesin: Vex, I need you on the roof.
Laura: All right. I run up.
Matt: As you go running up, you guys see now it circles back around and its wings tilt to one side as it begins to make its way towards the keep for a second sweep. I would like everyone to roll initiative.
Travis: Yeah, we got to get down.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Travis: You want to go first?
Matt: Put you there. Percy and Vex, you guys are up on the wall, technically, right?
Taliesin: Up here, so we can get down real quick.
Matt: Okay, yeah, so the ladder is there.
Taliesin: Well, shouldn't there be a door that leads to that anyway?
Matt: The way this is designed is it's a ladder getting up and down.
Taliesin: Okay. That'll do.
Matt: Did you still go down the ladder, or are you staying up top here?
Liam: No, I already said I went down.
Matt: Okay, so as soon as you see it swoop overhead, you come back down to the bottom there. Scanlan is currently inside for the sake of this, and may come out here in a moment, he's figuring out what's going on. Grog, where are you?
Travis: I guess I was out in the courtyard, trying to help the cattle come in.
Matt: All right, so let's go ahead and place some cattle.
Laura: Jesus.
Travis: The door to get back inside is located where?
Laura: Yeah, where's the cathedral at? Is that what the other entry is?
Matt: This is the entrance to your actual keep, there. Essentially, these two sections here are the doors that lead through to the interior. People are pouring through at this point, trying to get through as fast as possible. Whole cluster of them.
Taliesin: Got to get that thing finished.
Laura: There's more on the outside there? Is that what you're putting there?
Matt: Pike, you are where?
Ashley: Yeah. Somewhere around there.
Matt: In the center, keeping watch there, all right, and Trinket is with you-- or Trinket can't make it up the ladder, so Trinket is staying in the courtyard, probably keeping close to Pike right there. All righty, so. Initiative. 25 to 20.
Liam: 24.
Marisha: 22.
Taliesin: 27. 26, 26.
Matt: What did you get, Keyleth?
Marisha: 22.
Matt: All right. Who got 20 to 15?
Laura: 15.
Matt: 15. Pike, what did you get?
Ashley: Three!
Matt: Three. Grog?
Travis: Nine.
Ashley: I can do some cleanup. (laughter)
Travis: Three!
Ashley: Matt, real quick.
Travis: He said 'yeah', you can go ahead.
Ashley: Oh, I think I do have a sixth level because I think that sixth level was used for Liam with the worm, and then we came back to the keep to rest.
Matt: That's right, that's correct, you do have a sixth level spell, still. Yes, thank you for the reminder. Good on you. All right, and so here we have Cordell, we have Shayne, and we have Kendrick right there on the top, as well. Top, currently the dragon is about, I'd say, 120 feet off this direction. You're up first, Percy.
Taliesin: Does it seem like the dragon has noticed us?
Matt: The dragon at the moment is currently seeing the keep. It doesn't notice anyone in particular, it just sees a swarm of people trying to get inside, and it's circling around to try and do another dive attack.
Taliesin: How dumb am I?
Matt: That's up to you, buddy.
Taliesin: Okay, cool.
Laura: Don't be real dumb because I'm standing next to you.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to pull out Bad News, and I'm going to make a targeted shot at its wings and try to put a hole into its wings.
Matt: Okay, go for it, go ahead and take the shot.
Travis: What the fuck. Come on, golden snitch.
Taliesin: Natural 20. (cheering)
Travis: Get the hell out of here.
Taliesin: I'm back, baby.
Matt: Go ahead and roll some damage on that.
Liam: A little, tiny ray of sunshine.
Matt: 4d12 for the hit on that, and then what's the save, to see if it can maintain height?
Taliesin: It's a constitution saving throw.
Matt: All right-- (laughs) It rolled a four.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: It is plus 14 to its constitution saving throw, so it's 18. What's the DC on that?
Taliesin: Eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod-- So, I don't know-- six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 18.
Matt: So it just makes the save.
Taliesin: Hold on, is that right? It's proficiency bonus.
Matt: Proficiency bonus plus four.
Taliesin: Plus dexterity, which is six.
Matt: Six, which is 18, and it just makes the save.
Taliesin: Stupid dragon.
Matt: Just makes its save, but still does damage, go ahead and roll that.
Travis: At least you hit it, you got to bleed it a bit. Longshot.
Taliesin: 27 points of damage. Let's see, one more, yeah, one more shot at the wings just to see if I can take it down. Make it.
Matt: Okay, the second attack is reload, third attack. Another grit point to try and take it down, go for it. Roll for the attack.
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: 25 hits. It rolled a three, that is 17.
Taliesin: (laughs) Drop, fucker!
Matt: Terrible, terrible-- All right, so that will effectively reduce its speed, or its height, by what?
Taliesin: Height by 20 feet? And I imagine that would throw it a bit.
Matt: It might.
Liam: Now it's angry.
Taliesin: And let's do some damage. And damage is 20 points of damage.
Matt: 20, nice. All right. 27 points of damage on the round.
Taliesin: I'm going to hold my movement until it's so close that I want-- I'm going to hold my movement until--
Matt: You can hold an action, you can't really hold movement.
Taliesin: Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus action to turn to Vex and: fight or flight? All right, you can answer next turn, yeah.
Matt: However, as the first bullet hits, you see it takes the hit in the wing, but it hits the muscle on the edge. As it goes into its glide to head down, you fire into the other wing, this time blowing a hole through the leather flap, and you can see it lose about 20 feet and is actually now skidding towards the roof of the keep.
Laura: Oh jeez.
Taliesin: That was a good plan?
Matt: Okay, that ends your turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm going to dive by that tree.
Matt: Right here?
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And I'm going to hold my attack until it is on the ground or low to the ground.
Matt: All right, got it. So you're holding your attack if you can. All right, cool. Keyleth.
Marisha: Where am I in regards to everyone else?
Matt: You are right here, because you were heading to the south wall when all this went down.
Marisha: Oh, okay.
Matt: This is the north direction this way. It came this way, swooped past, circled around, and now it's coming back from this direction.
Marisha: Okay. I want to use my movement to get under that tree.
Matt: Under this tree or that tree?
Marisha: Yeah, let me-- No, towards the entrance-- heading for cover.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Here.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so you're behind the tree.
Marisha: And now I'm going to cast Fog Cloud at fourth level, which makes it a radius of 80 feet.
Matt: 80-foot radius?
Marisha: If you cast it at higher levels, it goes up by 20 feet for each level higher you cast it. So I'm casting it at fourth level. Okay, so I go all Storm for a second, get all misty-eyed, and I want to create a nice low-level fog. Across the whole castle.
Matt: Okay. Okay, so heavily obscured. Heavily obscured will give everyone a 3/4 cover bonus-- Let me see what heavily obscured would actually do specifically, to be sure real fast, pardon me.
Travis: I don't even know what 3/4 cover bonus is.
Matt: It's when you're blocked by something, it gives you a bonus to--
Travis: Never happens to me. I'm usually a 3/4 cover bonus.
Matt: All right. It blocks vision entirely, creatures suffer from the blinded condition. So everyone in the entire Keep is now blinded.
Marisha: Well, I want to make it like a fog cloud over top, so we're blinded by--
Matt: So it's above you guys, is what you're saying?
Marisha: Yeah, so we're blocked from the dragon as we flee. I hope you guys weren't wanting to shoot at it, by the way.
Taliesin: Well, we're above it, the cloud would be between--
Matt: The cloud now is-- encompasses this whole area here. Which means the only people that are affected by it are the people at the top of this tower right now. Got it. Was that your turn? Your movement?
Marisha: That's it.
Matt: Cool, stay there?
Marisha: Well, I moved.
Matt: Right, you moved there. Are you done with your turn? Okay. So now it is the white dragon's turn. The white dragon, as it comes down, you don't see it anymore because the fog cloud obscures it, but you suddenly hear the sound of a heavy object slamming into stone, and the cracking and breaking of stone against the surface, as the dragon has now, due to the fall of height, slammed into the top of the Keep and is tearing its underside against the roof. Who knows the state that the roof of the Keep is going to be in right now, but because of that, I'm going to ahead and--
Laura: We'll just have Riskel fix it-- Oh, wait.
Matt: Well, he was the overseer. He actually had somebody else build the actual thing by hand.
Laura: Oh, okay. Well, good.
Matt: So it suffers 14 points of damage--
Laura: That's it?
Matt: Yeah. It's dragonhide, man.
Travis: What about all the spires that are up there, that have anti-dragon poison?
Matt: Yeah. That was a dream, unfortunately. However, it does somewhat emerge-- you can see its form somewhat as it comes down in this direction, ending its movement here.
Travis: Oh no.
Marisha: Wait, it skids to a halt right there?
Matt: It's just the fog cloud. As it slams into the keep and tumbles off the top of it and catches itself in the air (wingbeats).
Travis: How high above us is it?
Matt: It is currently 20 feet above you guys. For its turn, it is going to pick a random direction to try and blast its cold breath at. So let me go ahead and roll the direction on this.
Laura: Because it's all covered in fog?
Matt: Yeah, it can't see right now. Currently it's obscured. Oh, hold on! But it has blindsight 60 feet, so it has no effect on him, unfortunately. So as it stops in the air, it still manages to use its sense of smell and the general atmospheric ability to sense what's around it. It seem to move its head and search--
Liam: Can I attack right now? I was holding my attack.
Matt: You can. Now, what's the range on your daggers?
Liam: 60, because I'm Sharpshooter.
Matt: 30, 40, 50, 60-- it's just at the cusp. Like just barely cusp, but yeah, you can get your attack.
Liam: So I'm going before him, and it's a surprise attack because I'm hidden and I'm going first--
Matt: Yes, you're essentially interrupting his attack because the moment he came into range--
Liam: So it's an advantage and it is an automatic crit?
Matt: It's not a automatic crit, it's not surprised.
Liam: It's not surprised?
Matt: No, it know you guys are there.
Liam: Even hiding behind a tree? All right.
Matt: A surprise generally means that it has absolutely no idea that you are there or there's any sort of threat from you.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Liam: All right. And then the second dagger I throw-- I can only throw a second one-- is also a 24.
Matt: Both hit.
Liam: So the first one is double dice, so eight plus-- 14, 15, 18, 23, 25. Double dice is 50 plus seven is-- Yeah, 57 for the first.
Matt: Ooh, nice.
Liam: And the second one goes bink. That is a ten.
Matt: Ten, all right. 57 points of damage, that's-- Is that straight-up dice rolls? That's crazy.
Liam: That's Sneak Attack, I've gone up a level to 13--
Matt: Right, so it's a d6 or 7d6.
Liam: 7d6-- Oh, wait.
Matt: It's not doubled, though.
Liam: Sorry, sorry, sorry. 25 plus seven is 32. Sorry, 32.
Matt: 32, there you go, I was like, that's really high for a non-crit.
Liam: The second one was ten. 32, ten.
Matt: So 42 points of damage. Still not shabby by any means. Gotcha, as you chuck both daggers in the direction where you can see as it's now at the very bottom of the fog cloud. You have enough visual to strike towards it without missing and both daggers sink into the bottom of the creature. One of them you know was a nice, impactful wounding for any other creature, but it doesn't seem to have taken much issue with the impact of the blade. Appear at your side again. That ends your reaction. Now Vorugal is going to go. Looking at the area of most density--
Liam: What was his name again?
Matt: Ah, you will know that shortly. The white dragon. The white dragon rears up in the fog cloud and dips down a little bit, (exhales) outside of the fog cloud, hitting everyone in this vicinity here. That's going to be Grog, Trinket, and everyone here over. I would like all of you to make a constitution saving throw. Well, I'm not going to roll that many dice, I'm going to use my dice roller.
Ashley: Come on, guys.
Marisha: "I'm not going to roll that many dice." Always a good sign.
Liam: Grog's about to lose ten percent of his hit points.
Matt: I don't have enough d6s, it's 16d6. Or sorry, 16d8, my apologies. All right, so that comes to-- Grog, what's your--
Travis: 25.
Matt: 25, that's a success. What's Trinket's?
Laura: 15.
Matt: 15? All right, that is 63 points of cold damage to Trinket.
Laura: Trinket is unconscious.
Matt: All right. Trinket actually freezes in place. Now you can see the armor itself has about an inch-thick layer of ice as currently the eyes go dull as unconsciousness takes the bear, but unable to show or reveal that. Grog, you take half that, so you are at-- you take 32 points of cold damage. Let me roll some saves here. Average saves-- Okay, so these four here survive, the rest of these are all entirely wiped out. And you can see now, the people that were rushing in are now rushing away from the keep. The rest are getting the fuck out of Dodge. So yeah, that's going to be the end of the white dragon's turn. That brings us to Vex. You're up in the fog cloud right now, so you have no visual range on the creature. You hear all these screams and hear the blast.
Laura: I can't see it?
Matt: No, unfortunately, the fog cloud is just high enough where it covers this area for you guys. However, you could jump off if you wanted to, make an acrobatics roll and then maybe do your attack afterwards. If you wanted to try that, your call.
Laura: Wouldn't I still be in the fog cloud if I was on the ground?
Matt: No, the fog cloud is elevated up here. It starts here and then goes upward. Keyleth created it in the air. You guys are at the base of it right now.
Laura: So I can use my movement to jump down?
Matt: Yes, if you want to.
Laura: All right, I'm going to fucking Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: You can't see him right now, unfortunately.
Laura: I'm going to jump fucking down on the ground.
Matt: So you jump. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. As you leap off the highest part of the wall of your Keep, all of a sudden the fog dissipates and you see the ground rushing up towards you.
Laura: 14.
Matt: 14. You manage to catch yourself. You aren't knocked prone, but you do suffer five points of damage from the fall. But you catch yourself (grunts), get up, and now you can see at the very, very base of the fog cloud, the head peeking though and the wings occasionally (wingbeats) from out underneath, and you have visual on the dragon.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. And I'm going to shoot him through the Sky Sentinel.
Matt: You already used the Sky Sentinel if I recall against the green dragon, didn't you?
Laura: On the worm.
Matt: Was it the worm? Okay.
Laura: And I multiclassed today, so I'm a rogue, so I get Sneak Attack on this.
Matt: It currently does not have--
Laura: Does it know that-- does it see me?
Matt: You haven't tried to stealth, so technically yes. As soon as you jumped off and land, and hurt yourself and your ankle, you look up and it sees you.
Laura: Never fucking mind. Balls, all kind of balls around here right now. The first attack is 25.
Matt: 25 hits.
Laura: The second attack is 24.
Matt: Both hit.
Laura: The third attack is 16.
Matt: 16 misses.
Laura: Okay, so. Let me double-check. An extra d6 for those two. 15 plus seven is what?
Liam: 15 plus seven is 22.
Laura: 22 on the first arrow. 15 plus four is 19 on the second arrow. I'm a little upset right now. And then I'm going to shoot the third arrow through the Blazing Bowstring. I mean my second attack.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And that doesn't hit him, so. Good times.
Matt: So as you land, you get up, pull out your arrow, and as you pull back and release it, you can see it bursts into arcane energy and splits into three different arrows, two slamming into the fog cloud and hitting the sides of the dragon, and it's knocked around for a second. It looks around and its eyes peer at you-- You did the additional Hunter's Mark damage on it, right?
Laura: I did.
Matt: Cool. You see now it's looking around, choosing what its next round is going to be about, and you seem like a tasty morsel, though not entirely drawn to its attention at the moment. You still have a little bit of movement if you wanted to move.
Laura: Can I-- No.
Taliesin: Just for clarification  which door is back into the keep? That one. Okay.
Laura: Is it possible to get inside the door?
Matt: Inside of--
Laura: The door that I'm right there-- If I backed up into the door?
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you could. We'll say you're inside right now. You hide inside the best you can to keep out of view.
Laura: Yeah, I want to be ducked around a wall, if I can, on the inside of the door.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All right, so, at that point now, your guards over here don't have-- they can't see at all, but they saw you jump off the side. Kendrick is going to go ahead and take the ladder down, and it's going to be his movement to land there. They're both going to jump and make your-- using your example. Cordell, not bad, and Shayne-- actually, both rolled pretty well. Both managed to prevent any fall damage, catching themselves on the ground with their heavy crossbows ready. They rush up and fire both at the dragon. Five and a one, god damn-- That hits, and a 19. All right, so Cordell and Shayne both manage to get one shot that hits the dragon on both sides. So both bolts hit, so that's seven damage and ten damage, so 17 damage total from them, as they fire the heavy crossbow, try and reload it and get off a second shot. That ends their turn, now. That brings us to Grog's turn.
Travis: I would like to rage.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And run at Trinket.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: He's covered in how much ice?
Matt: About an inch, inch and a half of ice, and the rest of the entities, all the rest of the people that died, they all got frozen in place and some of them shattered in the impact and there's chunks of them frozen on the ground.
Liam: Is that a medicine check at this point? If Trinket is frozen in ice? You can't say--
Matt: You have no idea.
Liam: Thanks. Could I pee on him and thaw him out, quickly?
Matt: Over time, yeah. You'll have to drink a lot beforehand and wait a little while, jog in place. What you got, Grog?
Travis: I would like to run to the side that is closest to you, on Trinket. I would like to start pushing him along the lawn, towards the entrance to the Keep, like a giant ice block.
Matt: Okay, so this side there. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Because you are raging, you have advantage on strength checks.
Travis: Yes, thank god. 18.
Matt: 18, okay. You did suffer damage this turn, but you started raging this turn, so if you don't suffer damage until the beginning of next turn, your rage ends and you'll have to rage again. Just a heads up. But with that roll, though, you managed to push him, we'll say 15 feet that direction. (grunts) Pushing a giant frozen bear and he's sliding against the grass in the front of the courtyard. Sweat's beginning to pop on your brow as your teeth are gritted, and looking over your shoulder, you can still hear the snapping and the-- The air itself of the entire courtyard has dropped about 20 degrees, and you can begin to see your breath in the vicinity of this creature. That ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Scanlan now steps out from the inside of the Keep, because Sam is texting me what he wants to do. He rushes out at this point. Seeing all of this from the inside, he whips out his Wand of Fireballs and aims it up at the bottom of the dragon that is now visible underneath. As you see now, the edge of the wand flickers red for a second, before a little bead of light streaks forward and (explosion) detonates beneath it. The dragon would fail its saving throw, but it's going to use its Legendary Resistance once to auto-save, so it takes half damage. He is going to use-- What did he tell me, how many slots he wanted to do? Okay, so he's going to use three of its charges to do this one, that will put it at--
Laura: What is he doing?
Liam: He's trying to resist. Scanlan sent a Fireball at it and it's fucking with it.
Matt: 36 damage halved from him, so that still puts it at 17 points of fire damage to it, not too shabby. As it blasts out from the opposite side of it through the bottom of the cloud, keeping everyone else outside of the collateral damage radius of the Fireball because of its height, so that's good. Scanlan then, realizing the circumstances, uses the rest of his movement to get back into the very corner of the Keep and defend himself against the wall. That's going to end Scanlan's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: All right, I'm-- Can I run over to where Trinket is? Okay. I'm going to Cure Wounds on him.
Matt: Okay. So you move over to Trinket. All right, go ahead and cast Cure Wounds.
Ashley: Okay, I'm going to cast it at 4th-level.
Matt: 4th-level, okay. 4d8 plus five.
Travis: On the floor.
Ashley: Dang! 30.
Matt: 30. Trinket heals up-- As Pike reaches out, grasping her symbol in one hand, a look of desperation in her face, her hand goes out and touches the ice and as her hand touches, her fingers melt through through the ice with divine energy in her fingertips, and manages to touch Trinket's fur beneath. As the divine energy filters through her body, Trinket's form glows from the inside and the ice begins to crack before it all shatters off of Trinket's body and Trinket catches himself (bear grunts) and shakes off what little bit of remaining ice and moisture is on the coat.
Laura: Thank you guys.
Ashley: I want to scratch behind his ears.
Matt: Okay. Trinket goes (bear noises) Trinket nudges you and licks your face before looking up and growling very angrily at the dragon.
Laura: I don't think Vex even saw any of that, like Vex doesn't even know he was unconscious.
Liam: Got to go Revenant on that bear!
Matt: That is an angry bear, and those who have seen the movie know how scary an angry bear is. Great. Pike, you still have a little bit of movement, if you want to move. You have like 15 more feet, if you wanted to use that, your call.
Ashley: Okay, you guys are my eyes, so I can't really see it from here. But I guess anywhere there's cover. Is that a tree?
Matt: You can start moving towards the tree or the front of the keep, tree is closer but currently has two other people hiding there.
Liam: Or behind the goliath.
Ashley: What was that?
Liam: Behind the goliath.
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: All right, you move over here and use Grog as cover, we'll say, and leap over there. Classic Pike-Grog technique. (laughter)
Matt: Cool. Ends your turn. The rest of these survivors on this side of the wall are going to start fleeing in this direction, using their turn to get the hell out. These guys here are going to do a full-round dash to get inside the keep, and they manage to make it inside. These guys here are moving back. Actually, no, these guys now that are inside the keep are going to run, they get almost all the way to the keep. There we go. The dwarf gets about that far, this guy almost makes it in. They're all right at the cusp of getting into the keep, screaming and running past you, moving between the different frozen bodies, not even paying attention to any of you, as the look of sheer terror on their faces has taken over. That brings us to the top of the round. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to drop down-- Like a boss.
Matt: Are you going to leap or climb down?
Taliesin: I'm going to leap.
Matt: All right, and roll.
Taliesin: 29.
Matt: 29, success and managed to avoid one of your guards who was right below you. You weren't aware and managed to dodge off to the side this way and use the edge of the wall to kick off to change the trajectory, as you land, carrying Bad News in one hand, three-point landing in the other.
Laura: Sick, Percy.
Liam: Hold that gun up from the ground.
Matt: Yep. Just making sure it doesn't damage itself.
Taliesin: Okay, the next thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to concentrate really hard and I'm going to try and conjure Hex to see if it works.
Matt: Okay. So as you focus and look up, you can see now some of the fog cloud that surrounds it congeals into a darker color and clings to the dragon's form as it is now Hexed by you.
Taliesin: It still works.
Matt: Is seems that as long as the shadow entity has been within you, though it is no longer bound to your weapon and yourself, it did leave some dark scars on your soul.
Liam: Left a taint upon you. (laughter)
Taliesin: So, just to remind you, that means that he has disadvantage on all agility checks.
Matt: Are you choosing dexterity? Because you choose which one of the--
Taliesin: Oh, on which checks? Constitution.
Matt: Constitution, all right. So I'll put that down.
Laura: I like it, I like it.
Matt: I'm not sure that's how it works here. Someone will yell it later.
Taliesin: Ability check, on any ability checks.
Matt: On ability checks, yes. Good to know.
Taliesin: I'm going to spend a grit point. I'm going to take another shot to try and drop him.
Matt: Even further?
Taliesin: Yeah. Just for fun.
Matt: Because saving throws are-- I don't--
Taliesin: Are they not? Because I'll use that Grit point for something else, if--
Matt: I don't believe saves are ability checks, unfortunately, so that wouldn't affect that. Yeah, it is its own circumstance.
Taliesin: It's its own circumstance? In that case, I'm going to spend my point for Deadeye.
Matt: Okay. Advantage on the shot.
Taliesin: Advantage on the shot.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: And do I want to go nuts? I'm going to go nuts. I'm going to add Sharpshooter to that, might as well.
Matt: You cannot overlap the shots. No, only one shot effect on an attack at a time, sorry.
Taliesin: That's fine, here we go.
Travis: Come on, go nuts.
Taliesin: Both-- 25.
Matt: 25 hits.
Taliesin: 2d12.
Matt: And add your 1d6 damage as well.
Taliesin: Oh, thank you for reminding me-- 17 points of damage plus four points of necrotic damage.
Matt: Nice. 21 damage total.
Taliesin: I'm going to use the rest of my movement to duck in there. I want to try and spin all the way back so I'm completely out of sight. Is that door open?
Matt: There's a little space there, I mean.
Taliesin: Open the door.
Marisha: Does that lead to our keep?
Taliesin: No, it's the other door that leads to our keep. So we're both going to get in and dual-wall it.
Laura: Yeah!
Taliesin: And then I'm going to use my bonus action to take one of my few remaining potions. The medium one.
Laura: Does the door actually open on it?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Heh, that's so cool.
Taliesin: What does the mid-range potion do? I should really start writing this down. Is it one--
Travis: Mid-range potion?
Taliesin: The second-level potion.
Matt: Of healing, you mean? That is--
Liam: 10d10.
Matt: Not so much. Second level, greater healing is 4d4 plus four.
Taliesin: 4d4 plus four.
Matt: You got it. All right, cool. That ends Percy's turn, Vax, you're up.
Liam: I want to double check, the boots of speed that I wear, it's ten rounds each day, the haste effect's duration need not be consecutive rounds. So it was one or two back in Emon, and I've had one round here.
Matt: That's the old Pathfinder rules.
Liam: So what is it, ten minutes now? I think it remember the ten-minute thing--
Matt: No. Haste lasts for a minute, you get to use the spell on you once. Yeah. In this ruleset, it's a little too much.
Liam: All right, so, I'm going to dash towards the tree in that corner and get away from this clump of my friends.
Matt: Over this way?
Liam: Towards the wall, yeah. I should be able to get behind that tree, I think, if I dash?
Matt: If you dash, yeah. Yeah, you can get over there, behind that way.
Liam: So then I'm going to throw a dagger, it's all I can do. Can I use an action to hide? Or it's a bonus action only?
Matt: As you throw it, the arc just misses the bottom, what's the maximum range on the dagger, right?
Liam: Whoa, I'm asking if instead of throwing a dagger, can I hide instead?
Matt: You could, yeah.
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
Matt: Yeah, because right now, it's at 60 feet away, but it's at an upward angle from you, which adds a little more distance, your dagger would miss it at this range, and you would know that.
Liam: So I'm running balls-out to that tree, and I'm going to go right up against the tree. And fucking wait and that's it.
Matt: Cool. All right, did you roll stealth?
Liam: Oh, sure. I'm going to use Luck, I still have a little Luck today, good, that's better. 31.
Matt: 31. Good, good, good-- Okay, that ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Oh god. Okay, I'm afraid of everything-- I'm afraid if I throw up a Wall of Stone or anything like that, he'll be able to be like, oh, I'm a fucking dragon, so I'll go to the other side of the wall. Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to start running towards the keep. Start running towards the keep. I'm going to go ahead and cast Conjure Woodland Beings. And I'm going to summon a giant eagle.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: This is dropping my Fog Cloud, since that was real fucking useful.
Matt: So, where are you conjuring it?
Marisha: I'm gonna conjure it right on the other side of him where it's-- I can then have it do an attack, correct? In the same turn?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I command it to go for its eyeballs.
Liam: Eagle to the fucking face.
Taliesin: Eagle to the eye!
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Oh, that's inauspicious.
Matt: All right, so as the eagle goes up. Do you have stats for the eagle?
Laura: That eagle is weally weally close to that dwagon.
Marisha: Oh right, he's attacking, right, right. He has talons.
Matt: You've got to roll for damage on that.
Marisha: That was more of a distraction.
Matt: Which spell is this? Conjure--
Marisha: Conjure Woodland Beings.
Matt: Conjure Woodland Beings.
Marisha: It's a 4th-level spell.
Matt: 4th-level spell, thank you. All right, great.
Marisha: It was a 19-- Oh wait, plus five is 21.
Matt: I have to roll initiative for it separately as part of the spell. It rolled a 20.
Marisha: It rolled a 20?
Matt: All right, so I'll say given that case I'll let it go ahead and go immediately, but next turn it starts at 20.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: That is pretty close to what you got.
Marisha: It rolled a 21 on its attack.
Matt: 21? Hits! Actually. (cheering)
Marisha: Go, eagle, go! Right in the eyes.
Travis: Just barely hits or hits?
Matt: It's close to barely hitting him.
Marisha: Yeah! 2d-- So that's 11 plus three-- 14 points of damage.
Matt: 14 points of damage. As the eagle starts clawing at it, you can see the dragon rears back, unexpected to see the sudden giant eagle appear out of the middle of the air and go clawing at its face. You can see it rears back as it does so, moving its head out of the way. Gets a couple of scratches in, but still an ancient dragon. It's more spooked than really hurting from the impact, but it caught it off guard.
Marisha: It's supposed to be a distraction, all right-- And then I use a bonus action to be like: everyone inside!
Matt: All right, that's your turn? Now it is the white dragon's turn. Let's see if its breath weapon returns. Nope, it rolled a one. So instead, it's going to ignore the eagle.
Marisha: Great.
Matt: As instead it lands right about there.
Travis: It lands?
Matt: It lands (impact). As it impacts, the whole ground shakes around you. As you were pushing Trinket, you look over your shoulders, the shadow encompasses the area, and as you look over, you see it land with a heavy impact. Giant frozen gnashing teeth as mist emanates from the side of its jaws. It's going to use its multiattack, including its Frightful Presence. I need everybody, everybody to roll a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: Including us inside?
Matt: Yep. As it rears back and gives off a horrible roar that shakes the stones of the actual keep.
Marisha: 23.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 18.
Travis: 18.
Taliesin: Seven.
Laura: Eight for me.
Matt: Oh, Scanlan rolled a 19.
Laura: And 19 for Trinket.
Taliesin: Actually, I'm going to spend my resolve and reroll that.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Okay, everyone who rolled an 18 or lower, it shakes you to your core. You suddenly really realize what you are dealing with here and the fear causes you to fight with the fight or flight impulse in your body. You are considered frightened.
Liam: Too late for Luck? (laughs) I got one more charge.
Travis: I can't be charmed or frightened.
Matt: Yeah, you're still raging so it doesn't affect you.
Liam: Nope, nope.
Matt: Nope. Okay. While you are frightened, you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while it's in your line of sight.
Laura: Man, I wish we would've a Fancy Feast.
Matt: And you cannot move closer to it willingly. You can only move away from it.
Liam: So attack rolls and what was the other?
Matt: Ability checks. While you can see it. You're so scared of this thing.
Laura: What is it really called?
Marisha: Heroes' Feast.
Laura: Fancy Feast is way better.
Matt: Lower level, but helpful.
Liam: (singing) I like chicken, I like liver, Meow Mix, Meow Mix, please deliver.
Travis: In the middle of white death.
Matt: It's going to make a bite attack against Pike and two claw attacks against Grog, who are right there. So Pike, you look up as its jaws come down at you from above. That's a natural 20.
Travis: Oh fuck, shit.
Matt: Against you, Grog, two claw attacks, that is 23.
Travis: Come on, taint-smear.
Matt: And 22.
Travis: Tickles, both of them.
Matt: Okay, so against you, Grog, you take--
Laura: Wait, that was against Grog?
Matt: The bite was against Pike. Two claws against you. So Grog, you take 15 points of slashing damage, reduced to half because you are raging. So, eight. And the other claw, that's a little higher, that is going to be 18 points of slashing damage. So down to nine.
Laura: So wait, so Pike was the one that took those huge hits?
Matt: The critical bite.
Laura: (gasps) Are you okay, Pike?
Ashley: I don't know. (singing) Critical bite!
Liam: What's Pike's AC? What's Pike's AC?
Matt: 20, but it rolled a critical hit. So that's--
Liam: Ooh, what's that face?
Taliesin: Don't do that!
Matt: So 17 times two. 34 plus eight. 42 points of piercing damage.
Ashley: Okay, okay, okay.
Matt: However, you then also suffer, as the freezing jaws clench around you and the cold surrounds you, you suffer an additional, that was 42 right?
Liam: I think you just said 'two', you just said 'two.'
Matt: Nah. Nine plus-- 13 points of cold damage. So 55 points of damage total.
Travis: Where you at, Pike?
Laura: Are you okay?
Ashley: I am at, hold on--
Liam: Carry the one. Carry the three.
Ashley: Hold on, one second.
Matt: Doing math here.
Laura: "One second, let me check."
Ashley: Okay, I'm at 25. Could be worse, could be worse.
Matt: That ends its turn.
Travis: Are we really fighting this thing or are we running?
Marisha: That what I was about to ask. Are we fighting or are we running?
Travis: We are getting our fucking asses handed to us.
Laura: Is it ancient?
Travis: He keeps saying ancient. So it's ancient.
Matt: That brings us to Vex's turn.
Laura: My turn? I'm feared.
Matt: Yeah, so you can attack it but you can't move closer to it and have disadvantage on all your attacks.
Taliesin: What can we do to unfear?
Matt: You repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns. Or it lasts for a minute.
Laura: Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus round to hide. Stealth.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Laura: 23. We're stuck where we are because we can't run closer to it.
Travis: You can run away from it.
Matt: You have disadvantage on the stealth check, by the way.
Laura: I did, and it was 23.
Matt: 23, gotcha.
Marisha: Who's not feared?
Laura: Oh! It's disadvantage, but I had advantage.
Matt: So it's just a straight roll.
Laura: Even. I don't remember what the first--
Liam: I wasn't paying attention.
Laura: Should I reroll it?
Matt: We'll take the 23, it's fine. Okay. You're inside and you know it's outside and you heard the roar and shaking and so you can peek around the corner but you cannot move out of the building. You can basically strafe to the side to get a look out as you want to, if you want to fire on it.
Laura: Okay, I guess I'll try to shoot it, then.
Matt: Okay, go for it. So disadvantage on both your attacks.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Trinket shrugged it off, Trinket is like, "Whatever, I got this."
Laura: Oh okay so-- That was good, that was good, 26. With disadvantage. Okay, so I'll do the first one right now.
Marisha: If we're running, I don't want to bust out my good shit.
Travis: We've got to run, right? I think it's stupid if we stay.
Liam: But where do we go? If we're outdoors, we're dead.
Marisha: We can go down-- inside, anyways.
Liam: And go where?
Travis: I don't know where, can he get inside the keep?
Liam: Sure, he can dig--
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Laura: Because I got Sneak Attack, right, because I'm hiding?
Matt: Yes, because you are technically hiding and it didn't roll high enough perception.
Laura: Okay, so 23 was the damage on the first arrow.
Matt: All right, was that including the sneak attack d6?
Liam: I don't know where to go. We can't go above ground because we're dead.
Laura: Now, the second one I don't think hits, it was like an 18.
Matt: Nope, that misses. So the first one, you fire and it manages to hit the creature because it does not see you. It hits to the side of its neck and looks over. It goes--
Laura: I duck back behind the wall.
Matt: Okay, behind the wall. You do reveal yourself as part of the strike, and it does see you duck inside and growls.
Laura: Okay, and I want to send Trinket into the keep, if he can make it.
Matt: Trinket is going to rush this way.
Laura: Is that, should I send Trinket into the keep?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: It gets an attack of opportunity against Trinket.
Laura: Balls, what? Really?
Taliesin: But it's holding Pike, so it has no bite.
Matt: Well, no, it didn't grapple her, it just bit her and released. She managed to get her way out of its mouth. That's going to be a 26 to hit.
Laura: Ah Jesus, it hits, come on.
Matt: All right, so Trinket takes 14 points of slashing damage.
Laura: All right.
Travis: Is he good?
Laura: He's fine. Bear-ly.
Matt: Oh, what! I see what you did. Does that end your turn?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Did you do a saving throw?
Matt: Do your saving throw, to see if you shrug off the frightened ability.
Laura: Okay, so is it wisdom?
Matt: It's wisdom-based, yeah.
Laura: Ooh, 17, 18, 19!
Matt: 19 is just what you need, you managed to shake off the fright from this. Seeing Trinket rush off, you're like, "Okay, I can do this." At the end of your turn, the white dragon is going to use--
Laura: I'm not afraid anymore, you hear that?
Matt: It's going to go ahead and use two of its actions to do a wing attack.
Liam: Shit.
Matt: So every creature within 15 feet of it, as it's sitting there, beats its wings around it and kicks up all this cold wind and air that blasts out, threatening to knock you off your feet. This is going to affect Grog, Pike, and Shayne. So I need you guys to make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Pike, get out of there!
Matt: Dexterity saving throw.
Ashley: I'm trying, I'm trying.
Travis: I have advantage on those. Because of Danger Sense.
Ashley: Ah! Natural 20.
Travis: Natural 20! (cheering)
Ashley: I don't have any dexterity modifier.
Matt: Cool. So-- All right, so yeah. I'll see if Shayne-- Shayne does not make it with a two, so Shayne takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. As she is rushing up, she's dropped her heavy crossbow and she's pulling a weapon out, and she rushes up, yelling, her red hair blown back from the wind as it's beating towards her. She gets bludgeoned with the sheer force of the wind from under the wings and knocked flat on her back. At the end of that attack, it now gets to move half its movement and so it-- There we go, a fly speed of 80, it's going to move 40 feet. So that will put it at 20 up this way as it starts backing away. And it's going to move 20 feet in this direction.
Travis: I get an attack of opportunity on it, right?
Matt: As it pulls away from you, yes you do.
Laura: Pike gets one, too.
Matt: No, actually, neither of you-- no, Grog is the only that does, because Pike, you're too far away, and it has reach on its attacks, so it doesn't have to be right up against you to hit you. But you still have to be up against it to get an attack.
Travis: 22. Does that hit?
Matt: That hits, yeah.
Travis: Okay. This is with Craven Edge, five, six.
Laura: Kill him. Kill him with Craven Edge!
Travis: 19 points of damage.
Matt: 19 points of damage, got it. All right, and has to make its constitution save
Laura: Disadvantage.
Matt: Not on saving throws. 24. Resist it? All right, cool.
Travis: You fucking piece of shit.
Matt: (laughs) So that ends Vex's turn, the guards now. Shayne will get up and she's now going to regret dropping her crossbow and go over and pick it up again; she's not going to have time to fire it. The other two, down here, are going to be-- Cordell is going to turn around and fire off a shot, as well as Kendrick. That's a natural one. That does hit, that does not, and that does not. One hit gets through, rolling ones like crap. That's five points of piercing damage, not great on that round, guards. Then they're going to start rushing towards the keep here, using the rest of their movement. Cordell is going to start moving to the side and start ushering everybody inside. "Go in, go in, go in." Shayne is going to move up next to you, Grog, and essentially begin to hold the flank with you. Shoulder to shoulder, she, as opposed to the crossbow at this point, and seeing the two of you can work together in this regard, she pulls out a broadsword. That's going to end the guards' turn, Grog, you're up.
Travis: Fuck this dragon. As much as I would love to protect this house, we've got to get the fuck out of here. Is Pike right behind me?
Matt: Pike is, yes.
Travis: Can I grab her and run inside the keep?
Matt: If Pike will allow it. Are you going to let Grog do that or are you going to fight him on it?
Ashley: No, no, no.
Travis: No, no, no, I can't do it?
Ashley: No, no, no, grab me and let's go.
Matt: You reach over and grab Pike, lift her up, and the two of you go bolting towards the keep.
Ashley: Grog!
Matt: That'll get you right here in the crowd.
Laura: Oh jeez, don't attack the crowd.
Travis: 50 feet?
Matt: 50 feet, but you're also having to push through people, so you're getting up, we'll say--
Travis: Little meat sticks, it's not a problem.
Matt: We'll say as you're pushing through here, you get up to the door. You guys are right up there with the full movement.
Travis: I'll even damage them, I don't give a shit.
Matt: There you go, that's your turn. The action was to pick her up. Okay.
Travis: Get out of the way, giant beast coming through.
Matt: Scanlan, at the back, seeing you guys rushing in, and he's happy to see Pike coming into safety at this point. He pulls out his wand again and aims once more with the Fireball.
Travis: The dragon giggles.
Marisha: Tickles.
Taliesin: Technically, fire damage should be good.
Matt: Fire damage doesn't do anything additional to it.
Travis: Don't say it smug like that. Jeez. It's our lives!
Matt: 29 damage, makes the save, so 15 points of fire damage to it as it blasts from underneath, singes the edge of one of the trees, but the white dragon appears to still be not really visibly hurting yet.
Travis: Yep, got to go. Got to go. Got to go.
Matt: Scanlan backs up into the keep, at this realization. At that point, nothing is right in range. So yeah, so the white dragon is not going to do anything. At this point in time--
Travis: Nope.
Matt: You guys hear a voice come ringing out from the north side, towards where Emon is. A familiar voice that you've heard before that shouts out, "Enough! You are not to linger, follow the others." At which point, you see the white dragon glances over the shoulder, and you hear the voice again say, "Vorugal!" And a streak of smoke and red. The red dragon you saw that had perched itself in the center of the city grapples onto the back of Vorugal and throws the dragon off the edge of the wall. And goes tumbling to the south of the keep. Out from the perspective.
Laura: So how much bigger is Vorugal, like is he--?
Matt: Yeah, he's roughly double the size of the white dragon.
Laura: Holy crap!
Marisha: Is this Umbrasyl? Does he refer himself as Umbrasyl?
Matt: No, you haven't heard the name of this one, until that point. Well, I mentioned it earlier.
Marisha: No, the red dragon.
Matt: The red dragon you haven't heard the name of yet. Umbrasyl is the black dragon. Raishan was the green dragon. So as you hear the impact, you hear the dragon screeching out in anger and no one has any visual at this point, you just hear the sounds over the side. You hear it skid to a halt, but the red dragon is still flying and grabs it, throws it, makes it hit the ground, almost like a show of dominance. And as it arcs back around, it ignores the keep and heads back towards Emon. You see Vorugal now lifting back up into the sky, staring back at the red dragon as it heads back, and you can see in its general demeanor, it's frustrated and angry and it begrudgingly begins to fly towards the east, where you saw the other two dragons continue. As the red dragon returns towards the city, its voice is ringing out at a volume that, even at this distance, is being enhanced by some sort of arcane means, whether it means-- it wants to be heard. And as you can see now, as it hits over the far south walls of Emon, it shouts out once more, "Hear me, insects! You that live do so out of mercy. Fight or flee and you forfeit that mercy. Know that your pitiful guardians brought this upon you. That blood is on their hands! Vengeance has been swift, and in its wake, a new age is upon you." Making its way towards the center of the city. "Be thankful, for until now your lives had no purpose. No meaning. Abandon your gods, your paltry convictions, for now you have a new purpose: to serve me!" And with that, you hear the clattering impact once more of the Cloudtop District, as a half-dozen buildings collapse under its weight as it slams into the center of what probably still stood tall in the middle of the city of Emon. You hear the crumbling wreckage echoing in the distance as it slides to a halt. And a couple of distant slamming sounds as it makes its way into the central borough where the palace once was. Quiet now takes the air, as all the people are still standing frozen in fright of what they just saw, and slowly begin making their way into the keep, whispering, shaking, crying under their breaths, the survivors that are not frozen in the center of Greyskull Keep's courtyard. What do you want to do?
Travis: Pee. (laughter)
Matt: That is entirely viable.
Liam: Everyone, we need to go inside.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Is this because of us?
Laura: Can we heal the frozen people? Is it possible?
Matt: You guys make you way out towards the people currently frozen in the courtyard-- What? Did you want to use Cure Wounds?
Laura: Yeah, sure.
Matt: Okay. You use what level?
Laura: Two.
Matt: Two, all right.
Liam: How many people are frozen?
Matt: Currently, I'd say about 14 people are frozen in the courtyard.
Liam: Can we all do medicine checks on them?
Matt: Six of them are partially shattered, like as part of the impact their bodies (shattering ice) and part of the torso busted, arms missing, upper body's missing. As you cast your 2nd-level Cure Wounds spell and reach out and touch the person to heal them, a crack forms where your hand touched the body and (shattering ice) before the upper part of their torso, head, and leg breaks into ice, and you get the feeling looking around that these individuals are beyond saving at this point.
Marisha: It's too long, it's too late.
Liam: Inside, everyone inside now.
Travis: Yeah, we all go inside.
Liam: Come along.
Matt: All right, so. You guys make your way inside the keep. People are looking about, some people are running through rooms trying to find a place to keep safe. You can see already in the armory there's like a family in there that are huddling, crouched in the corner. Some people have moved on towards the kitchen, people are shouting trying to see if anybody they lost eye contact with is inside, you hear a couple of people shouting names. "Shawn! Shawn!" "Kayla!" Different names being shouted as if they're hoping that someone they got separated from may have made it in. Couple do, a few seem to continue to shout fruitlessly. But the inside energy of the keep is one of tension, fear, and mounting sadness.
Laura: Can I find Erwen?
Matt: You can, you told the people within the keep to go downstairs
Laura: Yeah, I go and find him and tell him to start setting up as many beds as he can, as many in the cathedral that we have to-- In the chapel. To maybe give some of these people places to stay for the time being.
Matt: All right, so.
Ashley: Can I go into the temple?
Matt: You can. As you head downstairs too, you can see Jarett is still there, sitting with his crossbow on his lap, and he's been doing his last duty, which was to watch over your workshop. And as you come down the stairs, he goes, "What's going on, I heard noises upstairs, is everyone all right?"
Taliesin: No.
Laura: Everything's gone.
Matt: "May I be excused to aid Erwen in his duty?"
Laura: Please do.
Matt: "All right." He gets up and puts his crossbow away, heads upstairs, finds Erwen and Laina's still shaking, she goes, "If we're having guests, should I make food? I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do."
Laura: Simple food. Fruit, anything.
Matt: "Okay, I'll go ahead and start preparing it."
Travis: Percy. Can I have a word with you, please?
Taliesin: I step inside my workshop.
Travis: May I come in?
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Travis: Can you shut the door?
Taliesin: Is there anywhere private in this place at this point?
Laura: Nobody is in the workshop yet.
Matt: Nobody is in the basement or workshop area. Everyone is seemingly scattered on the base floor of the keep.
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: Can you lock it?
Taliesin: All right?
Travis: Listen, the skull we took out of the house. I haven't told you, but it grants a wish and only those that dark things have touched can use it. That's you and that's me, as far as I know. It said it wanted you, but I wasn't going to let him have you. It grants a wish. We can change all of this. I feel like it was there in case the dragons came out of that portal. It was facing the inside of the room, it moves, and there's something in there. I feel like it's a weapon. What the fuck else are we going to do? We go for more help, it'll get killed coming into this city. We're not strong enough to take four of these fucks.
Taliesin: We have an opportunity here, but we're going to have to be careful.
Travis: I'm listening.
Taliesin: All right. We're going to need more than just you, we are going to need a few of the others, just in case.
Travis: They have to be touched.
Taliesin: This is how it's going to work. I'm going to take it out, I'm going to have you go, I'm going to remove it from its hiding place while you go get the rest of them from upstairs.
Travis: But who?
Taliesin: At the very least, Vax, Keyleth at the very least.
Travis: Keyleth, she's bleached whiter than Whitestone.
Taliesin: Exactly, we need good people and I'm going to try and talk to it. To try and discern what it is and how it works and what it wants, and if for some strange reason things go wrong, I need people who would be more than willing to at the very least knock me out. So I'm going to be needing you and at least one other, preferably a magic user ready to deal with me if something goes weird.
Travis: I step closer to Percy. I think you only need me.
Taliesin: I need one other, just in case.
Travis: Name one other.
Taliesin: Keyleth-- Or Vax, pick-- Your choice, honestly. Whoever is less busy upstairs.
Travis: All right. I leave.
Taliesin: I'm going to take the skull out of the hiding place so he doesn't see where I'm removing it from.
Matt: Okay. While this is happening, Pike, Keyleth, Vax, Vex, Scanlan, all of you guys begin helping the guards take beds out of your rooms and bring them downstairs into the main foyer area, basically turning this into a makeshift living space for refugees. Heading towards and moving them into the temple of Sarenrae, as you go into the temple of Sarenrae, you get a bit of a feel of the damage that was sustained from the impact of the dragon upon the top of the keep.
Marisha: I follow Pike into the temple.
Matt: A large portion of the stained glass on the roof and on the outside has been shattered from rocks and boulders that were-- chunks of the top of the keep that were knocked off, and looking up you can see the roof of the keep itself sustained a fair amount of damage. Not enough to really be a serious issue, but it is in a bit of disrepair visually. As you guys are taking the beds from the upstairs to the downstairs, you do notice that a portion of the roof has caved in on the second floor. The guest room has been ruined and the southmost room, which I'll have to check to see who's supposed to be living there, is partially collapsed inwards and you can see the ceiling-- the sky from underneath. There is a fair amount of damage to the top of the keep from the impact.
Marisha: I back into a corner in the temple and collapse into a corner.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I would like to go over to a quiet spot in the temple and start saying a prayer. And I'd like to cast Planar Ally. You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. So I would like to call on Sarenrae.
Matt: All right, let me pull this up. What level is this?
Ashley: It's a 6th-level.
Matt: All right. Let's see here--
Ashley: You have to ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment.
Matt: Mm-hm. Yeah, what would you like to do?
Ashley: Well I think if I say-- Sarenrae, I've been rebuilding your temple for months, so please help us in battle and help rebuild our city, if that's service enough.
Matt: Okay. So as you reach out, you feel Sarenrae's warmth come to you, wordless. Attempting to comfort, but even then there is a trepidation in Sarenrae who is, you gather yourself, still taking in the circumstances that have happened. You feel that warmth begin to coalesce into a specific form, and everyone who has come into the temple with you gasps aloud as over these central worship platforms in the center of the temple, a glowing orb begin to form that then slowly takes the form of a humanoid with wings, similar to the ones you've worn in your celestial form. As the light fades, you can see, levitating roughly a foot off the ground, a human. White eyes and pale blue skin, hairless with a simple breastplate that's silver with gold lining on it, a single sword sheathed on the side, and beautiful white angel wings sprouting from its back. The entity stands there and looks down towards you. "I have been sent to your aid. Are you, Pike Trickfoot, to give me a task?" The voice itself seems otherworldly, and understanding the basis of the spell, you need a specific task in mind for it, and it is expensive to maintain in materials, the longer the task requires.
Ashley: Okay. We need your help. As you can see, our city has fallen to pieces by these dragons that are attacking us. And we ask that you aid us in battle somehow.
Matt: "Lead me to a battle if you wish. I haven't much time on your plane. If you have a task that I can complete at this moment." And you know that to maintain this spell cost about 100 gold per minute.
Ashley: Okay. Ah, shit. Okay.
Matt: Or 1,000 gold per hour depending on the-- Or 10,000 gold per day. Yeah, it depends on the task it required. It needs to be a little more specific than just "aid us in battle," because if there isn't a immediate battle happening, because the longer it's out, the more expensive it will be. You asked it to rebuild and it looks to you and says, "If you require my aid in rebuilding..." She looks with her head around the temple. "This I can help with quite a bit of haste, as it is within the realm of our patron lady."
Ashley: Okay, well, yes. Rebuild our keep.
Matt: "It will be done, within the hour." So you can mark off 1,000 gold worth of materials, and at this point, the Planar Ally's wings unfurl and begin to float up, and as it does it lift its hands and all the shattered stained glass begins to lift off the ground with it. And you watch as they all begin to reform.
Laura: That's pretty sick.
Matt: And begin to, through pure divine energy, rebuild the entirely of the temple around within a matter of minutes. While everyone else is looking in awe, you can begin to see around you, many people who had been shaken to the core of their being, who had lost all hope, even this visual representation of the power of Sarenrae and the faith you put into her, you can see people are now bowing in deep prayer at the center of the temple as it's being rebuilt. This has been a very impactful moment for the survivors you've taken under your wing.
Marisha: I wander over to Pike and just I grab her hand as I watch.
Matt: All right.
Laura: I'm busying myself trying to bandage any of the survivors that seem injured.
Matt: Okay. There are injuries, many sustained from rubble falling or trying to get out as fast as possible, slamming themselves into ruins or fallen rock and flaming or whatever else happened. So you tend to the wounds, so you guys are helping out with those who are hurt.
Liam: I'm helping and as we do so I say  I don't know what's going to happen in the following hours. Do not go far from me. If we are out of earshot, you are too far from me. Do not go far from me.
Laura: Do you think this is what-- Do you think this is what Mother saw before she died?
Liam: Do not go far from me.
Laura: I won't, I swear.
Matt: Percy and Grog, you find your way back up to the foyer.
Taliesin: The second he leaves the keep, I rush to pull the skull out, shut the door, put it on the table, sit down in front of it, and say, okay, talk. You have my attention.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Okay, I got a minute before he comes back.
Matt: You do, you do.
Laura: He's a dick.
Liam: He's just a sociopath, that's all. [no audio]
Travis: Fire and ice sale.
Laura: Hey, check out those Critical Role shirts on Geekandsundry.com. They sure are lovely.
Marisha: Donate to 826LA.
Marisha: Oh god, I feel like I should scootch over.
Laura: I know, can't hear it?
Liam: That is a long talk.
Taliesin: (softly) At what price?
Laura: Ugh, what is he saying? Oh my god.
Matt: All right, sorry.
Taliesin: I then take the velvet cloth and put it back over it and put it over and set it up as if I haven't talked to it.
Matt: Okay, all right, so. And once again reminding you, the skull itself, it's humanoid but it's elongated, it's not a human skull. Its jaw itself is-- you would say almost elvish, but the features are too sunken, the teeth are too long, and the skull itself is a little more oblong to the back. Yeah, you're unfamiliar what species or race this may have been when it was alive.
Travis: As I was leaving, can I notice anything about the back of his door? Like is-- a lock or is it flat, plain?
Matt: I'm gonna go ahead and have you make an investigation check.
Travis: 13. Minus two, you asshole. (laughter)
Matt: As you start walking out, you turn and look at the door and take a moment to inspect it. I mean, Grog, doors are doors, you know how to deal with doors. This is a weird door. You don't know how this door works.
Taliesin: My door is unlocked.
Matt: Right, but he doesn't understand the mechanism of what--
Taliesin: Oh, no. I built with you in mind.
Travis: I bet I can figure the lock from the inside. And I open the door and it opens because it's unlocked.
Matt: Okay, right, as soon as you throw the velvet over, the door opens up.
Travis: I go up and I try and find Vax.
Matt: Okay, you go up and you see the two of them helping people along, making eye contact. You can see the drying tears across their faces as they are trying to stay strong for those that are currently in a less emotionally stable position right now.
Travis: Sorry to break up an awkward moment, Vax, do you have a moment?
Liam: What do you need?
Travis: May I speak to you alone? No offense, Vex.
Laura: None taken. I go and help other people and call to Trinket to carry over some bandages for me.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: You and I may have had some friction recently, and we have our differences, but we're on the same side. Percy needs you downstairs. Will you come with me?
Liam: I look at my sister. What is it? What does he need?
Travis: I would tell you, but I don't want to frighten anyone in this room. It's about the-- (quieter) It's about the skull and I can only bring one. Percy's request.
Liam: Wait here.
Travis: I have to come with you.
Liam: Just wait a second. I walk over to my sister. I'm going downstairs. If I'm not back here in five minutes, I want you to come down, do you understand? And I say that because I need you, you are stronger than me and I will need you. Tend to the wounded, five minutes. I follow Grog.
Matt: All right.
Travis: I go back downstairs.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark Grog as he walks away.
Travis: What? Why?
Laura: I don't know. I just do.
Matt: Okay. I'm going ahead and say make a sleight of hand check and make a perception check.
Travis: I'm sure this is going to go dandy. 19! (laughs)
Laura: Fucking A!
Travis: I don't know why I'm so excited right now. Everything's dead.
Laura: 15.
Matt: As you're walking away, you feel this strange pulse of tingling energy. Almost like a soft--
Laura: Aw, you know what?
Matt: What?
Laura: I haven't chosen my fucking rogue ability yet, my rogue proficiency.
Liam: Rogue proficiency bump.
Laura: Too late now.
Matt: You feel this magical essence creep up on you. You are not familiar with it, but you feel like something just attached to you.
Travis: From any direction? Or just attached?
Matt: You aren't entirely sure.
Travis: I look about. Is there anything looking at me? Anybody throw anything at me? Pour anything on me?
Matt: Make a stealth check, Vex.
Laura: I'm choosing my dice. Okay, okay, okay. I get advantage on all stealth checks?
Liam: Yes. Because the cloak, yes
Laura: 24.
Matt: You look about, and in the chaos of the people, you have no idea what the source of this weird tingling was.
Travis: This keep is fucking drafty. I go downstairs.
Matt: Okay. As you walk downstairs, you find your way to Percy's workshop, we're going to take a break. (cheering)
Laura: Jeez Louise.
Liam: Thank goodness.
Matt: All right, make this one quick guys, get back into it while we still have the tension in the story going. So we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.
Travis: Five minutes, five minutes.
Liam: Five minutes. Pizza and five minutes.
Matt: You good?
Laura: Is the food here?
Matt: It should be, I hope so. [break]
Matt: Hi, my name is Matthew Mercer, I'm a voice actor and the dungeon master for Geek and Sundry's Critical Role, and welcome to my short video series for my tips on how to dungeon master or game master your own roleplaying games. So today, our first topic is going to be Encounter Building. So when you are creating an encounter, a combat encounter specifically for your party of adventurers or space marines or whatever else you are running, you want to consider what kind of terrain or region is this going to have. That's going to go ahead and help you guide what creatures are going to be there, what type of challenges might be in that way. So consider, is it a icy tundra, is it a frozen mountaintop or is it like a hot, muggy swampland, is it a underground cave network? There are actually a lot of these resource books that you can find for these RPGs that will have listings of creatures and monsters and dangers by topography, and by weather, and that's a really cool way to see what indigenous creatures might live there, and that's a good resource to pull from if you're not having any creative juices helping you decide what to put in front of them. Secondly, you want to consider how challenging you want the encounter or encounters to be. Do you want it to be a really quick scuffle, do you want it to be a series of small battles, as to opposed to fighting in a long hallway, in a spaceship? Do you want it to be one giant climatic multi-leveled boss confrontation? Once you've made that decision, that'll help you figure out how dangerous, how extensive, and how powerful the villains may be for this encounter. There's a lot of great resource manuals for every RPG system out there that have breakdowns about what creatures are good for which player levels as far as power or challenge and danger is concerned. Like, for instance, the dungeon master's guide and monster manual have a challenge rating system. A creature of a certain challenge rating is a decent challenge for a group of four players of that level, and you can slide the scale from there. Also, the DMG, or the Dungeon Master's Guide, has a experience threshold table in there as well that helps you build encounters based on the total experience points the creatures are fighting. So those are really cool resources, if you're new to the system and you're still trying to figure out how to balance that properly. Over time, eventually you'll just get a feel for it. Experience helps you get a little more comfortable with balancing the battle, and you want to make sure you don't kill all your players way too quickly in the game, either. There's also a really good website called Kobold Fight Club, for those who are running Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition campaigns, that helps them build an entire encounter with the experience table stuff that helps you get an idea of what could and could not be considered too powerful. And don't forget, if you can't find a creature or monster in these realms or any sort of villain that suits your need for the storyline or this particular battle, you can create one. Make one up or take something that's there and customize it and alter it, make it more powerful, make it weaker, you know? If you really, really want to run a game that has a bunch of kobolds as the main villain, but all your players are level ten? Go ahead and make yourself some more powerful kobolds. You can customize 'em all you want. Everything in there is just a baseline suggestion of what they think, or they created initially to be, but you can always scale them, you can make them more powerful, you can add additional hit points, make them do more damage per attack. Increase their defenses, give it some hidden resistances or vulnerabilities. You can even create whole new abilities, I customize creatures all the time for my game. I think it, one, makes it more interesting and more customized to the specific encounter and world. Secondly, for players who have been playing for a long time and pretty much memorized the monster manual, it keeps them on their toes because they'll be encountering monsters that they have yet to memorize everything about. Also, make sure, though, if you do use these creatures and you want them to have interesting defenses and vulnerabilities and the like, make sure you highlight them or note them, it's very easy to rush into combat and forget some of these cool things. So I always use a highlighter and highlight the various notes and elements of these creatures or these combat scenarios that I want to make sure that I remember and recall in the heat of battle. The next note I want to bring up is battlefields. First and foremost, not every game needs a battlefield. In fact, I kind of prefer RPGs that don't have a battle map with miniatures, it's just a way to play. I prefer to keep things in my imagination, but that's generally more wieldy with smaller groups, if you have three, maybe four players. Larger than that, it gets a little unwieldy, and me running six to eight players, it has become very necessary for everyone to keep track of their spatial awareness. When you create a map, things to consider, creative terrain. You know, think of where it's are happening, but ways to make it different on occasion, too. You can have straight forward battles with just, here's an area where they fight, here's some hallways, here's some rooms, and that's cool, too, but if you're in an urban setting, have furniture they can use to their advantage, whether it be for height or for setting up blockades. Also, consider what other challenges and confrontations they might have with the terrain during the battlefield. Is there a giant chasm they have to get across to actually get to the villain while they're attacking them from a distance? Is there some sort of arcane field that's locked off a portion of the battlefield and they have to figure out some sort of puzzle during the battle to lock it down? Is invulnerable to all damage until they can find some sort of hidden aspect of their soul locked within a nearby battlefield, or is there a bunch of innocents in there as well that are in danger of being killed from the collateral damage? Find cool and unique ways to make it an interesting battle outside of a slug fest of HP being knocked away and whoever falls first. Mind you, those can be fun, too, on occasion, but you want to make sure to keep things interesting. For those who want to create battlefields, what I use for my battlefields, because it has been requested a few times. You can use easel pad paper, one-inch grid easel pad paper that you can find online, and that's a real cool way to draw on that using markers and create your own battlefields that way. There are great tutorials online too that show you how to make cool battles and interesting-looking terrain with simple hatch-mark shading and minor colors, so I highly recommend that. Also, when you're using intelligent creatures, especially monsters or individuals or villains that are understanding their own mortality, they may flee. When they hit about half or a quarter hit points, they maybe want to get the heck out of Dodge. So don't be afraid to let your villains or enemies do that on occasion. One, it ups the stakes immediately in a battle from a slog fest to, oh crap he's getting away, and the dynamic shifts to try and prevent them from doing so. And secondly, if they do manage to get away, you may have a juicy villain who can recur later on down the story with a need for vengeance. Vengeance! Another cool note, not all battles are meant to be won, either. Sometimes you want to introduce a really powerful enemy as a foreshadowing aspect, a creature that they can in no way, shape or form defeat, and they are meant to flee from, so that they can build towards down the road, maybe coming back and finally killing it as a means of vengeance. Just make sure you try and insinuate to the players that they shouldn't stick around for the whole fight or you might have a TPK on your hands, so be careful with that one. It's a fun tool, but be careful. No, seriously, be careful. Plus, it also leaves a cool story like, "Man, you remember that one time we almost got killed by that thing?" Not all fights are meant to end in bloodshed, as well. So don't be afraid to let the players diplomatically resolve an encounter. Sometimes battles happen because of misunderstandings or misinformation or the wrong thing was said and it ticks somebody off. That doesn't mean they have to fight to the bitter end and murder whoever's in front of them. You don't want the whole murderhobo syndrome to be consistent, unless that's the campaign you're running, in which case, fight on, my murderhobos. But let the players use their social skills to try and defuse an encounter before anyone gets killed. I've many games where halfway through a battle, they're like, "Wait, they may have information we need," or, "Maybe we were duped and have the wrong information," and they decide to diplomatically end it. It doesn't always work, but it's nice to give them that option. [break]
Matt: All righty guys, welcome back. So before jumping in here real fast, we got a couple things. One, we have a winner for our next giveaway, for all you awesome subscribers out there. The winner is Blackshadow773! (cheering)
Matt: Appropriate place for a shoutout.
Laura: That's really appropriate.
Matt: We'll send you an awesome package with a bunch of goodies, Critical Role goodies, some signed stuff, some fun things coming your way, so that's fun. Also, I forgot to do it in the announcements earlier, but I have a couple of new music tracks and some things coming forward that I'll be able to incorporate into the game from awesome guys named Battlebards. They did a Kickstarter a while back to create RPG-specific music and sound effects and audio tracks and they were nice enough to give me some of their stuff to use in the show. So if you're running your own game and want some good music and soundscape stuff to work on, Battlebards' got some pretty cool stuff, so thank you guys. All righty, so. Returning as it was, Grog and Vax, you make your way down to the basement of Greyskull Keep. The door's still partially ajar as Grog left it. You enter the room--
Travis: Before we go in, I would like to put my hand on Vax. Just a note, I tried to do this by myself, but the skull asked for Percy. I know he didn't respond well with all that dark shadowy stuff, so be careful. I'm not entirely sure we can trust him with it. I wanted to do it myself, but it was either you or Keyleth, and you're a prick, so I picked you.
Liam: I don't say anything.
Matt: Okay. You guys enter. Percy is there waiting, hands behind his back. There is the table on one of his workbench areas that has a piece of tapestry that you guys originally had wrapped the skull in, draped over it, it's currently not visible.
Liam: What's going on, Percival?
Taliesin: Good. I felt that this was only possible if we had a few more witnesses. We have an artifact.
Liam: Good.
Taliesin: A skull. There is something alive inside the skull. There is something evil, or at least not good, inside the skull, and it is offering to grant us any wish we desire if we set it free. Now. Grog is inclined to take this deal. I am, and I imagine this is surprising, having some reservations. I like having the terms spelled out, and I feel that so far the terms have not been spelled out. I'm going to lift the fabric off.
Travis: I go and shut the door.
Matt: Okay, and as you lift the fabric off, and you have a look at it as well, in this controlled environment, still facing you, the skull, which once again has the elongated form, the longer teeth and jaw, it has the one gem that's embedded in the eye socket, and you can see there's a little bit of almost like a spectral swirl to it, like there's something fluid in the actual gem itself.
Liam: Well, Freddie, I imagine I'm wondering the same thing you are, at least I hope, and that's: what's in it for the skull?
Taliesin: He wants to be freed. It. How would we free you?
Matt: There's a slight pause before you can see the gem, the swirl coalesces into what looks like a spectral face. You can make out what looks to be eyes, a mouth and a nose. Though the nose itself is less of a pronounced human nose and--
Liam: I'm looking at the floor, I'm not looking at it.
Matt: Okay. But you see where the nose is, instead there are two nasal passages. And you hear a voice slowly creak out from it and say, "All that I require is for you to destroy this prison. Free my spirit from generations of torment, that is all I ask."
Liam: Hey, quick question, who are you? Who were you before you were in this prison?
Matt: "It's been too long, too long have I been here, I do not know who I am."
Liam: Ah, well, go fuck yourself. And I put the blanket over it.
Matt: The blanket covers the skull.
Liam: This seems like a very bad idea to me. Why are we doing this? Didn't we do this already, once before?
Taliesin: It was an option, and I felt it was worth exploring, and I think now we do have an option, which is we have to take it somewhere and have him identified. We have to know who this is.
Travis: What are you talking about? If it wants to be set free, fuck him, it's a wish. It's like a genie that wants out of a can, you don't grant it its wish, you get your fucking wish first.
Taliesin: It's not always genies in cans.
Liam: If we wish to rid Emon of these dragons, then we've got nothing to deal with this fucking thing right here, whatever it is.
Taliesin: I would like to know before we make any deals, we need a name.
Travis: Hold on, hold on, hold on, look, we have a chance to do good now, right now. People are dying. More people are dying.
Taliesin: We have a chance to kick the can down the road.
Travis: I don't understand.
Liam: He's speaking literally, Grog.
Taliesin: We don't know that whatever is in here could be worse than what's out there.
Liam: I had a thought--
Taliesin: But we could find out, and since it's a wish, we'll have plenty of room to fix this. We don't have to do it immediately.
Travis: Are you a betting man, Percival?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: If I told you that four giant ancient fuck-off death dragons were attacking the city and all of us barely managed to break one of its pinky toes, you're saying what's in there is worse than them?
Taliesin: I don't know. It's in there, isn't it? And how do we know the dragons weren't guarding it as opposed to it being a signal? It could be the thing they're angry about.
Liam: I think-- I have a thought I haven't spoken out loud yet. Every divine being that exists is accessible through Vasselheim. We are not equipped to handle this problem. Maybe this skull will do something, maybe, that's a bit fucking maybe. We're not equipped, and we don't know what dealing with that thing will bring. We will go to Vasselheim tomorrow. We bring all the people in this keep with us, Keyleth sends them through the tree. They stay there, we find help. We cannot handle this on our own. My first instinct was to go back in for Uriel. We don't know what's happened to Uriel! But we can't do it, we are powerless against those things. Against one of them, let alone four. We need help.
Taliesin: I wave my hand, and the skull drops into a shadow on the table and vanishes.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Did that blanket just blob down?
Taliesin: The blanket vanished into the shadow as well, it's now just a shadow. I've put it back in its hiding place.
Travis: What the fuck was that?
Taliesin: That was a reminder that you should know what you're dealing with before you touch power.
Travis: Can you do magic?
Taliesin: Yes. I'm not going to pretend I always make the best calls. But I at least would like to know its name.
Travis: (sighs) Fucking pussy. We have a chance to save this city now.
Taliesin: We have a chance to stop anything worse from happening, or we have a chance to unleash something far worse on it.
Liam: Grog, know your strengths, it is your strength--
Taliesin: I am a betting man, and this is a bad bet.
Travis: Can I walk up to the shadow table?
Matt: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: Can I start looking around it? Do I see anything?
Matt: It looks like there's the dark spot on the table, and as you reach your hand out, it's just a solid table.
Liam: I look at Percival. We need to talk to the girls.
Matt: And as you reach your hand past that into the shadow, because I assume that this is the--
Taliesin: You know exactly what I did. Is he reaching or is he--
Travis: I did not reach, I'm looking on top of it, on the sides, underneath.
Matt: Yeah, currently it looks like literally where the cloth and skull once were, there is a dark spot and shadow.
Travis: No button, no latches, no holes for quarters?
Matt: Nope.
Laura: I'm knocking on the door.
Taliesin: Your plan is good. It just requires a little bit more study. It's a good plan.
Travis: Study.
Laura: Are you in there?
Taliesin: Yes, come, please come in.
Laura: I open the door.
Matt: Unlocked, Vex walks in.
Laura: Well, what's this big master plan you're all plotting?
Taliesin: Vex. Vax, do you want to-- Well, actually, we might as well get Keyleth down here as well.
Liam: Pike as well.
Taliesin: Pike, Keyleth, meet me in my-- I'm going to walk and attempt to gently scoop the skull up and put it behind me.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: To catch things up, I walk out the door and I'm going to get the other two.
Laura: Did I notice that, I have a really good passive perception?
Matt: You do, you see him scoot go over to the table and move something behind his back.
Travis: Who did? (laughter)
Matt: You don't know. You head up to the main foyer area where the stairs come up through the armory and lead into to the main hallway that bisects the center of the main floor, just as Keyleth and Pike are coming out of the temple after being summoned.
Liam: All right, I beeline right up to them and I drop down in front of Pike. Pike. Keyleth. We're working on a plan, and we don't have one yet, but Pike-- and I'm down on my knee-- you need to guide Grog. He doesn't listen to anyone else, he only listens to you.
Marisha: Is something wrong?
Liam: Yes and no. It's better if you just come. Pike, come.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: And I take Keyleth's hand and pull her after me.
Travis: Who's in the room right now?
Matt: Right now it's just you, Percy, and Vex.
Travis: I shut the door.
Matt: Okay. Grog walks over and closes the door.
Travis: I want that skull. I want it now.
Laura: This is about the skull, then?
Travis: Yeah. Percy's trying to do some fucked-up shit with the skull.
Marisha: Wait, did you close the door?
Travis: I did.
Matt: You guys aren't there yet. This hasn't happened yet, you guys are still walking down the stairs.
Taliesin: He can't lock it.
Travis: No, but I can stand in front of it. I want the skull, right now.
Taliesin: Let me see your sword.
Travis: No, you don't want to see the sword.
Laura: Oh shit.
Taliesin: I point at the table and I say  reach into the shadow and see if you can take the skull.
Travis: No, I don't think so, your water fucked me up last time. You get it out of the table.
Laura: Can I insight check them to see who is fucking with who--
Taliesin: Good luck.
Laura: -- and who has better intentions right now?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: Double insight check? Okay, the gold one is for Percy, and the thorny one is for Grog.
Liam: Naturally.
Laura: Whoa! Good for both of them, motherfucker! The gold one is a 27 for Percy and-- 15 plus eight, what is 15 plus eight?
Liam: 15 plus eight is naturally 23.
Laura: 23 for Grog.
Matt: Okay, I rolled it for both of them. Was one of those a natural 20?
Laura: No, but one of them is 27 and 23.
Matt: Right, 27 and 23, okay, good. Looking at them both, they're still very guarded and you are unable to really--
Laura: Both of them? Seriously, Matt?
Matt: Yeah. I mean, it doesn't absolve any of your suspicion by any means, but they're both locked in this intense stare-off and you in the center of it as you dart back and forth to try and see any give, any twitch, anything that would possibly show an ounce of what is going on in their heads. It's the best poker faces you've seen on either of them in a while.
Liam: Are we at the door yet?
Matt: You guys are now getting to the door.
Liam: Hey, big man, Trickfoot wants to talk to you.
Taliesin: I look Grog right in the eye before they come in. I very quietly say: does your friend have an opinion on the skull?
Travis: Which friend?
Taliesin: Your new friend.
Laura: What the fuck? What the fuck is going on?! What fucking friend and--
Travis: Vex.
Laura: I saw you, Percival.
Taliesin: You did.
Marisha: I put my ear to the door. Can I hear them a little bit?
Matt: You guys can hear shouting from the other side, but it's too thick.
Ashley: Can I try opening it?
Matt: Yeah, it's unlocked, and you open the door and it stops as if there's a door stop directly behind it. You feel the door slamming you in the back, Grog.
Travis: Okay.
Taliesin: Or pick who you trust. I trust your judgment.
Travis: Trust? Vex, listen to me. What did you see?
Laura: Who's your friend?
Travis: (sighs) The skull grants a wish. It can only be used by those with dark presence around them. That's Percy, that's me. How has Percy done with dark shit in the past? I went to him for help because I'm trying to free the city of these fucking dragons, but it wanted Percy. I tried to keep it for myself. And now he's up to his shady shit all over again.
Laura: It specifically wants Percy?
Travis: It wanted Percy.
Taliesin: And I said 'no.'
Travis: The hell you did.
Marisha: (yelling) Wait, who wanted who?
Ashley: Can we wiggle in?
Matt: You can try to, but Grog, you hold the door shut? The door's not moving.
Liam: Okay, I'm going to quick, rapid-fire-- I was hoping to bring everybody in, but say: listen to me. Percy's got this fucking skull and we-- Everything about it. It's a skull, it's talking about granting a wish, it's fucking fucked up just like the fucking smoke demon that was in Percival. I don't understand what's going on yet, but both Grog and Percival are a little fucked up, but Grog is more fucked up, but I don't understand everything. But things are not good.
Marisha: What?
Ashley: What's going on?
Marisha: Hearing Vax unload that information, if I reach through the crack in the door, can I touch Grog?
Matt: There's just enough of a gap where you could probably get an arm through.
Marisha: Like my tiny little female hand.
Matt: Pike, what are you doing?
Ashley: Can I push the door open? Or at least try?
Matt: Try to. Pike, make a strength check.
Ashley: Yeah, go first, go first.
Marisha: I reach through, and if I can grab Grog, I cast Hold Person on him.
Travis: Cool, I'll stay right where I am.
Marisha: Well-- Then we can push him over, right?
Matt: You can try, yeah. All right, so. Hold Person: does it require--
Travis: I weigh like 600 pounds.
Marisha: There's three of us, we can push real hard.
Liam: We can get Jarett.
Matt: All right. So, looking at Hold Person here, hold on just a second.
Marisha: Oh, wait! Wait, can I redact that? Can I redact that?
Travis: No, you already said it.
Matt: It has to be a humanoid you can see within range. So you couldn't even Hold Person through the door.
Marisha: Beautiful-- Even better.
Taliesin: You read the spell, didn't you?
Liam: Scanlan, Scanlan, join us. Please, quickly, please.
Matt: Scanlan goes, "I'm trying to help some folks, but if you insist, all right."
Liam: I do, I do insist.
Travis: Vex. If he has the skull, we've got to get it from him now.
Laura: Percy?
Taliesin: I have the skull. I'm not going to use it, I don't trust him not to use it, yet.
Laura: How about you guys give me the skull, I'm not even touched by anything dark.
Travis: That's a great idea.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Travis: Yeah. Give her the skull.
Taliesin: All right, I pull it out from behind me and hand it to you. It's in the bag, wrapped in cloth.
Laura: Oh god. I'm going to get fucking attacked by Grog. I'm going to back up into a corner and hold on to it and look down at it.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I'm holding onto it? Jesus.
Matt: You are holding onto it, and it's wrapped in the tapestry that you guys threw over it originally, but you can feel it in your hands, and it's not terribly heavy, it has some heft to it, and just having it there, you're already getting pins and needles on the back of your neck.
Liam: Now, Shorthalt, now.
Marisha: Is he trying to bamf in? Scanlan?
Matt: No, no. So, Pike, what are you doing?
Ashley: I want to try and push in the door open.
Matt: Okay. Make a strength check. Grog, make a strength check.
Ashley: With all my strength.
Taliesin: I love you, Travis. (laughter)
Marisha: While she pushes, can I get up against the crack to see if I can see through while she pushes?
Travis: 17.
Ashley: Eight.
Matt: The door lurches, but you hold it solidly in place. You can feel--
Ashley: Grog! Let me in!
Travis: Just a fuck-- just a minute!
Ashley: I've been waiting five minutes! (laughter)
Taliesin: Put your pants on, Grog, really.
Liam: Just another minute, mom.
Laura: I think this is probably the stupidest thing, why did I decide to hold it?
Travis: Give me the skull, you don't want Percy to have it.
Laura: I don't want either of you to have it.
Taliesin: Don't give me the skull, but don't give him the skull either.
Travis: If you want to, you can ask it what it wants, and then you'll know, or you can give it to me and we can be done with this.
Marisha: Are we trying to hand Grog the evil things?
Laura: I take the tapestry off it and I ask it, what the fuck do you want? What the fuck are you? What the fuck is this?
Matt: As you look down at the skull, which you guys still can't get through because Grog's holding the door, and you don't have a visual in there because he's holding it pretty close to completely shut. As you look down, you can see now in the gem, formulating in the middle of it, this swirl of a face that comes right up to the front. You can see in the midst of its coloration these energy-based eyes and grin, a toothy grin that goes, "I wish to be freed. That is all. I've been here far too long. I grow tired. I want to finally pass."
Laura: Are you Vecna?
Matt: You hear a chuckle. "No. Vecna has been long gone. I am not a being of such power."
Laura: Can I insight check the fucking thing in the eyeball?
Matt: Sure, make a insight check.
Laura: Sure, no problem. Unless it was a natural 20, it doesn't matter, 15, no.
Matt: 15, you don't.
Laura: No. Way higher than 15, 21.
Matt: Okay. 21, thank you.
Laura: 22, I can add.
Matt: 22, okay, that's way higher. You take a look at it, but due to the fact that it's mostly hidden, there aren't facial tics and there aren't normal gives to what a person's intent is, and even the tone of voice itself is spectral, ominous and otherworldly. You have a hard time being able to read whether or not it's being honest or lying or anything in between.
Liam: Scanlan here yet?
Laura: Why would we free it?
Matt: Scanlan is now behind the door on the other side, and he enters the room with you guys and is like, "What's going on, everything cool?"
Liam: Wait, the door is open now?
Matt: No, he's with you guys.
Liam: Ah good, yeah, Bigby that shit.
Travis: I bum rush Vex.
Ashley: No, Dimension Door me in, please.
Taliesin: I think we need a name for the thing.
Travis: I bum rush Vex.
Taliesin: I'm using quick draw.
Marisha: What?
Matt: Initiative rolls from both of you guys.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Does this mean the door flies open?
Ashley: Yeah, the door flies open.
Matt: Just a moment.
Liam: This is all seconds, this is happening in seconds.
Travis: 14.
Laura: Do I roll anything? Can I do anything?
Taliesin: 28.
Travis: Ugh, Jesus. 28?!
Matt: I'll say roll with disadvantage, because it catches you entirely off-guard.
Laura: So this is a surprise attack. Ugh, that's lame. That was just 13.
Matt: Okay, and you had a--?
Travis: 14.
Matt: 14, okay. All right, so, you see Grog lower his head and then go for a burst run across the length of the workshop towards Vex. You instinctually go quick draw, what are you doing?
Taliesin: I'm shooting a warning shot past his head, diving in, taking the--
Laura: Are you close enough? I backed into a corner.
Taliesin: I've got six spaces of movement in my turn.
Matt: Yeah, it's not a big room.
Taliesin: Diving and grabbing the head and curling back around--
Travis: The head? The skull?
Taliesin: Grabbing the skull and going--
Travis: She's 50/50 distance between us.
Taliesin: I'm moving first.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And I'm happy to spend an action surge if that'll make this work better.
Laura: Do you think you can just grab it from me?
Liam: D&D standoff.
Taliesin: I can make a roll for it.
Matt: So, as you dart, Percy is waiting for someone to also dart, and both of you go rushing across the room. Percy manages to get there a fraction of a second before you do. You hear the blast of his pistol past your ear, and the ringing hits the center of your head, but you still continue pushing forward in the way that Grog does, ignoring all outside interference. However, you've gotten to the skull first. Are you going to attempt to wrestle it from her?
Taliesin: Gently pull it out of his run. So I'm going pull it--
Laura: Are you going to try to pull me out of the way or just the fucking skull, you dick?
Matt: She's pretty grappled to it.
Taliesin: Oh, if she's that grappled to it, then I'm going to try and push her out of the way of Grog.
Matt: Okay, opposed strength checks from both of you.
Laura: From me?
Matt: Yeah, make a strength check.
Travis: He doesn't seem to care much.
Laura: He really, really doesn't.
Taliesin: 15.
Laura: Ah, that's terrible-- nine.
Taliesin: It's less of a shove and more of a pull out of the way of Grog's rush.
Matt: Right, so, he reaches over and grabs the skull in your arm and pulls you--
Taliesin: Well, I grab her.
Matt: Right, she-- but you haven't pulled it from her grip, you pull her out of the way. Shoves you to the side. You go rushing forward, and as you get there, she is pulled to the side, she is still right there in front of you, but the bum rush didn't get you there before anybody could react. So now it's your turn.
Laura: It's my turn?
Matt: Yeah. Wait, you rolled a 13?
Laura: I rolled a 13.
Matt: Oh, never mind, Grog goes next. Grog, so you rush up and you can now see Percy, pistol out, hand on the side of Vex, off the side of her arm. She's holding the skull there and they're both looking at you expectantly. What are you doing to do?
Travis: I want Percy. I'm going to tackle Percy.
Matt: You what?
Travis: I am going to run straight towards Percy and tackle him.
Matt: Tackle him, okay, all right. So, let's get some proper rumble music for this.
Marisha: There are dragons outside and we're fighting, playing rugby with a fucking skull.
Travis: I'm trying to fix the dragons.
Matt: Okay, so you use the momentum of the rush and you see him do this, you turn out of the way and go for a shoulder shove. I want you to go ahead and make an attack roll. Actually, make an athletics roll versus your acrobatics.
Travis: Why can't that be higher? 19.
Taliesin: Ah shit, 14.
Matt: 14, I need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh shit. 17, oh, saving throw. 21.
Matt: 21. You slam into him and you essentially shove him with the shoulder. You manage to knock him prone, but the skull doesn't come loose, he loses his grip on it, and currently Vex is still holding it front of you. You're prone on the ground.
Taliesin: I'm prone on the ground?
Travis: So Vex still has it?
Taliesin: But it's Vex's turn.
Travis: But I knocked him off of her. But you've still got the skull.
Taliesin: I wasn't trying to wrestle it.
Matt: Anything else you want to try and accomplish?
Travis: Yeah, I would like to turn and put my back to Vex, because she has the skull.
Matt: Okay. So you go and plant a protective position in front of her? It's now your turn. Grog, who rushes over and shoulder slams Percy out of the way, and he's fallen to the ground. His gun almost scatters to the floor of the workshop around you. As you're expecting, he turns towards you, instead he steps and his giant frame is now blocking you with the shoulder blades in front, his arms out in a defensive position, facing off with people as they begin to enter the room. What are you going to do?
Laura: I reach up and I touch his back. And I say are you yourself?
Travis: Me?
Laura: Yes, you, fuck!
Travis: Yeah, yes, fuck, it's me.
Laura: I back up into a corner, and I say  what is all this about? Why do you even need this? Why do we want to set it free? I don't understand.
Travis: We don't, we don't, we just don't want him to have Percy.
Marisha: The rest of us see this now, right?
Matt: At this point now, the door's burst open, and the rest of you guys rush in and you can see Percy just as he hits the ground. You can see Grog recovering from the shoulder slam, who then steps in front of Vex with this snarl on his face and begins shouting to her over his shoulder, and you hear them talking across the room.
Taliesin: It doesn't want me, I don't want to use the skull. I want to keep you from using it.
Ashley: What is going on in here?!
Marisha: Keyleth cracks her staff on the floor and does a Gust cantrip and goes (whoosh) to make a big burst of wind in the room.
Matt: Okay. Tools go falling off the wall and clattering to the stone floor of the establishment. All of you who have hair have it blown and wrapped around you. You are pushed back about three inches from the burst of it, and all of you, immediately, your attention goes to Keyleth who stands there with her staff.
Travis: Is it dusty in there now? Or is it just windy?
Matt: It's not dusty, it's covered in layers of soot that have now been kicked up, and the air itself is a temporary fume.
Travis: Do we have an order?
Marisha: Silence!
Matt: She does that. Pike, what are you doing?
Ashley: Can I insight-check Grog?
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Ashley: 21.
Matt: What are you trying to know?
Travis: What are you trying to know?
Ashley: I want to know why he wants this skull so bad.
Matt: Okay. If you would like to relay any information, she peered pretty well into your demeanor.
Travis: I want to get rid of the dragons, now.
Matt: So you gather that he's coming from a place that a simple mind is looking for a simple solution to a complex problem. (laughter)
Laura: "I'm right here, Matt."
Taliesin: Burn, burn!
Travis: Oh, oh, the flames, ah! (laughter)
Travis: Stop, drop, and roll!
Matt: I'm saying that's the best way she can discern your demeanor right now. Pike, anything else you want to do right now? We have to continue this.
Ashley: Yep. Can I walk over and grab Craven Edge?
Matt: Craven Edge is currently sheathed on his back, away from you. So you can attempt to, if you want to.
Ashley: Grog, can you give me Craven Edge, please?
Matt: Pike, hands out to you and looking you earnestly in the face.
Travis: Why?
Ashley: I just want to look at it.
Marisha: Pike, you sure about this?
Ashley: I just want to see, something's not quite right.
Taliesin: Can I get up at this point or no?
Matt: We are about to get back to the top of the round. So you do what you're doing, okay. Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to stand up and grab a poker off the table. I'm leaving my gun on the floor.
Matt: Not off the table, the wind gust knocked off a lot of these things on the ground. Small pile of tools next to you. So you grab the poker.
Taliesin: I grab a poker and I take a corner.
Matt: Okay. So now, Percy, you've squared off into a corner, there's Vex in the other corner, Grog's standing in between the two with the back against Vex. The three of you are right there at the front. Pike has stepped up to Grog now and is beseeching him. That's Percy. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I look at Pike. I turn around, I look at Vex. You'll thank me. And I'd like to try and pull the skull out of her hands.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check against her.
Laura: Oh jeez, oh come on. There's no way, even if I roll like a-- Unless I get a 20.
Travis: 21.
Laura: No, that's 14.
Matt: All right. As Grog turns around and gives you almost an apologetic look, his face steels over with intensity as, lightning-fast, his muscular arms rush out in front, grasp the skull. Like tearing a toy from a child's grasp, it is removed from you with barely any sort of resistance.
Marisha: Can I get a spell off on him?
Matt: Not yet. So Grog, that's your action. You grab and you have now the skull. You left her with the tapestry, like you have just the bare skull in front of you.
Travis: What would I like to do with it?
Matt: You have a bonus action, so depends on what you're trying to accomplish.
Travis: Can I spike it?
Matt: You can, yeah, I'd say yeah.
Taliesin: That's a bonus action?
Matt: I'd say this would be your movement and bonus, I'll let you do that, the whole thing together.
Travis: I would like to spike the skull.
Taliesin: Oh Jesus.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Laura: You're just going to--
Travis: What are the fucking chances?!
Matt: A natural one?
Laura: Yes. (laughter)
Matt: As you reach up, at the apex of your throw you look down and--
Travis: I don't believe it. I don't fucking believe it.
Matt: Your eyes catch Pike, and during that brief moment of slow-motion as you reach up, you see her face, this look of complete, heartbreaking disappointment. Just like that. It shakes you in a way that you didn't expect, and as you go through the motion you already anticipated, and your brain's already wandered in doing so. You slam it half-heartedly and it bounces and skids across the ground, over by where Keyleth is.
Marisha: Is it rolling at my feet?
Laura: I run and jump for it.
Matt: All right, so. It's not your turn, it's the end of your turn. As it goes rolling, you run and dodge, go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Damn it.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23, all right. You jump out of the way, tumble, roll, and scoop up it in your arms once more, and you have it.
Marisha: Can I get a spell off?
Matt: You have to get to your turn. Is that all you're going to do?
Laura: That was all of it? Can I run out of the room? If I can move. I'm going to run towards the door.
Matt: I'd say, yeah. With the tumble and everything, you have just enough movement to get out of the room. So Vex goes darting out of the workshop, just past the door, leaving the room. That brings us now to--
Liam: Relay race. Okay, then I take a step in front of her and pull out my daggers and stand in front of my sister.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: What the fuck is happening? Seeing all of this happen, I cast Hold Person.
Travis: Stop trying to protect the skull.
Marisha: At 4th-level.
Matt: To? Against?
Marisha: Against Percy, Grog--
Laura: I'm out of the room, you can't see me.
Liam: I'm in.
Marisha: How far away are they? Can I turn around and see--
Matt: I'd say she just got out of the room, you would have visual on her as she's leaving the room, yeah.
Marisha: What about Vax?
Matt: Yeah, Vax is standing in front of her, you have visual on both, technically.
Travis: Don't do this.
Liam: This is so metal.
Marisha: Vex. Vex. Sorry, Vex.
Matt: All right, I need a wisdom saving throw from all three of you.
Liam: Wait, me too?
Laura: No, just me. Yeah, you fucks are still mobile.
Travis: Natural 20.
Matt: Boom, Percy?
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: 15, that's a failure.
Laura: 21.
Matt: So Percy, your muscles tense up, and as you're holding your poker, you find yourself unable to move. Grog, you feel and look over and see Keyleth as she looks towards you with intensity, and you feel a similar tremor across your head, but you shrug it off.
Travis: These fucking sensations today.
Matt: Yeah, it's weird. Vex, you as well, you glance over your shoulder as you hear Keyleth muttering under her breath, and you can feel that familiar sensation of the magical attempt to grasp your mind. Your half-elven self makes it even easier to shrug off, and you continue darting forth the direction you are with your brother behind you. So you're protecting her?
Liam: Oh yes, I'm barring the way
Laura: So we're right up the hallway from our prison cell, right?
Matt: Correct. I haven't got to your turn yet, though. So, does that end your turn? Do you want to move?
Marisha: Can I say something?
Matt: If you want to, yeah
Marisha: Everyone, stop, why are we fighting? We just watched our city burn to the ground. What are we fighting over?
Travis: We're not fighting, they're trying to protect the skull.
Marisha: What does this look like? What does this look like to you?
Travis: A statue garden?
Marisha: Everyone, get in Percy's workshop and we're going to talk this out.
Matt: Pike, it's your turn.
Laura: Keyleth, you don't know what's happening.
Marisha: I would if any of my fucking party would for once tell me something. You all didn't tell me the full fucking story when we went back into General Krieg's house, and now look what happened. Look what happened because you assholes aren't communicating.
Taliesin: (muffled mumbling)
Marisha: Shut up, Percy! (laughter)
Matt: Pike, it's your turn.
Marisha: This is because of us, and you all know it is. Let's figure this out. Go, Pike. (laughter)
Ashley: Grog, did you just say you want to protect the skull?
Travis: No, I want to break the skull. I want to get rid of the dragons
Ashley: Okay, what were you trying to do when you brought Percy and Vex up here?
Liam: Vax.
Travis: It needed someone with a dark touch. But now it's--
Ashley: To do what?
Travis: To get the wish, but now it's touching everyone, they're trying to protect the skull, and we don't want that. We want it broken, I think.
Ashley: But you want the wish?
Travis: Yeah, we want the wish, we can do whatever we want to with the wish and not take it, but yeah.
Ashley: There has to be some type of payment, if we take a wish.
Travis: Well, it didn't say anything about a payment. There are four dragons killing everything.
Matt: At this point, as you guys are having this conversation, and you guys are darting out, Vex, you stop, as coming down the stairs from the main floor is Erwen. Frazzled, but still put together as well as he can.
Laura: I tuck it behind my back.
Matt: "I'm sorry, Lady Vex'ahlia, it appears you have a few guests, suddenly."
Laura: What? What kind of guests?
Matt: "She's been here before. I don't recognize the other; in the dining area."
Laura: What does she look like?
Matt: "Blonde hair."
Travis: Allura.
Matt: "Dwarven individual."
Marisha: Oh my god, it's Allura and Kima.
Liam: This is a little like Clue  the Movie.
Laura: It kind of is. Yes-- Erwen. Bring them down here. It's an emergency
Matt: "Very well, I'll--"
Laura: As quickly as possible.
Matt: "Yes, yes." And he turns around and hustles up the stairs.
Marisha: Can we all please go back in Percy's workshop?
Laura: Not yet, darling.
Marisha: Why not?
Liam: Keyleth, let's just wait until Allura gets here. I feel like she might have a calming effect on this situation, an outside eye.
Marisha: We are standing in the damn hall, all I am asking is that we move into a quiet room.
Matt: At this point now, at the top of the stairway, two individuals come walking down. First and foremost, you see a dwarven male with short black hair and a beard, trimmed fairly fine, red leathers, carrying some sort of crooked wand on the side. Behind him you see, hair tossed back as she rushes down after him, Arcanist Allura Vysoren.
Liam: I sheath my daggers.
Matt: Okay. She looks about curiously and the dwarf goes, "Okay, what have we stepped into here?" And Allura puts her hand on his shoulder and goes, "Don't worry. I apologize for my intrusion. I had a-- is everything all right?"
Laura: We could use your help at this moment.
Matt: "Certainly. Sorry, this is a long-time friend of mine, Elementalist Drake Thunderbrand. If you don't mind him accompanying us as well?"
Laura: Is he good?
Matt: "Oh, he's one of the finest."
Laura: A good person?
Matt: "I've put my life in his hands a number of times, yes."
Liam: Things are a lot more complicated than you can even imagine. Please come in, we need you.
Matt: "Yes, yes." And as you guys are having this standoff, you watch as this black-haired, red-leathered dwarf walks in, looking around and inspecting intently. You don't recognize him, you've never seen him before
Travis: What's he wielding?
Matt: No weapons on him. You see him clutching this gnarled, curved wand that almost spirals, like a piece of well-treated but messed up wood.
Travis: A stick.
Laura: That's a weapon.
Matt: Maybe. And Allura rushes in, muttering under her breath, "I was just in Whitestone and I had a terrible feeling come over me and all my teleportation sigils within the city were suddenly severed. Both my tower and the Lyceum. I had to manually teleport us here as it was the only place I really had enough familiarity with far enough away from the city in case something bad had happened, I hope you don't mind."
Laura: Not at all. We're grateful for your help.
Liam: Could you do us a favor? We had a small accident with Percival.
Laura: Not yet, not yet.
Travis: Does she know about the-- D--?
Liam: No. So... Emon is in ruins. It's been destroyed by dragons.
Laura: Four. Ancient. Dragons.
Marisha: They call themselves the Chroma Conclave.
Liam: And your tower is--
Travis: Fucked!
Laura: We're sorry.
Marisha: I'll go ahead and drop the Hold Person on Percy.
Matt: And her face goes white, the blood runs from her entire complexion, and you can see the dwarf that initially was huffed up and intense in his energy, while not fully understanding what's going on, looks over to Allura and softens and walks up and puts his hand on her shoulder. "You okay, lass?"
Liam: I'm sorry, my lady. Did you know that Uriel planned to step down?
Matt: "He threatened it--"
Liam: He did it.
Matt: "-- for weeks-- what?"
Liam: He did it, and moments later four old dragons descended upon the city.
Marisha: The Cloudtop District has been demolished.
Matt: "This cannot be."
Marisha: We don't know who all is alive or dead. We can only expect the worst.
Matt: "This cannot be."
Laura: Unfortunately, Allura, all of that is the reason for our current impasse. We seem to have discovered something that could potentially reverse the situation. But there's a great price to pay. It could be a small price to pay, we don't know. If you wouldn't mind taking a look at this relic that we discovered.
Matt: And you see, she is still lost in thought and there's something in her mind that's distracting her immensely, but she eventually clarifies and her eyes focus on you once more and she goes, "Of course, please."
Laura: I don't give it to her, but I pull the tapestry off of the skull and show it to her.
Matt: She looks at it and leans forward and begins muttering something beneath her breath, and she goes into technical mode, like she distracts herself with work at this moment. And as her brow furrows, she mutters under her breath and completes some sort of flash of arcane energy, and you can see the flash of energy attaches around the skull for a second and glints back at her, and she goes, "Right, all right, that's-- That skull is not human, that skull is Githyanki. That is a species that exists primarily on the Astral Plane. They're rowdy, evil, pirating, marauding individuals, and that's one sense. The gem within that skull appears to be a soul gem and contains the soul of, from what I can gather, a Githyanki individual. Very old. I can say at least from my knowledge and learned opinion that no good can come from such an artifact."
Laura: Okay. He can grant a wish, he says? Lying, truth? What do you think?
Matt: "It's hard to say. It would take a very powerful individual to do so, however, I would say that wishes granted by entities that do not correspond with your moral outlook for the most part rarely end up in your favor, even when carefully worded."
Laura: Right. No, but I remember this, we dealt with this with the demon that killed Pike.
Marisha: Yes, but we used our wish to wish ourselves out of that contract.
Laura: And it had to be so carefully worded.
Marisha: We can destroy more, if we're not careful.
Matt: "There have been powerful individuals, who upon obtaining the ability to make such a wish, even as careful as they were, they reached beyond the means of its magic, and doing so, undid themselves. It's a very, very powerful, very dangerous magic, and if this entity is indeed even capable of doing so, who's to say the chances that it wouldn't wreak more havoc than you intended?"
Liam: We are in a precarious position. The city is in ruins, already, in a matter of hours.
Matt: "Yes, yes."
Marisha: What do we do?
Matt: And at this point, she looks around for a chair. You can see her hands are shaking, and she goes and grabs a chair and pulls it up and sits down for a second, puts her hands on her knees, and quietly, "Describe to me these dragons."
Marisha: There was one of each color.
Laura: A green, a black, a white.
Travis: And a big red piece of shit.
Marisha: All colors except for blue of the chromatic spectrum. I got a few of their names.
Matt: As you go through each color, she nods, but when you say the big red, her body freezes.
Marisha: Does this sound familiar to you?
Matt: "The names, you said?"
Marisha: There's a white dragon that called himself Vorugal. A green dragon, Raishan. Black dragon, Umbrasyl, and the red dragon, we haven't heard his name yet. He seems to be the leader.
Matt: At this point she nods and goes, "I know not the middle two, but Vorugal has been known to wander the wastes north in Othanzia. Some of the offspring have wandered further, in fact I believe the Skysunder that you destroyed naught but two years ago that was sealed in the Frostweald was one of its brethren. Its children. But Vorugal has not been seen wandering this far out. Chromatics do not work together, they are selfish and greedy and territorial."
Laura: They're definitely working together.
Matt: "This red you say is the leader?"
Liam: Yes, most definitely.
Marisha: He had a message that he belted over the entire city. He said that we who live, he's showing mercy and that we can either fight or flee, and then--
Laura: He said if we fight or flee, we'll be denied the mercy.
Marisha: Okay, something along those lines. And then he said that it was the guardians of this city that brought this upon Emon, and that he has control. He called it like a new order.
Laura: He said our new purpose is to serve him.
Matt: Now for the first time, you have known Allura for quite some time, she's been a very stoic, strong, confident, and powerful person. At this moment, she has withered. She looks genuinely like she's hit a level of fear you have never seen in an individual like this, and it shakes you to see this upon her face, and she puts her hand up and says, "This is not your fault. This burden is mine." And looks over to the dwarf and says, "It is ours." And the dwarf, you can now see, he's nodding in understanding. "This dragon... it's been called many names, but the one that it's taken is Thordak, The Cinder King."
Marisha: Thordak?
Matt: "Thordak. This terrible beast lorded over half of Marquet for centuries, taking the scalding sands as its domain and its denizens as cattle, and just as the city of Ank'harel was becoming the jewel of the desert, Thordak struck. A battle, however, that it was unable to win. Sent away, mortally wounded, it was thought that the dragon had died soon after, having not been seen for many centuries since. That is, until about 15 years ago. The rumors of a powerful drake, storming the beaches and seas, had been whispered for a long time, while ships would be lost at sea. It had survived and secretly ruled the island of Viscan in the south of the Lucidian Ocean. I suppose after generations, the dragon, now self-crowned as the Cinder King, grew greedier with the island's limited resources and began razing the Mournset countryside south of the Verdant Expanse and the Stormcrest Mountains." And her eyes get even more distant as she is recalling all this. "Reports of a dragon more massive than the records can compare hit Tal'Dorei. At the time, I wasn't part of the council. I traveled with a group of adventurers much like yourselves: Kima, Drake here, and a handful of other brave souls who are no longer with us. We traveled to investigate, but arrived to find this creature destroying everything surrounding the Glade Pools. Port Udall, gone, Byroden a smoldering ruin, and we gathered a small army of mercenaries and hunted it back to its new den in the Stormcrest, where a large number of lizardfolk had formed around him. But we were overpowered by the sheer might of the dragon. Many lives were lost. Knowing that we could not kill it, we turned to other means. I called upon the Arcana Pansophical, a circle of friends, arcane practitioners that agreed to work together across the land to keep them safe. They devised a trap, one that could, we believed, permanently seal Thordak within the elemental plane of fire, preventing him from ever returning to our world. At the sacrifice of many, including our companions Sirus, Dohla, Ghenn, we succeeded." And as the tears begin to roll down her face, she looks around. "For naught now, it seems, and somehow he has broken our invocation. We bound his essence to the fountains of creation and thought he would stay there forever." And she goes quiet and looks around for a second. "I'm sorry."
Taliesin: This couldn't be because of our journey to the elemental plane, could it?
Matt: "I'm so sorry."
Taliesin: We saw him there.
Marisha: We did, but it sounds like he has been....
Taliesin: We didn't set him free, you don't think?
Travis: No, it was Keyleth's Ashari thing.
Marisha: My people-- Our job is to guard these realms.
Taliesin: Is there any way of contacting the Fire Ashari?
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, oh god. Oh god, what if they're-- what if they're dead?
Matt: "To bind him, we created an artifact called a soul anchor. It was crafted from the salvaged heart crystal of a primordial fire titan. The anchor could not be removed from the plane, and the Cinder King could not leave without it. I don't know how he's managed to escaped the binding of this."
Marisha: Oh my god, this is all my fault.
Taliesin: No. No. This was a land mine waiting to be stepped on.
Marisha: But wait. We fought-- We fought my elders, we fought the Headmaster.
Laura: It couldn't have been.
Matt: "That would have no bearing on this. The heart crystal is immense. 15, 20 feet in diameter, it's a gem of pure crystallized ruby and elemental power and energy. Lest you managed to find this and destroy it, which, I mean no offence, is far beyond your capability."
Marisha: My people, would they be okay?
Matt: "Depends on where he made his way through. The timing is rather conspicuous, seeing as how Winter's Crest recently passed, in which time the planes are the thinnest barricades."
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Whatever it is, I fear that our ruse will not work twice, especially if Thordak has had all this time to obsess over his failure. I do not know our next course of action."
Marisha: What do you know of General Krieg?
Matt: "He's been gone for some time."
Marisha: You were on the council with him, do you know anything further?
Matt: "I think it was discussed that he had been killed during the demonic intrusion in the city, or deserted."
Laura: Would a dragon seek vengeance against one of their brethren killed?
Matt: "Chromatics are selfish beings, they do not care for each other, and the power of one is enough, but a conclave of dragons is both extraordinary and horrifying, but there is no-- There is no sense of vengeance for their kin unless it is against the greater plan. Now, if what you say is true and these other dragons are bound together in the service of Thordak, I imagine they would be the ones who had the power and the resources to find some way to bring him through."
Laura: All right.
Matt: At which point, the dwarf steps up and still has his hand rubbing Allura's shoulder and says, "We knew not what we were doing, other than trying to save it, don't blame yourself."
Marisha: Allura.
Matt: "Yes."
Marisha: Would you consider us guardians of this city?
Matt: "One of many. I believe the guardians--"
Marisha: Is this because of us?
Matt: Allura looks at you dead-on and says, "The only guardians that Thordak would know of would be the ones that sent him away to that plane 15 years ago. This is my fault."
Liam: That's not true. If we are to solve this situation we cannot hide the truth. I killed Krieg. We killed Krieg. I finished Krieg.
Laura: Krieg was a dragon, Allura.
Marisha: A blue dragon.
Liam: We stumbled upon his lair, reached through his home in Emon, through magical means. We found his lair.
Laura: He attacked us.
Liam: And we-- I--
Marisha: I reach out and I grab Vax's hand.
Taliesin: We survived.
Liam: When it happened, he had four stones, four orbs in his lair. They saw us.
Marisha: They spoke out to us.
Taliesin: They threatened us.
Matt: "When was this? Was this--"
Taliesin: Many years ago.
Marisha: Maybe two years ago.
Liam: Not all that long ago.
Laura: It was right after we got to Emon.
Matt: "It's been over a year at least. Well, if it's taken them that long at least to free Thordak, it means that this was probably in the works for quite some time. If we do share this responsibility, I assure you it weighs heavier on me than it does you. But right now we need all the allies we can gather. Now, you say Thordak is where right now?"
Travis: Sitting on Emon.
Matt: "Within the city?"
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Vex, you would know.
Laura: Oh, I can sense them. Right.
Matt: It's for a six-mile radius, was it?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: On the edge of your senses, you close your eyes and focus and extend your ability to feel the landscape around you. Indeed, The Cinder King still sits in the center of the city.
Laura: He's here.
Matt: "What of the others?"
Laura: Do I sense any others?
Matt: Nope.
Laura: They're gone for the time being.
Travis: It's weird, they do what he says.
Taliesin: Barely.
Liam: And on top of all that, we have this fucking skull.
Marisha: I need to check in with my people. I need to check in with the Air Ashari.
Matt: "Where's the rest? Where's the council? Who do we know survived?"
Laura: We don't know anything. Everyone was dying around us, we made it to the keep.
Travis: It happened very quickly.
Liam: We don't know what happened to Uriel, we didn't see.
Matt: "We need to take stock of who we can consider friends that are still around. We need all allies right now. That should be our first order of business, if anything." And her face drops again. "I just lost my connection with Westruun."
Travis: Oh fuck. The whole world.
Marisha: Yeah, this is an annihilation.
Matt: "This isn't an annihilation, if this was an extermination there wouldn't be any survivors, you wouldn't be here. The fact that they've only taken what they can of the city-- what use is a city to a dragon if it doesn't have worshippers? They're vain beings."
Marisha: Think, Allura, what do all these cities have in common? And what would be the benefits of taking over these cities?
Matt: "Resources, their gold, their people."
Marisha: Do you think they just want domination over people? Over us? They called us ants!
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: They want to be gods.
Matt: "What good is a creature that sees itself as superior if there aren't those around it to tell them as such and confirm the belief, and if anyone refuses to bend to their will through fear and power. That is the nature of the chromatic dragons."
Marisha: There has to be something more that they want.
Matt: "Perhaps, but for now, the fact that he's even shouted mercy at this time as opposed to completely destroying everything in his wake, means that vanity can be used to our advantage. I don't know how soon, but that's something. Now--"
Travis: Allies. Vasselheim has warriors, armories.
Taliesin: Whitestone as well.
Laura: We can bring them here.
Marisha: I need to reach out to the Ashari and see if they're-- I leave, I want to go-- Well, actually; Allura, will you help me in a scrying spell?
Matt: "Yes, yes, the best I can, yes."
Marisha: I want to scry and first check in on the Fire Ashari.
Matt: Okay. All right, at this point she pulls out her crystal ball from a little tiny satchel, which is in itself a smaller Bag of Holding. Pulls out a small mirror, takes some water and pours it on the mirror, places the sphere above it, and it floats for a second. And there's a makeshift scrying ritual site here before you. You guys take about ten minutes to concentrate, and if you guys want to do anything in that ten-minute period, you're welcome to, or if you just want to watch and wait, you can.
Taliesin: I'm going to just sit, it's been a long, long day.
Matt: Okay. The spell completes.
Travis: Can I roll hit dice?
Matt: Yeah, you guys can begin to take a short rest, if you want to heal up.
Liam: I go over to my sister in that time. I want-- I want to kill that dragon. Or I want to die trying.
Laura: We will.
Marisha: Do I see Cerkonos?
Matt: So you take Allura's hand and you put your focus into the crystal sphere, your vision lifts out of the keep with extreme speed. You find your visual surroundings thrust across the Ozmit Sea. You find yourself swooping across the shores of Othanzia, over the forests, eventually coming upon the blackened clouds that perpetually hang above the charred mountain range that contains the home of the Fire Ashari and the entrance to the elemental plane of fire. Your vision crests the mountain and steps into the valley of broken, blackened shale to the ever-burning forest. As you come upon it, you recall where the Fire Ashari village was and where you were greeted before and given your trials. Where there is now nothing but sundered, broken wood, tents, destroyed bodies burned and charred and curled up in horrible ever-gasping pain. The forest itself is flattened from the inside out, like a blast from the center of it just exploded outward, the trees all bent and snapped at the base, and in the center, where there once was that small pool of molten lava that you created the portal through and stepped into the elemental plane, there is a large, ominous, flickering gash between the planes that is roughly 30 to 40 feet in width and height that is pulsing as fire and magma pours out of it. You can see wandering imps and elementals and various entities slowly peeking out and escaping and wandering throughout the mountain tops. From what you can see, there are no signs of any survivors.
Marisha: It destroyed everything. They killed everyone.
Matt: Allura at this point, who pulls out of the ritual, reaches out and grabs you by the shoulders.
Marisha: We failed.
Matt: And she looks you in the eyes, and for a moment you feel like her normally warm and embracing face has gone cold and intense and her voice seems to echo with an undercurrent of arcane focus and volume. She goes--
Marisha: My people failed, we failed our cause.
Matt: "Keyleth, you failed no one, this is not your doing. This burden is ours as a people to hold, do not let this wash over you or he wins. This is their making, this is not yours. These creatures are evil incarnate, and it is our job, our true calling to end what they have done. Do not let this crush you, you are stronger than that. Pull yourself together. Your people, those that remain, they stand behind you."
Marisha: I'm not as strong as you, Allura.
Matt: "But you can be and you will be. Do you trust me? Do you trust me?"
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "Good." Her grasp releases.
Marisha: That's my people.
Matt: "And mine, and all of ours. There are many secrets in these lands. I'm a firm believer that there's always a way to victory, if we are smart about it and if we're quick about it. Now, I think we should look for survivors. Gather those we know that can rally to our cause, in Emon and beyond. What say you?"
Taliesin: Aye.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Aye.
Liam: We are to stand now or we might as well be dead.
Laura: So we're definitely not going to wish on this skull then, yeah?
Matt: "I would recommend against it."
Marisha: Yeah, I stand.
Matt: "Very well, let us prepare for the fall of the Chroma Conclave. Together." And that's where we'll end our session for tonight.
Laura: Fucking A!
Matt: Hey guys, D&D's fun! (laughter)
Marisha: D&D will never be fun again; everything's ruined.
Liam: Hey, we're all cows! (laughter)
Marisha: Back when things were so much simpler.
Liam: Be sure to buy a t-shirt over on geekandsundry.com.
Travis: Wow.
Liam: In Sam's honor.
Laura: What in the hell.
Taliesin: Brought to you by Wyrmwood Gaming. Specifically designed to absorb tears. (laughter)
Marisha: Ah yes, thank you. It's so porous.
Matt: So yeah.
Ashley: Can we play longer?
Travis: Can we play longer?
Matt: Aww.
Marisha: What time is it? It's ten o'clock, and we ended on time and--
Laura: That's the first time we've ever ended on time.
Liam: Wow, that game felt like 20 hours.
Travis: Yeah. Originally this was supposed to be a three-hour show, but it never quite made it that way.
Matt: I know we tried, we try and mostly fail, but occasionally we get it right. So, I mean, I'd say I'm sorry for the emotional rollercoaster, but no.
Travis: The was fucking awesome.That was awesome, aside from the death.
Taliesin: I would have kicked your ass, by the way, just throwing that out there. I picked up the poker because I didn't want to hurt you. (laughter)
Travis: All right, okay.
Taliesin: Throwing that out there.
Liam: My plan was to take that skull and run like a fucking football player and fucking go for the goal.
Taliesin: Flash Gordon.
Liam: Yeah. I would have been in the heart of Emon. Shoving it up the red dragon's nose.
Matt: Well. Welcome to the new story arc.
Laura: Oh jeez. (cheering)
Laura: Everything changed.
Matt: Yeah. Oh man.
Laura: Everything.
Taliesin: When do I level up?
Marisha: I'm going to find a corner to rock back and forth in.
Liam: We would have been working in a lich's sugar mine if you'd done that.
Travis: Nah, we all would have been kings and queens, we would be drinking iced mochas.
Marisha: I was more afraid of us wishing ourselves out of existence. I wish there were no more dragons... and no more people and no more--
Taliesin: It was such a bad deal, I said no. Like, can you imagine how bad of a deal that must have been?
Liam: That's a good point.
Taliesin: I was really looking for a reason to say yes.
Marisha: And it turns out that it was just a fucking lame-ass pirate. Fuck that, we don't want to be indebted to some shithead pirate.
Taliesin: Nothing good happens when you let Mxyzptlk out of the goddamn skull.
Matt: It was fun. I set a time for myself when she's gonna arrive, and I was like, "Oh man, what's going to happen before she gets there?" I was like, as you guys kept delaying it, they might actually-- she might actually catch them in time.
Marisha: She would have walked in and we're beating the shit out of each other.
Laura: It all would have gone to hell if--
Matt: You don't know what would happen. You don't know.
Travis: I would have saved the world, that's what would have happened. Fucking one.
Matt: None of you have heard of a githyanki in your travels.
Travis: I would have been King Grog, I would have gotten a cave, I would had a bunch of harem people taking care of me, giving me sponge baths with their tongues.
Liam: I was going to carve my name in your nuts.
Travis: I would object to that.
Taliesin: I was going to gender swap, I wanted-- Percy was going to become Percina. (laughter)
Marisha: I wish I was a woman.
Marisha: We still have the dragon problem, but now have the dragon and a pirate.
Matt: There you go-- the de Rolo sisters-- Glad you could make it, Ashley. (cheering)
Matt: You should make it every week.
Marisha: Does this mean I'm the last druid to make the Aramente?
Matt: You don't know.
Taliesin: There might have been one after you.
Laura: There's got to be other ones.
Matt: From what you saw, the Fire Ashari were decimated, you saw a number of bodies, you don't know if any escaped, you don't if any were hidden, you don't know what happened. At that location, it is desolation, and you get the sense from that, that is precisely the place where Thordak came through the plane.
Marisha: I'm wondering about the other locations, though, too.
Taliesin: I want to know about Whitestone. We have a lot a phone calls to make.
Marisha: We have a lot of phone calls. Like I--
Travis: They're all dead, everybody's dead.
Marisha: Theoretically wiped my people off the face of the planet.
Matt: Such an optimist.
Marisha: If they all busted through--
Taliesin: Does decimate mean that 1/10 survived? Or that only 10% died? I can never remember which one decimated is. I know it's one of the two.
Matt: Yeah, that term has been largely misused in the current-day vernacular.
Taliesin: I know. 10% died, that's what it is.
Travis: I love misusing vernacular.
Matt: It's fun. You guys--
Travis: Great fucking story Matt, holy shit. Holy shit, you had trees and stuff.
Taliesin: Why do you got to be a dick, man?
Matt: As we're discovering the white battlemats don't pick up as well on the camera as the colors, I'm trying to use other options whenever possible.
Travis: It works. The green was amazing.
Laura: It was really cool with green.
Matt: So I'm going to try and push more on that. A little more work on my end, but it'll be fine.
Liam: Tell me more, sadist.
Laura: Thanks for joining us, you guys.
Matt: You guys, thank you for watching, and hope you have a wonderful night, and we'll see you guys next Thursday. Good night!
Marisha: I need a cigarette, and I don't smoke.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons, roll dice, and stuff. Tonight is a special episode; it's a special 50th episode. We've made 50 of these! To kick off the evening's festivities before the game, we want to show our first big present to you guys, something we've been working on for about a little over a month. We hope you guys enjoy it. Let's go ahead and have a look at the new full intro for Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back, guys! (cheering)
Matt: That was fun! We've been silently working on that for a long time.
Marisha: It was so hard to keep secret.
Matt: I know. Every edit that came in was awesome. Yeah, we all went together in Simi Valley for a day and shot, and did wonderful photos, which we actually have wallpaper going up tonight!
Laura: That is correct. It'll be going up very soon.
Marisha: I guess I could go right--
Laura: Do it now, he just said it!
Liam: We're doing it live! We're doing it live.
Sam: We're releasing a special 50th episode wallpaper all for you guys to use on your home PCs.
Marisha: On the Critical Role Twitter and Facebook right now.
Sam: Download it!
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: Download it, @criticalrole.
Liam: Good, pressure's off.
Marisha: It's done.
Matt: It's all over. Episode's over. No, thank you guys for coming tonight. Hope you enjoyed that. We have some really awesome people that helped out with that. I'm going to go ahead and get some thank-yous here. We have, first off, a big thank you to Jan-Michael Losada, our DP for that shoot; Pamela Joy who did all the incredible photography, and Loretta Richert, both of them helped us find and secure the location and shot an incredible series of photos that we'll be using in upcoming episode releases and promotional stuff! So check that out. You guys have been amazing, thank you so much. Next up, I want to go ahead and thank Dave and James Codeglia who are from Ghostlight. They did all the special effects you see as well as the color grading and the editing. They did a phenomenal job on this, and big thanks to you guys. It's far more than I ever expected it could be. Ghostlight is awesome.
Travis: Are we cutting to that title camera so they can see the addresses?
Matt: Yeah. For makeup we want to thank Misti Dawn, Talor Bianca Appice, and Heather Galipo, they did an amazing job. And Travis, of course, for sitting in the makeup chair for a long time.
Travis: It was cold (laughs). It was real cold.
Marisha: Four hours! Specifically, Misti did a lot of our beauty makeup, Bianca did Travis, and Heather did all of our ears. Because ears take a lot of time!
Matt: You guys did an amazing job. Next up, for our illustrious costumers, we have Jessica Dru, who did an amazing job, Jessica Dru Johnson for selling me the costumes, Vanessa Walton, who made your wonderful headpiece--
Marisha: Yes, and she has an Etsy store, actually Creature of Habit on Etsy. So follow her on Instagram and of course you can go-- she makes all these amazing flower crowns; she's basically a real-life faerie.
Taliesin: It's a magical Instagram.
Marisha: It is a magical Instagram, Creature of Habit.
Matt: Check that out. And of course Bryan Forrest for both applying a lot of the armor to Pike and a lot of individuals here. He brought a lot of the great costume pieces and armor, and was one of our illustrious goblins; he got killed as two different goblins! Took two arrows, one in the face, one in the chest. A great stuntman, Bryan, thank you so much for helping out with that.
Marisha: Thank you Bryan, we love you!
Matt: Jon Enge who was our special effects supervisor on set and was the goblin who got stabbed in the back. He was amazing.
Marisha: And he's got a youtube channel, Mars Rising, which is great. And I did a Splinter Cell guards sketch that I did with him a while ago
Taliesin: He and I used to perform at the Ren Faire together, it was a thing.
Marisha: Oh! That's awesome; Jon's awesome. Go check his stuff out.
Liam: You worked at Ren Faire?
Taliesin: Oh, shut up. Suck it.
Travis: Lord Taliesin!
Matt: Of course, Jason Charles Miller, who's a friend of the show, who's been on the show as Garthok the half-orc rogue, did the new theme, as well as the old one, but he re-upped for the new theme, extending it and making it that much more epic. Thank you so much. And Geoff Bisente did a lot of the sound design on it as well. You guys kicked ass on making it sound as good as it did. Check out their stuff, they're amazing. I think Jason should have the actual new song up on iTunes soon in case you want it for a ringtone or something. And last but certainly not least, we have Avery Faeth, who did the amazing Percy costume.
Taliesin: My coat! She's an amazing coat designer. She's got a--
Marisha: She's a coat designer.
Taliesin: She did the coat, she's an amazing cosplayer and costume designer and you can find her on Sickhorse all over the place.
Matt: And Kai Norman, who you've seen on the show, he actually did our casts of the K'Varn horn, and his incredible work. He did Percy's gun. He did a number of the props we used for it, he's great. You can find him at @KommissarProps. Additional costuming done by Anne Valiant, who did an amazing job helping us out getting the costume pieces we needed for it. As well, a big shout-out to Labyrinth of Jared at Masquerade Ball who also helped provide a lot of the costumes for the shoot, and Sword and the Stone who helped provide a lot of the weaponry and armor, along with Bryan. So thank you guys, all of you so much, for helping make this happen. We're really excited and we hope you liked it!
Travis: Can you put the first one up again, because we didn't get the Pamela Joy title-- yeah. It's the only one we missed. They were so instrumental and did such a lovely job.
Laura: Yeah they did!
Marisha: And Pam did the photo of the wallpaper.
Laura: She's actually shot all of our photos from the very beginning. She's freaking amazing.
Travis: We have so much, you guys, so much.
Marisha: Go follow her on Instagram! She's great.
Matt: All right. So getting into our actual announcements here, try and cruise through this as fast as possible.
Sam: It's our special episode; I thought everyone was dressing up.
Laura: We're all wearing our shirts
Marisha: You're appropriate for Scanlan.
Sam: You all look like shit!
Liam: Sam, can I show you my snake? (oohing and aahing)
Travis: Bigger than I thought it'd be!
Matt: Strangely, he lost it for a few sessions.
Liam: This too shall pass.
Matt: All right, so  50th episode, guys! (cheering)
Matt: Can't believe we made it this far! And more to come. 50 more! Hopefully.
Liam: Hey look! Ashley's here!
Ashley: Hey! I just landed. Not landed in a plane, but just drove in.
Matt: Drove all across the country, from New York.
Ashley: From, yes. Drove in from New York.
Laura: So what does that mean, Ashley?
Ashley: I'm here for a little while. (cheering)
Marisha: She's back!
Ashley: I'm back for a little bit.
Travis: Yay, Pike!
Ashley: Probably for a couple months, a few months, we'll see. We're pushing it for a few months.
Marisha: That sounds better.
Ashley: I'm excited and I'm nervous, but I'm excited.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: I'm so glad you could join us, and welcome back, Ashley.
Ashley: Thanks. Thank you.
Matt: Also tonight we're putting up for the next two weeks on pre-order a brand new set of "How Do You Want To Do This" hoodies, which I'm wearing here.
Laura: It's Alternative Apparel and it's super-duper-super-duper cozy inside.
Travis: Look at that! Look at that.
Ashley: That's so softy-puffy.
Marisha: They're super soft.
Laura: You could use it as a pillow, you could use it as a hoodie.
Ashley: You could wear it on a plane.
Sam: Where are all the other places they could wear it?
Ashley: On a train.
Laura: Dinner, you could wear it to dinner.
Taliesin: You could wear it in a boat!
Sam: With a goat?
Taliesin: You could put it on a goat.
Marisha: To Big Lots.
Taliesin: At work or on the go.
Liam: Keep this going all night long.
Matt: Two hours.
Sam: It's this content that you've demanded. (laughter)
Matt: So yeah, these are up on the store, or should be, and will be up for pre-order for the next two weeks. If you want one, get one! Because they're cool. I like them.
Travis: Yeah, we all have one.
Matt: Indeed. All right, next up, Critmas is tonight. So we got that coming up after the show.
Laura: Just a few packages.
Marisha: Yeah, just a few cartloads
Matt: We're going to do our best to keep it as organized and as expedient as possible so we can get to bed at a decent hour, especially those of us who have like 8:00am call times in the morning. Travis.
Travis: I'm going to stay as long as I can.
Matt: (laughs) But yeah, so stick around for that. You get to watch us all cry forever, because that's what happens every time.
Travis: Cry forever.
Matt: A couple other announcements  has here on the list "posters."
Travis: Posters?
Liam: Posters?
Sam: Posters?
Matt: Posters. Somebody must've put that on the list.
Liam: Maybe later.
Sam: What's a poster?
Liam: There's four of them on a bed.
Matt: There you go, that makes sense.
Taliesin: If somebody says they're one thing but really they're just not all that.
Matt: That makes sense. Quick announcement, an event coming up: a convention on May 26 to 29 in Atlanta called MomoCon. I will be a guest at that, so all you east coast folks around Atlanta come say hello! I have panels, and talks, and autographs to give, and cool artwork you can pick up. So yeah, MomoCon, May 26-29, hope to see you guys there. Me and Marisha are both announced to be guests at the Haven Expo in Mackay, Australia on July 2nd, so all you folks in the outback, you'll want to come hang out with me and Marisha at the beginning of July.
Ashley: (Australian accent) In the outback!
Matt: Just like that.
Ashley: (accented) Going to get a bloomin' onion?
Matt: I'm so sorry.
Laura: I'm sure they're really thrilled about that.
Matt: She's back for ten minutes, guys.
Ashley: I know a lot of Australians.
Sam: You've already offended an entire continent.
Matt: You and Johnny Depp in the same week, come on. So yeah, hopefully we're looking forward to seeing a bunch of you guys down under at the beginning of July. Let's see, reveal secret Scientology message and ascend to Xenu, that's on the list. We got that one situated.
Taliesin: Who put this one together?
Matt: Rat Queens! The next Rat Queens issue coming up. 16, I guess? Issue 16 is the number? Has a series of pages in which all of Vox Machina have a wonderful cameo.
Sam: It's amazing. We're in a comic book. We did it.
Taliesin: Has that not publicly been seen yet, is that not out yet?
Sam: Some pictures have been, but not all of it.
Marisha: We have transcended, you guys.
Taliesin: We are fiction now.
Ashley: That's so crazy.
Matt: Yeah. Isn't it? One more thing I want to mention: a really great game called Masquerada; I play the lead character, Cicero Gavar. It's been developed by a great studio named Witching Hour. They put up a Kickstarter today to see if they can make the game as good as it possibly can be-- that final push. As an independent/indie studio and an indie product, they're putting out a phenomenal isometric RPG. Great voice talent that includes Jennifer Hale, Dave Fennoy, it's a great cast. Check it out on Kickstarter if it's something you think you'd be interested in, and possibly helping them polish it and make it phenomenal. So check that out. Anything else you guys want to announce?
Liam: Yeah! Can I get a CritRole?
All: CritRole!
Liam: Boy, I always love sitting at the table with my dice and having a nice cozy wooden box to keep my dice in. Wyrmwood Gaming makes all kinds of wooden boxes to hold your dice in. We have them here, we have all kinds. There's these, there's these-- they hold dice!
Sam: Those seem really remarkable, Liam.
Ashley: Wait, what is this one?
Sam: Is there anything any bigger?
Liam: In due time.
Liam: Wyrmwood Gaming, you know them already because we talk about them non-stop, friend of the show. If you use the code CritRole, you'll get free shipping. Also Wyrmwood Gaming has a kickstarter up this month for their Sentinel box, which holds--
All: Ooh!
Ashley: What is this?
Liam: It holds your cards, it holds your dice, there's a bluetooth doohickey in it so you'll never lose your box with dice and cards. And you can get all kinds of woods, there's all kinds of tiers, you can get the Critical Role logo etched into any kind of box that they have. And if you want to go full wizard you can get the shnazzy Masterworks box, did I get that right?
Laura: It is masterworks.
Ashley: I want that one!
Travis: I think that's one of the Vestiges.
Liam: So, check it out. Wyrmwood Gaming, they got a Kickstarter, they got a website. They're our good buddies.
Matt: All right. So, anything else anyone wants to talk about or mention?
Marisha: I mean.
Matt: Because if not, I think we may have to watch that intro again. (cheering)
Travis: Yeah, yeah, do it again! Do that shit again, please!
Matt: Let's watch that intro again. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. I remember writing the script for that and going, "We're going to have to cut all this." And then we didn't. I'm so happy how it turned out.
Marisha: Mainly because we ran out of time.
Matt: Like, "Well, we got to do it. Make it work."
Taliesin: "There's no time to do anything else, other than this."
Matt: "We can't cut the tentacle creature. I don't know how we'll do it, but it's in there." Let's go ahead and bring us back into the realm of Exandria and catch us up to what happened last time. Vox Machina, a group of adventurers currently on the path to try and usurp and destroy the Chroma Conclave, a collection of chromatic dragons that have torn through Tal'Dorei and currently reign supreme over the partially ruined cities that dot the landscape. The largest of them, and apparently the leader, Thordak the Cinder King sitting in the main city of Emon, forcing you guys to flee. You've gone about and discovered these artifacts, these legendary items known as the Vestiges of Divergence. Ancient magical weapons and equipment from the last great war, the Divergence. And these seem to be a key in which you can ascertain a level of power and a means of destroying these creatures. Upon seeking information about these, you traveled south to the Frostweald, where you battled a camp of orcs, freeing survivors from Westruun's attack, and managed to walk your way into the deep den of a forgotten Ioun temple where Osysa, the sphinx's mate, resides. After traversing past traps and puzzles you made your way to the main chamber in which the nameless sphinx demanded you reveal that you have earned its name. During this battle you traveled through portals to other elemental realms to seek out the information to hopefully devise the title of this sphinx before it was too late. During which, Grog leapt through, if I recall, one of these portals into the Elemental Plane of Air. Set adrift without a means of returning, he took his Chain of Returning, attached it to Craven Edge, and threw it through the portal. It found purchase and you pulled yourself through, face-to-face with Pike, with the blade embedded in her abdomen. The weapon, which had achieved its maximum strength potential of devouring the essence of others, transformed during this battle and has been in its rather intense and dangerous form since. You guys managed to piece together the name of this sphinx, at which point the battle ended and it presented to you the information you required. It gave you the information of the Vestiges that still exist, to its knowledge, and you were escorted via immediate sandstorm out of the temple and now stand at the edge of the Stormcrest Mountains and the Frostweald Forest itself. So. You all take a moment to gather your thoughts, think over what just transpired, and think on your next course of action.
Laura: Well, I want that bow. (laughs)
Marisha: I heard a few things that seemed very desireable.
Liam: How is Pike?
Sam: Yeah, Pike, are you alive?
Ashley: I-- yes. (laughter)
Laura: He healed us all up before we left, right?
Ashley: He healed us. Yes, I'm fine! I'm fine.
Matt: Well, not completely, you guys healed from a couple of spells that were cast at the time, but you haven't had a rest.
Marisha: But some of us are still older, right?
Matt: Indeed.
Liam: Is your stomach closed?
Laura: Yeah?
Matt: You go and inspect the armor itself, the plates that separated and scraped from the impact of Craven Edge's blade. The wound itself seems to have at least stopped bleeding as part of the healing magic and the wound has closed, though you're still in a relatively damaged state post-battle. You guys haven't had really a moment to recover and heal what you could. She seems to be okay. There's still that lingering sweat from the stress and the impact of the blade, but nothing seems to be mortally endangered about her current state.
Liam: Do you need a moment, do you need to speak to Sarenrae?
Ashley: I think I'm okay. Do I know what hit points I'm at?
Matt: Yes. You're at 63.
Ashley: I'm doing okay.
Laura: What time is it?
Matt: Right now, from the time it took you guys to go through the temple and the strangeness that is the shift of time around the temple, it's probably mid-day. Pretty much the same time you entered the temple.
Marisha: Weird.
Travis: I'm really sorry about that.
Ashley: Hey, it's okay, Grog. I know you didn't mean to.
Travis: No. No, I didn't. I was floating away, you should've seen the inside. It was wind everywhere.
Ashley: It sounds pretty crazy.
Travis: Yeah. And I was like, what would my buddy Pike do? She would take the sword and attach the chain to it and throw it through the door! And then you were there!
Ashley: It's okay, Grog! I'll be fine.
Travis: Yeah, but you're my best buddy!
Ashley: Oh, Grog.
Travis: Do you want one of my healing potions, are you sure you're all right?
Ashley: I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be okay. I think if we just-- (laughs) I'm excited to see you guys. (laughter)
Ashley: I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be okay.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Are we taking a rest? I don't know how many--
Laura: It's mid-day!
Taliesin: I think a short rest would not be a bad idea.
Marisha: I don't think this is actually the time of day, I don't think nature works the same around this temple.
Travis: What do you mean? It's magic time of day?
Marisha: Kind of, but it's always magic time of day.
Laura: So maybe we should hang out in the mouth of the cave and take a short rest
Marisha: I'm all right with that.
Laura: Yes?
Ashley: I would be okay with that.
Matt: Ashley, you've used a 5th-level spell. How many 4th-level spells do you have, because you used two I believe?
Ashley: Three 4th-level.
Matt: So you have one left.
Laura: Maybe we should take a long rest.
Marisha: We could try and hoof it home.
Taliesin: I think we start moving in that direction and when nightfall comes we make camp.
Travis: Towards the campsite?
Laura: Unless I was healed, and I don't remember being healed, I'm at 11 health points. So I'm feeling a little sore.
Ashley: Oh gosh!
Sam: He only healed a couple of us.
Marisha: I thought she was the one that he--
Laura: He healed me back to my age.
Matt: Yeah, the aging effect was restored, but only to her. The rest of you are still aged up based on the effect of the lair of the sphinx.
Marisha: That's something we're going to have to Restoration away.
Travis: Please, I'm handsome as fuck right now, come on.
Laura: Did you get aged?
Travis: Like a fine wine. Yeah, I got aged.
Ashley: Can you do Greater Restoration on a group?
Matt: No, on an individual each time.
Ashley: Who is the oldest?
Travis: Well, she was.
Laura: I was and he healed me.
Liam: Typically Scanlan is the oldest, but I've been aged the most maybe.
Laura: He's really fucking old right now. Look at all those wrinkles.
Ashley: How old are you?
Laura: His ears are starting to droop!
Matt: If I recall, you aged close to roughly 20 to 25 years.
Ashley: You look like a fine wine, you just got better with age.
Liam: I knew that this was coming, I just thought I had more years until it happened.
Ashley: They gray looks great on you, the salt and pepper hair.
Marisha: You should really look at this as a nice peek into the future. It's not bad.
Liam: Yeah, so--
Ashley: Would you like to be younger?
Travis: Young again?
Ashley: Would you like to be young again?
Liam: It's probably a good idea.
Laura: Are you sure you want to do it, Pike, are you sure?
Liam: You could do it tomorrow, could you take care of my sister first, Pike?
Ashley: Yes. We need to get you into better order, okay? All right, where we at here?
Travis: Oh, I don't cast that.
Liam: Give her the works.
Marisha: So, we are taking a short rest? I'm going to burn a couple of hit dice.
Laura: Shorty rest and then we'll walk.
Matt: Everyone taking a short rest?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: Yes?
Travis: (emphatically) Yes.
Ashley: I'm going to heal her up.
Laura: I mean, I could roll my own hit dice.
Ashley: No, no, it's my job.
Travis: So I lose all the buffs, right?
Matt: Here's what happens. So as you guys are taking a rest, you step a little bit away from the group, sit down and hold the blade. Chain's still attached across your lap. Just look down at it and you can see it's still pulsing with the power of all the life energy that it'd taken before. And as you take a moment, see to your wounds, relax, recover from the intense rage and all the emotional pain that's transpired here, the blade begins to shrink. You hear the slight crackle (squeal) as the metal begins to creak and pull backward, all the jagged edges pulling into the central singular curved blade at the front of it. As it hits, it seems to almost shrink slightly smaller than it was before and the metal creaks for a second and a voice in your head goes, (breathes heavily) "Hungry--" Make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Oh shit. Now it's going to steal his strength.
Travis: Natural 20.
Marisha: What?
Liam: Eat it, sword.
Matt: For but a moment, you sense a very similar feeling, one that-- it's been really since the battle with K'Varn when all of the light in the world vanished for a second and darkness took your consciousness, and that same cold sensation starts to stem from the blade itself like it's actually trying to pull you into it, and you resist it. And you stand there and look at the blade and it just-- in comparison to its larger form, it looks small. It's the same size it was since you originally got it, but you look at it there in this long, still silence as you try and conjecture what just transpired. And in that silence you hear the voice once again go, "Feed. Now."
Travis: I don't have anything to feed you.
Matt: "Find something."
Travis: (exhales) All right, all right, all right. What?
Laura: Who you talking to, Grog?
Travis: I'm so hungry. My stomach's rumbling.
Sam: Don't we have our cold pack of food?
Marisha: We do and we have some boar meat.
Laura: Yeah, sure.
Ashley: Or some chicken?
Laura: Yeah I did, I think I did take quite a bit of chicken.
Sam: Love me some chicken.
Matt: As you open the freezer chest there's a (poof) of chicken-scented smoke and mist that vanishes.
Laura: Aw, the chicken, we can't take it. That's okay, I've got boar meat. Do you want to feed your stomach the boar meat?
Travis: What? My stomach?
Ashley: Yeah, are you hungry?
Travis: Yeah, I would not turn down some delicious boar.
Laura: I'll mark it down to half the boar meat is gone now, you guys.
Sam: Wow, he's a big eater. That was a lot. That was a whole boar.
Laura: Well, he's a big guy.
Liam: You're a good hunter, though, it's not really--
Laura: That's right. Well?
Taliesin: We can find some more boar if we have to.
Sam: If we're rested, are we going to set off again?
Matt: You guys can use your hit dice if you want to, to heal up.
Travis: Do I get a level of exhaustion back or no? Long rest?
Matt: No, long rest for your exhaustion.
Travis: Fuck!
Ashley: So short rest means--
Liam: That sword is an asshole.
Sam: Be honest.
Travis: That should've been at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Yeah, should've been at disadvantage.
Matt: Roll again.
Marisha: Oh fuck! No!
Taliesin: Do it!
Laura: You have to roll again?
Sam: He's exhausted.
Ashley: Fuck!
Marisha: No! You're lying!
Sam: What is it?
Taliesin: It's a one. He rolled a one.
Liam: (high-pitched) What are the odds?
Travis: 5% both times.
Liam: Everybody roll for initiative
Laura: No joke, though!
Matt: As you guys finish your rest, and you're all gathering the next stage of your advancement, you watch as Grog stands up and starts walking into the snow of the forest with the blade out, topples and falls to one knee, then falls face-first in the snow.
Sam: (yells)
Ashley: Grog? I run over to him.
Laura: We all run out.
Sam: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matt: He's still, he's cold, there are no signs of life.
Liam: Roll him over, roll him over! Grog!
Laura: I slap him across the face.
Liam: Yeah. Punch him across the face. Grog! Pike?
Sam: Heal, heal, heal!
Ashley: I grab the sword and I take it off of his-- away from him, off of his person.
Matt: Okay, you pull the blade and you take it and you shove it off, and the chain's still attached to the side of his arm. You have to pull-- make a strength check.
Liam: Use those gauntlets.
Laura: Oh yeah, 19!
Ashley: What do I-- roll the 20?
Matt: And add four to it.
Ashley: 11?
Matt: 11, that's enough. You (clink) and you pull the chain off the side of his forearm, toss the blade and it (scrapes) skids to a stop in the snow, cutting a shallow swath through the little bit of the embankment. Grog's still rolled on his back, eyes just dead, lifeless.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Pike is it the sword, is it the sword?
Ashley: I feel like it's the sword, I mean we all know that sword has been weird.
Laura: Can you Greater Restoration him?
Ashley: Yes, I'll Greater Restoration on Grog.
Marisha: While she does Greater Restoration, I want to go over and--
Liam: Break it.
Laura: Don't break it!
Marisha: -- grab the sword and see-- yeah, actually, can I do like a--
Sam: Don't--
Marisha: What?
Sam: Don't break it.
Marisha: Why not?!
Sam: His soul could be inside of it
Laura: What do you mean, his soul could be inside of it?
Sam: I touched the sword, it spoke to me, it craves strength from other beings
Marisha: Wait, what do you mean it spoke to you?
Matt: Here's my question to you, Pike. What spells do you have?
Ashley: Okay, so short rest--
Matt: Short rest doesn't give you any spells back. What level spells do you have still?
Ashley: I have a 5th-level. I have one 5th-level, which is Greater Restoration.
Matt: Right, you have Greater Restoration as an option there. What other spells do you have prepared?
Ashley: Aw, shit. I mean, Cure Wounds? No, that's not going to do anything.
Matt: Because from your knowledge and experience, Greater Restoration removes serious curses, it removes avenues--
Ashley: But wouldn't that be--?
Matt: Grog, though you are having a hard time coming to terms with it, in the back of your head there's a part of you that knows that right now, Grog in the snow is dead.
Ashley: Oh no!
Liam: Where can we take him, where can we take him?
Laura: How can he be, how can he be dead?
Liam: Can we take him to Gilmore, can we take him to--?
Marisha: Scanlan, what should I do with this sword?
Sam: Don't break it.
Marisha: Should I cast something through it to try and purge whatever it is out of it?
Sam: You could try to do Greater Restoration on the sword to see if that would somehow free the soul from it or--
Marisha: I can do like a Sunbeam spell, that's like a light spell.
Liam: Who could we take him to, could we tree to Gilmore?
Laura: He wouldn't know anything about these-- Can we go back in?
Marisha: I didn't bring anything because we decided to hoof it.
Laura: What about going back to Kamal?
Marisha: I didn't bring a transportation spell because we decided to walk.
Laura: No, but he's right inside the cave, what if he knows things? The sphinx!
Sam: The sphinx-- yeah. We could go to the sphinx.
Ashley: I have Heal, I have one 6th-level.
Matt: Heal? Heal restores damage or damaged flesh to living entities.
Laura: Me and Scanlan go back into the cave and search for Kamal again.
Taliesin: I'm grabbing the sword and taking it to a corner and I'm going to stare at it for a second.
Matt: Okay. What are you doing, you're going to...?
Laura: Me and Scanlan take flight and we go back in and we try to find Kamal again.
Matt: Okay. You guys cruise into the cavern and as you sit inside where the stairs were that led into the temple, it's solid stone.
Laura: Shit!
Matt: There's no sign of an entrance whatsoever to this temple.
Ashley: Wait, wait. I have Revivify!
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Learned?
Ashley: Yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Has it been enough time?
Ashley: You touch a creature that has died--
Matt: Within the last minute.
Laura: Has it been a minute? He just did it, it just happened!
Taliesin: It's barely been a minute of real time.
Laura: We just ran over!
Ashley: I wasn't even looking at my 3rd-levels.
Matt: Ashley, go ahead and roll an initiative check.
Ashley: Oh, goodness. Okay.
Taliesin: Can I assist with a whisper to the sword?
Matt: Sure.
Sam: Can I inspire her?
Matt: Sure.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: You do first.
Sam: I just hold her hand and I look in her eyes and I just say, "Please, Pike, please. Please. I love him as much as you do. Please."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Take your d10, and if you want to go ahead and use that now or make this as part of the resurrection ritual, which we're now undergoing.
Laura: Oh my god.
Ashley: Can I do this first? Just to see if it works?
Matt: Well, what'd you roll for your initiative?
Ashley: 14.
Matt: 14, okay. You get to his body and his back rolled in the snow looking up, just as that window of time begins to fade for the magic to have any effect. You reach down and you grasp his cold-muscled chest and you find the one singular thread, that little soul thread that's still connected to the essence of his eternal being that once resided within this corpse and you clutch onto it with the magic and hold on to it to begin this ritual. Who wishes to bring something to this ritual? You have hold of the thread right now, you need something stronger to keep him here.
Laura: Is that stupid? (laughs anxiously)
Taliesin: No! It's not stupid!
Laura: Okay, okay. Then I reach into the Bag of Holding and I get out Grog's cask of ale.
Matt: Okay. And--? And what do you do with it?
Laura: Okay. I pour a little in his mouth. Just a little bit, so he doesn't choke.
Matt: (laughing) You reach over and you grab the edge of his beard and pull his mouth open, it's hanging limply. You pull off the cork of the cask and begin pouring it and it spills down the side into the snow, darkening it on the sides of his head.
Laura: I turn his head so he doesn't drown in it.
Matt: Understood. Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: This is so stressful. 16?
Matt: Okay. The ale seems to slide back into the throat and find its way in towards the stomach. There is no swallowing motion whatsoever, but it appears that at least it's not drowning him or blocking his airway. You're clutching onto the spirit here. You only have a few moments left before the magic is lost. Who wishes to--
Liam: While that's going on I walk off 30 feet away and I fall to my knees on the ground facing away. I know you are not what I want. But you are what we need. And I will put aside my reservations and serve you. It is too soon for him, we need him. He is needed. I will set aside my reservations and serve you. Please.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a religion check.
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15. As you're looking up into the frozen boughs of the trees before you, a little bit of snow begins to fall from what was once the still air. It begins to dot the top of your face and touch your nose, and as the first cold singular snowflake hits, your vision goes dark again. In that darkness, you feel your breath go cold as well, and your whole body is locked in place like it can't move. And all you see is the white porcelain face of the Raven Queen step out of the darkness as her hand comes up and touches the side of your cheek. And a voice in your head, a familiar voice, says, "I believe that every death has its place." And the hand lets go and pulls back. Who wishes to make the third and final aid to this ritual?
Sam: Have I already aided by inspiring Pike?
Matt: Well, if Pike wants to go ahead and make a roll of some sort of attempt at this, that would help as Bardic Inspiration.
Sam: But I can't help again?
Matt: If you wish to do your own thing, you can.
Ashley: Just for extra, yeah.
Sam: The sword seems to want power and strength. I don't know if it will help, but maybe if we gave Grog some extra strength it might help him to come back, so. I have a Potion of Fire Giant Strength.
Marisha: I could cast an Enhance Ability spell.
Sam: He has no abilities now, though.
Marisha: That's true.
Sam: So I'm going to pour this Potion of Fire Giant Strength into his gullet.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Hope it gives him some sort of strength.
Matt: Go ahead and make an arcana check.
Sam: Okay. 18.
Matt: 18, okay. As you pour the potion into his throat, the somewhat thick red and yellowish compound that drips from it like a thicker molasses finds its way, mingling with the ale currently in his gullet. You help try and massage it down, like feeding a pill to a dog. As you do, you can see the veins around the shoulders instinctually affected by this, as the flesh itself, you know, the cells are still alive. It's just the nervous system and all else that the lights are currently out on. You hope this is enough. And as you hold onto that singular thread of Grog's existence--
Laura: He's taking a picture
Marisha: Why is he taking a picture?
Sam: Because it's not good.
Taliesin: Because he's a terrible person, that's why he's taking a picture.
Marisha: It's either really good or really bad.
Laura: I know, yeah, it's either really good or really bad.
Travis: I can't hide.
Laura: Matthew!
Marisha: This is bullshit.
Matt: As you're certainly staring at the sword--
Taliesin: I was going to say something to it.
Matt: What do you say to it?
Taliesin: If I were you, I'd put it back. Or else it will be the last meal you ever eat, because I will find an abyss so deep and so far you will never taste a drop of blood again. And I'm not touching it. I touched it and put it down and let go and said that to it.
Matt: The shadow begins to bleed from the blade and rise up and it seems almost like an incensed fury from your words. However, you also hear a raging scream bellow from inside the blade. A familiar yell echoing in distant (roars).
Taliesin: I'll start summoning my own fucking mist, man, I'm not fucking intimidated by this shit.
Matt: Your shadow begins to rise over your back as well. As it begins to coalesce, these two black centers of dark energy facing off in wordless anger and lack of understanding, the arm of Grog's body grabs you by the throat and starts clutching as it sits up and looks you in the face, eyes red with rage, going (growl). Roll a strength check.
Laura: Oh my god!
Sam: Strength check?! He's got 25 strength now!
Travis: Disadvantage still?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: He's going to crush my neck.
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. He manages to close off the windpipe just for a short moment, but in that time the red fades from his eyes and the first inhale of breath (gasps) comes into Grog's chest, and your vision clears. And the moment of confusion hits you as you look around and notice this tiny gnome in your grip, head beet-red as you notice that your thumbs are pressed into his larynx.
Travis: No, no. No. (clears throat) What'd you do to me?
Sam: (gasps) Nothing.
Laura: What the fuck is that sword, Grog?
Sam: Gave you some ale.
Sam: What's with you and gnomes today, man?
Travis: I like gnomes, I don't know! What? Why am I down here?
Marisha: Are we sure it's him? Scanlan? Percy? Percy, are we sure?
Sam: Nope! I'm not sure. I'll do a perception check to see if it's--
Marisha: Can I also do an insight check? Can I assist him or make an insight as well?
Matt: You can make your own insight check.
Sam: 17.
Marisha: Sorry. 23.
Laura: What?
Taliesin: I love a whisper.
Liam: I don't.
Laura: How come he's getting a whisper and you're not getting a whisper? Hey, you guys (sobbing) check out those "How Do You Want to do This" hoodies-- (laughter)
Taliesin: I want to do this with great pain and sadness.
Ashley: This is so stressful!
Laura: Oh my god, you came back and Grog died!
Ashley: I want to go back!
Matt: He rolled a 20, then he rolled a one.
Travis: I did my classic ten-minutes-later remembering-the-rules shit.
Matt: That's right, because you got the third point at the end of that battle because you frenzied for that last fight.
Marisha: Grog! How many fingers am I holding up?
Liam: Six.
Travis: Nine!
Marisha: I think it's him. All right.
Sam: Oh my god.
Laura: Grog, you died!
Ashley: You fell over dead!
Marisha: How many more of us are going to die?!
Travis: No, I didn't. No.
Laura: Yes. You did.
Travis: What, when?
Laura: Pike saved you. Pike brought you back.
Sam: Where's your sword, Grog?
Travis: My sword is-- where is my sword?
Sam: Yeah, exactly.
Ashley: It's not your sword anymore.
Travis: What do you mean?! Wait, wait. Where is my-- where's Craven Edge?
Matt: You sit up and glance over, and you see about 15 feet from you, set up against the bottom of a tree, the blade is currently being crouched over by Percy, his fingers tense, his shoulders and back arched and locked, and you see two shadow sources that are almost on their own subtle plane having a staredown.
Laura: Shit.
Travis: Hey! Hey, Percy! Percy!
Taliesin: Little busy.
Marisha: Do you want to explain this, Grog?
Laura: Can we see what's going on?
Matt: You guys look over and you see this happening, yeah.
Travis: Well, I mean he's obviously messing with other people's property! And I walk over to the sword.
Marisha: No, no, no!
Laura: I run over and I block it. I stand next to Percy and I block the sword.
Travis: What?
Ashley: Yeah, I walk over and I stop Grog.
Liam: I'm pulling out daggers and standing behind my sister. Grog. Grog, let it go.
Travis: Let what--
Liam: This has been something on the tip of our tongue for weeks. Let it go. Whatever that thing is, it's fucked. Let it go!
Travis: But it's my sword.
Marisha: It was never your sword, was it, Grog?
Travis: I mean, Percy gave it to me, but it's mine.
Laura: Percy gave it to you?
Sam: Yeah. Yeah, he let him have it.
Travis: Yeah, we traded. Fair and square.
Liam: What did you say?
Taliesin: Little busy.
Liam: Scanlan, what?
Sam: Grog, listen, when I experienced the sword, it was pretty cool, and it is a powerful, powerful weapon, but after seeing what it's just done to you, I don't think you can have it, man.
Travis: I'm still a bit fuzzy. Like I mean, you know, we fought the sphinx, it got super-gnarly, and then we took a little rest and you-- did you see it shrunk?
Laura: Grog! The sword pulled you into it! You were dead, your soul was with whatever the fuck is in there now.
Travis: Well, how did I get out of there?
Laura: Pike saved you.
Ashley: We brought you back!
Sam: We? It was you, Pike.
Travis: Oh, like just now?
Ashley: It was a group effort!
Travis: Why do I taste ale, and whiskey?
Ashley: Because she gave you a little to bring you back!
Travis: I mean, I didn't know if I'd thrown up in my mouth, and like swallowed it.
Matt: The shadow has now rescinded into the blade.
Taliesin: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yes, Percy?
Taliesin: I'm debating whether or not to touch the sword. And I'm debating whether or not you should touch the sword.
Laura: Nobody should touch the sword, Percy.
Taliesin: We have to move it.
Sam: I've touched it before and it was fine. I can touch it again.
Ashley: Well, I could try to--
Laura: I feel like it's going to try and suck anybody in right now.
Marisha: Well, what should we do with it? We should get rid of it?
Travis: Look, guys, I can carry it at least.
Laura: No.
Ashley: No! You're not going to touch it again!
Taliesin: It's a bad deal.
Liam: Put it in the Bag of Holding and give the Bag of Holding to Pike.
Marisha: Wait, no, we're not putting that in the Bag of Holding. That sounds like a terrible idea. However, let me read something really fast.
Laura: Can we talk to it? I mean, can we see what it is?
Matt: I mean, you see a blade before you.
Laura: The shadow's not there anymore?
Matt: The shadow's pulled back into the blade.
Ashley: Percy, what did you get from it?
Laura: I mean, what did it sound like?
Sam: It sounded evil.
Travis: Well, now, that's really judgmental.
Sam: And also awesomely powerful.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: What were you going to say, Vax?
Liam: de Rolo knew about this. That's perfectly clear. You knew about this too, Scanlan?
Sam: I didn't know what it was. And I wasn't alone in this; I had asked Pike to weigh in and she was thinking about it. Doing more research.
Ashley: That's true.
Marisha: Pike knew about it as well? Wait, how many people knew about this?
Travis: Yeah! Only four of us. Look, it's been a great ally!
Laura: Four out of seven!
Sam: Vax, I assume you have secrets you haven't told us.
Laura: He has a third testicle. It's out. There, I said it!
Liam: That's a great time for a joke. That's a great time for a joke.
Taliesin: Best time for a joke.
Sam: The weird part is it's not in his crotch area.
Ashley: I could try casting Greater Restoration on the sword.
Marisha: I might be able to Banish it.
Taliesin: Can you do that?
Travis: Well, that's a bit strong, don't you think?
Sam: And that's only for a minute.
Marisha: No, I can do a more permanent version of that. I've never tried it before. And it's a 7th-level spell.
Travis: Look, look! Okay. Look, if you get bucked off a horse, right? You don't kill the horse, you just train it up a bit. Let's just work with the sword.
Laura: Horses don't try to steal your soul, Grog.
Liam: Who owned the sword before you had it? Who?
Travis: Ah. Well.
Liam: Find it on the ground?
Laura: Oh. It was Lord Briarwood.
Liam: It's very familiar, that's right. It belonged to the arch-vampire who we fucked up.
Travis: Yeah. Right.
Marisha: And I hate to be the one to point it out, but I feel like you've been almost a little bit more brutal than you usually are here lately, which is almost impressive.
Taliesin: Grog, I'm going to make you a deal. We're going to deal with this as a family, and we're going to get you something much nicer.
Marisha: It just killed you.
Taliesin: Right away. We're going to replace it with something a little less complicated.
Laura: Maybe some bone knuckles? I hear those are pretty badass.
Travis: Bone?
Laura: Giant's bone?
Travis: Titanstone?
Marisha: Maybe a family heirloom?
Taliesin: Perhaps it's time to be a better badass.
Sam: Does, DM, does Suggestion last forever or just for a little amount of time?
Matt: Suggestion, I think it lasts for a short time.
Marisha: I can attempt to Plane Shift this into another dimension.
Laura: No, how about we just wrap it in fabric. No?
Travis: Well look, hey, look, all right, fine, look, I won't touch it. But can we like at least figure out what it was doing? Lord Briarwood had it, I asked it a few questions, like if it knew Vecna. And we just got to see it level up a little bit.
Marisha: What all has it told you, Grog?
Travis: It's always hungry, right, so it likes to be, it likes what I do--
Ashley: Grog!
Travis: What? What, I'm hungry too!
Liam: Show of hands. Who here is uncomfortable with that piece of shit?
Ashley: I mean, it stabbed me, so yeah, I'm uncomfortable.
Travis: I said I was sorry, I really--
Ashley: It's okay. It's not your fault.
Laura: But I do think that whatever it is might know something.
Marisha: Well, Grog said he's been talking to it, which makes--
Taliesin: You don't want to interrogate it, because if we interrogate it we're going to have to make a deal.
Liam: You have to choose between this group and that sword.
Travis: Oh, well I choose the group, I mean, I voted I was uncomfortable as well.
Liam: So what are we arguing about?
Travis: Well, I don't just want to destroy it.
Marisha: It served its purpose. You got its fair use. You got your money's worth, which was free.
Travis: Yeah, but I could use it on Kevdak.
Taliesin: It can use you on Kevdak.
Laura: Do not use it against Kevdak. You don't want something making your strength unnatural when you fight your new foe.
Travis: Well look, the last I remember was it said it was hungry. If it gets hungry again, I'll just give it something to eat.
Marisha: Like one of us?
Travis: No, like my thigh or something.
Laura: You'll chop off your own leg--
Travis: No, I would just stab it.
Marisha: You want to sacrifice your own leg for a sword?
Travis: Kevdak has the Titanstone Knuckles. It's a Vestige that we're looking for, right? It's going to be a hell of a fight, and this is a hell of a sword.
Laura: He's got a Vestige. He's still just him.
Liam: The sword just fucking killed you, you dummy!
Marisha: And you were far powerful before the sword. You killed Lord Briarwood without the sword.
Laura: That's right.
Marisha: The sword didn't make you Grog.
Travis: All right, hold on, Pike. Look. If we're going back to Kevdak. You know I'm not scared of death, right? I would die by a dragon, I would die by a beholder, and I wouldn't care, as long as it was a beautiful death. But I don't want to die from Kevdak. Not him.
Ashley: We'll find you a better weapon. I don't want you to die from something that's not worth it.
Travis: All right. Fine. Do what you want with it. I don't need it.
Taliesin: What do you think we should do with it?
Ashley: We'll find you something strong.
Travis: This is an empty cup.
Taliesin: Oh, we've already poured it into your mouth.
Laura: No, there's a little left in the cask, here. Here's your cask.
Travis: I throw the cup away and just take the cask.
Marisha: All right. Should I attempt to banish this thing forever?
Sam: You can banish something forever?
Marisha: It's called Plane Shift, I can shift it into its own little pocket dimension where it'll stay and nothing else can get to it.
Taliesin: I think I'm perfectly content with it being someone else's problem.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: I'm staring hard to make sure it's not going to fight this.
Marisha: So looking at Plane Shift, it says you can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. But I can also transport eight willing creatures, so can I hold the sword and attempt to Plane Shift it away?
Matt: I don't see why you would not be able to do that to an object, honestly. Especially based on the power of the spell. Where would you want to banish it to?
Marisha: Ooh. Ooh! Ooh!
Liam: Newark.
Marisha: The pocket dimension of the green-eyed boy. The golden-eyed boy.
Matt: Oh!
Laura: The Dread Emperor that we already killed.
Marisha: Yes, it was empty, it was his own dimension and he's dead.
Matt: It was the Dread Emperor.
Taliesin: Well, let's think about this.
Marisha: What?
Sam: What else lives there?
Marisha: Nothing.
Liam: It was an island with child labor, it's full-circle for Keyleth.
Taliesin: I'm going to suggest something that's going to sound a little iffy, but I swear to god I'm being clever. Send it somewhere where it will be content. Let's not anger something. Where do we send vampires?
Marisha: I could easily send it to one of the Nine Hells, where I'm sure someone would be very happy with the new gift they just found.
Laura: No! Somebody could use it.
Marisha: Exactly.
Taliesin: But they would be using it in the Nine Hells. And it's going--
Marisha: Yes, but you forget that all these planes cross over. We have fought many a demon.
Liam: I don't want to send it to the Hells.
Travis: Can I make like one little suggestion that doesn't involve it coming back to me? I had a thought that since Lord Briarwood had it before, that every time it killed it might've been sending that life back to Vecna? But I don't have any proof of that, you know, I just remember being in that room with all the bodies, with the little sphere of-- the little dough button in the middle of the room.
Sam: We could throw it in the sphere.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: No. That might go poorly.
Travis: Or really cool?
Marisha: I mean, does anyone else have any better ideas where to send this thing?
Ashley: What would happen if you threw it into the sphere?
Sam: Vecna would get it, right?
Ashley: It would get, yeah, that would be bad.
Laura: How about you throw it in that pocket dimension and then we can always go to that same pocket dimension and get it if we decide it's bad there.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: That's true. I mean, it's its own little pocket. It's at least blocked off. That we know of.
Laura: Drop it in a thorny patch.
Marisha: I'm going to go for that Dread Emperor dimension.
Liam: Percival? Percy?
Taliesin: Yes?
Liam: You are clever.
Taliesin: I am.
Liam: It doesn't mean you're always right.
Taliesin: I know. I know.
Marisha: And you do have this terrible habit of liking to push problems on other people.
Ashley: You don't think it would work if I tried Greater Restoration?
Laura: Do you have any more 5th-level?
Ashley: I do, I have one more 5th-level.
Laura: Oh, you do?
Ashley: I do.
Taliesin: I don't think so, but what do I know?
Laura: Why not try it? Before we send it.
Liam: We can camp here for the night. We don't have to go anywhere.
Taliesin: That's fair, yes.
Marisha: Wait, you want to do Greater Restoration, why?
Taliesin: On the sword.
Travis: I'm at one hitpoint.
Laura: You're at--?
Taliesin: I'm going to kick myself if I'm right.
Ashley: Okay, hold on a minute.
Travis: I could just take a healing potion.
Marisha: It needs a wielder, Percy.
Taliesin: Does it? All right, let's-- go ahead. I'm curious.
Ashley: First, Grog is at one hit point. Okay? So I'm going to use my 6th-level and I'm going to use Heal.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right. As Pike turns to you, looks you in the eye, clutching her holy symbol of Sarenrae, there's a smile at the corner of her mouth at noticing that her friend is back. Though as tenuous as this argument has been, and you weren't present for the scare that was there, you can see there is a genuine shake to a lot of their fingertips from what has just transpired. She reaches forward and touches you and you immediately heal 70 hitpoints.
Laura: Bam! Shebang.
Travis: (sings) I feel amazing.
Laura: What do you think Greater Restoration will do?
Ashley: I don't know. Because I remember it worked one time on-- didn't we try that on his--
Taliesin: In my mind I have a worst-case scenario, but.
Laura: I'm afraid it will make whatever's in the sword come out.
Marisha: That's what I'm afraid of as well.
Laura: But if it comes out then we can banish it or kill it and--
Ashley: And then he could keep the sword.
Laura: It will be just a useless sword at that point.
Travis: Not if I'm wielding it.
Sam: Something tells me you won't be wielding it.
Taliesin: I'm tempted to ask you to do it just because I would love to be wrong.
Laura: Fucking try it, Pike!
Ashley: Should we try it? Let's try it.
Travis: Yeah, go for it. We've got a backup if there's something wrong.
Matt: So, as Pike turns around from Grog, the softness in her face fades, and the hard jawline of Pike Trickfoot, seafaring gnome cleric, steps across the snow, step by step towards the darkened blade that nearly stole away her childhood friend. Still clutching in one ogre-gauntleted fist the symbol of Sarenrae, your other hand comes out and you can see the shadow begin to spill from the blade as you approach.
Marisha: Pike, be careful.
Sam: I'm going to inspire her again. I'm going to sing a very romantic ballad.
Ashley: Bring it.
Sam: (sings) Oh my little pretty one, my little pretty one, Pike the Gnome-a, oh you make my nipples hum, my nipples hum, oh you make my nipples hum, Pike the Gnome-a. (laughter)
Matt: Take your d10 inspiration.
Liam: All sad and tragic and with gravitas.
Ashley: A d10?
Matt: A d10 inspiration die.
Ashley: That was beautiful, Scanlan.
Sam: I know.
Matt: All right. As you step forward and the shadow begins to emanate from the blade, you focus and concentrate, and as you do, the light of Sarenrae begins to glow from the front of your hand, and as it does, the shadow seems to be cast away, and the blade now stands currently bare before you. You reach out and touch the blade and recite a few words under your breath, and release the energy of the spell into the sword. Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Just roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Oh, that's good.
Ashley: 17.
Sam: You also have inspiration if you need it.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Add your d10 inspiration die to it.
Liam: Yeah!
Ashley: 26. No, wait. Yeah, 26.
Matt: As you reach out and touch the blade, you can feel suddenly the dark, chaotic presence in there. you can see flashes in your mind of an individual, an ancient person. You see flashes in your head of a clamoring for power, a need for attention and wealth. You see a person making a deal with something it didn't understand. You see a flash of a punishment. You see the remnants of their eternal soul bound to a blade. You see themselves cursed with eternal, gluttonous, unending hunger and cast through the ages, the rest forgotten. And you see, just like the singular thread that was holding Grog to his corpse, a dark, dark thread that connects the sword to Grog. And with this spell, you grasp out and clutch it-- and tear it in two. Grog, wherever you're standing, it's like you just got punched in the gut. You're thrown off your feet and land in the snow once again, eyes wide open. All of you freak out because it's just like how Grog fell originally, except for he shoots up, heavy breathing, alive. With that, the blade just snarls in your grasp.
Ashley: (laughs) Oopsie.
Laura: What just happened?
Matt: Grog? That fucking blade ate your soul.
Travis: What?
Matt: You wonder, this entire time, how you could be so foolish to give into something that this whole time has been using you.
Travis: How could I have been so foolish? This whole time, that fucking blade has been using me!
Marisha: Pike, let go, let go. Before it--
Laura: Drop the sword.
Ashley: I'm scared to let go of it.
Marisha: Let go of it!
Matt: (impact) It sits in the snow. Motionless.
Liam: Keyleth?
Marisha: It didn't attach itself to you now, did it, or anything?
Ashley: No. No.
Travis: Yo, guys, update. That sword is totally evil.
Ashley: Grog, what did you think we were telling you?
Marisha: I reach out and I Plane Shift it to the pocket dimension of the Dread Emperor.
Matt: Okay, you reach out and you pick up the blade, and as you grab it in your hand you can hear the voice, "You! I will--" And before it can finish the phrase, you guys watch as a little thin slit within the plane just shutters open, and you have a quick glance at that distant starscape with various broken, slowly floating islands of earth and rock. You see the partially destroyed bramble forest that you once trekked through, and with that, you throw the blade through the small doorway--
Laura: Eat it, Craven Edge!
Liam: (tiny voice) Help meeee.
Travis: Yeah, I'm not cravin' bacon anymore!
Matt: It slams shut and is gone.
Laura: Well? Fingers crossed nobody gets it.
Travis: And there was a dagger that came with it.
Laura: What?
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: What?
Travis: (laughs) I'm fucking with you.
Ashley: Grog.
Marisha: I know how that spell works now! That's nice.
Liam: What do you say we camp here for the night, everybody?
Taliesin: Let's camp here for the night.
Liam: Right in the cave.
Sam: Wait, it's not at night, it's the middle of the day.
Laura: We can just fucking hang out for a day.
Sam: Shouldn't we start walking?
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: No.
Laura: She's out of spells.
Liam: You got a hard-on for adventure, little man?
Sam: I just think we should make headway if we're going to be traveling all day. Grog, do you even have any weapons anymore?
Travis: I'm super exhausted--
Laura: Yeah, he's got so many weapons.
Sam: I could lend you my whip if you'd like.
Travis: No, I'm like Northrop Grumman meets Raytheon in this Bag of Holding, we're good.
Ashley: Since we got rid of Craven Edge, do you want the Gauntlets of Ogre Power back?
Travis: Oh no, I just gave them to you, though.
Ashley: Yeah, but you're the muscle. I take them off and I give them back.
Travis: What about if I trade you, what if I trade you--
Ashley: Are we doing a trade?
Travis: I have Boots of Levitation.
Ashley: Ooh!
Travis: Or I have black iron plate that while wearing this heavy plate armor the bearer gains resistance to any fire damage.
Laura: Ooh! That's good.
Sam: She already has plate armor.
Laura: Yeah, but this one gives her fire resistance.
Ashley: Does it maybe make me quiet as well?
Travis: I bet if you levitate you'd just be floating above the ground.
Liam: Levitate would make her quiet, yeah.
Laura: Does she have to-- in the levitation boots, can you move?
Matt: Levitation, someone has to push you along.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, that's fine, I'll take care of that.
Marisha: Oh my god, we can get like a little kid leash for you.
Laura: We could tie her onto the broom, we could tie her onto the broom!
Ashley: I could be a Pike kite!
Marisha: It'll be like that scene in Inception.
Travis: Yes! We'll discover electricity with you, you're a great conductor.
Ashley: Grog, that would kill me!
Travis: Oh. That's true. Which one you want?
Ashley: All right, I'll take Boots of Levitation. And you get these so you're super strong again.
Travis: I'll take my Gauntlets of Ogre Power back, strength back up to 19.
Liam: It was good times, though, Pike in those gauntlets. That was pretty cool.
Ashley: Hey, I felt real cool punching that chicken that one time. (laughter)
Ashley: One day I'll be strong.
Sam: Well, I think you just cured Grog, saved his life, and got rid of a soul-eating sword, so you're pretty strong.
Ashley: What did you say?
Sam: You killed the sword and saved Grog's life, so I think you're pretty strong.
Ashley: That's true, that's most important.
Travis: Way to go, badass.
Ashley: Hey, thanks.
Travis: No problem, man.
Ashley: Anytime.
Matt: (laughs) All right. So you guys go ahead and take a--
Travis: Long.
Laura: We just short-rested, but now we're going to sleep. It's been a traumatic five minutes.
Taliesin: We were in a time vortex, really it's time to sleep.
Matt: Fair enough. Where're you resting?
Liam: In the mouth of the cave.
Laura: In the mouth of the cave.
Travis: In the mouth of the cave.
Taliesin: No, no, no.
Sam: You guys can sleep wherever you want. I'll be sleeping in my bed.
Laura: Oh, in the mansion, fuck, we'll sleep in the mansion.
Liam: Sorry, you know, it's so new, it's hard to remember--
Laura: --that we have that.
Sam: Yeah. We do have it.
Marisha: Can I blow my last 5th-level spell to Greater Restoration somebody from their age?
Matt: Sure, yeah.
Sam: Oh, do we know? Are we aware that we went under that effect, I mean we just feel different, or how do--
Matt: No, you guys have-- it's one of those things where you felt the impact happen and you saw each other rapidly age for those that were present, and even afterward there's a noticeable effect, so yeah. You would be able to ascertain via those situations, and the time you've had to rest to think over the battle and see that difference. Plus the fact that you watched Vex get cured of that aging effect by the sphinx before you left, that was also the big indicator. So you would be aware.
Marisha: Who wants to go first?
Sam: You can do multiples?
Marisha: No, just one tonight. The rest of y'all have to stay old.
Travis: Take ol' wrinkly-nuts over there. (laughs)
Laura: Triple the wrinkles, triple the nuts.
Marisha: All right, come here, Vax.
Liam: Here I come, ol' wrinkly-nuts.
Taliesin: Can I borrow your broom for a bit?
Laura: You want to work on it? Or you want to fly around?
Taliesin: It's early, I might as well.
Laura: Can I stand next to you while you work on it? Would that bother you?
Taliesin: Only if you want to double the amount of time it takes me to work on it.
Laura: Oh, Percy, I just want to see what you're doing.
Taliesin: All right, it's very boring.
Sam: Wait, are we in the mansion or are we--
Matt: So you guys have all walked into the mansion at this point. Keyleth, you cast Greater Restoration, and you reach out to Vax. And what little bit of crow's-nest wrinkles, crow's feet that have crawled on the side of his face, and a little bit of the grey hairs that began to spray in the side, all revert back, skin tightens, he's back to his normal roguish half-elf average-aged self.
Liam: I am still older than you.
Laura: By like two whole minutes.
Liam: Which means I get to tell you what to do and don't you forget it.
Matt: All right, so all of you guys head into the mansion. Vex, you're helping Percy to the workshop?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay. What're you doing?
Taliesin: Hit dice just restore at the end of the day, correct?
Matt: Half of your spent hit dice is restored.
Laura: I pop Trinket out, of course, so he can hang out. Shake it out. Run around, get some exercise, I feel like an asshole for keeping you in this thing.
Matt: (bear noises) Goes into the kitchen. All right, so as you guys are preparing to rest for the evening, you head down to the workshop.
Taliesin: Yeah, just to work on the broom.
Matt: Okay. Are you aiding?
Taliesin: Sure.
Laura: Sure.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a tinkering check with advantage.
Taliesin: All right. Oh! With advantage. Very nice. It's new now, I have to remember, I got a new number. Natural 20.
Matt: You guys, there are other numbers between these, by the way.
Taliesin: Are there? Are there? LA-New York-LA-New York, sorry, yeah.
Matt: Don't poke the badger, Percy.
Taliesin: I gave it to Ashly this week, it was working fine.
Matt: Yeah, no.
Taliesin: The other Ashly.
Matt: All right, so. You guys work the evening, and though you were uncertain, Vex is actually a very quick learner and is eager to help, and so between bringing tools at your disposal and helping you hold a few places properly during the construction process, you manage to get far more headway than you expected in just an evening's bit of work. You still have probably a couple of days of work before you can actually complete your prototype for this and try it out, but--
Taliesin: Can I at least have the tether done, or is it still in progress?
Matt: The tether for?
Taliesin: For a dex save if you fall off.
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you've gotten that enough.
Taliesin: All right. Can't stabilize yet, but at least there's a-- okay.
Matt: Yeah. At least if there's ever a tumble there's a tether piece that would hopefully have a chance of keeping the broom with you, so.
Laura: Percy? I feel safer already.
Taliesin: Excellent. Yay to a constructive day. That was-- you're quite good at this, we should do this again sometime.
Laura: I would love that.
Taliesin: Yes, this was actually agreeable. All right.
Travis: I'm in the training room in my sandpit sleeping bed.
Matt: Which in contemplating over the experiences you've had, you now have access to the full Craven Edge weapon sheet.
Travis: The full one?
Ashley: That's a scroll.
Matt: Just so you know what it had done.
Laura: What it had done to you?
Travis: Oh, fuck you! (laughter)
Travis: (high-pitched) Okay.
Laura: Can I see, can we see it?
Travis: No.
Laura: Why? Come on.
Taliesin: I'm so excited.
Ashley: All I just saw was "dark aura" in really dark letters.
Travis: No, no, I can make really good origami now. Can I try and take out the flaming warhammer, the Firebrand Warhammer?
Matt: Yeah, you pull it out, take it, swing it around, dust it off a bit.
Travis: Can I get it to light?
Matt: Bursts into flames, and for a second that warmth near your face is like an old friend coming to roost for a bit.
Travis: Can you hear me? (laughter)
Matt: (fire sounds)
Travis: The silent type. I like it. (laughter)
Matt: All right. You guys all have your evening's rest. Though it is an early evening, you manage to comfortably, after a number of harrowing experiences, recoup, recover, wake up to a grand chickenful breakfast.
Marisha: Yeah. (laughter)
Sam: Chicken and eggs, everyone!
Laura: Yay!
Ashley: Chicken and waffles, perhaps?
Sam: Nope, just eggs.
Ashley: Oh, just eggs, okay.
Sam: What's a waffle?
Ashley: I don't know, it's like a mishmash of dough, the side--
Sam: Sounds great.
Taliesin: Can I spend my tinkering check building a waffle iron? I'm just kidding. I'm kind of kidding. I'm going to put that aside for later.
Matt: Okay. Okay.
Marisha: (laughs) I'm going to put that aside.
Sam: I spent some of the morning just with a little piece of parchment paper and a pen, just writing out something.
Matt: Okay. All right. You guys finish your rest, the servants are eager to send you on your way, should you require anything else. Otherwise, you guys continue your journey?
Taliesin: Let's head towards the town.
Sam: We walk, is that what we do?
Taliesin: We walk.
Sam: What is this walking thing? It's terrible.
Taliesin: It's also very inconspicuous. I know you're not a fan of inconspicuous, but there's nothing you want to be conspicu-ed by, here.
Marisha: I mean, I could mist, I could Wind Walk us. Do we want to Wind Walk it?
Sam: I mean, will that burn something?
Marisha: My 6th-level spell.
Sam: Let's just walk, then.
Matt: All right. You guys walking north?
Laura: I float on my broom.
Matt: Okay. Who's leading?
Laura: And keep an eye out in front for any sort of problems.
Liam: Have fun, doofus!
Laura: Shh! Yes, I'm leading.
Travis: This is a lot to leave off, that's a lot.
Matt: Well, you know. (laughter)
Travis: To not have. That's a big fucking difference.
Laura: Would you have kept it if you had known all those other things? Or would you have wanted to use more of it?
Travis: You don't know.
Matt: This is, by the way, the benefits of Identify spells and things like that.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Travis: Oh, well, if only I'd used my Identify spell.
Matt: But going forward, if you have something you don't know about, you can always go to people with those abilities and be like, could you see what the fuck this does?
Laura: Do any of our people have Identify?
Marisha: Negative. It's like a wizard thing.
Travis: I didn't even know people could do that.
Matt: Allura or Gilmore could probably do that for you.
Laura: Don't act like you know for sure. (laughter)
Liam: I know about Gilmore.
Ashley: Such a twinsies.
Matt: Aw, so good. All right, so. You guys start heading northward, you're leading then, Vex? Make a survival check. Technically in the forest, since you're moving through.
Liam: Yeah!
Laura: 26.
Matt: Not a problem. Utilizing the backtracking of the path you guys took through anyway, is there anything you want to do while you're in the forest? Pushing through? Okay. So you keep moving north--
Laura: Oh! Did you want to look for that lake, or are you good, Grog?
Travis: Oh, right, remember there was a lake when we were looking for the heart of a nymph?
Laura: Doesn't it lead into the Fey world? The plane?
Travis: Yeah, there's a portal there, right? And isn't one of the vestiges in the Fey?
Laura: In the Fey world?
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Do we want to do that first, or do we want to deal with--
Laura: We should probably, but I do want to come back here.
Taliesin: Oh yes, of course, it'll be right, next thing we do.
Travis: Yeah, only if it's close, otherwise I'm good to go back to Westruun. Only if the lake was close, I don't know where it is.
Liam: Are you in a hurry to talk to Dad?
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: We don't have to stop there, that's fine.
Liam: Maybe later.
Marisha: I mean, do you need to talk to Dad?
Liam: No. We do not need to talk to Dad.
Laura: Let's go to Westruun!
Taliesin: Westruun it is!
Liam: Sore spot.
Matt: Continuing pushing forward, I'd like you all to make a stealth check. (something clatters offscreen)
Laura: Oh, shit. (laughter)
Sam: Someone just failed it. Pike!
Matt: With disadvantage, Pike.
Ashley: Disadvantage? Okay.
Travis: I'm still there, right? No, we took a long rest!
Matt: Yeah, you're fine, you're no longer exhausted.
Travis: 28.
Ashley: Can I put on my Boots of Levitation?
Sam: Too late.
Liam: Too late.
Matt: Too late.
Ashley: I rolled a six.
Travis: Yeah, she's back!
Ashley: Pike is back! What would it be without some clanging?
Matt: So as you guys are making your way across the path, keeping as quiet as you can, Pike, you're starting to fall behind a little bit, and in trying to catch up, you get a run on before you start to hear this (hiss) out of the side of the forest, and you see a deep blue scaled-looking lizard entity. You see in the distance a basilisk that's coming over the ridge.
Marisha: Oh, again.
Taliesin: I wouldn't have let her get that far back, I would've been hanging back there too.
Matt: Okay, then you're hanging with her and you see this as well, what are you guys doing? It's about, it's about 30, 40 feet off.
Taliesin: How big is it?
Marisha: Should we run?
Matt: It's the same size as the other ones, they're about five and a half, six feet from nose to back end.
Travis: Let's run. I pick up Pike, I put her on my shoulder, and we run.
Matt: Okay. First off, Pike, I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: Aw, because you saw it.
Matt: You glanced over and saw it before you realized.
Ashley: I don't think I did, though. (laughter)
Ashley: Oh! I got 19.
Matt: 19, okay. Just the instinctual glance at it, you're like, oh crap, and you feel the impact of its gaze. However, you're a fairly hardy gnome and you resist the creeping stone-based enchantment. As you begin to run forward, Percy pushes behind you as Grog rushes forward, both of you guys recognizing that sound and averting your gaze, pick up Pike and you all begin charging forward. As you do, you can hear the hiss behind you gathered by a second one. (hissing) And the sounds of many feet charging through the snow quickly. I would like you guys all to go ahead and, we'll say for the sake of this, just roll dexterity checks. Or no, athletics. This would be your run speed on this one, sorry.
Laura: What if I'm on the broom, though?
Matt: If you're on the broom, you don't have to worry about it, you're not exerting energy to maintain a pace. Athletics.
Travis: 24.
Ashley: 19.
Liam: 30.
Marisha: Ten.
Taliesin: Ten.
Sam: 11.
Matt: Okay. You guys all manage to maintain a fairly decent pace; these creatures are fairly quick and as they begin to catch up, you begin to use your guidance as a person who knows the forest fairly well to begin ducking in and out of areas, using snowbanks at your disposal. At one point, Grog, you see a partially broken old dying tree that you just go ahead and grab and throw behind you. Make a strength check?
Travis: 21.
Matt: 21. With one hand you grab it and, boom, the actual trunk, old and long-rotted, snaps and falls behind you with a large impact. You believe from the sound of it, it at least hit or halted one of them for a short time, it's just a (snarl) sound. And as you guys continue pushing forward towards the northern side of this forest, the sound of the hissing begins to slowly subside as you dodge back and forth, zigzagging across this pathway. Eventually you guys, over about an additional hour and a half of pushing forward, you hear, and have not heard any following hissing sound for a while, and eventually see before you the outside of the Frostweald Forest finally approaching. With that, you guys push through the last elements of this frozen forest, back into the fields heading northward towards Westruun proper. With that, we're going to take a quick break. (cheering)
Matt: So yeah, we're going to go ahead and take a little trip here to the restroom, we'll see you guys here in a few minutes to continue the next length of this journey.
Travis: We get to play that shit again, right?
Liam: Why did it get so scary? [break]
Matt: And welcome back, everybody. So. Returning from-- Stop dying. Returning from that harrowing endeavor, you continue your trek northward toward Westruun. It is a few days' travel to make your way, a little over two days, I think, from where the Frostweald is, you can stop and pass by the camp at the lake if you wish to, or continue pressing forward, it's up to you.
Marisha: Well, we should probably stop by and tell them that their problem has been handled.
Taliesin: We could stop by later and tell them that both their problems have been handled.
Marisha: Why can't we stop by now? They're right here, we might as well pop in. We'll forget if we don't do it now. I know us. It'll be three months before we come back, and then we'll be like, by the way--
Laura: No, we're coming back soon because we're going into the Feywild.
Taliesin: Well, they know their problem's been handled because we sent all their people back to them.
Marisha: Let's just talk to them real fast. Okay. We pop in, we're like, hey.
Laura: I think Keyleth wants a reward.
Matt: You guys stop by the Foramere Basin, where you originally saw the encampment of some of the survivors of the Westruun incursion by the Chroma Conclave. As you approach, some of the guards immediately come up, crossbows up, when they notice who it was before previously, they lower their weapons and one of the guards comes forward, approaches you, saying, "Good to see that you've returned. We've managed to also acquire our recently captured individuals, most at least have come back safely, it's appreciated. If you wish to talk to Cornelius, well, he should be up and about. I'll take you." Leads you guys into the camp. As you find your way in, folks around you tend to stop again and watch you quietly as you pass, a few with smiles, and you see a few people wave and say, thank you. And you do see a couple of individuals that you did help escape from the orc encampment, they themselves are still on the mend, a lot of them were fairly brutalized when they were there, but the same child that you found in the tent just runs up and gives a big ol' hug to Vex and holds you for a second, then lets go and runs back off to her mother. You're led back to the tent where Cornelius originally met with you guys, but Cornelius is outside of the tent right now, just in the process of cutting firewood that's going to be used for the firepits later on.
Laura: Where'd he find the wood? I thought there were no trees around.
Matt: You imagine that they don't go to other nearby wooded areas and cut them down?
Travis: Yeah, poke the DM. (glass shatters offscreen)
Liam: Oh dear.
Matt: And that's what happens. (laughter)
Matt: You think that was an accident.
Taliesin: When you're in 50 episodes, this is the first one.
Marisha: This is the first one. It's like that scene in the second Matrix.
Matt: Let's not remember the second Matrix. Cornelius is there. What little bit of timber they've managed to scavenge or find from local wooded areas, Cornelius sits there, wipes his brow, his sleeves rolled up. "Oh. Hold on just a second." He puts his axe down and walks over, wipes his hands. "Well, you're true to your word. And for that I'm real appreciative. You did us a real favor and brought back some good people alive and intact."
Sam: Did your brother make it back safely?
Matt: "Cyrus did and I certainly had a very stern talking-to to that boy. But I--"
Sam: Don't go too hard on him, he was being held up by a rope and tortured by a bunch of monsters.
Laura: Pretty traumatizing, I would assume.
Matt: (laughs) "That would be him, wouldn't it? Well, nevertheless, I appreciate it. Looks like through some talks we might be able to bring most of us into Kymal for the time being. It's the town to the west of here. It's small, it's cramped, but we figure at least that's better than being out here in the open. And we have numbers there, so we'll be a little more protected."
Taliesin: Well, that's where we'll send word if anything happens in Westruun.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Heading to Westruun yourself, now?"
Marisha: It's next on the list.
Laura: If all goes well, you may be able-- no, I don't know.
Taliesin: Let's not make promises.
Laura: Dragons.
Marisha: Dragons.
Laura: It may be a while, but we're trying.
Matt: "Well, I wish you all the best of luck. Yeah. Figure if anyone could do it, it'd probably be you folk. Well. I look forward to hearing from your victorious recovery of our homestead, and I'll get the first round when we come back to our town."
Marisha: Farewell, Cornelius.
Matt: "Stay safe." He turns around and grabs his axe again and starts chopping through the wood once more.
Laura: Was there anything else you wanted to do, Keyleth?
Marisha: No, I'm good.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Do we need to check in with Drez? No, we know what he wants.
Liam: Fuck Drez.
Marisha: That guy's a weasel.
Sam: We have his Hunk of Quall.
Marisha: That was a gift, I'm pretty sure. It's a loaner, it's on loan for the foreseeable future until we save the world.
Ashley: Mr. Vina. Mr. Drez Vina.
Matt: Drez Vina, who is the assistant to Master Quall. Who is the one that originally hired you. And by the fact that he called a debt on the initial enchanted ruby that you used on your first endeavor, yeah, you get the feeling that whatever this object is that he gave you, it's probably on loan.
Ashley: (coughs)
Travis: Pike! Are you all right?
Sam: Heal her!
Matt: So you guys continue forward into Westruun?
Sam: To Westruun. And what is our mission?
Laura: Okay, what are we, what's our plan here, Grog?
Travis: What time is it?
Matt: You guys have traveled for one day, you've gone into the evening, you can take a rest here or, you know, rest within your mansion on the outskirts of this encampment before it roots up and starts heading back to Kymal relatively soon. You guys then, the next morning, can continue your trek northward, and you can probably get to Westruun by the end of day, if you travel quickly and consistently.
Laura: What do you think, Grog, what do you want to do? Walk right into town?
Travis: No. No. I like what Percy said, I think there's worth in being clever.
Taliesin: I would agree.
Travis: I would actually like to maybe run some ideas by you. We don't walk into town, but we have the town walk out to us.
Sam: How do we do that?
Taliesin: Oh, there's many ways we could do that.
Travis: Well, look, so there are people in there that are innocents, right, we told the farmer we'd get his people back and I really want to see if Wilhand's all right. So listen. How do you feel about sending someone in that would draw out their worst?
Taliesin: I think we could draw out their worst very easily. Hmm. How committed are your people to trial by combat?
Travis: Oh, it's about all we do.
Taliesin: What can you imagine would be the most exciting show they could possibly hope for?
Laura: A rematch, I would think.
Travis: Well, it wasn't really an official fight, it was more of like a one-sided ass-whooping.
Laura: But they think you're dead.
Travis: Yeah. We're going to get to that later. I was thinking maybe we could set a fire and send someone running in and say there's a roving band of orcs that are challenging the goliaths, and then when they come out and leave we can move into the town and get all the innocents out. And then if we want, we could set a trap, or an ambush, or we could play some mind games, but I want to try and get the town clear first.
Sam: You know, your people might not be the brightest, but they're not going to send everybody out to meet these orcs.
Travis: No no no no. Just a few.
Marisha: And probably not Kevdak.
Travis: Well, look, if it's not Kevdak, we get a practice round on those that do come out.
Marisha: Well, here's my question  there's got to be hundreds of people still left in Westruun. It could take hours to evacuate a city of that size.
Travis: Well, so you know how last time when we went over there and Horace was just outside the city walls? I'm pretty sure if we wait for a bit, somebody will come out, we take him, we mess him up real good, maybe take his tongue out, chop off his arms, and then send him back in.
Taliesin: Some of that is...
Travis: I mean, I'm open to augmenting that plan a little bit.
Sam: I could make you look like an orc or something.
Travis: No, like I said before, if I go in there--
Sam: No no no, just to rough up the guy that we send back in to tell them about the orcs.
Travis: I'll hold him while somebody else can rough him up, but--
Taliesin: How smart are your people?
Travis: Well, pretty smart, they're all like me.
Laura: As smart as you?
Travis: Yeah, scholars the lot.
Marisha: Grog. If someone kills Kevdak, say hypothetically you, who takes control of the Herd after that?
Travis: Well, my math is a little shoddy, but I think that would be me.
Marisha: Well then, why do we need to evacuate the city if you could theoretically have control over it?
Liam: If we could figure out where Kevdak is and drop in on that point.
Laura: Well, he's in the mayor's--
Liam: Yeah. And handle Kevdak before the rest of the city can descend upon us. It's a gamble, but so is everything we do.
Laura: Yeah, but if the city, if the rest of them don't see him defeating Kevdak, then it's worthless. They need to watch it happen.
Liam: Well, how honorable are your people, if you fell Kevdak or whatever the fuck his name is, will the rest stand down?
Travis: Maybe, but-- (sighs) So, here it is. My whole life has been wanting to punish or get back at Kevdak. I don't want to do it cheaply, I don't want to do it quickly. I want to do it with my own hands. Now, I'll do it with my family, do it with my buddy Pike, but I want it done right.
Taliesin: I've got a thought. It's dangerous, but I have a thought. You literally walk, march right to the city gates and demand a challenge.
Marisha: I have a feeling you're going to be the most attractive bait that we can think of.
Taliesin: If we put you right in front there, perhaps we let Pike stay with you, I doubt there's any of them who will not want to watch that. And while they're watching, the rest of us do our best to get everybody as safe as possible.
Laura: But what's to keep Grog safe in the meantime?
Taliesin: They won't want to sully that fight, no one will want to sully that fight.
Travis: No, I can guarantee you, no one will interfere.
Taliesin: And if things get bad--
Marisha: We'll be nearby.
Taliesin: We'll pull him out.
Travis: I like that.
Laura: I don't want to abandon Grog to a fight with Kevdak while we're freeing villagers. No offense to them. I want to have Grog's back.
Liam: I agree with that.
Marisha: I think we won't need to worry about freeing the villagers if we can defeat Kevdak.
Laura: What if we stay hidden?
Travis: Oh, wait a minute. Right, so they think I'm dead.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Maybe I let them think I conquered death.
Laura: Which you kind of did, Grog.
Travis: Maybe we let them think that I'm not the same Grog I was before. Maybe we let them think I've gained abilities.
Marisha: I'm pretty sure all those things are actually true.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, but I mean like--
Sam: Yeah, yeah, make a show of it a bit.
Travis: Yeah. But they don't have to see where those abilities come from.
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: All they've got to see is me. There are roofs, right, I mean it's like two- and three-story buildings all in that city.
Ashley: It just makes me so nervous.
Laura: So wait, we stay hidden and you call lightning.
Travis: Yeah. You guys get all up on the roofs while I'm making a scene in the middle and we pull off the greatest stage show there's ever been.
Sam: I love a good stage show.
Ashley: This is not a bad idea.
Marisha: We can make you look as cool as you want. That's undeniable.
Travis: If I do a pelvic thrust, will you do your--
Sam: I will grant you cock lightning.
Travis: Holy shit. "I will grant you cock lightning."
Liam: Weirdest production of Grease ever.
Taliesin: How many objects are you attuned to right now?
Travis: Three.
Sam: If he could unattune to one, we can put him in the Hat of Disguise.
Travis: I don't want it.
Taliesin: What do you have right now?
Travis: I have the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength.
Taliesin: That's good.
Travis: I have the flaming--
Laura: Warhammer?
Travis: Yup.
Taliesin: That's good.
Travis: And the belt. What's the other? Oh, and my--
Laura: You gained the ability to grow a beard in the afterlife. It's pretty major.
Matt: Well, you have three of those, so you have to get rid of the necklace.
Travis: Actually, the flaming warhammer's not attuned.
Matt: Oh, that's right. That's true, no, you're good.
Taliesin: What does the amulet do?
Travis: It gives me plus two to my AC.
Marisha: Pretty nice.
Taliesin: That's pretty nice.
Sam: And so the object of this would be to stall, to enthrall, to captivate them as long as you can, keep talking to them, not engage in fights for as long as possible while we--
Travis: Get in place. I mean, I could try and do it while you're getting the hostages out, or we could just take down the snake's head.
Taliesin: We need his Knuckles.
Laura: Kill Kevdak.
Sam: Yeah, but is Kevdak going to engage in a fight with a magical Grog? That's not a fair fight, is it?
Laura: It's a pride issue.
Ashley: I think he will.
Travis: I do know how to get his pride in check.
Laura: Grog, would you engage in a fight with a magical being who wronged you, if you thought you were better than him?
Travis: Why, who said something?
Sam: And when they discover, and they surely will, that you are not magical and that your friends are aiding you, will that bring you great shame?
Travis: No. No, I made a choice. This is my family. My old family left me to die.
Marisha: Plus, I mean, it's like wearing really cool robes. Right, Scanlan? You know, there's nothing wrong with wanting to look cool.
Sam: I don't know about wanting to look cool, it just comes naturally.
Ashley: Let's make sure that it doesn't happen, that they won't know.
Laura: Nice beret there, Scanlan.
Taliesin: This is going to end with a fight between the two of you, there's no denying that.
Liam: Anyway, Kevdak's using a gift of the gods.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: That's right! He's full of shit.
Ashley: These are very scary people, you guys. They left him in a very horrible state and I would not like to see that again.
Marisha: But that was years ago!
Taliesin: We defeated the people who left me in a horrible state, I think we will have no problem defeating the people who left him.
Liam: We have a gift of the gods and soon we will have many more.
Sam: So you do intend to engage in a fight. Because otherwise I would say, I can go in, just sort of looking like you, and draw their attention.
Taliesin: And then what?
Sam: And then bamf outta there.
Taliesin: But then what?
Sam: Or run away and draw them with me.
Taliesin: How does that save the city?
Sam: It gets them to follow me.
Travis: Yeah, I mean, and either way, I like that because either way, if only the pawns of the group follow him out? That's fewer goliaths we have to worry about. Best-case scenario, Kevdak, Zanror, and the best of the baddies chase him out, we can get the hostages out, and then set the trap for when they come back.
Taliesin: It's not just the hostages, though, it's a city under siege. I just don't think it's feasible to empty it.
Marisha: Right, but you have to remember it's-- right, yes, pretty much. What you said. It's a city under siege, under siege, it's meta under siege, under siege from the goliaths and then again from the dragons.
Taliesin: They're in a place, though, where if we can get rid of the goliaths, at least they could function with the dragons.
Laura: And if we remove all of the villagers, it'll definitely gain the attention of the dragons.
Marisha: That's true.
Travis: Will it? I thought they only fly over every few days.
Marisha: They have wyverns who have been running patrol.
Travis: Not over Westruun.
Taliesin: Not over Westruun.
Marisha: But we haven't been hanging out over Westruun.
Travis: If there are no wyverns, are you open to the idea of gerbil-ball Scanlan doing a thing?
Marisha: No, not at all. But that's actually not a bad idea. We're still outside the camp, right? How about this: why don't we hike to the outskirts of Westruun, camp out the rest of the evening, keep an eye out, and just scout for a little bit?
Travis: Yeah, and if we get close, hopefully we can ask somebody that's nice if they've seen any dragons and how long it's been since.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Well, we probably want to set up shop for a while and wait for the dragons to come and leave and then strike, so that we've got some time.
Taliesin: Very clever.
Travis: That's brilliant.
Liam: We use fake shithead Grog. Sorry. Fake shitheadier Grog to create a scene and run off and draw away some of the goliaths, probably not Kevdak, and then you go in for the main event with a thinned-out Herd.
Travis: Yep. I like it.
Marisha: I can be on the roofs nearby along with Vex and Percy doing range.
Laura: What if we do the same thing that those orcs did? When you go in and cause a distraction and lead them out, we spend the few days that we're waiting for the dragons to build a massive trench, you can use Move Earth, and lead them all out over something and drop a Herd of goliaths.
Marisha: And I can do the Hallucinatory Terrain thing again. It has been a while.
Laura: Drop them into a trench, they're stuck in there while he fights Kevdak.
Marisha: And I do love using that spell.
Travis: I'm game.
Ashley: I like this idea.
Sam: It still doesn't solve one question.
Travis: What's that?
Sam: I love you, but can you beat Kevdak without magic and friends?
Travis: I mean, look, we're going to find out one way or the other. I don't know. But look.
Laura: Can we aid you?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: This isn't like the Crucible.
Travis: No, look, he's wearing weapons given by a god. I don't care if it's a totally fair fight, I just don't want to dispatch him cheaply.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: We can do this. We've got lightning.
Liam: That's very intelligent of you, Grog.
Sam: That means good.
Laura: Smart.
Travis: Oh. Thank you.
Taliesin: Let's rest up and wait for the dragons.
Marisha: All right, so we're going to hike to the outskirts of Westruun.
Matt: Okay. You guys, during this journey, find your way northward. Are you skirting around the west side like you did when you first arrived?
Laura: Sure?
Matt: All right.
Laura: We're keeping a good distance, as we get closer, so it lasts, I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Travis: We have that really nice high grass, right?
Matt: It was like waist-high or so.
Travis: Not like cornstalk high.
Matt: There were areas where there was, like during the thick farmland, there are areas where they have high-stalk.
Travis: I'd like to stay there, I'd like to stay in those areas.
Matt: Okay, so you'll be pretty much dodging from farmland to farmland, on the outside. I need you all to roll stealth checks, if you could?
Laura: Add ten because I cast Pass Without a Trace.
Ashley: I'm going to use, oh no. Because that won't be enough time.
Sam: Come on, Pikey.
Travis: That's good.
Laura: That's really good. Plus ten.
Ashley: Plus ten?
Laura: Yeah, because I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Travis: 19. Oh. 29.
Ashley: 24.
Laura: 33.
Liam: 30.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 23.
Sam: 20.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: We're quiet.
Travis: He rolled anyway.
Matt: All right, as you guys leap into the high grass, moving around the outside of Westruun, eyes peeled, as the sun sets and the night kicks in, you try your best to watch for any patrols that are keeping an eye. Make a perception check.
Travis: 13.
Sam: 16.
Marisha: 19.
Taliesin: 20.
Liam: 22.
Laura: 32.
Ashley: 23.
Matt: All right. The three of you guys glance over and you do see there is a patrol of three individuals, one of which appears to be goliath in nature, the other two humanoid of some degree. In the distance, it's hard to see this far away. And they're patrolling the same area where you guys came through before. It appears like the patrol has increased, like there's a mildly heightened state of awareness that something bad went down recently. However, you stay far enough away and out of sight, they do not catch visual on you and eventually you get enough distance northward where you feel like they haven't really noticed.
Travis: Did we pass the area that we were at before, where the farmer, Frederick?
Matt: Yeah, you passed that area, yeah.
Travis: Did we see him?
Matt: You did not see him, no.
Laura: Was his name Frederick? No, it was with an 'r'.
Sam: Can we go to that place?
Travis: Reggie. Reginald, sorry.
Sam: Can we sneak there, can Vax sneak there? What was the man's name who we killed?
Laura: Oh, that you killed?
Travis: Horace.
Sam: No no no, the goliath.
Travis: Horace.
Sam: Vax, can you go get Horace's head?
Taliesin: Okay, that's a good idea.
Liam: Yeah, I can get that.
Taliesin: I take that back, that's a great idea.
Liam: I don't know why, but I can get that.
Matt: So you're heading forward to do that?
Laura: I rolled a better stealth than him, though.
Matt: Make a new stealth check. As you guys hold back and you--
Laura: Oh, that's so much better! No, it's good.
Liam: 39.
Matt: 39, okay. So as you guys wait in the back, staying low to the grass, you watch as Vax dives into the field and vanishes. You, darting in a forward way, find your way to the outside of the initial crop-grid. There does not appear to be any guards that are watching this property. You recall the various avenues you guys utilized in systematically making your way from path to path. It takes you a few minutes, but you manage to find an area that looks familiar enough where you find your way into the center of one of the crop lanes where the corpse of Horace recently was. Roll a perception check.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27. You get there and you glance about. But the body's gone.
Liam: Fuck.
Matt: Body's not there, it's taken. You start following the trail, you see where maybe it was dragged off. Make a survival roll.
Liam: Survival roll? Well, I'm going to use Luck, because I slept. Yeah. 18.
Matt: 18, okay, so you find signs of his body being dragged and you start trying to find the direction it was taken. You dart along, once again keeping within the crops as best you can to stay out of sight. You make your way out of the northern side of it before the trail disappears. You do not know where the body was taken, other than north and outward. You glance over and all you see is the original farmhouse where Reginald was living, there's the crops out there, there's the big scarecrow that was in the center. There wasn't a scarecrow before. You look over real close and you see, strung up across a haphazard wooden spike, arms out, is the currently being pecked apart body of Reginald, who apparently suffered the brunt of the discovery of Horace's corpse in the time that has transpired since you last left Westruun.
Liam: Do I sense anything around?
Matt: At the moment? No. The patrol's probably a good ten minutes before it's seeming, because it's headed in the direction where you are but you don't know, probably take ten or 15 minutes before they reach where you are.
Liam: I'm going to stealth up to the body. Cut him down.
Matt: Okay. Cut the ropes off, he slumps down.
Liam: I shoulder him back to the group.
Matt: Okay. Make a stealth check with disadvantage.
Liam: 20.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 25. 35.
Matt: Okay. Though he wasn't a very heavy individual, and especially now that he's been out to dry for at least a couple days, most of the bloat has worn off and the-- not going into graphic detail, elements of the corpse have been left behind. You bring most of him with you through the grass over to the rest of the group. You guys watch as Vax pulls his way up out of the grass, carrying over his shoulder the lifeless body of Reginald.
Liam: Let's all talk about repercussions. And I lay him out.
Taliesin: Well, they know we're here now.
Travis: Do they?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: I think they thought it was him.
Liam: They did not think the farmer killed Horace.
Travis: We should've sent him off to the camp.
Taliesin: They know we're here now because now his body's missing.
Sam: Also, I assume they tortured him before they killed him.
Taliesin: I don't know if they're that clever.
Sam: Can you talk to the dead?
Liam: These people were in a shit situation, while I don't blame us entirely for this because of where they live now, we must not do anything we're doing lightly. There are many lives at stake, not just Reginald's. Let's just not flit about, here, let's take this seriously, please.
Taliesin: Should've left him up there.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: Should've cut him down tomorrow. One more day up there would have made no difference to him, and it's going to make a difference to us because we have to move tonight now.
Marisha: Maybe it's a matter of respect, Percy.
Taliesin: Respect him by freeing his daughter.
Travis: I agree.
Laura: They know we're here.
Taliesin: They know we're here.
Laura: They're going to see he's missing.
Marisha: I think they already knew we were here.
Taliesin: I don't think they did.
Travis: I don't think they did either.
Liam: Scanlan, can you make a fake stupid body, can you make a scarecrow?
Sam: Not really. Not really.
Liam: Can any of us?
Laura: I can fashion something.
Taliesin: No, tonight's fine. There's nothing wrong with tonight. I just figure, if we do it, and we should do it, and obviously this is nothing if not a sign that we should've done it sooner.
Sam: Why don't we just burn the whole field? They won't know if there's a body in there or not.
Taliesin: That was our reasoning last time, no, we do this, I think we do this tonight.
Marisha: We do this tonight?
Ashley: I could cast Speak with Dead and we could ask him some questions.
Sam: We could.
Ashley: We could ask him up to five questions.
Sam: Let's do it.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: So you guys quietly press down in a small area of grass to give you enough of a space for you to go ahead and perform this ritual. As you lay the body down, you look up to the sky and where some of the cloud cover that is slowly drawing over the area, there's a little gap in the clouds, and as you look up to the now-visible stars, you whisper Sarenrae's name, look down at the body, touch it with your hand, and the still corpse, the chest begins to rise and fall with an unnatural breath for the time being. The eyes begin to twitch and move around. No physical movement beyond that, but the mouth slowly draws open and you hear, while the lips do not move, you hear a voice emanate through like an exhale. "You returned."
Laura: Reginald. We're so sorry.
Matt: "I knew what I was getting into. Do not fret or blame."
Laura: We will rescue your daughter.
Travis: Five questions. Vax. Make it count.
Taliesin: Do they know we're coming?
Liam: Me?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I think we can all ask.
Liam: Reginald, how much do your murderers know? About us?
Matt: "I told them it was me. They should not and could not know your intent to return."
Sam: Can he describe the one who did it?
Liam: Go ahead, Scanlan.
Sam: Hi. Sorry. The ones who did you in. Other than large and pale, were there any distinguishing marks or names thrown about?
Matt: "They brought me to one of their leaders. Half-tattooed face and brow and rags. His jaw, once broken, pushes to one side. I know not the name."
Travis: Do I understand that description?
Matt: You recall the tattoo, and you recall the moment the jaw was broken.
Travis: I was wondering.
Matt: This was Zanror.
Sam: This was who?
Travis: Kevdak's son.
Liam: He broke it. Grog broke it.
Laura: Oh shit.
Taliesin: What are the things that we face inside the city? What should we fear inside the city?
Matt: "Fear those that are fueled by rage, skilled with weapons, and those that call the elements their own. And the dragon does come."
Travis: Does come. One more question, can we ask if he's seen the dragon or how long it's been?
Sam: Go ahead.
Travis: We thank you for your time. If we may, how long has it been since the dragon was last here?
Matt: "Two days."
Laura: It's coming tomorrow.
Travis: Two days, it's coming back. Okay.
Laura: That means tomorrow it's coming back.
Sam: We can wait another day. How many more questions?
Laura: Is that it, or one more?
Sam: No, we get five.
Taliesin: We have one more if we want it.
Sam: What would you like us to tell your daughter?
Matt: "Tell her that my life was given so she could live hers. And my memory lives in her eyes." And with that, the head just lolls back a little bit, the jaw hangs open, the last of the breath in the chest (exhales) and the magic fades.
Taliesin: Vax. We have to put it back.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: They don't know we're here. It could be anyone who could've cut him down. Why would they suspect us? I would suspect the village people first.
Travis: I would too, and I'm the smartest of them all.
Laura: Which is actually worse. We need to put something back up. I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
Taliesin: He's going to save his daughter one last time, we're going to put him back up for one day. We're going to wait for the dragon to pass, and then he will be buried on his land properly with stone and dirt.
Liam: Yes. I'll take him. Yes.
Taliesin: Thank you. And thank you for bringing him. This was helpful.
Ashley: Can we give him a proper burial?
Travis: No, we're going to put him back up.
Ashley: We're going to put him back up, that's what you. Sorry.
Matt: Vax, are you taking the corpse back? Stealth check with disadvantage.
Liam: Disadvantage.
Matt: Yeah, carrying him along, man.
Liam: Oh, it's all right, though, 35.
Taliesin: Jesus Christ.
Matt: Rogues. Coming back, as you approach the outside you can see now the patrol has skirted by and you have to wait patiently, but not wait too long because you know you have about a 30-second window before they will come into sight of this farmstead. Using that, you dart forward, take the body, thrust it up, trying to catch-- I want you to go ahead and make a dexterity check to see how fast you can utilize what rope is at your disposal.
Liam: Just straight dexterity? 17.
Matt: 17. With that, you throw the body up, look over your shoulder, grab out, pull out bits of twine you have, a piece of rope or a piece of your shirt that you (tearing noise) tear off to the side, and fashion a quick knot over one arm and the other, you look over your shoulder again, you can see the shadow of them beginning to just turn around the side, you get the other arm up, just manage to slump it over the wood. You know there isn't any more time, and with that you duck back underneath the grass and vanish. He's haphazardly up and one arm is not actually tied, it's just kind of laid over it, but he's currently back on the wooden stake, across.
Liam: Better than what it was.
Matt: As you dart back and slowly return to your group, glancing over in that direction, the patrol doesn't seem to take notice and continues walking past.
Travis: So am I the only one that, while we wait, is itching for a fight?
Laura: Grog.
Travis: I'm sorry, look, it's just who I am.
Sam: Well listen, if you want a fight, we could still use one of their heads. We could find one of those patrolmen walking around, grab him, take his head.
Taliesin: Too soon.
Travis: Too soon.
Marisha: Did we not just learn anything?
Liam: We're going to be fighting soon enough. I think everyone should hide inside your love shack and my sister and I should wait here in the grass and watch and wait. And when the dragon comes, we alert you all.
Taliesin: We wait for a dragon pass. The day after the dragon passes, we strike.
Laura: I agree.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: Let's go.
Matt: You guys, most of you, other than the twins, head into the magnificent mansion. An evening that is restful by definition but still wracked with tension and anxiety. You guys watch throughout the night, relatively uneventful, though a cool evening. Without building a fire, you both do have to keep bundled up against the elements. It's not cold enough to the point where it's going to be impactful, but it is chilly.
Liam: I fart a lot.
Matt: The farting does keep you warm, Vax.
Taliesin: I want to tinker for the evening as well.
Matt: Make another tinker check.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: 21. Okay. You made headway. You've constructed a portion of the seat and the apparatus that connects it to the broom without interfering with the enchantment. Right now it's testing that and then getting the stirrups and making sure that it's functional and not going to get her killed.
Taliesin: Whatever night we have time, I want to keep poking at that.
Marisha: Can I also spend some time practicing a Protection from Energy potion?
Matt: Want to go ahead and utilize the delightfully presented brewing vicinity in the--
Marisha: I do.
Matt: All right, sure.
Marisha: Not enough to where I can't, you know, sleep, but just, you know.
Taliesin: I'm going to lend her my resist lightning ring so that she can study it and hopefully come up with a resist energy potion.
Matt: Okay. I'll say, what level is that?
Marisha: Protection from Energy is a 3rd-level spell. (musical tone)
Matt: I don't know what that was.
Taliesin: Matt Mercer, white courtesy phone. Matt Mercer, white courtesy phone.
Matt: Now reaching housewares, spell scrolls.
Liam: Kevdak, you are wanted at the front gates.
Matt: Third, that would be an uncommon spell scroll, that would put it, I'd say that'd put it about-- how many gold pieces? I'd say you begin the process of brewing one.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: It'll take you a little while to get that done.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: A few days, at the very least. All right, so.
Sam: Grog. Just before tomorrow and stuff, Kevdak.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: His son is--
Travis: Zanror.
Sam: Zanror.
Travis: It's spelled-- it's spelled like this. And then like it sounds.
Sam: Sure, sure. Standard spelling. What about anyone else I need to know about? Who you were familiar with or had a relationship with?
Travis: Nah. Not any longer.
Sam: All right, so, we're still resting, right?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: So I'm going to knock on Pike's door. (knocking sound)
Ashley: I don't answer. No, I'm just kidding.
Sam: (whispers) I can still get in.
Ashley: Hi, Scanlan.
Sam: Hello. Did you get your robe and everything and your slippers?
Ashley: Oh, yes, slippers and everything.
Sam: The monogram?
Ashley: Yes, it's great, thank you so much. P.T.
Sam: And the scented candles?
Ashley: Yes, it smells so good in here. Thank you.
Sam: Great, great. If you need anything, there's two bells next to your bed, there's one to call servants and there's one for me.
Ashley: Oh, thank you, Scanlan.
Sam: The purple one is mine.
Marisha: Percy and I strategize.
Taliesin: We're doing strategies.
Sam: Great. Listen, there's been a lot of death recently and, well, just, I might die and stuff so, ah. Just don't read this until I do.
Liam: Can I read it?
Laura: Don't!
Ashley: What is this?
Laura: Pass it over.
Liam: Do you want to go steady? If yes, check this box.
Ashley: "Do not open" and in parentheses "(until I'm dead)."
Sam: That's all.
Ashley: Well, hopefully I never have to open this.
Sam: I hope so, too. That's all. Have a good night.
Ashley: Bye, Scanlan.
Sam: Bye.
Liam: (whispers) Secrets.
Ashley: I close the door, I open it, and I read it. (cheering)
Taliesin: I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you!
Travis: Nobody look, nobody look. Don't you look! Don't you look. Don't you look.
Laura: She's full-on reading it!
Sam: You know what? I love her anyway. (laughter)
Ashley: This is a bit of tome, so I think I should wait to read this, but a part of me-- Oh.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You clever fucker. Good god.
Ashley: Oh, man. (gasps)
Laura: Oh, I want to know what it says so fucking bad!
Travis: We got to wait for her to finish, because the night is young.
Sam: It's all dick pics. (laughter)
Laura: The cube. Over and over and over again.
Matt: In the meantime, while you're reading that, you guys are doing what?
Taliesin: We were strategizing. We were just, we're figuring out some strategy for how to make this work.
Matt: Okay, fair enough.
Liam: Dick pics hand-drawn by quill.
Taliesin: By candlelight.
Matt: As the evening progresses, you guys rest, preparing yourselves for the next day. You guys--
Laura: We're still outside.
Matt: You guys are woken up right as the sun begins to rise by the distant sound of (roar, sweeping wings).
Travis: Oh, fuck.
Matt: You shake Vax awake and you guys look up from the grass and you can see, coming down from the very very top of Gatshadow, you see the wings unfurled and with each swoosh down, the gargantuan black dragon streaks down, dive bombs just past the Bramblewood, and scoots over the entire city of Westruun, making its presence known. As it just roars out (roar, sweeping wings), circling over the city twice, three times, as you see lights going on in the city. As it goes over three times, seemingly content that it's made its presence known and asserted its vocal dominance over the vicinity by instilling some early-morning fear in the denizens of this town, the dragon then lands a little bit northwest of the city itself. It's hard to make out exactly what's happening at this distance, but you see it, at its size, circle around an area, scrape into the dirt a bit, take a moment, makes a couple of grumbled (snarls). Takes one of its claws and scoops up a large cart that has apparently a few sacks inside of it. And its wings (sweeping wings). It begins taking up in the air again and you can see now there are three goliaths that are walking away from the point. As the dragon turns and scoops one up in its other claw. And the two others turn around and watch it as it takes off towards the top of the mountain, unable to do anything.
Laura: That's one less fuck we have to worry about.
Matt: Up onto Gatshadow.
Taliesin: So we're watching the other two head back towards the--
Matt: Nobody sees this except for the twins.
Travis: No windows? Okay.
Matt: No, you guys are in another plane. You look out the window and it's just like this purple expanse.
Liam: It seems like a slim thread of hope, but perhaps the underlings are not entirely satisfied with this arrangement? Just scooped one up.
Laura: It's possible. I have a feeling they're having a hard time finding any sort of hoard to offer after this many days.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Fuck.
Liam: It's a long shot, but you told me about those giants.
Laura: Yes?
Liam: When you were with Zahra, and they turned. We shouldn't rely on it.
Laura: It's possible. If Grog can take control of the Herd, they may be able to fight with us. But I wouldn't trust them.
Liam: No.
Laura: We need to tell the others.
Liam: Yep.
Matt: You guys find your way back to the door, entering the mansion. Servants have already, at the sound of you entering, begin to appear out of their spectral, ethereal states, bowing to you, offering to take your coat.
Liam: Chicken, please.
Matt: "Right away, sir." And they drift off to prepare your bountiful breakfast. Eventually you go ahead and begin to muster the rest of your party down towards the breakfast area, and the rest of you come to consciousness and find your way to where the food is being served and Vex and Vax both wait, rather stone-faced, and prepared to speak.
Laura: Well. Dragon came. Not happy. You'll be glad to know, however, that it took one of your Herd away with it.
Taliesin: I imagine the offering was a little light.
Laura: Yes, that's what I think as well.
Travis: From the three that were walking around?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: What did the other two do?
Laura: Not much. What are you going to do when a dragon comes and takes someone away? Stand there and watch, really.
Liam: Your buddy Horace made it sound like it was easy street, but I don't know if that's entirely accurate.
Travis: We can use that.
Laura: They may not be very happy with the dragon right now. They may not care at all.
Taliesin: They may not be very happy with leadership that leaves them in a place where they're being taken advantage of. That's very clever. Might be time to move on.
Sam: Move on? Move in?
Taliesin: For them to leave.
Sam: Oh, for them to move on.
Taliesin: This is not a good deal for them anymore.
Laura: So we start today, yes?
Taliesin: I think it starts today.
Marisha: I think it starts right now.
Sam: Want to go in?
Travis: Well, I haven't had my morning shit yet, but as soon as I do--
Laura: While Grog shits, I'm just going to take a little nap, while he's shitting, it takes a while usually, right?
Marisha: Sure, yeah, yeah.
Liam: Same, same.
Taliesin: He'll play Candy Crush.
Laura: Something to recover a little bit of time.
Sam: Want me to guard the door?
Travis: I don't think I need it this time. (laughter)
Laura: I'll be right back.
Travis: What, you really got to go?
Laura: Oh no. Blocked.
Sam: She's going to go take a shit.
Laura: Don't say that!
Liam: Laura doesn't shit!
Sam: No, she doesn't.
Travis: All right. Yeah, then we do it. And we do it the way we said. Right?
Sam: You want me to go in, draw out as many as I can, but wait, no, first we have to prepare a trap, don't we? Isn't there a trap to be prepared?
Marisha: Yes, I can dig a trench pretty quickly, honestly, if we want to go the trench route? Is that we were thinking?
Travis: Now here's the thing. Sorry.
Sam: You need to be inside the city gates as well.
Travis: Well, hold on, what were you going to say?
Ashley: No, I, go.
Travis: So if we try and build that trench outside, right, we risk being seen and then pop goes the weasel. If you go in--
Sam: While I'm in, you can build the trench.
Travis: Well, what, can you go in looking like me, or can you go in looking like me on fire?
Sam: Go in and what?
Travis: Can you conjure just me, or could you be me as a walking flame?
Sam: Hmm, that would be harder. Yeah, that would be harder to do, to pull off, you're big. You're pretty big.
Travis: Oh I know, this is like a one-time thing for me, so I figured I'd just do it rockstar. I just want to see what it looks like.
Sam: If someone else set me on literal fire, I could, but I wouldn't--
Travis: We'll stand down from that idea, it was just a thought, no problem.
Taliesin: There's no bad idea when we're workshopping.
Sam: Spitballing, spitballing.
Travis: If we want to do the trench, we have to wait for nightfall.
Sam: I was going to make myself look like you, but a dead version of you. A zombified Grog.
Travis: I'm all right with that. Can I hear your best undead Grog?
Sam: (Grog voice) Right. So. Right so I'm. Ugh, I'm so dead.
Liam: Maybe you don't say anything. (laughter)
Sam: No, no, I just have to warm up, ah, mimimimi, right, right, rrrr. Cor, all right then, I've been dead for about five, six years.
Travis: It's amazing, it's like a verbal mirror. So, if we do the trench, though, we have to-- Percy--
Marisha: I could theoretically dig the trench possibly without anybody noticing, like tunnel underground and just tunnel it out and maybe even, you know. Leave like a thin layer of dirt, possibly? I dunno. Maybe.
Liam: Like Dig Dug.
Marisha: Like Dig Dug. Exactly the same thing.
Sam: Wait, can't you just shape earth without affecting the surface of it, I mean, can't you just shape the underneath of it?
Marisha: That's what I'm saying.
Sam: No one will even see it being moved.
Marisha: And I could possibly maybe carve it thin enough to where when they run over it it'll collapse.
Travis: Percy, what was your idea?
Taliesin: And mix a little black powder into the dirt.
Marisha: Well, I was also hoping, oh, and explode it as they run by--
Taliesin: Hit it with lightning and it'll go up.
Marisha: Also, if we could maybe have something fancy at the bottom of it to, you know. Finish them off.
Taliesin: Do we have something fancy to put at the bottom?
Sam: We have a bear.
Travis: If we do the ditch for the people that're coming out of the city, we waste it if it's not Zanror and Kevdak. If we go in--
Laura: At least it gets them out of commission.
Marisha: Yeah, I thought the trench was to thin the herd.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Literally.
Laura: Good. I like it.
Sam: So, wait, is there a gate to the city?
Matt: There are multiple entrances to the city. The few that you've seen are guarded with outward-facing defensive spikes and pikes that are set up to prevent any sort of like cavalry entry or just as a warning.
Liam: I have a question.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: For Grog. (crash in the background)
Sam: (laughs) What the hell's going on there tonight?
Liam: We fought your father and he was dead. What's the last thing the Herd has heard of your father?
Travis: I don't know. Last thing I remember, I was looking up at my father. And the rest of my Herd. He made no move to save me.
Liam: Well. I don't know how he got there, but we saved you from your father and the dead guy deep underground, so they lost him at some point. What if instead of Grog, you appeared as Grog's dad?
Sam: I don't know what Grog's dad looks like.
Liam: Yes you do, you fought him. He was a rotting corpse in front of you trying to kill you.
Travis: Way back in the beginning.
Sam: Of course. How could I forget? (laughter)
Liam: Make yourself look like that, I'm not exactly sure what that would do.
Taliesin: It could be interesting.
Liam: It could be interesting.
Marisha: I mean, it could also further instill Grog being powerful and undead.
Taliesin: Yes, that's actually even better.
Laura: If he brought his father back to fight underneath him.
Marisha: With him, right, like he's a necromancer.
Liam: And Kevdak would think that Grog's father was serving him.
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: And he wouldn't feel pissy if he saw one Grog do a magic trick and then the other Grog sprang up and said, "Fight me instead." It would seem more real.
Sam: What was your dad's name?
Liam: Larry?
Taliesin: Curly.
Marisha: Moe.
Matt: Do you remember? It was Stonejaw. So Stonejaw Strongjaw. (laughter)
Liam: Wow.
Sam: That's a terrible name!
Taliesin: That's embarrassing.
Laura: Wow.
Liam: That's like George Foreman IV.
Laura: He had an intelligence of four.
Matt: I know, yeah.
Travis: It's a repressed memory, all right?
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: He comes up never.
Liam: This is George Foreman.
Liam: This is also George Foreman. These three guys are also George Foreman.
Marisha: This is also George Foreman. These three guys are also George Foreman.
Matt: Other brother Darryl.
Taliesin: All right. So I say you, your dad, and maybe Pike walk up to the front door and then we get ready to hit them with the doozy once things start.
Marisha: All right, give me a little bit of time to dig a ditch.
Taliesin: No Pike?
Travis: No. If I walk in, I want to walk in on my own.
Laura: So this is only your fake father walking up at this point.
Travis: As the distraction, right?
Laura: Yes.
Laura: Done.
Taliesin: You're going to lure them out and we're going to hit them when they come out.
Sam: Okay, but wait. I've got to bring them out of a specific gate where there's going to be a trap and if you go in and rescue any other civilians, you have to bring them out through a different gate that doesn't have a trap at it.
Marisha: We're not going to worry about that.
Taliesin: We're not going to evacuate several thousand people, it's just not going to happen.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: We're going to kill Kevdak. He's going to kill Kevdak.
Sam: All right. I'm ready to do this except for a few holes in our plan.
Travis: Yeah, go ahead.
Sam: I don't run very fast. (laughter)
Sam: Maybe if I Polymorph as a goliath, I would have their speed, right?
Ashley: What if you borrow my boots that levitate? Then you can--
Sam: I can't move myself, though, I couldn't just, I would be the Dread Pirate Roberts.
Matt: There will be no survivors.
Ashley: All right, all right, bad idea.
Sam: But if I am Polymorphed as a goliath, would I gain their-- all their abilities and--
Matt: Their movement speed, yes.
Sam: Intelligence?
Matt: Yeah. It's everything--
Taliesin: So why not just look like them and if you need to you can make a bubble?
Liam: You know what would make you move pretty fast is a lady rogue with a flying broom.
Laura: That's true, I could be hiding behind you and drag you.
Taliesin: Could have a rope tied to him.
Matt: However, Polymorph is any beast form, if I recall.
Sam: It can't be a man? He's not a beast, that guy?
Matt: A "beast." Yeah, this, you'd be looking at more of an illusion-based spell like Alter Self.
Sam: Oh, well I don't have that. Oh, I have the hat, but it doesn't make me grow, does it?
Matt: No, you'd be a very, very tiny goliath.
Liam: Maybe they'd think it was perspective fuckery like in the Lord of the Rings movies.
Sam: Well, backup plan, I can go in as dead Reginald.
Liam: His dad is much better.
Sam: They killed him, they just killed him, Kevdak's son killed him, Kevdak's son knows who he is.
Marisha: No. They don't care.
Sam: Sure he does, they just killed him two days ago.
Taliesin: Can you remember who you killed two days ago?
Sam: I can, I remember all of them because I barely kill anybody.
Taliesin: Oh, well, that's fair. I don't think they care who he is.
Travis: Right.
Taliesin: I think you showing up at the front doors is the best option at this point.
Marisha: Scanlan, can you do it with an illusion instead of an actual, physical person? Just an illusion?
Sam: My illusions are small in size. I mean, I could just go in as hey, I'm Mr. Scanlan, come chase after me.
Travis: This is your trick. You pick.
Laura: You could be a fucking triceratops again, for all--
Sam: Are they going to chase after a triceratops, though?
Marisha: It could make theoretical sense if you're still undead Stonejaw, because, you know, decomposition I'm sure shrinks you a little bit.
Ashley: What's something that they would chase after?
Liam: Grog.
Travis: Anything that moves.
Marisha: While you guys figure it out, I'm going to start digging a trench.
Taliesin: I'll help. I'm going to get some--
Marisha: No no no, I'm good. I'm good. You stay. I don't want to blow our cover, I'm going to do this all underground.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: So outside of the city I'm going to start digging underground and I'm going to start digging a trench.
Matt: All right. So you're using Move Earth?
Marisha: I'm moving earth, I'm going to go underground. And it lasts up to two hours.
Matt: You're going underground to do it?
Marisha: I want to go underground and tunnel towards--
Matt: Okay, I see, and then create like the trench tunnel underneath, okay.
Marisha: And do-- and I want to make it really thin to where there's a nice thin layer of earth, and then I want to make it really deep.
Matt: Okay, Move Earth is a concentration up to two hours.
Marisha: Uh-huh, and I can concentrate on a 40-square-foot for ten minutes. And each ten minutes I can change it.
Matt: If you're doing a 40-foot square it could be like 20 feet lower for every 40-foot square you can do, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah. Yeah. So real deep.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say over the two-hour period you could create, for a 40-foot square, like a hundred feet deep, 120 feet deep--
Marisha: I want to make sure it's wide enough to cover the whole entrance as well.
Matt: The whole entrance? Okay. So you dig underneath. Stealth check to get close enough. Because in digging, it'll take you most of that duration to dig up to the gate.
Marisha: Uh-huh. Underground.
Matt: Yeah. I'd say, so in order to do this, you have to actually get fairly close before you start digging down there.
Marisha: I rolled a 19.
Matt: 19?
Marisha: And I have a stealth of 11.
Matt: Okay. All right, so. You make your way up there, moving through the grass best you can. The guards that are there are partially (yawns) coming to, you begin to slowly manipulate downward into the ground using a relatively untouched patch of high grass for cover, and pushing your way through. Over the next two hours, you manage to dig a ditch, the width of this entrance is about 40 feet.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So from end to end, if you just go straight down from there at 20 feet per section every ten minutes, looking at 240 feet deep if you wanted to go the full, although, actually, having to tunnel underneath would probably take-- we'll say 180 feet.
Marisha: 180 feet. That'll do.
Laura: Oh my god, that's amazing.
Marisha: And I can make the ground thin enough to where it's not going to support weight, yeah?
Matt: Yeah, you give yourself enough of a buffer where yeah, you could, might require a bit of a jolt, make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Ah, jeez Louise. Ooh. 19.
Matt: Okay. You feel pretty confident that you've left just enough of a surface that it would support a little bit of weight and maintain its placement. But upon the weight of maybe two humanoid-sized individuals, it would probably crumble beneath.
Marisha: Cool. Cool cool cool. Did I get a little black powder from you?
Taliesin: I did, I gave you a little bit of black powder.
Marisha: Can I put a little black powder in the top of the dirt?
Matt: What is a little bit?
Marisha: Whatever he gave me.
Taliesin: I have a little bit left over. I gave her a third of a barrel worth, like twice this.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So I pepper it in the top, where if it gets hit it's going to go boom.
Taliesin: I'm going to have to deal with it eventually, but I'm fine at the moment.
Matt: Okay. All right. You pepper it on the earth from underneath. Okay.
Marisha: Maybe it works. Maybe. I don't know.
Taliesin: If it's hit by lightning it should be fine.
Marisha: Okay, okay.
Liam: So Grog's father's too big for you, what about the undead severed head of Grog's father?
Sam: I can make an image of that.
Liam: Floating about in the air with Pike's boots.
Laura: Oh my gosh, a floating severed head?
Liam: Saying nasty, nasty, nasty things at the Herd.
Sam: I can do that.
Travis: But he can't move if he's wearing the boots.
Taliesin: He'll be tied to a rope. You can make it move when it's time.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Could you pull him like a balloon?
Sam: I can make the head move.
Marisha: Can you be a floating head inside of a hamster ball?
Sam: I wouldn't need to be the head, I mean, I can't make my body look like a head.
Liam: You can't? I thought you could do anything.
Laura: But you can make the illusion of a head talking.
Sam: I can make the illusion of a head talking. Wizard of Oz-style.
Liam: Can it follow you about?
Marisha: Well, he can be on a roof.
Sam: It would be within 60 feet of me, I think.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: Minor Illusion, I guess.
Matt: Minor Illusion, you could, it's a very minor illusion.
Sam: I know.
Matt: But you could make noise escape from the vicinity of where the head is.
Taliesin: Could I assist with that?
Sam: Because he has Minor Illusion as well.
Matt: If you're close enough to it, it's possible.
Sam: I could also do-- these goliaths, they don't like wyverns. I could be a wyvern.
Laura: The head is so perfect.
Liam: You could be a whole wyvern, but you can't be a goliath?
Sam: It's not a beast, apparently.
Matt: Yeah. Polymorph-- there are higher-level spells that can let you it, but they're a little out of your range.
Sam: A wyvern is a beast?
Taliesin: Okay, we can do the head.
Laura: The head. Be a head! Be a giant, floating, severed head, I like it.
Taliesin: Can you get me out of there once they come to attack?
Laura: Me?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: I mean, I can use the tether and tie you to the broom.
Taliesin: I'll be the bait.
Matt: A wyvern is a dragon, it is not a beast.
Sam: Huh?
Matt: A wyvern is a dragon, it is not a beast.
Sam: I cannot be a wyvern.
Taliesin: I can be the bait.
Marisha: With the hat? With your hat?
Ashley: How are you going to be the bait?
Sam: Yeah, how are you going to be the bait?
Taliesin: I'm going to have the severed head of your father talking to them.
Sam: Yes, I can do that too, and I can escape. You can't.
Taliesin: Up to you. All right.
Laura: Do it.
Liam: Do it, Scanlan, do it.
Laura: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: I mean, I can try. Might be shit. How are you going to hide?
Travis: Can I ask this? Let's say we pick this gate where she's digging out this ditch. What is the terrain like on the outside of the wall next to that gate?
Matt: Because of the building, or the structure of it for about 30 feet on the outside of the wall it's mainly just hard-packed dirt and earth from patrols for hundreds of years going around the wall, whether it be carts, beasts of burden, or just people walking all around the outskirts of the town of Westruun, it's very heavy-packed and often-walked earth.
Travis: Zero cover.
Matt: Zero coverage within 30 feet of it, and the grass does thin as it gets close to that. Keyleth had to pick a specific area and get low and even then had to force her way under and use a good, you know, a quarter of her spell time to be able to dig well enough to get past that space.
Travis: Past 30 feet from the wall, from the edge of town, what kind of cover is there? Is there any?
Matt: Not really.
Travis: Not even the tall grass?
Matt: The grass at that point gets about waist- to knee-high, even less so.
Travis: This is an important thing we need to remember. As we're doing all this, let's just assume that we're us and this'll all go tits-up real quick. We're going to be a fucking long way away from you before we can come to help.
Sam: That's why you're going to send Pike with me. No, I'm just kidding, I would never.
Liam: No, but my sister or I could go with you. One of us.
Sam: That would make me feel quite nice.
Taliesin: Sister's good for an escape route.
Travis: We should at least find a forward operating base, a place where we can watch this unfold from cover and figure out how far away we are from the first act of our show.
Taliesin: Well, if everything goes wrong we meet back here at the very least.
Marisha: I mean, theoretically we'll be stationed throughout, and we'll have our earpieces, correct?
Taliesin: Yeah, but I'm just talking about, what if we have to para-rescue his ass out of a fucking pickle?
Taliesin: That's what Vex is for.
Laura: I'm standing nearby on my broom. I'll fly in and pick him up. He can Dimension Door out, though, very quickly.
Marisha: I also have both of my beast shaping, still, so I can always fly in and evac you.
Travis: How far away are we from the entrance now?
Matt: As you guys have plotted this, and Keyleth has come back to you through the grass after creating this tunnel, I'd say you're about 150, 200 feet out.
Taliesin: That's perfect.
Sam: And we know Westruun.
Matt: Yeah, you know it well.
Sam: And I know how far away from the center of town are we--
Travis: Wait a minute, are there sewers in Westruun?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: It's okay.
Travis: I don't know.
Taliesin: We have that option if it comes to it.
Travis: Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
Taliesin: It's all right. And again, like any good plan, everything will go wrong.
Laura: Yes.
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: Let's do it!
Taliesin: It's time.
Matt: The grass dies, begins to die away, and become in-- not helpful for stealth about 80, 70-80 feet outside the wall.
Marisha: Can we get a Pass Without a Trace while we all get to our positions?
Laura: Fuck yeah.
Matt: Okay. Pass Without a Trace, even so, you can't stealth in the open. In order to stealth, you have to have some way of staying out of sight. Once you get to about 70 feet from the wall, it's basically just open ground and the large wall that surrounds Westruun.
Marisha: I could give us a fog cloud.
Laura: Can you dig a hole under and we can hang out in a hole with something over top of it so we can bust up out, like shallow ground?
Marisha: I've already burned it. I mean, we can still go underground, I have a tunnel built to a certain point.
Laura: But we have to be able to get out of it.
Taliesin: Let's just keep our distance, let's get them out of the castle and coming out at us.
Laura: Okay. And then we go in.
Matt: Okay. So. What's the plan? Who's doing what?
Sam: I go invisible and start walking into town.
Laura: We stay at the very edge, stealthed as fuck.
Taliesin: You're not going into town, why are you going into town? We dug a giant pit in front of the main entrance.
Marisha: Yeah, everyone be mindful of the pit, I point it out to everyone where the pit is so we can go around it.
Matt: Okay. To be fair, yeah, and he is a gnome. He is not a very heavy individual. And you were pretty spot-on-- You're fairly certain it can support the weight of a gnome.
Marisha: I can Polymorph a couple people. No. Sorry. I can Polymorph one person as a stealth kind of deal.
Matt: There are the three guards there, about 20 feet in from the main gate, or the main entranceway, one of which appears to be a female goliath, muscular scar-based torso, very thick, dark, dreaded hair that's pulled tightly to the back of her head and hangs down to the mid-back, and you see two humans that are also as rugged-looking, possibly members of the secondary tribe that they adopted, as was mentioned when you first inquired about the tribe as it currently stands, the Herd. They're all just looking out, bored, one of them is chewing on some dried meat, and they're just keeping an eye out. Scanlan, you've gone invisible and you're approaching the front gate. What are you doing?
Sam: Hey, can you cast Pass Without a Trace on me?
Laura: I already did!
Sam: Okay, good. I'm just going to walk in, straight into town.
Matt: Okay. Yeah. Just for the sake of this, go ahead and make a stealth check. With advantage.
Sam: With advantage.
Matt: Yeah, they have very little chance to even notice.
Sam: So 16 plus--
Laura: Ten.
Sam: Plus two. So 28.
Matt: Yeah. Given the circumstance that you're invisible and that advantage roll, even the quietness of your footsteps, you manage to literally walk within five feet of them without them noticing. You hear some low mutters, some of it's just like broken words, "Stupid hungry--" And the larger female goliath is like, "Shut up. Eyes peeled. I hate this." They look very unhappy about having to be stuck there at this watch. So you've moved past them, now.
Sam: All right, I'm going to go into the-- just the center. We had a scouting party go in and see that-- yes we did, yes we did. It was the center of town, and that's where the key people were around, milling about.
Matt: Yeah, the very center of town is about a 15-minute walk from the outside of town.
Taliesin: We can hear everything that happens.
Matt: How long does your invisibility last?
Sam: An hour.
Matt: An hour. Okay. You start coasting through the town, you come towards a T-intersection of where the road continues forward and turns to the right, you can see a number of the buildings, just like you saw previously on you guys' journey, some of them are charred and black from fires that have been set. Some of them, you do notice as you pass by, large elements of the buildings have just dissolved, melted down by some sort of chemical reaction. Many buildings still stand. You do see that there are broken barrels and crates in the streets, it looks like a lot of what may have been in storage or being brought around as commerce has been ransacked and raided or relocated. You do see a couple carts that are half-broken or just up on the side, with whatever's on the inside pulled out. You do manage to see a couple of horses that were killed during some altercation that were just left rotting in the middle of the street. There are no people visible on the street. Make a perception check.
Laura: What time is it?
Matt: At this point now? In the two hours for you to do that digging, it's close to 10:30, 11:00 in the morning.
Sam: 13.
Matt: 13. Okay. You keep walking past, you don't notice anything that catches your attention. You keep moving towards the center of the town. You start moving through the religious district of the middle of Westruun. Make another perception check.
Sam: 19.
Taliesin: Plus.
Sam: Nothing.
Matt: 19. You glance by what you knew previously in Westruun as the central church of Erathis there. It's a rather, in comparison to the rest of the town, a gaudy temple. But it has been defiled fairly heavily. You can see paint, mud, or some other substance has been smeared across parts of it, portions of the rock have been pushed over and collapsed. You do glance and see a small humanoid peeking through one of the ajar doors that you see, for a second you see a set of eyes, then it sees you and closes the door.
Laura: It saw you?
Sam: Oh, shit. Fuck, he knows I'm there, I got to keep going. I got to keep going, yeah.
Laura: You're invisible!
Sam: Yeah. (laughs) Yeah.
Matt: You keep moving towards the very, very center of town, moving past a couple of other patrols. You've passed, even in just this journey into the center of-- journey to the center of Westruun-- you've passed roughly 30 or so well-armed, relatively savage individuals that mark the same civilized level of Grog, give or take some further steps into society. Many of them are wearing pieces of clothing that have been taken from this town, they're dressed better than their station, you know, rough-looking, big, thick, unshaven faces for the humans, but they're still like dressed in pompous clothing that's partially torn and smeared. They're a walking parody of the people that once ruled this town, and they seem to know it. They're enjoying this gloating. Eventually you make your way to the central town square, which is not far from where the Margrave's home is. This area, you do notice, has been set up as a defensive central location. There are just barriers and barricades of all sorts of furniture that have been nailed together and this has been made an assault post, where if anyone were to attempt to attack the center of this town, this would be a wonderful defensive position for someone to hole up and wait it out, whether it be against other people or a dragon. It has been built with the best of their ability in that regard. And there are a number of weapons that they've taken from the city that have been bolted in, that have been strapped around, so there's just like jagged edges of halberds and whatever blades they could muster in every direction, therefore if anything wasn't being very careful and running through here, they could be easily shoved into one of these hazards or perhaps even pushed onto it as a means of display. Which you do notice, on a number of these, various heads are currently placed as warning symbols, in varying states of decay. You recognize two of the heads. One of which is--
Laura: No no no no no.
Matt: Sorry. One of them you recognize as the Margrave who once ruled Westruun, whose home Kevdak currently keeps as his own. And the other, let's see if I can recall what this one is. I have it written down here.
Taliesin: I like that this is that deep in your notes, is which heads are on spikes.
Matt: Hey, man, got to keep up with this.
Sam: Appendix A  Heads on Spikes, Various.
Matt: (laughs) Pretty much.
Sam: Subappendix  Westruun.
Matt: Ah, okay, here we go. Here we go. Okay. Loran the Bear. Loran the Bear was a mercenary that you guys faced off with the first time that you fought in the brawlers' league. You guys had a playful rivalry? You kept running into each other when looking for various--
Taliesin: It's like a best of season one, that's great.
Sam: The season that didn't air.
Taliesin: The season that didn't air.
Matt: But there you see him, or what remains of him, placed on one of these weapons. It looks like anybody who has attempted to rise up or at least make a stink about the current ruling class in Westruun have been put on display in this square in some way, shape, or form.
Sam: Are there any people? Guards? Goliaths?
Matt: You see a rather heavy group of well-armored goliaths and other savage-looking humanoid individuals. Mostly human, you see a couple half-orcs, but it's a total of ten of them that are all currently scattered throughout this central area, some of them just sitting down, snacking, a few that are just keeping watch, and a number that are hovering in and out of the door of the main area, giving orders and carrying some small supplies around.
Sam: Okay. So I'll just quickly-- are you guys ready?
Marisha: Do we want to get up on the wall? There's like a wall, right, around the city?
Sam: Yeah, but I'm in the center of the city.
Matt: Right. Also, there's no response.
Laura: Oh, he's out of range. Shit.
Sam: Do you know what the range is on that?
Matt: The range on those earpieces are roughly two miles.
Sam: Two miles.
Laura: He's out of two miles' range?
Matt: Well yeah, Westruun's a pretty big town, and it's--
Laura: It's a 15-minute walk, though.
Sam: Yeah, I walk fast.
Laura: You're a fast walker for a gnome.
Marisha: He really is a really fast walker.
Taliesin: Okay, go ahead.
Marisha: I cast Polymorph on Percy and turn him into a crow.
Taliesin: (eerily good crow noise)
Laura: Oh, again with the crows.
Marisha: Also, I use my beast shape to go into a crow. (crow noise)
Taliesin: (eerily good crow noise)
Marisha: (crow noise)
Taliesin: That's good enough, that's good.
Marisha: And we fly to the walls and perch on opposite sides on the entrance.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Look, your god is here to help us.
Marisha: (crow noises)
Laura: She sounds like shit.
Marisha: (a panoply of crow noises)
Taliesin: (a panoply of crow noises)
Matt: Stop it.
Taliesin: Sorry. (laughter)
Taliesin: It's really pleasing.
Matt: All right. You guys are perched on the edges of that. Scanlan, what're you doing?
Sam: So much. So much.
Laura: I feel like this is the first time I've seen you at a loss.
Travis: Look at those eyes.
Laura: Oh god.
Taliesin: Don't you want her to read the note?
Sam: Yeah, I go over to where the most people are congregated.
Matt: That's going to be right at the steps of the Margrave's manor.
Sam: I position myself about seven feet away from them.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And I cast Thunderwave.
Matt: And with that, (explosion), this burst of thunder comes blasting out centrally from where you are located, Scanlan. The DC on this, with your--
Sam: Thunderwave. Oh, is it spell?
Matt: It's spell, what's your DC?
Sam: 20.
Matt: 20.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Matt: Okay. Six fail, one succeeds on this save. So you hit them and they're all forced backwards, some of them up onto the stairs, some against the wall. Roll 2d8 points of damage.
Liam: Ragdoll physics.
Sam: 2d8?
Matt: Mm-hmm.
Sam: No, it's-- oh, that's, you're right.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: 11 plus something? No, I guess it's just 11.
Matt: It's just 11. All right, and one of them takes five points of damage and (impact sound) looks down at this little gnome that's there.
Sam: No, no, I'm still invisible. It's not a concentration spell.
Matt: Invisibility, I'm pretty sure that as soon as you do--
Sam: Oh, fuck.
Matt: The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.
Sam: Casts a spell?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Even though it's a concentration spell?
Matt: Yeah, you can cast other instantaneous spells, but as soon as you cast a spell you become visible.
Sam: What?
Matt: High-level invisibility, improved invisibility is the one that remains.
Sam: Oh well, I'm fucked, then. (laughter)
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: I'll say, do you have Greater Invisibility?
Sam: No. I can cast it at a greater level, but no, I don't have Greater Invisibility.
Matt: Yeah, at that moment you suddenly become visible.
Taliesin: Roll with it, roll with it.
Sam: Hi guys. Hi.
Marisha: But you're Scanlan, you can do this.
Matt: The surprise round, they weren't expecting it. Roll initiative right now.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Laura: Oh my god, Scanlan, run.
Sam: 16.
Matt: Rolled a one. I'm rolling them group initiative on this one, because I don't want to roll six different initiatives in this order. They all look at you dumbfounded. "We got an intruder!" Pull out their weapons, get ready. Two of them (growl) at you really angrily. What are you doing?
Sam: Fuck!
Matt: What are you doing, Sam?
Sam: This is not the plan!
Taliesin: No! No!
Travis: Don't say a thing, don't say shit.
Laura: Okay, yeah yeah, it's all you.
Sam: (mock-crying) At least I know that Pike didn't read the letter, though, so I'm okay. (laughter)
Taliesin: At the end of this fight, can I have your tie? I mean, you're not going to need it anymore.
Travis: Come on, what are you doing?
Sam: Okay. I'll Dimension Door into the house where the guy's eyeballs were.
Travis: Yes! I like it.
Matt: Wait, on the, to the house--
Sam: The house where I saw the guy who was peeking and saw me, he saw me, I'm going in there.
Matt: Oh!
Laura: What?
Liam: Smart.
Matt: How far is the range on Dimension Door?
Sam: 500 feet. Was that long ago or recently?
Matt: Wait, so. You were peeking, are you referring to the--
Sam: The guy who saw me as invisible.
Matt: Right. Okay, got you. All right, so you're going to that temple. That's probably about 1000 feet from you, you can Dimension Door closer to it.
Sam: Yes, I could. I could. Okay, okay. This is exciting, this is so exciting, nothing's working. Okay, yes, I will go toward it 500 feet.
Matt: Okay. You appear to the back end and around the road, just around the corner from where the entrance to that area is, so you're a little ways away. As you appear, catching your breath, you look over your shoulder and you hear in the distance more, a couple yells, and a bell starts going off (ringing) in the center of the town square.
Sam: It's going great, guys.
Laura: Do we hear the bell?
Matt: You guys can hear in the very distance a series of bells beginning to go (ringing).
Taliesin: Oh, sweet Jesus.
Matt: What're you doing now?
Sam: Well, they haven't caught up to me, right?
Matt: No no, you just moved 500 feet in one second, they have no idea where you went. You just showed up, went "Bye!" and vanished out.
Liam: Bell is bad. He's in trouble, we need to go in now.
Sam: I'm going to go again, Dimension Door into the temple.
Matt: Okay, you do see the temple. You're on the interior of it now, and looking inside you know a portion of it is collapsed, there's an open view on the second level where a whole corner of the secondary floor and first floor have fallen in, big pile of rubble, you can see the sky. There as you appear, you look around, you hear a series of gasps as you can now see huddled inside of this temple roughly 30 or so people, varying ages, varying racial backgrounds. These are some of the survivors in Westruun that are keeping in here, whether it be hidden, or at least this is where they live now. They look in various states of personal brutality that's been put against them, some of them are wounded, a few of them draw weapons immediately, and turning around, you see hunkered down inside a half-orc that rushes around, his hat half-kilter, his coat up with his shoulder, mantle part of his collar pressed upward, spins around, puts his blade out. "You've got to be kidding me. Scanlan Shorthalt."
Sam: That's me.
Matt: As Dr. Dranzel stands there before you. (cheering)
Matt: They themselves look a little worse for wear, and he looks over his shoulder and says, "Well shit, Kaylie, weren't you just talking about him yesterday?" As your daughter stands behind him, holding two of the children, trying to protect them as you appeared. She looks up at you and goes, "Oh, you've got to be kidding me." And that's where we'll end tonight's game. (yelling)
Travis: Perfect! Perfect, perfect.
Taliesin: Put that on like a Japanese businessman.
Liam: By the way, this one, under her breath, goes, "Oh I don't like him, he stole from me."
Sam: That's all you can think about?
Laura: Why am I cheering? He stole from us.
Sam: They're going to fucking save my life.
Liam: Well, maybe he needed it to save the world.
Matt: It's all survival. All right, then we'll pick it up from there next week.
Travis: Jesus. That was a hell of a 50th. Fuck's sake!
Taliesin: Why did we even bother to plan?
Taliesin: Why do we even bother to plan?
Marisha: Why do we even bother to plan?
Travis: It's going perfect! It's going perfectly. We are still on the rails. It is working.
Taliesin: We are still on the rails, it'll be great.
Marisha: I spent a 6th-level spell building that trench, it had better come in handy.
Ashley: It will, it will.
Taliesin: We're all going to fall and die in it, it's going to be great.
Liam: Scanlan is drunken master.
Matt: All righty, guys, we're going to go ahead and take a few minutes here to hunker down and prepare for the savage unwrapping of many presents that you, the community of Critical Role, have put in our direction. All of us so eternally undeserving, but so incredibly appreciative of all that you guys do, both to help with the charities that we support and spend your time being so awesome and creative and we're going to go ahead and--
Sam: Matt, though, but what are we going to do with the minutes while we're not on camera right now? How do we fill the airtime?
Matt: We'll, I'm sure, have a few videos to show that may also include our new intro.
Taliesin: Again! Again!
Marisha: Again! Again!
Laura: Again! Again!
Marisha: We're mainly doing this for our own selfishness. [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons. So, welcome. I know we had a two-week hiatus. We had some birthdays-- in fact, the twins had a birthday. (cheering)
Matt: Awesome. A lot of really amazing community art came out of it, because you guys are ridiculous, and we'll probably see some of that at the break today. But before we kick into the game, let's get through our announcements for the evening while we also wait for Mr. Sam Riegel, Scanlan, who I think we all can consider is pretty important to tonight's events, seeing as how he's currently being digested in the belly of the dragon.
Laura: Oh shit!
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: That didn't happen.
Matt: Yes it did. Yes it did. No. So. Starting off our announcements for the evening: first off, I am going to be flying out bright and early tomorrow morning to A-Kon in Dallas. I'll be out there doing panels and signings with a bunch of other great guests. I understand the same weekend is also Dallas Comic Con, because what the fuck, Dallas? At which Mary and Steve are there also, so don't choose: come to both! No.
Travis: Wade the waters.
Matt: Exactly. But I'll be doing signings, panels, and meeting a bunch of you Critters that are out in that area, so come by and say hi this weekend. And if not, go say hi to Steve and Mary, wherever that happens, in the lesser part of Dallas. I don't know if it is, I just like--
Travis: Yeah, there's a lesser part of Dallas, totally, over with the lesser-- are you guys throwing up because of how nervous you are?
Laura: What? No. Oh, my dice! Where are my dice?!
Matt: Where are your dice?
Laura: I'm so nervous, I don't even have my dice!
Travis: I'll go find them, I'll go find them.
Matt: Travis is going to get them. Wow. Two weeks to stew on this and it's already falling apart.
Liam: This is the exact icy, steely demeanor that I depend on.
Laura: Oh my god, are they in there?
Matt: While he looks for those--
Taliesin: I have extras, if you need some.
Matt: I do want to also say the newest Dear Abby article series for Critical Role characters went up-- or goes up tomorrow, right?
Marisha: Tomorrow, Fridays.
Matt: Friday. And whose is that one?
Marisha: Who goes up next?
Laura: What? Who goes up what next?
Matt: The next Dear Abby?
Laura: Oh, I think it's me!
Matt: Oh! Then we'll have Vex tomorrow coming up. See her answering questions to various distraught people throughout the realms of Exandria, and her I'm sure very astute--
Laura: I'm a really good giver of advice. I learned that about myself.
Ashley: It's true.
Liam: More about quantity than quality? Maybe?
Matt: Possibly. This is very true. So look for that tomorrow on geekandsundry.com, that'll be fun and exciting. Also, for those who didn't catch it yesterday, we had an awesome event at Meltdown Comics with the official Dungeons & Dragons crew announcing: one, their new storyline, which is the Storm King's Thunder, I think is what it's called. Really awesome, bringing the giants back into the world with a very fleshed-out story. I'm super excited about it, and keep tabs on that whenever that comes out, should be in the next few months, I think. I've seen some stuff behind-the-scenes and it looks really, really cool. But as part of that event yesterday, we also kicked off and announced a new video series campaign that I'm doing with the actual Wizards of the Coast Dungeons & Dragons team. Me and Chris Perkins wrote and designed together a story that I fleshed out and am running for a series of celebrity guests, one of which is our fantastic Ashley Johnson there.
Ashley: Hey!
Laura: You're a celebrity!
Marisha: You're a celebrity!
Matt: That was pretty great, guys. I'm not going to lie, that was pretty legit.
Liam: Just keep vamping. Keep vamping until the bard gets here.
Matt: That's right, we're waiting on Scanlan to get here. Other guests include Utkarsh, Shelby, Jonah-- I wrote all the first names down because the last names, some of them were hard to pronounce, but you can look up the actual announcements to get the full names. I'm really bad at this. It's been two weeks, give me a break.
Liam: You're busy. You're busy.
Matt: Nah! I've got so much free time. But it's going to be a great group, and I look forward to announcing it soon on when those will begin to air throughout the summer, because it's going to be a lot of fun. And I get to play in Forgotten Realms, which is something I've wanted to do again for a long time, and hope I don't mess up all the existing fantastic lore that Ed Greenwood has developed since he-- oh, are you okay, Laura?
Laura: No, I really feel like I'm going to throw up.
Travis: There's literally up-chuck going to happen. Just do it in a little thing and I'll feed it back to you like a little bird
Liam: Just go in there.
Laura: (retching noise) I threw up so many dice!
Travis: I'll talk about our sponsor this week.
Matt: You want to jump into that? Yeah, so we have a new sponsor coming in, sponsoring this episode of Critical Role this evening. (cheering)
Matt: So Travis, you want to take it away?
Travis: Our amazing sponsor this week is Backblaze. Backblaze is an amazing, unlimited cloud backup company for your Mac and PC, for just five dollars a month, it's incredible. We have an amazing representative from Backblaze in the studio. He's a crazy, crazy uber-fan. Yev, wave to me baby, blow me a kiss. He's incredible.
Laura: You should check out his Twitter page because he has printed out Flat Mercer and he's chronicling his adventures, and I'm pretty proud of it.
Travis: Yes! We're on you, we're talking about Backblaze right now.
Sam: Hey guys. Backblaze is a great service. (laughter)
Sam: It offers unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just five dollars a month. They're supporting the show tonight. I was saying this in the car on the way over. (laughter)
Matt: Well, please continue, we're not stopping you.
Sam: Guys, no shit, I just installed it yesterday on my home computer. It's currently backing up right now. It's an online file backup system for all your stuff. Your documents, your media, your Critical Role fanart, your videos of Scanlan singing things. There's no gimmicks or additional charges, it's just five dollars a month, and! You don't want to go to Backblaze.com, you want to go to backblaze.com/criticalrole, where you can get a fully-featured 15-day trial.
Travis: How many days, Sam?
Sam: 15 days, free! If you like it, keep getting it, pay five bucks a month, that's nothing. Or if you don't, whatever, it doesn't bother me. But it's only for Critters, and also if you go to backblaze.com/criticalrole right now, you'll see pictures of us, quotes from us. It's actually really cute.
Taliesin: Yeah, it was pretty cute.
Sam: And I am such a supporter of these guys that I even wrote a song for them.
Marisha: What?
Sam: It's very short. Okay.
Matt: Please, go ahead.
Sam: (singing) I'm backing up in Backblaze of glory! Take me now, download the truth. I'm backing up-- okay, that's it. (cheering)
Sam: I need a drink now.
Matt: You did good Sam, you did good.
Laura: There's some Guinness in the fridge.
Matt: It's been cool having sponsors come to the show, partially because they all come to us from being fans of the actual show, and that's the driving force behind this, so we want to make sure that things are on-brand from people who are genuinely interested in our community and have things to offer that'll be useful. I can say this as I have a web series I directed many years ago and spent a whole year doing, I lost all the files because of the hard drive that I had-- the external hard drive failed, and I don't have any of those anymore. And so since then I've been very, very careful about backing everything up. So this service would have been really helpful back then. So don't make the same mistakes I did. There Will Be Brawl only lives as final video files. It kills me. I couldn't even fix stuff. Still have the watermark on the last three videos for the Escapist that I can't remove. Anyway. Learn from my mistakes. So! Do we have anything else any of you folks want to announce?
Laura: E3's next week!
Matt: E3 is next week.
Laura: Oh wait, no it's not. It's two weeks from now.
Matt: No, it's two weeks from now.
Laura: It's two weeks from now. I'm sorry.
Matt: I believe nothing coming out of that mouth now!
Taliesin: E3 is two weeks from now, and I'm also going to be at Amazing Comic Con Vegas two weeks from now. And Signal Boost is currently in its second week, which is hilarious, and amazing, and you should totally check it out because it's weird.
Marisha: Yeah. You're like the most interesting man in the world.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: It's fantastic.
Laura: I've always thought that about you, Taliesin.
Taliesin: Oh. Thanks. I'm now... yeah. I'm going to die today, thank you. (laughter)
Laura: No you're not!
Travis: Pike's got us covered. Right, Pike?
Matt: All right, great. So, without further ado, and no further delaying the inevitable--
Travis: You got a little something on your--
Matt: Little thing on my nose, right there?
Travis: You might need to go the bathroom, check it out.
Matt: No, it's great. So let's go ahead and roll the intro and start playing Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: So. Continuing where we left off two weeks ago. The intrepid party of adventurers known as Vox Machina, after recently freeing the town of Westruun from being occupied and ruled by the roving Herd of the Storm, which Grog once hailed from, cut down their brutal leader Kevdak and temporarily restored power to a combination of himself and Kevdak's son, Zanror. An accord was made between the two of you to agree to go after and destroy the ancient black dragon Umbrasyl, a member of the Chroma Conclave, and marked for you to eventually destroy anyway, but who had currently made a deal with the Herd in exchange for goods, gold, and ruling over the town, would let them live and be essentially undisturbed, seemingly. You gathered an army, you forged a plan, and an ambush was set for the next time the dragon swooped down from atop the mountain Gatshadow to retrieve its package. At this time, the trap was sprung, the dragon held fast by hooks and chains, a giant metallic trap designed and orchestrated by Percival, and everything was going great. The dragon had sustained quite a bit of damage and seemed to be in a rough place until it broke free and left much of the Herd fallen, dissolving and screaming. Also, Scanlan and Vax Dimension Door'd into the inside of the dragon and have spent a number of rounds now deciding how to get out of it maybe?
Sam: Tiny Vax. Tiny Vax.
Matt: Tiny Vax. Thanks to a potion that does that. You managed to go ahead and put in an Immovable Rod within its stomach, which held it up for a moment before it decided to truly gain the advantage it needed to escape the circumstance, allowed it to tear through its body, as well as an arrow that was shot by Vex towards her brother, in hopes of-- I don't know, being a signal of hope or to put him out of his misery? I'm still trying to figure it out. At this point in time, Umbrasyl took to the sky and began to coast off towards Gatshadow, seemingly the domain that it's carved for itself in this region. On its way out, Grog had thrown his newly acquired Bloodaxe and his Chain of Returning into the dragon, left it, and is now being dragged behind it now, dangling as it flies off. And that, my friends, is where we kick back into the story.
Travis: That's when they knew they fucked up. (laughter)
Matt: So we have, as you guys-- Grog, your feet leave the ground as you swing forward, unable by the momentum pushing forward to keep up with the sheer speed of this dragon and its size, its mass, its full stretched wings, it is far faster than any of you expected and it whooshes off towards the mountaintop. You, just looking behind as the ground just fades further and further away. The rest of you, Vox Machina, seeing this happen, see essentially half of your friends, your party, only one of them visible, now beyond your reach. With that being said, for this circumstance, let's pick up where we were on the initiative order between you three.
Laura: Just straight into it!
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I'm ready.
Matt: We left at the right time for that, guys.
Liam: I cannot feel the lower half of my body. (laughter)
Matt: Here, how about this? Because I can't find the original initiative order, we'll just say for this circumstance we'll roll initiative based on what action's going to happen here. So we're going to have you three roll initiative.
Travis: Come on, lucky dice. I get advantage on that.
Sam: I got 12.
Liam: 13.
Travis: 13 also.
Laura: Oh jeez.
Sam: Starting off right.
Matt: All right. So. As it crests into the sky (whoosh), blackish dragon blood dripping from wounds, you can feel every single tension of its upper torso muscles with each swoop of the wings crushing against you in this rhythmic pattern. What little bit of air currently has been placed at the top of the stomach, based on your Thunderwave, is all you have to maintain any semblance of hope. You, there's an arrow in darkness. However, Umbrasyl at this point, who does go first in this order, is just concentrating on survival and continues gliding upward. You hear a rumble within the inside of the body, and the essence of a growling, angry voice creeps through. "These foul creatures. Get out of me!" (straining sound) I need you guys to both roll strength saving throws right now.
Laura: He's trying to puke you up?
Sam: Or just crush us.
Liam: Strength saving? Nine.
Sam: Yeah, not great. 15.
Matt: 15. You manage to put your arms against the side, and using whatever forceful arcane cantrips to keep the walls at bay before it actually finds you, and you slip out in time. You, however, do suffer six points of bludgeoning damage as the muscles once again tense against you. Umbrasyl is very much aware that there are now living things inside the stomach squirming around and as the muscles relax, the voice just growls again, "Try all you want. Don't worry. I can eat you now or later."
Liam: Can't hear you.
Matt: So. We had two 13s and a--
Sam: 12.
Matt: 12. All right. So Grog, Vax, what are you guys doing?
Liam: I'm taking--
Matt: The Bramblewood is now beneath you, you're heading towards the mountain, you can see the edge of the forest now.
Travis: Maybe I go first, just in case something--
Liam: Yeah, go for it.
Travis: The Bramblewood? I'm holding on, right? With the Titanstone Knuckles. Whereabouts is the axe lodged? Can I see where the chain is attached to?
Matt: You can see it curving up ahead of you and with how high the sun is in the sky, it's around noon, there's a heavy bit of shadow, and at this distance? Make a perception check.
Travis: (laughs) That went one and then a 13. Minus-- zero. 13.
Matt: 13. It seems to be somewhere around the base of the tail, like where the tail meets the rest of the actual body itself, the torso area.
Laura: It's in his butt.
Matt: No, it's not quite in his butt, it's more in his side.
Travis: How high am I?
Matt: Looking down? Numbers are hard for you to pick up. It's a long way.
Travis: A long way.
Matt: It's a long way. Like-- yeah.
Travis: Well. Only one way to go. And that's up. I would like to try and pull myself up the chain towards Umbrasyl.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: Athletics or strength?
Matt: Athletics. Which is better, technically.
Laura: It's a strength saving thing, so--
Matt: Yeah, it's strength plus your proficiency bonus.
Travis: Oh! I get an advantage or?
Matt: You get your proficiency bonus. You're no longer raging, because this is more fear-struck at this point.
Travis: Oh, 14 plus five-- 19.
Matt: 19, yeah. You begin to ascend the chain. You get closer to it, and you can now see the axe itself is embedded and is starting to wiggle and pull out. So you're making your way up the chain with the full round at this point, you're almost to it, but that's going to be the rest of your action this turn.
Travis: Yeah, okay!
Matt: So what are you doing?
Liam: I'm taking the dragon sword and I am shoving it along the angle of the arrow that's coming in toward it, to try to go parallel.
Matt: Okay. The arrowhead is still poking through--
Liam: Through, and I'm sending it along that line.
Matt: Okay, okay. All right. Go ahead and make a general dexterity check. To see if you're able to--
Liam: Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: Okay. Using the essence of where the actual shaft of the arrow has pierced the hide and is stuck through, you take the blade and use your understanding of precision weapons and implements to find the slight opening. And the blade thankfully is very thin. Slide it through with minimal resistance. You can see the muscles are still pushing against it, but the already preset wound from the arrow does guide it through, and you manage to go straight to the hilt, and it's found its way all the way through the wound. No additional damage is dealt necessarily, but it has gone--
Liam: This does not count as an attack on the creature?
Matt: You said you wanted to put it through an existing hole.
Liam: The hole is this thick.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Like a straw, and the blade is this, that's not piercing damage? There's no piercing damage. Whatever you want.
Matt: Do you want to roll an attack for this?
Liam: Yes, I want it to be an attack.
Matt: Right, now you would make the attack as the blade. The idea being that you wanted to guide it through the hole.
Liam: I'm going to use one of my Lucks. I've got two left. Better.
Matt: Didn't you use any Luck for the battle?
Liam: I used one last time.
Matt: Right, so you have two left.
Liam: 12 plus strength, which is low, is 14. The dragon sword-- is the dragon sword plus anything, guys? I don't know that I have the--
Matt: Plus one.
Liam: Plus one. All right.
Matt: Yeah, and then it does additional damage against dragons.
Liam: Oh, and I have to roll-- I'll just say I missed. For my bonus action, I'm going to slide the dagger up along the same line and try to widen that gap.
Matt: Okay. This roll will be at disadvantage.
Liam: The last one was too, which is why I just scrubbed it.
Matt: Right, right, right. Go ahead and make the secondary attack.
Liam: No.
Matt: Yeah. Okay, so, the blade is in there and it has found its way through the existing wound, but you don't quite have the strength to actually wrench it enough to do any real, serious damage as it is a very, very hardy and well-defended creature from its natural mass. The fleshy interior of a dragon is almost as dense and as protected as the armored hide on the outside, and that's one thing you weren't counting on when entering its form.
Liam: And what did I just do, though, with the dragon sword, did I widen the hole?
Matt: You've put the blade through the hole and so now you have that blade lodged in, you can then use that to try and widen it in successive turns in itself and that will prevent you from having disadvantage on the attacks with that blade going forward, because it's already in a soft place and you can just wedge it, but it's going to be a strength attack for each of those rounds. The dagger unfortunately, you just can't find any purchase at that point there in the time given, because of the movement and the squishing. You do also suffer an additional seven points of crushing damage.
Liam: Okay, and I forgot. One other thing I want to do-- I have movement too, can I use my legs to push as hard as I can forward a foot or something? I know with movement over difficult terrain it's halved, and I'm in the most difficult terrain.
Matt: You are in the most difficult terrain there probably is.
Liam: But if I use my movement could I shove and go like a foot towards the outside, half a foot or anything?
Matt: Pushing towards the wound?
Liam: Pushing in. Using my legs to go--
Matt: Okay. I would say that would be part of your attack next round. Actual movement within, you would be able to move a few feet but you'd have to release the blade to do so. Any actual blade pushing forward would be your next action, so hold off for the next round. Scanlan, what you got?
Sam: Oi. So I'm in a beast. As we all know, intestines are my favoured terrain-- (laughter)
Travis: I remember him saying that years ago!
Matt: This is true!
Laura: Back when we first made these characters, I remember you saying that.
Sam: So I held up that rod, clicked it, and then it was pulled out of the body pretty close to where I am right now. When it went, did I see air? Did I see daylight, when it went out of there?
Matt: It was very small. It's the equivalent of a bullet going through, because the rod when it punched through it didn't-- it's a very thin, elongated object, so it pierced through like a metal rod at a very high speed.
Liam: So the dragon got very lucky and it went through like that, and not like that.
Matt: If it would have hit-- at whatever angle it would be, even then, it's only that wide and it would still puncture a tiny slit, and due to the density of both the muscles of the creature and its body, it took damage and there's a little bit of blood coming from the wound, you imagine, but it's not like it's going to leave an open, cavernous hole.
Sam: It's a cut.
Matt: Yeah, it's a cut.
Sam: Got it.
Matt: But you did see where it (tearing noise) through.
Sam: And when it went out, I didn't see any daylight or anything. Just disappeared.
Matt: You just saw it (tearing noise) through the creature's stomach. You do see a little bit of blood beginning to pour out of where the wound was.
Sam: Okay. Oh boy.
Travis: Do it, baby.
Sam: I don't know, I got nothing. All right, I'll just try something and we'll see if it works and then I'll try something else next time. I won't die in one round, right? I'm going to Polymorph into a Tri-- not-a-ceratops. Into a small, poisonous snake.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: And I'm going to go straight into that wound.
Matt: Okay, well, before that happens you do take four points of acid damage from the stomach before you take the form, because that would be the top of the round. So, at which point you turn into a small poisonous snake, now floating amongst the acids, and find your way along the surface. And you're heading towards the wound?
Sam: I'm going into the wound.
Matt: Okay, all right--
Sam: With a swim speed of 30!
Matt: Right, you do. (laughter)
Matt: Let me check.
Sam: But I don't know if it's swimming, it's more squeezing.
Matt: Through the acid, it's swimming. Once you get to the actual wound, this is more squeezing. And that's going to be more of a strength-based element. So that being the case here, a poisonous snake, I'm going to need you to go ahead and roll a strength check to push against the wound.
Sam: Sure, man. This is a strong snake.
Laura: Really?
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: Which, just as a heads up, is a minus four to its strength, so that's technically a negative three.
Sam: (bink) Going well, guys!
Matt: Yeah. You just dive in headfirst and with all your snaky might, you slither and slither and slither, just getting nowhere. No headway. This is bad. (laughter)
Liam: Why don't you bite it, dude?
Sam: Oh yeah! Sure, I'll take a bite.
Liam: Poisonous bite.
Matt: Sure, go for it. Roll for an attack.
Sam: 14 plus-- I have no idea.
Matt: Plus five.
Sam: Hey! That's a 19. That doesn't hit.
Matt: A 19? The inside of the stomach is not as well-armored as outer parts of the body. A 19 would hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Sam: What do I roll?
Matt: This would be-- oh no, you don't roll. It takes one piercing damage. (laughter)
Sam: Guys, we knocked it down a point!
Matt: And it has to make a constitution saving throw versus your poison. That's an eight plus 14, at a DC of ten. So yeah, it doesn't take any additional-- oh, it takes half damage. So go ahead and roll 2d4.
Sam: Ooh! Seven.
Matt: It takes three points of poison damage. (laughter)
Sam: And it is considered grappled. Okay. Plan A, cross it off the list. (laughter)
Matt: All right. Top of the round. Okay, so, Umbrasyl is still flying up, looking down at its form, is glancing about...
Travis: Don't see me! Don't see me!
Laura: You're in its butt. How can it see you?
Matt: Grog. As you're holding onto the axe, you see before you, just pass underneath the leg and the front arms that are reaching down, this giant, dark, looming projection comes down and looks right towards you. The horned front of the dragon as Umbrasyl stares right into your face and goes, "There you are." (draws in breath, exhales) And unleashes a torrent of acid towards you. I need you to go ahead and make-- this is going to roll a dexterity saving throw. You have disadvantage.
Travis: I do?
Matt: Because you're currently holding onto the chain, but I believe you have advantage on them because you are a barbarian.
Travis: I have Danger Sense. So just one roll?
Matt: Yeah. So just roll.
Travis: That's not great. 11.
Ashley: Can I-- do I see them?
Matt: No! They are way over-- they're like a tiny little dragon speck in the distance. We'll get to you guys here in just a moment, but their situation is a little more dire and immediate, so I have to figure out what's going on with them right now.
Laura: What if we could've chased after them? Right away?
Matt: You can if you want to. Did you want to go after them?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: I would have chased after them, immediately, when it took off.
Matt: Okay, we'll get to that in just a minute. As it is-- the dragon's speed is it can fly 80 feet per round.
Laura: That's really fast, though.
Matt: Yeah, and it's making double-dash manoeuvring here, even at your fly speed on the broom--
Laura: What do great eagles have? Giant eagles, I think, have really fast speed too.
Matt: Let's check that real fast. Giant eagles--
Marisha: 80.
Matt: 80 feet. So the eagles are able to keep up. Do you want something that way?
Laura: So, if the eagles were to pick up somebody--
Matt: First off, Grog, you take 62 points of acid damage.
Travis: Nice.
Laura: Wait, you have acid resis-- no, you don't, because Keyleth-- it went away.
Travis: It went away?
Laura: Yeah, remember? Because she used--
Matt: She took damage and it dropped.
Marisha: I took damage, I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault. I lost concentration. Blame the dragon that did 40 damage.
Matt: So, as the stream pours past you, you feel your flesh burning, and elements of your skin are actually sloughing off and plummeting beneath you like a thick oatmeal.
Laura: Gross!
Matt: You still maintain your grip on the axe through sheer force of anger and willpower. Umbrasyl slows down a little bit in not doing the double-dash maneuver. That's going to end Umbrasyl's turn. So you sent the eagles after--
Laura: Well no, I wanted the eagles to pick up Pike and Percy.
Matt: So the eagles swing by--
Marisha: Wait, not yet. Stone! Stone!
Taliesin: Throw her the teleport stone!
Ashley: Gatestone! I pull it out of my bag. Pass it to her.
Taliesin: I'm going to hop on an eagle.
Laura: I literally am sending the eagles as this is happening and I dash out of the tree on my broom, and go for the Immovable Rod, just long enough to stop and grab it and keep taking off after the dragon.
Matt: Okay, so you retrieve the rod, grab it, and head off in that direction. So we now have both of you, on eagle-back, heading off, with you trailing behind as you can't quite travel at the same speed as the eagles.
Taliesin: I'm going to try and clear my gun while I'm up there, too.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: You've got a ride. Animal handling. I'm going to drop and I'll start focusing on the Gatestone.
Taliesin: So, situated, I'm just going to try and clear the gun and see if it's an easy fix.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Nope. Gun's broken.
Laura: It's broken?
Taliesin: Yeah, gun's broken. I've got another gun, but big gun's broken.
Matt: Yeah, Bad News is out. All right. As you're flying off you're having a hard time with the bumpy ride, as this eagle also has been near death due to being partially dissolved by the acidic attack from the dragon before. It wasn't the acid, it was something else that wrecked it.
Laura: No, it was a bite or a claw.
Matt: Yeah, I think it was a bite or a claw, because the acid would've destroyed it. So the eagle's heavily wounded, and due to it shuddering and trying to keep up it just causes you to end up bending a portion of the actual weapon.
Taliesin: Damn it. I put it away.
Matt: All right. So you guys are keeping up. You're concentrating on the stone.
Marisha: One minute, baby.
Matt: Bringing us back now. Grog, you're recovering from this attack.
Travis: I look down and I see my beautiful body tattoos melting away like instant oatmeal. Not even like the nice apples and cinnamon kind, it's like the maple brown sugar that no one--
Laura: That's my favorite kind of oatmeal.
Travis: Nobody likes that; you're alone in this. And it makes me so angry that I go into a rage?
Matt: Do recall, you do have one point of exhaustion since your frenzied rage did wear off beforehand.
Travis: Right, yeah.
Matt: So you go into a rage.
Laura: Oh but we have Heroes' Feast, is that good?
Matt: It doesn't help with that, no.
Travis: All right. So I go in a rage, and I would like to try and continue climbing up the remainder of the distance to Umbrasyl.
Matt: Okay. Athletics check, with advantage.
Travis: That was a one.
Laura: Oh, that's way better!
Travis: That's much better. That's a 29.
Matt: You find your way up, grabbing onto the edge of the tail, and you actually pull yourself up onto the base of the tail. You're on the back of Umbrasyl right now. The chain is still currently attached to its side.
Marisha: Khaleesi!
Travis: Mother of dragons! Do I have any more movement?
Matt: It's taken your whole turn to really get up there. Are you going to dislodge the Bloodaxe, or leave it there?
Travis: I'm going to dislodge it, because it was already so weak.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and make your check to remove it. It's a DC 12, I think.
Travis: That's a one. Yep.
Matt: You pull on the chain, but the reason it managed to hold your weight this whole ride up was it was wedged pretty well into its armored hide. And thank god it did. However, at this point, it's proving that that is now coming back to haunt you, as it is really hard to pull it from where it's stuck in the dragon. That's going to be the end of your turn. Vax.
Liam: First turn I'm going to use the dragon blade to attack and slice downward and try to wedge that hole open a little bigger.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That hits. Well, I don't know if it hits. Nine plus my strength for this sword, right, not dexterity?
Matt: Correct. I'm letting this one be a finesse.
Liam: I probably hit him before. So that's a 25.
Matt: 25? You carve an opening in the side about a foot and a half in full length there. As you drag it you hear a roaring. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: It's 1d8 plus your dex--
Liam: Yeah, I know, I got that written down, thank you. 16.
Matt: 16? All righty.
Liam: And then, this is a game rules thing. Grog's within five feet of this thing and I'm no longer at disadvantage. Or am I?
Matt: This is less rules and more narrative. You don't understand the body or where you really are in the body of the dragon. He's not threatening the creature right now. If anything, it's potentially threatening you. This would not be a sneak attack.
Liam: I'm not arguing, I'm asking what's possible.
Matt: No worries.
Liam: I'll use the dagger to hit. Am I at disadvantage with the dagger still?
Matt: I'd say yes, because the only reason you didn't have disadvantage with the other blade is because it was within an existing wound and then you pulled back.
Liam: Then I miss.
Matt: Okay, the other dagger, you go ahead and stab again, this time it hits a dense part of muscle and does sink in, but not enough to do any serious damage from the inside.
Liam: And there's air queefing in and out of this slot? (laughter)
Matt: A little bit, yes. It's about that wide. You staying there?
Liam: Yes. No. I'm going to slide my body and try to stick head and dagger arm out of it and hang half in and half out, if possible.
Matt: Yeah. Go ahead and make a straight strength check.
Liam: 13.
Matt: 13? That's fine. Thankfully, the DC's lower because you managed to carve the large wound in. You plant your feet against the other muscle wall that you are between and you push off and get yourself through. And in the most awkward, tiny birth, just above your armpits, your head and arm emerge out the side. Immediately a gust of wind hits your hand as you realize and look down: you are hundreds of feet above the ground. Bramblewood right beneath you. But you are partially out of the dragon.
Laura: You can breathe!
Liam: (gasps for air)
Matt: Take a deep breath. You take three points of crushing damage as the muscle walls around you are still squeezing in on you in your current placement. That ends your turn. You! At the top of your round, your snake takes acid damage. Only one point of acid damage. How many hit points does your poisonous snake have?
Sam: I don't think he has very many.
Matt: It may have less than one hit point, in which case, you're just going to turn right back into Scanlan.
Sam: I think he's dead.
Matt: Let's find out. It has two hit points!
Sam: Oh god! Oh no, but wait, I took damage last round, too.
Matt: That was before you transformed. It was at the top of your round.
Sam: Hey, I'm still a snake! (laughter)
Sam: Well, I'm not going to try that any more. If I drop form, is that my whole round?
Matt: No, you just let it go.
Sam: I'm going to drop the snake. Snake was a try and fail.
Matt: It was a good idea. Just not a very strong snake.
Sam: I drop the snake, try to get that little bubble of air (gasps), and I'll fucking cast Bigby's Hand.
Matt: Okay! So, using that little pocket of air, you bring your hand up, you do your quick somatic components, shouting the phrase, and Bigby's Hand appears and is currently being squished between some of the walls of the stomach.
Sam: Can he move at all?
Matt: Yeah!
Sam: Okay. I would like to fist the wound. Jam it, find a finger and-- how you like that?
Taliesin: You're fingering the wound. Okay! (laughter)
Sam: This wound will never heal.
Matt: I don't-- yeah. (laughter)
Sam: So would it be a forceful hand?
Matt: This would be a very forceful hand. This would be the definition of Bigby's Forceful Hand. Go ahead and roll an athletics check for Bigby, which is strength 28, so add plus eight to the roll.
Sam: 12?!
Matt: Total of 12?
Sam: Yes!
Matt: The finger pushes partway in and gets about halfway up to its second knuckle. (laughter)
Matt: It is just chilling right there.
Sam: This is so embarrassing! Wow! (laughter)
Matt: I'm blushing, man!
Liam: All about phrasing.
Sam: Wow! Okay!
Matt: All right, that's your turn.
Sam: I have movement, right?
Matt: You do have movement, yes.
Sam: I can't move anywhere! I have climbing stuff with me. Can I move my arms at all?
Matt: You can move your arms, yeah.
Sam: I would like to take out a grappling hook and grab onto the inside lining of the stomach.
Matt: Okay, make a strength check.
Sam: Nope! Six!
Matt: Six. You take it and (ting, swish). It just slips along the very heavy mucous material lined interior of the stomach. There's a little scrape line, but that's about it.
Sam: I can't do anything! It's great.
Matt: Top of Umbrasyl's round. Breath weapon does not return. However, is going to use one of its legendary actions and attempt to beat its wings to shake you off of it, Grog.
Laura: Are you raging?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Which I have advantage on. 18.
Matt: 18. You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage, which is reduced by half, so you're only taking seven. However, you are knocked prone.
Travis: (laughing) On his back.
Matt: Yes, which causes you to begin tumbling off the back of the tail. The wind of it-- (thump thump)
Travis: Shit!
Matt: The chain of returning is still attached to you, however, and as you go tumbling off the back of the tail, it catches you, and you are now swinging towards the back of the creature, of the dragon now, back where you started. Only the dragon is very aware of your presence. But you didn't plummet to your death!
Travis: That's good!
Matt: That was the end of your turn. Now it's the top of Umbrasyl's turn.
Sam: These dragons are hard to kill!
Matt: Yeah, imagine that! At this point, now, as this has gone on for a little while as you guys began to ascend and it went upward, it's now partway up the mountainside. You can see the forest has gotten more sparse. There are trees scattered across the top of the mountaintop.
Liam: We're close to Gatshadow already?
Matt: You can see it. You're not there, but it's going across the forest top and it's coming towards the actual mountain base. It hasn't quite ascended it completely.
Laura: What about giant eagles with people on them?
Matt: They're keeping in tandem with it. They're not able to quite catch up entirely, just due to the nature of the fast dragon.
Liam: Arrow range?
Matt: Not for her, unfortunately, no.
Taliesin: We're not within 400 feet of it, are we?
Matt: You, at this point, jumping on, would just be on the outside of the range if you wanted to try. You're at disadvantage on these attacks because you are on the back of a flying, wounded bird.
Laura: Don't let the bird get hit by Umbrasyl!
Taliesin: Fuck it. Taking a shot. At least taking one shot to see what happens. Ooh yeah. Natural 20.
Matt: With disadvantage.
Travis: Do it again.
Taliesin: 18, that'll do. 27 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Oh, and he still has-- no, I lost Hex.
Matt: You lost Hex, yeah.
Liam: You're doing great, de Rolo, come on! Keep your head in the game.
Taliesin: 14 points of damage.
Matt: Gun goes off. You hear a whizz go by your ear as the bullet hits the side of Umbrasyl. (grunting) The head looks back towards the rest of you, now approaching at a distance.
Laura: Do not let the bird get hit! You will plummet to your fucking death.
Taliesin: I'm going to spend the rest of my attack pushing the eagle down to fly at tree level.
Matt: So, at the top of Umbrasyl's turn, as you guys are pushing forward and you're still concentrating, the dragon growls under its breath. (spellcasting) You can't hear it. You're too far away.
Ashley: She can read lips!
Laura: I'm so far away! I just want to know what he's saying.
Matt: The outer view of the dragon shimmers for a second and then vanishes from sight.
Liam: Are we visible?
Matt: No.
Liam: We're not like Wonder Woman inside the jet? What about my hand hanging out?
Matt: Yeah. You see the dragon.
Sam: What about Grog?
Matt: Grog is dangling from nothing right now. Grog is kiting through the air.
Taliesin: You have Hunter's Mark.
Ashley: So we can see Grog?
Matt: In theory, yeah, if you can keep a bead on him.
Travis: I'm enlarged.
Matt: A very heavy Grog.
Laura: Is he Hunter's Marked still--
Matt: He would be. You haven't taken a lot of damage yet, or at all.
Laura: I haven't taken any damage.
Matt: Then you still have Hunter's Mark on him, yeah. Continues upward. That comes to the next part. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I had one question. I drank that Potion of Speed. It hastes me for a minute. How many rounds is a minute?
Matt: That has gone away, unfortunately.
Travis: Well, there's nothing to do but to climb back up the chain!
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: Up the chain! Fucking weiner snap. 15.
Matt: 15? All righty. You manage to pull yourself halfway up the chain. You get back to where you were towards the base of the tail. That's the extent of your round there. The wind resistance itself, you can see the axe itself, after you tried to tug it forward, did bring it a little loose. So its position is still a little precarious.
Travis: Might as well say something cool. I can do this all day! I'm really not confident.
Matt: All right. Vax.
Liam: I would like to use my movement, if I can, with the blade I used to go this way, and I cut a big foot-long thing. I want to try to use my movement to reverse the direction of the blade and stab inward.
Matt: It would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack. It wouldn't use your movement. It would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack with it. It wouldn't use your movement.
Liam: My dagger hand's the one that's out. I want to try to maneuver the sword around and stab inward and keep cutting bacon in here. I want to attack the dragon, but still from the inside with the hand that's inside.
Matt: Okay. You're in a weird position now where the blade's at your side, so pulling away from the body, there's very little strength to pull that way, since you punched through the wound. So you're essentially holding the blade right here.
Liam: Then if I did this, can I just continue to saw in the same direction and do an attack?
Matt: You'd be at a disadvantage on it.
Liam: Visual. I don't know what I'm seeing.
Matt: T You stabbed through, you cut a wound. Holding that blade, you punched through, and the thickness is about most of your body's length. So most of your body is still in the wound. You've just barely pushed through, and you're still holding the blade back this way. There's no real strength to attack from this position because you're being squished.
Liam: Then I'm going to attack at disadvantage with the dragon blade, and then I'm going to stab with the dagger that's outside.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Dragon blade on the inside rolled a 15.
Matt: 15?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: There's just not enough strength to get it though. You try and pull upward and the blade comes loose, comes towards your body, but doesn't actually find any additional part of the muscle to cut through.
Liam: Dagger on the outside is 21.
Matt: 21? Just scrapes across the hide. Not strong enough to pierce it from the outside. You do also take one point of bludgeoning damage as the wound tenses around you once more. Scanlan!
Sam: For my bonus action, I'm going to fist the dragon again! Just going to jam it in there!
Matt: Roll an athletics check with plus eight.
Sam: 20!
Matt: 20! The hand pushes into the wound, causing it to tear open and rupture part of the stomach. As it punches through, temporarily leaving an open wound in the side of its stomach area, Bigby's Hand is partially outside the dragon now.
Sam: Great!
Matt: It takes 11 points of damage from the wound. And you currently have a little bit of light that's visible before the wound closes.
Sam: Before the wound closes.
Matt: The muscles re-tense. You watch it punch through and everything (gasp). It's the moment of impact.
Sam: I'm going to jump in the hole.
Matt: You leap in after Bigby's Hand just in the wake of it slamming into the side of the muscle of the stomach walls. In that one moment, you're rushing past, you can feel the actual muscles tensing behind you. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Dexterity saving throw. 18!
Matt: 18! Okay! You manage to leap behind Bigby's Hand and grab onto the side of it as the hand punches entirely out of the dragon's body, the wound slamming shut behind.
Sam: Oh god, I'm outside the dragon?!
Matt: You are now outside the dragon.
Sam: (screams) Shit!
Matt: Holding onto Bigby's Hand.
Sam: Is he flying? Does he stay still? What does he do?
Matt: He is flying.
Sam: He can fly?!
Matt: Bigby's Hand!
Sam: Not as fast as the dragon.
Matt: Bigby's Hand can move up to 60 feet, so no, it's slower than the dragon. Starting to drag a little bit behind as it's moving.
Sam: God. Okay! Hand can't do anything else, right?
Matt: No, that was its action. That's most of your turn, really, at this point. That was your movement to push through after the bonus attack, so you have your action. I'll give you your action.
Sam: You're not going to let me cast another spell, probably.
Matt: You have an action, so you could, technically. You look out as you punch through. You look down below you suddenly after you take a moment to look, and you can see part of Vax emerging from the side of the dragon. And then the whole dragon and Vax vanish.
Sam: Oh shit! Wait, I see Grog?
Matt: You do see Grog, dangling from the chain, slowly pulling his way up towards the back.
Travis: (screaming) Scanlan!
Sam: I'm holding onto the hand?
Travis: (screaming) What the fuck?!
Matt: You are now right there with Bigby's Hand. (laughter)
Sam: The Hand can't do anything else.
Matt: Not this turn, no.
Sam: Shit. I just got out of the dragon. I don't know what's going on. I didn't even know we were flying. I'm just going to shoot a Lightning Bolt at him.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Advantage on the dexterity saving throw. What's the DC of it? The DC of the Lightning Bolt?
Sam: It's my spell. It's not through the Hand Cone, I assume.
Matt: Nope, you are clutching both hands onto the side.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18. It makes the save. Roll damage, and it takes half damage.
Sam: 26.
Matt: 26. All right, so it takes 13 points of lightning damage. (blast) The bolt streaks upward, hitting the sides of the wound that you just came out of it, and arcs up the side of the body. Most of it is absorbed from the hefty, scaled hide of the black dragon, but it does (unhappy groan) roil with pain. You hear it yelling, and with a very slight shifting of light, you notice the dragon is still there, and you recognize this. This is an Invisibility spell. That ends your turn.
Sam: I guess so.
Matt: So, the rest of you guys, trying to keep up. The dragon's far out of range of anything you have, and it's just seems to be coasting as fast as it can out of the way, so you have nothing, I don't think, that can really go past a 300, 400 foot range. So you're just keeping on that eagle, holding on. You as well, you're behind the others, just slowly falling behind.
Laura: How fast can my broom go?
Matt: I think it's 50 feet. I can look it up again real fast. It's not a racing broom. Quidditch broom. I'll find it for you.
Laura: And my boots of haste don't do shit to a broom.
Matt: I'm going to look it up right now, just to let you know, so we can all relax.
Travis: It's the fastest model yet! I love Harry Potter.
Matt: I gather that. (laughter)
Matt: I love it, too. Broom of Flying. Flying speed is 50 feet. You can't even see it now. Grog's just become this little speck in the distance. All right, so as that's going on, are you doing anything?
Taliesin: I'm going to keep my eyes peeled on what I can see and try to keep up as best I can at treeline, like below.
Matt: Back to the top of the round. The dragon, Umbrasyl, now (wings flapping). Even you are being dragged behind nothing, you can hear the wings beating. You still have full sight of the dragon at this point. The voice growls out of its throat, "Fine. Let's see how well you hold on, insects!" It begins to spin and do a barrel roll. I need both of you, as also its muscles tense, to roll strength saving throws.
Travis: I have advantage on those.
Liam: Six.
Matt: Six?
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. You get swung around, the chain taking the brunt of all the weight across its back. (popping) Comes free. Thankfully, you were in an up arc, but you are now arcing in the air. You also get ejected from the wound from the muscles tensing behind, it almost squeezes you out. Before you can even get a grapple on, the dragon vanishes from sight and you're now falling backwards.
Liam: I'd like take a chance to say, here, that when I went into this dragon, I was lost, and a wanderer. As I am shat out its side, I come forth a paladin of the Raven Queen. I have multiclassed and leveled up. And the last thing I'm thinking as I shoot out this hole in its side is: if you have any wings to lend me, now is the time.
Matt: Okay. As you emerge from the body of Umbrasyl, there is a streak of shadow that scatters into a burst of darkened raven feathers that fill the air around you. You still plummet, but as a nature of your prayer, that brief moment of understanding, it appears there is some reaction. That'll be that element there.
Marisha: Where am I in my minute?
Matt: Oh, you're like 20 seconds in. 30 seconds in.
Ashley: Are they all falling?
Matt: You guys now watch as, suddenly, Grog and Vax just (rush of air). Vax appears out of nowhere and is falling. Scanlan's being held aloft by a distant Bigby's Hand, and Grog is arcing in the air. At that point now, Grog, Vax, what are you doing as you're falling backward?
Travis: I take out a case of fancy wine and-- (laughter)
Travis: I pull out a fancy robe, of which there are two, and pull it out. I'm going to drop the Bloodaxe. I'm going to grab both ends of the fancy robe and just make the shittiest parachute of all time.
Matt: (air puffs)
Travis: There ain't much else to do.
Marisha: Shitty G.I. Joes.
Matt: Yeah, it's like 25 cent quality, above you, Grog, as you squeeze your eyes and hold on. Plummeting down towards the Bramblewood. Vax.
Liam: Hey, I'm a brand new paladin. Lay on Hands, which is going to do fuck all for me, but is that a bonus action?
Matt: I believe it's an action.
Liam: An action? Okay. I'm going to cast Lay on Hands on myself. And I'm going throw my poison dagger at the dragon as I fall. That's a 23.
Matt: 23 does hit.
Liam: That is ten points of damage with poison on it. It's a DC of 15 for poison. I'm sure it makes it.
Matt: Yeah, it makes it. It would've had to roll a one to not make it, unfortunately.
Travis: Could I add one bonus thing at the end of mine?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Can I see Scanlan and Bigby's Hand at all? Or is the world just a clusterfuck?
Matt: Make a perception check, just glancing around you.
Travis: Four.
Matt: Four. No. You see earth beneath you, sky above, mountain to your left, and the inevitable plummet coming at you.
Liam: I'm thinking about my mother as I fall backward through space.
Sam: Distance between me and them?
Matt: Vax is about 20 feet from you, Grog's about 60, 70 feet from you.
Sam: What's the range of-- shit.
Taliesin: 50 feet.
Travis: Remember, we're going to be going the same direction.
Marisha: They're both falling, yeah. Vax will hit the ground first.
Sam: Vax will?
Travis: I'm higher.
Matt: The dragon's moved ahead to this point now since you guys have fallen off.
Sam: Is anyone higher than me?
Matt: Grog is. Vax is a little bit below you.
Sam: And he's not flying or anything, is he?
Matt: He's trying. He's holding a scrap piece of fabric that's just (rustling fabric).
Travis: I've seen Percy make shit, I can do it, too! (blows puffs of air)
Taliesin: You're doing very well. You're doing very well.
Sam: Wow. This didn't go well.
Marisha: I'm hoping you can hold on for a minute.
Sam: Okay. Yeah! I'm going to drop Bigby's-- 60 feet is not plummeting speed? I can't catch up to them as they fall?
Matt: Right now, you could catch up to one of them.
Sam: All right. Because Grog is over me, right?
Matt: Yeah, Grog is in an arc, so you would have to meet him as he fell.
Sam: I'll try to catch him then.
Matt: Okay, so you clutch onto Bigby's Hand and move as he plummets.
Sam: Shit, wait. Wait.
Matt: What are you doing? What are you doing, Scanlan?
Sam: Shit. Vax is below me, though.
Liam: He said you can get to one of them, so it's just a Sophie's Choice.
Sam: It's a Sophie's Choice.
Marisha: But who's on the lowest hit points?
Sam: Yeah, I would go for Grog if he's above me, with the hand.
Matt: Okay. The hand comes forward, sends out this cupping motion, the fingers below. You, eyes closed, clenching tight, (impact). All of a sudden, the wind stops, and it's like you're being held by your mother again, a memory you haven't recalled since you were a child. You open your eyes slowly, and you're still above the ground! Holy shit! But there's a giant purple hand around you and a very freaked out Scanlan clutching the outside.
Travis: Look what you did!
Sam: Hi, friend. Shit. We've got to go to Vax. I'll start moving us slowly down, I guess.
Matt: That was the turn to even get to him and catch him.
Sam: Then-- fuck.
Matt: You still have an action if you have anything.
Sam: I can't see the dragon anymore, right?
Matt: No. You have a vague idea of where it might be.
Marisha: Do you still have Polymorph?
Sam: Yeah, concentration.
Marisha: Fuck.
Sam: Yep. I mean, I can make Grog deaf so he won't hear us die. (laughter)
Matt: That's useful.
Taliesin: That seems like a really good use.
Sam: I got Grog. Fuck. Okay. I'm going to drop Bigby's Hand and Polymorph Grog into an eagle.
Matt: Okay. So, as you look over at Scanlan, with a big look of relief and thank you, he gives you a cursory look as the hand vanishes.
Travis: What. What?! (screams)
Sam: Holding on to him!
Matt: He grabs you real fast, and suddenly you have feathers! What the shit! And, strangely, you become smarter! As giant eagles have an intelligence of eight.
Liam: Quick, come up with a plan!
Travis: It's a new day, baby.
Sam: His brain is just geometry.
Matt: It's a Beautiful Mind moment in the middle of the sky. Suddenly you understand, the instinct hits you, and (whoosh). You have wings. You feel Scanlan's tiny hands grasping the back of your neck.
Sam: And I just yell at him, dive, motherfucker, dive!
Travis: (caw)
Matt: All right. You guys start seeing this happen in the distance and a little sparkle of hope hits you, whatever it may be. Coming back around to the top, Umbrasyl is taking a double dash motion. He's past.
Liam: He got away.
Matt: Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: Can I see that flurry of black feathers streaking downwards of this guy?
Matt: You do, and it is a perpetual flurry. They're coming out of nowhere. It is this long, visual line of black feathers that are being tossed from beneath Vax's flapping cape.
Travis: We're going full Point Break terminal velocity, straight down towards Vax.
Sam: I hope I can hold on! There's nothing to grab onto, is there?
Matt: There's just heavy feathers and digging in.
Sam: Luckily, I have a grappling hook. (dink dink dink)
Travis: Maybe in my dive position I could squeeze your legs with my wings, how about that?
Laura: You're really smart. You would think to do that.
Travis: I would.
Ashley: Yeah, you would.
Travis: I would also think, what idiot was just flying behind the back of this dragon on a chain? What a fool.
Matt: So as you go into a full dive, that's 80 speed, that's 160 feet. (whoosh) You manage to just crest underneath the plummeting Vax, the trail of black feathers, trailed by a long line of brown feathers being plucked out from Scanlan, feverishly trying to grab onto your back for some sort of purchase. Pain. You deal with pain all the time. It doesn't dissolve your focus. Vax, I need you to go ahead and attempt to grab onto the eagle as it swoops beneath you. Go ahead and make a single strength saving throw.
Liam: No, wait, Luck! I have one last Luck.
Matt: This is the time to use it.
Laura: Oh my god!
Liam: 21.
Matt: As the eagle swoops underneath you, you reach out. You don't even see it, you're looking up into the sky as you plummet, the trail of feathers going past as you concentrate on the acceptance you've made to the Raven Queen, and the understanding that perhaps, if there is a chance to survive, let it be through this leap of faith you've taken in the direction of an entity that you've been so fearful of and scoffed at since she came to you in your dreams. A moment, you see the feathers begin to trail off and subside from beneath your cloak, and a voice whispers in your ear and says, "Left." Without thinking, your hand reaches out, without even seeing, and you (impact) grab the edge of Scanlan's cloak.
Sam: Oh no!
Matt: As you're dragged behind, you (choking) from behind.
Sam: It's worth it, it's worth it!
Matt: You can barely breathe as the eagle swoops up, you can feel the heartbeat, the blood flowing in the back of your head, your ears hot (heartbeat) as you slowly reach over and grab the back of the eagle. Is this Keyleth? You don't know. All you know is Scanlan swooped in and in this moment of need, seemingly, a prayer was answered. So what are you guys doing?
Laura: And you're itty bitty still!
Liam: I prefer raven-sized.
Matt: Yeah, he's tiny. That's the only reason I'm not having him tear you off the back of the eagle, because of the size.
Travis: Unless I hear otherwise, I'm making a controlled descent towards the ground.
Matt: Okay. You guys see this in the distance as now the eagle captures the falling Vax and then begins to head down towards the base of the mountain where the Bramblewood meets.
Laura: I guess we head down that direction.
Ashley: Yeah. Make the eagle follow.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way downward towards the bottom. Keyleth, you finish your concentration on the stone. (whoosh) Suddenly, you step through, being pushed through a tunnel of blue light and energy, and for a moment, all you see before you is Vax's face, his tiny little raven-sized face.
Marisha: So cute!
Matt: (whoosh) As you guys watch Keyleth apparate right in front of Vax, and go speeding past you, as she's now plummeting from the air, having summoned to your side.
Marisha: I'm technically an earth elemental still.
Matt: You're still earth elemental? So yeah, you see Keyleth as a giant boulder that appears at the side. You have to dodge out of the way (whoosh) as this giant rock being, out of the corner of your eye, appears before you. However, she sinks straight past you. You're flying as low as you can, you're going terminal velocity, and there is this (rumble) rock entity plummeting at the same rate.
Taliesin: A meteor.
Marisha: You know, it was a good idea when he was still in the dragon.
Matt: Yeah, I know. It was.
Liam: (singing) I came in like a wrecking ball!
Matt: At about 200 feet up, you continue to plummet.
Marisha: 200 feet? That's all right.
Matt: All right. You're not doing anything else? You're going to take the fall?
Marisha: Well, what's below me?
Matt: The very edge of the Bramblewood and the base of the mountain. You're not quite sure where you'll land. You see treetops and rocks.
Taliesin: What's the worst that's going to happen?
Marisha: I would hit zero hit points as an earth elemental and go back to Keyleth.
Matt: And then the rest of the damage would carry over.
Marisha: Right, but 200 feet. That's survivable.
Matt: That's 20d6.
Sam: You'll be fine. What's that? 60 points.
Marisha: Yeah. It's roughly 60 points, and I've got 67 left as this earth elemental.
Matt: All right, so you're going to take it?
Marisha: Hang on, wait. Wait, wait. If I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it right. I'm going to ball up like a cannonball and light up my hands, that I keep forgetting because I didn't know I could do them in elemental form, by the way. Thought it was only beast form. I'm going to light myself on fire and go meteor.
Matt: All right. You guys watch as the earth elemental curls up, forms this streak of flame and smoke behind, and now a plummeting Keyleth meteor goes slamming into the base of the mountain just past you as you pull up from impacting at terminal velocity.
Marisha: I was trying to leave an impression. No pun intended.
Matt: You suffer 76 points of bludgeoning damage upon impact.
Sam: Of Jor-El damage. (laughter)
Matt: (boom) This giant crater is left around your form as now there is this somewhat smoke-swirled Keyleth sprawled out in the center of this.
Marisha: I drop, and I stand up, Keyleth, in the middle of a giant crater.
Matt: The rest of you all eventually catch up. The eagle-back carriers, you on broomback, finding your party bruised, hurt, but ultimately survived this moment of the encounter. As you've all had this moment to yourself, Vex, you hear a noise to your left coming from the exterior of the Bramblewood.
Laura: Can I see what it is?
Matt: You glance off to the side, and you can see, emerging, slowly from the forest, a single humanoid standing before you.
Sam: Is he single?
Matt: No. You see, slowly coming forward, a woman. An older woman, an older goliath woman, missing one eye and missing her forearm-- her left arm, right at the elbow. The right arm clutches a very tall quarterstaff that is being used as a walking stick as she wanders up. You can see dirt smeared in her face, darker dreadlocks pulled tight against the back of the head that dangle past the shoulders, tattoos similar to the ones that adorn Grog across the face and shoulders. She slowly walks towards the party. Let's go ahead and bring our guest for the evening out. You can go around the other way. Let's welcome Chris Perkins!
Liam: Welcome, Chris, welcome!
Taliesin: Is he coming to this side?
Matt: Right to the edge, next to you, Keyleth.
Sam: Do you know how to play this game?
Chris perkins: Keyleth meteor, what?
Marisha: Yeah, that's me.
Matt: As she steps up and emerges from the forest, everyone turns and sees the worry on Vex's face.
Laura: (laughs) Vax pours a drink.
Liam: It was very frightening.
Laura: Halt! Who are you?
Chris perkins: My name is Shale.
Laura: What's your business here?
Chris perkins: I was following a scouting party out to the mountain. But these old bones don't take me as far as fast as they used to.
Travis: Do I recognize Shale?
Matt: You do, actually. Not very well. Shale has been around longer than you have as part of the herd, but is mostly considered past her prime as a warrior. Since she lost her arm, was set to the side, and a lot of the herd seems to not value their elders when they become less powerful in battle, but even still, she carries a bit of spit and vinegar to her. But it's been a while since you've seen her, and to see her surviving out here, both curious and honorable.
Travis: Shale.
Sam: Sorry. You're still an eagle.
Matt: (caw)
Travis: (caw)
Sam: Grog, do you want to say something?
Chris perkins: I will brandish my quarterstaff, my rune-covered quarterstaff, and try to hold this big creature at bay.
Matt: Shale's holding her staff out.
Chris perkins: Stand down, bird!
Liam: I love you! Let me love you!
Sam: All right, all right. I'll drop the form. I'll drop the form.
Travis: Thank you, god. Shale.
Chris perkins: Grog? Is that you?
Travis: Yeah, it's me. I know, you can't tell.
Chris perkins: You're kind of a blur. What's on your face?
Travis: It's a beard.
Chris perkins: You've gotten big.
Travis: Yeah. Lots of lifting. Lots of running, getting strong.
Chris perkins: Last time I saw you, you were the runt of the goatball team.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: You were a runt, Grog?
Travis: No, when I was born, she means. When I was born.
Laura: Was he rather small?
Chris perkins: He was puny.
Travis: Puny compared to mountains and stuff.
Ashley: What's goatball?
Chris perkins: It's a game you play. You stand on pillars of rock, and you hurl balls at each other.
Laura: Made of goats?
Chris perkins: Made of goatskins. Skins, my dear.
Marisha: Sounds kind of fun.
Chris perkins: The object of the game is to knock the other opponents off their pillars.
Liam: That's more civilized than what we were imagining.
Travis: It's a lot of fun, actually.
Laura: Shale, what were you doing out here with a scouting party? It seems--
Chris perkins: We were spying on the dragon. Damnable beast.
Laura: Did you succeed?
Chris perkins: No. The scouting team did not fare well.
Marisha: Are any of them still alive?
Chris perkins: No. They're all dead.
Sam: How did you survive?
Chris perkins: I was slow and stupid. I shouldn't have gone at all. I couldn't keep up with them. By the time I got to them, they were corpses.
Sam: You sound like an excellent addition to our team, then.
Chris perkins: She says, I would have killed the dragon as soon as it came upon us, when we first arrived in Westruun, but that damn Kevdak formed an alliance with the beast.
Laura: Wait, you think you can kill a dragon?
Ashley: Wait, what did you just say? Oh.
Sam: We knew that.
Ashley: Yes. Realized it as I was saying it.
Chris perkins: That is how I wanted to die. Fighting the dragon.
Marisha: It's funny, we almost just died fighting the dragon. How ironic.
Travis: We put a good hurting on it, yeah. Do you-- I mean, not like I'm questioning what can you do, because I don't think it's very much.
Marisha: I'm actually great. I'm just in a smoldering meteor and look like a badass.
Matt: Which caught your attention, the large, crashing boom.
Chris perkins: That was it.
Liam: I yank on Vex's hand from down below and say, pick me up! Put me on your shoulder!
Laura: What's the matter? Can you not see anything down there? I pop Trinket out and put Vax on top of him. Don't you feel so tall now?
Liam: I am tall.
Marisha: How much longer is he going to be tiny?
Matt: How long does the potion last?
Liam: I rolled a three, so that's three hours.
Matt: Yeah, three hours.
Travis: Sweet.
Liam: We have to decide what to do. He's gone back to his hole. He's going to rest. He's going to heal.
Marisha: I just have such a hard time taking you seriously right now. I'm so sorry.
Travis: So you had to have been a part of this party for a reason. What's in your bag of tricks? What can you do?
Chris perkins: I smash things with my stick.
Travis: With your stick. Does magic come out of your stick?
Chris perkins: It is a magical staff.
Travis: Oh, well, that's good.
Sam: Yeah, we could use more of those.
Travis: Is it a magical staff of dragon killing?
Chris perkins: It will be if we get on with it.
Travis: I like that.
Liam: I like her, too.
Marisha: So, Shale, did you and your scouting party find out any additional information that might be handy?
Laura: Maybe how to get into the lair without it knowing?
Marisha: What she said.
Chris perkins: I know nothing of use.
Laura: That's wonderful.
Liam: You never made it up to the cave entrance, did you?
Chris perkins: I made it up to the dead ones. That's as far as I got.
Laura: How far were the dead ones?
Chris perkins: A ways.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: I hate to tell you this, but Kevdak is gone.
Chris perkins: No great loss.
Sam: Your whole herd may have perished fighting this same dragon.
Liam: Not all of them.
Marisha: A lot of them.
Travis: But it will all be worth it if we can remove the head of this shitty black dragon.
Chris perkins: I agree.
Laura: Plus, Zanror is still alive, as is his wife. I think.
Sam: Maybe.
Marisha: We hope.
Taliesin: Possibly.
Travis: So, how far would you think that we are from his lair?
Chris perkins: I'll just crane my neck up the mountain.
Matt: It's a sizable climb. Gatshadow-- While this portion is the south part of the Cliffkeep Mountains, which get higher the further north you go, this mountain is called Gatshadow because it is dark and ominous and stands out amongst the rest of the mountains. While the other ones crest at about maybe 4,000 feet up, this one's nearly a mile, a little over a mile high.
Laura: Well, we can obviously fly.
Matt: There are sparse trees, most of them dead or dried out towards the top, but other than that the vegetation is pretty sparse.
Travis: Look, I'm a little jacked up. I think those two are a little jacked up.
Marisha: I could use a short rest.
Travis: It's fair to assume that he will do the same thing, yeah?
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Go brush his teeth, have a deuce, all that stuff.
Marisha: We're trying to catch the dragon while he's still debilitated, right?
Liam: The longer we wait, the harder it will be.
Ashley: What if I just heal everybody and we keep on?
Sam: Yeah, that's great.
Ashley: I don't want to lose the damage that's on him.
Sam: Yeah, heal us and let's keep going. Quickly. How long has it been, a minute? Two minutes?
Matt: Since you guys landed here? It's probably been about two, three minutes.
Sam: We've got to move.
Travis: Can we travel a mile up a mountain quickly?
Sam: We have eagles.
Matt: Even at your fastest pace, eagle speed...
Liam: The broom and the two eagles at this point?
Matt: The broom is slower than the eagles. Eagle speed you're looking at about-- I'm estimating somewhere between ten to 20 minutes.
Liam: That's enough for a short rest for it. He's not going to go back to full strength, but he's going to go back up a bit.
Laura: Would we know that?
Marisha: We don't know what he has access to.
Matt: You would know, being as dragons are your favored enemy, and you have information on that. Generally, they don't-- They themselves can recover over time, and if given a full day or so, they can largely recover from the wounds they have sustained almost entirely, especially a dragon as powerful as an ancient. You would know that, because they understand and fear their demise, or at least are arrogant enough to think it's not possible, they will have certain reserves to try and help them recover if they ever find themselves in a dire circumstance. Occasionally, depending on the intelligence of the dragon and what resources it has at its disposal.
Marisha: Reserves. What do you mean?
Laura: Healing stuff?
Matt: Some semblance of healing magic, items they may have acquired that can help. The longer you wait, the more it can recover, is essentially what it comes down to.
Liam: We need to go now. We need to go.
Sam: Should we mist form it there? Can we do that?
Laura: That takes too long to think about.
Marisha: I can get us there via trees.
Sam: But you'd need to know a tree that's there.
Marisha: I need to know a tree that's there. I could Scry, look for the closest tree, teleport us there, but by the time I'm getting there, I'm exhausted.
Liam: Are you able to see a tree from a great distance?
Marisha: If I Scry.
Liam: Not even by eyesight?
Marisha: I mean, I guess I can look around and take a guess.
Ashley: I'm going to cast Mass Cure Wounds on everybody.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and do that. And Shale, you feel nice and warm at full health as the Mass Cure Wounds tickles you.
Laura: Is your arm back?
Matt: Unfortunately, no. If only!
Sam: The temporary hit points never go back up, right?
Matt: Correct, no. They were just for that little bit of damage.
Chris perkins: Lost it in an avalanche, I did.
Sam: Today?
Chris perkins: No, turd.
Matt: The Scrying will take you about ten minutes or so.
Laura: Are we going to Scry it or are we just going to go? How long would it take if we just flew up? 20 minutes?
Matt: That's if you were all on eagle-back. Which you don't. You have eight people, and you currently have two summoned eagles.
Liam: Speed of the slowest.
Matt: Yeah, the speed of the slowest here, you're looking at walking up the mountain.
Marisha: Yeah. So I can teleport us closer and then walk, or we can take a very short rest so I can get my beast shaping back, and then could fly a few more of us. It's a gamble.
Chris perkins: You take your rest, love. I'll start up the mountain.
Matt: Shale walks away and starts hiking up the rocks at the very base of Gatshadow.
Travis: Can I just say that we agree that the reason we didn't do what Zanror wanted and go to the lair is because it's a fucking death trap?
Sam: Yes, but the dragon is injured now.
Travis: But he's going to heal up by the time we get there.
Sam: Not all the way.
Travis: Pretty good.
Liam: It's still the best chance we have. We have to kill it now.
Travis: In its lair?
Chris perkins: It's your destiny to fight the dragon, Grog.
Marisha: Wait, what? What was that, Shale? Is that true?
Chris perkins: No, it's not true. (laughter)
Ashley: Everybody is healed 27.
Chris perkins: It's just a thing old women say.
Marisha: Just let him believe it.
Liam: Kiki, may I have my-- Sorry. (higher voice) May I have my cloak back?
Marisha: Oh, yeah, sure.
Liam: Thank you. (flump, whoosh)
Matt: To attune to it will take you a short rest.
Marisha: So are we resting?
Matt: That's up to you guys.
Liam: I don't know. But I'm still putting it on.
Travis: When I turned into the eagle, what happened to the Bloodaxe and chain?
Matt: Actually, you check, and the equipment that you have attuned to you and attached go into the form with you, so at this moment you realize, "Oh, the axe!" You look behind you, and it's just been dragging behind you in the dirt, carving this path in the rocks and rubble.
Travis: Yeah. That's nifty.
Matt: Like a kid with a deflated balloon you're just dragging behind you.
Laura: Can I-- well, I can't sense anything about it with Hunter's Mark, I just know where he is.
Matt: You know where it is.
Laura: And he's up in his lair.
Matt: He is up at the top of Gatshadow, somewhere in that mountain.
Laura: Moving around, or is he chilling?
Matt: At the moment, seems chilling.
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: Short rest or not, what are you guys doing?
Marisha: How long would the hike up the mountain be? An hour?
Matt: It's about a mile up. You're looking at the better part of a day.
Sam: Oh, a mile up.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Unless we fly.
Taliesin: What if we take shifts with the eagles?
Matt: Take shifts with the eagles? Back and forth?
Taliesin: Eagles fly a group up, fly down, pick up another group and bring them?
Matt: Probably about an hour.
Taliesin: But that's an hour with a short rest for everybody as well.
Matt: If you're going to do it that way, yeah.
Liam: Half could rest at the top while the eagles fly back, and the ones at the bottom could rest.
Taliesin: So there's a short rest.
Liam: Shifts of resting, yeah.
Matt: You're still looking at about an hour and a half at that point, with people moving there and back and getting enough rest. You can't short rest on the trip, and the short rest is about an hour, half an hour.
Liam: Eagles drop off, they rest while the eagles return, and the people at the bottom rest while the eagles are making the trip, no?
Matt: Right, but you still have to have the eagles that went to the bottom to pick up the second team to get there, so you're still looking at about an hour and a half to two hours.
Laura: I could also use another spell and summon a couple more eagles.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: I could summon two more eagles.
Liam: That's worth it.
Laura: And that could get how many of us up?
Liam: All of us up at the same time.
Sam: But one is just for Grog, right?
Laura: But two more eagles would get all of us up?
Matt: It's a concentration spell. You can only have one of it up at a time.
Laura: It is?
Matt: Yeah. And it only lasts for an hour, and you've already been at this for probably about ten, 15 minutes.
Laura: So they're about to go away.
Matt: You have about another 40 minutes of the eagles.
Marisha: So we couldn't do round trips anyway. They'd dissipate.
Matt: You'd just have to recast it.
Marisha: Well, yeah.
Sam: That seems like our fastest option. What's the other option? A short rest and then we bamf.
Marisha: We rest and then go. If we rest for 30 minutes, and then I switch and then we have the eagles, then we can get up in another 30 minutes, and then it's an hour. Theoretically, short resting is our shortest.
Matt: You said you have Transport Via Plants, right?
Marisha: I do.
Matt: If you wanted to Scry up that mountain and look at one of the trees at the top, you could do that. That would be, technically, the fastest way.
Marisha: But then we'd still have to hike. How long would the hike be?
Matt: It depends on how close the nearest tree to the cavern would be.
Sam: Let's do that.
Marisha: I'm tapping myself-- I can do it, but I'm tapping myself out. I'm burning literally all my top level spells and I have no beast shapes left. But I can do it. It's what we think is most important.
Laura: What if we use the eagles, send them up. Once they're used up, they're gone at the top, and then I'll just summon two more and send everybody else up? Once the people make it up the top, that way it takes less time. A couple people hop on the eagles right now, because we only have a little bit of time left.
Marisha: Can I rest? Can I rest while the first round goes?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: We're fighting a dragon in its lair! In the worst place we could possibly fight it!
Sam: We've also dealt so much damage to it.
Matt: Umbrasyl was looking pretty rough.
Sam: I fisted through it!
Taliesin: He said looking pretty rough.
Travis: That's because he's a liar and a bringer of death, and he is smiling at you while he does it.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: What are we going to do today with Chris Perkins? Talk, or go fucking kill a dragon?
Taliesin: Would you like a tour of Whitestone? It's really lovely this time of year.
Chris perkins: I'm judging you!
Liam: Grog, she's right. It is your destiny.
Travis: In your tiny voice.
Liam: What are you laughing at?
Laura: Everybody hop on an eagle.
Ashley: I hop on an eagle.
Taliesin: Hopping on an eagle.
Sam: Well, no, half of the people hop on an eagle.
Laura: Two of the halflings-- two of the gnomes can get on.
Ashley: Scanlan.
Sam: I'm in back?
Ashley: Yes.
Liam: I'm sort of a halfling. Can I get on too?
Matt: At your size? The three of you would probably be able to take one eagle, because you are tiny.
Sam: Oh, that's right, he's a little one.
Laura: All right. You guys go.
Liam: See you in a bit, sis! Bye, Keek!
Matt: So we'll say, for the purposes of this, it'll take an additional cast of your spell, so mark off a second casting of Conjure Woodland Beings. However, that brings-- What level is that?
Laura: That is level-- Oh, good. Level three.
Matt: Conjure Woodland Beings?
Laura: So I've got two level threes left. With my Pearl of power.
Matt: Conjure Woodland Beings is a 4th-level spell, Laura.
Laura: I have Conjure Animals, not Woodland Beings.
Matt: Animals, there we go. Sorry, so yeah, that is 3rd-level. So yeah, mark off your second casting there. You guys manage to make a short rest between the journeys, making your way up towards the dark, blackened rock peak of Gatshadow. We're going to take a short break here for restroom. We'll be back here in a few minutes. In the meantime we have an awesome video from Backblaze to show you guys--
Ashley: Yay!
Taliesin: It's really cute.
Marisha: It's for you guys!
Matt: We'll be back here in a few minutes guys, stay tuned for apparently the attack on Umbrasyl's lair. See you in a minute. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. We've had a little break here. A quick announcement for you guys, the rebroadcast tonight will be delayed for about 30 minutes as we have to shoot something directly after this so we can all go home. So, if you guys are in chat after and folks are showing up going, "Where's the rebroadcast?" Just let them know it'll be around, about a 20-30 minute break between. We appreciate you guys carrying that thread over to them when they arrive. So we've had a break. If you wanted to use any of your hit dice to heal up during the short rest, now's the time to do it. You've re-attuned to the Dragon Slayer Longsword. And just so you guys know, both Grog and Vax leveled up to 14 as well. Vax took a level of paladin during the short rest. Grog also took his 14th level as a barbarian. As a berserker, a lot of you know what that means.
Sam: I don't know what that means.
Liam: We'll find out. I'd like to re-attune to the Cloak of Displacement. And the Boots of Haste, are they spent for the day for anybody? If I were to wear them, could I get the juice or no? They're done?
Laura: They're too big for you, teeny.
Liam: They would shrink to me. I'm going to re-attune my Keen Dagger, then, for the moment. So it's Deathwalkers Ward, Keen Dagger, Cloak. Three items.
Matt: Okay. I'll let it happen. Usually, you attune one item in a short rest.
Liam: Oh, okay. No, I can do one.
Matt: I think it's fine for this. You get attuned as you walk up the rest of the way. It's fine.
Travis: I've rolled all nine of my hit dice.
Matt: So you're out of hit dice?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right. Everyone else good? Ready to jump back in?
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: (laughs)
Sam: Does anyone need more healing? Are we okay?
Marisha: Yeah, we're good.
Laura: And because I Conjured Woodland Animals, I lost my Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Yes, you did, but you know loosely where it was.
Sam: All right, let's hurry.
Matt: As you guys slowly make your way up towards the peak of Gatshadow, you all come to rest maybe, from what best you can tell, is the entrance cavern that Umbrasyl currently calls its home. Across this blackened, dark craggy surface, you see clumps of dead, petrified trees. Leafless, gnarled, and devoid of any life. There are signs of melted stone, soot. Long ago, there may have been a fire that claimed the top of this mountain and set its visual presentation that got its name. However, this is your moment, should you wish to make your way towards your conflict with Umbrasyl. How do you wish to prepare?
Laura: I want to sleep for a day.
Marisha: Yeah. I want to rock back and forth in a corner.
Liam: I'd like to go stealth and I'd like to see-- is there one clear, main entrance to this place?
Matt: There is a cavern opening.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: There are a few small little inlets into the mountain at certain points, but the path that you guys land on that ends? You're going to have to climb around the mountain to get to the entrance of this. There is no walk-up path. Actually, just an opening on the side of the mountain.
Liam: So we're further down still. We're not near the entrance?
Matt: You're about 400 to 500 feet away from the entrance.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: You stealth ahead and look a little bit and you notice the path comes to an end. You probably have about a hundred feet that you have to scale the side of mountain to get to the entrance.
Liam: From where I am, I can tell that we need to climb around it. If I look very hard, do I see any little holes or cracks or anything above?
Matt: You see one other small entrance about maybe 60 feet below it, a little bit to the left.
Liam: All right.
Sam: Pretty cool sound effects
Chris perkins: It's freaking me out.
Laura: Is that your music?
Matt: That is not my music. That's the atmosphere.
Taliesin: Shale, Shale. The scouting party. Where did you find the bodies? Where were they left?
Matt: Which actually you-- this was probably a couple hundred feet back. They made it near the peak. However, they were spotted upon the approach, and you heard the battle. The very short battle that ensued. Heard the screams of them, far from your eyesight.
Chris perkins: I will have pointed them out, then.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: So that's why I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Liam: How far above our position is that smaller entrance-- (noise of hissing gas)
Matt: It's all atmosphere, guys. I paid them to do it. I know. All right. Towards where the actual walkable portion of this mountain cliff ends, you have about 40 feet of scaleable wall, at an upward angle, before you can reach that small little inlet that you saw there. An additional 60 feet beyond that is the larger entrance where you saw, the best you can tell, Umbrasyl retreat towards-- or exit before, when you were watching him emerge from the mountain. That's it.
Liam: What do you think? Do you think I should climb in that little hole?
Laura: Do you want-- say that again?
Liam: There's a main entrance above. But there's also a smaller, little gap lower down. He cannot fit in there.
Marisha: I can try and scry inside the cavern.
Laura: See if it's something that would be worth--
Marisha: Get a battle perspective?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: All right. You have to give me a few minutes. Is everyone all right with that?
Laura: Can I use my ranger skills to try to camouflage us into the side of the mountain? To make us even more non-seeable?
Matt: Yeah. Totally. So we'll say for the purposes of that, anyone at this point who'd like to make a stealth check, to go ahead and keep yourselves hidden from any onlooking parties.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Laura: Add ten.
Liam: Natural 20!
Marisha: Hey!
Matt: Add ten for Pass Without a Trace.
Sam: 17.
Taliesin: 24.
Chris perkins: 22.
Travis: 16.
Ashley: 29.
All: Whoa!
Ashley: What?! (laughter)
Liam: Why, I do declare.
Ashley: Well, I do declare I'm invisible.
Matt: The armored cleric cannot be seen. (laughter)
Laura: 32.
Matt: With Vex's help, you guys manage to take bits of the mud, soot, and the burnt remnants of the once lush forest that dotted this mountainside, and darken your exteriors to help obscure the vision of anything that wished to pry, along with the magic drawing the shadows to your forms. You're pretty confident that most of you would be fairly difficult to be spotted by most creatures.
Liam: I would just like to point out that my complete total is 45.
Ashley: Of stealthing?
Laura: Thank you. Thank you for pointing that out.
Liam: Yes. It's mostly for your benefit.
Laura: I appreciate it.
Matt: That's ridiculous.
Ashley: How?
Laura: How?
Liam: Natural 20, plus my 15 benefit, plus Pass Without a Trace. Poof! (vanishing sound)
Matt: You've stealthed through time. People who had seen you previously in your past, have no recollection of ever actually seeing you. (laughter)
Liam: Marty McFly's holding a photograph.
Matt: Exactly. All right. So, what's up now?
Marisha: I take a little of the soot, and I give myself some druid battle make-up.
Matt: There you go, just smear it.
Laura: Yeah. Did you scry yet?
Marisha: I'm about to.
Laura: Okay. I do the same thing. I soot my face up, too. Let's all make battle paint while she's scrying.
Taliesin: Absolutely not. (laughter)
Marisha: Pretentious asshole.
Ashley: I want to do a hand. (laughter)
Laura: I get soot on my finger and walk up to Percy and just put a line from his forehead down his face.
Taliesin: I feel violated, but thank you.
Chris perkins: I'll ask Grog if he wants any soot on his face. I'll walk over.
Travis: I'll put soot on your face if you come near me with that wicked, wicked staff of yours.
Chris perkins: This is not wicked. It's just a staff. It doesn't even have a name.
Travis: What?! How could you have a staff and not give it a name?
Chris perkins: Only men name their things. (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah. My staff doesn't have a name. It's so true.
Chris perkins: You know, if you kill this dragon, you'll be the greatest goliath that's ever lived.
Travis: No.
Chris perkins: Yes!
Travis: Really?
Chris perkins: No one else has killed a dragon of this size. Not among us. Not among the Herd.
Ashley: Grog.
Travis: Pike killed a dragon.
Chris perkins: Did you, now?
Ashley: Well, we all did. But it wasn't this big.
Laura: It was pretty small.
Ashley: It was pretty-- it was a lot bigger than me.
Chris perkins: I'm sure that experience will come in handy.
Sam: All right, let's do this.
Marisha: All right. I scry. I focus really hard on the dragon.
Matt: Okay. On Umbrasyl?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Do you need any of his stomach bile to help you scry?
Marisha: Sure! Can I have some of the-- I scrape a little stomach bile--
Sam: Does that help? Does that help?
Matt: Well, here. Let me pull up the actual specifics for Scrying here.
Chris perkins: This is going to go well, I can feel it.
Marisha: Wait. He's going to sense what I can scry, can't he? Maybe I can just try and scry inside the lair?
Matt: It largely depends.
Sam: What do you want to do?
Marisha: I mean, he knows we're coming, yeah?
Laura: Can you scry that little cavern to see where it leads to? Can you scry your mind up the cavern?
Marisha: Yeah. Actually, can I do that? Like it's a camera drone?
Matt: It's more like picking a location, as opposed to an actual--
Marisha: Sure. I want to try and focus on Umbrasyl's whereabouts, but I want to see if I can get a nice bird's-eye view of inside the cavern.
Matt: Okay. You are familiar with the target as you've done battles, that does adjust the saving throw for the scry. So, without further ado, what's the DC of your spells currently?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19. Hmm. As your eyes close, your vision projects itself beyond your form, beyond the craggy landscape of Gatshadow, out beyond the mountain pass that ends abruptly. Beyond the cavern entrance, you are pulled within the darkness. Suddenly, you find a little bit of light scatters across the damp stonework of the inside of this cavern. You see stalagmites. You see pools of murky, greenish-brackish liquid, ever so gently disturbed by the wind that curls in and out of this cavern. You see towards the back an elevated platform next to another pool, where a large outcropping of stone that has just slowly pulled itself out of the rock, nearly touching the very height of this cavern. You don't see anything in there. All you hear is (low breathing sound).
Sam: He's asleep.
Chris perkins: (loudly) What do you see?
Marisha: Ah! (laughter)
Marisha: Well, nothing now. That's it? That's all I see?
Matt: That's all you see.
Laura: Did you see Umbrasyl?
Marisha: No, but I heard him. He sounds very rough, or possibly sleeping? I don't know, there was a lot of heavy breathing. Very deep-- not, you know, shallow breathing. Not impassioned breathing, Scanlan.
Laura: Could he still be invisible?
Marisha: He could I guess still be invisible. Also the cave was covered in acid pools and dark and dingy and everything else we would expect.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I know.
Travis: Let's do it.
Sam: Okay. We're going in the small hole or the big hole?
Marisha: I don't think he caught my presence. I don't think he's necessarily expecting us. We can have the element of surprise, here.
Liam: Let me check out that hole on top. You guys can watch me do it.
Laura: Go in the little hole, then.
Liam: I'm little now. It's a big hole. It's quite big, actually.
Laura: It's roomy.
Liam: I'd like to climb up to it.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead--
Liam: Spider-sense tingling the whole time.
Matt: All right. So you manage to find bits of rock and pull yourself across the way. It's not too long a distance but enough to the point where I need you to go ahead and make a basic strength check.
Liam: 14.
Matt: 14. Okay. It's hard and you feel part of your muscles build up lactic acid from the exertion, from the previous round with Umbrasyl and you not being necessarily the strongest individual of the troupe, but you do manage to scurry your way up to the edge of this small opening in the mountainside. Getting inside, you get a look: this hole continues for about 15 feet into the mountain before it ends abruptly. The only other thing you notice is there are currently four long-dead skeleton corpses within this hole. Perhaps some sort of mountain-climbing expedition or travelers that found their way there, and couldn't escape. There are remnants of a small camp. Perhaps a small fire that is long iced-over through winters past. A layer of dust sits on everything and other than the occasional gust of wind that finds its way in here, largely undisturbed for a long period of time.
Liam: I want to look through the remains.
Matt: Okay. You rummage through the remains. You find roughly 85 gold pieces amongst their corpses and spare change in silver and copper--
Liam: I don't take that.
Matt: Copper. The pennies of D&D. Poor things. Copper dragons everywhere are just so disappointed. You do find an oil lantern, climbing gear for four people, some long-spoiled rations. And you find a very moldy diary.
Liam: I take out the Flametongue Dagger and give myself some light.
Matt: As you're scanning through most of the pages that are still intact and not completely molded over or destroyed, it appears to be a journal that contains writings of what was an expedition to reach the peak of Gatshadow, because there was some sort of movement, some sort of activity up there that nobody could really discern. The rumors speak of some sort of creature that would stalk out in the night and steal mountain goats. (belches) Pardon me. Goats! Steal mountain goats, steal or find and kill anybody who lived in-- there used to be a smaller village that lived north on the mountainscape that is now abandoned because of this creature the folklore of the time said supposedly lived at the top of the mountain. It speaks of the entrance, the place that Umbrasyl now calls the lair, and this leads you to believe that this is a fresh lair. Umbrasyl did not appear to always live within Gatshadow, but is only currently making it its lair at the moment.
Liam: Is this a dead end? Does it look like it goes further in?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: By the light of my dagger.
Matt: Actually, this would be investigation.
Liam: Investigation? All right. 20. No, wait-- Yeah, 20.
Matt: 20. Feeling along the walls, you find elements of the rocks that are easier to break off than others, but this is predominantly the end of this cavern.
Liam: It's a cave. Okay. I tell my sister  it's a dead end. It's nothing. Coming.
Matt: So Vax finds his way back to the group.
Sam: It's a dead end? Jesus. This ain't going to be good. Shale, would you like to lead the way?
Chris perkins: Yes. Now, I may not survive this. I'm quite old, and I can only see about 30 feet ahead of me--
Laura: Well then, maybe she doesn't lead the way. (laughter)
Liam: My sister and I should lead the way. You stick to Grog, will you, grandma?
Chris perkins: I whack him. (laughter)
Matt: (whack sound)
Liam: Wait! I don't get to dodge?
Matt: No. Because, unexpected, she is swift, and she is strong for being one-armed and of her age. The sting hits the side of your shoulder before you have a moment to really understand and your diminutive form is thrown about three or four feet back before you catch yourself.
Travis: (laughter)
Liam: I skitter off ahead of the group.
Marisha: I cast Protection from Acid on Grog, again.
Chris perkins: Now, if I don't survive, loves, I do have some magic on me. So this staff has runes. You can scratch them off and magical things will appear! And this horn, if you blow it real loud, it will let out a tremendous thunder that could bring down the entire cave.
Sam: I don't think you should be planning for your own death!
Laura: I'll take the horn.
Chris perkins: It might explode.
Sam: It might explode?!
Chris perkins: It's a little unstable.
Laura: Scanlan, you should take the horn.
Sam: She's not dead yet!
Laura: I'm saying when she dies. If she dies.
Sam: We're not going to divvy up her stuff! That's bad luck!
Liam: She's bequeathing it to you in her will.
Chris perkins: And this pendant here, which looks like a dragon tooth, it's a dragon tooth. And if you wear it, it will close your wounds.
Laura: Could I insight check her? I feel like she's lying through her teeth. (laughter)
Matt: Make an insight check.
Sam: Maybe we should just kill her now and take the stuff.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: Really? So, Chris?
Chris perkins: I'm being super sincere.
Laura: Oh. I really want all those things--
Chris perkins: She honestly believes. (laughter)
Marisha: Shale, you seem almost like you're--
Chris perkins: My hide armor ain't worth shit.
Marisha: As I was saying, you seem like you're almost expecting to die, or you're looking forward to it?
Chris perkins: Well, I'm very old. And if I could die fighting a dragon, well, there's no better way to go. If I don't die, great! Wonderful!
Marisha: All right. Just checking that we wouldn't disappoint you if you don't die.
Travis: Wait, just to be clear  if we kill the dragon, are you going to say you killed the dragon or would you say I killed the dragon? Who's going to be the greatest goliath?
Chris perkins: Why, you, of course.
Travis: Yeah?
Chris perkins: I'm past my prime.
Travis: We'll shake on it?
Chris perkins: I will shake on it.
Matt: Which is easy because you put out the proper hand for the one arm she has.
Chris perkins: You want to mess with her, put out your other hand. (laughter)
Marisha: Shale, what type of magic do you wield, exactly?
Chris perkins: I wield this staff.
Marisha: Okay. Very clear.
Taliesin: This is going to be great! I'm on board and committed to this. This is very exciting!
Sam: Thank you, Shale. Let's try to live.
Marisha: So remember, acid pools everywhere. Do we have any type of cohesive plan, or just--
Sam: We're just going to go in.
Taliesin: Just be very quiet.
Liam: I'm already looking for traps, looking for danger.
Matt: So you're coming up to the entrance.
Liam: I'm not going to go in the entrance, but I'm going to try to climb up and peer over the edge and look as carefully as I can.
Matt: Go ahead and make another strength check.
Liam: 17.
Matt: You manage to climb your way up to the larger mouth of the cavern. It's about 40 feet across at the very front of it. And about 50 feet up. It's this large--
Liam: 40 feet, 50 feet?
Matt: Yeah. And the rest of you guys? Are you pursuing?
Sam: I'm going to come.
Matt: Rest of you climbing along the mountain as well?
Sam: Wait, is that the way in?
Travis: Is there anything you can do to make the dragon visible with his invisibility? Set fire, or your faeries?
Marisha: I do have Faerie Fire. You combine the two things that you said and it's fantastic.
Travis: Totally meant to. Okay. I'm just climbing. I'll follow them.
Matt: All right. Everyone who's climbing, I need you to roll a strength check.
Marisha: Wait! Who's climbing where?
Matt: There's no actual walkway to it.
Laura: Does anybody want to ride the broom with me?
Taliesin: I'll ride the broom. I'm not a climber.
Sam: My Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, are those attuned items?
Matt: I don't think they are, no.
Sam: I'll put on my Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, which I got two years ago.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: 19.
Sam: I don't know what they do.
Matt: Advantage on the roll.
Sam: Oh, great! 16.
Matt: 16? Okay.
Chris perkins: 18.
Matt: 18. All right.
Ashley: 12.
Matt: Okay. And you're floating up?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All of you begin to shimmy across the surface. The wind is piercingly cold. The clouds up here are dark and there isn't enough moisture to rain, but there are flashes of some sort of wild lightning storm that go off in the distance in the roiling clouds. As you're making your way across, Pike, your foot skips across one of the stones, it breaks and falls beneath you and you almost lose yourself. Grog grabs you, and holds you in place, and pulls you back up.
Ashley: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: Nobody saw anything.
Ashley: I thought I would be stronger, but I'm still not.
Travis: You're a champ.
Laura: Wait! Aren't you wearing the strength gauntlets?
Ashley: Yes, I am. That brought me to 12. (laughter)
Matt: You all slowly make your way to the very mouth of the cavern. You've been at this point, as well. You wanted to go ahead and make an investigation?
Liam: Scootching in, yeah.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. Feeling around the exterior, there are two rocks that are nearly identical, placed at each side of the cavern entrance. Upon approaching, their texture and their weathered appearance is far younger than the rest of the stone around them, and that catches your attention.
Liam: Do I need a further investigation check to discern their nature?
Matt: The nature is some semblance of a magical enchantment. This is a little beyond your understanding unless you want to try and roughshod it in the way you know how.
Travis: Call me up to the front. We got this.
Liam: Scanlan, do you want to grab that big...
Sam: Big what?
Liam: Shale.
Sam: Oh, Shale.
Liam: And yourself.
Sam: You got a trap up there, friend?
Liam: Something. There's rocks up here that look a little funky and I don't think they actually are rocks.
Sam: Rocks? Hey Keyleth, you should go. There are rocks. You could do something with rocks--
Marisha: I love rocks!
Sam: Yeah, I know. Go up there with Shale. Shale's a rock. Go.
Marisha: Okay. What's happening? Where am I?
Liam: Just come up a little bit slowly. There are a couple of rocks up here that look a little funny to me. Don't step on me.
Marisha: Oh right! You're so tiny right now. I keep forgetting that.
Chris perkins: You're very brave for someone so small!
Marisha: Do you want me to put you in a little pouch? Could be like a kangaroo?
Sam: We're going to die!
Liam: Another time.
Matt: As Keyleth and Shale approach the threshold that you're currently standing at, the rest of you are a little ways behind. He points out these two stones. Go ahead and both of you guys make an arcana check. Shale, just from what you've seen in the world.
Chris perkins: Right. 13.
Marisha: I think like, seven. Pretty sure my arcana-- It's seven.
Matt: Oh, druids. You ascertain, Shale, just from stumbling upon such constructions, this is-- There's some sort of magical essence to these rocks. It's old magic, which is the only reason you really recognize it. It's not the hoity-toity-learned-in-a-tower magic all the stupid people in the world tend to learn. This is old magic. That's all you were able to pick from it.
Liam: You know what it is?
Chris perkins: Old magic. (laughter)
Liam: Hey, dirty bard, could you come up here?
Sam: Oi! I'm here now. Sorry. I thought that the rock people could handle it.
Liam: All hands on deck.
Marisha: Scanlan, it's a very pretty rock--
Sam: 11 on arcana.
Matt: It's old magic.
Sam: This is old magic. (laughter)
Sam: Not the kind you learn in those hoity-toity towers.
Ashley: What's going on down there? (laughter)
Sam: Can't you just melt the rocks, Keyleth?
Marisha: Pike, these are very attractive rocks. What does it look like?
Sam: It looks like a rock. Melt it!
Marisha: No. What does it look like? Is it like a slate?
Matt: There are two stones about three to four foot in diameter that are almost matching, that are younger, less weathered than the rest of the stonework around them.
Chris perkins: Is there any way to circumvent them? Or are they in opposite sides?
Matt: They're on opposite sides. You could circumvent them, they're not in your path.
Marisha: I can alter their shape. I can melt, I can do something with them.
Liam: No. Just, they're not real. A few steps back. Trickfoot's--
Marisha: What do you mean, they're not real?
Ashley: I walk up.
Laura: Can you dispel that shit?
Ashley: Yes. Is it magic--?
Sam: It's old magic. (laughter)
Chris perkins: It's old magic. (laughter)
Taliesin: Not the kind of magic you learn in ivory towers.
Chris perkins: Older-than-me magic.
Ashley: That's just old. (laughter)
Sam: It sort of has that old smell to it.
Liam: Hey, fuck it. I'm going to take a good, hard look at this rock.
Marisha: Hang on. We might be able to circumvent it. Right? Can we go around it?
Ashley: I have Dispel Magic, but I wonder if we should use it.
Sam: Dispel that magic!
Ashley: But that's one of my last spells!
Laura: Well then, let's avoid them. Let's just go around them.
Marisha: Is there room on either side of them?
Matt: They are embedded in the sides of the wall. So you could pass through them, over them, however else you want to try and circumvent them.
Marisha: How about this? I'm going to cast Stoneshape, and can I carve out a little path around one of them, on the edge? Carve a little recess?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Sam: See? Rocks! I told you!
Marisha: Rocks!
Taliesin: Old rocks. Not the kind of rocks one finds in ivory towers.
Matt: Yes. Your 4th-level Stoneshape. You cause a portion of the rock wall at the side of the cavern to actually forge itself into a tunnel, circumventing the exterior rock on the left.
Laura: Could you just do that the entire way into the cavern?
Marisha: I can do it two more times. All the way into the cavern.
Sam: Okay. Let's go through the new hole.
Liam: I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to keep doing the same. Come on, you big giant dummy.
Laura: I'm on a broom, do you want to ride it with me? Just kidding-- Percy's already on.
Liam: I'll stealth ahead and look around.
Matt: Okay. So roll your stealth check.
Liam: A new stealth check?
Matt: Yeah, because you've come out of stealth and back into it.
Liam: Okay. Well, I still have Pass Without a Trace, right? So I'm at 40.
Matt: So you make your way into the next portion. You're actually able to start seeing--
Taliesin: Whoa! Slowly!
Liam: You people don't see shit.
Laura: Oh, that's acid!
Matt: --in a raised platform, in a pool of somewhat pungent-smelling liquid as you get even remotely close to it, the fume causes your sinuses to open and burn and tingle.
Liam: They barely get in.
Laura: Yeah. (cutesy voice) It's too small...
Liam: I'm just going to hold still for a second and listen. Do I hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27? You hear a very faint breathing. Breathing that is trying to stay quiet, but by the sheer immensity of the beast creating the sound, you can pick up the very subtle movement of air through the normally still cavern. (faint breathing noise)
Liam: I'm going to quietly take-- I'm going to back up 15 feet. (whispers) For everyone who's next to me, and for those who are not, it is in here. It is awake. And it is waiting for us.
Chris perkins: What did he say?
Liam: Pike. Don't. Move.
Ashley: I'm so still.
Liam: Just coming running to go when shit goes down, but don't move.
Travis: (whispers) What about putting her on my back?
Liam: Grog, don't move yet. I'm going to go back in for another look.
Sam: Alone?
Matt: Stealth.
Liam: Well, yeah. I'm not a barbarian. I'm going to go along the edge closest to you and move back to where I stopped to listen.
Matt: About there would be in tandem with where you were.
Liam: And I'm going to go another ten feet in, looking.
Matt: As he curls back, the cavern is revealed further. The pool does come to an end. There are pieces of stone that jut out of the floor. You do see now, scattered across the grounds, occasionally a bit of shine, a little coin-- gold, silver-- elements of wealth that've been dragged deeper into the cavern that have left behind them some remnants in the process of being carried and carted in.
Liam: If I look back, can I see my sister from where I am?
Matt: Actually, no. Because she's really well stealthed.
Liam: She can't see me either?
Matt: No. You guys have no visual perspective on each other. You've all stealthed away from your own party.
Liam: Okay. There's a pool of acid right by me, yeah?
Matt: Yes, there is.
Liam: Is there dim light here?
Matt: The light grows dim at about this point, then it becomes darkness at about this point.
Liam: But you said that I can see a pool of liquid, right?
Matt: Yeah. What little bit of daylight that's coming in the cavern entrance would be over here.
Liam: Is the surface of the liquid flat as far as I can see?
Matt: What you can see, it is flat. There's a little, very faint breeze that occasionally comes through so there's a slight disturbance here and there, but no specific visual disturbance.
Liam: How far along that pool can I actually see? If you had to do a cut-off point?
Matt: Because of your darkvision, being an elf, you can see pretty much to the edge of this.
Liam: Okay. So it doesn't look like there's a big divot?
Matt: There's no displacement of the pool.
Liam: I'm going to creep along the wall towards that pillar. I'll stop in that corner, and then move towards you one. Does it give me a better view?
Matt: A little bit of a further view, just the cavern continues in that direction.
Liam: Can I still hear the same thing?
Matt: You can hear it very faintly. You can't quite make out the source. There is something about the room and the air that's travelling through here. The sound itself, you're just barely catching it and it seems to be reverberating to a small extent off the walls of this cavern, which carry sound very well.
Liam: What do I see if I look up?
Matt: You look up, you see about 60 feet, 70 feet in the air, just past where your vision begins to fade-- The only reason you know there's a ceiling there is because there are a few points of rock, the top of the cavern does descend into stalactites-- it is?
Chris perkins: Stalactites, yes.
Matt: Yes. Thank you.
Liam: There's no large outcrops that this thing could be sitting on?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The mineral build-up of the inside of this cavern leads to a direct, slick surface in the walls. The minerals rounded off most of the stone.
Liam: I'm going to backtrack. I'm going to find my sister. And I'm still very little. It's at the back of that cavern. It's not in the pool of acid that's near the front, and it's not just past that. It keeps going back. So if we're going to do this, and we're all just going to throw ourselves into it, and let the chips fall where they may. The best thing that I can do right now is take it unawares, hurt it for as much as I can--
Laura: Are you kidding me right now?
Liam: I'm not kidding you! I want to kill this thing. This is the first stepping stone, and I could potentially take it out. Catch it unawares before it vomits on all of you. I want to do it, and I just want to know that you're going to come in after and finish it if you need to. I told you what I want to do.
Laura: All right. I will give you a minute head start to get across the room. After that, I'm coming in. So you better hope you're at the dragon by that point.
Liam: I start off. Come back and tug. (whispers) Jenga.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: I'm going back to where I was.
Matt: All right. What is it?
Liam: With Pass Without a Trace? 43.
Matt: All right. So you're back where you were. The rest of you, what are you doing?
Chris perkins: Well, he's a mad little one, isn't he?
Sam: He's not usually little. (laughter)
Liam: I'd like to go around the column, and around the edge of the wall.
Matt: This opens up slightly more, and you get to see a portion of the mineral growth-- a lot of the moisture that has coalesced into the ceiling has come into a central point, and over time, it just built up these central columns of rock and natural materials. A few pools have gathered towards the base. You see portions of the ground where elements of the acrid liquid that filled the pool over here just dripped in. Whether they began this way or turned by the dragon's presence, you are unaware. But that's as far as you can see.
Liam: Further along the wall, that little rock-- yeah. And just a little bit past it. And then closer to you.
Matt: At this point, you can make out that additional pool of acid, the far back corner and a risen platform, you see the portion of the cavernous stone beginning to mass into a higher level towards the far back corner.
Liam: I listen.
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20. You listen in... Silence. Stillness. The very faint whisper of wind far behind you.
Liam: Around the entire wall. Further, past that pool of acid, even. Further corner.
Sam: Has it been a minute yet?
Taliesin: About half a minute.
Matt: As you come around this corner, being as careful as you can, looking around you-- (impact). Your shoulder hits something.
Liam: Stab.
Matt: Roll initiative.
Liam: I'm going to call it. I mean, mostly I'm 14. I'll take it, that means 19.
Matt: All right. So you have just bumped into the currently invisible form of Umbrasyl lying in wait in the far corner of the cavern. That would be a 20 initiative from Umbrasyl.
Liam: Fuck. You.
Laura: How long has it been?
Matt: At this travel pace, it's been about 45 seconds or so.
Liam: Jenga! (laughter)
Matt: You hear "Jenga!" out of the back of the earring as, let's say the rest of you guys are right here.
Laura: I still want to be stealthed on the broom but I take off into the cavern.
Matt: I assume Trinket is in your necklace?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All right. This is going to be you, with your big stick.
Chris perkins: Awesome!
Matt: Chilling here with the rest of the party. So, at the top of this round, you just hear the growl, the snarl. (snarling) You say "Jenga," blades already at the ready, you go to stab as (swooshing) all of a sudden, you hear this swishing sound of air being cut through at such a speed that it causes a high-pitched whine. Claws and teeth come spinning out of nowhere. You can't even see your attacker but you feel the brunt force behind each of these blows.
Liam: Because it's invisible, is there no Uncanny Dodge?
Matt: No, you've still got Uncanny Dodge on one of the attacks. Just from your roguish instincts.
Liam: Displacer Cloak.
Matt: Correct. It gets disadvantage on the first attack, which is going to be a bite. That's a natural 19, and a two! With the two, that brings it to a 17.
Liam: Nope.
Matt: So with that, you (whoosh) see for a split second, the ripple of teeth snap before you, missing your face by mere inches before they disappear once again. Two more claws (whoosh) towards you. The first one, that's a 19 again and a seven. That's going to be a 22.
Liam: Just hits. Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Oh, your AC would be 20 because you're not hasted right now.
Liam: Oh, you're right. Thank you.
Matt: So that would put you at 18 points of slashing damage.
Liam: Halved to nine.
Matt: Halved to nine. Also your displacement is gone from your cloak.
Liam: For this round?
Matt: Yeah. For the next attack, it's a 19. Misses you? 20? Yeah. The second claw swings through, at this point, from the pain of the first strike of the dragon claw hits you, you back up to the very edge of the cave and duck out of the way as you hear the wind change. As you do, you hear the stone crash behind you as the claw misses you, slamming instead to the side of the cavern wall. It's now your turn.
Liam: I'm going to stay right here. I'm going to hold my turn until one of my friends is on top of this thing and then I'm going to stab it.
Matt: You hold your action until one of your friends is on it and then you move? Okay.
Liam: Not on it, but against it, attacking it. Melee attack.
Matt: So that ends your turn. Everyone else, I need you to roll initiative.
Marisha: Oh, shitballs!
Travis: Balls of shit.
Marisha: Whoa! Percy!
Matt: Your initiative from before was--?
Liam: 19.
Matt: So 25 to 20?
Laura: 22.
Taliesin: 30.
Marisha: He rolled a natural 20!
Matt: (laughs) Percy!
Laura: Are you on the broom with me still?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm hanging so I can drop.
Matt: So that's 20. 20 to 15?
Chris perkins: Another 19.
Matt: Another 19! Nice!
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: 18.
Laura: Nice, Pike!
Matt: So Pike then Keyleth.
Travis: A mere 16.
Matt: Scanlan, what did you get? (laughter)
Sam: I got an eight.
Matt: And Scanlan taking the rear. As you guys hear the crashing of stone at the far corner accompanied directly after the whisper of Vax's cry-out of "Jenga!" you already know shit is going down. Percy, you're up first. Clutching the bottom of the broom that has not moved yet, what are you doing with your turn?
Taliesin: I'm going to drop down. I'll let go of the broom. I'm going to just fire blind where I heard the noise coming from.
Matt: So you're firing in this direction?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: Go ahead and make your attacks at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Disadvantage. That is a 25.
Matt: Due to the massive size of this currently still invisible entity, you do manage to catch an odd bullet towards its form. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Oh my god. Ten points of piercing damage.
Matt: All righty. (gunshot sound) Gun goes off, echoes, little bit of dust comes loose from the ceiling and falls down as you ready for your next shot.
Taliesin: I'll take the next shot. Forget it. Might as well go for it.
Matt: At disadvantage.
Taliesin: That's 20.
Matt: This time, the shot goes the second time (gunshot sound) poofs against some stone in the distance, not hitting its mark.
Taliesin: Third shot for the run. Fucking--
Marisha: Natural 20.
Taliesin: And a one.
Matt: So with that, the third shot (click), nothing emerges from it. And you look down. It's not been a day for Percy.
Taliesin: It's not been a day for Percy. I'm going to start making a dash into the corner there, up in the--
Matt: Not a dash, because you used your action.
Taliesin: No, I'll make a run. Yes, to the wall.
Chris perkins: Is that some sort of weapon?
Taliesin: Not anymore, it's not!
Matt: As she takes her one good arm and cleans out, missing an eye now or maybe missing an eardrum. (laughs) That's going to end your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Oh god, this is a terrible idea. I'm going to roll and hide behind that pillar behind me. If that's okay?
Matt: This one, right here?
Taliesin: Yeah. I've got to fix this.
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: Yes. I'm going to fly on my broom as far in as I can. And land, maybe on that? And just shoot arrows towards where I heard it coming from. I feel like I have one blazing bowstring left, because I used it once in the last battle, right?
Matt: You would still have one more use, yes.
Laura: Okay. Then I'm going to try it through the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Go for it. At disadvantage on this shot, as you cannot see the actual entity. You're firing into the darkness.
Liam: Natural 20. And another natural 20?
Laura: Piece of shit! 19.
Matt: 19? Nope!
Ashley: Oh! War God's Blessing.
Matt: Okay. As your reaction, you guide her-- though the blazing bowstring was unfortunately used on the first attack that missed.
Laura: That was just for the first attack. I rolled twice for disadvantage. So that's the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Okay, I misunderstood. As you go for the attack, you see the actual arrow bursting into flames, not quite sure where to fire. You're about to pull back and aim and Pike shouts to you, putting her hand out. Suddenly, a spark of divine energy hits the front of the bow and corrects its course, beyond your actual arm motion, and you release, based on the faith you have in Pike. The arrow strikes true. You hear a slight growling roar from the distance. Go ahead and roll damage.
Ashley: Strike good and true!
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22, nice.
Laura: On my first attack! If I release Trinket, is that an attack? Or is that a bonus action?
Matt: It would say in the actual item.
Laura: Raven's Slumber. You can make a melee attack. No, that's not it. Bonus action to release it! I'm going to use a bonus action, and I'm going to shout at Trinket to go run towards my brother. I'm going to attack it again.
Matt: You send Trinket out, ten feet in front. Trinket is going to go-- it's 40 feet, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Trinket rushes forward there. You go make your second attack. Trinket goes: (angry bear growls) big old grizzly bear charging into the darkness, growling echoing through the cavern.
Laura: Oh, disadvantage. 27.
Matt: 27 with disadvantage still hits, yeah. Your honed senses to dragon-kind, you can remember the mass, and general size and placement based on the sound you heard from the growls from the first impact you made. You just strike again in the same direction, hitting true. Roll damage.
Laura: 12.
Matt: 12 damage.
Laura: Is that sneak attack because my brother is next to it?
Liam: It's occupied with me.
Laura: So I would have gotten the sneak attack on both those? Or just on the one?
Matt: Just on the one. Yes, I'll allow it because he is currently threatening it. It was a lucky shot. It was a very lucky shot.
Laura: Additional five.
Matt: All righty, good to know. So, total of--
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17. Thank you. Both arrows done. Trinket rushing in--
Laura: I want to duck down if I can, behind that whatever that I'm standing on now.
Matt: You can duck down, but you've used most of your action in this turn to sail in, and you can't hide per se.
Laura: Okay. I just want to duck behind it so I'm away from anything flying at me.
Matt: Makes sense. All right, so we're now at 20. At this point in time, the roar hits (roaring), echoing through the cavern. As the echoing begins to vibrate and the noise doesn't subside, the low hum turns instead to a (buzzing) as seemingly out of the pool of acid, a cloud of biting, stinging insects emerges.
Marisha: He did Insect Plague.
Matt: (buzzing) Floats in this direction, getting the three of you right there. I'll say for the purposes of this that you guys are both in that radius. Anyway, this cloud of insects moves in to-- I need Percy, Shale, and Vex to make constitution saving throws.
Chris perkins: Aw, eight!
Taliesin: 21.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. So you guys both, being dexterous and quick, but also able to maintain your form-- the best you can at this turn-- manage to pull out of the way without too much impact. However, poor Shale is surrounded by the insects.
Chris perkins: Slow and half-deaf.
Matt: You take 12 points of piercing damage as the insects riddle you with bites and stings.
Sam: Shale, do you have any gold teeth or hidden savings accounts that we should also know about?
Laura: She can't hear you, she's deaf.
Matt: At this point now, you hear a few footfalls, Vax. You see a splash in the pool next to you that almost scatters against you, bits of it hitting the edge of your armor, but the armor absorbs the blow, being attuned towards acid resistance. A few other steps as it begins to walk away. I'll allow you to make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage--
Liam: With disadvantage, but-- Yeah, okay.
Matt: Yeah, as you sense that it's moving away, you wildly swing out in front of you.
Liam: Nah. 15.
Matt: 15. Whiffs on air. However, (heavy footfalls) moving forward. A voice comes roaring out into the area, "You dare soil my home after what you've done below?! I will watch you dissolve before I suck down your liquid forms!" I need Vex, Pike, Keyleth, Scanlan, and Percy to all make dexterity saving throws.
Taliesin: Do I not have cover?
Matt: Not enough to prevent this. It's a lobbed stream of liquid acid that comes and surrounds, corroding.
Laura: Do we get advantage on any of it?
Matt: Not unless you have something that gives you advantage on him.
Taliesin: I'm spending a Resolve because that was bullshit. Can I burn another Resolve? Goddamn it.
Matt: Nope. All right, so.
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words to buff my roll?
Matt: You use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.
Sam: But not to-- That seems right, yeah. All right. 18.
Matt: 18, all right. Hold on, I'll just double-check while you're saying this. Just to bring up the ability.
Sam: I should know this.
Matt: It would have to be a damage roll, because there's no attack roll. There's no other roll incorporated on this other than the damage roll.
Sam: Got it. It just happens.
Matt: Right. But it reduces the damage roll, which affects everybody.
Ashley: Wait! I think I cast Resistance. I cast it on Keyleth, I cast it on--
Laura: Me. And I think you cast it on Scanlan.
Matt: It's faded since it's a concentration spell.
Taliesin: Scanlan's got the armor.
Matt: Yeah. If you were to use Cutting Words on this, it would reduce the damage all of you would take from it.
Sam: All right, I will use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.
Matt: What are your cutting words, Scanlan?
Sam: My cutting words are, "Your lower intestine smells like shit!" (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and roll your bardic inspiration die.
Sam: A ten? Shit roll. Three!
Matt: So 18 saving throw. What was yours?
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Keyleth?
Marisha: 14.
Matt: Vex? One. Pike?
Ashley: Seven.
Matt: Seven. Okay, reduced by three, you all suffer 47 points of acid damage.
Sam: Including me, with my acid armor?
Matt: You take half of that.
Laura: Aren't you glad I gave you the armor?
Matt: You take 23 points of acid damage. After its long, angry, boastful diatribe, as it rears back to blow, your words confuse it, and the spray seems a little off-center than what it intended. However, most of you are now currently dealing with the searing pain of the acid pressed against your bodies. Ending that turn, Vax, you're up.
Liam: Did I see where the ejection of acid came out from?
Matt: You did. It came from there, this area.
Liam: Am I still at a disadvantage even though I saw right where that crap came out?
Matt: Correct. Because you don't know if it moved away or not. You don't know exactly where it is. You just know it's somewhere in that vicinity.
Liam: I'm going to throw two daggers at it. I hope that Trinket's near it, but we'll see. So, at disadvantage. Bollocks! That's 15.
Matt: Nope.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22 just hits. Trinket, however, is actually adjacent to Umbrasyl. So you could do sneak attack damage.
Marisha: Whoa! What's up?
Liam: Keen Dagger. It's 26.
Matt: 26. All right. So one dagger just vanishes into the darkness. The other one sticks into the hide for a second before disappearing in a plume of smoke, reappearing at the side of your belt. You hear a low (snarling grunt).
Liam: Can I use my movement to go along the back edge of the cave as far as I can? Directly opposite from my family.
Matt: All right. Looking at the rest of this cavern--
Laura: Look at all the gold, hiding over there!
Matt: There is what seems to be the majority of the funds that were gathered from Westruun, and whatever else of the previous dragon's hoard have currently been brought over to the new lair. Who knows how much has been--
Liam: I thought that was his magic healing spot, but I guessed wrong.
Matt: So, that end your turn?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Now it comes to Shale.
Chris perkins: I'm with insects, right?
Matt: You are currently surrounded by stinging, biting insects.
Chris perkins: Okay. I will stride forth. I'm slow and old. I move 20, so I'll use all my movement, 40, to advance.
Matt: There you go. You come pushing through, brushing them off with your stump and your staff, waving it in front. Angrily growling, you come to rest at the side of this one pillar that juts out of the ground, with Vex right above you.
Chris perkins: I'll dimly look into the darkness and see if I can see, hear, or there's just gray mist in front of my eyes right now.
Matt: You can't see anything. But you do hear right in front of you a growling, snarling bear. You see elements and flashes of the bear that you saw Vex summon forth from her throat.
Travis: And the dagger disappeared into something, right?
Chris perkins: All right. But I can't hear the dragon? At all? It's stomping around.
Matt: It's stomping around a little bit. You saw where the actual projectile came from, so you know it's somewhere in this vicinity.
Chris perkins: Well, you're not very brave, are you? Invisible! Hiding! Afraid to show your face? Taunt it. Oh, bollocks! (laughter)
Chris perkins: Well, that would be a nine.
Matt: A nine. You hear, slowly curling out from the darkness ahead of you, "Bravery means nothing. Survival and victory mean everything!"
Chris perkins: Oh, shut up, you flying suitcase!
Matt: And that's how you end a round. Pike, you're up.
Marisha: Oh, it's something my grandma would say. So good.
Ashley: Yeah. I'm going to hold my action and I'm going to backpack onto Grog.
Matt: Okay. So you move over and leap up onto Grog's back, holding tightly. What's the trigger for your action that you're holding?
Ashley: On his next attack on somebody.
Matt: The next time you sense the dragon is attacking somebody?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: All right. What action are you holding? Is it a spell?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: So you begin preparing the spell. You are now concentrating on it, as you're holding the back of Grog. Okay. Holding that bit, that brings us to Keyleth. What are you doing?
Marisha: If I move through Insect Plague, will I take damage? Or is it if I end in it?
Matt: You don't know.
Chris perkins: I seemed to waltz through it.
Marisha: That's true. You waltzed through it. And you didn't start in it, did you?
Chris perkins: I did.
Marisha: Oh. But you took the damage up top, you didn't take damage again after you got out of it. All right. I want to see if I can move. I'm having a hard time seeing, Matt. Can I get my full movement of 30 feet into this corner here?
Matt: Over here?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You're going to get up around there, unless you want to try and go over the top of the rocks. That way is going to require a climb check.
Marisha: Oh really, I can parkour it? Yeah!
Matt: All right, go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: 14.
Matt: Yeah, it's not too hard. You ran up, grab, leap over the side. You can get right there.
Marisha: Oh, okay. I think the dragon is roughly here?
Matt: In this vicinity. You can see Trinket is currently snarling and lashing out and biting in this area of the cavern.
Marisha: I'm really sorry, Grog. I'm going to cast Faerie Fire, roughly-- Yeah, somewhere where I think he is.
Laura: Why is that bad?
Marisha: Means you don't have acid resistance anymore. It's a concentration spell. But none of us can see him, yeah.
Matt: All righty. So, Faerie Fire. You guys watch as suddenly, this burst of somewhat violet-ish blue light, like a small, tiny explosion of glitter and starlight just hits the area and outlines the entirety of the large dragon Umbrasyl.
Marisha: And with my bonus action--
Matt: Yeah, failed saving throw.
Marisha: Damn right, he did. With my bonus action, I'm going to go into my--
Matt: Actually, you know what?
Marisha: He's going to do his thing, isn't he?
Ashley: You know, you don't need to.
Matt: Yeah, I do. Third and final legendary resistance. You get a glimpse of where Umbrasyl is and then the magic dissipates. Umbrasyl vanishes from sight.
Sam: Shit.
Taliesin: You've burned his third legendary action. You've burned it. It's gone.
Sam: Matt, did it also negate my disadvantage from Cutting Words, on the save?
Matt: He can succeed automatically. It's a choice to succeed.
Sam: Balls. So that's dead, too?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Does he use the legendary action before he fails?
Matt: No. That's true. Yeah.
Sam: So it kills that too?
Matt: It does, yeah.
Sam: Nice. No, my thing's dead too. He double-fucked us.
Marisha: Great. Fuck you, asshole!
Laura: He doesn't save it like that?
Matt: Well, no. Essentially he rolled at disadvantage to make the saving throw. Failed it. And then decided to succeed using legendary resistance.
Marisha: Okay. But it's gone! They're gone.
Ashley: They're gone, gone?
Matt: As far as you know, from previous experience with dragons, there are no further uses of its legendary resistance.
Marisha: What a dick.
Matt: Does that end your turn, Keyleth? It's a level one spell, you still have more up your sleeves if you wanted to try it later.
Marisha: I know. I don't think I'm going to go into my beast shape form so I can do another spell next turn. Can I just tuck and see if I could take a bonus action to hide in this little nook and cranny here?
Matt: You can't use a bonus action to hide, unfortunately.
Marisha: Because I'm not a rogue?
Matt: Because you're not a rogue. Sorry, girl.
Marisha: Can I hug that pillar and say, (panting)?
Matt: You can totally do that. And you are currently hugging in the pillar going, (panting). At the end of Keyleth's turn, it's going to use two of its legendary actions to wing attack. It's going to beat its wings, everything within 15 feet, which right now would only be Trinket, has to go ahead and succeed on a dexterity saving throw. Go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for Trinket.
Laura: I'm going to roll the brown dice for Trinket. Dexterity? 12.
Matt: 12. Okay. So Trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage--
Laura: He's resistant to bludgeoning!
Matt: Because of the armor?
Laura: Yes!
Matt: So takes seven points of bludgeoning damage. However, he is still knocked prone from the blast of wind that whooshes through the entirety of the cavern, causing dust to raise up. The cloud of insects gets shifted a little bit before having to reform back into its place from the sheer force. In doing so, suddenly, there's a rush of air, and two giant slamming sounds, as feet have placed themselves right up front with Shale and Vax. Vex. I've got a lot to concentrate on.
Sam: When I die, I'm coming back as a character named Vix.
Matt: Then you can find another Dungeon Master. All right, so that ends Keyleth's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I take the tiny Pike backpack, and I would like to run along the right, the farther wall from you. Opposite direction.
Matt: This way?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 50 feet, using diagonals to try and get as far around that pool as I can.
Matt: That's about as far as you can get there. So that's movement with Pike on your back. So, that's your movement?
Travis: Yep. And I'll use my bonus action to go into a rage.
Matt: All right. (growling)
Travis: Hey Pike, gimme a slap!
Ashley: (slap)
Travis: (growls)
Matt: Sends you into the rage. You still have your action. Anything you want to do?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: Are you holding your action for any particular thing?
Travis: Well, I can't really hit him from here.
Matt: All right. That ends Grog's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I can't see him, right?
Matt: Not from what you can tell, no.
Sam: Balls. I can see Vex, right? And Shale? Oh, shit. I can't do much without seeing him. Oh, here's what I will do: I'll start by inspiring Shale. I will just step out and sing, (singing) And I will always buff you! And then I will pick a place and cast Stinking Cloud.
Matt: Okay. You take your d10 inspiration die.
Chris perkins: Excellent.
Matt: And Stinking Cloud. Haven't seen that in a while.
Sam: No! Oh well, it's too late, I already said it.
Matt: Stinking Cloud. Where are you setting it?
Sam: Can I have a pointer? Well, I'll just come over. Right here.
Matt: Right there? All right. We'll put this over here to keep track of the Stinking Cloud, we'll just know the insects are in this vicinity as most people have passed beyond it. With that, Umbrasyl is going to attempt a constitution saving throw. Three plus 14, that's a 17. What's the DC?
Sam: 20.
Matt: All right. That will technically be at the start of its turn, but we will carry that over. All right. The cloud appears in this space. You can already hear (coughing). Are you going to move or stay where you are?
Sam: There's no more cloud of insects, yeah?
Matt: It's still in this vicinity.
Sam: Is there any way to avoid it? Move up to where Kiki is or anything?
Matt: Yeah, if you want to make a strength check to climb.
Sam: All right, I'll do that. I'll move up to where Kiki is. 17.
Matt: 17. Yeah, you actually hopscotch up, leap over Percy and get up on top next to her over there.
Sam: Oh, Percy! Didn't notice your bald spot there.
Taliesin: It just grows in lighter.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. With that, it's going to use its third legendary action this turn to attempt a tail attack against you, Vex.
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: You're welcome.
Liam: That's Vix.
Matt: I will stab you. That is a 19 to hit.
Laura: Nope. 20.
Matt: 20! With that, you dodge out of the way. You feel the impact of some large, heavy slam onto the stone right next to you. Pieces of it break off, and then withdraws, barely dodging it in time. All right, that ends--
Ashley: Since he made an attack, can I?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Ashley: I would like to Command him to be visible. Reveal himself.
Matt: What's the word?
Ashley: Reveal! Appear!
Matt: Appear. There you go! Oh, that's cocked. All right. That is a19 plus 11. I'm pretty sure it makes the save.
Ashley: Fuck you!
Matt: Sorry.
Ashley: Do I still get a bonus action?
Matt: That would've been during your turn. You can only hold your action.
Ashley: (snarls frustratedly)
Matt: Good try. Brings us to the top. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Oh god! Okay, I'm going to take a second to try and pray that my second gun doesn't break because that's going to get really ugly! And it doesn't! My gun is fine.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: My gun is fine. But that's it. I'm going to start running straight down, as far as my legs will take me. Not that way, towards the pool.
Matt: Towards the pool?
Taliesin: Right there. Oh no, that's the insects, that's right. So, yeah.
Marisha: As long as you get out of it.
Taliesin: I'm going to roll around to the stone to the right, then. As far as I can go.
Matt: You can get there. You're outside of the insect cloud, not a worry. As you're running, you're cleaning it, polishing, loading it. Okay, looks good.
Taliesin: Oh, yes. I'm going to spend my bonus action to do a quick heal.
Matt: Okay, your Second Wind?
Taliesin: My Second Wind.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Oh, god. That was awful. That's okay. So, yeah. Good. You can move on, sorry.
Matt: Okay. Vex.
Laura: Do I have any kind of sense of-- Ugh, your Stinking Cloud is right there.
Matt: Yeah. You do see some elements of the cloud are displaced in places. It's not showing you exactly where it is, but you are aware that the entity of Umbrasyl is directly in front of Shale, and nearly directly in front of you.
Marisha: Enough to negate the disadvantage?
Matt: No. Not to mention the fact that you are technically in its melee range. So any of your ranged attacks--
Laura: Are at disadvantage again, right?
Matt: Unless it's five foot. Is it five foot, or is it melee? Trying to remember. I think it's five feet. But regardless, it's close to you, it's bad news.
Laura: If Trinket gets up, does that use any of my stuff? Trinket can move freely--
Matt: Trinket can move independently of you.
Laura: So Trinket is going to get up.
Matt: It's half-movement, yeah.
Laura: And he's going to bite Umbrasyl's tail to try to distract him, so I can run between his legs.
Matt: Okay. So Trinket's going to go ahead and-- roll a perception check for Trinket.
Liam: Trinket, snack attack!
Laura: Oh, he's got a keen sense of smell, so he's got advantage on smell perception.
Matt: But there is a Stinking Cloud right there. Roll again. We'll see if Trinket can discern between--
Laura: Well, I rolled a 15. And I don't know what I add to it.
Matt: That would be Trinket's wisdom--
Laura: --oh, perception, seven. So 22
Matt: 22. Okay. Trinket (bear sniffs and growl) runs past here, but can only make 20 feet of its movement because he used the rest to get out of prone. However, strafes aside and begins reaching out and starts snapping, so you want to give Trinket--?
Laura: He's going to attack him.
Matt: Okay. As part of your attack action? Is that what you're doing?
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to have Trinket do one of his attacks so I can move and run.
Matt: As your bonus action on it? Okay, go for it. Have Trinket roll for an attack. With disadvantage because it is invisible.
Laura: That doesn't count? I feel like it still counts, though. It's only 15.
Matt: 15. Trinket slashes out in the air. With the obfuscation of the Stinking Cloud and the invisible dragon, Trinket's just getting mouthfuls of air.
Laura: What does Stinking Cloud do to me?
Marisha: Makes you sick.
Sam: Makes you sick.
Laura: Fuck. I try to run away. I try to run around and run past Umbrasyl.
Sam: You're not in the cloud.
Laura: But I would go through it if I tried to run between its legs. I'll just try to run along to the side.
Matt: On the broom, still?
Laura: Sure! Why the fuck not?! I'm on the broom. Does it matter?
Matt: I mean, that will give you a little more action, you just can't attack from the broom because you'll have disadvantage on your attacks since you haven't finished your set-up yet.
Laura: Jesus. I just want to run, on the broom, and use my bonus action. Is that as far as I can get?
Matt: As far as you can get on your regular feet.
Laura: On my broom, though?
Matt: There.
Laura: And can I use my bonus action to hide? Can I try to hide?
Matt: You are completely out in the open. You have no way of hiding right now. You be can like, "Hide! You don't see me!"
Liam: You can dash and get further away.
Laura: I'm going to dash and I'm going to get further away.
Liam: Rogue bonus action? Hide, dash, disengage.
Matt: Yes, you can.
Laura: Yeah! I'm going to hide behind those things.
Matt: There?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you can get there. However, as you rush by, Umbrasyl does get an attack of opportunity on you. He's going to make a bite as you rush by. That is going to be a 30 to hit?
Laura: I think that hits.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: Isn't it at a disadvantage since he's in smoke?
Matt: Huh?
Laura: Because he's in farts?
Matt: No. That's not quite what it does. (laughter)
Matt: Oh, that's a d10. Sorry. You take 25 points of piercing damage. Plus an additional eight points of acid damage from the inside of its mouth.
Laura: Cool. Tight, tight.
Matt: A total of 33 points of damage as you rush past. All right, that ends your turn, Vex?
Laura: Oh, that it does.
Matt: All right. The insect cloud fades away, insects just dying off and dropping to the ground in piles of currently twitching insects. However, the acid pools suddenly begin to rumble and expand and reach out.
Laura: I'm glad I hid by another acid pool.
Matt: Any creature within 20 feet of the pool has to make a strength saving throw. So that will be Shale, Grog, Pike and Vex.
Laura: Yay.
Chris perkins: Five!
Sam: You have inspiration, if you want to use it.
Ashley: What are we rolling for?
Laura: A strength or a dex saving throw?
Matt: Strength.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23, good to know. Pike?
Ashley: 21.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13. And? Five. All right, so you guys both manage to, as the pool swishes out and comes up to your knees, Grog, and you just pull back and lean against the wall. As the pool subsides back, no immediate effect. Just barely manages to catch you. However, both Shale and Vax are pulled 20 feet into the pool--
Laura: Vex.
Matt: I'm sorry. Vex. I keep saying it now. Over and over again. Pulled into the actual acid pool.
Laura: It's like adding insult to injury. You're going to die and I'm going to call you your brother the entire time.
Matt: Yep. I'm sorry about that. You both are knocked prone and pulled into the water. Because it is an acid pit, you both also suffer 12 points of acid damage. Both Shale and Vex.
Marisha: That's a thing that can happen. All right.
Matt: All right. Now Umbrasyl, who failed the saving throw--
Sam: Gets to spend his entire turn coughing.
Matt: I can't believe Stinking Cloud worked.
Sam: Spends his entire turn.
Matt: The creature spends its action retching and reeling.
Liam: I hope he coughs his innards out the hole in his gut. Dragon hernia.
Matt: Yep. So the action is spent, the dragon is just (coughing), which is good because it rolled a five and got its breath weapon back. But it can't use it this turn because it's coughing and "You-- I will-- " It rears back, about to spit the acid before (coughs) and bits of it come streaming out of the nose, like the milk-in-the-nostrils thing except for it's acid. That's the dragon. Okay. That ends its action. It is going to move out, see if it's-- I forgot to roll concentration for the Invisibility on the last attack that happened. I just rolled a one. With that, it appears once again on the map. The Invisibility spell no longer there.
Marisha: Oh, thank god!
Laura: Now we can watch it kill us.
Matt: It's going to stomp over, out of the cloud, right there.
Sam: Does Trinket get an attack?
Matt: He does, actually. Go ahead and roll for Trinket.
Laura: Yeah, he does! I don't know which one to roll here. They've all been betraying me. 17.
Matt: 17? That misses. Or it hits and Trinket's claws streak across the back of the dragon's hide. No damage sustained. But good job, Trinket. All right, so--
Laura: He's trying, man. He's out. He's so brave.
Matt: He's doing great. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to dart out behind the pillar of stone there. And I'm going to chuck a dagger at it.
Matt: All right. What's the far range on it?
Liam: 60. I'm a Sharpshooter, so there's no disadvantage.
Matt: He's out of range.
Liam: Then I'll move closer. I mean, I know how far I can throw a dagger, so I want to get up close enough to be within range to throw a dagger.
Matt: Still can't get close enough, not with your full movement. You can move 30 feet.
Liam: Where are you? You're in the acid?
Laura: I am in the acid.
Liam: Oh! I'm going to go to my sister, I'm going to drag her out and I'm going to pop the one healing potion I have down her gullet.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm going to pull her behind, so we're both behind that pillar.
Matt: Okay, so you pull her behind the pillar. You go ahead and feed her the healing potion. That is your turn. He dragged you out of the acid pool.
Liam: Potion of greater healing.
Matt: All right, so that is a 4d4 plus four healing to you. That ends Vax's turn. Shale, you're up.
Chris perkins: All right. I'm going to stand up if I can and make my way back onto firm rock. Do I take any damage when I start my turn?
Matt: You do, actually. You take six points of acid damage. You've now stepped up right there. The dragon is fully visible to you.
Chris perkins: Pick on someone your own size! And I whack him on the derriere with my staff.
Matt: Go for it. You have three attacks, correct?
Chris perkins: The first one is a very sad 14. I'm not going to waste the d10 on that.
Matt: Across the hide, no damage.
Chris perkins: Oh my god!
Marisha: No, Chris, no.
Sam: Inspiration?
Chris perkins: Natural one.
Matt: As a level 13 fighter, don't you get a third attack with your action?
Chris perkins: What's that? Oh, yes, you're right. That one, I rolled a 19. I will spend the inspiration die and turn it into a 26.
Matt: Okay. Roll damage with the quarterstaff.
Chris perkins: I do 11 points of whacky-whacky damage and try to bait this thing into turning on me.
Matt: Okay.
Chris perkins: I will also use my second wind.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Chris perkins: To regain 15 hit points.
Matt: 15 hit points to you, go for it. Ending Shale's turn, that brings us to Pike. But at the end of Shale's turn, the dragon is going to use a legendary action to attempt a tail attack against you, Scanlan, as you are the source of the Stinking Cloud that caused it to cough. It goes, (growls) "Foolish bard, get back into my stomach!" And as it whips around, its tail comes streaking overhead and it rolls a natural one! (cheering)
Matt: As it spins around, that's when your staff actually hits the back of its hide. As it does, it gooses it a little, in a sensitive place, and the tail arcs strangely and slams into the stone, next to you, missing you by about six inches.
Sam: Ah! Great. I'll take it.
Matt: Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: All right. (sing-song) I'm going to Guiding Bolt him right up the butt! (laughter)
Matt: You're in the position for it.
Ashley: Yep!
Matt: What level are you casting Guiding Bolt?
Ashley: Third.
Matt: Third level on Guiding Bolt. All right. That will put it at 6d6. So go ahead and roll a spell attack.
Ashley: Natural 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll 6d6 and we'll double it.
Ashley: And double it?
Matt: It's a critical hit.
Ashley: I've never done that before!
Chris perkins: Right up the butt!
Marisha: Monstah! Kill him!
Liam: Kan-cho!
Taliesin: Kan-cho!
Marisha: Kan-cho!
Ashley: Oh my god, 24! One more! So, 50 points.
Matt: 50 points of radiant damage right up Umbrasyl's posterior. Suddenly as Pike, still clutching onto the back of Grog, you reach and grab the symbol of Sarenrae, leaving your sword to the side of your sheath, hold it forward. And as you do, you concentrate, a glowing beam of radiant energy shoots forward just as Shale knocks the backside of Umbrasyl. The tail streaks overhead to hit Scanlan, leaves you a nice, direct shot right at the dragon rump. There's a dull (impact) sound, and Umbrasyl sits straight up for a second (confused noise, explosion) as there's a burst of divine, explosive energy right in the posterior (painful growl). Looking back, there's now a shiny glow, pulsing from the back of Umbrasyl's body. And the next attack has advantage against Umbrasyl.
Ashley: Still alive!
Matt: That's your action. You still have your movement and bonus, if you want.
Ashley: Okay. I think I'm going to stay, and then bonus action, I'm going to throw up a Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: Okay. Where do you want your Spiritual Weapon to go? What level is Spiritual Weapon, Second level? Yep.
Ashley: Yeah. A really large meathook.
Matt: All right. Where are you setting it?
Ashley: Right at his back.
Matt: All right. Sitting right there at the tail of Umbrasyl, this giant, glowing, radiant meathook appears and makes its strike. Go ahead and make your spell attack against Umbrasyl.
Ashley: 27.
Matt: All right. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. It's a 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Ten.
Matt: Nice, all right. Going to stay where you are? Or you going to move?
Ashley: I'm going to stay with my Grog.
Matt: So you're still piggybacking on Grog. Got it. Okay, that ends Pike's turn. Keyleth, you're up. Actually, at the end of Pike's turn--
Ashley: You know what, I'm sorry, I'm going to get off his back.
Matt: Okay. You're staying where you are, though?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so you'll be there. At the end of your turn, Umbrasyl's going to use another legendary action to make a second tail attack at Scanlan again, frustrated by this whole circumstance.
Sam: I'm sure he is.
Matt: That's a 20.
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words?
Matt: You may, if you want to.
Sam: All right.
Matt: It's a natural 20.
Sam: Oh?!
Matt: You could reduce the damage though, with your Cutting Words.
Sam: All right, I'll do that.
Matt: Probably for the best. For that, you suffer 28 points of bludgeoning damage. As the tail swoops down, finding its mark, slamming into you, sending you against the wall of the stonework, and you stumble forward back into place, feeling already the impact of the bludgeoning wound.
Sam: That's a four, so.
Matt: So you reduce that to 24.
Taliesin: That halved? No, that's not halved. Sorry-- brain!
Matt: So 24 points of bludgeoning damage from the attack. However, Umbrasyl's next saving throw is at a disadvantage because of Mythcarver. Now, Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Okay. Faerie Fire (poof) right in front of me. Right on top of him. It gives everybody advantage on attacks against him.
Matt: Yes, it does.
Laura: That's great.
Marisha: I hope he's got enough hit points to make it worth it.
Matt: With disadvantage on the saving throw.
Marisha: Yeah, take it, bitch! Glitter bomb! It's like a Kesha music video.
Matt: So that's a four plus nine because of the disadvantage. I rolled a ten and a four. That will bring it to 13. It does not succeed. You watch as a second burst of purplish energy surrounds Umbrasyl, radiating a glow.
Chris perkins: Who's the prettiest dragon?
Marisha: You're so pretty!
Matt: Gilmore would love this right now. "Fancy dragon! Now we're talking!" You went from being not able to see the dragon to very much being able to see the dragon. All right.
Marisha: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental.
Matt: Okay! Look at you being a druid and shit.
Marisha: Yeah. That's how I roll.
Travis: Get it, girl! Get it, get it, girl!
Marisha: Get it, girl! Get it, get it, girl!
Matt: Water elemental Keyleth. Are you going to stay there?
Marisha: Can I move?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Marisha: Am I in his range of attack?
Matt: You gather, yes. Pretty big range.
Marisha: Honestly, Umbrasyl is so fucking big, I can't see what's going on in front of me.
Matt: You're right there.
Marisha: Is Scanlan in front of me?
Matt: Scanlan is right next to you, to the right.
Marisha: Can I step in the front and shield Scanlan?
Matt: Unfortunately, the cliff ends right there. So you couldn't get in front of Scanlan without dropping onto a lower platform.
Marisha: What about anybody else?
Matt: Percy is down there. You could fill some of Umbrasyl's space but you're not going to be able to guard anybody from an attack, unfortunately. Especially being an entity made of water, not a whole lot of defensive strategy in there.
Marisha: Okay. I'm next to Shale as well, right? We're all in the shit together?
Matt: Shale's over here.
Marisha: Oh, Shale's over there.
Matt: Flanking from the side.
Marisha: You know what, I'm just going to stay there!
Matt: All right. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to run along the side of the pool, and up on his left side, closest to the entrance of the cave. Right there would be delicious.
Matt: There you go.
Travis: I would like to go into a frenzied rage. A regular strike on the first.
Matt: You already have advantage on all the attacks because of Faerie Fire. So you don't need--
Travis: Yeah, not reckless. Not great weapon.
Matt: Yeah. Go for it.
Taliesin: Is that a 20?
Ashley: Oh, oh! That would be a natural 20!
Sam: Oh! That's not going to be good for him.
Matt: Barbarian crits, man.
Travis: I keep rolling, yeah?
Matt: Well, do the damage for the critical, yeah.
Taliesin: This and the next round are going to be really ugly.
Marisha: Kill it. Fucking kill it!
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24. Okay.
Travis: Is the roll and then, what? Double it or add another--?
Matt: The dice roll is? Well, you roll 1d12. What was that, the first d12 you rolled?
Travis: That was a 15. Oh, the dice roll? 12.
Matt: 12. So make a-- it was a 12?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Oh, shit! Okay, that's a 24. And then you add your modifier. And then roll two more d12s. So, that's 24 plus, is that seven?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Plus the two for the axe. Oh my god! That'll be at 33. Plus the necrotic-- oh, fuck! And that's doubled too.
Travis: So that's an 11 for the second d12.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Should we write these numbers down?
Matt: Yeah, we have to now. So it's 24 plus two for the axe, plus seven for the strength.
Travis: Plus five for the necrotic--
Matt: Hold on, getting there. We're getting there. It's getting math crunchy here, guys. So 24 plus nine, so that's 33, plus-- the necrotic?
Travis: Five.
Matt: Times two, which is ten. That's 43, plus the two other d12s, which is an 11. So that's 54. Plus your last d12.
Travis: It's a ten.
Matt: You did 64 points of damage with this one critical hit.
Ashley: He's a monstah!
Travis: Monstah!
Marisha: Monstah!
Laura: Monstah!
Matt: All right. So that's your first attack.
Travis: Yeah.
Chris perkins: Dragon's like, hello!
Marisha: Disco dragon!
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20. The first strike swings wide and slams deep into an already open wound left by a rogue earlier in the sky. This time, the axe sinks deep into its body, and Umbrasyl roars out in immense pain. You see spittle and blood both being jettisoned from its mouth under the sheer pain that it's feeling. You take the axe, and you push even deeper, and push even deeper and withdraw. As you do, the blade is entirely covered in deep purplish-black dragon blood. You swing for a second strike. This time it puts its claw out and catches the axe in the middle of the air. You manage to wrench it free from its grasp, but it turns its head toward you, angrily.
Ashley: Can I use War God's Blessing again?
Matt: That is Channel Divinity? I'll go ahead and double-check here real fast.
Marisha: We also have Heroes' Feast up, by the way, if that makes any amount of difference.
Matt: It won't do anything. It helped you with the temporary hit points, it helped you with--
Sam: Fear?
Marisha: Fear?
Liam: Fear?
Matt: It helped you with the fear-resistance to begin with. That was a big one. Channel Divinity, War God's Blessing and you can Channel Divinity twice. So you can do it a second time, you can. Wait, didn't you use it-- between rests, yeah. You could do it a second time if you want to.
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: All right. So with that, with a plus ten brings it to 30. So, as Umbrasyl grabs the axe, stopping it in mid-air, you just grin, reach forward with the axe, and push it into its actual claw. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: You nasty, boy! 27.
Matt: 27 points of damage. All right. And do you want to use your bonus action?
Travis: I do.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Travis: Let's do it great weapon master, just for kicks.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 26 minus five is 21.
Matt: 21. As you push the blade into Umbrasyl's hand, (angry snarl) it rears back its head and snaps toward you. You duck out of the way, pull the blade back and go for a third strike. This time however, it actually rears its torso up, putting its claws in the air, and you (slicing) find air right beneath it. Does not strike true.
Travis: Cool. Good beans.
Matt: Yeah. That finishes Grog's turn. At the end of Grog's turn, it's going to use its third legendary action to go ahead and make a-- Actually, no, its going to hold onto that legendary action. All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Jesus, it's not dead yet?
Matt: Scanlan, because you took the tail attack earlier, I'll have you roll a concentration check for Stinking Cloud. You have advantage on it though, so add your constitution bonus.
Sam: 20.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine.
Sam: Great. I've got my Stinking Cloud, still. I would like to move the Stinking Cloud. Oh! No, I can't do that.
Matt: You can.
Sam: You can move a Stinking Cloud?
Matt: I think it moves from a short breeze, actually.
Sam: Eh, it's fine.
Matt: Older versions, I think you could.
Sam: I don't want the Stinking Cloud to move. All right, he's right on us, he's got a legendary action. This is not good. Okay, I will reintroduce him to Bigby's Hand, (singing) Bigby's Hand! And I'm going to use it as an-- Ugh, so weak! Interposing Hand.
Matt: Bigby's Interposing Hand, all righty.
Laura: What is that?
Sam: It will block him. It's a talk-to-the-hand move.
Matt: The idea is, you can use your bonus action to set it each turn to what you want it to do. So right now, you're having it as an Interposing Hand. So, yeah. It prevents it from moving--
Sam: Wait, just moving? It can still attack?
Matt: The Interposing Hand interposes between you and a creature you choose until you give it a different command. It stays between the two of you, providing you half-cover against the target. So it helps from ranged attacks.
Sam: Oh. But it won't block an attack. So in that case, I'll just attack with it.
Matt: Okay, so you're just going to go and Clenched Fist?
Sam: I'm going to try to finger it right in the hole that I came out of before.
Matt: Of course you are! Go ahead and make a melee spell attack.
Sam: He's the Bigby and the dike!
Matt: That would be over here
Sam: What do I roll? d20?
Matt: d20, add your spell attack modifier.
Sam: Oh! 27. Oh! With advantage? 27.
Matt: 27, that hits. Go ahead and roll 4d8 force damage, as Bigby angrily jams the magical finger back into the wound.
Ashley: Rage fingering?
Liam: This dragon is being violated in so many ways.
Sam: It's just ten. 4d8 plus what?
Matt: It's 4d8 force damage.
Sam: That's it, ten.
Matt: Ten points of force damage.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Not like this!
Matt: All right, Scanlan, are you going to move or stay where you are?
Sam: If I move, he'll kill me, so I won't. Instead, I will-- where's Vax?
Matt: Vax is over here.
Sam: Way over there?!
Liam: Playing medic with my sister.
Laura: Hey!
Sam: Jesus. Who can I inspire? I guess I'll inspire good old Shale again. You don't need inspiration, you're fine! This is an old lady! I'll turn to Shale and say, I don't normally do this, but I find you so attractive! For an old lady!
Chris perkins: Focus on the dragon!
Sam: I can't! With your eyes-- eye? Eye so beautiful! So twinkling when it looks at me! I just want you to hold me in your arm tonight! (laughter)
Chris perkins: Have you ever had sex? (laughter)
Sam: No!
Taliesin: It was just hanging there!
Sam: Yes, I've had sex, Shale! I have a daughter.
Matt: He says this as a giant Bigby's Hand is just (impact sounds) at the side of a giant, black dragon. That brings us to the top of the initiative round. Percy, it's your turn. Oh my god.
Taliesin: Okay. How close am I to this dragon?
Matt: You are about ten feet from it right now.
Taliesin: I'm walking right the fuck up to it.
Matt: Okay, Percy. You walk right up to the dragon.
Taliesin: I'm pulling out the sword. And I'm going to fucking town, screaming like a little girl the entire time.
Marisha: Kill it! Advantage!
Taliesin: With advantage.
Marisha: All day! Advantage all day!
Laura: Kill that fucking dragon.
Taliesin: 26!
Matt: 26 hits.
Taliesin: All right, first damage. 23 points of damage.
Matt: 23 points of damage, all right.
Taliesin: For shot number one. Shot number two.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies. That's good!
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Marisha: Sorry, excitement.
Taliesin: Ten, 16, 16 times two is 32. 39, that's 39 points of damage. Number three! Oh, it gets worse. I'm going to die. Okay, I can do better than that. No, he can't. 22.
Matt: 22 just hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: That's 18 points of slashing damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Action surge, motherfucker!
Matt: Go for it.
Chris perkins: Going Ginsu on this dragon.
Matt: I know, seriously.
Taliesin: It is not an awesome hit, it's just a hit. I'm really excited. 18 points of damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Shot number two.
Sam: Oh my god.
Taliesin: That's a hit.
Laura: Natural 20?
Taliesin: Natural 20. This is to make up for all these fucking ones.
Laura: Why doesn't Percy just always attack melee?
Marisha: He's bad at it most of the time.
Taliesin: 47 points of damage. Final attack.
Sam: Wait, what?
Liam: How is this possible?
Marisha: Because he's a fighter, he gets three attacks per round.
Taliesin: Plus an action surge for a second attack set of three. So I'm basically going-- Yeah.
Marisha: It's like a John Wu film.
Taliesin: It's just a fucking John Wu attack. Oh my god, it hit. Just barely, because it was a one, otherwise. And that final hit is-- oh, that's good. 27 points of damage, and I'm done.
Matt: As you unload on Umbrasyl, the pent-up anger and frustration, you start slashing over and over again. You guys watch as the blade shines in the air in the presence of its naturally designed enemy. You see at the corners of his outfit little tufts of dark smoke beginning to appear. The scar of Orthax still shows when the fury builds within Percy. As each blow strikes, cutting away hunks and bits of dragon flesh and scale, Umbrasyl is heavily wounded and looking desperate. That ends your turn, I believe?
Laura: Oh my god, he's still alive?
Matt: You guys gave it time to rest.
Taliesin: Fuck it, bonus action, I'm putting on the mask and standing my ground. Fuck it.
Matt: Amazing what a dragon can do in two hours.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: All right. Vex.
Laura: Hi. Okay. I'm going to--
Matt: Actually, at the end of Percy's turn, he's going to use his third legendary action, knowing the source of the Faerie Fire and extremely frustrated by the fact that it has lent to a very difficult round, it turns towards the now water elemental quivering before it, and the tail comes down to smash towards your liquid form.
Marisha: (burbling)
Matt: Speaking of natural 20s.
Taliesin: It's okay.
Marisha: Come on, bitch. Come on.
Taliesin: You're fine.
Marisha: Totally fine. I'm an elemental for a reason.
Taliesin: You are totally fucking fine.
Matt: 32 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: Halved.
Matt: Halved, because of your elemental. Does water elemental have resistance to damage?
Marisha: Yeah, it has damage resistance against acid, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from non-magical weapons.
Matt: All right, so half that. So 32 made to 16. 16 points of bludgeoning damage. I need you to go ahead and roll a concentration check.
Marisha: What did you say?
Matt: Roll a concentration check. So roll a d20 and add your constitution modifier.
Taliesin: Even if it goes, it was worth it.
Marisha: Not bad, not bad. Hang on, sorry. Just my straight modifier, it's not a save? Okay, 18!
Matt: You maintain concentration. You needed to beat the 16.
Marisha: Whoa, daddy. All right.
Matt: Well, half the damage. No, it would've been ten, actually, because it's half the damage you receive.
Marisha: Half the damage I receive, so yeah, I'm good. I'm golden.
Matt: All right, cool. So Vex, what are you doing?
Laura: Oh, jeez. Who all is within five feet of it? Is everybody within five feet of it?
Matt: A lot of them are. Pretty much the whole party aside from Pike, you, and your brother.
Laura: Then I'm just going to attack it twice.
Taliesin: With advantage.
Sam: Oi, Matt. My Bigby's is concentration, so that cloud's gone, by the way.
Matt: Correct, thank you.
Laura: 19 plus 12 hits.
Sam: Did you shoot it in the back?
Matt: Yes, it does. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: As a bonus action?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Good memory on that one.
Laura: 19 on the first hit.
Matt: 19 damage? All right.
Laura: Then the second one hits as well, 17 plus 12.
Matt: Yep. Go ahead and roll damage for the second hit.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. All right. So, ending your turn, comes to the top of the round. Umbrasyl, now gripping into the stone, "I will not fall!" Suddenly, darkness begins to sweep into the area. In this area, a 15-foot radius all completely around Umbrasyl, all of you in this area, your vision goes dark.
Liam: Cancels out Faerie Fire and the golden butt?
Matt: Cancels out Faerie Fire. This is magical darkness.
Sam: It's not a spell, right?
Liam: For those of us on the outside, do we see a bubble of darkness where Key and the others--
Sam: A spell, Matt?
Matt: No, this is an effect of the lair. Actually, Faerie Fire would still affect it if you attacked it, per se, but it doesn't reveal its location currently within the darkness. However, it is technically larger than the darkness. Regardless, all of you guys that are in there, it would negate the advantage you would have from Faerie Fire. It would just be a central attack.
Marisha: So it wouldn't give us disadvantage, it would just be straight rolls?
Matt: A little bit of it's piercing through, because it is magic on magic. However, the rest of you see most of the party disappear into a giant sphere of magical darkness that fills the space.
Laura: So we on the outside, we can't use Faerie Fire? It's just a bubble of dark? Or do we see Umbrasyl peeking out?
Liam: He said he's bigger than the dark, so we see his head coming out.
Matt: You see the wings poking out the sides of it. You still see where he would be. Okay, so with that, Umbrasyl is going to go ahead and take a risk. He's going to lift his wings and head upward to move into an advantageous position.
Sam: No, it's not!
Marisha: Come on. Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm going to say, you leave when Burt Reynolds says you can fucking leave! And I will Bigby's Hand, and I will bring him back down, because I get a spell on his retreat.
Taliesin: I love watching him look at the phone.
Marisha: Consult the helix.
Matt: Unfortunately, you have to be grasping it or grappling it to attempt to--
Sam: No, I get a full spell action. It's my lore feature. I get to cast a brand new fucking spell when he lifts off.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: College of Lore. If he retreats, I get to cast a spell. This is the exact same thing that happened last time.
Matt: Trying to remember how this works. College of Lore. I don't know if it is. Because what you do is you grapple--
Sam: Oh, no, it's a War Caster feature.
Matt: Oh, War Caster! Thank you, that clarifies it. I was like, I don't see this in the College of Lore! You're confusing me! So as a War Caster, when a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an opportunity attack. So yeah, if you wanted to go ahead and attempt to grapple--
Sam: I will grapple him and pull him back down.
Matt: You can totally attempt that. Bigby, go ahead and make a strength athletics check to beat a dragon's strength. Bigby is just slightly under the strength of the dragon, so let's see. It's a roll-off.
Sam: It's a roll-off! Oh my god. This is a critical roll. That's a two.
Matt: It was a 19 on my end. Natural 19. As Bigby's Hand reaches forward, the angry, wounded, frustrated, furious Umbrasyl just kicks the hand away, pulling up.
Taliesin: Do we get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Attack of opportunity from you, you, you, and you.
Marisha: Down, bitch, down!
Ashley: And the Spiritual Weapon, right? And the Spiritual Weapon?
Matt: No, it does not get attacks of opportunity.
Marisha: Without advantage, even though he's retreating?
Matt: Without advantage, because of the magical darkness that has surrounded you guys.
Marisha: Even though he's retreating in Faerie Fire? That doesn't double it?
Matt: The darkness would give you disadvantage, the Faerie Fire negates that. I'm letting you do this.
Marisha: Okay. Letting you do this! Be thankful of what you have! 22 exactly.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: 20.
Chris perkins: My staff bounces right off.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Travis: 23.
Matt: All right, so Grog and Keyleth both get a hit in. Go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Shit. Balls. Low. Shit. Eight damage from the elemental.
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20, all right.
Travis: 25. Plus the necrotic.
Matt: Good to know.
Marisha: And we decided I don't get my fire hands when I'm a water elemental?
Matt: Because that's bullshit.
Marisha: Yeah, all right.
Taliesin: That would just be steam.
Matt: So as you swing out, you arc, and the axe strikes across the back of Umbrasyl's hide. You slam with your water elemental form. The flight is staggered, and barely lands on his feet. Umbrasyl, "I will take you all down!" Unleashes.
Marisha: Here it comes.
Matt: I need a dexterity saving throw from Shale, Percy, Keyleth, and Scanlan.
Laura: Oh, it's that whole table!
Sam: Seven!
Chris perkins: 24.
Marisha: 12.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: All right. Shale actually succeeded on that one. DC 23.
Marisha: DC 23!
Matt: So you take half damage on that one. That's going to be, doing the dice rolls here. So that's 62 points of acid damage down to 31 to Shale, and 31 to you because you're resistant. So 62 points of acid damage to both of you guys.
Sam: My armor, does that do anything?
Matt: Your armor takes it by half, so you would take 31.
Taliesin: 62? Okay.
Chris perkins: Cursed lizard, we're going to give all your treasure to the poor!
Matt: And with that, it takes the rest of its action to move further back at its 80 foot flight, and it's going to end up right about there.
Sam: It's too big to fit in its own house.
Matt: I know! Leaving the Spiritual Weapon there. All right, that's going to end its turn. That now brings it to Vax.
Liam: The twins still have advantage because it's got the Faerie Fire on it, right? You said everyone in it?
Matt: Oh, you need to make a concentration check, by the way, from the damage you just took.
Marisha: Did he get out of the darkness?
Matt: He did.
Marisha: Ooh, ouch, not good at all. What am I making, just a constitution check?
Matt: Add your constitution modifier.
Marisha: I don't think it's going to be enough. Eight.
Matt: The Faerie Fire fades as the acid consumes you, no longer affected by it.
Marisha: Shit.
Matt: All right. Vax, it's your turn. To answer your question, no.
Liam: Nobody's near it anymore, right?
Matt: Nope.
Liam: Okay. I would like to scrabble up behind it, as close to its treasure pile as I can get.
Matt: Okay, that would be about there.
Liam: And I'm going to throw. Shit. No, cancel that. I'd like to run up its tail.
Matt: Okay. You go rushing, clambering onto the back of its tail. It swoops around and sees you doing so, but you're already quick and on it. What are you going to do?
Liam: I'm going to hold my action until somebody gets up on this motherfucker, and as soon as somebody gets close and catches his attention I'm going to stab into it.
Matt: Okay. Good to know. All right, that takes the end of Vax's turn. Shale, you're up.
Chris perkins: I stride up to the dragon and smack it on the nose.
Travis: Atta girl, Shale!
Matt: Speed of 20 feet, you said?
Chris perkins: Yeah.
Matt: You can't quite get to it, unfortunately. That's about as far as you can move this turn. You can dash if you want to, but even so, you still can't quite get to it.
Chris perkins: All right then. I will use all my action to get as close to it as I can.
Matt: Okay, there we go. All right! Ending Shale's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. I didn't realize I was up so quickly. All right.
Chris perkins: Although, actually, I have action surge.
Matt: You do, actually.
Chris perkins: So I will then whack him on the nose.
Matt: That's true.
Marisha: Fuck yes.
Chris perkins: All right, so that's going to be--
Taliesin: I have 13 hit points.
Sam: 13? I thought that said 93.
Taliesin: I count up.
Chris perkins: 22.
Matt: 22, that just barely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Chris perkins: So I whack it for nine.
Matt: Nine points of damage, got it.
Liam: I'm above it. Do I get advantage for that?
Matt: Technically, because you are behind, you are flanking it, so as we'll use the flanking rules for this, you do have advantage on the attack.
Liam: Okay, so, good. 29.
Matt: 29 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24, all righty.
Liam: And is the bonus action gone because of holding the action?
Matt: Correct, yeah, you just get the one action to hold.
Liam: Add one point to that. It was the keen dagger.
Matt: So as part of your action surge, you get two more attacks.
Liam: I didn't add the damage! Add eight to that. Not one, add eight to that. Sorry.
Sam: Add seven more. Then add three.
Chris perkins: Nope, and nope.
Sam: You have inspiration!
Chris perkins: I used it already.
Sam: Goddamn it!
Chris perkins: But thank you, it was very helpful.
Sam: You're useless!
Chris perkins: A fickle lover.
Matt: The one hit, it snorts in reaction to it. As it pulls back, you swing twice more, pretty sure the head was in the same place it was going to be, but unfortunately, meet air. Curse your sight!
Chris perkins: He had a bit of an itch on his back, that's what it was.
Matt: Caught the attention. All right, that brings us to Pike. What are you doing?
Ashley: I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing over to everybody over there. So, Keyleth, Percy, Scanlan, Shale.
Marisha: Awesome. I'm into this.
Chris perkins: I'm sort of right under the dragon. I'm actually quite far.
Ashley: Yeah, she's gone. Who's that down there? That's you, Percy, right?
Taliesin: Trinket.
Matt: What level is Prayer of Healing?
Ashley: I'm going to do it at fifth level. It's a second level, but I'm going to do it at fifth level.
Matt: Within 30 feet of you, so five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.
Sam: You can heal my hand.
Liam: You could also run closer and do it.
Ashley: Okay. Yeah, I'll run closer. And I'll run around, not into the pool of acid death.
Matt: That's as close as you can get right now.
Sam: Is that close?
Liam: It's close enough for Scanlan.
Matt: It's enough for Scanlan and Keyleth.
Sam: Don't do it.
Marisha: Percy needs it.
Ashley: Percy needs it?
Matt: Percy's not in range.
Ashley: Fuck. Can I go the other way around?
Sam: You can go through the acid.
Taliesin: No.
Travis: It was only 12 points of damage.
Ashley: I don't have a lot left. All right, then.
Taliesin: It's okay.
Liam: Do what you can.
Ashley: Okay. Fuck. Can I stay where I was at, then?
Matt: You can. Stay right there.
Ashley: Okay. Sorry, I'm going to not do that. I'm going to Guiding Bolt then.
Matt: Okay. You can just barely make out the position of where Umbrasyl is. You can go ahead and make the attack, but it's going to get cover bonus to the range.
Ashley: Can I peek out? Can I move out?
Matt: You can move here if you want to, and it'll help a little bit. It'll only give it a minor bonus. Go ahead and make your attack.
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: Go ahead and make your spell attack. Is this basic level Guiding Bolt?
Ashley: Basic level Guiding Bolt.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Nope. Doesn't hit.
Matt: You try and reach around and as it's moving its wings about, you manage to strike the stone just blocking half of its form. It splashes with energy and dissipates with no effect, unfortunately.
Ashley: All right. Can I tuck back in?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: And I'm going to move the Spiritual Weapon with my bonus attack, or can I not do that?
Matt: You can do that, yeah. 20 feet? To there.
Ashley: Okay. That's it. That's what I can do.
Matt: Is that as far as you can move it? Spiritual Weapon can move, I believe it's 20 feet. Yeah, that's as far as you can get it.
Ashley: No, 60 feet!
Matt: The range of the spell is 60 feet, but as a bonus action, you can move it 20 feet and repeat the attack.
Ashley: Oh.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I'm up? No shit. Wow. Okay. It's really far away though now, yeah?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Way more than 30 feet, right?
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: What is he? How far away is he from me?
Matt: You're not sure.
Liam: He's about 40 or 50 feet or something.
Marisha: Yeah. You're holding your action for someone to get up close.
Laura: He already did it.
Marisha: Oh, you already did it. Yeah, I guess I'm going to dash and see if I can get to him.
Matt: Okay, what's your movement as a water elemental?
Marisha: 30 feet.
Matt: 30 feet. 60, you're so close. Fucking dragon wings. There you go, you're so close. We'll say you're there, that's fine. That ends your turn, Keyleth?
Marisha: I guess so.
Matt: All right. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to stride over to Bigby's Hand, and can I take out a level-- It's not level two, what do you call it? Not superior, but the middle one.
Sam: Moderate?
Travis: Can I take a moderate healing potion?
Matt: There's healing and then greater healing, so I imagine it would probably be greater healing.
Travis: Can I take the greater healing potion and chuck it to Percy?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Just a toss while standing at Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to catch the tossed potion at that distance.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Matt: You don't even look.
Travis: And I will hold my attack.
Matt: You can keep moving if you want.
Travis: I want to stay right by Bigby's Hand. I'll hold my attack until Bigby's Hand twitches.
Matt: All right. Finishing Grog's turn, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I will inspire Grog with a little ditty that I like to call, Who Let the Grogs Out?
All: Who? Who who who who?
Sam: Who let the Grogs out?
All: Who? Who who who who?
Matt: I'm conflicted in giving that inspiration. Take it, it's fine.
Sam: I can try a different one, if you'd like.
Matt: No, it's perfect.
Sam: And I will pick him up, with his blessing.
Travis: Please.
Sam: And throw him at the dragon.
Matt: Throw?
Sam: Or, you know, send him.
Matt: Okay, so Bigby's Hand will move with you 60 feet.
Sam: You want to go up to his head?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: All right, yeah. He's going up top.
Matt: Okay. We'll go ahead and use some of the platforms today.
Laura: Yeah! Cut his horns off!
Liam: Don't land on me.
Ashley: Kill him!
Laura: Cut his wings off!
Ashley: Tear his head off!
Laura: Jump off those head things!
Taliesin: We have done a lot of damage to this thing.
Matt: Problem with leaving it to heal, man.
Sam: He's only got 400 hit points left.
Laura: He's looking rough.
Matt: Should be more like there, we'll say.
Sam: Release the hounds.
Travis: Can I make two reckless attacks?
Matt: You may.
Laura: Reckless?
Travis: Yes, reckless. I'll use the inspiration die. That's a ten, so that's a 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Sam: Yeah! That helped.
Travis: 23.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26, got it. All right, second attack.
Travis: 24.
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: 24.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: Thank you. 29. I'm not used to that.
Matt: All right. As Bigby's Hand lifts you up, you reach out and swing with the axe, one hit, a second hit, both streaking across the face, the second one actually cutting through one of the eyes. The eye bursts against the blade of bloodaxe, and you can see now the fluids and material that once were contained within are now spilling down the side of Umbrasyl's face.
Travis: Ain't you pretty?
Matt: All right, Scanlan.
Sam: What, me?
Matt: That was your bonus action.
Sam: Oh! Well, okay. I didn't know that. I will try something else then. I will send-- shit. I will send my Lightning Bolt. Can I see any part of him that's not inhabited by one of my allies?
Matt: I'd say there's an arc you could probably hit, yeah.
Sam: Right in the heart?
Matt: Sure. The heart region of the dragon.
Sam: I'm going to shoot him right through the heart with lightning.
Matt: All right. That is a dexterity 21 save, so I'm pretty sure it's halved.
Sam: Yeah, that saves.
Matt: Go ahead and roll 8d6, half damage.
Liam: Shot through the heart!
Sam: I don't know that song, I don't know what that is. I don't know that song. 24, so just 12.
Matt: 12 points of lightning damage. All right. The bolt of lightning bursts through the body. All righty. That comes to the top of the round. At the end of Scanlan's turn, it's going to use a legendary action to strike down, with the tail, onto Vax behind, as you are already in that vicinity.
Liam: Dex save?
Matt: No, this is instead going to be a 26 to hit.
Liam: Yeah, that-- oh, displacer cloak. Did you do that at disadvantage?
Matt: That is instead a 24 to hit.
Liam: That does hit. I'll use Uncanny Dodge, though.
Matt: All right. So what would be 18 damage, you take nine instead from the tail. Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to take three shots from where I'm at. First, I'm going to use my bonus action to chug down that potion I just got. What's the superior worth?
Sam: Greater.
Matt: It's a greater, yes. 4d4 plus four.
Taliesin: 4d4 plus four. Where are my d4s at? I'll just do this four times. 13 points up, so that's a little bit better. All right, I'm going to take shot number one. I'm going to do a called shot to the face. I'm going to hit his other eye. Come on. Natural 20.
Sam: I feel like we need to retire the dice.
Taliesin: Fuck no! No, I love this die.
Marisha: You witnessed it!
Chris perkins: Yeah!
Marisha: You're a third party, it's good.
Travis: Have you and Wheaton ever touched?
Taliesin: Yeah, and I had a really bad day afterward. Let me tell you. That didn't turn out too well. That's just 16 points of damage, and I don't think I get anything bonus for this, he has to make a constitution saving throw.
Chris perkins: Eyeball saving throw.
Taliesin: Or he's going to have disadvantage on all of his attacks for the next turn.
Matt: Okay, that is nine plus 14, 23.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, he's fine.
Matt: Dragons.
Taliesin: I know. It was worth a shot. I'm going to take another shot. Fuck it, I'm just going to go for a sharpshooter, to try and do a little bit more damage to this, and I'm going to burn another grit and get advantage on it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So advantage sharpshooter. And that's a good thing, because that was terrible. And that was also terrible. So I miss.
Matt: All right, second shot. The first one (boom) slams and blasts near the ocular socket of Umbrasyl, shattering the bone, but not actually damaging the eye. The second shot manages to go through the wing, but unfortunately, the area was already damaged, and it's minimal in the effect on the dragon. Third strike?
Taliesin: Yeah, third strike. Here we go. Actually, you know what, I'm going to go for advantage. I'm going to go for sharpshooter advantage one more time, just for shits and giggles. Jesus. Do I call it?
Matt: It fell to the table.
Taliesin: So, yeah, I miss.
Matt: Two other shots, unfortunately, (bang).
Taliesin: I'm going to hide. I'm going to pull top right, and go up. I'm going up and I'm getting the fuck back there, as far back as I can get.
Matt: Okay. End of Percy's turn, going to use another legendary action to slam with the tail once again towards you, Vax. This is going to be--
Liam: This is in the same round, so there's no more disadvantage.
Matt: Correct. 25?
Liam: Sure. And do I blow Uncanny Dodge now?
Matt: You only get one reaction, so yeah. That's going to be 22 points of bludgeoning damage. Whack! The tail comes down and slams into you, putting you face-first into the stone. You can feel the blood run from your nose from the impact as the tail picks back up again. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to attack him a couple times. How about that? No advantage anymore, though, huh?
Marisha: No, it failed.
Laura: 18 on the first one doesn't hit.
Matt: Arrow just splinters across the dragon's hide.
Laura: That first one was way better, I should've kept it!
Matt: What was the second one?
Laura: The second one was 16.
Matt: 16, the second arrow strikes the side of Umbrasyl's face. Unfortunately, once again, the wood shaft streaks across, broken and destroyed by the impact. That ends your turn.
Laura: No, I still have a bonus action, so I'm going to hide with my bonus action.
Matt: Okay, you can do that, roll stealth. Did you add sneak attack? Oh, no, because nothing hit. Sorry.
Laura: Really?
Matt: Sorry, I was trying to be mindful.
Laura: Did you really just do that?
Matt: Trying to help. Failing miserably, but trying.
Laura: Do I still have Pass Without Trace?
Matt: No. Hunter's Mark got rid of that.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Top of the round. Magical darkness fills this entire sphere once more, encapsulating Grog, Vax, and everybody else in the area of the dragon. Vision is taken. You are all considered blind and have disadvantage on any attack rolls.
Laura: Who all?
Matt: Dragon does not seem to be--
Liam: And is it we're blinded, or we're blind where we are?
Matt: Blind where you are.
Travis: Dragon does not seem to be--?
Matt: Affected by it.
Laura: I'm not affected by that, though, because I'm outside of the bubble?
Matt: Correct, yes. Actually, let me see something.
Travis: That dumb grin.
Matt: With a five. Yep.
Marisha: Breath recharged.
Matt: Umbrasyl is going to turn up towards you, Grog. The head peeks out of the darkness for a second, right before it fills your space, and it just says, "I will finish this." You hear a familiar sound of gurgling, and then (liquid spray) out another time. This is going to go for everything in that vicinity. That's going to be Keyleth, Shale, Grog, Trinket, and Percy.
Taliesin: Did I not get cover?
Matt: You couldn't move that far, unfortunately. That's as far as you could go with your movement.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: So I need a dexterity saving throw from all of you guys.
Marisha: Fuck.
Taliesin: Blowing my last reroll. That's better.
Marisha: It's like a 23 save, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Fuck no. I mean, I rolled good, but--
Marisha: But it doesn't matter.
Travis: 18.
Chris perkins: Ten.
Marisha: Six.
Taliesin: That's 20.
Matt: And Trinket? Oh.
Sam: I guess I should do a Cutting Words, just to help a little bit.
Matt: What's the range on Cutting Words, unfortunately?
Sam: Probably 60, 30? Is he further than that? Damn it.
Matt: Unfortunately. The distance of the bard. Just to make sure. 60 feet, yeah. So that's 66 points of acid damage to Grog, Shale, halved to you, and 66 to Percy.
Laura: Trinket's unconscious.
Matt: Trinket is unconscious and dissolving.
Taliesin: I'm unconscious.
Matt: Percy is unconscious and dissolving. Grog?
Travis: I'm good.
Matt: You're good. Hit points.
Travis: I have a question. Because he attacked me, do I get my retaliation attack on him?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Marisha: Kill him, motherfucker! Kill him!
Matt: Shale, what are you at?
Chris perkins: This will depend on this roll. I've got Stone's Endurance, so I'm going to try to use my reaction to reduce the damage, and I reduce it by enough to keep me up.
Matt: Fantastic! She's got grit! She's got perseverance!
Sam: So sexy!
Chris perkins: I'm at two hit points.
Matt: All right, Grog, go for it. Not with advantage.
Travis: It's not reckless?
Matt: The reckless is for your actual attack round.
Travis: The first one was an 18.
Matt: I'm pretty sure it is. Let me double check. Just so the internet doesn't yell at me. It's going to yell at me anyway, it always yells at me.
Taliesin: I believe in you.
Travis: It's a 27, so.
Marisha: This fucker's got to be close to death, right?
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: During this turn, not round, so yeah.
Travis: That was a 27 for the first one.
Matt: 27 was the hit? That hits. Roll damage.
Travis: 18.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: Thank you. 22.
Matt: 22. How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Did the fucking necrotic do it? (screaming)
Sam: Oh, god.
Matt: So. Held aloft by Bigby's Hand, acid sprayed in your face, two of your friends on the ground, unconscious and dissolving, in the center of the dragon's lair, Grog Strongjaw, how do you want to do this?
Travis: I rear back with the bloodaxe and I swing for the hinge right where his upper and lower jaw meet, and I'd like to cleave up under his skull into his brain.
Matt: As you lunge forward, the darkness fills you, but the feral instinct that you've grown up with is enough to know the source of that pain, the source of that acid, is also the source of victory. And as you swing wide, the jaw, still extended from the blast of acid, you push through it, as it's spraying into you, and the sheer force of your blade hits the edge of the jaw, and you push, and you hear from the back of the throat, as the acid is projected, the gurgle of horrible, shrieking pain. (groan) The stream stops as the blade goes towards the base of the skull, pushing forward and upward. You divide the actual mouth of Umbrasyl like that. The darkness (whoosh) flicks out, as you guys watch Grog descending, putting your foot now onto the front of the dragon's neck, you stand up, getting hold onto where the wound is there, still living, the one working eye flitting about wildly, you reach up and grab the edge of the nose, bring the axe up with the other hand, and slam again, and again, and as you do, the eye rolls back. The whole body begins to fall limp as it crumples backward. Vax, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, I am very unconscious.
Ashley: You'll be okay. I've got you.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay, you dodge out of the way as the dragon plummets to the ground. (heavy impact) What was Trinket's maximum hit points?
Laura: It was 60.
Matt: Let me check something here.
Laura: But he was at 53 when he got hit.
Matt: The remaining damage. Yeah, you're fine.
Travis: Night saved.
Matt: Umbrasyl's body hits the ground, the two arms reach up, and the body still continues to pull itself backwards. You pull out of the way. The head lolls around, the jaw now grossly, cartoonishly open, giving out these horrible choking sounds, as the blood and bile and acid all mingle. It tries to talk. The bubbles continue coming forward before it stumbles, the arms sprawled out, its head falls limp to the side as the eye twitches and then falls still.
Ashley: I run over to Percy.
Laura: I run over to Trinket.
Marisha: I drop my water elemental form.
Ashley: I touch Percy and I cast Heal on him.
Marisha: Nice.
Laura: I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket.
Matt: As you stand there, Shale, watching the dragon fall as Grog Strongjaw, the once runt of the Herd of Storms, slams the blade over and over again in the dragon's head, a little part of you is a little jealous, and another part proud, and a little sad that this was not the time for you to lose your life in battle against a mighty dragon.
Ashley: Oh, Shale.
Liam: Can you believe it?
Sam: Shale jumps into acid.
Liam: Just walks in.
Chris perkins: Dissolves.
Matt: (sizzle) I can make that joke in two weeks! As you go and bring Trinket around for a second, using the last bit of the magic that's been afforded to you as a ranger, Trinket comes to. (bear grunt) A lot of the fur has been singed off, and spotted flesh with acid burn, but is conscious and alive, and weak, Trinket leans forward as you're cradling his head and licks the side of your face and tucks his nose into the side of your shoulder.
Laura: You were so brave in here!
Matt: (bear grunt) You go ahead and help Percy get off the ground. You come to consciousness again and you see Pike's hand touching yours as she lifts you. Suddenly, a surge of invigoration hits your body, and you find yourself feeling a lot better than you did a few moments ago.
Taliesin: Yeah, what am I at?
Ashley: 70 hit points.
Laura: That's major.
Matt: Heal, man. Clerics don't fuck around.
Ashley: I saved it just in case.
Laura: Holy shit, Grog!
Marisha: Holy shit, Grog!
Ashley: Grog! I run over to Grog and I jump up on his leg, I'm going to sit on his foot.
Travis: Monstah!
Ashley: Yeah, monstah!
Chris perkins: I will remove my dragon tooth necklace and pass it off to Grog.
Travis: No, Shale.
Chris perkins: You must take this. You've got many more battles left in you. This is going to serve you better than it ever served me. And just so you know, I don't know what the Herd would do, but if you ever go into battle again against other dragons, you know who to call. I'll be ready.
Travis: Yeah. The wielder of the magic stick of nose-whappiness. I will wear this with honor.
Chris perkins: All right. So whenever you, by the way, whenever you spend hit dice to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points restored.
Travis: With the necklace?
Chris perkins: Yes.
Travis: Oh, snap!
Ashley: You what?
Chris perkins: Double your hit points you restore.
Travis: I thought it was bullshit, but it's not! Dope!
Liam: You finally have some hit points.
Laura: You know, if you seek another dragon to kill, you might meet us in Whitestone. We're forming an army there.
Chris perkins: I just might.
Marisha: Keyleth drops elemental form and goes over to Vax and grabs him by the face.
Liam: You'd have to lean over for that.
Sam: He's a little boy!
Laura: It's like kissing a child.
Chris perkins: He's like a little voodoo doll of Vax.
Liam: I'm not pygmied or anything, I'm like a doll.
Laura: Keep it going, Keyleth. Just mug down with him.
Liam: Maybe this should wait till later?
Marisha: I tap him on the face, and say  So glad you're not dead. And I walk away.
Liam: I'm going to shake that off, and then I'm going to do a once around the entire chamber and look around for any traps I can find, especially around that pile up top, but also, I don't know that they'll be here, but see if there's anything like what we saw in Krieg's cave with the crystals in the wall. Little peeky stones.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Can I look for those, too, since dragons?
Liam: 22.
Laura: Oh, he probably doesn't need my help. I get advantage on all dragon things.
Matt: You do.
Laura: It doesn't matter. I rolled shit, twice. 12.
Matt: 12, okay. You guys spend the better part of the next 15 or so minutes glancing around and trying to find any sign of these strange obsidian spheres that were previously in the lair of Krieg, or Brimscythe. After coasting through the crates and barrels, gold piles, the various artifacts and trinkets and things that are strewn about this back corner, no sign of anything like that.
Liam: What about weaponry in that pile of shit?
Laura: What about all the stuff in that pile of shit?
Travis: You want to rage loot?
Matt: There's a lot of things in there.
Liam: I was first on the pile. Are there any weapons in there?
Matt: There are weapons. There are two glaives, polearm glaives. There appear to be a number of pieces of ornamental armor, very beautiful, made of gold and platinum, that were either used for ceremonial reasons or just adorning some sort of popular hall.
Marisha: Keyleth walks over and pulls out her Hunk of Quall.
Sam: Yeah, Quall it up.
Marisha: I'm going to Quall it up all over top of the gold, see if anything lights up with my Wi-Fi detector. Since that's what I feel like it is.
Matt: Strangely enough, no. Nothing seems to glow in the vicinity of the Hunk of Quall.
Liam: And no other blades?
Matt: There are two glaives. Pulling the list up here. Going through the whole hoard, because it is 11:20, we may pick up the actual looting element at the beginning of next session. We'll be here for a while if you want to do that.
Laura: I like the sound of that.
Marisha: We have to go back and get Fassbender.
Laura: Yeah, we're totally going to go back. We're going to return a lot of this gold to Whiterun. Westruun. All the towns.
Sam: Well, all the gold that we can definitely prove came from Westruun, we'll bring back.
Laura: I agree.
Sam: With Westruun markings.
Laura: All the other gold that's just sitting around, I mean, we should probably just take to help the battles.
Travis: Plus it would be nice to give Shale some gold to take back to the Herd.
Sam: Who?
Travis: Shale.
Sam: The Herd? I thought the Herd's-- Okay.
Travis: There was a great remnant. The Herd will live again, and with Shale's wisdom.
Marisha: There were still a few members of the Herd still alive. A good half dozen.
Travis: Zanror's baby mama is still preggo.
Marisha: Yeah, exactly.
Liam: It's also very lean times in Westruun. Most of this gold should go back to Westruun.
Laura: Most of it.
Marisha: Did we contribute any of our own gold into this pile?
Liam: That's back in Westruun.
Chris perkins: I can return with the remnants of the Herd and gather up whatever you don't take.
Laura: And bring it back to Westruun.
Sam: We'll divvy it up later.
Marisha: Let's divvy it up.
Liam: If we take most of the gold that came from Westruun, we're a big pack of assholes.
Laura: I said we weren't going to! We're going to take it back to Westruun.
Sam: You're a tiny pack of assholes right now.
Marisha: Is he still tiny? He's still tiny.
Laura: Three hours.
Liam: Probably another two hours.
Laura: It's only been an hour? No.
Matt: You have, probably another 20, 30 minutes or so before it fades.
Marisha: We need Fassbender.
Travis: Keyleth, you're going to butcher this dragon, right?
Marisha: Yes. 100 percent. I start going to town on it.
Laura: Because this is going to be worth a lot of fucking money.
Marisha: Yeah. Percy, do you have any extra vials? Empty vials for blood?
Laura: We should get some of the blood and put it in the Bag of Colding.
Marisha: Hey, Percy! So glad you're alive and not burning in acid. Do you have any extra vials?
Taliesin: Do I?
Matt: Checking in your various pieces of equipment you have on you, as opposed to what you have stored elsewhere, you had a few vials. They are a little jangly when you reach for them, and you realize they've been crushed.
Taliesin: We have some empty potion bottles.
Liam: I hand mine over from the one I gave Vex.
Taliesin: The one I used as well.
Matt: Go ahead and make a nature check.
Marisha: I'll take that 16 for a 27. Nature check, yeah? 27.
Matt: All right. So as you guys are gathering the elements of this dragon's hoard, gathering the equipment, the art pieces, the relics, all things that were part of this-- and it is, especially since you know, as far as dragon hoards go, especially for an ancient dragon, it isn't huge. And with the recent moving in, you get the idea that this dragon's true hoard probably exists elsewhere. This was either a temporary lair, or was intended to be the new lair, and the process of transitioning hadn't quite begun. Most of the gold here seems to have been what was given to Umbrasyl by the Herd once they had taken over Westruun.
Liam: Maybe he has to give it to Thordak in a dragon pyramid scheme.
Laura: We don't find any of those glyphs like there were in--
Taliesin: We already looked for those.
Laura: Not the circles, I meant the transportation glyph that we beamed into his--
Matt: That you saw in Krieg's lair? No. You do know, from having one made by Allura within your keep before, that they take quite some time to ingrain. Dragon's only really had over a week or so. So, gathering up the materials, the remnants of that hoard, you guys descend down the mountain if you wish, or is there anything else you wish to accomplish within the actual lair?
Marisha: I want to harvest some scales, some blood, and some teeth.
Matt: Right, based on the roll you made. So we have two empty vials that you managed to acquire.
Marisha: Plus he had three in his Bag of Holding.
Liam: Can I help her out?
Matt: Yeah. It's difficult because, with the nature of Umbrasyl's death, as well as being a creature that is naturally caustic and acidic in a large portion of its body, there was a mixing of a lot of the blood that has caused it to become impure while vialing it, so you get three vials of the blood that are still pure and viable. Everything else seems to dissolve through the glass upon contact.
Laura: I can put it in the Bag of Colding, and then it'll keep it.
Taliesin: I can assist with any of the cutting, because I've got the fuck-all sword.
Marisha: I hand the three vials of blood to Vex to put in the Bag of Colding.
Matt: Many dragon's teeth were sundered in the ravaging of Umbrasyl at Grog's furious storm of axe blade strikes. However, you do manage to harvest from the body, unscathed, 14 ancient black dragon teeth.
Marisha: We should make some sweet necklaces. Any scales?
Matt: Quite a lot of scales here, yes. It's going to take you a long time to harvest what you can off this body. A lot of the areas have been damaged from the various wounds and such. How much time do you want to spend to harvest scales?
Liam: Do you think we should just camp here for the night?
Taliesin: We could just camp here for the night.
Laura: As long as the other dragons don't realize that we've just done this. Would I know if they would know?
Matt: You have no idea.
Laura: I don't know if it's actually safe to just hang out in this dragon's lair.
Taliesin: You know what we can do, is we can make the magic mansion in that cave off to the side, in the very back of it.
Laura: That's a wonderful idea.
Ashley: And that magic trap, we didn't set it off.
Taliesin: We haven't sprung the magic trap, either, so that's just none the wiser.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: All right. I'll spend as much time then, I'll stay up as long as I can throughout the night. If I hear any disturbances I'll come back to the mansion.
Taliesin: I'll help.
Chris perkins: Once we get to the mansion, Shale will bid the group farewell and head down to Westruun to let the rest of the Herd know what's happened, about the great triumph of the bearded king.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: As you come down and--
Chris perkins: I'm killed by an owlbear.
Matt: Ravaged and eaten horribly in the Bramblewood, never to be seen again!
Chris perkins: Nobody hears the tale of the bearded king!
Travis: Son of a bitch!
Taliesin: Forever, the Herd will just say, Grog, that asshole.
Marisha: Such a dick.
Matt: No, you come down and as you speak with the remnants of the Herd of Storms, many of which, a number of them did survive the battle, though scarred horribly, and many did lose their life in the battle with Umbrasyl. Zanror, Worra, recovering all right. However, the number's now thinned down to a simple 12 members of the Herd. As you speak with Zanror, he looks to you and says, "Shale. You live."
Chris perkins: Obviously.
Matt: "Have you word of the mountain? The dragon?"
Chris perkins: I toss one of its teeth at him. He will trouble us no more. He is a bygone.
Matt: "Good. Good." He takes the tooth and gives it to Worra. "Well."
Chris perkins: It's the work of those adventurers.
Matt: "Vox Machina, they call themselves."
Chris perkins: They are truly great.
Matt: "Good. We need greatness in this world. We--"
Chris perkins: Don't be so glum, you old fool.
Matt: He grins to himself.
Chris perkins: This is a day of glory. A great battle has been won.
Matt: "It is. But there's been a lot of cost in it, too."
Chris perkins: There's always cost. We will all die, it just depends on how. We died fighting a dragon, and we lived fighting a dragon. What more do you want? That's the smile I want to see.
Matt: "I'm glad you're back, Shale. Your wisdom stays strong."
Chris perkins: Well, now that Kevdak's out of the way, maybe people will listen to what I have to say for a change.
Matt: "We've been talking here. I think the Herd of Storms died in battle with the dragon. There's not many of us left."
Chris perkins: But there are other herds.
Matt: "There are. And while we lost the Rivermaw, I think maybe it's time we went and joined them."
Chris perkins: I like that idea.
Matt: "They're damper lands. Better for raising children. Take a break from all this warring and go back to a simple life. Will you come with us, Shale?"
Chris perkins: Of course.
Matt: "Good. We'll set out tomorrow. At dawn, we plan."
Sam: He's learned!
Matt: You guys set up for the evening, resting your sore, bruised bodies, smelling the ruin of the black dragon as you prepare for an evening's rest, well-earned. We will close this evening's session. Well fought, guys!
Travis: Holy shit.
Marisha: We didn't die!
Liam: Scanlan, is there a hot springs in this mansion?
Sam: There can be whatever you want.
Liam: We need to bathe, soak. We need a good soak to get the stink off.
Matt: It's amazing. You imagine why he didn't mention it before, but Scanlan does indeed have a hot spring in his magnificent mansion.
Travis: It's amazing!
Matt: No, it's magnificent. Guys, a big thank you and round of applause for Chris Perkins!
Chris perkins: Thanks for having me! It's a great honor to be here. Thank you.
Matt: All right, well. We'll pick this back up again next week on Thursday to see what the next adventure holds for Vox Machina now that one of the four Conclave remaining have fallen! I can tell you with the death of one dragon, I doubt the others, upon hearing of it, will be anywhere near as careless as Umbrasyl was. But there are more Vestiges to find, more allies to acquire. Who knows what other dangers lie in the realms of Tal'Dorei and beyond, outside of the Conclave's threat? We shall see in the weeks to come. Guys, thank you so much for staying up with us tonight. Rest well, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week. [end of captions]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: (as Victor) Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, our Halloween edition. Where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Hi. Tonight we will astound you with spooky tales. I don't know what's going to happen as we are just going to continue the game that we normally play. Welcome, I'm Matthew Mercer, dungeon master. (laughter)
Matt: Those who don't recognise my costume, you're really confused, especially if this is your first time tuning in. Sorry. (normal voice) I am not dungeon mastering like that for the rest of the evening because I will have to run into traffic after an hour. (cheering)
Matt: Guys, I want to give a quick thank you to Amazon for delaying all my orders, making me put my costume together last minute out of shit I found at Home Depot. So, thanks, Amazon. It's fantastic, I appreciate it. All right, anyway. I guess we should go through everyone else's to see the magnificent costumes around us. Let's go and start over here with our fantastic--
Sam: I am Hotis! The rakshasa. And I cannot speak with my mouth hole. (growls)
Taliesin: I have Clarota, but the mask is currently on its way here because I didn't have nearly enough coffee. So on the break there will be a giant squiddy mask that is terrible, just terrible. It's the worst thing.
Marisha: Half Clarota! I am Doctor Anna Ripley, from Wildemount.
Travis: You suck, Ripley!
Marisha: This is very heavy. This is a bludgeoning weapon, it is not a piercing weapon. It is a bludgeoning weapon. Right hand to the Briarwoods. And uber Percy fangirl. That's me. Cheers.
Laura: Ooh! Nice, nice!
Matt: All right, Liam.
Liam: Hi, Hi. I am Tyriok. I make maps.
Sam: Why are you having trouble picking that up?
Liam: Oh, well. I was turned to stone recently and I don't have two arms anymore. I have one. I can still roll dice though and I have maps and I have a compass and I am the least dangerous person at the tables. I'm not level one in anything, really, except maps. I'm level 15 in maps. I'm just happy to be here and be alive. Mostly.
Laura: We've been opening doors for him all night.
Matt: Thank you, Liam. That's awesome. Laura!
Laura: I'm Lady Briarwood. Here with the man I broke the world for.
Travis: You broke it for me, baby.
Laura: That's right. You should say who you are.
Travis: Oh right. I'm Lord Briarwood.
Laura: Nice!
Travis: Yeah. Undead. Betrothed.
Laura: That's right. More than betrothed.
Liam: Do you know, people who are in love high five?
Travis: We be representing the dead motherfuckers in this game.
Laura: I'm not dead.
Travis: Are you not?
Laura: No, man.
Liam: Just inside.
Laura: Just inside.
Marisha: Actually, me and Travis are the only dead ones.
Laura: I guess. Well, I am dead. No, I am dead.
Liam: Currently dead, but you weren't undead.
Laura: Exactly. I misunderstood.
Matt: You're both dead. You're destroyed. You're dead. You're somewhere--
Sam: I'm in another plane of existence probably.
Matt: Yeah, you're having a real rough week right now is what you're having.
Liam: My arm is dead.
Laura: You're the only person alive.
Liam: Cheers.
Laura: And you of course.
Matt: (as Victor) Parts of me. (laughter and cheering)
Matt: (as Victor) What?
Laura: Cheers, Victor!
Travis: Yeah, cheers. Salut, bitches! (cheering)
All: Happy Halloween! (laughter)
Travis: I can't breathe.
Liam: So that's it. That's the show.
Matt: Yeah. Thanks guys, thanks for coming. We shall get into our announcements for the evening. I need my hand to do that. This is, by the way, pre-finger loss Victor. As I know there will be some purists out there like, why does he have all his fingers on his right hand? Matt, you're so inaccurate to your own character.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: All right, so first and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by Loot Crate.
Travis: Loot Crate! (cheering)
Laura: Get your maps off the table, Tyriok.
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: We've got an unboxing to do here with their last theme here. But before we get to that, Sam did you want to--
Sam: I wanted to say guys that this month's theme for Loot Crate is magic. And I don't have much planned for tonight, but I did learn a magic trick. I'm going to do a magic trick. It's my first magic trick I've ever done. And I don't have a deck of cards at home, so I'm going to use spell cards instead. I'm going to give it a little shuffle here. Oh, hey there, cowboy.
Travis: Oh, please let something come out of your mouth.
Sam: Taliesin, can you give it a shuffle?
Taliesin: I'll give it a shuffle. Liam, do you want to shuffle?
Liam: Sure, I've got it. We got 30 minutes, right?
Sam: Get ready for November's enchanting theme Magical! We've cast a powerful, ancient spell to deliver you this 100% exclusive crate. Featuring bewitching items from Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Big Trouble in Little China. And more! Use the promo link: lootcrate.com/criticalrole.
Matt: Marvel as Sam slowly becomes Bill Cosby. (Cosby impression) You see!
Liam: No, no, no, you can't take that back!
Sam: I'm going to show Taliesin that these are, in fact, randomly shuffled cards. Can you please give the card deck a little cut anywhere you'd like. I'm going to look at this half of the card deck and it'll tell me what's in the other half of the card deck. Okay. I know, Taliesin, by looking at that, that the fourth card down is See Invisibility.
Taliesin: The fourth card down.
Sam: The fourth card down is See Invisibility.
Taliesin: So, this card here will be--
Sam: Will be See Invisibility!
Taliesin: It's like Nicholas Cage as a cat. It is, in fact, See Invisibility! (cheering)
Sam: The most magical part of this trick is is that it makes me a quadruple threat: Actor! Singer! Professional Lover of Ladies! And now, Professional Magician. Thank you, Loot Crate. (cheering)
Taliesin: Remarkable Nicholas Cage impersonator, too, it's really amazing.
Sam: My mouth hurts so much right now.
Matt: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Loot Crate! Yeah, open your Loot Crates.
Laura: These are from October. These are not the current ones.
Taliesin: These are not the magic theme.
Marisha: No, it's the horror theme.
Sam: This is what everyone should be getting this month.
Laura: Okay, that's the coolest.
Travis: Are those Freddy Kruger chopsticks?
Laura: Yes, I think.
Matt: That's pretty badass.
Marisha: Little chibi Leatherface!
Travis: Of all the things you thought could never be cute. Leatherface.
Marisha: Little Leatherface.
Laura: I have to see if these are actually usable or not.
Matt: Negan shirt.
Liam: Got it! It's off!
Matt: Well done, Liam, well done.
Travis: Camp Crystal Lake.
Sam: Ooh, a little pennant. My son will love that, big fan of the movie.
Liam: I'm going to wear this for my kids all the time.
Matt: Regrettable Supervillains.
Taliesin: Too soon, guys, too soon. Just too soon.
Travis: Preying Mantis man. Cat Girl.
Taliesin: Camp Crystal Lake, oh that makes me happy.
Sam: These chopsticks are amazing.
Laura: The chopsticks are awesome, but don't try to pick up metal dice with them because they're way too heavy.
Liam: Don't eat metal dice.
Laura: Don't eat metal dice.
Travis: Ooh, the Walking Dead t-shirt. I call dibs on this next week!
Matt: There you go. Thank you very much, Loot Crate, for sponsoring us. You can go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole.
Travis: Promo code "criticalrole."
Liam: Beginner's luck.
Laura: That's right.
Travis: Good job.
Taliesin: That one's going to fail you every time, now.
Matt: That would have been impressive. Next up, let's see. GM Tips. We now have the second episode that just went up on YouTube. They go up a couple of days early on Alpha if you want to check that out. The most recent episode deals with improvisation, dealing with the unexpected. I'm a big fan of this new run. We get to go a little more in-depth with the elements of running your own games at home. So, if you're a GM, check them out. They come out every week, we have new ones coming out for the next six or so weeks. I can't remember how many episodes we did. So, for a while, so every week, a new one coming. Alpha on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, and then on Thursdays on YouTube, so check that out. Next up here we have Titanfall 2 came out!
Travis: Titanfall 2!
Matt: It's fun. I play Jack Cooper, your protagonist in the single-player campaign. It's basically a future buddy cop film with a giant robot.
Travis: You sound sexy in that, man. Just saying.
Matt: Thank you.
Laura: You do!
Travis: High noon!
Matt: (as Victor) It's how I like it! I'm like this the entire game!
Travis: That's a whole different Titanfall.
Liam: I'm in there too! I've returned from the first game as Barker and I will yell at you if you're in my faction. Damn, that's got some weight to it, son! Mmm!
Marisha: At least a d8.
Liam: (explosion noise)
Matt: And that was the end of Tyriok.
Liam: (as Tyriok) I shot something else off!
Matt: (laughs) Oh god.
Travis: Oh yeah! Telltale's Batman episode three came out. I really like the way that's going. Fun.
Laura: There's some good stuff happening in that episode.
Liam: Who is this Batman character?
Matt: Next up, our Critical Role Halloween costume contest finishes next week. Halloween night is the last time to submit so if you have a Halloween costume if you haven't finished yet, get it finished, put up some photos with the hashtag #criticalcostumes on Twitter. We will be judging those in the coming week and giving you guys prizes and rewards and all the silliness that we can try and produce for you because we're excited. So many good things are already out there. You guys have been crazy!
Laura: Yeah. There's been some really phenomenal--
Sam: Can I enter the contest as this?
Matt: I believe you already have, and you can win all of your shirts back.
Sam: Oh shit! Then I do not want to do that. (laughter)
Matt: Fantastic. Marisha. There is a new Signal Boost episode.
Marisha: Oh yeah! Both the Signal Boost Halloween episodes are out. And Taliesin and I are in them. And you make a cameo in the latest episode.
Matt: I stare at a mirror. It's fun.
Marisha: Yeah. Go watch for Halloween.
Matt: Travis. How about Talks Machina?
Travis: Yes! We are super excited about this one. Starting November 15th and every Tuesday after on Alpha we will finally get to introduce Talks Machina which is our Critical Role talk show. Hosted by our amazing friend Brian Wayne Foster. You can follow him at Brian Wayne Foster something something.
Marisha: It's like @brianwfoster.
Travis: @brianwfoster. And you can also catch the Talks Machina page on Twitter @talksmachina. You can also get early access if you go to alphainvite.com for early access to the page. We're going to be on there; it's our chance to give insight after the game. It'll be a weekly thing so we can answer questions that people might have, talk about moments that happened, how it went well, how it didn't, how we suck. There will always be a few of us on there every week, we might even have some guests, and some segments! It's going to be awesome. It's something we've been wanting to do for a while--
Laura: Yeah. And Brian's a really awesome guy so we're excited about it.
Marisha: Yeah. You guys are going to love him. He is great.
Matt: Brian is awesome.
Travis: Yeah. Hai!
Matt: Hai! That's all the major business announcements. The final announcement, for those who weren't paying attention to social media. Yeah. Take your glove off.
Marisha: Oh!
Travis: Take it off! Take that glove off!
Taliesin: We're doing that.
Sam: That's no fake hand!
Travis: That ring better be there!
Marisha: He put a ring on it! (cheering)
Liam: Applause, applause, applause!
Marisha: I have that to look forward to in my later years.
Matt: (as Victor) So excited!
Laura: Congratulations!
Liam: I mean, he doesn't have to take it off!
Matt: (as Victor) Only parts of it.
Sam: Are we going to do a Critical Role themed wedding?
Travis: Oh my god.
Marisha: No. No.
Matt: That's not going to be a thing. But we have already decided on our date.
Marisha: Although I might still have Travis Willingham as my flower girl. Doing the dust of tracelessness.
Travis: I would be honored.
Taliesin: So cute!
Sam: I'll start writing my Best Man speech. It'll be a song.
Matt: All the limericks in one.
Liam: Delivered in tiger?
Sam: Yes. Delivered in tiger makeup.
Matt: You've now done a tiger outfit twice. Two different tigers. All right. On that note, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Halloween Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. As we last left off, our band of adventurers, Vox Machina, were in the process of formulating their plan of attack against the Chroma Conclave, a group of chromatic dragons that had banded together under their king, a massive-sized red dragon that sundered the Tal'Dorei countryside and currently sits on the main city of Emon. You have traversed multiple planes of the world and have gathered these various artifacts called the Vestiges of Divergence in preparation for this battle, honing your skills. You guys, after finally defeating your third member of the Conclave and allying with a fourth, Raishan, you defeated Vorugal, the white dragon, over in the ruins of Draconia in Wildemount. You are now returning, after gathering the spoils of the fight, making your way to the next leg of your journey, to the very, very fast approaching conflict with the Cinder King himself. And that's where we begin. Last we left off in the middle of a nearby frozen forest, Percival and Vex, probably a fair distance of time apart make your-- no. (laughter)
Liam: That's "later."
Matt: Jumped the gun.
Liam: Matt, I don't know how we're going to do this. I got to look right at you.
Laura: Look directly below. Maybe stare at his eyes.
Liam: I'm going to look at the torch over his right shoulder. (laughter)
Travis: He's missing so many teeth!
Liam: We got to go shopping or drinking or something, nothing serious for the love of Sarenrae.
Matt: So! As you guys reconvene towards Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion to prepare for the next leg of your journey, what do you wish to do?
Sam: Wait, we're in the Mansion right now?
Laura: No, we're at the top of the ravine.
Taliesin: We're preparing to go through a portal.
Matt: Correct, you guys are. So you've gathered to go ahead and make--
Laura: Did you want to sleep before we went back to Whitestone?
Marisha: No, I can go. Yeah, no. It's been eight hours, I've done my thing?
Matt: Yes, for the restoring some of the farmland, yeah. Which as you complete the entirety of the spell, you watch as the rest of the snow melt begins to turn to water, and you watch as the land itself grows more fertile and the crops begin to pop forth. Like you began to see when the ritual initiated itself. With the completion of the land cleansed, you are free to go to the next length of your journey.
Marisha: Sorry.
Taliesin: Stop, I can't make eye contact. I'm sorry, it's okay. We'll get there.
Laura: I think you look great, Matt.
Liam: You look like Doc Brown exploded, I don't know what to do.
Taliesin: Pat that tuft of hair down.
Matt: Marty! Okay. Happy Halloween.
Liam: 30 more minutes, 30 more minutes and we'll settle down.
Marisha: You have to get immune to it.
Liam: I would like to set the Deathwalker's Ward to Matthew's costume.
Matt: All right, you take a short rest to set your-- (laughs).
Liam: That's from Vasselheim.
Matt: What else do you guys wish to do? What's the next step in your journey?
Sam: I mean we got to go back to Whitestone, right away? Is there anything else to do here? Is there anything to deliver, any piece of any body to take with us? Anything? We got everything already?
Laura: We need to deliver Ripley's arm back in Ank'Harel.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: That needs to happen.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: Kashaw's in Vasselheim.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: We need to do something about him.
Marisha: He might be in Whitestone by now.
Laura: He might be back. He might be on his way here.
Travis: He's a dick, he can take care of himself.
Laura: Hopefully, he won't just loose something on the Ravenites here.
Sam: Let's get out of here.
Marisha: They've been through so much.
Liam: I mean it's really reconfirming his whole life-view so, you know. Hi!
Laura: Hi!
Travis: I'm having trouble.
Sam: All right. Keyleth! Cast your thing and let's get the fuck out of here.
Laura: Let's get on to Whitestone. Get on getting on.
Marisha: I'm coming, boo.
Matt: As you focus and touch the outside of the tree, you watch as this small, familiar portal begins to tear its way through the outer bark of the nearby trunk. From there, as you reach through the magic creating this portal between you and Whitestone, you hear the voice echo in the distance, "I hear you." And thus, the temporary doorway between here and Whitestone is open. The rest of you guys rush through, with Kima and Pike in tow, you make your way into Whitestone itself. At this point in time, it looks like it's fairly late in the afternoon. It's still day here, that's a day, eight hours there. Actually no, it would be pretty early morning by here. At this point, you step out and the sky is starting to come to light. You see the blue slowly transitioning into a light orange to a yellow as the sunrise is making its way over the mountain range that surrounds the outside of Whitestone. You're met with a few wandering guards that wander through the town that acknowledge your presence, but it is your call as to what you wish to do now.
Sam: Does the town look like it's safe and intact?
Matt: It seems like it hasn't suffered any sort of incursion or attack, yeah.
Sam: Okay, yeah. That's good.
Marisha: We've only been gone for what? 24 hours?
Laura: No, like two days because we slept there.
Taliesin: About two days.
Marisha: I'm going to go check and see if I can find Kash.
Taliesin: Also going to head towards the castle. And we should drop off some of our spoils.
Laura: Our loot.
Travis: Where? Where do we drop them off at?
Laura: The castle?
Taliesin: I would imagine the treasury room is where it can be.
Matt: There is a treasury vault in the Whitestone castle.
Travis: Oh. Cool. Yeah. Totally knew about that place.
Matt: All right, Pike says she's going to go and check in with the temple and make sure everything there is taken care of and situated. Kima leaves with you guys towards the Whitestone castle. As you make your way up, you get to the very outside of the castle at the time the sunrise finally breaks the mountain range and you see the sun coming in. What little bit of mist begins to slowly burn off of the surrounding forested area. The cold, brisk morning air is immediately met with that warm ray of sun hitting you and it's welcoming both to be returning to a place of comfort but also the transition into day itself is a very warm and welcoming experience. As you step towards the front, there are four guards at the front gate. They step aside to let you in. As you step into the main foyer of the area, you already see a familiar sight. You see there waiting, arms crossed, leaning against the wall, Seeker Asum.
Laura: Scars still on the face?
Matt: Yeah, still acid-pocked scar across the right side, ruining the tattooed face. The rest of the castle seems relatively quiet at this time, as it is very early.
Marisha: She's the only one-- he's the only one there?
Matt: Within the actual foyer of the castle, yes, the main entrance area. As you guys begin to step inside, Seeker Asum steps in your direction. Steps in your direction, and Kima is already taking a brisk walk in that direction and goes, pointing outward toward Seeker Asum. "Now--"
Marisha: I grab Kima by the wrist. Not right now, maybe?
Matt: "Now you told me you'd already met with a creature. This is the--" At which point, Seeker Asum's hands rest on to Kima's shoulder. Kima's head whips around to face Asum, and Asum says, "You need not worry."
Sam: He's going to try a thing on her.
Laura: She hates that!
Sam: She doesn't like it.
Marisha: Oh no.
Taliesin: He's going to the sheets.
Matt: Kima's eyes blink for a moment and she--
Marisha: No no no no no no. I still have my hands on Kima, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I counter with a 6th-level Dispel Magic. Can I do that?
Matt: You can certainly try.
Marisha: Fuck.
Matt: All right, so as you begin to--
Laura: Oh no, we're going to start a fight, that's going to start a fight.
Marisha: I don't want her to fucking cast any shit on Kima.
Travis: What if it was just a chill out spell?
Marisha: It's probably a charm spell. Or a memory spell. No, I don't want to fucking wait--
Matt: It's not a Counterspell, but you can try to cast it on her to see if it has any effect.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: All righty, so the DC of the spell-- okay. So, as you pull back and begin chanting to yourself, clutching Kima and pulling her away from Asum, Asum's grip leaves Kima's shoulder and Kima's still shaking her head groggily. You finish the Dispel Magic and you feel the strange, warm pulse of energy radiate briefly out from Kima's body. Kima turns to look at you and goes, "What-- why would-- I'm sorry, I went groggy there for a second. We've had a long day. Good to see you, Asum." And Asum nods and says, "Well, the pleasure is mine. Glad to see you all made it back safe and sound."
Sam: Yes we did. Thank you, Asum.
Matt: "We have a meeting set here in the next two hours to gather our information and best situate the next plan of action. You also have a friend waiting for you. Your armored Kashaw returned but a half day ago apparently. Sleeping at the moment should you be interested in waking him from his slumber and notifying him of his, well, his services no longer being needed."
Travis: Did he return alone?
Matt: "He did. And rather proud with his findings."
Laura: Oh shit. Where are you off to now?
Matt: "Oh, I'm here waiting for the meeting."
Laura: Lovely.
Marisha: And who all is going to be a part of this meeting?
Matt: "As far as I know, it's going to be myself, Cassandra, Allura, and Drake."
Laura: Oh, good! Allura, we haven't seen her in forever. Have we?
Sam: We saw her pretty recently.
Laura: We did. Shit. Yes, we did. Never mind.
Sam: All right. Well then, until the meeting?
Matt: "Until the meeting. Now, food should be ready." And Asum steps out into the sunshine and closes his eyes, takes a deep breath as the sun rays hit and looks over his shoulder, smiles, and continues to walk down the path in towards Whitestone itself.
Sam: We can kill him right here, right now!
Marisha: (groans)
Travis: No, no. (coughs)
Matt: Kima takes a couple steps and says, "Wow, I'm more tired than I expected after that fight. Then again, we did kill a dragon! And that is fantastic!"
Travis: We did. Yeah. And you got a brilliant new sword.
Matt: Which she pulls out and (swish). You can see the arc of light streak across the blade as she flings it in the air with incredible strength for a halfling of her size. She's still marveled by it. "You know what? I'm not going to sleep. I'm going to go practice!" And she goes and runs off down one of the hallways towards one of the castle's training rooms.
Travis: Wait, Kima, Kima! You don't hear anything when you use that, do you? Like voices or someone talking to you or--
Matt: She holds the blade up to her ear. "No."
Travis: No, good! Good. It's a beginner problem, but you're quite advanced. Not worried about it. Enjoy!
Matt: "Thanks, Grog!" Slaps you on the shoulder with an awkward glance and continues the excited steps forward into vanishing somewhere into the castle.
Travis: The sword is clean.
Laura: Good job.
Travis: Yeah. Dodged a bullet on that one!
Laura: We should put that hide in the Treasury.
Travis: Hide?
Laura: The 140 pounds of dragonhide you're carrying right now?
Travis: Oh right! I'm dragging it behind me.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah. Right.
Taliesin: Like a body in a carpet.
Travis: Well, I'm off to deposit this hide!
Sam: Good object work!
Travis: Yeah. Boy, I'm going to need to switch shoulders! Getting a little roll in the ol' righty there.
Marisha: Keyleth grabs Vax as they wander off and pulls him behind the rest of the crowd.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Let's go.
Liam: Where?
Marisha: Let's track Raishan.
Liam: All right.
Marisha: Let's track her. Let's just do it right now. Let's kill her. We can do it, she won't be expecting it. We can find her.
Liam: I pull her further away. She won't expect it, but she is a fucking ancient being.
Marisha: But she's sick and she-- We can do it right now. When she's not armed.
Liam: Keyleth, I want to kill a dragon as much as you do.
Marisha: It's not about killing a dragon, it's about killing her.
Liam: I know, but we want it to work. We want her to die. And if you and I do it, it's not going to happen. Her being sick is still up here. We need the others. I really want to use both my arms to take her, but I can't. I take her by the arms. And we need the others. If I thought we could do it-- Listen to me. I love you, and if you ask me again, I will go with you. But I don't think it will work. I think you and I will die. I think Raishan will spit on our bodies. You will not get what you want. And then Thordak won't die. No one will be happy. I understand--
Marisha: I just want this to be over.
Liam: I want this to be over.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: We need to stay with the others; there's--
Marisha: Okay. Okay. I understand.
Liam: Listen to me; if you tell me to go in, I will go in. But there's strength with the others. After this, if you tell me to go in, you say the word. It's not like I haven't tried to throw my life away already. You think I wouldn't do it for you?
Marisha: I feel like it's very telling when Grog has more patience than I. (sighs) Okay.
Liam: Hey. It'll happen.
Marisha: I just don't want to wait so long that she gets the upper hand on us. The longer we wait, the more she learns about us. The more we're letting her in, the more we're revealing. I feel like the longer we wait, the closer is her inevitable betrayal.
Liam: Pulls her in and touch foreheads. I don't think we're going to be waiting for long; I really don't.
Marisha: Okay. Let's catch up with the others.
Liam: Yeah. Yeah.
Matt: The rest of you, what have you been up to?
Sam: I pull Percy aside and say, we can kill her right now.
Liam: Ugh! It's a tiger!
Taliesin: Well?
Sam: Well, we got to go to the treasury.
Taliesin: We have to go to the treasury.
Sam: And then what? Who do we need to check in with? Everyone, right? Gilmore and Kash and--
Laura: We've got a couple hours.
Taliesin: We have a couple hours. We need to talk to people. We need to find out where this meeting's being held, if it's being held downstairs or if it's being held in the battle room.
Laura: It won't be if Asum has anything to say about it.
Taliesin: Well, maybe he won't.
Sam: And what is this meeting? I know that we have to have a conversation with Asum.
Marisha: Yeah, but what is this about?
Taliesin: This meeting may be the beginning of something very violent or this may be the start of something; I don't know. But be prepared perhaps that this meeting may be on moment.
Travis: (singing) Be prepared.
Taliesin: Don't think about it. Don't plan. Don't have any thoughts in your head.
Laura: Improvise. We're good at that.
Taliesin: You can't lie about anything. Do not lie to her about anything. And one of the ways we can lie best is by truthfully saying we have no plans against her right now because we have no plans against her right now. The more we talk, the more she will be able to perceive our deceptions, if we have any. Be very careful. This is going to be very dangerous. There's going to be a lot of improvisation.
Laura: I hate knowing that she's going to be able to hear all of our plans.
Marisha: (sighs)
Taliesin: Honestly, we should have assumed that they could hear all of our plans from the beginning.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: (sighs) My fault, really. Well, we are very good at being spied on.
Sam: Yes, well, we like to talk.
Taliesin: And even if we do, even if we were to get rid of her, there's no sense in believing that they still don't know everything we're doing.
Sam: All right. Then we'll see what he proposes and take it from there.
Taliesin: And let's hope that we're downstairs, and if we're not downstairs, there's still options.
Laura: All right.
Matt: Grog, you've finally caught up with the group. You've managed to drop off your large amount of dragon hide in return.
Travis: Holy shit, that skin weighs a ton. Good thing I'm strong as fuck. What'd I miss?
Sam: Is there a cold place in the treasure room? Wait, this hide is going to be cured, or smoked, or something, whatever you do. Stretched?
Laura: It's got scales all over it. I mean that stays, right? It doesn't have to be kept cold?
Matt: I mean, it probably should be.
Laura: Kept cold.
Matt: It probably should be attended to in a short amount of time, like in the next week or so, before it's really--
Laura: Would it be an armorer, or a blacksmith, or-- who works with dragonhide?
Sam: Taliesin, what's the old fashioned word for the guy who does the hide stuff?
Liam: Tanner.
Sam: A tanner! Thank you!
Laura: Is there a tanner in Whitestone?
Taliesin: One would assume we have a tanner in Whitestone.
Matt: There are a few tanners, yeah.
Travis: Is it super cold where I dropped off the hide? Like is it below ground?
Matt: It's below ground. Yeah, it's not--
Travis: A bit chilly?
Matt: Comparatively. Whitestone in general is a pretty chilly place, so yeah.
Sam: But not like a fake-bake. We want a real tanner, right?
Liam: Hey, while they're talking about all this, can I stealth away?
Matt: Yes, you can. Make a stealth check.
Liam: I'll use Luck. 28.
Matt: What was that?
Liam: 28.
Matt: 28. Okay, yeah. You vanish without anybody else noticing your disappearance.
Liam: I would like to go as quickly as I can towards Gilmore's house.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: He's cheating on you, Keyleth.
Marisha: (laughs) Look, it's 2016.
Travis: Did we decide what we do about Raish--?
Laura: (shushing)
Taliesin: Seeker Asum?
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: We're going to talk, we're going to listen, and we're going to be prepared for anything.
Travis: Okay, so we're not (death noises and farts)?
Laura: Not just yet.
Taliesin: We're going to talk, we're going to listen, and be prepared for anything.
Sam: Was that last sound the sound of Seeker Asum's bowels?
Travis: It's open to interpretation.
Sam: Okay. After he dies, letting it all out?
Travis: Yeah. Just want to be fancy. I lean that way but, you know. Cannot speak for other people.
Taliesin: The work speaks for itself, really.
Matt: Fair enough. Vax, as you rush down towards the homestead that Gilmore had made here in Whitestone, the door is closed. There's a large pile out front of ruined furniture that's been jammed into this collection. Presumably from the last encounter they had when the incursion of assassins made their way in. But the door's closed, and seemingly locked.
Liam: (knocks)
Matt: A few moments pass, no response. (Mario coin sound)
Liam: That's him, that's magic!
Matt: But you find a cool coin.
Liam: (knocks)
Matt: Yeah. Eventually you hear a little rustling, and you hear a voice, muffled, from the upper floor say, "Confound it, I'll be right down!"
Liam: I'm so scared of this with that hair on your head.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You hear some footsteps, and then eventually the door (unlocking sound). You hear the unlocking mechanism. The door swings open a little bit. And you see, you know, morning robe, chest open, curly chest hair poking out. A very groggy bedhead. Gilmore opens the door. "Yes, can I help-- Oh. Good morning." (laughter)
Travis: I don't know what to do.
Liam: Why did I do this? Tonight?
Marisha: Now you know why.
Liam: Hey, this is not fair. Can I come in to talk? Quickly, I have to head back to the others.
Matt: "Of course. Would you like some tea?"
Liam: No. I don't even have time, I just want to talk to you.
Matt: "I'd like some tea. Come on in, come on in."
Liam: All right.
Matt: He ushers you to enter, and leads you to one of the small chairs. And he walks back into the kitchen, shouting over his shoulder, "So! Vax'ildan, please. Tell me what's on your mind."
Liam: You know, we're getting closer to the end game here.
Matt: (laughs) "I certainly hope so. It's taken a couple years off my lifespan."
Liam: We just killed another one of the dragons.
Matt: "Really?!"
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: "How many is that for you now? Three?"
Liam: It is three.
Matt: "Making a name for yourself. I'm proud of you." A few moments pass, and silence. And Gilmore walks back out, clutching a small tray with a few teacups. And as he's walking, he's twirling his finger and you can see a little spiral of flame encircling the tea kettle as it begins to heat up. He brings it over, sets it down on the table. Pulls his robe in and sits down across from you on this low slung tea table. Takes a bit and sips it. "So, what brings you here this early in the morning, friend?"
Liam: I think I might be dead in a couple of days. So I came here to apologize. If you think I have no feelings for you, you're kidding yourself. I care for you very deeply. I have for a long time. And I don't think I've treated you fairly. But I wasn't playing games. Shaun. It's been a little weird lately, and I understand why, but I want you to know that I love you as a dear, dear friend, and I really don't think I'm going to be here in a few days. And I would hate to think that I would be--
Matt: "Shh. That's far too fatalistic for the Vax'ildan that I-- number one. Number two, you have nothing to apologize for. Look, everything's on fire around us all the time. We all jump at whatever bit of comfort finds its way before us. And at the same time, I appreciate your honesty. And I'm thankful for the connection that we do have. And yes, heartbreak comes. But heartbreak goes. It's part of life. It just means that I need to find somebody who's a little more my speed."
Liam: That guy'll be fast.
Matt: "He better be. Don't worry about it. Go. Kill a dragon. Another. Kill two more. Kill six more, I don't care! Just know that you're coming back, because I need you and your friends to keep pimping out my name."
Liam: Sure. Whoever gets you will be a very lucky man.
Matt: "I know. I know."
Liam: Love you.
Matt: "I know. You sure you don't want any tea?"
Liam: I'm really nauseous right now. I almost didn't come here.
Matt: "I'm glad you did." He takes your cup. "Waste not, want not. (sips) Now go! Stop being uncomfortable in front of me! I need to get my morning--"
Liam: Yeah. Yes.
Matt: "--situated."
Liam: Goodbye.
Matt: He stands there. Waves his hand and the door opens on its own.
Liam: I leave.
Matt: He takes you by the shoulder real fast before you leave, and turns around and goes, "'Till next time. Say it."
Liam: 'Till next time.
Matt: "All right. Go." And you feel a little pat on your backside, on the way out. He sits there holding his tea, watching you leave. Door slams behind you. You make your way back.
Liam: I'm sorry I made you do that in that skullcap, Matt.
Matt: Look, I don't have to look at this. I'm fine! (laughter)
Matt: From my perspective, this is easy.
Liam: All I saw was a very handsome man. (laughter)
Travis: Training. This is all training. It's training at a thousand times gravity.
Matt: (laughs) It totally is! Like performing arts with the weights on.
Liam: Been doing this since the 80s and 90s, man.
Laura: We need to find Kashaw. Before the meeting, yes?
Marisha: Yeah, I set off. To find Kashaw with Vex.
Matt: All right. Asking around quickly, he is back in the room where he's been staying in Whitestone. You go back to his door. It's closed.
Marisha: (knocks)
Laura: Kash?
Matt: Nothing.
Laura: (loudly) Are you sleeping?
Matt: Nothing.
Sam: Break down the door.
Marisha: Kash?
Laura: I'm going to jiggle the lock. Is it locked?
Matt: It's not locked.
Laura: I open it. Just a crack, and look in.
Marisha: I hope you're not naked!
Laura: Shh.
Matt: As you open it up, there's no light on the inside, but the light does come in as you slowly open the door with a (squeaks). You can see he's halfway out of his armor, passed out on his back, on the bed. He's one arm out, snoring loudly like he was too tired to make it all the way, and (snores).
Laura: Should we let him sleep or should we talk to him?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: He snores.
Marisha: Wow.
Laura: You know, my brother doesn't snore.
Marisha: No, I know.
Travis: Ew.
Marisha: No, I mean I don't--
Laura: No, just don't, just don't.
Marisha: Just don't worry about it. (laughter)
Taliesin: I love you, Travis.
Liam: You thought I'd be the one to fuck up. (laughter)
Laura: Do I have any like stones or any like rocks or anything in my bag or--
Marisha: You're going to throw a rock at him?
Laura: Yeah, just to see if he wakes up.
Marisha: We can't just poke him? That seems so weird, though.
Sam: You're an archer.
Laura: Well, I don't want to kill him.
Marisha: Why don't we just tap on his shoulder?
Laura: I'll sneak in, tap his shoulder, come back out, see if he wakes up.
Marisha: Oh, that's what I want to do.
Laura: I don't want him to know that, you know--
Marisha: That we did that? Sure. I'll stand on the outside and look unsuspecting.
Laura: I want to sneak in and tickle his little foot and walk out.
Matt: Well, he still has his boots on.
Laura: Shit.
Matt: It's more like his upper torso, he got partway out of that.
Laura: All right, I tickle his hands.
Matt: Okay so you're opening his palm--
Laura: Tickle his hands and then go back really fast to the doorway.
Matt: Okay, you tickle his hand. No response.
Laura: Fucking--
Matt: (snores)
Laura: I flick his nose.
Matt: As soon as you flick his nose and you start to back away, there's a blur of motion as suddenly he comes leaping out of the bed (grunts) and goes over and grabs his spear, his hand reaches for nothing in the air, and slings it forward in your direction, (whoosh) bypassing by your face by a few inches. And he looks still half awake, going (startled noises).
Marisha: Oh Kash, oh hi. Fancy meeting you here. Shit.
Matt: "Yeah, it's my room."
Marisha: I keep doing that.
Laura: I know; it's awkward.
Laura: Hi.
Marisha: Hi.
Matt: "Hi." And he throws his spear to the side.
Laura: Oh good, I was wondering if--
Marisha: Yeah, I hope we didn't-- I hope you weren't sleeping.
Matt: "I hope I wasn't either. Sure, all right, I'm glad you're here because it took me a long-ass time to get here." And he sits up in the bed and-- or he sits down back on the bed and reaches over and pulls out one of his packs and brings out a couple of rolls of paper. "Okay, so I talked to Vanessa and got two contracts that we could take up for this."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "We got one here," and he pulls it out, "This is for two indigenous creatures to the region that you were talking about over by Wildemount. One is a purple worm matron."
Laura: Ooh, that sounds big.
Matt: "Supposedly. Shit's dangerous. Careful. This one is for a Storm Giant. This one is a little harder to get a hold of apparently."
Laura: They're so hard to get a hold of. We should probably focus on the other one.
Marisha: Mm-hmm.
Laura: Unless Vorugal's already dead.
Marisha: Yeah, wouldn't that be crazy if he was already dead?
Laura: What would we do with these contracts if he is? Just wondering about that.
Matt: "Get out of my room."
Marisha: Kash.
Matt: "Just get out."
Marisha: Kash.
Matt: "Get out of my room."
Marisha: Look--
Laura: Your help has been--
Marisha: Not overlooked.
Matt: "Out. Of my room."
Laura: We should probably go.
Marisha: We should probably go.
Laura: Do you want these back--
Matt: "Out of my room."
Laura: I'm going to set them down on the ground.
Matt: "Out of my room."
Marisha: You know, we could--
Matt: "Get out of my room."
Laura: By the way, you might want to get like a mouthguard or something because you snore a little.
Matt: You leave him in silence and darkness. (yelling) "Out of my room!"
Laura: Keyleth, we should go.
Marisha: Okay. Okay. We'll see you later.
Laura: Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Laura: Come here.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: And I take her around a corner. He kissed me.
Marisha: Kash?
Laura: No! God no! Percy!
Marisha: Like right now?
Laura: Percival!
Marisha: Did I miss something?
Laura: No.
Marisha: What? Percy?
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: (squeals)
Laura: I know.
Marisha: That's good, right?
Laura: I mean I know you guys are like--
Marisha: No!
Laura: Pretty close and I don't know if that's weird.
Marisha: Why are you asking me?
Laura: I don't know, you're like his sister, kind of.
Marisha: He's not my twin brother.
Laura: This is true. How are things with you and Vax? Thanks for bringing it up. Is it good?
Marisha: I still worry if you care.
Laura: I care; of course I care.
Marisha: Yeah, you say that.
Laura: I hug her. Well not your antlers in my face.
Marisha: Oh, sorry, sorry, that happens a lot. I'm very happy for you.
Laura: Hey thanks. We should go look at the treasury.
Marisha: Okay, let's go to the treasury. We should go victory shopping.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Do you think he'd mind if we-- I mean we have so much money, we don't even need to do that.
Marisha: I mean it's basically our money, though, right?
Laura: Yeah. No. It's--
Marisha: Yeah. Okay.
Matt: All right, so you guys wander your way off--
Marisha: You know, Vex, I feel like you might be a bad or good influence on me. I'm not sure, but I like it.
Laura: It's all good.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Scanlan, Grog, Percival. What are you guys doing?
Taliesin: Life is failing the Bechdel Test so hard right now.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: So bad.
Taliesin: Sorry. (laughs) Carry on.
Laura: Sometimes they do talk about boys.
Marisha: They are like 50% of--
Taliesin: No, I did not see that coming.
Travis: We don't really need to like check in with anything.
Sam: You mean do you have the gold?
Travis: Well I mean I-- yeah.
Sam: We should probably divvy it up, don't you think?
Travis: What? What? What?
Taliesin: No, no, no.
Travis: But it's really a lot to hold onto your person. I mean, it's a bag of gold--
Sam: No, but we should all replenish our personal--
Taliesin: You can have some pocket money, but--
Sam: Yes, yes, yes.
Travis: Yeah. How much do you want? You don't have it. I have it.
Sam: 5000. We have hundreds.
Travis: Yeah, if you want 5000. Do you have good credit?
Sam: Do I have good credit?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I've never misspent a single coin.
Travis: Can I have your last four pay stubs, please? (laughter)
Sam: Here's two of them right here.
Travis: Hey! That's good enough! Have 5000 gold!
Matt: As Grog gives you 5000 gold, which weighs roughly a hundred pounds--
Sam: Shit!
Matt: It weighs more than you do.
Laura: 5000 gold is a hundred pounds?
Travis: And it's probably about 1000 because I can't count to 5000.
Matt: Yeah. He starts divvying it out until it's like larger than you in a pile in the center of the room.
Taliesin: Well what are you going to do with it?
Sam: All right, all right. I'm going to give some back.
Travis: Are you really?
Sam: Why don't you give me ten platinum.
Taliesin: No! Absolutely--
Sam: (chuckles) It's the same! It's the same!
Travis: Why not?
Liam: Ten platinum?
Taliesin: Ten platinum is an awful lot.
Travis: But he can carry ten. That's easier.
Liam: Sure.
Travis: Hold on, let me consult Blackstone.
Liam: Ten or ten thousand?
Taliesin: (stage whisper) Don't do it!
Travis: Yep. Stoneblack says it's all right.
Sam: You're with us. You're with us.
Taliesin: I am!
Travis: I take the gold. I put it back in.
Taliesin: No!
Travis: And I give him ten platinum, which is actually six.
Matt: So you get six platinum from Grog, which is roughly sixty gold.
Travis: One. Three. Seven. Eight. Nine. 40. Ten.
Sam: That's it?
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: Excellent.
Sam: And give me 500 gold, as well.
Taliesin: No!
Sam: Of course. I need money.
Travis: It's really heavy. How about I give you 20 more platinum?
Sam: Great. That sounds good.
Travis: And I give him four more.
Sam: (laughs) Give me 50 more platinum.
Travis: 50?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: All right. I give you one more.
Sam: Thank you. 11 platinum.
Matt: Perfect.
Taliesin: I'm going to try to find Allura. I'm going to leave them to their madness. I'm going to try and find Allura and Cassandra or anybody I can find in the castle at this point.
Matt: Okay. As you walk around, nobody else who's supposed to be meeting has gathered yet. However, Cassandra is awake and in the process of going through some papers. She has her personal guard at her side and two guards at the door and you can see she's getting herself prepared for the meeting. As you enter the room, the door partially ajar, you see her still down currently thumbing through notes. Her hair is still in disarray and pulled back haphazardly. And she's wearing her morning gown and without even looking up goes, "Percival. Glad you've arrived and still in one piece."
Taliesin: Yes. And down one dragon.
Matt: "I have to tell you, I'm very impressed."
Taliesin: Thank you. Two more to go. It's going to get a little heavier at this point.
Matt: "Indeed. That's what our meeting is about."
Iphone: What was that, again?
Taliesin: What was that, again?
Matt: "Sorry, I need to go fire some of my guards. They're making a nuisance. Continue, please."
Taliesin: Two more to go. I fear that it's possible that Whitestone itself may eventually be a target of an attack. I feel it may be inevitable.
Matt: "That is, actually, what our meeting is about. Prevent that from happening."
Taliesin: Quickly to check. I would know what languages Cassandra spoke, correct?
Matt: What languages do you know?
Taliesin: Elven, Celestial, Common.
Matt: She knows Elven and Common. She does not know Celestial.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: That was more your hobby.
Taliesin: I figured. That was my guess. I wanted to confirm.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I hand her a small slip of paper that I have written in Elven: "Be prepared for anything today. Keep silent."
Matt: She gives you a very keen look. And you can see Cassandra. As much as she is the healthiest you've seen her physically, her eyes have dark circles over them. It looks like she's been very harried by the events of these past few weeks. Understandably so. But she takes and looks over the sheet and goes, "Well, very well. Should be an interesting meeting then."
Taliesin: I think so. I do think so. It's good to see you taking command.
Matt: "It's good to see you, and I look forward to you sharing some of the burden soon."
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "Right?"
Taliesin: Quite possibly.
Matt: "Right?"
Taliesin: We will discuss whence the dragons are taken care of.
Matt: "Good."
Taliesin: We will discuss, at the very least, relieving you of some of this burden.
Matt: "Good."
Taliesin: I know it is not fair.
Matt: "Whatever is fair in this life? The wonders of lordship and ladydom."
Sam: I'm going to run off and try to find Jarett.
Matt: Okay. Do you wish to come? Anything else you want to bring to this conversation?
Taliesin: No, I'm fine with that. My last thing is, I'm going to quickly run and have a quick conversation privately with-- I assume we have some sort of royal jeweler of some kind, or somebody who does some of the ornamental work.
Matt: No one who lives on site per se, but there are two individuals that your family generally used for various forms of jewel craft.
Taliesin: I'm going to write and send a letter off for that.
Matt: Okay. No worries. Scanlan, what are you going to do? Looking for Jarett?
Sam: Looking for Jarett.
Matt: Okay. You head outside of the main castle, down to where the training barracks are for Whitestone. And you can see Jarett's already out there, with a small, metallic platter on his lap, scarfing up some food real fast. He's gotten his day started relatively early and as soon as you approach, mouth's already full. "Mmm! Scanlan! It's good to see you."
Sam: Good to see you too! What're you enjoying there?
Matt: (laughs) "The usual gruel that you find in this city."
Sam: Oh, I thought it might be something, meat-based that you could have popped up a bit with your spice.
Matt: "Oh, well trust me, I've used it on the eggs and it makes it bearable. Whitestone is not well known for its cuisine from what I can tell. Everything's gray and lacks flavor."
Sam: I'll invite you over to my house some time, give you a proper chicken dinner.
Matt: "All right, I will happily take you up on that offer, thank you."
Sam: Wanted to check in on (lowers voice) the task we talked about?
Matt: "The task?"
Sam: You know, the mission we discussed.
Matt: "Remind me again?"
Sam: I don't want to talk about it out in the open. But you know there was some illicit--
Matt: "Oh!"
Sam: Items of medicine.
Matt: "Yes, I sent a request through someone I know."
Sam: Sent a request?! You're using other people? I trust you, I don't trust other people!
Matt: "I'm not going to leave the city right now to go find-- Look, I have two people I know that might be able to get what you need. But it's going to take time."
Sam: (sighs) I don't have time. (sighs)
Matt: "When did you pick up this habit?! I'm worried about you now, Scanlan."
Sam: I haven't picked it up. I'm trying to pick it up, damn it! It's the most difficult habit to pick up! Listen, can I confide in you, man to man, one on one, here?
Matt: "Certainly."
Sam: You're a fighter, you're a strapping young battle man, aren't you?
Matt: (chuckles) "I have been told this once or twice, yes."
Sam: I haven't felt myself recently. You know, we have these fights and some of them are pretty epic and there's monsters involved and I'm usually on my game, but lately I'm feeling a little off! How do you cope with that?
Matt: "Well largely by not using illicit substances?!"
Sam: Don't judge! Don't judge.
Matt: "I'm not judging! I'm worried about you. Like, if you don't even have a habit, why would you look for this? The Scanlan I knew, the one that hired me, he knew how to deal with this issue. He got laid."
Sam: I don't really do that much anymore.
Matt: "Maybe that's why you're not feeling up to the task?" (laughs)
Sam: That is a very fair point, Jarett.
Matt: "I'm just saying. Look, and I do not mean to talk out of turn." He sets his meal aside. "But you are a man who walks, driven by his pelvis. Am I wrong?"
Sam: You're not wrong.
Matt: "Then what happens if the pelvis goes unused? Grows bashful?"
Travis: Preach.
Sam: Like a fine instrument, it can go untuned. If you leave a fine violin without playing it for many years, it could wither and rot until you need to replace some of the parts. In a way, the same is true for my member. But the problem here, Jarett, is that I'm distracted. I'm distracted by things that haven't ever distracted me before. I've made a promise to someone to stay alive. I've never valued my own life before and when we get into the shit, I'm second-guessing things. I'm making stupid decisions that I wouldn't have otherwise made.
Matt: "Because suddenly you have purpose. Because you have a reason to come back."
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "That's not a bad thing, then."
Sam: I don't know how to harness that kind of stress.
Matt: "Do you have a keepsake of this reason to return, this person you made a promise to?"
Sam: Do I have a keepsake? I don't think so.
Matt: "Then you need to get yourself a keepsake!"
Sam: Well she's not around right now to get a keepsake from.
Matt: "Then something else that reminds you of her. Something that you can look at in that moment when you're not so sure."
Sam: How did you get so wise, Jarett?
Matt: "Drink a lot, listen to people talk. There are none wiser than barkeeps, my friend, and I have been friends with many a barkeep."
Sam: These are all good suggestions. But I'm a man of instinct, and my instincts said I need to supplement my body with some extra liquid courage. So if you can please continue to look for me.
Matt: "I will continue searching and providing what you require."
Sam: I've heard that it can help people in moments of panic and stress.
Matt: "And I've watched it ruin lives near K'Tawl Swamp!"
Sam: I can handle a lot of things.
Matt: "You are a strange gnome."
Sam: Takes one to know one?
Matt: "Does not work in this circumstance but I applaud your attempt. It was good. I'll do what I can. But don't forget you have more than one reason to stick around."
Sam: I know. That's what worries me. I'll think about what you said. Maybe I'll go have a toss, see if that helps, too.
Matt: "Here, tell you what. Come here."
Sam: Yes?
Matt: And he suckerpunches you in the face. You unexpectedly fall back. You feel the pulsing of the blood run to your cheek. Your eyesight goes white for a second. He goes, "See, now you have to live to return the favor."
Sam: You! That was clever. I will definitely get you back.
Matt: "Good. I look forward to it."
Sam: Watch your back.
Matt: "I always do."
Sam: Get me some drugs!
Matt: Awesome. Grog.
Travis: It's daytime, right?
Matt: Yeah, it's early morning.
Travis: Is there a way I can find a courtyard or an open-air area?
Matt: There are a couple of courtyards within the perimeter walls of the castle. They have some small garden elements.
Travis: If I get there, are there a lot of guards keeping an eye?
Matt: Not within the courtyard, no. Occasionally, there'll be one patrolling.
Travis: Can I pee in the courtyard?
Matt: By all means!
Travis: I feel like I need to mark my territory. This is home for us, and I peed all over Greyskull Keep. I left little puddles that y'all didn't know about. It's real important in case other goliaths come around and are like, (sniff) "Nope, the wolf's here. I got to go elsewhere."
Taliesin: I assumed it was shoddy masonry and everything was leaking.
Travis: No, stealth roll, motherfucker. Can I take a leak on a wall in the courtyard?
Matt: Yeah and there are a number of walls to choose from: varying heights, different levels of masonry. You have the veritable pick of the litter.
Travis: Can I find the highest wall with the most ornate decoration on it and go slightly off left? The way me member goes and make a little box right there? A little waterfall on the whitestone.
Matt: Certainly. You find the portion where the exterior wall has one little parapet-joining portion with the exterior of the castle itself. There, you can see the masonry is fine, the stones themselves are clean-cut and joined properly. There isn't a whole lot in the way of ornate craftsmanship on the exterior of the castle or the walls, but you feel, as far as your interest, Grog, this is a good wall.
Travis: Very nice.
Matt: You mark your territory expertly.
Travis: In a wide, arcing pattern, not like the one shot, like a nice, upside-down crown.
Matt: There you go, like a Cylon eyebeam. Yeah, totally. You do so with gusto. Congratulations.
Travis: Thank you. Home.
Matt: That's how Grog spells home.
Marisha: Stellar RP.
Travis: How else do you spell home?
Matt: Unless there's anything else that needs to be done--
Liam: I'm not done with my errands. Can I go find Kynan?
Matt: You can. Kynan, who is currently under the watch of Jarett at the moment, is asleep. You start walking towards the direction as Scanlan is leaving the exterior of the barrack training grounds.
Liam: Hey, buddy.
Sam: Hi.
Liam: You look a little rough. You all right?
Sam: I'm fine. One of our employees punched me in the face.
Liam: Which one?
Sam: You don't want to know. It wasn't the cooking cook.
Liam: You look really tense. You look out of character.
Sam: (growls)
Liam: Oh dear. Head back. We're going to have that meeting soon. Get your game face on, yeah?
Sam: I will. I'll wash my face. Get to it.
Liam: All right.
Sam: How are you doing?
Liam: I'm good.
Sam: Yeah?
Liam: Best I've been in a while.
Sam: That's good to hear. It's been a while since we had one of our depressing chats. You seem a little more chipper these days. Coming around to my perspective, are you?
Liam: Can I make an insight check?
Matt: Yeah, make an insight check.
Liam: Seems full of shit to me. I'm going to use luck. I've got it.
Travis: That's your second luck!
Liam: Who cares? This is a game. I'm with my friends. I'm having fun. That is an 18.
Matt: 18. Are you deceiving him any?
Sam: No! Not at all.
Liam: But does he seem confident and happy is what I wanted to know.
Matt: As much as he would in the given situation, yeah.
Liam: All right. (sighs) I'm happy. I'm in love.
Sam: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Do I know the fella?
Liam: Yeah. I'll tell you later, all right?
Sam: I want to hear details! Dirty, dirty details! Sweaty details!
Liam: Oh, he is so hung. Unbelievably hung.
Marisha: So much dick talk!
Liam: I'll tell you later. I have to run an errand. We have to get to this fucking meeting, yeah?
Sam: Oh yeah. I'll see you there. Game face on.
Marisha: Is this how they talk themselves up?
Travis: Yeah, don't women talk about their vaginas?
Liam: I'm talking about your goddamn antlers. Jeepers. Off I go.
Sam: Locker room talk.
Laura: Oh. (laughter)
Liam: (yells) No!
Matt: The campaign is over. Whitestone burns in flames. You make your way there. Jarett, you can see, finishing a meal. Looks over to you. There's nobody else in the training area. It's still relatively early. You do, with your perception, see back on the main stone building, you see a few individuals walking back and forth in front of one of the windows. It looks like things are starting up over there for training for the day. Jarett finishes his meal, scarfs up the last bit of egg on the side of the plate, "Hey!"
Liam: Jarett!
Matt: "Yes!"
Liam: Hey, I don't want to interrupt. Kynan, the new guy. Is he around?
Matt: "Probably inside, sleeping or waking."
Liam: Okay if I go in?
Matt: "Sure. This way."
Liam: Just be a minute.
Matt: "Sure, go for it." He sits back down. You head inside. The door's not locked. You open it. You see ten different individuals that are all in the process of waking up. You can smell coffee. Very basic breakfast meats being cooked. Some of them are around tables talking, hunched forward and laughing. As soon as you walk in, a few of them turn and look at you. Some don't recognize you, some do. You see, in the far corner sitting alone at one of the tables is Kynan, who is prison-style guarding his food and eating by himself.
Liam: Right towards him. Hey.
Matt: "Hello."
Liam: How are you fitting in?
Matt: "All right. Everyone here's been fine."
Liam: You hanging back?
Matt: "I mean, as much as I need to. This is still a lot. Jarett's been good. He's been watching."
Liam: He's a good man. Yeah, I get it. We killed another dragon.
Matt: "That-- wow."
Liam: Yeah. I don't want you to question your decision here, all right?
Matt: "No, I mean-- I don't have anything else right now really. So, what's the question?"
Liam: There's no question. But if you could, I have two favors I want to ask.
Matt: "Okay."
Liam: First one is, after I leave here today, could you embrace these people?
Matt: "Yeah, I'm trying."
Liam: Yeah, I know, and I know you have reservations, and I know that you've got guilt. When I walk out of here, I want you to work on letting go of that. For real! Leap of faith kind of shit. Just let go of it.
Matt: (sighs) "Well, I'll do my best."
Liam: I know. Scratch that, three favors.
Matt: He looks down a little bit for a second seeming like "oh boy."
Liam: Yeah, I know I'm a handful. The second one, I don't even need for you to say anything about this, but you know the white-haired guy I travel with?
Matt: "Yeah."
Liam: Yeah. He's got a sister, and I don't want you to do anything other than keep an eye on her and keep her safe.
Matt: "Okay?"
Liam: We're going into the lion's den. Soon, I think. And we'll probably come out of it, but just in case. She's got a lot on her shoulders; you know that. So just keep an eye on her. That's it. All right?
Matt: "All right."
Liam: And the last thing. You've got those knives I gave you, right?
Matt: "Yeah."
Liam: Yeah, hold onto them. I trust you. I need you to watch after one last thing thing for me, all right? It's very important. I wake up Simon, and I let him crawl down my arm. Do you see this guy?
Matt: "Yeah."
Liam: He's been with me through a lot, and I don't want him at the bottom of a ditch.
Matt: "Are you sure?"
Liam: I have never been more sure of anything in my life. I want you to have him, and I want you to take care of him.
Matt: "I'll do that. It'll be done. I promise."
Liam: Kynan, I need you to believe in second chances.
Matt: "It's all I have to keep me going right now." He reaches his hand up towards the snake, and Simon leaps from from your hand to his and swirls down his arm. He looks confused for a second as it wraps around his waist and then forms into the shape of a belt. You now see a few other guys in the room, and the room's got a little bit quieter. They're all watching what's happening, "What's going on?" He notices the attention and, "I'll take good care of him."
Liam: I believe you.
Matt: "I mean no offense. It's a lot of attention right now."
Liam: I give a slap on his cheek. Remember everything I said, all right?
Matt: "Yeah, I will."
Liam: You're a good kid. (whack)
Matt: (soft chuckle) "Same temple."
Liam: I'll see you later, all right?
Matt: "Yeah. Definitely." And you head out. Okay. At this point in time, a number of pages have been sent throughout the city to gather those who've been wandering about Whitestone, as you are being called to the meeting in the second floor war room held within the castle itself.
Marisha: Second floor?
Matt: Same one where you met with--
Marisha: Asum? That'll do. All right.
Taliesin: Be ready for anything.
Travis: Let's go Krogering! The best of everything!
Marisha: Before we walk in, I grab Grog. How do you do it?
Travis: Do what?
Marisha: You're able to utilize your rage when necessary. How do you keep it suppressed when it's not needed?
Travis: Ah. Well, good question.
Marisha: Please enlighten me, Professor Grog.
Travis: Right. It all comes down to one word, really. (clears throat) Family. Right, before I was a part of this group, I had no family. Pike took me in, I met all of you. And I had a purpose. So before that, I would be down to fuck anything up, anytime, no problem. I still kind of am. But I realized that if I fly off the handle too soon, it screws over my family. That's no good, because I care about you. Most of you. (laughter)
Travis: You're going to get yours. It's coming. And I'm going to help you. And I'm going to high five you when it's done. But until then, you keep that shit tucked inside. Let it build. And then when the time is right, you let her have it. And I'll throw you into the fray, when the time is right.
Marisha: Promise?
Travis: Yeah, I promise.
Marisha: Deal.
Travis: Deal. (cracking noise) (laughter)
Marisha: Ow! Ow, Grog! Grog!
Travis: Oh shit, sorry! I'm so sorry!
Marisha: No, it's fine. I appreciate it. It's good.
Travis: Oh, yeah. Bruises, right?
Liam: She should really take one hit point of damage. (laughter)
Matt: Sure, you take a hit point of damage.
Marisha: Oh man, people are going to ask questions about that later.
Travis: No, it's cool. You make up a really good story.
Marisha: Sure. Yeah.
Travis: But listen. If at any time it gets to be too much, you just go. We've got you.
Marisha: Okay. I don't want to let you guys down.
Travis: You won't.
Marisha: Thanks, Grog. Okay. (clears throat) Let's do this.
Matt: All right. You guys enter the war room, same as it was previously left. However, you are brought the image of the table in early morning: Allura, Gilmore, surprisingly, Drake Thunderbrand, Cassandra, as well as Asum, who's standing behind most of them, back to the window. They all, middle of conversation, turn, and smile as you begin to walk in. You see Gilmore nods to everybody. Gives an extra smile to you, Vax. Cassandra's waiting for the pleasantries to end. Allura comes up and takes your hand, and she goes, "It's wonderful to see that you've returned safely. I've had many terrible thoughts that perhaps this meeting would not be as positive, and I'm very glad to know that I was wrong. And that you brought Kima back to us as well. Pike is safe as well. So congratulations, I guess, are in order. Come, sit. These circumstances do press our timeline a bit." And you see there are a number of other chairs already brought into the room, prepared for you guys to sit around together.
Marisha: Is there anyone sitting next to Raishan?
Matt: No, actually.
Marisha: I sit next to Raishan.
Matt: Raishan is not sitting. Raishan is standing with her arms crossed, leaning against the window.
Laura: I want to stay standing as well.
Marisha: Yeah, I move closer to Raishan.
Matt: Okay. As you approach, you see Asum's eyes watch you. Small grin on the face, and a little nod.
Marisha: I give a nod back.
Taliesin: I pull a chair out for Asum, and I'm going to offer him the chair and sit. And pull one out extra for myself.
Matt: At which point Cassandra gathers all of your attention in the midst of this chaos. "The excursion to Wildemount went well. As far as I understand, you are now one more dragon-slaying into this chaotic endeavor. Well done. Tell me, how did this happen?"
Taliesin: A deal was made with the locals. We brought the dragon to an appointed kill spot outside of the city. We summoned a creature.
Laura: With the Gate scroll that we showed you, actually.
Taliesin: There was a battle. And we felled it. That was more or less how it went down. It was a simple trap, it was elegant, and we barely survived.
Marisha: I pull out the Spire of Conflux and hand it to her. We retrieved this in our spoils. You may recognize it as one of the Vestiges that we spoke of earlier.
Matt: Cassandra takes it and says, "It looks quite important. Allura."
Marisha: Yes, I thought I was handing it to Allura. (laughter)
Marisha: Sorry. It was meant for Allura.
Matt: I can see how this would be confusing.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: You look just like Allura right now.
Laura: Allura, is everything okay? Have you been through some shit, Allura?
Matt: "It's been a rough week." (laughter)
Matt: I almost did Allura, too. Next Halloween.
Liam: Vax is leaning against the door to this chamber, by the way.
Matt: All right. Allura takes it, inspects it. "This is a magnificent artifact. Well found. Perhaps we'll take a look at it after the meeting together."
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: Cassandra gets everyone's attention once more, motions to the guards. The door that you're leaning by gets closed as the guards step out, so it's only you guys having this conversation. "So, with another of the Conclave fallen, retaliation is imminent. And with Thordak already infuriated at the death of Umbrasyl, and we only caught but a glance of that anger, thankfully through the means of which Allura and Gilmore and others were able to cloak the city, I do not feel that will last the entirety of the time we would need to take a leisurely stroll through our next series of plans. I fear that less protected cities may be in the path of retaliation before it finds its way to us." Allura speaks up at this point and goes, "Thordak is a creature of infinite pride. And a slight such as this against the Conclave will most likely trigger the destruction of even more innocents. Both to satiate his anger and, I'm certain, to also draw us out. He is an intelligent one, as is the company he keeps. I've also reached out to other members of the Arcana Pansophical, and hope that they would come to our aid, but given the recent death of Vorugal, I do not know if they'll arrive in time to be of any assistance. So we have to begin to gather our strengths, our allies. And honestly, I think we need to strike first."
Travis: You do?
Matt: "Well, otherwise we wait for the fight to be on Thordak's turf."
Travis: That's unexpected.
Laura: Just pop on over to Emon, then?
Matt: "Well, we need a plan first. We need to gather those we've called to arms. We need to assess what strengths we have, and utilizing all of these things at our disposal, come up with an idea of how we're actually going to do this." Gilmore steps in and goes, "If we are to strike, I agree it should also be very soon. We've pushed the boundaries of being on his peripheral even this long. And you say that he knows your faces, correct?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "His gaze will now surely fall upon the seven of you, at the very least."
Taliesin: It was inevitable.
Matt: Asum steps forward at this point, from the wall, and begins to walk in front of you, Keyleth, and between Percy, "The longer he remains as well, the more the landscape of Emon and the surrounding Bladeshimmer Shoreline begins to churn. Begins to boil with flame and toxic fume. He is scarring the surrounding land with his claws, his teeth, his flames, his roar, and those that follow in his shadow. His fearmongering has risen a number under him. A creature of such pride is eager to show that if you fall in such fear and do as he says, there are rewards. I'm sure you've come across many weak-willed individuals in your travels that would be eager to jump at the chance of working beneath such a powerful and dangerous creature." Allura steps in at this point now and says, "Now I believe it is partially his essence, but the expedited rate of this elemental transition around him is based on the soul anchor that we embedded within him to keep him in the Fire Elemental Plane. This stone that resides in the center of his chest and belly. I believe this stone is somehow drawing elements of the essence of the Fire Elemental Plane itself into Emon. I mean, it's not unusual for the presence of a red dragon over hundreds of years to begin to convert the scenery around, but this speed... I can only see a connection between the enchantment that we hoped would hold Thordak at bay, and the changes we're seeing at the center of Emon and beyond. Now, it was never intended for him to leave that place, and I feel deeply responsible for many elements of the danger we now see in this world. I only know that I will do whatever it takes on my end to see that this comes to an end. Whatever sacrifice, whatever is necessary. I'm at your disposal. But the responsibility of the destruction is also our own. The longer we take, the more chance he will tear through Kymal. He will tear through Westruun. He will tear through Daxio. He will begin to burn everything that Tal'Dorei is, until we show our faces."
Liam: I am curious what the Master of Secrets thinks. Asum?
Matt: Asum is still walking a circle around the table.
Liam: What do you propose we do?
Matt: "Hmph. Well, before we get to that, let us discuss things we have at our disposal, the information we have, and from that, we can garnish a plan. I am the Master of Secrets; I am not a Master of Warmongering and Attack."
Taliesin: I get up, I walk to the window, and I look out the window. We're not going to be safe here for much longer, that much is certain. We will need to move quickly.
Matt: Drake speaks up for the first time and goes, "Aye, not to mention that slippery green drake is still out there somewhere, and we have no idea where it is. Two members of the Conclave are remaining."
Travis: Well-- Ow! Right, yeah. Two.
Taliesin: Do you think perhaps it's best to skip one and hope for the element of surprise? Maybe he thinks we're going to finish off his generals before we come to him. It may be a brief moment of surprise. If anything, maybe he's expecting us to kill one more, not go for the main prize.
Liam: Cut off the head of the king?
Taliesin: Maybe.
Sam: Thordak, from what I understand, is extremely powerful and influential. That Raishan dragon is a mere pittance in comparison. A small, exponential ant, a pawn, if you will, on the battlefield.
Matt: "I certainly hope so. And if that's the case, then I think you're right. Go for the king first. But we must do so with eyes all about us because the last thing we need is to be flanked by that beast in the center of our attack."
Marisha: Exactly. We don't want to deal with two ancient dragons.
Taliesin: Can we lure it somewhere else, perhaps?
Matt: "If we knew where it fucking was." Allura speaks up at this point and goes, "Look. I know that Thordak's hate for me still burns, hence the reason why they went directly for my tower when they first arrived in Emon. The one trump card we do have in this is me."
Laura: Do you want to offer yourself as bait?
Matt: "If need be. I'm not saying that's the right plan, but I'm saying it is one thing we can perhaps utilize in our plan, in our strategy."
Travis: Is his hate for you?
Taliesin: I think-- There was a ship in Draconia, a northern ship of some kind. I still feel there may be some sort of weapon inside it that may prove useful. It was a ship that had been dragged there by the white dragon. It's been bothering me. And then of course we have whatever it is we have downstairs. I'm not saying we should use it, but it is powerful.
Laura: I don't know how we would use it.
Travis: We can't move it, can we?
Laura: We can't touch it.
Matt: Gilmore pops up again and says, "Exactly. We were poring over that thing for a number of weeks, until we had to build this barrier. And to be perfectly honest, I am sick of it."
Liam: You've got nothing?
Matt: "Well, we understand it's a siphon. It's bringing the energy of the nexus somewhere. We don't know where the other end of it is. Or if it's even functioning properly."
Marisha: Allura, do you still feel a connection with the soul stone that's inside of Thordak?
Matt: "Well, I have no personal connection to it, I know that I was the architect of its enchantment, and the ruse, of which sealed it within Thordak."
Marisha: You built it. You must know of some way to disable it.
Travis: Or a weakness.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "We designed it to have no weakness. The intent was to keep him there indefinitely. Perhaps if we could--"
Marisha: What?
Matt: "Asum. You said you have friends, back in Emon still, that have been gathering intel." Asum turns. "Yes, actually. And I was hoping that, as part of our plan today, we could even go and retrieve some of this information. Perhaps that could teach us more about this soul anchor you continuously talk about."
Sam: How can we retrieve this information without going to Emon?
Matt: "Oh, we would have to go to Emon."
Sam: That sounds crazy. Is there any way to not do that?
Matt: "Perhaps I'll go alone."
Marisha: The soul stone has been broken and abused before. I have a feeling there's someone who might have an idea on how to disable it.
Travis: I really don't, I have no idea.
Marisha: Well, Raishan was the one who busted out Thordak in the first place, out of the Fire Plane. So I would assume that Raishan has some idea on how to--
Travis: Oh.
Laura: You think? I feel like Raishan would only know how to open up a portal.
Marisha: Well, I have a lot of feelings about Raishan.
Matt: Cassandra speaks up and says, "Well, you've been abroad. You've been gaining arms and allies, from what you've told me from across Exandria. Let us consolidate our options, our strengths, and plop it down in front of the Conclave, best we can."
Sam: I'm no master strategist, but we do have allies that we can call upon, and weapons, and men and arms and troops. However, taking the fight to Thordak in Emon seems foolhardy at best. I suppose this is where the intelligence could come into play. Is there some other place where we could go and try to take back from Thordak, to lure him away from Emon?
Matt: Asum steps into the conversation and goes, "The thing with that plan is Thordak has amassed thousands of lizardfolk in Emon at this point that follow his whim. In the nearby mountain ranges, many from the Stormcrest, that worshipped him the entire time that he was gone. Wyvern riders originally aided in taking the city that you met, as did I. But since, other allies have found their way to the Cinder King's sway. Last that I checked, it seemed that there were a number of allies that he brought over from his time in the Fire Plane as well."
Laura: What?!
Matt: "Fire giants, in the service of the dragon, now walk the streets."
Sam: So, if we go into Emon, we're facing fire giants, lizard people, and that's before we get to Thordak the Cinder King?
Laura: How the fuck are we going to fight him?!
Matt: "That's what we're discussing today."
Sam: Does Thordak covet any other territory, or city, or town? Vasselheim? Here? Anywhere that we can lure him to?
Travis: Anything he has nostalgic feelings about? Glintshore--
Liam: Anything that would piss him off?
Matt: "You were lucky to draw a creature of such infinitesimal experience and intelligence as a white dragon away from its home roost. I would be greatly surprised if you had pulled a great, powerful, intelligent, ancient red dragon from its home turf advantage."
Liam: So your prediction is that we have to slog our way through the outskirts of Emon to fight him on his home turf. Is that about the size of it?
Matt: "That's one way."
Sam: What's another?
Matt: "Distract his allies and go straight for the heart. You have allies, like Allura just said, all throughout the world."
Travis: This is true. We have the Herd, we can go get the werewolves.
Sam: The Ravenites would help.
Marisha: Everyone who we ask, everyone who we send in there, we're sending in to their death.
Taliesin: This is war.
Travis: Yeah, but it's either death now or death a little later.
Laura: We're sending ourselves as well.
Liam: So, are we talking about sending everyone we know and everything we have to the outskirts of town--
Sam: For a full frontal attack. While we bamf into the dragon's lair.
Liam: Yeah. We create a massive fucking clusterfuck on the edge of his periphery and we go for the center.
Laura: How long did it take you, Allura, to create that heart?
Matt: "Well. The design and the development and enchantment of it are powerful enough to anchor itself to the soul of a dragon of Thordak's strength. Better part of six months."
Liam: Six months.
Laura: Six months.
Liam: We've probably got a week or two.
Matt: "And that was with a dozen other hands helping me. Most of the Arcana Pansophical was at my side for that and we don't have that kind of time."
Liam: Well, we take a day or two and we amass every heavy fucking hitter we have, and we do this. What other choice do we have?
Marisha: I keep thinking back to Emon where we watched half of our friends die in a second.
Liam: A lot of us are going to die.
Matt: Cassandra sits up a little bit in her seat and goes, "If we are smart about this, we can minimize the casualties far more now than they would be a week, two weeks, a month, a year from now."
Travis: I agree.
Taliesin: What of Whitestone? We put the city at great risk. How much risk are we willing to take?
Liam: Percy, everywhere is at great risk right now.
Marisha: It's true.
Travis: We should leave Whitestone.
Sam: But even getting to Emon, aren't we exposing ourselves to detection and attack?
Travis: We are if we wait.
Sam: We're going to march several armies across the entire continent to get there? It'll take days.
Laura: How do we get armies there?
Liam: We're going to take a day or two. We're going to figure out how to get who we have to where we need. We're not doing this tomorrow. In a couple of days. Three days. Four days at the most. It's not ideal, but it's what we have to do.
Sam: We can at least move people to, you know. Where's that town that was established?
Travis: Outside of Westruun?
Matt: There's Westruun, Kymal were the two that you moved--
Sam: Westruun is close-ish, right, to Emon?
Matt: Westruun's a little bit further than Kymal is. Kymal is where you sent a lot of the Westruun refugees.
Travis: Right.
Laura: But they're just townsfolk.
Sam: But we can at least assemble there, from all the different territories, and then meet up, form a plan, and then march from there.
Laura: March on Emon? If we gather our forces, Thordak will notice.
Travis: Yeah, we've got to do a lot of recon before then. But I think he's got a good point, right? We've got to have like a staging point.
Matt: Cassandra turns, looks over to Asum and goes, "Recon, actually. Anything else, Asum, you may have in regards to what we can expect there?" Asum is still slowly walking around the peripheral of the meeting table. "I can tell you that most of the city's wealth and resources, as well as caches, sealed arcane relics, and weaponry, long held by the Lyceum or the arms of Emon, have been stolen and thrown atop the victory hoard of Thordak. Most who are part of this rebellion within the city are doing so with scraps. That is why the Clasp has been so instrumental in the removal of many of the oppressed folk within the city. Also, the fire that marks Thordak's presence that have drawn fire and molten rock across the city, as well as the outskirts of the city walls, scar the landscape and fill the sky with sulfurous clouds and black smoke. The good news is that smoke can be utilized, should someone have some control over the elements, to be a screen. However, where the Cloudtop District once stood, there is now but a heated cauldron of glowing stone and flame. Hundreds of gifts and statues left in Thordak's image litter the outer area, while a massive cavern dives beneath the central region of the district. Now this cavern, as we've watched it, we believe it to be the location of Thordak's treasure vault. As well as the occasional sleeping place of the massive drake we speak of. Thordak is also showing rather intense signs of physical change since being released from his prison. And his size still remains enormous by comparison. His eyes now burn with a searing white light. Burning stars in the sky. His jaw ever dribbles with burning liquid that blackens the ground it touches. The gaps between scales appear to flare bright with each breath, like a star engine beneath the scales."
Marisha: (sneezes) Sorry.
Laura: Bless you.
Marisha: Yeah. Sorry.
Laura: Do you think it's overtaking him?
Matt: "I've no idea. Allura?" And Allura goes, "Well, if the anchor was indeed removed from the Fire Elemental Plane, then Thordak would have had his soul torn from his body. That is how the anchor worked."
Marisha: So you don't think he actually even fully separated from the plane, he brought the plane with him.
Matt: "Or at least, maybe a piece. I wasn't there, I don't know the ritual that brought him over."
Marisha: Maybe then we're looking at this the wrong way. Maybe we go at this through the Fire Plane. Maybe there's something still there.
Taliesin: A way to sever his connection to the Fire Plane, maybe.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Allura thinks for a second.
Marisha: We've got an easy door in.
Matt: "I could try. But the enchantment itself-- We don't have enough information. It wasn't bound to a specific place in the plane, it was bound to the plane itself. I don't know how you'd sever it from the other side."
Travis: From the other side, we'd have to go there.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: That's called thinking outside the circle.
Sam: But then once we're there, what do we do?
Marisha: And we don't even know where to look. I mean, we could at least talk to the Ashari there. They might--
Taliesin: Another ally.
Travis: Is there like nothing friendly in the Fire Plane?
Liam: It's at least as big as Tal'Dorei. I mean, it's another dimension.
Laura: It's huge.
Marisha: It's huge, but not many people know the whereabouts. There's still locations and destinations within the Fire Plane. It's navigable.
Laura: Maybe all the evil things in the Fire Plane are gone right now and they're with Thordak.
Matt: Asum steps forward to the table, and puts his little halfling hands on the edge and goes, "Well, it's a shame that we don't have any information about this ritual that freed him from the plane."
Laura: That is a shame. A real shame.
Matt: "I'll see if my compatriots can gather information, but in the meantime we'll do the best we can to gather similar information."
Liam: Well, we know we don't have a lot of time, but do we maybe want to table this and think on it?
Sam: At the very least, should we send out some letters, alerting our allies that--
Laura: Shit's going down.
Sam: It's time to start stocking up and getting ready to move?
Matt: Drake steps forward and goes, "I think that's a fine plan of action. Reach out to all those you brought in. Hopefully we can get a few of our friends in this as well."
Laura: Did an airship ever arrive?
Matt: They all look at each other, a bit confused. "No."
Laura: An airship? Did anyone see an airship flying around?
Matt: "I didn't see one." And Cassandra goes, "No. There hasn't been an airship here, no. Are we expecting one?"
Laura: Mm-hmm.
Matt: "Good to know."
Sam: The city is invisible.
Matt: "Yes, so they won't see us if they come. If we see an airship, do you wish us to flag it down?"
Laura: That would be good.
Matt: "You trust it?"
Laura: Yes.
Liam: They are a rarity.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: Maybe come up with a landing point as well.
Matt: "Now?"
Sam: Well, soon.
Taliesin: We have one other possible option in front of us. Show them the medal.
Sam: No, thank you.
Taliesin: You're not going to show them the medal? Not that, no! No, not that. Please don't whip that out, no one wants to see that.
Sam: No, not the cube.
Taliesin: We have another ally that we have spoken of.
Sam: It's a tenuous ally at best. Maybe we shouldn't discuss it until we're 100% sure about it.
Liam: Yeah, that's a big maybe. That's a big maybe. Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, they're very busy though.
Laura: Yeah, it's really far away and, then as we were leaving, the people that we talked to about it--
Matt: "It's fine, I get it! Reach out to your people on one end."
Taliesin: I slowly walk around the table, thinking hard about it. And I stab Seeker Asum three times in the back with my sword.
Marisha: Let's fucking do this shit! Let's do it! Let's do it!
Laura: But we need to know the ritual!
Liam: It's too late, he did it.
Marisha: (yelling) Yeah!
Sam: Oh Percy, no.
Matt: Go ahead and roll--
Taliesin: That's a surprise attack.
Matt: I know it is.
Sam: Oh god, why? We're in crazy costumes.
Liam: Check out the brain on Brad.
Laura: We've got Allura and Gilmore, and Drake.
Taliesin: We have a lot of people in the room.
Sam: Oh god.
Matt: Go ahead and roll. Roll the first attack. With advantage.
Travis: We're in a room.
Laura: Whitestone's about to be destroyed.
Sam: And Raishan's about to leave.
Liam: Oh man, he's not making you roll stealth, motherfucker.
Laura: Why would he? He doesn't--
Liam: Because I would. And Hotis did on me.
Laura: That's different.
Liam: No it's not.
Taliesin: That's 29.
Matt: Okay. As you pull the blade out of the hilt to go ahead and begin to strike-- You're a quick individual. You're also in the presence of an entity that does not trust anyone or anything. You take the blade and swing out in the direction of Seeker Asum. And where your blade strikes, it shimmers through the image. There's a flash, and Asum is suddenly four feet away from the position where Asum was standing. At which point, everyone in the room stands up immediately and is like, "Whoa whoa!" Cassandra goes over and puts her hand towards you, and Asum is taking a few steps back and is like (breathes heavily).
Taliesin: No tricks in here. No tricks in here, if we're really going to do this.
Matt: There's this moment of extreme quiet, tension, as Allura's looking at you, looking at Asum, looking around. And there's like this slow, connecting moment of realization throughout the room as everyone's eyes go wide.
Taliesin: If we're really going to do this, no tricks in here.
Matt: And with that, we're going to take a break. (screaming)
Marisha: Amazing!
Laura: Taliesin!
Taliesin: Don't trust a man who just kissed somebody! That's a man who's saying fuck it.
Liam: Backpedal, backpedal, backpedal!
Marisha: I'm into it. I'm really into it.
Liam: Yes, we know, darling. We know.
Matt: All righty. Well, we'll go ahead and take a short break here, guys. We'll be back here in a few minutes. And we'll (Victor voice) see what happens next! (normal voice) All right. See you guys here in a minute. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role. When we last left off, Clarota, over here-- Let us all marvel at that! (cheering)
Taliesin: It was me all along!
Laura: Oh god. Are you going to leave that on the whole time?
Taliesin: Oh hell no! I can't see or hear a thing.
Marisha: It was so short-lived.
Liam: Three seconds of costume, that's all you get! (laughter)
Sam: You can't put just this part on?
Taliesin: No, it's really uncomfortable!
Laura: Just the helmet?
Liam: Do the frigging helmet. I had my arm behind my back for two hours!
Taliesin: Why would you do that?
Liam: Commitment!
Marisha: I have so many guns in my belt! No one can even see them, and I'm still committed.
Sam: I painted my entire body.
Taliesin: What is wrong with you people?
Laura: That's good. You're good now.
Taliesin: I can't really claim sanity. I just did something mind-bendingly stupid.
Liam: You now look like one of your own bullets. (laughter)
Matt: You have a very Merlin from Excalibur thing going on there right now.
Taliesin: A dream to some, a nightmare to others. (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh, like lightning! Yes!
Matt: We need more green lights in here to really get the effect.
Taliesin: Go see Excalibur. Not right now, but tomorrow.
Matt: All right! So, bringing it back in. As your blade swings through and passes through the form of Seeker Asum, it shimmers and then darts backward into the corner of the room.
Taliesin: I immediately sheath and say  No more tricks. If we're going to do this, we need everybody to know what's on the table.
Matt: At which point, everyone who stood up and held off at the chaos, you see all the faces going off in realization. Asum goes from a defensive position and then stands up again. Crosses the arms.
Taliesin: We're either going to win, or we're not. I was hoping you were going to take care of that.
Matt: "We're working on that plan as we speak. But pardon me if I take a few-- how do you say-- careful backups in case one would take a blade and stab at an ally, supposedly."
Taliesin: You know damn well that we're not allies. You know damn well that this is a tenuous relationship. And you know that neither of us trust the other.
Matt: At which point, Allura puts her hand out and goes, "I'm sorry. What the hell is going on here?!"
Taliesin: We'll get there. I would hope that you wouldn't trust us, and I would hope that you understand that we don't trust you. But we need to make a real plan now.
Matt: As the tension slowly subsides, Gilmore puts his finger up, "Pardon my momentary ignorance. Would you like me to cleanse the room?"
Taliesin: I'm hoping for a conversation to start that I promised I wouldn't start myself. I am trying to keep to the letter of my word.
Sam: It might help if Gilmore were to make sure everyone is on the up-and-up in this room.
Taliesin: Seeker Asum, do you have an opinion on how you would like to proceed?
Matt: Seeker Asum takes a few steps towards you. Casually looks up to you and goes to pat you on the shoulder. His illusory hand passing through your form. Goes, "I'm quite comfortable where I am right now. Let us continue this conversation."
Taliesin: The floor is yours if you wish to tell everyone what the real plan is.
Matt: "Very well! Since my hand has been forced. Hello. Seeker Asum is still back in Emon, dealing with the difficulty of preparing the current circumstance we're discussing. I am Raishan. Member of the Conclave. Up until recently, tenuous ally with Thordak the Cinder King, who is now considered a mutual thorn in all of our sides. I've made an agreement with your Vox Machina for quite some time. Together, using our combined strengths, we slew Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, over in Wildemount. We've returned to reconvene. I've provided nothing but honest, upfront, and necessarily vital information to your victory."
Taliesin: I will confirm everything but "for quite some time" to the room.
Laura: I've just been staring at Allura.
Matt: Allura, you see her fingers are twitching and her arms tense, and there's this very faint air that's blowing her hair ever so slightly, where there's no wind in the air. She's on edge right now and is looking to you guys for guidance, like "Are we doing this?" Cassandra stood up immediately. For the first time in a long time, since Whitestone was reclaimed, Cassandra now resembles more her age than she ever did. She has a look on her face like she's far out of her depth. Understanding the circumstance, there's legitimate fear in her face, and she's looking at Percival with that look of, "What have you done?"
Taliesin: Now we can have a real conversation about what's going on. We have an ally on the inside, albeit an untrustworthy one. You'll pardon that, but there's every possibility that this is an elaborate trap. I respect your intelligence far too much to try and pretend otherwise. You understand certainly what I mean? Having this on the table, we now know that there's every possibility that the red dragon knows everything. There's every possibility that we're walking into a trap. Or there's every possibility that we have an insatiably powerful ally. It is a terrible risk.
Marisha: Or an insatiably powerful enemy.
Taliesin: Also a terrible risk.
Laura: Either way, we can now ask about the ritual.
Marisha: Why don't you inform the room on how you utilized an entire race of people to break the ritual?
Matt: Everyone's still standing at this point, looking. Cassandra slowly sits down but is still looking between Raishan and Percival. You watch as Asum's form steps towards the center of the room, the flash of green flaring in the eyes with a smile, "The anchor that you speak of was indeed removed from the Fire Elemental Plane. We discovered that it was indestructible. Good on you, Allura. Well created. We tried many different ways: rending it, crushing it, sending it elsewhere without the enchantment tearing Thordak with it. To no avail. In trying to find a way to bring Thordak through, we needed to bring the soul anchor and the Fire Elemental Plane with it. The one place where such research could be gathered promptly, fully, was Pyrah. Now, mind you, it was not my intent for such destruction to rain upon them. I spent many years with them. I got to know them. They're a fine people. In that time, I learned the ways of temporal travel between dimensions. The details that allowed me to see the fabric of the Fire Plane, to where we could encase a bit of it within the soul anchor itself. Once we had managed to crack that essence, I was able to, from a distance, using the allies at the other end-- Thordak had found friendship with some of the ousted fire giants. They found comfort outside of the ordning under the shadow of the fire dragon. In using their deep, rich-blooded past and forging and making, they were able to convert the soul anchor into something that housed the essence of the Fire Plane. However, we didn't have a means of creating a hole large enough to bring both through without destroying both in the process. And as such, we waited for the right time: The Winter's Crest."
Marisha: You bitch.
Matt: "To some, maybe. But we called this the Ember Seed. The Ember Seed resides in the center of this heartstone. That is what is causing Thordak to swell. That is what's driving him mad. That is what is drawing the very land around Emon to fiery eruption. It is also what keeps his soul on this plane."
Travis: What keeps his soul on this plane?
Matt: "It keeps the soul intact with his body."
Travis: Destroy the stone...
Taliesin: It can't be destroyed.
Matt: "In theory. But we've tried. Believe me; we've tried."
Marisha: And you kept the soul and the stone inside of him?
Matt: "To remove it would destroy him as well, as the Arcana Pansophical saw fit. So yes, both came through. Waited for the Winter's Crest, had enough power and understanding of the ritual to open the entirety of the tear, and Thordak screamed through, flames in his wake. And he laid waste to your people, not I."
Marisha: No. You used me. You used us. And my fear that I had originally appears to be true. A lot of this is my fault. I'm willing to accept my onus. The fact that you can't shows all the kind of person that you are. My promise still stands. I'm thinking it might come sooner rather than later.
Matt: "You do understand that without my aid, you will not succeed?"
Marisha: I understand that without your aid, none of this would have fucking happened in the first place.
Matt: "Yes, and there are quite a few in this room that fall in that category." She looks to Allura and Drake.
Marisha: So it seems all of us can accept our part in this matter, except for you.
Matt: "I accept my part in this matter as well. You don't think I feel duped by this? You don't think I have many things I wish to tear from the very corpse of that entity? You think I don't want to see him burn as much as you do? This vengeance that burns within me!"
Marisha: What would you do if you actually got what you want?
Matt: "What all of us want  freedom."
Marisha: I pull out the Spire of Conflux. There are always many solutions to many problems. You think Thordak is the only solution to yours? This staff was birthed from the head of Melora, the same goddess who gave you that curse. What if you wanted me instead? Me and this staff. Maybe I can help you more than Thordak can.
Matt: "Are you saying you understand the way to remove this? That you know the secret to burning this wretched disease from my form?"
Marisha: I'm saying I might be your best chance at salvation. I'm pretty sure this staff is the closest living relic that we have in existence to the god who granted your curse. Thordak is no god. That was your first stupid mistake.
Taliesin: I think if I might translate. What my friend here is trying to relate is that, perhaps when the dust has settled, your salvation may either be found in the withering corpse or cackling smile of a creature that you are subservient to, who will take great delight in your destruction. Or perhaps in those you've aided who will feel grateful.
Marisha: It's up to you, Raishan.
Taliesin: And I will advise her to take no revenge until all cards are on the table.
Matt: "Well. Good."
Marisha: Clearly you are the type of person who looks for answers in other people. You are clearly unaware of accepting any fault or any result of your actions. Why don't you start fresh? Do you really want Thordak to have another sway over you? Another gift, another favor, that he's given you? That he is going to hold over you for all of eternity? Do you really want that? You're stronger than that.
Matt: "That's why we're working to watch him fall."
Marisha: Are we?
Matt: (chuckles) "If you need not my help, just let me know."
Marisha: Oh no, Raishan. We don't need your help. Let me say that right now. This all depends on what you want out of the end of the deal.
Matt: "I wish to be given unfettered, unbothered, unwatched control over the corpse upon his death to extract the information I need. I will leave your very sphere of existence and understanding until the end of your days."
Liam: What happens if we say no to that?
Matt: "Oh, then I'll find another way."
Marisha: Spoiler alert  we're saying no to that.
Taliesin: Unfettered I'm fine with. It's unwatched--
Matt: "Then watch! Watch, for all I care. It will be Greek to you anyway."
Marisha: She's taken way too much. She doesn't get to leave!
Taliesin: She's already left.
Travis: Yeah, I walk over around the table towards Asum. I try and poke her in the shoulder. Him.
Matt: It passes through the form.
Taliesin: This is the deal that we are offered. This is the deal that's on the table. We are in a tenuous position of power.
Sam: You can stop poking, Grog.
Travis: She's not here!
Laura: That's crazy.
Sam: Give her one more good poke.
Taliesin: How do we get in contact with you when we know when we move and how?
Matt: "Well, what is your next step through your journey?"
Taliesin: That is the question. Now that everything's on the table, I'm sorry to shock everyone. I was hoping not to be the cause of it. I was hoping that it was time for everything to be on the table. But this is actually what we're dealing with. This is the complexity. This is the battlefield.
Travis: So we have to rally our forces to us, and we have to do some really smart recon. Do we make her a part of that or no?
Taliesin: No, the more distance that we keep, the better.
Sam: From her?
Taliesin: Yes. She will probably be, I imagine, in our way on occasion.
Liam: But no one make any mistake. She's lying to our faces. She is not telling us what she wants or what she wants to do. You have a whole plan!
Matt: "Assume what you will."
Liam: Shut the fuck up! You've been droning on for an hour! Shut the fuck up. You're not telling us what you want. You fucking shit bag. Fuck you!
Matt: "Keep great company."
Liam: Does anyone really believe that this is all going to be fixed if we work with her?
Marisha: I say we take a recess. Gather our thoughts. Raishan, my offer still stands. If you want to come and find me, I know you know how. Maybe we can commune with Melora together.
Matt: "You do not comprehend the magics that you even speak of. It's cute. Look, I agree. Distance is of aid to us at the moment. If anything, I should probably cut off the information of Vorugal's fall. I should speak with the Cinder King and still establish my allegiance from his perspective."
Taliesin: Can you cut off that information? I would imagine that would be far too much.
Matt: "Cut it off, no. But I can attempt to guide the fury, if you will."
Laura: Will he know it was us?
Matt: "I can guarantee it."
Travis: Can you keep him from attacking Whitestone?
Matt: "For a time, maybe."
Marisha: Can you guide his fury in a way that would be beneficial to the plan?
Matt: "If I knew what the plan was, yes."
Marisha: You were saying ideally, if we could get him away?
Taliesin: I don't think we're going to get him away--
Sam: We're going to do recon. We're going to send out word to gather our forces-- where?
Taliesin: What if he knew where we were?
Travis: We don't know yet.
Sam: Let's find out, let's pick a place.
Taliesin: What if you knew where we were? What if we found a place? We pick our battleground. He discovers where we're hiding.
Marisha: And Raishan rats us out.
Taliesin: And Raishan discovers this information.
Marisha: Would certainly put you in the good graces of the Cinder King.
Matt: Raishan takes a moment and thinks.
Taliesin: You are searching for us right now, are you not?
Matt: "I am indeed, but Thordak has been using us as the attack."
Liam: Yeah, he's not going to leave his nest.
Laura: So what if we kill you?
Matt: "What do you mean?"
Laura: How does Thordak know you're alive?
Matt: "Because I check in every now and then to remind him."
Laura: What if he sends you out, and we kill you?
Marisha: And you never come back? He'd be forced to be the one to have to leave the battlefield.
Taliesin: If he knew where you were headed.
Marisha: You're a clever girl. I'm sure you can make a ruse to make you look convincingly dead.
Taliesin: You wouldn't even have to tell us where you were hiding. You could just hide. And we could ready ourselves.
Matt: "That is an idea. Hmm. Take your recess. I'll take mine. There may be something to this plot."
Marisha: And we can all assume that when we exit this room, that our tenuous alliance is still that. Correct?
Matt: "I would hope that there's no more errant blade pokery?"
Taliesin: Now that I know your tricks.
Laura: We do it to everyone. Don't worry.
Taliesin: We actually do, now that I think about it.
Marisha: Yeah, that's kind of true.
Liam: We're also not alone here. Allura, how does this sit with you?
Matt: Allura is sitting right now, she's listening to everything with her hands crossed. Shakes her head and goes, "To be perfectly honest, this bothers me a great deal. But the fact that Whitestone still stands does speak volumes at the least."
Taliesin: It does.
Matt: "With the cards being in our favor."
Taliesin: It's not the first devil I've made a deal with.
Matt: "No."
Laura: Doesn't always turn out well, Percival.
Taliesin: Doesn't always turn out terribly, either.
Matt: "Regardless, I have a lot to think about. As do we all." And Allura slowly turns her head and looks up, probably for the first time since she sat down, to the illusory Raishan's Asum form. "Asum lives, then?" "Indeed he does. Indeed he does." And Allura turns her head back and goes--
Marisha: Can I do an insight check?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Does she know if Asum is up to something no good? 25, I think? Better double check that. 25.
Matt: 25? Okay. It's hard to read the demeanor of Raishan in general. It's this middle ground of neutral expression with a half-cocked grin. Information flows at this consistent rate of being generally difficult to read. The beat of hesitation is meant for emphasis, more than covering, if that makes any sense. So it seems to have an honesty to it, if you could read any honesty from Raishan.
Laura: Raishan, now that we know you're you, do you have to continue the ruse of being Asum, or can you bring him here?
Matt: "I can certainly bring him here if you'd like. However, he is doing quite a lot of good with the Clasp, and Brom and Tofor underneath Emon right now, and they've managed to save many lives and continue to do so."
Laura: Maybe you could pop him over then? Just for a little bit.
Matt: "Well--"
Laura: You're quite powerful.
Matt: "What do you have need for Asum?"
Laura: I want to hear what's going on with the Clasp. I want to see for myself that he's alive.
Taliesin: We're actually going to have to have a conversation with the Clasp, because we're going to purge the city once the dragon is gone.
Matt: "Why don't you go see him yourself?"
Travis: No, I like her idea. I want to see him here.
Liam: Yeah. I feel a little better here. It would go a long way to earning some trust.
Matt: "Well, make your choice. Either I intercept and begin to work towards Thordak's ruse and set a space that convinces him perhaps I've fallen into your hands, or I go retrieve your friend from Emon. I'm not your errand boy, and we have a limited time here. Which is more important?"
Travis: Sure you are. You are our errand boy. We are your vessel to what it is you want. So get busy, and do it quickly. After all, you're very powerful. But that changes day by day, doesn't it?
Matt: "So, Emon it is. Very well. Back in a day."
Taliesin: We will start figuring out and discussing a place for the final battle. We will find a place that is advantageous. Your input, if you feel the urge to give it, is always welcome. At least to me.
Matt: "It's going to be very difficult to pry the Cinder King from his nest."
Taliesin: Your supposed death will go far for that.
Matt: "If anything, but I have no guarantees."
Taliesin: As long as everything is on the up and up, and as long as we do not catch you in deep deceit.
Liam: (whispers) Good luck with that.
Taliesin: We will make sure that the plan moves in the direction it is meant to.
Matt: "One day then."
Travis: One day.
Matt: And the image (disappearing noise).
Taliesin: He's going to send Asum to us.
Travis: So Allura, so it's clear  Seeker Asum is Raishan.
Taliesin: And has been since Raishan's appearance in Whitestone.
Marisha: And we didn't know until 48 hours ago? Tops?
Taliesin: Now, can we maybe make sure that everybody in the room is who they say they are?
Sam: Go stab everyone, Percy. One at a time.
Matt: As you say that, everyone pulls back from the table.
Laura: I'm a dragon too! (evil laugh)
Liam: Hi. Larkin.
Matt: There he is!
Taliesin: I apologize. I didn't know what else to do.
Laura: You thought you were going to stab him!
Liam: Yes you did, Percival.
Laura: That was not a play!
Travis: Yeah, let's be real about it. "No tricks in this room!"
Liam: Yeah, you shifted gears very quickly there.
Laura: No tricks.
Taliesin: I've told no lies in this room.
Liam: Uh-huh.
Travis: (fake cough) Whiff!
Taliesin: I tell that creature no lies. Ever. That is a green dragon. There is no tricking it, there is no deceiving it. There is just telling as much truth as you can get away with.
Matt: As you're talking, you feel a tug on your right arm. And you look over and you see Cassandra, who has come over to your side and is pulling on your sleeve with a very intense look in her eye. She goes, "Percival. I can watch Whitestone. I can get the people fed. I can keep the people armed. I can organize the day to day. I can't keep it safe from that."
Taliesin: Which is why I would ask everyone to please not antagonize it.
Matt: "Percival. Percival! I don't know what you dragged us into in this, but I need you to pull us out of it. I can't do this."
Taliesin: I've moved the battle. That is the best that I know how.
Matt: "How long have you known?"
Taliesin: Two days.
Laura: Not long, Cassandra.
Taliesin: Two days.
Sam: Maybe three.
Marisha: We were forced.
Taliesin: The day before we left to kill the white dragon.
Sam: There's a time difference.
Laura: And if we had told any of you, your life would have been in danger.
Taliesin: This was the best way I knew to keep her from destroying this city outright. This was the best way that kept her from telling the red dragon where we are. And the longer that we can keep her a tenuous ally, the longer Whitestone will stand.
Sam: When she does come back with Asum, this plan that we started in on-- it's a good one?
Taliesin: I think so.
Sam: Well, we have Raishan convince Thordak that we're amassing forces in Kymal or something. Thordak sends Raishan to get us. We "kill" Raishan.
Laura: Mm-hmm.
Sam: And then Thordak comes to check on our dead bodies?
Taliesin: We send word of a dead dragon.
Sam: How can that plan fail?
Liam: I mean, I'm not the only one who thinks she's more dangerous than he is at this point.
Laura: Oh yes. I think if we give her access to Thordak's body afterwards, we're asking for a lot of trouble.
Taliesin: Which is why if Keyleth can figure out a way to cure her of this disease, it takes a big card off the table.
Liam: We've got 24 hours.
Marisha: I have ideas.
Taliesin: We have more than that, because it's going to take quite a while. That's how long we have to make a plan.
Laura: Question. What if we do actually just kill her?
Sam: Raishan?
Laura: When we fake that we're killing her, what if we kill her?
Marisha: Just actually kill her?
Taliesin: She's going to be expecting that, and it will not work.
Travis: And she's super slippery. She just totally like evaded Percy's sneak stabby-stab.
Liam: Is there anyone around right now?
Matt: Oh yeah, no. Allura, Drake--
Liam: 20, natural 20! For perception.
Matt: For perception?
Liam: Yeah. I said, "Is anyone around?" and I rolled a 20.
Matt: You guys are still in the war room.
Liam: I know, but you know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm talking about.
Matt: Oh!
Liam: There it is, it's right there. Invisible fucking Larkin dwarf dragon.
Matt: You don't see anybody else around.
Liam: All right. That's a 20.
Laura: Should we continue this conversation downstairs?
Taliesin: First, is everybody who they say they are? Please, if you would be so kind.
Travis: Oh yeah, Allura. Can we light your sage real quick, make sure everybody's on the up and up?
Matt: Allura sits up and says, "Well, I mean, it makes sense. Asum is the one that requested we not move the war room down to the--"
Taliesin: So why don't we move the war room now?
Matt: "I think that would be the best, yes. Let us all adjourn to the new space at the ziggurat. That should at least keep things honest."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Allura picks her robes up and--
Sam: Grog, your beard might go away.
Laura: (gasps) No!
Travis: No, it's in there.
Taliesin: It just won't grow while he's down there.
Liam: I mean for science, right? Let's go. You look really good without a beard, Grog. I've always thought so.
Travis: You shut up, you. (laughter)
Travis: We can go down there, I don't care.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way down to the ziggurat. The guards come and start carrying chairs and other elements of the war room. Eventually, you're all led down through the tunnels, which have been a little more refined and given an actual more comfortable path past the now-defunct whitestone refinery that the Briarwoods had originally established. You enter the ziggurat room. It has more lighting to it than it previously did. A number of torches now line the walls, the sconces that are lit as the guards progress upward. You can see the reflection to the green glass-like Whitestone material that permeates the outside of the ziggurat. And not right by it, but partially upward there's a small wooden platform that's been where the main base of operations for research and study is here. You see a number of desks set out. It's been built alongside of the large pyramid-type structure. And eventually, you all adjourn up into that space. As you go up there, you all feel a significant drop in enchantment. All of your magical items, all of everything, gradually fades in this space. So, Grog, you actually feel your musculature-- the Titanstone Gauntlets themselves, the effect begins to completely fade back to your classic, Grog-like strength.
Travis: I feel totally fine.
Laura: Are the walls still like people?
Matt: Oh, do you want to go to the top of the ziggurat and check?
Marisha: Oh.
Taliesin: Not yet. After the meeting.
Marisha: Did they have like a clean-up crew down there?
Taliesin: It's a guy on a scaffold with a scrub brush going, "Ew. Ew."
Laura: They're really clean naked bodies now.
Liam: Brush cleaning out the fingernails.
Matt: At this point, they're looking around. Everyone who's journeyed with you towards this new meeting place, the ziggurat, is of the same physicality they were at the meeting room. Any illusions that would have been cast aside or dispelled at this point seem to not be present. So everyone is, by all intents and purposes, who they say they are.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: And this also means it would probably be impossible to scry in this room.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Allura nods. "Yes, actually. Yes."
Taliesin: Excellent. This is where all talk must happen now.
Laura: Where it should have been happening.
Taliesin: So now you know what we've been dealing with for the past 72 hours. She did help with the death of that dragon. In fact, I doubt we would have survived without her aid. She could have very easily left us there to die.
Laura: It's true. She actually revealed her entire form during the battle. Which is quite diseased.
Taliesin: At least it appeared diseased.
Marisha: She's definitely not as strong as the others, but far more clever.
Taliesin: And she knows where we are. And what our plans are. And every inch of this place. Including this thing.
Matt: "Well then, what do you presume we do?"
Sam: We don't really have a choice, we have to work with her to some extent. We can make it hard for her, and we can be assholes to her, and go tell her to get Asum for us. But other than that, we have to work with her.
Liam: What's the benefit of working with her?
Sam: Because if we don't, she can destroy Whitestone whenever she feels like it.
Liam: What if we tell her we're going to fake her death, and then we kill her for real?
Sam: That's fine, if she ever gets close enough for us to kill her.
Taliesin: She's not going to.
Travis: She evaded it really easy.
Sam: Why would she need to come face to face with us in that plan, ever? She could say, "I'm going to go meet them in Kymal. Oh, I died!"
Taliesin: Our best bet is maybe-- hopefully enough of us still have our strength. Maybe at the end if she has been ravaged by the red dragon.
Travis: I agree.
Laura: And then we try to defeat her after that?
Travis: I agree. Our play is the finish line. That's it. Not a moment before.
Laura: But we have to beat her to it. If she gets a hold of that stone--
Marisha: It's what she wants.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Our hope is to break the stone.
Marisha: We can't break the stone.
Taliesin: Only because no one has.
Sam: If we draw Thordak to us, at least we control the battlefield. She could still be lying in wait to pounce on his body the second we kill him.
Liam: If. We have to hope that she's actually going to fight with us. She's done it once. We don't know that she's going to do it again. We don't know.
Marisha: They mentioned moving the stone that shouldn't have been able to have been moved. Correct? They moved it inside of Thordak, and then Thordak left with the stone in him, right?
Taliesin: Yes, which I don't think should have been possible.
Marisha: Right. So how did they do it? Because I'm also looking at another thing that is supposedly immovable.
Laura: Supposedly.
Marisha: Supposedly.
Taliesin: Supposedly.
Taliesin: Oh, it's possible. Nothing is impossible.
Laura: Are you suggesting we put the vortex of doom inside one of us?
Marisha: Kind of, yeah. That's what I was--
Matt: Allura immediately puts her hands up and goes, "No! No. No. No."
Marisha: There's got to be a way to move it.
Sam: To do what, though?
Matt: "This is an absence of magic. It is a void of magic. It is a maw that devours magic. The enchantment that we put within Thordak is pure magic."
Liam: And you've been working on it for months, and you are smarter than us.
Matt: "Well."
Laura: Right. No way to transport it? None at all?
Marisha: It could be the only thing that could break the stone!
Laura: Think about it. If we could get that stone next to the vortex, he'd be fucked.
Matt: "Right! So what, we take a few wooden two by fours and push it along? Look, everything I know, everything I've studied, everything I've spent my entire life working for is useless near that."
Laura: This is a temple to Ioun, right?
Matt: "It was."
Laura: The goddess of knowledge?
Sam: Sure.
Matt: "The only person I know of who rightfully worshipped Ioun was Brom."
Laura: Brom?
Sam: Of the Clasp?
Matt: "Arbiter Brom. He was of the council with us."
Laura: And he's in Emon, potentially?
Matt: "According to Raishan. With Tofor and--"
Laura: Brom's with Asum?
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: What holds it there? It's a shame we can't open a giant door and push it down here.
Marisha: What did you just say?
Taliesin: We can't do it.
Marisha: What? Say it again, one more time?
Taliesin: It's a shame we can't open a giant door and push the dragon in here.
Sam: How on earth could we--?
Taliesin: We couldn't do it. It won't work. Because that side of the door won't open by its very nature. No door can be opened to this room. No one can get in or out without someone walking.
Laura: You couldn't have used the gate scroll in here.
Taliesin: I'm trying to even conceive of a machine that could move this. But I don't understand why it's here in the first place.
Sam: I don't think the secret to defeating Thordak is moving this thing.
Taliesin: It's a shame we couldn't. We have a line in the sand of how close we can get to this thing with magic, correct?
Matt: "This way." And she leads you back down the ziggurat, out to the entrance where you guys entered this large chamber. And about 20 or so meters back, you can see there is a specific wooden support beam that is structured within this tunnel. And on that beam, elements of it are painted black. And she goes, "This is the perimeter in which the siphon devours magic inward."
Marisha: How big is it? How big is it, roughly?
Matt: What, the--?
Marisha: Perimeter.
Matt: "I'd say it'd take a half-mile?"
Marisha: Damn, this place is really big. And it's encased in stone, yeah? Kind of, right? Were we encased in whitestone? Right?
Taliesin: In stone. I've got a terrible idea.
Marisha: Tell me!
Taliesin: What happens to magical creatures when they enter the circle? Have we experimented at all to find out what would happen to a magical creature? A creature whose very essence is magic?
Matt: "I don't know."
Taliesin: (sighs) There's no humane way to do this.
Sam: Sure there is! Kiki, get a fey creature in here.
Laura: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, send him in.
Marisha: Oh yeah, they die and they go right back to their plane.
Sam: No, I think they just die.
Taliesin: And even if they do go back to their plane, they may not be able to in there, they may wither and actually die. I just wanted to put that on the table.
Marisha: Are you trying to make me feel better about any of this?
Taliesin: I don't want to lie to you about this. I've been practicing intense levels of honesty, if not telling the whole truth.
Travis: Sidebar. Do we have all the Vestiges that the sphinx told us about?
Sam: No.
Travis: What else is there?
Sam: There's one in the Fire Plane.
Liam: Something for Pickle.
Marisha: The Dawn Martyr. Dawn Martyr?
Travis: I know I'm not the smartest one in the group, but we don't know what the fuck we're talking about with this little sphere. Why don't we go find that last Vestige and see what it turns up?
Laura: I don't know if we have a lot of time--
Taliesin: We have time. In a day.
Marisha: I mean, only if we--
Taliesin: In a day she returns. We chose a place, we move our forces in there. We have days where she could be looking for us, and then when she disappears it's going to take a day or two for him to really find out. It will be about three to four days before anything actually happens.
Sam: What are we doing, going after this Vestige when-- can any of us even use it?
Marisha: Pike.
Laura: Pike.
Travis: Well, I can. Kima might. I'm not much for poetry, but it seems sort of poetic that Thordak came from the Fire Plane, and the last Vestige we're looking for is in the Fire Plane.
Marisha: Also, we might be able to find some information on the stone.
Laura: This is true.
Sam: The Fire Plane isn't just like Dallas.
Taliesin: It actually is quite like Dallas. I think that's a very reasonable comparison.
Sam: It's a horrible place where we could all die.
Travis: Well, so was the Feywild, and we didn't--
Sam: We're risking our hides for something that might benefit one of us, maybe.
Laura: Well, that's what we've been doing this entire time.
Travis: That's basically all of our choices at this point.
Marisha: We could go in with the rest of the Fire Ashari that are there. We can meet up with Cerkonos. Is this whole ziggurat encased in whitestone?
Matt: The ziggurat itself is built from stone, and then the upper exterior of it is covered in this green glass-like substance that is distilled whitestone residuum.
Taliesin: I have a plan. It will take a little bit of time, but it's vicious.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: It probably wouldn't work. Well, let's find out what happens to a creature inside here before we--
Travis: A regular creature or a Feywild creature?
Marisha: Okay, I actually do have Conjure Woodland Beings.
Laura: That's not a magic creature though, it's a woodland being.
Marisha: No, woodland beings can be like fey creatures.
Laura: Really?
Marisha: Mm-hmm.
Taliesin: Something small.
Travis: Do it! Oh my god, do it!
Laura: Just a fairy. Just a teeny little fairy.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: What level's that? That is--
Marisha: Third level.
Travis: Wait, if you like conjure it outside and walk in, is it going to go poof and disappear?
Laura: Potentially. We'll find out.
Matt: A fourth level, you mean.
Marisha: Sorry, fourth level.
Matt: Yeah, so you can create some fey creatures, yeah. What are you summoning?
Marisha: What makes sense?
Travis: What's going to squeal?
Taliesin: We're on one side of the line. Send it to the other, see what happens.
Marisha: I'll summon a--
Sam: Little pixie!
Marisha: A little-- (stutters) A little pixie.
Laura: (copying Marisha) Lalittle lilittle li-- A little pixie.
Marisha: A lillul lillul pixie.
Sam: Hi, little pixie! Go in that room!
Taliesin: This may be, by the way, how we deal with Raishan.
Marisha: What?
Matt: Okay. So you conjure a pixie?
Marisha: Sure. And I send her in.
Matt: Pixie flies in. Continues to fly in. Nothing happens.
Taliesin: Pixie's fine?
Matt: Pixie seems fine.
Sam: Pixie's not a magical creature, I guess.
Laura: Isn't it, though?
Sam: Has magic, maybe. Isn't a magical being.
Taliesin: Can you make the pixie do something? Try and have the pixie do something magical.
Marisha: Yeah. I have them. Can't they cast like Confusion or something like that? Or can they cast--?
Sam: Polymorph.
Matt: They can cast Confusion, they can cast Polymorph, they can cast things like that.
Marisha: Hey! Try and Polymorph me!
Matt: Pixie turns around and nothing happens.
Marisha: Nothing?
Matt: Pixie looks confused. "What? Sorry."
Taliesin: It's all right, you did very well. How do you feel? Do you feel all right?
Matt: Technically, this pixie--
Travis: Touch it.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of this, sure. There is very basic communication. The pixie is--
Taliesin: Tinkerbell.
Matt: Yeah, Sylvan is the language that it speaks, so it is close enough to Elvish that those who speak Elvish can like interpret elements of it.
Marisha: Oh, I know Sylvan. I know Sylvan. Hey! How do you feel?
Matt: "A little queasy, that's all."
Marisha: Queasy? Yeah?
Matt: "It's weird."
Marisha: Hmm. Hey, will you do me a favor and don't hold it against me?
Taliesin: Why don't you let it leave?
Travis: Just go do it! Just do it!
Marisha: Will you go touch that black orb?
Taliesin: No no no, don't do that!
Travis: Yeah yeah yeah, go touch it. She meant what she said.
Matt: I mean, she's only listening to her, so--
Liam: Yeah, it doesn't matter what Percy says.
Travis: Do it. Fucking do it.
Sam: Let's see if it goes to the other world.
Laura: You don't know where it goes.
Taliesin: That's right, I don't know.
Liam: No, you don't know what she's talking about. It's Esperanto.
Travis: You don't speak Sylvan.
Taliesin: I've already done my dumb stuff for the day.
Laura: Stab stab stab.
Taliesin: It would've been so badass!
Matt: All right, so yeah. You continue to walk as the pixie floats up towards the top of the ziggurat. You get to the top and you notice that no, all the bodies have been removed. It's been cleaned up.
Laura: It's just an empty pyramid-y thing now.
Matt: Yeah, it's like this empty platform now with the walls, encased within a small colosseum. And there it is, the general spinning black marble. The pixie approaches and like--
Laura: (whines worriedly)
Taliesin: (whines worriedly)
Marisha: Yeah! Yeah. You got this.
Matt: Touches it, and you watch the pixie go-- and is gone.
Marisha: Hmm. So as we expected, yeah.
Travis: Well, hold on. Wait.
Laura: Wait.
Marisha: I don't think she's coming back, yeah.
Laura: Hey Allura, how many things did you throw in the orb?
Matt: You see her in the back leaning against the wall like she's seen this a hundred times. "Oh, many things. Chairs, outfits, pieces of stone, metals. We've put all kinds of things."
Sam: Any animals?
Liam: Anything alive?
Matt: "No, nothing living!"
Travis: What was the biggest thing you put in there?
Matt: "Your desk chair. Cassandra said it would be all right."
Taliesin: (sighs) Yes.
Laura: Have you put a box around it? Just encapsulated it completely?
Matt: "We tried, and upon moving it, once it contacted it did not move with the box. It just crushed and absorbed the box itself."
Taliesin: So. I have an interesting request which may end up being too complicated. I'm not sure.
Travis: Probably.
Taliesin: Can we build a teleportation sigil directly above it? Outside of its range?
Matt: "Given the better part of a year, yes."
Liam: So you're saying there's a chance?
Taliesin: Can we build one in the hallway leading to this room?
Matt: "A temporary one, as in like a--"
Marisha: Like a spell.
Matt: "Like a brief spell, yes. I can do that now. It's the permanent installation of one that takes an exorbitant period of time."
Taliesin: As long as we have some way of knowing what point at which we re-enter this room. Then we at least have a way of having it chase us into its range.
Marisha: Oh man.
Taliesin: Or better still, if we run one way and it runs the other.
Marisha: Have you been in contact? Have you attempted to scry, or do a Locate Object spell on anything that you've thrown in? Probably?
Matt: "Yes, but unfortunately there's been no way of connecting anything that goes through. It just vanishes."
Sam: I think that's a fucking terrible idea.
Travis: (chanting) Fire Plane.
Sam: What are you talking about? We can't lure a dragon into a teleportation circle big enough to get a dragon through, and then somehow assume that the dragon's going to keep running into the room with no magic? And then what are we also going to assume? That it's going to jump into the crazy Vecna circle and become a ninth level of hell after that? We have no idea! That's a terrible idea! I'm vetoing it.
Travis: I third that.
Taliesin: The cereal shiller has a point.
Liam: That idea's not grrreat! (laughter)
Laura: You've been waiting! Waiting to find a time to say it, haven't you?
Liam: Nope! Just drunkenly popped in my head.
Taliesin: Yes, Grog. You have a point?
Travis: Fire Plane.
Taliesin: If we are going to do the Fire Plane, if that is going to happen, then we cannot go until preparations start getting made for the place at which we're going to have this confrontation. We need to pick a point, preferably far from here. Is there a ruined city?
Sam: What, for us to lure Raishan-slash-Thordak to?
Laura: What about Fort Daxio?
Sam: Fort Daxio's near Emon. And so is Kymal.
Matt: "Well, it's north of Emon. Kymal's east of it. And the Ironsea Ridge. But Kymal's filled with civilians."
Laura: Fort Daxio has an army gathering there already, right?
Matt: "Well, Fort Daxio has a piece of an army. Most of it went to Syngorn and we haven't heard since."
Taliesin: Fort Daxio at least does have soldiers already.
Laura: Well, Syngorn is gathering their forces as well.
Matt: "Have you reached out to Syngorn, let them know this was going to happen? You mentioned that they were coming to power?"
Laura: We have.
Matt: "Well, we need to reach out to the resources we have and call them in."
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: Everyone, is Fort Daxio where this confrontation is going to happen?
Laura: We haven't been to Fort Daxio.
Sam: We should probably go check it out. But everyone wants to go to the Fire Plane, get some armor.
Taliesin: We go to Fort Daxio to start everything up. While they prepare, we can maybe make a trip to the Fire Plane once things are prepared. They will not need us to organize the armies and gather forces.
Marisha: It's really frustrating. I feel like we have all the pieces here. I just can't figure it out.
Taliesin: We have all the pieces buried underneath every civilian.
Marisha: I'm really obsessed on this ziggurat thing. Have you thrown any whitestone into the ziggurat?
Taliesin: No, don't do that.
Laura: I'm sure they already have.
Matt: "We have."
Sam: It's going to be fine, Keyleth. After we kill Thordak and Raishan becomes super-powerful, Raishan will come here and get the Vecna orb and unleash all sorts of hells on the world, and then we'll know what it was!
Liam: I mean, that's basically what's going to happen.
Taliesin: That's a very good plan.
Sam: Yeah, I mean, we can't really do anything about it.
Marisha: Which is why it's frustrating, because I feel like we can beat her to the fucking punch.
Liam: Yeah, I think Thordak's a fucking meathead and we should take care of Raishan ahead of time.
Marisha: You already know how I feel.
Taliesin: I think you're mad to think we can do that. I think that you're mad to think we're actually going to see her again before the final confrontation.
Travis: Yeah, we're not going to see her.
Taliesin: I think she's going to stay far, far away.
Laura: No. She knows.
Taliesin: I took that shot specifically to see where she was sitting and see where we were sitting with her.
Laura: You took that shot specifically to stab her three times in the back, Percy.
Taliesin: It also worked that we found out she wasn't there.
Liam: Yes, revisionist history.
Laura: I thought you were practicing honesty.
Travis: That's like saying I farted because my stomach hurt, and then I found out it stunk as well.
Taliesin: I was aware it could go horribly wrong, which is why I was prepared to say something.
Liam: Likely, there's a master plan; we understand.
Taliesin: I'm not saying it was the best plan.
Travis: Cool. Fort Daxio then? Check it out?
Taliesin: Does anybody else have anything to say to this?
Marisha: We basically don't have a plan. We're going somewhere until we come up with a plan in the meantime.
Taliesin: No, we're preparing all of our forces at Fort Daxio.
Matt: Cassandra says, "If Fort Daxio is to be the place where this is to go down, then that will be the place we'll send our allies."
Marisha: Jesus. Let's put all of our eggs in one basket.
Sam: Yeah. But what else are we saving them for? This is it.
Taliesin: This is the omelette. Where do we want our allies? Far away from the red dragon?
Marisha: You don't feel like we are stepping into every trap that Raishan has laid?
Sam: What else can we do?
Marisha: Kill Raishan first!
Sam: You can't heal the disease. We can't control this orb. There's nothing else we can do.
Marisha: It doesn't matter! We just need her to believe that I can cure her disease.
Laura: Let's be honest. Raishan wants Thordak dead. That's her endgame as well.
Liam: That's the only thing we can count on.
Taliesin: Because right now Raishan could have us all dead.
Travis: Are you saying you want Raishan to go with you one-on-one so you can do the Melora thing, and then maybe you take her out? And you want a shot at it before we try anything else? Because I'll grant you that.
Marisha: I could try. That's what I was trying to bait her into.
Laura: She's not going to show up.
Matt: Allura brings her hand up, "I've done plenty of research on these. I mean no offense to you, Keyleth, but you convincing an entity that exists on deception through deception to believe you in that regard? And based on that conversation, she already seems to see through that ruse. I would not recommend it."
Liam: Allura, any chance you know the Gate spell?
Matt: "No, that is far beyond my capabilities."
Travis: Yeah. Rare spell, that.
Taliesin: I'm not mad in thinking that trusting this creature is the only option available at this point. I say "trust". Walking in this direction is the only direction available at the moment. Any attempt to counter her at this point leads to our destruction. She has us.
Travis: Yeah, no, we got that. So does anybody want to do anything else before we go to Daxio?
Sam: The only thing else that we can do before we go to Daxio is to send word to our allies. I think we should grab Kash, send him out a quick list of who we need to contact. Ravenites. Feywild wolves.
Laura: Syngorn.
Liam: Syngorn.
Liam: Zahra, Kash.
Laura: Your people, Keyleth.
Liam: Kima. Allura.
Travis: Wolves are on another plane. Herd is wandering.
Laura: J'mon.
Sam: That's by flute. Wait. What about our brotherhood of-- what do we belong to? Not the Clasp--
Liam: Slayer's Take.
Sam: The Slayer's Take! We can get them too, right? We have money, we can hire them! We have a hundred thousand gold!
Taliesin: You want to hire them... Oh.
Laura: We could take out a contract against the red dragon.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: We can hire them to kill a red dragon.
Liam: Yeah. What are we going to do with that money when we're dead? Nothing.
Marisha: We are sending everyone we know into one centralized location. Do we really feel like that's a good idea?
Sam: Yes, this is what we've built towards.
Marisha: Is it?
Taliesin: We're building a trap. Where would you put them?
Marisha: We didn't talk about throwing everyone we loved into the frying pan. That was not the trap.
Sam: What did you think we were making allegiances for? Just to hang out with them? We need them to fight and die for us!
Marisha: I'm down for the cause of the war. Just not when it's a stupid fucking plan!
Sam: We're going to be there too!
Marisha: We don't have a plan! We're just asking everyone to meet in one location.
Liam: Well, we're talking about building an army.
Marisha: And then doing what with them?
Liam: To kill the general.
Marisha: And then doing what? They're just going to be sitting there! They're going to be sitting ducks!
Taliesin: They're not going to be sitting there. We're going to make tactical decisions about where to place everyone in and around the fort.
Marisha: I've accepted that people are going to die. I've accepted that. I do not condone sending people to their slaughter when we don't have a goddamn plan.
Taliesin: Well, what's your counter proposal? Because I feel like we're making a plan here.
Marisha: I don't think that it's smart to put every potential ally we know in one spot. Can we not divide it up? Can we not find places nearby?
Taliesin: They won't all just be in the fort. Everyone is going to be placed.
Sam: Once we get there and survey the area, we can come up with a comfortable plan. You can make some caverns for them to hide in.
Taliesin: We're going to also create ways of making sure the dragon can't take flight. We're going to make sure that everyone has a purpose and a place. It will not be just a giant swath of people ready to die.
Sam: We're just getting them in the right county.
Taliesin: We just need everybody in the city.
Marisha: But we also know that Raishan knows everything that we're going to do.
Laura: She doesn't know Fort Daxio. She doesn't know any of that.
Taliesin: She doesn't know Fort Daxio. Honestly, she's going to have to know. She's going to have to send them. There's nothing we can do about it.
Laura: She doesn't know about J'mon Sa Ord.
Marisha: I don't trust that she doesn't know anything. I'm going to assume that she knows everything.
Taliesin: That's a good assumption.
Travis: Yeah, that's fair.
Taliesin: Even so, there's nothing that she's not going to know, because she is what is luring him out. If we fought him here, she already knows where we are. Right now she knows where we are. She knows everybody that's here.
Sam: I go behind Keyleth and stab three times. (laughter)
Taliesin: Is this happening? Are we doing this? I'm so excited. Yeah!
Sam: No! I would so lose.
Marisha: Bring it! She's on edge, all right?
Taliesin: We have to play this the way we have to play it. It's dangerous, but we have to assume that she will most likely not betray us until the end.
Sam: Right now, somewhere, there's a man on an airship going, "Do you see it yet?"
Laura: They're keeping an eye out at this point, all right?
Taliesin: They're being good. We have to assume that she has not betrayed where we are yet, which would have been so simple. It would have been so simple just to raze this city to the ground.
Marisha: Look at what we did with Ripley. We walked into every trap she set for us blindly. We got cocky. We got bold. We fell for all of that.
Laura: Keyleth, we have to fight eventually. We're not trying to be cocky about it; we're trying to set up an army!
Sam: Might I point out, Keyleth, that Raishan wanted us to go to Emon and face Thordak, and we are already not following that plan.
Laura: This is true.
Taliesin: That is the other option. Go there.
Liam: We can count on her to be duplicitous. We gather forces; we take out Thordak. We'll figure out how we're going to do it. We're not saying throw every spaghetti at the wall. We figure that out. Then we talk about the real enemy.
Taliesin: It's a fort. We prepare the fort. It is what a fort is for.
Laura: If the opportunity arrives to take out Raishan, then we do it. Beforehand. If not, immediately after Thordak is dead.
Marisha: We could all be dead.
Taliesin: Why are we not dead right now? Explain to me why we are not dead right now.
Marisha: I honestly don't know.
Taliesin: Because this fight is going to happen. That is why we are not dead right now. It's the only possible explanation that I can conceive of. This fight is inevitable. Once this fight has happened? Oh, we're dead. After this fight, I have no doubt that we are in grave danger.
Laura: After this fight, there won't be enough people to bring us back anymore. (laughter)
Taliesin: But this fight, this first fight, is going to happen. And we need our forces, and we need them prepared, and we need them not marching into a city. We need them in a city holding siege. Preparing to tackle, to grapple, and to subdue as best we can. To be difficult to find, to be surrounding. We need all of these things, and we cannot do any of these things unless we bring him to a place where all of our power is.
Marisha: Let's go check out Fort Daxio.
Travis: Hey! (laughter)
Taliesin: Hey! (laughter)
Taliesin: Isn't it interesting that we all feel the need to convince her, no matter what? I'm just pointing that out.
Liam: Well, I don't know how we're going to get the king out of the castle, but yeah.
Laura: We need to figure out if Fort Daxio is the place to send everyone, all right? We got to fucking check it out.
Travis: Let's put one foot in front of the other first, shall we?
Liam: Let's go buy some black powder. This is the time.
Sam: How do we get there? We don't know of any trees there.
Matt: (as Victor) "No!"
Marisha: I can scry.
Taliesin: Ironically, any town where you go to buy black powder, it's always him. It's really interesting. I don't know why.
Liam: And he's in 16-bit every time! (laughter)
Sam: Do we know anyone in Daxio? Can you scry there to find a tree?
Marisha: I can scry there regardless and find a tree, yes.
Taliesin: Does the rest of the council approve of this ridiculous plan?
Travis: Yes, I approve.
Marisha: This non-plan.
Matt: Allura says, "Yes. I mean, I don't know anyone in Daxio at the moment. Riskel was the only one. Or Riskel was the one I knew with a connection there, and his father, Mikael, was in Syngorn."
Taliesin: Do you think that they will be agreeable to this plan?
Matt: "Who? Those who are there, most likely. Here, I'll give you a written..." and she pulls out a small little side scroll pouch. Scribbling a note and says, "This is a decree from the council. They'll have to listen to you." She finishes writing it, rolls it up, "So they'll be at your disposal. It's not the army; it's the reserves."
Taliesin: Any powers that you can think of, let them know where we are heading. Do not let them know the plan. But let them know that if there are forces to gather, they are gathering in that direction.
Sam: And don't share our carefully crafted plan with anyone. The details are so precise and exact! You must keep them secret.
Taliesin: The more precise details you have in a war plan, the more things that will inevitably go wrong in the first ten seconds.
Sam: Hey, how about we go to Daxio, and then you guys can catch up? The airship arrives in a couple of days.
Matt: "We'll do that. And then we're meeting you at Daxio, correct?"
Travis: Yeah. (chants) Dax-i-o. Dax-i-o.
Taliesin: (chants) Dax-i-o. Daxio!
Matt: "Very well. Daxio it is. We'll see you soon."
Sam: On the morrow.
Taliesin: No, we plan.
Sam: Be pleased.
Liam: Beep beep.
Laura: Beep beep.
Matt: Beep beep. Bidet.
Marisha: Bidet. (laughter)
Matt: And with that, we'll finish the night's session, picking up here for next week.
Marisha: We're finishing it now?
Matt: Well, yeah. It's 10 30.
Travis: What was under that blanket?
Matt: I don't know. You'll find out, I guess.
Liam: Dumbfuck ending.
Marisha: Sorry, guys.
Taliesin: I tried to stab a dragon. I swear, I tried.
Travis: No, we know you did.
Taliesin: I tried to end the game. I thought the game could totally have been ended right there.
Liam: You've got that gunslinger sneak attack times ten damage against a green dragon.
Taliesin: Man, I did the math on what that could have done.
Matt: It could have been nasty, had it been a less tricksy dragon, maybe.
Taliesin: Had it been a less tricksy dragon, that would have been...
Liam: Matt, you've got a little something right--
Matt: (as Victor) There? Here?
Laura: Right there.
Liam: You got it. (laughter)
Laura: You got it. (laughter)
Matt: (as Victor) I get to enjoy this for a little bit, at least.
Travis: We should have him walk down the street and take bets on how long it takes him to get arrested. (laughter)
Liam: Just put him on Melrose.
Marisha: Those YouTube videos of social experiments? Just send out Matt.
Matt: (as Victor) Two cheeseburgers. Couple of fry.
Taliesin: Filet of fish!
Matt: (as Victor) Filet of fish! (normal voice) Oh, man. All right. We'll be back next week. For whatever the hell your final plan is going to be for this.
Taliesin: This is a great plan. I am behind this plan 100%.
Matt: I am so excited.
Travis: Thank you, Loot Crate.
Matt: Thank you, Loot Crate.
Sam: Come on, Loot Crate.
Matt: I'm excited for the countdown to Thordak that we're now embarking on.
Taliesin: Maybe there will be time to run to the Fire Plane really quick.
Marisha: I was going to say, sorry for being a pain in the ass. It takes a lot for me to sacrifice all my people when a fourth of us have already been sacrificed.
Taliesin: We'll go to the Fire Plane and get them and we'll pick up an object and we'll fight a dragon. It will be great.
Travis: It's cool. I have an internal timer, and if you don't meet it, I'm going to kill all your people. (laughter)
Taliesin: The glasses make that weirdly threatening.
Liam: (singing) It's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band.
Marisha: New at Sundance!
Matt: Cool, guys. Thank you so much. Everyone looks awesome. Happy Halloween, everyone!
All: Happy Halloween!
Sam: Hashtag Critical Costumes!
Taliesin: Get candy from strangers.
Marisha: Yeah, go knock on strangers' doors and get candy from them.
Taliesin: Do it! It's good for America. Eat candy from strangers.
Marisha: Totally inflated.
Matt: Rest well. We'll see you next week. (as Victor) Is it Thursday yet? [music]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: ♪
Matt: Welcome back, guys. I hope you enjoyed your-- your holiday. Hope you enjoyed your new year and are ready to tackle all the chaos this year has coming. Both fists forward. So, missed you guys. Last we left off was a little crazy, but before we get to that circumstance, let's go ahead and start with our announcements. Yay! (cheers) First and foremost, our first episode of the year is sponsored by us happy to be back. We have no sponsor tonight. (cheers)
Marisha: Happiness!
Matt: So sponsored instead by viewers like you. So... Thank you. But, yeah, so other announcements we have. Me and Marisha will be running from this episode tonight to pack and leave at a super early, pre-dawn flight. Pretty much, or at dawn flight, to MAGFest. We'll be there getting in later tomorrow, and be there this weekend. So, those of you who are going to MAGFest, we'll see you there. We have--
Laura: Is that what it is, just a lot of magazines?
Matt: Just a lot of magazines.
Taliesin: People, US Weekly.
Marisha: Oprah.
Matt: We pretty much got in there only because of the article in Game Informer. That's the only reason we were invited. No, MAGFest is great. We have a Critical Role panel tomorrow evening that me and Marisha will be doing, and other fun stuff Saturday and Sunday. So, look for us in the schedule and we'll look forward to seeing you guys at the actual event. Travis, you wanted to mention something real quick?
Travis: Yes! I wanted to give a quick shout out to Kathy Creshe, Creshaw, I don't know how to say it.
Taliesin: That was a good shout out.
Travis: From Pennsylvania.
Sam: Big fan of the show?
Travis: We love you, from us, to you.
Laura: We read your email.
Travis: It was wonderful.
Travis: Sam!
Sam: Uh, yeah, tonight's sponsor is Critical Role, as you said, we have lots of stuff. Lots of merchandise available in the store. The logo shirt, mugs, patches, nail wraps, hats, key chains, and necklaces are available and if you didn't see it over the Christmas break, we have the Gilmore shirts and the "How do you want to do this?" shirts and you guys know this, we have a big Spanish speaking fan base, and I wanted to give them some love, so I thought I'd do our ad tonight in Spanish. Two notes, two notes, I don't speak Spanish, and second note is my neighbor's son translated this for me. So, he's in Spanish Two. Should be pretty basic.
Travis: Not, "He's Spanish too."
Sam: No, he's-- he's a sophomore in high school. Hola, me llamo Sam Riegel. Aquí está mi perro. Se llama Travis Willingham. Una broma. ¿Te gustan las camisas t-shirt? Espero que sí porque tenemos dos camisas t-shirt para vender en nuestra tienda. Una es color morado. Es para Gilmore's Glorious Goods. (laughter) La otra no es morado, es gris. Tiene el slogan de Matthew Mercer, which is... ¿Como quieres hacer esto? (laughter) No cuestan muchos pesos. Tu vas a ir internet y comprar ahora. ¡Gracias por favor! (applause, cheers)
Travis: Muy bien!
Marisha: Yay for Spanish Two!
Taliesin: High school Spanish is the official language of Los Angeles, well done.
Travis: A future translator will then, like, show up?
Sam: I don't know.
Taliesin: It'll be insulted. Actually, yeah, it'll actually Google translate and will be like, I refuse to even touch this.
Sam: It's for our Spanish language viewers. -There are many.
Travis: That was great.
Matt: This is true. Thank you so much. Anyone else? Oh, I want to announce real fast too. We received quite a bit of Critmas gifts after we had filmed the Critmas episode last month. So, as we're slowly retrieving them from the mailbox, me, Marisha, Taliesin, and possibly anybody that's available at the time, Liam, Laura will be doing a Periscope opening of the rest of those gifts in the next couple of weeks or so. Be announcing it ahead of time, so pay attention to that, but it is coming. So, don't worry. We'll be getting to your presents and thanking you for all your awesome unnecessary generosity. You're so wonderful and we'll let you know once it's happening. Anybody else have any other announcements they want to make?
Travis: Hands up!
Sam: Uh?
Travis: Hands up!
Matt: Alright, great. That being the case.
Marisha: I don't know--
Liam: I don't know what this--
Matt: Let's go ahead and dive in. To the first 2017 episode of Critical Role.
Taliesin: ♪ Do you believe in life after-- ♪♪ (growling, screaming) ♪ (electricity crackling) ♪
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So, getting us up to speed with the current circumstance that we left off at the end of last episode. Vox Machina, the main adventurers, spending the better part of this past year under the shadow of the Chroma Conclave, a group of ancient chromatic dragons that have banded together, seemingly under the banner of Thordak, The Cinder King, a great red dragon that had been sealed in the fire elemental plane for a number of years. Newly released and carrying with him what was called a soul anchor. A magical artifact made from the heart of a fire primordial that had begun to cause him to mutate and swell and become something beyond what he was. Also driving him apparently insane. As he dominated the countryside of Tal'Dorei, along with the rest of the Conclave, you gather artifacts of great power called the Vestiges of Divergence under the guidance of two sphinx allies. You travel between various planes and gathering these artifacts gathered allies and prepared for this climactic confrontation in your home city of Emon, now partially brought to ruin and flame. You assembled an army. You snuck beneath the city. You arrived within the center of the Cloudtop district nearly under the nose of Thordak's defending hordes, and through a climactic seeming sacrifice by your friends Kashaw and Zahra, were allowed to pass directly into the Cloudtop heading off Thordak before he could emerge from his subterranean lair and lay waste to the armies as they pushed inward towards his lair. ♪
Travis: When you say it like that.
Matt: There you all did battle with the great colossal Thordak, The Cinder King. A well prepared fight rolled out and while there was much danger, you all persevered and managed to, using the vestiges, destroy the soul anchor once it was revealed within the body of the great red dragon. His form rescinding and withering back to its regular, seemingly withering size. You-- it attempted to flee back into its lair, but the rather rapid and temporarily winged rogue, Vax'ildan gave chase and dealt a finishing blow to the great red beast midway through its cavern towards its lair. There you were joined briefly by your sister and an ally you had made through this circumstance, Raishan, one green dragon. The member of the Conclave that seemingly had made a tenuous alliance with you as her goal also was to destroy Thordak. Aiding you in the battle, Raishan followed suit and upon the corpse of Thordak laying cut, bleeding and dead in the center of this cavern, she wished to take her end of the deal you had made. To be left alone with the corpse for a moment to acquire some secret knowledge that apparently she was seeking from the dead dragon. Upon releasing the energy from the scroll which she had utilized the incantation from, you decided that vengeance being your oath as a paladin and the history that you have with Keyleth and Keyleth's people that died under the guise of Raishan's initial plotting with Thordak to not let this creature stand and attacked it. Both you and your sister, just as Keyleth began to arrive. The rest of the party slowly staggering behind. Raishan sneered and went further back into the cavern. You all gave chase into this dark, volcanic tunnel system which then opened up into a large, red flaming cavern filled with lava pools and rivers, and apparently a handful of red eggs, it looked like scattered throughout this room. Thick dark red crimson scales with crystalline formations pouring out of the sides. Very similar to Thordak's primordial dragon form. Upon finding not Raishan, but just this empty space, you looked up to see a series of arcane summoned meteors suddenly given form, rocketing from the ceiling of the cavern and slamming into the floor dealing some of you a pretty dangerous blow and sending you scattering across the floor a bit. Vex being thrown across the way. You all managed to survive as at the end of the last battle, I'd forgotten that you had made your save and you actually, your bludgeon damage was halved, so Vex is conscious, though still hurting.
Sam: ♪ Whoo ♪
Liam: ♪ Whoo ♪♪
Matt: As the dust settles and you all take stock of what had just transpired, you see the snout of the green dragon pull up into what appears to be a series of dark volcanic exhaust tunnels that seem to be like a hive network of-- of honeycomb type tunnels that just spiral off all through the ceiling, and that's where we left off in the last sequence here.
Sam: Geez, Louise.
Matt: Which, previously, behind if I'm--if I'm correct, and I believe I am, and if not, internet, it's fine, we'll--we'll do the narrative. We have the three of you in the room. We have Percy, Scanlan, Pike and Gilmore rushing up behind as fast as they can. Grog and Kima had stayed behind to finish up one of the more recent battles and Jarret is just not going in. He is not in a place to follow suit. "You got this, you got this. Do not worry, it's okay."
Liam: Before we ran into the bigger chamber, Gilmore and Jarret had caught up with us if I remember correctly.
Matt: No, they did not.
Laura: Oh, they hadn't gotten to us.
Liam: I remember that they did.
Matt: No, they would have gotten into the chamber with you. Only the three of you made it into the chamber.
Liam: That's what I mean.
Matt: They got into the tunnel, but they hadn't got up to your guys. The speed in which you guys all got there was basically just Raishan and the three of you, then the attack happened. Raishan rushed in, you rush after her. Everyone else has kinda been left in the dust. They're not too far behind you, but things be as they may. We begin tonight's episode at this next round of combat. Continuing where we last did.
Laura: Oh, God, oh God!
Marisha: Jesus Christ.
Travis: Oh God, oh God, oh God.
Matt: So--
Sam: Why from there? You're fine.
Taliesin: No, stop, don't.
Marisha: Yeah, police.
Matt: So, at the top of this combat round, technically, Percy, you have the initiative on this. You are continuing to push through this-- this hallway. You haven't quite even, at a double dash, you can hear explosions in the distance and then you guys watch as suddenly smoke, silt and ash come flying through the tunnel from within immediately followed by the sound of these large, heavy, banging explosions. Some sort of heavy impact, a series of impacts seem to have detonated deep within the tunnel and immediately set everyone in the vicinity on edge knowing that something is still transpiring in a very dangerous way deeper within this tunnel.
Taliesin: I am throwing on my mask and I am running into the room. I'm actually gonna be spider crawling. I'm gonna be on the-- on the walls so that I'm-- yeah. I don't want to be in the line of anything that happens.
Marisha: That's awesome.
Liam: Spider Percy's my favorite Percy.
Matt: It's just the feet, Percy.
Marisha: ♪ Spider Percy, Spider Percy ♪♪
Matt: You can if you want, if you really want to.
Sam: He's like walking like this?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Running.
Sam: Cool!
Taliesin: This ain't Dr. Strange, this is--
Liam: He's doing this and nothing's happening.
Taliesin: Out of fluid, you know.
Liam: If anyone can make it, it's you.
Taliesin: I know, I got to make-- I got to make Spider-- Spider Percy.
Matt: So, anyway, that ends your turn. You--you run past on the side of the wall, as the ash begins to settle around you as you run past, kind of preparing your weapons for a coming confrontation, you glance out to your right and see there the smoldering wreckage of red scales and dragon blood that was once Thordak, the cinder king. You see that and down it's about-- You keep running. You can see a gentle glimmer in the distance of a battlefield, but you're not quite there yet.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Okay, the top of the round. The three of you finding yourselves in this circumstance. We go to the lair actions. So, these lair actions are--
Laura: Oh God.
Matt: Of Thordak's lair, as this is not Raishan's lair, but even though Thordak is dead, the lair itself has its own natural, naturally occurring dangers.
Travis: Damn it!
Matt: So.
Sam: What? That don't make no sense, man. Thordak's dead. His lair dies with him.
Matt: Over time! Maybe, you don't know.
Travis: His home security system still pays for it.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Exactly, yeah. It's-- it's on a recurring subscription plan. So, there will be--
Taliesin: How do I pee?
Matt: The lava that you had just landed across. So, Vex'ahlia, as you are knocked from the explosions of the meteors from landing on your back, and just barely getting back up to your feet, your vision comes back as you see the stream of lava that's just barely pouring past. Very slowly begins to...
Laura: I back up, I back up.
Matt: As it opens and sprays here at 20 foot radius.
Laura: I climb back up and I bump an egg.
Matt: I'm going to bring out my templates.
Taliesin: No.
Laura: This is gonna kill me, isn't it?
Matt: This will explode and all three of you-- I need you all three to make dexterity saving throws.
Marisha: Oh, boy.
Taliesin: Yay.
Marisha: This is great.
Laura: Cool. This is-- is this--
Taliesin: First roll of 2017.
Laura: Oh, wait, I'm hasted.
Marisha: Twenty total.
Sam: Twenty total's good.
Marisha: Yeah!
Laura: Seven.
Liam: Twenty-seven.
Matt: Okay, that's fine. So, as it is a hotter, more dangerous vicinity here, the damage is higher, but you all managed to make your saves, so you're only taking half damage as you all avoid from the spray of magma that just bursts out and splashes in your area.
Liam: Evasion keeps me at zero, yeah?
Matt: Yes, because you have your rogue evasionness, and it's three ones, alright.
Laura: Yay.
Taliesin: Yay.
Matt: So, that'll be 18 points of fire damage reduced to nine. (indistinguishable dialogue)
Marisha: I mean, I'm not, you know.
Laura: Still terrified.
Marisha: Taking it for granted. (talking over each other) Yeah, yeah, something like that. Or five, it's debatable. Depends on the health of the people.
Matt: Next up in the initiative order is Raishan.
Laura: Oh, good.
Matt: So, as the splash happens, you glance up and you can see what looks to be a series of maybe a dozen or so of these volcanic lava tubes that kind of are these-- these caverns roughly the size of a very low live, kind of pushed in cat-like Raishan. You see the head and the tail kind of hanging out the side as Raishan begins to mutter some sort of an incantation under her breath. You hear the echo... (whispering incantation) Between the room as it kind of quivers for a second. And her form just vanishes.
Travis: Damn it.
Liam: But we saw where she was before she went into--
Matt: You did.
Sam: Fight over, that's it. That's great.
Laura: Oh my God, she-- she ran away.
Sam: Alright, let's mop up here and go home.
Travis: Punk ass, Raishan.
Marisha: The air ate her.
Matt: I guarantee you that's probably not the case. No.
Travis: You're saying there's a chance.
Matt: Yes. Alrighty.
Marisha: Dude.
Taliesin: Just shunned her into invisibility.
Matt: Great. That brings us next to Keyleth's turn.
Laura: Keyleth, just kill her. Find her and kill her so we can get--
Marisha: Whereabouts was she last?
Matt: Last you saw was up in this cavernous area roughly in this portion of the ceiling.
Marisha: But we can assume she probably went invisible and then moved.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: I could do Faerie Fire on her, but I mean, I don't know where she is and it's a 20 foot cube. It'd probably be a waste. So, instead, I'm going to cast Call Lightning at fourth level, and go fire elemental.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: How's that work?
Laura: It's an ongoing-- Lightning is an ongoing--
Marisha: Yeah, it's a concentration. Yeah, I can make it--
Sam: So it just exists there? -Ready to strike?
Taliesin: Like a ghostbuster.
Sam: Cool.
Matt: So, as you watch Keyleth's eyes flare with this bright electric kind of blue yellow light, as the ash and bit of dust that has been kind of plummeting from the ceiling from the impact of the meteor swarms and the movement of some now not seeable dragon amongst the ceiling caverns. It gathers into this swirling storm that begins to build and form across the top domed portion of this cavern. As it does, you watch bolts of electricity... Arc through the storm as Keyleth's form then whooshes into a burst swirl of flaming energy. Her physical body now becoming a swirling fire elemental. You wish to move or you're gonna stay where you are?
Marisha: I'm going to take a few steps back and-- question. Can I look up and see if, like, the clouds are kind of shaping around like a, you know, roughly dragon shaped body? That make sense?
Taliesin: She's looking for disturbances of the force.
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: You gave me that "this is bullshit" look.
Taliesin: Roll a 29.
Marisha: Oh, that's not bad. With perception, perception. Sorry, I'm so nervous, 26.
Matt: Twenty-six. Glancing about between the dust that's falling, the movement of the storm that you've gathered at the roof of the ceiling, you don't see anything that identifies the location of a dragon now.
Marisha: Yeah, so it's fine. So, I'll take a few steps back.
Matt: So you're about right there?
Marisha: Yeah, oh, oh.
Taliesin: Wow, it's weirdly mirrored. Okay, that took me a second.
Marisha: It's totally mirrored.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Laura: Oh!
Taliesin: Yeah, I know, cool.
Liam: Your screen is flipped.
Laura: That's crazy.
Marisha: It's fine. It's not a problem.
Taliesin: We have the same view you do.
Laura: It's actually, no, I think it's better, because we're looking at it from his perspective.
Taliesin: So, we can say like, "move us down," and they'll be towards him now. Yeah.
Marisha: I'm sorry, so move me--
Matt: Further in?
Marisha: Yeah, down-- down.
Sam: Towards the lava or away from the lava?
Marisha: Right there, down one more. -Other way.
Taliesin: South.
Laura: Oh my God.
Marisha: South. Yeah, that's good, that's-- that's good.
Taliesin: There.
Matt: Good, alright.
Laura: Where's our pointer?
Matt: Where's your laser pointers guys?
Taliesin: Where are our pointers? We need new pointers.
Laura: It's been three weeks, Matt.
Matt: It has been, I know.
Sam: We've forgotten how to play.
Matt: That's okay. Alright, so--
Marisha: It's like inverted controls.
Taliesin: I'm taking Diva.
Matt: Now, is that your turn?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Alright, finishing Keyleth's turn. That brings us to Gilmore who's rushing up past--
Laura: Come on, Gilmore.
Matt: Keeping up his pace as much as he can. "Oh, boy. I know you guys take me to the nicest places." And he's just jogging as best he can. Rushing into the ash cloud as another one pushes through. Some of the wind tending to push and causing swirling little dust devils of ash and cinder. That's gonna end his turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: So you glance up.
Laura: I glance up.
Matt: You see all this happening, what are you gonna do?
Laura: I'm gonna get on my broom.
Taliesin: Get on up.
Laura: And I'm gonna take a health potion.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: So...
Matt: Regular health potion?
Laura: I have a Greater.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I have one Greater. So, that's a what? 4d8?
Matt: A Greater is 4d4 plus four. Remember you guys are pretty low on any powerful potions at this point. You used most of them, so, yeah.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, I had a Greater left. It's jack shit. Ten, ten whole points.
Matt: There you go, ten points of healing. On your broom.
Laura: I'm gonna go back towards the entrance. Post up to the entrance, like off the ground as far as I can get.
Matt: That's about as far as you can get. You want to stay hovering or just like there on the ground?
Laura: Hovering! Stay off the ground and can I--
Matt: Are you going up ten feet or 20 feet or are you staying just above the ground so you're not standing on it?
Laura: I'm gonna go up ten feet.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And if I can be a little bit further away from Keyleth, that'd be clutch.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I mean, I don't know if it'd be clutch, but it would be helpful. Can I look up, and see if I can see like, dust coming down from any of the holes, to see if Raishan is moving around in the holes on the ceiling--
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Liam: There's a storm cloud.
Laura: I know, I know. Is this pertaining to dragons so I would get advantage?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: That's the same thing.
Liam: Two 13's.
Laura: So, perception, so that's 26.
Matt: Okay, so glancing about, unfortunately, the gathering of the Call Lightning cloud combined with the other dark ash-filled interior, you don't see anything that signifies the location of a dragon. You do glance over and you notice that where you landed previously, one of the eggs was pretty much just destroyed by this-- 'cause it was the area of the meteor swarm where you guys were hit. So, all gathered here, so this egg right here by where you were, is currently just crushed inward and filled with rock.
Marisha: And--
Laura: Really? Is there anything oozing out of it?
Marisha: Yeah, what's--
Laura: I should have looked at it before.
Matt: It's hard to see, it's far away, but it looks like the egg has been destroyed.
Laura: Destroyed?
Sam: Destroyed?
Laura: She doesn't care about the eggs.
Sam: Or she didn't destroy it.
Liam: Not the Mama!
Laura: Okay, so I've got-- I'm so sorry.
Marisha: That's true.
Travis: So, it's covered with rocks.
Laura: I don't know where my notes are to see what my spells were from before. I didn't have it set up cause I'm a horrible person.
Marisha: But that was from the lair action.
Sam: Yeah, that wasn't her.
Laura: Okay, this is-- this is the last one. Oh, I didn't do like any spells before. So, I'm gonna cast-- I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on myself.
Matt: Okay. What level?
Marisha: Yeah, but does she care or even not care?
Taliesin: We'll find out.
Laura: I'm gonna cast it at third level.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: So, that's 1d8-- 2d8 plus my spell casting modifier.
Matt: So, a 3d8 technically.
Laura: 3d8?
Matt: Cause if you're casting at third level, it's 3d8 plus your spell modifier.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: That's good, that's good, that's good.
Marisha: This is turning into a Jerry Springer episode. Is she or is she not the mom?
Laura: No, my modifier, which is my wisdom. Ten plus-- Jesus Christ, I'm sorry! Ten plus--
Taliesin: Three weeks, man.
Laura: Thirteen points heal.
Marisha: It's like riding a bike, riding a bike.
Liam: Three weeks to stew, everybody.
Matt: Alright, there you go. At the end of your turn-- Actually she's gonna do--
Taliesin: It's like riding a bike with pen and paper.
Matt: Okay. You feel this strange, sudden warm tingling sensation separate from the healing spell just in your vicinity. Almost like a warm breeze just kind of passes through you. That's it.
Sam: Oh, boy.
Matt: End of your turn.
Sam: What does that mean?
Laura: I don't know.
Sam: You've been cursed forever.
Travis: It's a bloody fart.
Taliesin: Farting dragon. Invisible farting dragon.
Laura: What if that was a baby dragon?
Liam: I'm gonna take to the air. I'm going to-- do I still feel hasted yet?
Matt: You-- yes, you do.
Liam: I'm going to fly past my sister and slap the one Greater healing potion I have into her palm.
Laura: Oh, thank you.
Liam: Oh, Superior, excuse me.
Laura: What?!
Liam: And then I'm going to curve around over Keyleth and stab the egg there with the Dragon Slayer blade.
Sam: Oh, boy.
Matt: This one?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Stabbing eggs?
Taliesin: That should give you a Dragon Slayer bonus also.
Matt: Go ahead and roll for attack.
Travis: Isn't that poaching?
Liam: That is 29.
Matt: That hits.
Sam: Go home Travis, you're drunk.
Travis: I'm working on it.
Laura: The babies will help us though. What if the babies are cute? -Can we raise them?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: You want to try and Daenerys this shit?
Taliesin: We can raise them by setting them on fire.
Marisha: We each get one, you guys.
Liam: Twenty-six.
Matt: Twenty-six points of damage. Alright, you take the blade as you rush up and then hack through it. The blade only gets a few inches into the tough outer exterior of this egg and you have to push and carve through and you do carve a-- a sliver through the egg's shell and a little bit of deep, brownish-maroon liquid begins to spill out of it, but that's-- it's not a heavy amount of damage to the egg.
Liam: I'm gonna take Whisper and take that further.
Matt: Go ahead and roll for a secondary attack.
Liam: That is 28 to hit.
Matt: 28, that hits. I'll mark the eggs that are damaged and destroyed. This one is...
Liam: That's a total of 15.
Matt: Oh, that's not working too well. Good to know. Total of what?
Liam: Fifteen.
Matt: Fifteen, okay. With that much damage, the egg begins to crack even further. More of the liquid begins to spill. The blade pulls through and you can see, as you tear a chunk of the actual shell of this egg off and it falls, you have punctured some sort of thick amniotic sac. That's what the fluid that's spilling out of it, but you haven't seemingly touched any sort of flesh or creature within, but the egg is currently has a section that is exposed.
Liam: And I have--if I'm still hasted, I have a lot of movement left, so I'm going to fly and hover about 15 feet above the egg towards you, towards your DM tape on the side there.
Matt: Over here?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Fifteen feet in the air. ♪ I have 120 feet of movement total hasted.
Laura: So, we were lining up? We're seriously lining up?
Liam: No, I'm all the way over there.
Laura: No, you're in a line.
Liam: That's not where I want to be. I want to be--
Matt: I know, I'm-- I'm calculating how much movement you have.
Liam: I'm arguing with her, not you.
Matt: Ah, no worries.
Liam: Cause that's what we do cause we love each other.
Matt: You can get right there.
Liam: Okay. Fifteen feet in the air.
Matt: Fifteen feet in the air?
Liam: That's not the egg that I'm talking about though.
Laura: Look, I'm talking about--
Liam: I'm talking about the egg closer to Matt.
Laura: Yes, there it is.
Liam: There.
Laura: That one!
Liam: This is where I want to go.
Laura: That's where you are, dude.
Liam: That's over there?
Laura: Yeah, it's reverse.
Liam: It's the--it's the flip screen is-- I don't want to go there. I want to go across from everybody. It's the flip.
Sam: Guys, just don't look at the TV. Look at the screen.
Matt: Over this way?
Travis: Closer, Matt?
Liam: I'm gonna kill you all.
Matt: Bare with this, new tech. New year, we're making this work.
Liam: There, there. The egg that's there.
Taliesin: I have a brilliant solution for this for next time.
Matt: So, from there-- yeah. You wouldn't be able to make it there.
Liam: Literally, in game.
Sam: Invert controls.
Travis: It's like a jet fighter.
Marisha: Battleship.
Taliesin: We can Battleship it. Next time, next time, we'll just have a row of letters and a row of numbers. -Says move me up to L7.
Laura: I can't use inverted controls.
Sam: I only use inverted.
Laura: Really?
Taliesin: Isn't that a great idea?
Matt: Destroyed.
Taliesin: That was amazing.
Matt: This egg has one crack in the side there. Okay.
Laura: Did you just mark on your cool eggs?
Travis: He's using dry erase.
Matt: Wet erase and, you know. It's fun.
Taliesin: It's either that or lick them.
Sam: How many more times are we gonna play with dragon eggs in a year?
Travis: Did you have us on tiny plastic eggs?
Matt: Yeah, so I ordered way too many. I put a bunch in my cart to make sure that I-- I didn't know which one to get and then forgot about it, came back and was like, "Oh shit, I got to order that." Ended up buying like three bags full.
Taliesin: What am I gonna do with all these eggs?
Matt: We'll have egg plastic giveaways. That ends your turn, Vax? Alright. At the end of your turn, Vax, you feel the effect of the haste potion dissipate and your body, all of a sudden, goes from this hyperactive, very familiar mode to extremely lethargic and you find yourself having to fight to catch your breath. So, you can't take any actions next turn. -Can't do anything.
Laura: Oh, it's the potion.
Matt: It's the potion, it's not the boots.
Liam: The boots, right.
Matt: Kima is trying to keep up pace with you, Grog. You're still in your large form. How long's that last for?
Travis: Let me check. Enlarge: 10 minutes.
Matt: Yeah, alright, so you're like bounding through. Kima's falling behind. As you guys both enter, and continue past you hear the explosions in the distance and all of a sudden, the rolling of smoke and ash rushes past you. The smell doesn't bother you cause you've had the smell of burning beard hair most of this close to your nose. What was once your great bush beard is a little tighter to your face now.
Travis: What? You've taken a few dragon fire breaths to the face. The fact that you have any hair is by the grace of your ancestral history. That Dwarven belt you have.
Travis: I know, that's why it's so precious.
Matt: But are you just going full sprint to catch up with everybody?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Alright.
Travis: I'll just roll it. I still have Pike with me, right?
Matt: Pike is coming with you, yeah. 'Cause you picked her up. so you're just running with Pike. Kima's just like, "Damn it!" Left in the ash. You, while you were behind, you, with your full speed, being faster than everybody else in this group, you almost catch up entirely to Percy and Gilmore and pretty much on their initiative count going forward, or at least of the arrival count in the next round. That finishes your go. Let's see. ♪ You were after Vax, right?
Travis: Yes, no, no, I was right before Vax.
Matt: Right, so I got a little out of order, sorry, my apologies. Alright, so anyway, it wouldn't have made a difference. So Kima goes for a run. Pike. Is Pike doing anything on your back?
Laura: Yes. Pike's gonna heal you.
Travis: Who?
Laura: You.
Travis: Me?
Sam: Ran away.
Laura: Yeah, she's--
Liam: Oh, wait, she's with him.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: He's carrying her.
Liam: Nice.
Travis: I got a little backpack.
Marisha: I was just gonna say, is she Yoda-ing you?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Is it like a Yoda situation, that's awesome.
Travis: The force. That was terrible.
Matt: That was pretty awful, actually. (talking over each other)
Sam: Hi, I'm Yoda.
Travis: I think that's his brother, Carl.
Laura: She's gonna cast Cure Wounds at third level on him.
Taliesin: That Seagulls song is so great.
Laura: So, that's three d8's.
Marisha: One of the best things they've done in a while.
Taliesin: One of the best things they've done in a long while.
Laura: Ooh, that's pretty good. Sixteen plus her page, her modifier. What is-- oh, that's--
Travis: Wisdom?
Laura: That's my page.
Liam: Clerics are--
Matt: Wisdom, wisdom. Five, so add five to that.
Laura: Plus five, 18. -Twenty-one.
Matt: There you go.
Travis: Thanks, Pike.
Laura: "Oh, you're welcome, Grog."
Liam: You know.
Laura: Well, you know.
Matt: Scanlan.
Sam: I will run... my 25 feet, and then pop a potion. Just a normal potion of healing 'cause that's all I got.
Matt: So, that's a 1d-- 2d4 plus two.
Sam: Okay. Ooh. 2d4 plus two?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Five.
Matt: You heal five hit points.
Sam: Great, I'm up to 70.
Matt: Are you-- are you doing anything else on your turn? Are you dashing?
Sam: Can I use my action to dash?
Matt: Yes, your action to move again, essentially.
Sam: Okay. I will do such a thing cause I don't even know. I'm just following people and--
Matt: Yeah, you're a little bit behind and you're pretty much-- Grog has caught up to you, and you guys are just behind Gilmore and Percy at this point.
Sam: Okay, I'm in front of Grog still?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Damn. (laughing)
Matt: Well, he was running while you-- (breathing heavily)
Sam: Objects in the mirror are gigantic.
Matt: Okay, at the end of your turn--
Sam: I die. ♪
Matt: Vax. You, as you fly over with your wings in the air, looking down at the egg. You feel this sudden warm wind pass through you.
Laura: What is that?
Marisha: Fuck, is that her?
Matt: You don't quite-- it seems sourceless, but it just seems to fill you and leave.
Laura: Does it feel good when it happens or does it feel like--
Matt: It's just different. It's already a hot, like you're all sweating in here, so the fact that you feel something, like, warm briefly comparatively to the temperature around you is what catches your attention. It doesn't hurt or damage you, but it just seems strange.
Taliesin: I don't like any of this.
Marisha: I don't like any of it.
Sam: It's menopause. (laughing)
Laura: It's natural.
Liam: You ruined the surprise.
Travis: I cast Menopause on you.
Liam: I'll pretend like I suffer it myself.
Matt: Okay, good.
Travis: You bastard.
Matt: Percival, we're up at the top of the initiative.
Taliesin: I'm running my way in there.
Matt: Alright. So... Alrighty. Percival, at a full run. If you go full run, you'll manage to get just barely inside the cavern about there.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Right there.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Matt: So, that'll be your turn. There's still a bonus action if you have any use for it, so.
Taliesin: I don't really have-- Mostly I just want to use my bonus action to take in everything and look around and have a-- have a good, good serious look. In fact, I'll even take a perception roll if I can have one.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: Just a good sit and think.
Taliesin: Let's get-- okay, no never mind. That's pretty good. Wow, it has been a while. -Twenty-five.
Matt: Twenty-five. Glancing around, you see a fire elemental that briefly startles you as you kind of whip around in that direction, but you recognize--
Marisha: And like, it's got antlers, and I'm like... (grunts)
Taliesin: I love Hannibal too, it's great. Okay. Eggs, dust.
Matt: Yeah, you see eggs. One is destroyed and just leaking out and like a series of boulders and what looks like some sort of a large, concave impression on the top. There are eggs scattered throughout the area. There's a giant storm cloud gathering in the roof of the cavern, and there is the large pool of lava with the small pool over there. You see occasional glimmers of what look like coin in the distance.
Taliesin: Can you put me, like, on the wall just cause I don't think I'd be-- I was still spider crawling so even on top of the little wall thing, if you want.
Matt: Sure, I'll put you there. Sure, why not, Percy?
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: You're welcome.
Taliesin: That makes me happy.
Liam: How high is it to these holes in the ceiling from--
Matt: I'd say it's about 60, 70 feet up?
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Cool, cool.
Matt: Yeah, the whole cavern's kind of domed like this. Alrighty, then, that's Percy's turn. Another lair action's going to transpire.
Sam: Oh. This one's a good one. This one heals everybody.
Matt: Yeah. There is a fissure that erupts over in this side of the room. The ground kind of cracks open and this-- You've seen it happen once. A plume of poisonous gas fills this space here.
Laura: It's okay, we're immune to poison.
Matt: Let's see. I need-- I need you, Vex, to make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: Even I'm immune to poison? Oh, no.
Marisha: Really? Even with Hero's Feast?
Sam: Oh, no.
Marisha: Oh, shit.
Laura: I got plus two for the ring. So, 11.
Sam: Eleven.
Matt: Okay, good, I'll keep that in mind.
Taliesin: That's a number.
Matt: Okay. It is now...
Travis: What does that mean? What does it mean?
Laura: Slowly my skin starts to melt off my body.
Matt: Yeah, you just-- the cloud kind of fills the area and you start coughing, that's it. It hasn't gone your turn yet, so, it is now Raishan's turn. Legendary actions are restored.
Taliesin: I hate all of this. Oh, good, I was worried about her legendary actions. ♪
Marisha: Are you being facetious?
Taliesin: I don't know what that means.
Laura: Who's turn is it right now? -It's Raishan's?
Matt: It's Raishan's turn. Deciding what to do. Okay.
Taliesin: I don't know the meaning of the word.
Matt: Um...
Sam: This is fun. Just good, clean fun.
Matt: Percival.
Sam: Oh.
Matt: As you're running along the wall, and you glance in the vicinity, you see the cloud of poison kind of burst from the ground and you're just out of the range of it. I'm sorry, it's just within your range from where the--
Taliesin: I'm wearing my mask.
Matt: Yeah, you have your mask on.
Taliesin: I don't know if it actually helps, but there we are.
Travis: You look fabulous.
Matt: So, as you're standing kind of amongst this-- this fume, you see this within this, this cloud, a kind of strange burst of very, very faint light in your area and you feel, even in this heated room, a sudden surge of heat within your kind of torso region and then it fades.
Laura: What does it mean?! It's freaking me the fuck out.
Travis: She's blazing us, ya'll. She's lighting us up.
Laura: What if it's like--
Travis: Doesn't Hunter's Mark feel like something sometimes?
Laura: Oh my God, that's right. What if she's like marking us for death or something?
Matt: You now can faintly hear what sounds like... There are footsteps moving through the tunnels, but you're unable in the current chaos and the obscured vision to see where it's happening but there is movement happening above you throughout the cavern.
Taliesin: My save versus magic would not help with this at all. Cabal's Ruin would not help with this. Okay, just check.
Matt: Okay. That ends Raishan's turn. That's gonna bring us to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. Really unsure of what's going on, so I'm just going to...
Travis: Laser pointer right here.
Laura: Laser pointer.
Marisha: Thank you. I'm gonna go to that egg right here that Vax was wailing on.
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: And try and finish it off.
Matt: Okay, you move up and as you get to the edge of it, you can see now the light that your body's giving off. So, the fire elemental is glinting off of piles of gold and platinum that are kind of gathered around the egg. About a third of it is still submerged in volcanic rock and has been placed here for quite some time.
Laura: Don't let me die, I need to loot.
Matt: You can see the crack in the exterior of the egg and the kind of thick purplish amniotic fluid that is slowly dribbling down like a-- like a slow moving molasses or sap from the wound left behind by Vax.
Marisha: I'm gonna do two slam attacks.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Multi attack. Uh, wait. Those were both nine's. Which is-- so 15 total. -To hit?
Matt: Fifteen to hit? It does hit, yes.
Marisha: Okay, and that is--
Matt: Only because he pre-damaged it to that point. You're basically attacking through the shell of the egg. Removed a portion of its armor, so otherwise--
Taliesin: You're punching a dragon fetus right now.
Marisha: I am totally punching a dragon--
Taliesin: That's like so eggs benedict.
Marisha: Plus six, so that's a ten. Fourteen, eighteen damage.
Matt: Okay. So, you plunge your flaming fist into the fluid. You hear it immediately sizzle as your fist goes into it. You punch something dense on the inside. (groaning)
Laura: Oh, you punched a baby dragon.
Liam: Good.
Laura: "Good."
Marisha: Okay, that's my turn.
Laura: In the head.
Matt: You did both of those slam attacks?
Marisha: Those were both-- those my attacks.
Matt: You rolled a 15 and a--
Marisha: I rolled two nine's and I have a plus six.
Matt: Oh!
Marisha: I rolled both of 'em twice.
Matt: Oh, oh, so you rolled 15 both times.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Got you. Then how much damage did you total?
Marisha: Eighteen.
Matt: Eighteen from both attacks?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay, cool. Alright, so, with both slams, the first fist goes in and slams and hits something. The second time you reach in and slamming, you grab it and pull out, as you kind of yank out of the egg just a little bit, you see what looks like the snout of a very tiny Thordak essentially. But whereas the red dragon you saw Thordak, that was like partially volcanic, crystalline with the burning eyes, this creature is seemingly made from pure primordial fire and rock. This is a whole new form of dragon.
Marisha: He made them clones.
Laura: What if he made-- what if it's one for every member of the Conclave?
Marisha: How many are there?
Laura: There's five eggs, but one is crushed and that would be Raishan and there would be nothing in it.
Sam: What?
Marisha: Wait, are we sure there was nothing in it?
Laura: I don't know.
Marisha: Do you want to go check and see if there was something in it?
Travis: Covered in rock, we can't see.
Marisha: Are there five-- there are five eggs?
Sam: Or he was making their own basketball team.
Matt: There are five eggs that you can see currently.
Liam: And they're all red, they're all red.
Matt: They're all red, yes.
Laura: Okay, well, they're all red. Maybe they're all Thordak's.
Marisha: They're little clones?
Taliesin: If they're clones, maybe it's literally five new breeds of dragon.
Laura: Oh my God.
Travis: Only one way to find out.
Marisha: Yeah, only one way to find out. -Let's bust open another one.
Laura: Is it still alive?
Taliesin: What do you call the little chocolate eggs?
Laura: Is it alive?
Marisha: Is it alive or did I kind of kill it by--
Matt: You kind of killed it. It's currently limp in your grasp.
Sam: Hey, you killed a dragon.
Laura: Good job.
Marisha: "I did it! I got one!"
Matt: Keyleth, the dragon snapper.
Taliesin: This is the like the Westworld version of killing a dragon.
Sam: How do you want to do this? Sunny side up. (laughing)
Taliesin: Benedict.
Matt: Perfect. You still have some movement, Keyleth, if you want to move still.
Marisha: I do, don't I. I want to start heading towards Vax.
Matt: Towards Vax this way, okay. What's your movement in fire elemental form?
Marisha: Fifty feet.
Matt: Fifty feet? You get about there, however, unaffected by fire and--
Marisha: And I'm, like, hovering.
Matt: You're comfortable in this.
Marisha: It's like a spa.
Matt: Kinda yeah. -It's tingly.
Marisha: It's like a hot spring.
Matt: It's perfect. Alright, that ends your turn. Gilmore, just at a full run gets up to the side here, and is kind of flanking. He enters the space, pushes up against the wall and just kind of surveys the territory. He looks spooked but also kind of in that, "Well, we're here" type mentality. Looks about the room and goes, "Everyone all right? Please tell me everyone's all right." (coughing) (whimpering) "Great." That ends Gilmore's turn as he just arrives. Grog. (roars) You just come sprinting in.
Travis: Can I smack Shaun's ass as I go by? Going, "Come on, Shaun."
Matt: Sure.
Liam: Shaun breaks in half.
Matt: You aren't stealthy, and as you run by, Shaun sees you about to swing and goes like, "Fine." Whack! Might have dislocated his hip. He's like... (strained laugh) "I'll charge you later."
Laura: That's gonna be a bruise on the ass for sure.
Matt: You get about there and you are-- Pike is technically on your space, kind of clutching to your shoulders. We'll say back here. Little Yoda backpack.
Travis: Do I get any additional movement or am I just here now?
Matt: You are a little bit behind everybody. You've just now caught up to everybody, and that's-- Just your full double run and you just arrived at the edge of the map.
Travis: "I'm here. Let the piñatas begin."
Sam: "Okay, what's a piñata?"
Travis: "I don't know, I thought it was a celebration. -Is it not?"
Marisha: You should ask Sam.
Sam: Hola, me llamo Sam Riegel.
Marisha: Yeah, there you go.
Taliesin: ¿Donde está la biblioteca?
Matt: Alright, that'll bring us to Vex's turn.
Laura: Oh, okay, alright.
Matt: At the top of your turn, the poison has filled your lungs and while you suffer no damage, you are incapacitated. You are just in a coughing fit, almost falling off of your broom. Like sliding off to the side and just... (coughing) And you just can't do anything.
Laura: I can't do anything?
Matt: Nope.
Laura: It was a whole fucking turn?
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Gone.
Marisha: So, both the twins have no turns.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The poison has completely filled you to the point where you're seizing. You feel the muscles tightening up, and--
Laura: It's not hurting me--
Matt: It's not hurting you, but you're unable to do anything.
Travis: Sulfurous gas. It wrecks your shit.
Liam: Welcome to Hot Pepper Gaming.
Laura: That's good, because you know what? I didn't have anything planned and it would have been a cluster fuck like last time, so fuck it.
Matt: Vax. You currently are just kinda like... (gasping) Taking a breath, your vision kind of blurs for a moment and you can see the double vision trying to align. It comes in to focus and you see Keyleth's fire elemental form kind of gliding across. You see the edge of your sister currently shadowed against this cloud of toxic, sulfurous gas that is spewed up from the ground. You can hear her coughing in the distance. You see a bunch of your allies now beginning to just show up on the outside of the room's kind of lit interior, and it takes you the full round to kind of catch your breath.
Liam: No movement either, yeah?
Matt: Let me double check actually. I'm pretty sure... Let me see here. ♪ Can't move or take actions until next turn, so no. Alright, so that ends the end of Vax's turn. Let's see, at the end of your turn. There is going to be...
Liam: This is fucking-- (indistinct whispering)
Sam: Did I--did I get a turn? No, I did mine already.
Matt: Yeah, we're gonna get to yours.
Liam: I'm still in the same position 15 feet up that I was.
Matt: You are, yes. Yeah, your wings are just like... Grog, you see this kind of faint glimmer of energy around you and you instinctually kind of like... (grunts) (growls) But no temperature change. Nothing seems to happen.
Travis: Do I smell anything?
Matt: You smell sweaty gnome on metal armor.
Laura: "Sorry."
Travis: "Honestly, really? I mean, come on."
Liam: "I'm just a little nervous is all."
Travis: "Did you eat mustard pretzels before this, my god?"
Liam: "Maybe."
Laura: "You know how they make me calm."
Travis: Calm?
Sam: Double Ashley is the best Ashley.
Matt: Kima's running, desperately trying to catch up. But she's not quite in the battlefield yet. It's Pike's go.
Liam: Pike, Pike, it's your turn.
Laura: Okay, okay.
Liam: Yeah, let's buff everybody.
Laura: Yeah, so she's gonna cast-- what she should do mass--
Marisha: Is there anything that could help with the stuff that has been magically cast on us?
Taliesin: We don't actually know what's been done.
Laura: Oh, on everybody and it's 30 feet. How far-- Can she move up and get-- How many people can she get in a 30 foot cone?
Matt: A 30 foot cone?
Laura: A 30 foot radius.
Matt: From where she is, it's six squares.
Liam: But she can move forward.
Matt: She can move 25 squares right now. She's been on Grog's back. She can kind of like leap off and--
Liam: But she could get closer to--to Vex, right?
Laura: Vex and Percy and Grog?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: She's right here, she can move this way or this way or wherever you want.
Laura: Let's-- okay.
Marisha: Here, guys.
Travis: Here's a pointer.
Marisha: Laser pointer.
Liam: If she gets near Vex, then she can get Grog, Gilmore, Percy.
Laura: Maybe like in that area?
Liam: Yeah, yeah.
Laura: Or like, no.
Liam: Closer to Percy.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: This-- she'll just be on the outskirts of getting Percy and can get all the rest of you guys.
Liam: Keyleth as well?
Taliesin: She doesn't really need it.
Liam: Why not?
Matt: She can just catch Keyleth.
Laura: Yeah, sweet, that's great. Then she casts Beacon of Hope from there.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: What did that do, oh, that was--
Laura: That gives you advantage on wisdom saving throws, death saving throws, regains max number of hit points for healing.
Matt: Or it would, possibly.
Sam: Oh, shit. There's interferon.
Liam: Gilmore stabs Vax.
Laura: I'm hitting him with the laser.
Sam: Don't blind our DM.
Taliesin: I can't see the die, I'm gonna assume it was an natural 20.
Matt: I'd roll again. There we go, that's we're looking for. Okay. It's a natural 20, so yeah. There is a burst of greenish blue arcane energy that just kind of... around Pike as she tries to cast the spell. The spell fizzles.
Marisha: She got counter spelled.
Laura: Oh! I hate her!
Travis: We're in a no magic zone.
Laura: No, it's just--
Sam: No magic works here. Don't even try.
Laura: Alright.
Travis: Just ruins everything I was gonna do.
Laura: Great.
Taliesin: It's okay, she burned a counterspell.
Laura: Great.
Matt: Scanlan, your turn.
Sam: I move as far as I can.
Matt: You...
Sam: Did I make it in?
Matt: Running up, you're like just on the outskirts. You get caught up right about there in the center of the room. That's as far as you can get.
Sam: Alright. Can I yell out?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: "Where's Raishan?"
Laura: (coughing)
Liam: "Ceiling."
Travis: "I just got here."
Liam: "She's in the fucking ceiling, man."
Sam: "She's in the ceiling?"
Liam: "Yeah."
Laura: (coughing)
Liam: I'm sorry  Alien. Ceiling!
Marisha: They're in the walls. The goddamn walls.
Matt: It would have taken you moving action to get there. You have a bonus if you want to take it.
Sam: Bonus? Bonus, I will-- shit.
Taliesin: You'll shit?
Sam: Bonus.
Liam: True to form.
Sam: No, I'll heal myself again. I'll do a second level.
Matt: Healing Word?
Sam: Healing Word.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: So that's 2d4 plus--
Matt: 2d4 plus six, yeah.
Marisha: Oh, yay.
Sam: Twelve, okay.
Marisha: That's better, that's good. Good job. Good job.
Sam: Gerd jerb.
Taliesin: Gerd jerb.
Sam: Great, I'll take it. Back up to something.
Matt: Perfect. Let's see here. That ends Scanlan's turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Alright, I'm gonna use Animus and I'm gonna take some potshots at that egg that's on the other side of Grog.
Matt: Over here?
Taliesin: Yeah. Is that one of the dead one or is that the--
Matt: That was the one that Keyleth just punched.
Taliesin: That you just punched through?
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Taliesin: Okay, in that case, I'm gonna keep--
Matt: You see no other eggs where you currently are.
Matt: Except the one that's right over here. You could technically fire at the one that's across the way.
Taliesin: I'm gonna actually start walking along the wall. This way as far as I can go.
Liam: Oh, he's sticking to it, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: That's cool.
Laura: Hey, look, an egg.
Taliesin: And I know, like, I'm too close to shoot at that egg, but I can shoot at--
Marisha: It's like an Easter egg hunt.
Laura: But you're above it. Aren't you high on the wall?
Taliesin: Technically, I am far away enough from it that I shouldn't--
Matt: Do you want to go further on here or on this alcove here?
Taliesin: Further like-- like this direction. I want to head this way.
Matt: Okay, so you're moving across the wall. You end at about there at full movement.
Taliesin: Okay, and I'm too close to the egg to get a clean shot at it right now, right?
Matt: Well, I mean--
Taliesin: I've got some height, so.
Matt: Yeah, you could--
Taliesin: I'm using a one-handed, so. I'm gonna fire with Animus. I'm gonna take three pot shots at it with Sharpshooter. Shot number one. Yay, that could have been terrible. -26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Taliesin: Should I just roll all three and then do damage?
Matt: Sure.
Taliesin: Okay. 26, um, 14.
Matt: Fourteen does not hit.
Taliesin: That's fine.
Marisha: Oh, man. ♪
Taliesin: And 16.
Matt: Sixteen does not hit.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm firing really terribly, but that's okay.
Liam: Hanging off a wall.
Taliesin: Hanging off a wall, this is new. Let me get my dice. That's alright. Twenty-three points of damage plus four psychic damage.
Matt: Okay. Alright, so, first shot. It pierces through and actually cracks part of the egg. You can see it's almost like a spider spiral where the egg interior cracks inward. It pierces and a little bit of dark liquid begins to pool out of it. That's as much as you make as the next two shots seem to ricochet off of its hard shell.
Taliesin: Alright, that's my-- Yeah, I'm just gonna use my bonus to reload and take some more shots.
Travis: ♪ Dancing on the ceiling ♪ ♪ Oh, what a feeling ♪♪
Sam: Best music video.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: It's like a piñata. ¿No sé?
Matt: Okay. Suddenly, the entire lair begins to shake.
Travis: Shit.
Taliesin: Goddammit.
Matt: Like this tremor begins to emanate from the ceiling portion of this. Pieces of rock begin to... Fall from the ceiling. I need... The guys who are flying, so, Keyleth, Vax and Vex, don't worry about this. Everyone else, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Even me, I'm barely in the room?
Matt: It's a big radius.
Sam: I got one foot out. What is it dex--?
Matt: Dexterity.
Taliesin: That's better.
Travis: Ten.
Sam: Seventeen.
Taliesin: Fifteen.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Five.
Matt: Five, okay. -Pike...
Laura: Oh, I'm sorry.
Travis: Grog both lose your footing and plummet backward. Gilmore rolls a natural 20, he's fine.
Laura: Hey!
Marisha: Hey!
Matt: "Oh ho. Great dodger, since I was 12." Yeah, Percy, you mange to just barely hold on without losing your the--
Taliesin: Thankfully my spider sense tingled.
Matt: Oh!
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: I almost want you to just go home for that.
Taliesin: Now I'm gonna fall.
Travis: A whole bunch of cheese here.
Matt: Yep. Okay. That ends the lair action.
Laura: Next turn with disadvantage. (laughing)
Matt: It is now Raishan's turn.
Laura: Oh, that was a lair action?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Oh, Jesus.
Travis: We should just call that Raishan's turn.
Matt: Nah. You watch as through the cloud of lightning that's kind of swirling, a small dragon-like form just pierces through momentarily. It's still see-through. You can see the rest of the swirling storm around it, but it's enough of that Predator-like appearance, where it just shapes and shimmies, or shimmers through the vicinity. It shimmies through. As it does, you watch this claw kind of lift up as this low echoing voice... (whispering in foreign language)
Laura: This is all of us with the light. All of us with the heat.
Taliesin: Okay, what is this?
Laura: It's gonna do something, I know it.
Taliesin: We're-- we're all--
Matt: Okay, 30 foot cubes.
Taliesin: We're all just gonna turn inside out and that'll be the end.
Travis: We'll all turn into chickens.
Taliesin: It's gonna be like John Carpenter's The Thing.
Travis: And then the eggs will turn into big chickens.
Liam: First, we'll all mash together.
Taliesin: And then get separated out into equal piles.
Laura: Oh, geez.
Matt: Yeah, 30 foot cube. I can only get-- she can only get Vex, Pike and Grog, but I need the three of you to make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Constitution?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Damn it!
Taliesin: ♪ Constitution ♪ ♪ Come on ♪♪
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: So, that's good. I don't get any bonus though. Twenty-one?
Taliesin: Nice.
Liam: Oh, thank God.
Travis: Twenty-seven.
Matt: Okay, and Pike?
Laura: Oh, oh. You roll for Pike.
Liam: Okay. She gets the meteor. I hope it's good. -It's a one.
Laura: Oh, no!
Matt: Well, Vex and Pike both failed.
Laura: Oh, that's as high as I get without a natural 20, man!
Matt: It's a spell DC of 22, I'm sorry.
Sam: Whoa.
Matt: You and Pike both suffer 57 points of necrotic damage.
Laura: Fucking shit!
Travis: Oh, fuck.
Matt: Grog, you take half as much. So, it'd be 28. Twenty-eight points necrotic damage. Suddenly, you feel the very air itself go gray. The color is taken from your vision and your life force is drawn out of you through Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting.
Sam: Horde wilting?
Matt: Horrid wilting. The air is drawn from your lungs. You feel your skin crack and tighten against your skeleton.
Marisha: Adele Dazeem's--
Matt: Adele Dazeem's Horrid Wilting. (laughing)
Travis: Amazing, yes. Change it, don't ever say it right.
Matt: That's what it is now going forward.
Laura: Man!
Sam: Are you alive?
Laura: No, I'm-- I'm unconscious, so is Pike. -Both of us.
Matt: Oh, shit. Well, Pike is not unconscious. (gasps)
Laura: Pike came back.
Matt: Wait, did her armor get used last battle? -I don't think it did.
Laura: It didn't?
Travis: It got used once, where was it?
Taliesin: Previously, in a previous battle.
Laura: Against?
Taliesin: Fire giant.
Laura: Oh, yeah.
Taliesin: How do I remember this? That's horrifying.
Matt: The fire giant of--
Taliesin: At the battle at the--
Liam: In the fire fort.
Matt: To the fort, yes.
Laura: Oh, at Fort Daxio.
Liam: Yep, yep, yep.
Matt: You are correct.
Laura: Okay, so Pike's alive.
Matt: With how many hit points?
Marisha: Jesus, that was an eighth level necromancy spell.
Laura: No, no, no, she got five hit points.
Matt: So, Pike is at five hit points.
Laura: And are there any eggs within 15 feet of her?
Matt: Nope.
Laura: Is there a Raishan within 15 feet of her?
Matt: Nope.
Laura: Well, then, fuck it.
Matt: But Vex plummets out of the poison cloud off of her broom, slams into the ground and clatters, spinning and falling to the ground not moving.
Laura: Thanks for knocking over the little cube too. I like that added.
Taliesin: Backhanding it, no less.
Travis: Damn.
Matt: Alrighty.
Travis: Are there lasting effects from Adele Nazeem's wilting? Like are we halved or anything?
Matt: From what you know, no.
Laura: "From what you know."
Travis: It just sucks right now is all I know. Everything just sucks.
Sam: Jesus!
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: So, that-- that is gonna end Raishan's turn. The form is still somewhat visible, though, transparent. It took her full movement to even get to that point.
Marisha: And where is she, she still on the ceiling?
Matt: To give you a position, right now... ♪ It's right there.
Sam: Forty, fifty feet up?
Matt: Though transparent. It's 50 feet up.
Travis: Fuck.
Taliesin: Oh, don't do that then.
Laura: Oh, I just remembered.
Taliesin: You left the gas on.
Travis: And she's 40, 40 up?
Matt: Fifty feet up.
Sam: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Matt: So, Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Okay. I can still see her a little bit.
Sam: This is a dragon fight, guys.
Matt: Yeah, you can barely make out the-- the outline.
Marisha: Okay, so since she's in my cloud, I'm going to kind of like, do one of those sideways arcing lightning strikes. Just... and arc everything right towards that bitch.
Matt: Great, go for it.
Marisha: She just takes damage, right?
Matt: For Call Lightning, no, you have to roll-- No, sorry, a creature has to make a dexterity saving throw. So, what's your DC?
Marisha: Twenty.
Matt: Twenty?
Laura: How many lightnings are heading towards her?
Matt: Nineteen. Total of ten plus nine.
Marisha: Yes!
Travis: Wow!
Matt: That's 4d10.
Marisha: Yes, it is!
Sam: Whoa.
Matt: Lightning damage.
Marisha: Yep, yep! 4d10. -Okay, I rolled that.
Taliesin: You rolled well.
Marisha: I rolled okay. I actually rolled-- did roll real well. You're right, I rolled well. Nine, nine, 18. Plus eight, that is 26 damage.
Matt: Nice. You watch as the form tries to pull itself back into the cloud, the cloud lights up with this crackling reddish pink electrical energy that then turns to a bright burning red as it arcs past and slams into her. You watch the energy arc across the body of Raishan, the dragon. (snarling)
Taliesin: Does she have to make a concentration save?
Matt: She does.
Taliesin: To remain invisible?
Matt: Yeah, she's fine.
Travis: "Yeah, she's fine." Fifty-seven.
Marisha: I still have movement, right?
Matt: You do, yes. Your full movement, you haven't moved yet. You just pulled it down in that one moment.
Marisha: I am going to head towards the egg that got cracked open that's in the center there.
Matt: Over there?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. You can go all the way over to it.
Marisha: Can I do a bonus action to like, examine?
Matt: I mean, you can make a perception check and look at it. If you want to rummage through it, that'll probably take your action.
Marisha: Okay, I'll do just a perception check right now.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Twenty-three.
Matt: Okay, as soon as you rush up and get a glance at it, you can see that a lot of the dark, purplish maroon fluid that filled most of the egg is just coating the outside of the egg's shell and there are a series of rocks and pieces of rubble from the initial meteor swam impact that has just sundered this egg. It's about half the height of the others, it's just all that's been kinda collapsed inward. This egg is ruined.
Taliesin: So, we have two ruined eggs at this point.
Marisha: And no sign of a--
Sam: And one almost ruined.
Marisha: And no sign of a dragon baby?
Matt: Nothing you can see.
Marisha: Alright.
Taliesin: Might be just deep in there and flattened.
Marisha: Flattened, yeah, that's my turn.
Taliesin: Could have just been a bad egg.
Matt: Ending Keyleth's turn, that brings us to Gilmore. Gilmore watching this happen, watching Vex go down. Let's see what he does here. (indistinct muttering)
Marisha: Oh, that's funny.
Taliesin: Like five of them in here. Do something about this.
Matt: Okay, as Raishan's form is up there he goes, (sighs) "Not today, not ever!" And releases his hand like this and you watch as a burst of strangely shifting rippling arcane energy similar to the same ripple that is shrouding Raishan seems to kind of scatter up in that direction. He's going to attempt to...
Marisha: Come on.
Matt: With his successful dispel magic, Raishan-- the form becomes completely visible now. The invisibility has worn off. And is now standing completely visible. As this happens, Raishan... (snarls) "I will enjoy eating the flesh from your bones."
Sam: Oh. Did she say "balls"?
Laura: Yeah, definitely.
Matt: Definitely said balls. No.
Marisha: Dragon delicacy.
Matt: Gilmore is then going to... Gilmore goes from excitement to "Shit."
Travis: Not my balls!
Matt: He's going to-- knowing the tactics that are being used, he's gonna try to spread out form the rest of the group. Over here towards the destroyed egg across the wall. That's going to end Gilmore's turn. This brings us to Grog.
Travis: Uh, can I get up, please?
Matt: You can.
Taliesin: Get on up.
Laura: Get on up!
Travis: Can I see Vex sprawled out?
Matt: You do, yes.
Travis: Yeah, can I run to Vex?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: (humming) I have one really-- what's the really big potion? -Is it the Superior?
Liam: Superior.
Travis: I have one of those. Can I shove it in her gullet?
Matt: You can, it'll take your action to do it.
Laura: Oh. You don't have to Grog, it's okay. I mean--
Travis: Okay, I want you to reroll a character. Here we go. I'm going to take my axe and-- Yeah, I shove it in her mouth.
Matt: Superior, that is 8d4 plus 8.
Travis: Oh, I got to roll it?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Oh, gee-- oh man.
Laura: Wait, 8d4. (indistinct) Whoa, 17.
Travis: Twenty-four.
Liam: Plus eight.
Travis: Thirty-two.
Laura: Thirty-two? That was insane, Grog!
Matt: So with that, your eyes come into focus, Vex, as you feel the clatter of glass against your teeth, the vial being pulled from your mouth. You kind of cough for a second. Come into conscious as Grog, in his giant form, cradling you like a tiny baby in his one giant mitt. Just kind of smiles.
Taliesin: It's like a Terry Gilliam movie.
Laura: "Thanks." (snarls) (laughing) Go rage!
Matt: Alright, don't forget you do have a point of exhaustion, as you've gone-- unless you've continued your rage this whole time, which you can, so never mind.
Travis: Yeah, just rolling through.
Matt: You got that now. You're just like a freak.
Travis: I might have chipped a tooth...
Laura: All good. All good, all good.
Travis: Like Mentos and Coke.
Matt: You're like drink it, drink it. Alright, great, that ends Grog's turn. Vex, you are conscious, prone, but conscious.
Laura: God, okay. Fuck. Can I shoot from my laying down position?
Matt: You can, I'd say your attacks would have disadvantage.
Laura: Okay, then I'm gonna get up on my knee and shoot up. Cause I just wake up and see her right above me, don't I?
Matt: Yep, you do.
Laura: Alright, then I'm gonna try to-- Oh wait, I already used Brambleshot, or at least, I tried to today.
Matt: You did, yeah.
Laura: So, I'm gonna shoot her.
Matt: Do it!
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark her first, though?
Matt: You certainly can.
Laura: Hey! I don't get sneak attack. Nobody's near her, right?
Matt: That was-- that was great. Gilmore rolled a 19 on the dispel.
Laura: Nineteen?
Matt: Yeah, that was really good.
Laura: Oh, that's what I rolled.
Matt: Oh, did you?
Laura: As well.
Matt: Nice, look at that, you and Gilmore just synchronizing.
Matt: And 19's your total?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Misses.
Laura: Fuckin' A. That one, I hope, 28.
Matt: Hits.
Laura: Okay, so 28 on the second one. Oh God, what's happening?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: Sixteen plus three points of lightning.
Taliesin: I'm not gonna play that game, man. Not playing. I'm not playing this game no more. It's not the time.
Matt: Did you include your damage for it being a dragon?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Alright. So now you can see Raishan emerging from one of the volcanic caves. The storm's swirling around her, as she begins to pull back into it, you fire two arrows. One gets lost, the other one-- (snarling) Into the side of her throat.
Laura: Can I move-- can I move...
Matt: You move three squares.
Laura: Can I get on my broom?
Matt: You get onto your broom, yeah.
Laura: Like move a one square away.
Matt: One square?
Laura: Yeah. Away from Grog and Pike, yeah. Like that makes any difference, but--
Matt: Okay, perfect.
Taliesin: It's a start.
Laura: Thanks, Grog.
Travis: (snarls)
Matt: Ends Vex's turn, Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, just to clarify, so looking at the minis. The back side's to me, but really, her face is poking out of a hole, right?
Matt: Like the front half is.
Liam: Front half of her and she's-- and she's at the roof which is 70 feet up, so maybe her head is down, like, five feet out, ten feet out, something like that?
Matt: Roughly, yeah.
Liam: Alright, I want to, and I'm--I'm back, right? -After...
Matt: You have now-- Yeah, you've regained your composure. However your other potion has now worn off. -You are no longer--
Laura: Invulnerable?
Liam: I want to fly--
Laura: Oh!
Liam: Go ahead.
Laura: My hasted had worn off, right? I just assumed it had, okay.
Liam: So, if I'm 15 feet up and she's, maybe, 65 down, I'm within range for sharpshooter already.
Matt: Technically, yeah.
Liam: So, and-- and last question. When you do-- for duel wielding, action-- bonus action, but you told me once you can reverse that and do bonus action and action. I think.
Matt: The bonus attack is part of your attack action, so it's actually after your--
Liam: Never mind then. I'm gonna fly straight at her face, and I'm gonna shove the Dragon Slayer sword into her mouth and I want to try to sever her fucking tongue out of her mouth.
Sam: Oh!
Laura: Whoa!
Liam: Terrible. Whisper, I'm gonna do the same thing with the bonus action. That is 26.
Matt: Twenty-six to hit, that hits. ♪
Liam: Ten plus four, psychic damage 14.
Matt: Fourteen points of damage. Okay, so you go for the tongue and you get the blade up to the mouth. Suddenly, her looking down and having a very, very wide view of the entire battlefield is very advantageous from her perspective. She sees you out of the corner of her eye, she turns to try and snap at you, and the jaws come down and catch the blade. So, it doesn't go for the tongue, but you use that momentum to glide it up the actual tooth and jam it into the gum. You manage to slam up there and the blood spurts out from the wound and-- (snarls) Rears back and so now you're kind of flying up by her face now.
Liam: I should have like 10 or 15 movement left with 60 for wings, yeah? If I was 15 feet up and she was a little less than 70?
Matt: Fifteen feet up, yes, but you're also coming at an angle, which, you lose distance on that.
Liam: So am I at zero?
Matt: You're pretty much at zero, yeah.
Laura: Ooh, like right in front of her face.
Travis: Just stay there like Tinkerbell.
Liam: Okay. All done.
Matt: That ends your turn.
Travis: You are grounded.
Matt: At the end of your turn, she's going to use another legendary action. To do a tail attack against you. She pulls part of her torso out for a moment, and her tail whips out in your direction to try and slam into you. That is a 19 plus, what is it, 32.
Liam: Don't think that hits actually. So I'll use Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: That's gonna be 24 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to 12, so there you go. Alright, that brings us to Kima's turn. Kima finally arrives.
Marisha: Kima!
Sam: Hey!
Travis: Slow poke!
Matt: "Seriously?" That's her turn.
Travis: That Holy Avenger's real heavy.
Matt: So that brings us to Pike. Actually, no at the end of Kima's turn, let's see here. Raishan's gonna use another legendary action to attempt another tail attack against you, since you're within range. -That is a...
Liam: 10,000.
Matt: Twenty-one to hit.
Liam: Shit, it just hits.
Matt: Just hits? Okay. Seventeen points of bludgeoning damage. Yeah, go and halve that. She's used all of her legendary actions for this round. Okay.
Travis: All legendary-- did you hear that?
Matt: Pike.
Travis: Pike's up.
Laura: Okay. I think we should do... But okay, if she does Flame Strike can she focus it on the ceiling? Or does it have to be on the ground?
Matt: No, it can-- I'd say-- let me pull it up real fast here. It roars down from the Heavens in all locations, so it doesn't come out of the floor, it comes out of the ceiling, so yeah.
Laura: Okay. So, it's her level five spell.
Liam: Okay, aim it at--
Laura: At Raishan? At Raishan's butt, not at Vax.
Matt: Raishan currently, only visible, is about maybe 10 feet or so of-- actually pulling out the tail attack, I'd say about 15 feet. So if she's careful, yeah, she could probably hit Raishan and not hit Vax.
Laura: Pike is always careful.
Travis: So careful.
Laura: She's the carefulest.
Matt: Fair enough.
Laura: Okay. So, wow, that's a really big-- Sixty feet, damn.
Travis: That's good shit.
Laura: So, that's 4d6 plus 4d6 radiant.
Matt: It's gonna be close. Yeah, roughly about 55 feet up on the ceiling. With that 60 foot range, she can just hit Raishan with the column, so yeah.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So that is 8d6 damage.
Laura: Okay, wow.
Matt: Go ahead and roll that. Raishan makes a save--
Laura: I roll five and you roll three.
Matt: So a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Oh, just kidding.
Matt: Twenty-seven, I'm pretty sure that saves.
Laura: No, I want to roll some. I roll, I'll roll three. You roll five. ♪
Liam: Eighteen.
Laura: Thirteen.
Matt: And also makes a concentration check from your attack earlier.
Laura: Thirty-five.
Sam: No.
Laura: No.
Sam: Thirty-one.
Laura: Thirty-one.
Matt: Thirty-one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: So half that to 15. Fifteen points of damage.
Marisha: Benefit of the doubt.
Matt: Alright, cool, got it.
Laura: Why half?
Taliesin: She made her saving throw.
Travis: At 27.
Matt: Sorry. So, you just barely move out of the way as you watch a familiar gathering of radiant energy up in the ceiling. You see the glimmer in the corner of Raishan's slick eyeballs recessed within the green armor-plated face. of the dragon as all of a sudden-- A great column of fire and radiant energy blasts Raishan in the side of the face.
Laura: And she's gonna back up towards the opening towards the entrance a bit. -Yeah, like right there.
Matt: Right there? That's as far as she can get right there. Cool.
Sam: Does she have a bonus action?
Laura: She's got a bonus action.
Sam: Heal herself?
Marisha: Is it Healing Word?
Laura: Oh, yeah, she can, right? 'Cause she can use a level two or less. So, yeah, she'll do a level-- she doesn't have any level two's left. She'll do a level one Healing Word on herself.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, God, she's at five hit points.
Sam: Yeah, I know.
Taliesin: Not anymore.
Laura: She's--she's Pike though. This is what she would have done.
Taliesin: She's now at--
Laura: I think.
Taliesin: What does the level one Healing Word do?
Sam: It's 1d4 plus five or something like that.
Marisha: It does an additional d4.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Right? No, sorry, just one d4.
Laura: One d4 plus five, so yeah, seven.
Taliesin: So, she's at 12 hit points now.
Sam: Double dig!
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: That's better.
Marisha: Double dig!
Taliesin: That's--
Sam: What's that look, Matt?
Travis: Seven points of healing, so yeah.
Matt: Cool, does that end your turn?
Travis: Yep.
Liam: Yep.
Matt: Good, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Okay. I don't know, man, this looks rough in here. I don't want to be in here. (laughing) I'll move forward and to the left a bit.
Matt: That's about as far as you can go.
Sam: Sorry, to my right. To the right, four to the right. Oh, man. It's a rough fight. But we're winning, right, now, guys? We're winning, we don't need any help, do we?
Laura: (gasps)
Liam: Did you forget?
Laura: I totally forgot!
Marisha: How could you forget? It's like all I've thought about.
Travis: I will cuddle you, I will cuddle.
Laura: I even wrote--
Taliesin: He's not gonna do it until Ashley's dead.
Laura: I wrote a limerick.
Marisha: Ashley is almost--
Sam: You wrote a limerick?
Laura: For you.
Sam: For me? To do what?
Laura: Wait, wait, I forgot I did it. "Have you heard tale of Scanlan, the bold? He won't tell us his age, but he's old. With his blade, he's a slayer, with the ladies, a player, but if he picks up the flute, he's pure gold."
Marisha: Hey! (applause, laughing)
Sam: Alright, so I'm gonna do Lightning Bolt.
Laura: Goddammit! (laughter)
Sam: I will-- I assume that Scanlan feels strange with a brass flute touching his lips, because he's never played one before.
Matt: This is true.
Sam: But does it still come out just as beautiful and pure as always?
Matt: Roll a performance check.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: I'm so nervous, I'm about to cry.
Sam: Thirty.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: In the midst of this chaos, the rumbling of the room, the sound of the lightning and thunder in the clouds, the falling of rock and soot from the ceiling is drowned out by what sounds like the most beautiful clear flute. It just trills... (whistling)
Sam: ♪ Call the dragon ♪ (all humming) ♪ Call the dragon ♪♪
Matt: You finish the song as you watch the brass glow. It begins to kinda give this-- this weird shine around it that begins to emanate this kind of additional warmth and light from it and then it dulls and the brass goes to a very tarnished dark metal material.
Taliesin: It's Amazon Prime. It's gonna take three days but it's gonna be here.
Sam: I've played better.
Matt: You watch the flute ping in the hallway behind him. -So that's your action.
Sam: Okay. As a bonus, I will-- Boy, everyone's dying, right?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: Pike's near me, so I'll turn and give her a level two Healing Word.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: As well. And I will sing to her: ♪ I've got Mythcarver in my pocket ♪ ♪ Got that sunshine on my feet ♪ ♪ When I dance and prance around you ♪ ♪ You just stop ♪ ♪ Hoo! ♪
Marisha: ♪ Hoo! ♪
Sam: ♪ And I dance so very handsome ♪ ♪ And I sing phenomenally ♪ ♪ There's just something bout that gnome ♪ ♪ That makes me smile ♪ ♪ Woo! ♪
Marisha: ♪ Woo! ♪♪
Matt: Alrighty.
Matt: Pike takes her inspiration die.
Sam: Uh, no, not inspiration, healing, healing. So, wait, I got to roll or she rolls?
Matt: You roll for her.
Sam: Okay, ooh. Oh, boy. (groaning) (laughter)
Sam: Eight.
Matt: She heals eight points.
Sam: She's up to 20!
Taliesin: She can almost drink.
Marisha: She can drink next year.
Matt: Alrighty, ending Scanlan's turn, brings us to the top. Percival, your turn.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to... Yeah, this is fine.
Sam: ♪ Can't stop ♪♪
Taliesin: I'm going to-- this is fine. I'm going to take some shots with Animus at that awful bastard at the top of the cave. First shot, and I'm not making it a sharpshooter shot, I'm just shooting. That's good too. Oh, that's not bad, 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Taliesin: Alright.
Laura: Look at all those pots of gold in the corners.
Taliesin: That's 13 points plus five points of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And another shot.
Travis: Shot.
Taliesin: And that's, uh, that's-- Oh, that's not bad. That's two points of psychic damage to me.
Matt: Oh, buddy!
Sam: He's already unhinged.
Taliesin: So that's 54. So, that was like thankfully, just an ow! I'm just putting it away. I'm just gonna try and pull-- pull out the big gun and take one last shot while I'm-- while I'm-- well, actually, no, that knocks out my attacks, doesn't it? Cause it's a psychic damage.
Matt: Well, I was gonna say, the psychic damage doesn't negate your attacks.
Taliesin: I don't have time to switch guns. No, cause the psychic damage knocks that out if I recall.
Matt: No, psychic damage doesn't affect the way--
Taliesin: So, do I have time to just try and get one more potshot out or am I--
Matt: Was Bad News prepared?
Taliesin: It was fine, it was working fine.
Matt: It was fine.
Taliesin: Yeah. Nothing's broke, well, now...
Matt: Now it is, yeah.
Taliesin: Now that's broken, okay. So, and now Bad News, here we go.
Liam: Come on, Golden Snitch! Do it!
Taliesin: Natural 20!
Laura: Yes!
Travis: On cue! (cheering)
Taliesin: Thank you, baby. Okay.
Matt: So, that'll hit.
Taliesin: Yeah, let's-- let's take-- Let's take--
Sam: Weird critical things here?
Taliesin: I don't do any weird critical thing other than doing a lot of damage.
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: Although, where's my-- I do have, okay, so-- That does a lot of damage. (talking over each other)
Marisha: Amazing.
Taliesin: Double dice.
Travis: Come on, you deranged--
Liam: Find one thing and do it well.
Taliesin: Not bad, okay, that's-- 31 points of damage.
Matt: Alright.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Matt: Very nice.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's 4d12, plus six, so. And now I'm gonna hide behind that dragon egg.
Matt: Alright, so you move behind the dragon egg right there.
Taliesin: Yep. Oh, and that means I get a grit point back ah-ha! I can actually do a thing, that's good. Okay, alrighty.
Sam: So, things are turning around ever since that limerick.
Liam: Watch this, I'm gonna get turned into pulled pork right now.
Matt: Well, it's the lair actions now. So in this one...
Taliesin: The Earth itself turns against us. (rumbles)
Matt: From beneath your feet, Grog, you feel and you look down just as the rock splits and a spray of-- a tiny geyser of molten rock just sprays outward. You try and move out of the way in time, but sprays across you, Pike, Scanlan and Vex. So I need you guys all to make dexterity saving throws.
Laura: You want to make it for me?
Sam: Natural 20, 25.
Matt: Whoo! That'll do.
Taliesin: There's nothing natural about 25. Purely artificial, you've had work done on that 20.
Sam: This is LA.
Taliesin: This is LA.
Marisha: Lot of LA things right back to back. -It's overwhelming.
Taliesin: Man.
Travis: 21.
Matt: 21? Succeeds.
Laura: Twenty.
Matt: Succeeds, Pike?
Liam: Eleven for Pike.
Matt: Pike does not succeed.
Sam: 20, 25.
Matt: Succeed, alright, so, you guys who all succeeded, you take 12 points of fire damage. Half of you are resistant.
Sam: So six.
Matt: Just six. Pike takes 12 points of fire damage because she's resistant even though she failed her save.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, that's good. That's good.
Laura: So she's still up.
Sam: She's still alive!
Taliesin: She's still alive.
Sam: Because of me, let's just go on record and say that.
Taliesin: I'll go with that.
Liam: Can you say it in Spanish?
Sam: No, I cannot.
Taliesin: Pike.
Sam: Yo no soy Marinado. Alright, that brings us back to Raishan's turn.
Laura: Oh God, oh God.
Matt: Gets her legendary actions back.
Travis: It's cool, you can just go.
Matt: Given the current circumstance...
Taliesin: No. No.
Matt: Raishan is going to unleash...
Travis: Handshake?
Matt: She's going to unleash a full round of attacks against you as you are right up in her face and stabbed her in the gums and avoided the entirety of her meteor swarm and you also attacked her.
Taliesin: In defense, she had some corn stuck in her--
Laura: Yeah, he really was helping. It'd been there for like--
Matt: And she appreciates that, but the rest of the stuff is still a problem.
Taliesin: I'm trying not to say anything.
Matt: That is 22 to hit with a bite.
Liam: That just hits, Uncanny Dodge.
Sam: Maybe you should remind her that we have a deal. We're supposed to be working together.
Matt: 22, well, yeah, so they all hit.
Sam: What happened to our deal, Raishan?
Liam: The first one is Uncanny and then the rest are--
Matt: Correct, so the bite attack is halved. Which is good. That'll be 22 points of piercing damage and you got the warm tingle earlier, right? You also suffer ten points of poison damage.
Sam: Ten points of poison?
Laura: Even though he's immune to poison?
Matt: He's not immune to poison.
Laura: He's not?
Matt: No.
Liam: Not from that-- so that our Hero's Feast does nothing.
Laura: It was Dispel, she dispelled our Heroes' Feast. That's what that fucking shit was.
Travis: Oh!
Liam: Is that the total--
Matt: That was the bite attack. So that whole attack is halved. The poison damage and the piercing you took is halved. The claw attack...
Sam: There was a shimmering and you didn't feel anything.
Matt: 26 points of piercing damage.
Liam: Vax is falling. (gasps)
Sam: Oh, no.
Matt: And the tail bats you on the way down. You guys watch as the darkened wings of Vax go limp and he just plummets.
Marisha: Oh, boy.
Sam: That's gonna be--
Matt: Roll a d20.
Laura: Oh, God.
Liam: Is this a death save?
Matt: No, this is a trajectory.
Marisha: Oh my God, please don't land in the lava.
Matt: You smack right into the edge, but not into the magma river. You hear the cracking sound of bones breaking upon impact and the wings themselves broken. Feathers falling and burning within the molten rock. The wings slowly fold in and curl like a spider dying and vanish.
Liam: That sucks.
Sam: Forever?
Laura: No, not forever!
Taliesin: He just went unconscious.
Matt: And with that...
Taliesin: Something's gotta be done about that.
Travis: You are Anakin on the riverbed.
Marisha: Totally.
Taliesin: Magma is practically like your arch nemesis to be fair.
Liam: I don't-- I don't know.
Matt: Raishan is going to move. (pieces crash) (shouts)
Matt: Kima, no!
Marisha: Poor Kima!
Sam: Bye. I just got here! (indistinct talking)
Matt: Alrighty. And as she emerges now, after knocking you out of the air, wings fully out, Raishan... (snarling) "You're next." And then swoops over and is now floating over the lava pool over that way. And appears to be preparing for something.
Liam: Have I got any automatic fails in a death save?
Matt: Yes, you did fail a death saving throw from hitting the ground.
Liam: Hitting the ground?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: As she does that, I yell out, "Could you be more specific? Who is next, who? Oh, we didn't see who you were looking at over here. No? Alright, guess we'll find out."
Travis: I was so preoccupied, I missed it.
Matt: That ends Raishan's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay, so Keyleth, pretty pissed off from seeing her boyfriend spiked from the sky. I'm going to kinda get a few, well, no, I guess I can stay here. Kind of above the lava create a swirling angry lava vortex of lightning and fire and I'm gonna hit her again with lightning.
Matt: Okay. Make her save. Save 12 plus nine that is 21, which does save.
Marisha: Yeah, she saved.
Matt: So takes half damage, so 14 then halved.
Marisha: Okay, not too bad. Twelve, 14 plus seven, 21 total. Half damage.
Matt: Okay, so ten points of lightning damage.
Marisha: Not great.
Matt: Okay, did you want to move or you gonna stay where you are?
Marisha: Um...
Taliesin: You can't heal as a bonus action, can you?
Marisha: No, I can't do anything. Does-- does Vax look like he's about to fall in the lava?
Matt: Vax is approximately one foot from the edge of the river.
Sam: One third my size.
Travis: Is it flat or is it...
Matt: It's slightly domed in.
Marisha: Do you have flame resistance right now? Yeah, you said you're flame resistant.
Taliesin: On the armor.
Marisha: Okay, so I'm gonna use my movement then. I'm gonna be very careful to make sure I touch the armor, the Raven Queen armor and I'm going to see if I can just fire elemental like roll him away from the edge a little bit.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: The armor is set to flame resistance.
Matt: Yes, it is.
Travis: I thought you were saying you were gonna like roll him in the lava.
Marisha: It's been nice. (talking over each other)
Matt: I will say-- I will say the touch of a fire elemental ignites whatever it touches. It's kind of the essence of the element.
Marisha: But he has fire resistance.
Matt: Right, which means he'll take half damage from any fire that you deal. However, being the fact that you are in control of your form you're not trying to hurt something, I would say that you could carefully push him aside and I'll allow you a death saving throw as opposed to just taking straight damage.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: I'm making a--
Liam: I'm rolling an advantage.
Matt: An advantage because of your armor, yeah.
Liam: Twelve, succeed. So, we're good, we're good.
Marisha: We're cool, we're good.
Sam: Here, let me help you. Oh God, I killed him.
Liam: I feel like in another dimension this didn't go so well.
Matt: So you kind of roll him over...
Marisha: That would be the most Keyleth thing to do. I love you so-- oh God, I killed the thing I love.
Sam: Oh my God, George, I hugged the puppy really hard.
Liam: No, no, no!
Marisha: I'm sorry, George.
Matt: You barely move him, you only get him five feet from being so careful. You could have moved him further, but he would have-- been ignited in the process.
Travis: Oh my God.
Taliesin: I got that extension so bad.
Matt: Does that end your turn?
Marisha: I'm gonna then take a few steps back away from him now.
Matt: Okay, back this way, back where you were?
Marisha: Yeah, yes.
Travis: You would have turned into a vestige.
Taliesin: I don't got to pretend I'm (indistinct).
Matt: Okay, that ends your turn?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. At the end of your turn. Raishan is still overhead and casts a spell.
Liam: Duvet, Duvall?
Travis: Duvet.
Matt: Alrighty. You watch as Raishan over on the edge... her front claws begin to form this strange geometric sigil in the middle of the air and each corner of it is a different color. Green, orange, yellow, red, purple, blue. And suddenly this giant burst--
Sam: Can I try to counterspell her?
Matt: What's the range on that?
Sam: 60 feet, am I just there?
Marisha: Come on, Scanlan.
Laura: Oh God, Scanlan.
Travis: What is she casting?
Matt: She's within range!
Laura: Oh, God!
Taliesin: Please, please! Please kill it!
Matt: d20 add six.
Sam: Eighteen.
Matt: You rolled an 18?
Sam: No, I rolled a 12.
Matt: You rolled a 12, that's an 18 total? It is a... Hold on a second.
Taliesin: God, I can't breathe.
Matt: I'm pretty sure...
Sam: I get a plus two for--
Matt: Right, oh, I know. The sigil-- as the burst of colored light begins to spray forward, you watch as it just... (cheering)
Laura: Scanlan! MVP!
Liam: Vax wakes up for two seconds, says, "You da man!" and then lies back down. (laughter)
Matt: Shit. I never get to use Prismatic Spray.
Travis: That was a day ruiner, right? Day ruiner. (talking over each other) There's no chance that was like a healing spray, was it?
Liam: Probably not.
Travis: Like the gesture of surrender?
Liam: It was kind of like rainbows.
Taliesin: It's the angriest Captain Planet-- it's just the worst--
Marisha: Like the most fucked up Care Bear stare.
Matt: Alright, so, as the spell dissipates... Raishan angrily...
Sam: ♪ You got eggs and you gonna lose 'em ♪ ♪ You got eggs ♪♪
Laura: Oh God.
Matt: Alright, so that ends-- that ends Keyleth's turn. That brings us to Gilmore. Now, Gilmore over here is-- what else does he have left in the tank here? He's gonna do a level four Lightning Bolt.
Taliesin: Chromatic spray.
Sam: Chromatic spray could have been many things though.
Taliesin: Yes, but they're all bad. -It's a wheel of death.
Sam: And they're all bad. One of them's like 70 points of...
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Of just-- just goop.
Marisha: Each color is like bad.
Matt: Gilmore is going to...
Taliesin: It's a great way of dealing with people who are-- who are attuned to deal with you. (indistinct talking)
Taliesin: You were looking at that for a while.
Sam: Yeah, I was, it was good. -It looks good.
Taliesin: It's really good. -It's very you too.
Sam: Rainbow colored.
Matt: Sorry.
Laura: Check out those Gilmore t-shirts.
Matt: I know, sorry, I'm checking to make sure he can do this cause this is what he's trying to do.
Liam: Gilmore's wearing one right now.
Sam: Hey, Laura, are those key chains laser etched?
Laura: Why, they are! It's so funny you should ask.
Sam: Wow, what about the--
Laura: So precise.
Sam: Did I say the key chain or the necklace? What about the necklace?
Matt: So, Gilmore-- Gilmore runs up. And just vanishes from his place and instantly blinks up over into this area using his misty step as his bonus action. And looks upward. "How do you like it?" Raises his hand and pulls this way. You watch as this necromantic energy begins to gather around his hands. A familiar spell to you, Keyleth. As you watch the diseased blackened veins up the side of Raishan's body begin to spread and grow momentarily and kind of begin to-- to dig their way into her throat. She begins to pull backward, unfamiliar with this sudden internal pain. Rolls a natural 20 for her save. But regardless, that's still--
Laura: I like how he genuinely looked kind of disappointed though that he rolled a 20.
Travis: I think he's just--
Laura: It made me-- it made me feel great.
Liam: He's a really good actor.
Sam: See, we're not even gonna need the flute guy.
Laura: I hope he shows up. I hope he's not like...
Taliesin: No, a month from now he's gonna show up.
Travis: Attacking like his carry-on?
Sam: He's at TSA right now. "I have nothing else metal on me. I don't-- oh, I'm bronze."
Matt: Seventeen points of necrotic damage to Raishan with the save. That's Gilmore's turn there. That brings us to... Grog.
Travis: Me?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Your dragon-based humor is way too tight right now.
Travis: Can I run over with Shaun?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I attach the Chain of Returning to the axe?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Then, can I swing it really hard and go, "Yeah, catchphrase!" and throw it up. (laughter)
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Good, reckless, please.
Matt: Yes, you may.
Sam: Laura.
Travis: That's a natural 20.
Marisha: Whoo!
Matt: Oh, shit! Alright.
Travis: Oh, and with the brutal critical, I get two additional...
Matt: Yeah, two additional d12's to that, so roll the die first. Plus don't forget you double the necrotic die.
Travis: Yeah, I do double it?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Yes!
Travis: That's a six, so that's 12. I'm enlarged. Where's the triangle, who took the triangle?
Laura: I don't-- here you go.
Taliesin: You got like valley girl on that. "Who took the triangle?"
Travis: That's 29 and then two additional d12.
Matt: Correct.
Travis: Nine, 38. Ten, 48.
Matt: 48? Okay.
Laura: Did you double those extras? Do you double those dice as well?
Travis: No.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Brutal critical, you get two additional damage die on my roll.
Matt: Okay, so, as you rush up, "Catchphrase!" and throw the axe sideways. It arcs upward and Raishan is currently kind of reeling from the dispel and angrily yelling into the room in draconic. Gets partway into a phrase, just finishing... (roaring) The axe just jams into the side of her collarbone and front torso area and... The axe is still kind of wedged there, are you gonna pull back?
Travis: Yeah, I'll pull it back.
Matt: So go ahead and roll your...
Taliesin: I don't know why you're looking over here for that.
Travis: Yeah, I got it. 23.
Matt: So, yanking the axe, dislodges itself and you catch it. You see it's covered in Raishan blood. As you pull the axe back, you watch as something just, like, a flash of arcane energy around her, and some sort of spell, uncast by her, just seemingly automatically just kind of surrounds her and her flying begins to speed up.
Laura: She got hasted?
Marisha: But how?
Laura: How?
Travis: I didn't know I was this powerful. What the fuck happened?
Laura: How did she get hasted?
Liam: Well, we'll find out.
Laura: What if the brass dragon's helping her?
Taliesin: Or what if the eggs are helping her?
Matt: Yeah, you have maybe 15 more feet.
Taliesin: I don't know, I just like putting things out there.
Travis: Rolling towards that end of the map as far as I go.
Matt: This end, sure.
Laura: That end of the map.
Travis: Can I go that way? Yeah, that's cool. -Cool.
Matt: Great.
Laura: Oh God.
Matt: That puts you at the end of your turn. She's gonna use legendary action. At this point in her kind of, sped up form, she begins to... (chanting) And there's a slight ripple again in the air similar to what Gilmore did towards Raishan early part of the battle. Let me see the...
Taliesin: We're making some bad groupings there, by the way, people.
Matt: Yeah. You feel a kind of a strange warmth and tingling sensation within your body, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, what, me? But I didn't do anything.
Taliesin: You relieve yourself gently.
Laura: Did you just pee?
Taliesin: I cast Tinkle.
Sam: I don't get to save or anything, it just happens?
Matt: It's not a save, it's against an effect on you and she rolls to-- just like how you roll to overcome her spell's counter spell, she gets to roll to overcome whatever effect is on you with dispel magic.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: So, that's gonna be the last of her legendary actions.
Laura: She just dispelled all of us. Can we bust out a feast right now? -Just like sit down.
Taliesin: We can make eggs benedict. We have the makings for eggs benedict.
Sam: Does that dispel my fire resistance as well?
Matt: No, it only affected the Heroes' Feast.
Sam: Okay. You'll have to explain that sometime.
Matt: Vex, you're up.
Laura: So, giving a potion to somebody is a full action?
Matt: Yes. Cause you have to basically get there, open it, grab them and help them swallow it to have the effect take place. It's a pretty involved action.
Sam: That means we don't have advantage on death saves either. Right, wait.
Laura: Did we ever?
Sam: Yeah, we did.
Laura: Oh, that's from Beacon of Hope. That's gone anyway.
Sam: Is that gone, okay?
Taliesin: Yeah, that got eaten.
Laura: Okay, then I'm gonna fly down to my brother. And I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on him at fourth level, so that's 4d8.
Sam: 4d8? ♪
Laura: Oh, 19 plus eight, wow, 27.
Sam: Wow.
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: You don't got no wings anymore.
Liam: She dead?
Laura: No.
Liam: Oh, shit.
Laura: Get away from the lava. And then, I'm gonna fly away from the lava. -Up.
Matt: This way?
Travis: Towards Matt.
Laura: Yeah, towards Matt. Up and towards Matt.
Matt: Up and towards me.
Laura: Kind of away from Pike. Actually, let's go, oh God.
Matt: This way?
Laura: Yes, yes, what you just did. That way.
Matt: That's about as far as you can go right there. Okay.
Laura: And I get a bonus. I can do something with a bonus. I'm gonna re-Hunter's Mark her.
Matt: Yeah, cause you--
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Alright, so Hunter's Mark reapplied.
Laura: Oh, wait! I can take a potion for myself as a bonus.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: I'm gonna do that.
Matt: Alright, go for it.
Taliesin: Yeah. -Get it.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Just a regular potion?
Laura: Just a Superior.
Matt: Oh, right.
Laura: That my brother gave me.
Matt: That is an 8d4 plus eight.
Laura: It's a four.
Travis: Easter egg.
Laura: Seventeen plus eight.
Travis: You have one more dice to roll.
Laura: I do?
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Ooh. So, 21 plus eight, so 29.
Matt: Nice.
Sam: You healed yourself that much? Jesus, that's a big potion.
Laura: Yeah that was, I rolled really well.
Taliesin: I may make one for the table.
Laura: I didn't trust that I would roll that well.
Matt: That ends your turn, Vex?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, so half my movement just to get to standing, right?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay, I'm gonna throw Whisper, Flame tongue. Raishan should be within 60 feet, yeah?
Matt: Uh, yeah.
Liam: Okay. -Seventeen for the first.
Matt: Fails.
Liam: Second is 22.
Matt: Twenty-two just hits.
Travis: That's it, that's Raishan at 22.
Liam: Ten.
Taliesin: 22?
Marisha: She's 22.
Matt: How much damage?
Liam: Ten.
Matt: Ten points damage.
Liam: And I'm going to use my remaining 15 of movement to go diagonally away from Raishan.
Matt: Diagonally away this way?
Liam: Away from-- diagonal.
Matt: Here?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, that's as far as you can get there. Okay. That ends your turn. That brings us to Kima. Let's see. Kima rushes in with Holy Avenger, and looks over at the distant dragon and goes, "Oh, shit. Who's hurting?"
Laura: Everyone.
Sam: I'm fine.
Laura: "I am, I don't want to say anything though, but I kind of am. I feel kind of shitty. I--I feel like shit."
Liam: "Um..."
Laura: "Um..."
Sam: "I'm kind of bleeding from my ears, but, whatever."
Matt: Kima as an action is gonna cast a...
Laura: "I can deal with it. It's no big deal."
Matt: I'm gonna say third level Cure Wounds.
Liam: Matt, my wings are toast, right?
Matt: Yeah. That's 17 points of healing to Pike.
Laura: Okay, thank you.
Matt: I think Kima's just gonna go at a full run. (indistinct talking) Right, that ends Kima's turn. There is a flash of light in the tunnel behind you guys. As a sudden burst of kind of... a whitish orangish energy that briefly halos Kima, Scanlan, and Pike's forms. As you watch, a brass talon... (cheering) A brass talon, that since it was used as the top of our tree, I forgot to bring its base, but he'll be acting there.
Taliesin: It was a beautiful tree.
Laura: Hey, look, he's standing!
Marisha: He's standing.
Taliesin: You've been drinking, brass dragon.
Laura: Oh, J'Mon, you looking good.
Liam: J'Mon!
Laura: J'Mon!
Taliesin: Have you been working out? You look like you've been working out.
Matt: He watches as they arrive and kind of bully their way past the entrance. "I was wondering when you'd call."
Sam: Glad you came!
Travis: Nothing cool, nothing cool with that!
Taliesin: Swipe right, swipe right!
Travis: Sure is glad you're here!
Sam: We're happy to see you?
Travis: No court speak here.
Sam: How-- how was the flight?
Matt: Actually, I broke my platforms, so I'll just have to use my imagination for some of this.
Sam: We need modeling clay, quick!
Taliesin: Fishing wire, we can just string it from the top of the set.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, just attach it to a string.
Matt: There we go. J'Mon, they kind of stomp their way into the room, stepping over you, Scanlan. Stepping past you, Vax. Nestles in, kind of surveys the territory. "A different color than I was expecting." And releases a blast of fire breath upwards in the direction--
Travis: Smoke 'em if you got 'em. C'mon, J'Mon.
Laura: ♪ J'Mon ♪
Taliesin: ♪ J'Mon ♪♪
Matt: That is a 23. Okay, makes the dex save, so Raishan pulls out of the way with a benefit from the haste spell. However it does still take damage. Half damage from the spell. That's 16d6 damage.
Laura: Wow.
Travis: 16d6. Well, that might actually help.
Liam: Nobody expects the Marquette inquisition.
Matt: That is 58 points fire damage, half of that to 20... 29, whoo, pardon me.
Laura: Did you just burp or did you just--
Matt: I did.
Matt: Twenty nine points of fire damage to Raishan from Devo'ssa's Flame breath. J'Mon Sa Ord, as you know.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: She makes a concentration check. Succeeds.
Travis: Damn it.
Matt: So, the haste remains viable. Okay, that ends J'Mon's turn. Pike is up.
Laura: Okay. Pike...
Marisha: Go on, girl!
Laura: She's gonna cast Mass Healing Word. Can she get the most people in her radius?
Matt: What's the range on it?
Laura: It is a 60 foot radius.
Sam: Radius?
Matt: Yep, that's the biggest radius, it'd be right there. In the center, just under J'Mon's giant brass dragon wing.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: It's not gonna heal Raishan, is it?
Laura: No.
Matt: No.
Laura: Heals only people she wants. It's up to six creatures.
Matt: Up to six creatures, who do you choose?
Laura: Who all's--
Taliesin: Raise your hand if you would-- you would like to be--
Laura: So, that's--
Liam: Grog is within range.
Laura: Grog and her. So, that's Grog, Pike, Vex, Vax, and Percy.
Sam: Well, hey, if you can do six.
Laura: And Scanlan. "Oh, sorry, Scanlan, I didn't see you there."
Sam: "Well, I'm behind a dragon, honey, it's okay."
Laura: Oh, he's gonna dispel this shit.
Taliesin: I don't think she can.
Laura: Okay, she's gonna do this.
Sam: Wait, can she do it on herself as well?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Nine.
Sam: Nine-- nine points?
Laura: Yeah. That's a bonus, I know, I know, okay.
Taliesin: Nine is good.
Laura: There's not really anything else right now.
Taliesin: Technically, it's 9 times 6, so you did a lot of healing.
Laura: All of her major spells were used.
Liam: Still in the game.
Taliesin: Nine times six is a lot.
Travis: Nine points, okay.
Taliesin: That brings me up into the 60's.
Sam: Decadent.
Marisha: Just a-- a nice southern California day.
Taliesin: Fifties.
Laura: And then, can she-- does she have any movement left?
Matt: No, that was her full movement to get there. (indistinct talking)
Laura: That's true. She's gonna duck as much as she can under J'Mon.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: For protection. And say, "Oh, you look very nice, thank you." (laughing)
Matt: There you go.
Laura: "Thank you for helping us."
Sam: At this point, I feel like you guys are better at Ashley than she is.
Laura: No, shut up.
Matt: Alrighty.
Taliesin: Cast of thousands it takes to play Ashley.
Matt: Ending Pike's turn, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Oh, oh, shit, I should have been thinking about what I--
Matt: Yes, you should have.
Sam: Okay. I will-- I will-- I will shoot some stuff at Raishan of it all.
Matt: Do it, what are you doing?
Sam: I'm gonna shoot Lightning Bolt at Raishan. From my dick. (laughter)
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: So, as you begin creating your incantation and thrust your hips forward, J'Mon Sa Ord turns their head beneath the wing in your direction and arcs a brow, surprised.
Sam: Like, yeah, this is happening.
Matt: As the bolt of energy streaks forth from your groin in the direction of the dragon. That is a 15. It's going to use one of Raishan's legendary resistances to resist it. So half damage.
Sam: Okay, fine, whatever.
Travis: "Fine, whatever."
Sam: Okay.
Travis: ♪Feel the heat.♪
Sam: Wow.
Sam: 35 halved.
Matt: 35 halved.
Sam: 17.
Matt: That's a good roll.
Sam: That is a good roll. It was mostly sixes and fives.
Matt: Alrighty. And do you wish to move or you gonna stay where you are?
Sam: Oh. No, I would like to move. I would like to move forward a bit still within the-- the Devo'ssa range.
Matt: Like by Pike and Kima over here?
Sam: Yeah, oh, can I move to the other side of Devo'ssa?
Matt: Yeah, you can move just underneath, running between the legs and get about there.
Sam: And yeah, shoot, is anyone else-- how's Gilmore look?
Matt: Gilmore is standing and seems to be doing alright, but seen a lot struggle from the last battle and is currently about... You can see a little bit of blood dried and curling from one side of the mouth. Hair is mussed up and looks to be a few burn marks across the skin and is kind of a little out of breath, but is standing.
Taliesin: It's the level two Mike Tyson's punch out.
Matt: Yeah. Gilmore's roughly half out.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: I knew that would break you.
Travis: I love that reference.
Sam: So I will use a Healing Word on Gilmore. Why not? 'Cause I don't want to use any-- I got one more Inspiration, so I'm not gonna use that yet. So, yeah, I will-- I will heal Gilmore.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, yes, sorry, I got to roll. Nine.
Matt: Total nine, great, alrighty. That ends your turn?
Sam: Yes, yes, yes.
Matt: Alright, Percival, you're up.
Travis: Nice job.
Taliesin: Okay, I don't have it marked down that I burned my action surge, but I think I burned my action surge.
Matt: You did, yes.
Taliesin: But I still do have two points of Cabal's Ruin. -If I recall.
Matt: You do, yes.
Taliesin: Okay, just making sure. Alright, so, I'm going to-- from my little vantage point, take a shot with Bad News. See how this goes, and I'm gonna burn a Grit for advantage. Let's do this. ♪ Yeah. I mean, that wasn't fine, but we could do better. Yeah, that's already better.
Travis: Come on.
Taliesin: Thirty points to-- 30 to hit.
Matt: Thirty does hit, yes.
Taliesin: Alright. Let's use these, they're sparkly. Two 12 plus six plus, I'm gonna throw 2d6 worth of electric. 2d4 worth of electric. Learning how to use-- Oh, 1d6, no, never mind, here we go. So, let's add. Empty out Cabal's Ruin. That's awful. ♪ 10 points of damage plus 6 points of lightning damage.
Travis: How's that terrible, that's not terrible.
Taliesin: For me.
Laura: For him.
Matt: You watch as you send the last bit of the charge through the cloak as the energy shoots up your arm into the gun and as you fire, it travels with the bullet and bursts into this kind of weird, reverse shock wave and the energy returns and slams for a second time into Raishan's body.
Taliesin: Nice, I have one more shot. So, I'm gonna take my last shot although there's no more electricity. That's probably not gonna hit. That's 18 to hit, that does not hit.
Matt: It does not.
Taliesin: That does not hit. But at least it doesn't backfire.
Matt: It hits the side of the hide and ricochets off the dragon's skin.
Taliesin: I'm gonna start running. I know you don't have the little plastic thing, but I'm feeling a little clumped over there, so I'm gonna start running up the wall at an angle, so probably three up and three-- three up and three side.
Matt: We'll mark you at 25 feet up on the wall. Just keep that in mind. Okay, ends Percy. Top of this now is another lair action. ♪ (indistinct talking)
Sam: No, he could do that.
Matt: Alright. ♪
Taliesin: It's like watching some very, like, complicated...
Marisha: Like, chess.
Matt: The magma over here begins to bubble and you watch as one of these strange protrusions from the rocky ground begins to bow upward and then crack open as another familiar cloud of gas begins to spill out in this area.
Travis: But you're totally immune.
Matt: Vax, Vex, Scanlan. I need you guys to make constitution saving throws.
Sam: Nope.
Laura: This is just the worst.
Matt: J'Mon.
Laura: ♪ J'Mon ♪♪
Matt: Does make it, yes.
Sam: Four.
Laura: Fourteen.
Liam: Eighteen.
Matt: Okay, you do make it.
Liam: Eighteen.
Matt: Eighteen, yes, the two of you manage to succeed. Pike as well?
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, medicine won't heal it.
Laura: Hold on.
Travis: That's gotta make it.
Liam: Thirteen.
Laura: Fourteen.
Matt: Okay. So, this cloud is still kind of permeating this area. Obscuring it slightly. Ending that now it is Raishan's--
Sam: Wait, what did I do, what happened to me?
Matt: You rolled a four.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: So, when your turn comes around next...
Sam: I die.
Travis: I'll let you know.
Matt: No, you'll just be coughing and incapacitated. The coughing fit that this poison gas creates is so bad that you can't do anything but hack.
Travis: It is called LA Smog.
Matt: Yes. Now, being Raishan's turn. Still hasted, pardon me. Raishan is going to dart backward... and snatch up this one egg with her claws. Grabs it and kind of carries it up underneath.
Marisha: Bitch cares.
Laura: She does care!
Marisha: She cares!
Laura: Let's kill them eggs.
Taliesin: Care Bear stare!
Sam: Wait, maybe she's just trying to be a good mom.
Taliesin: She's gonna throw it at us.
Marisha: Google Donkey Kong.
Taliesin: She could go all Donkey Kong on us.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah. (indistinct talking)
Laura: (yells)
Matt: So, that's 20 to get there and back to grab that. She kinda swoops down, grabs it. Moves forward ever so slightly this way, and... No, from back here. Is going to release a giant burst of poisonous gas outward, affecting-- Kima shrugs it off, Pike shrugs it off. Grog, you shrug it off cause you resist the dispel that didn't work earlier. Gilmore ate the Feast earlier and is also unaffected. However, I need...
Laura: Gilmore didn't get the Feast.
Matt: That's right, cause you can only have so many people eat from it. Alright, I need Gilmore, Vax, Vex and Scanlan to all make constitution saving throws.
Sam: What about Devo'ssa?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Wow. That's not happy. Such a pretty die.
Laura: Did you say Pike? Did you say Pike as well?
Matt: Pike didn't get dispelled. So Pike is immune.
Sam: I got a nine, Matthew.
Matt: You got a 9?
Sam: Constitution?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Nine.
Matt: Not you, Percy.
Taliesin: I didn't have to roll. I'm just mocking him.
Matt: Vex?
Laura: Fourteen.
Matt: Okay. You guys and Scanlan all suffer 83 points of poison damage.
Travis: Oh my God!
Marisha: How many?
Matt: Eighty-three.
Laura: Eighty-three.
Matt: Gilmore.
Taliesin: (laughing) Gilmore makes his save roll with a 19 plus three.
Taliesin: So, he gets 40.
Matt: Thanks to your heal earlier, Gilmore is still standing with two hit points.
Laura: Wow.
Sam: That makes two of us, friend. I'm at two hit points as well.
Travis: How y'all doing?
Laura: We're unconscious.
Sam: Did our-- Our bronze brass dragon get hurt at all or no?
Matt: Brass dragon. But it is here in a minute. Rolls a one on its saving throw. Gonna use legendary resistance to make the save. So he only takes-- they only take--
Taliesin: Can you arc lightning?
Matt: 41 points of damage there. Okay. So, as this billows forth...
Laura: Twins go out together.
Matt: So, Vax, he falls unconscious. Vex, you fall unconscious, fall off the broom, hit the ground. Taking four points of bludgeoning damage, you suffer a death saving throw from the impact.
Laura: From like a teeny little ten foot fall?
Matt: 10 foot drop on your head.
Laura: That's fucking stupid.
Matt: It's only a--
Laura: She was sitting stupidly!
Matt: It's only a d6 bludgeoning damage, but when you're unconscious while falling, you now realize the downside of flying all the time.
Laura: Damn it!
Travis: Didn't you put air bags on that thing?
Laura: I did, I have a helmet on. Did you-- I put airbags in the witch's hat.
Taliesin: It's a football helmet.
Travis: That's right, it's magic, it goes...
Sam: Yeah, I forgot to tell you, the witch hat is magic.
Taliesin: Full of balloons.
Matt: As the poisonous breath billows out and everyone's coughing and falling over, you watch the twins fall unconscious, Raishan kind of grins. "You've got a few surprises, I see, but you're not the only ones."
Laura: Oh, no, does she have more surprises?
Travis: I think that's what she meant, yeah.
Laura: I hope that's not--
Taliesin: There's cake and ice cream upstairs.
Sam: "I have more surprises." "Guys, I think she has more surprises."
Travis: That's literally what she just said.
Laura: I just thought maybe the breath was the surprise.
Matt: And then is going to use the rest of her movement to whip over here.
Travis: Damn it, damn it, damn it. Why'd she have to leave? I just wanted to give her a high five.
Taliesin: You need to heal the living hell out of these people.
Laura: Damn it! She's carrying...?
Matt: She's carrying two eggs underneath.
Taliesin: Which means she obviously can't do claw attacks.
Matt: She still has 40 feet of movement.
Laura: That's true.
Matt: And is going to turn back, and flies there.
Travis: Didn't pick up anything else?
Matt: No, she grabbed the two eggs and is positioning. Alright, that ends Raishan's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Taliesin: Can you heal?
Marisha: I'm wondering if I should drop this and start doing beefier stuff now.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I think now's the time.
Sam: This has only injured Vax so far, so...
Laura: Me and...
Taliesin: The twins, they're both unconscious.
Sam: Oh, great.
Taliesin: With one death saving throw already failed.
Sam: Great.
Laura: No, just me.
Marisha: Okay, I am going to move from--
Laura: And Pike's like out.
Marisha: Over the lava like this direction.
Sam: She's got some cantrips.
Marisha: Geez, I can't tell.
Matt: Which way?
Marisha: This way, this way. See the laser pointer? No, no, no, I had it. I had it and it went away. -Okay.
Matt: Over here?
Marisha: No, it's-- yeah, over there.
Matt: Over here?
Marisha: Uh-huh. And how far away is Raishan from me now?
Matt: I'd say roughly 30 feet, 35 feet.
Marisha: Okay, move me like one more closer to her.
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: And how close am I from the twins now? I can't see.
Matt: Twins, you're about 30, another 35 feet from them.
Marisha: Okay, let me move five more feet so I can be within 30 feet of the twins.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Okay, now I'm gonna drop my--
Matt: Well, with both twins, you'd have to move there. You drop your form?
Marisha: Drop my form.
Matt: Alright.
Marisha: I hope this is not a terrible idea.
Matt: I'll put you there.
Taliesin: We're at that point.
Marisha: We're at that point. This is Dungeons and Dragons!
Taliesin: This is dungeon and dragons.
Marisha: I'm going to bust out the Spire of Conflux. So I'm gonna bust out the staff and be like, "You bitch." And then aim it. I'm gonna do chain lightning and can I try and hit her and the two eggs and maybe like, since I still have the storm going, like, it just looks cool? (laughing)
Matt: Sure.
Laura: Doesn't it--?
Matt: Raishan saves. The eggs cannot save technically, so go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Don't you get the lightning attacks too? If you're doing chain lightning, you still get the other lightning's that are there?
Marisha: I have to choose to make an action. It's still there, but I can either like do other things or choose to do--
Laura: I understand.
Marisha: Sorry, I don't do the-- 10d8.
Taliesin: Do you need some d8's?
Marisha: I have one, two, three, four, five... I think I'm good, I'll just roll five twice. Oh, God, oh, God. Did she save?
Matt: Yes, she did.
Marisha: But the eggs didn't?
Matt: The eggs did not.
Marisha: Okay, that's not phenomenal. Three, six, nine, ten-- nine, ten, eleven. Plus four is 15 plus... Okay, okay. What'd I say, 15? Twenty-five, 29. Thirty-six total.
Taliesin: Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Marisha: Oh! Oh, and I get to reroll this one. Thirty-six, no, thirty-eight.
Matt: Thirty-eight, okay. That would be 29, no, sorry. No, from 30, 19. Nineteen damage to Raishan and the two eggs-- You watch as the bolt hits, arcs through her, arcs through the eggs. You see the eggs still carrying them, no visual.
Marisha: It didn't do anything to 'em?
Matt: Well, nothing you can see, no.
Marisha: Nothing I can see. Maybe I like microwaved 'em inside. Like nuked 'em. Might have nuked 'em.
Travis: Might have been like Vision and you made 'em super strong.
Marisha: Yeah, or I turned 'em into little Vision dragons. You know, one of the two. Okay, and then for my bonus action, I'm going to do a Healing Word on Vax.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm just gonna do it at first level. -Sorry.
Liam: No, hey.
Taliesin: It's back up.
Marisha: Three plus (indistinguishable) so nine total.
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: At the end of your turn, watching you form over, hit her with lightning, hit the eggs and all of a sudden, breath come back to the lungs of Vax on the ground. Raishan, "Not so fast." Still clutching the eggs, her front claws kind of form this small spiral as the air grows surprisingly cold causing this mist to form around the extended ends of her claws. As she puts her arms forth, casting Cone of Cold outward from her.
Laura: I wonder if they're elemental, like, amplifiers.
Marisha: The eggs?
Taliesin: I think, I think maybe they're--
Travis: Just eggs?
Taliesin: No, no, I think she may be on to something.
Matt: That's going to be... I don't know if it's going to hit.
Taliesin: No, no.
Matt: Does not hit Gilmore. However, I need Scanlan...
Sam: Would I be able to counter spell this or-- or am I already in a cloud of smoke and coughing?
Matt: Oh, you can't technically move cause you're doubled over.
Sam: I'm already in the cloud, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: You're in the cloud, but you can be restored. Cause you've been backed up.
Sam: Oh. Backblaze?
Sam: You're slowly becoming me tonight.
Taliesin: Can Gilmore dispel or-- Just throwing that out there. I know you're playing a lot of hands here.
Sam: You're so handsome and charming all of a sudden.
Matt: What's the range on that? Unfortunately, Gilmore's just out of range. 60 foot range.
Taliesin: Goddammit, okay.
Matt: Good looking out though.
Taliesin: I'm trying.
Matt: So that is Kima, Pike, J'Mon, Scanlan, Vax and Vex all making constitution saving throws.
Laura: I'm unconscious.
Matt: So, you take another death save.
Laura: Cool.
Taliesin: Goddammit. We need to fix that.
Laura: I've got one save left.
Taliesin: Please, we got to fix that.
Sam: Did I-- wait. Vax-y poo, did I give you my cold armor? I mean, Vex-y poo.
Laura: Yeah, you did, but it's not attuned.
Sam: You're not even using it?
Matt: And even then, even at half damage, she's unconscious.
Laura: Well, I am, I'm just not getting cold--
Matt: So you're at two death saves on impact. You're unconscious again to zero. -You take...
Sam: I rolled an 11.
Matt: An eleven, yeah. So you take 43 points of cold damage.
Sam: I'm so dead.
Travis: No, no, unconscious.
Matt: Unconscious.
Laura: You're unconscious.
Sam: Negative 41.
Matt: Both roll for Pike.
Laura: It doesn't matter what you're negative.
Travis: Unless it's your total hit points.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Roll for Pike if you could please.
Laura: Well, I wouldn't count it, but yeah, that was-- that was bad. It was better when I--
Taliesin: Well, not anymore.
Laura: What is this, what is this? Constitution, what is this? Five! Cause I suck.
Matt: Pike takes another 43 points of cold damage.
Laura: Pike is unconscious.
Sam: The gnomes are down. Well, at least we got Kima.
Laura: Whoa. The two-- the twins and the gnomes are out.
Sam: Yeah, whoa, we're down four?
Taliesin: We're down four.
Sam: Whoa!
Laura: This is serious, you guys.
Sam: Don't worry, Devo'ssa's here to give one shot of 28 points of damage. Come on, Devo'ssa, do something!
Travis: I would hit the dragon cause it's low enough, but it's on the other side of the map.
Matt: Alrighty, so that's the end of Keyleth's turn. It's now Gilmore's turn.
Travis: Come on, Gilmore.
Laura: Do you have Mass Cure, Gilmore?
Matt: Gilmore does not cure, unfortunately, that's not his specialty.
Travis: What about Razzle Dazzle?
Matt: He's used a lot of his spells. (sighs)
Taliesin: I have nothing.
Travis: Can he cast like--
Sam: Oh, wait! Shit. No, that was poison. He shot-- Raishan shot poison at us, right?
Taliesin: No, cold.
Laura: Cold the last time.
Sam: No, the cold this time. The previous time it was poison.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Never acid though.
Taliesin: No, never acid.
Matt: Gilmore rushes around J'Mon almost as a defensive stand point, but also kind of taking in the circumstance. Watching this blast of cold air come through. Kind of looks around, seeing everyone on the ground. It's like, "Oh God, oh God." And in a fit of rage and needing to lock this down, just gonna go ahead with what he has left at his disposal to release a... All he can really do is a lightning bolt. Which Raishan rolls a one.
Laura: Oh, good, good.
Matt: Uses legendary resistance to resist it.
Laura: I have to pee so bad, I got to get up.
Sam: How do you want to do this?
Matt: I know. Ten points of lightning damage to Raishan.
Laura: What I'm scared of is that I'm gonna be away from the table when I actually die, but I have to pee.
Matt: Go pee, it's fine.
Laura: Just don't kill me while I'm not at the table, okay, Matt?
Matt: Do my best.
Sam: Hey, when she gets back let's all be crying.
Laura: (offscreen) Don't-- I heard that! (laughter)
Taliesin: You are the worst person. Two seconds longer.
Matt: Grog.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Actually, no, oh, thank you so much.
Taliesin: Oh, yay.
Matt: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Beautiful. They found my base.
Taliesin: Wow, look at all those minis that are flattened. Wake up our healer.
Matt: Look at that. Looks much more majestic when it's up in the air. Oh God. I'm juggling here. Stay on there! Alright, so, at the end of that turn... there's two more legendary actions from Raishan. She has four, she has four. To cast a Melf's Acid Arrow at Gilmore. ♪
Sam: (snickering)
Travis: Wait, where did Gilmore go, I can't see.
Matt: He's underneath.
Sam: No one said D&D was easy, guys. ♪
Matt: Okay, a ranged spell attack. So, yeah, that hits. So that is 4d4 acid damage against-- That's five. Five, ten points of acid damage. Gilmore is now also down.
Sam: Oh!
Travis: Is that five total?
Taliesin: Five down, we have five down.
Matt: As Gilmore runs past the dragon, Raishan just with this almost underhanded, flips her claws out and this one little greenish dart of arcane energy slams into Gilmore's chest. And he just falls to the ground.
Taliesin: We're so fucked.
Matt: Burning into him like alien blood.
Travis: This is some kind of horrible record.
Laura: Gilmore just went unconscious too?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Travis: Sit down.
Laura: Oh, no!
Sam: Kima, Percy, Keyleth. It's up to you.
Matt: Grog, it's your turn.
Sam: Oh, wait, Grog! I forgot Grog.
Travis: Hey!
Taliesin: Is there anything you can do to fix this?
Travis: I have a question.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: So my speed is 50, but I don't know if I ever thought of what my speed is enlarged-ish. It's not double, right? I don't really have a card for it. It doesn't say anything about my speed.
Matt: Wait, for which one, on the--
Laura: If he was enlarged.
Matt: If you're enlarged, no, it doesn't increase your speed at all.
Travis: Yeah, okay.
Matt: You're still 50, you're bigger--
Taliesin: Fuck.
Travis: So, from where I am, if I wanted to head towards you, how far could I get?
Matt: You could get... That far there.
Travis: That does fuck all.
Taliesin: That-- yeah.
Travis: I could throw the axe but Pike's unconscious. -I'm gonna run to Pike.
Sam: Start saving shit.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And I have the middle potion available.
Laura: The Greater?
Travis: The Greater.
Matt: Alrighty, so you're gonna use your action to administer the Greater healing potion to Pike. Alrighty, go for it.
Sam: To Pike.
Travis: How many-- How many is that, I don't remember.
Laura: That's 4d4.
Matt: Yeah, 4d4 plus four.
Travis: Okay. Four. Four, that's two. Hey, seven and a four is eleven. Fifteen. Fifteen points to Pike.
Matt: Fifteen points to Pike.
Taliesin: And she still has her turn coming up.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Oh, okay, okay, that's good.
Laura: But she has basically no spells left.
Sam: She's got no spell slots. Does she have any spell-- higher level spell slots open?
Laura: She's got a fourth level spell.
Taliesin: And then she can burn a fourth to heal somebody at a fourth level. She can heal you at a fourth level because you need healing now.
Matt: That ends your turn, Grog?
Matt: Vex, it's your turn. I need you to make a death saving throw.
Taliesin: Goddammit.
Laura: I could die.
Taliesin: Yep, this could be it.
Sam: This is the last one?
Laura: This is my last death saving throw.
Taliesin: This is it.
Laura: No advantage, no nothing.
Taliesin: Oh God fucking damn it.
Laura: I'm using-- no, I'm not even gonna say it. (groans)
Laura: I failed it.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: Five.
Matt: Five. There, on the banks of the lava flow in Thordak's lair, the breath escapes Vex. Her body going still and unfortunately not cold because of the vicinity of the flames, but Vex has fallen.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: Death save.
Matt: With advantage.
Liam: I made it.
Matt: Made it? That brings us to Kima. ♪
Travis: Fuck. ♪
Sam: Holy shit. ♪
Matt: Kima, who's-- Pike is now conscious, correct? From the potion.
Laura: Pike is conscious with 15 points.
Matt: Kima's panicking watching all this happen and seeing this happen in the distance. Looks to Gilmore, looks to Vax. She kind of frustratingly just throws the sword at her side and reaches down and does a level two Healing Word to Gilmore. That is 12, so Gilmore is back and conscious.
Marisha: As a bonus action, so can she heal someone else?
Matt: Alrighty. That ends Kima's turn is now--
Marisha: Does she happen to do-- that's a bonus action. Can she do it twice?
Matt: That was-- that was not Healing Word, sorry, Cure Wounds.
Taliesin: Goddammit.
Matt: She's going to move, stepping over his body, "Keep it going, friend." Leaps over him. Two, three, four, five. And she kind of runs past, pulling the sword out again, looks up at the dragon and says, "Alright, show us what you can do, buddy. There's a lot riding on this." After Kima is J'Mon. They look down at the running Halfling. "Dire as it may be, that's why we're here." Let's see if he gets his breath back. Nope. They did not get their breath back.
Travis: Shit.
Laura: Just-- bitch-- bitchslap Raishan.
Marisha: Kaiju battle!
Liam: Take your earrings off, come on.
Matt: Rushes up and-- Goes right up into Raishan's space.
Laura: Yes!
Sam: Dragon on dragon.
Laura: He has a base now? When did that happen?
Travis: While you were peeing.
Laura: That's great.
Matt: So, just rushes up into Raishan. You feel the wind kind of blast past as the wings of J'Mon Sa Ord, Devo'ssa, pick them up and they rush around strafing the side of Raishan and unleash a barrage of attacks against her. That will be-- First one is 16, no. Bite misses. Three and a two, really?
Laura: Really?
Travis: No, no, no, no.
Marisha: Come on, man.
Travis: I don't believe it.
Marisha: Come on!
Travis: I don't believe.
Sam: Look at all the notes, look at all the notes.
Travis: I don't believe it!
Matt: Three, two and one. That is ridiculous.
Laura: You know why this happened? Cause you took so long to call--
Sam: Yeah, I know, I know. They got-- they got bored waiting at home and yeah.
Matt: So.
Sam: It's me, it's on me.
Matt: As J'Mon rushes up and unleashes, Raishan, who is slippery at best, and really, really, really creepily deceitful at her worst, dodges to the side, so, she's in the shadows and the cloud of the storm in the air to kind of hide her form as J'Mon reaches out and starts slashing Raishan, who's now has this kind of wild look in her eyes of now mounting victory. From a moment of fear earlier, she manages to avoid the first two strikes and the third one, the tail slaps against the side of Raishan's body. Whack and smacks to no effect.
Travis: Jesus.
Matt: That ends J'Mon's turn. It is now Pike's turn.
Liam: Pike, how close is she to--
Sam: Book!
Taliesin: Book?
Matt: Pike is about 25 feet away.
Liam: She's gonna run up, kneel down, wait, kiss Vex on the forehead, and say, "Not like this, buddy," and cast Revivify for her last spell.
Travis: It is her last.
Matt: Revivify is touch and she's coming up from unconscious prone which means she doesn't have the movement to get there to touch her.
Liam: Pike is unconscious?
Matt: Oh, no, she was-- she was--
Travis: Pike was not unconscious.
Marisha: She was not unconscious, she was up.
Travis: She was up with 15--
Matt: Oh, oh.
Laura: She had 15. -But she was--
Sam: She was lying down.
Laura: She was lying on--
Matt: So, she was prone. She was prone.
Travis: Oh, why didn't I just pick her up?
Matt: No, so she can move. She can't get there.
Laura: That's okay.
Matt: It's a touch spell.
Liam: Who's she near?
Marisha: How much time does Revivify need?
Laura: A minute.
Taliesin: Oh, under a minute. Oh, well, she can make her way--
Laura: She's got Sprinter's Boots on! She just texted.
Matt: Had she used them recently?
Laura: We didn't use them in the last fight because we didn't realize she had 'em.
Matt: The internet will let us know.
Laura: Well, I-- we didn't use 'em in the fight with Thordak.
Liam: She didn't know she had 'em so we didn't use 'em.
Matt: Right, right, so.
Sam: Do you have any other healing spells that can work at a distance?
Liam: She's dead.
Marisha: She's dead. She's gonna do Revivify.
Laura: For Pike, though.
Taliesin: Yeah, like.
Liam: So the Sprinter's Boots do nothing, I mean, I don't know.
Matt: The Sprinter's Boots will let her double her movement for a round.
Liam: So will she get there?
Laura: She's writing in all caps "Sprinter's Boots!" (laughing)
Liam: Alright, so Revivify.
Matt: Alright.
Taliesin: Oh my God.
Matt: Now, this is mid-combat. -For the purposes of this--
Laura: Oh God.
Sam: How long does it take to cast?
Liam: It's instantaneous.
Taliesin: Less than six seconds.
Liam: One action, instantaneous.
Marisha: Yeah, she did lay out less than six seconds, man.
Matt: I understand. So, this-- this is going to be a rapid resurrection skill check.
Laura: Oh God, really? Okay.
Matt: So, but this is only from Pike because it is a singular roll. So.
Laura: Can Ashley roll, do you want to roll Ashley?
Matt: As Pike rushes up, what does Pike utilize to implore Vex's soul to return?
Sam: Liam, you answer. ♪
Liam: My gosh. She grabs a dagger out of Vex's belt and cuts off a lock of her hair and presses it into Vex's hand. "It's not time, it's not time for you. No." ♪
Matt: Go ahead and just roll a d20.
Laura: She's-- oh! Oh, no! Should we read that?
Travis: No.
Matt: A ten? As the glow from the outside of her form that just radiates with the armor itself, centrally focuses itself into her holy symbol and is sent down the arm. Each piece of the plate mail glowing in succession like a series of chained lights as it reaches the fingers, touching the bottom of her fingertips to Vex's torso. The air seems to go dark for a moment around her body before it pulses, and with that, you watch as her jaw moves ever so slightly taking in, once more, the warm air of Thordak's lair.
Marisha: No one else die.
Matt: Pike, want to do anything else? Bonus action?
Liam: Geez, I don't--
Laura: Oh, she should take-- she should take a potion or something.
Travis: Yeah, heal herself please.
Laura: She's got a-- she's got a Greater healing-- Pike has a Greater healing potion that I know of. So she can take it.
Matt: Okay. So that is a 4d4 plus four.
Travis: This sucks!
Taliesin: I'm almost of the thinking that she shouldn't take it just because-- -Well, no, she's got--
Laura: She's got 15 points.
Taliesin: Well, I mean, but anything hits her-- half the things that hit her are gonna even kill that and that's a revive from death.
Laura: That's true.
Marisha: Yeah, but it's on her, right? Yeah, I see what you mean though.
Laura: Should she wait, should she hold it?
Sam: They're in control of her.
Taliesin: Yeah, you do it, you do it, you do it. I'm overthinking this.
Liam: Yeah, we're talking about getting people back up. At this point, not healing cause any hit is lethal. So getting someone on their feet.
Travis: I got some potions cause I never use 'em, but...
Matt: Yeah, you guys have been hording potions for a while. You've been burning through all of them from these two encounters.
Travis: I've got all the ones I've never used.
Liam: Who's on the ground by Grog?
Taliesin: You.
Liam: No, I know I am, but who else is that?
Taliesin: It's Scanlan, Scanlan's on the ground still.
Liam: Is someone up besides me?
Laura: Well, I want-- it's an action if she-- if she gives it to anybody else. She can't, she can only take it as a bonus action for herself.
Travis: Go.
Liam: Go.
Laura: Oh, that's really good though.
Marisha: I wonder how bad Raishan is looking.
Taliesin: He hasn't said the phrase.
Laura: Nineteen.
Matt: Okay, nice. Alright, at the end of Pike's turn, Devo'ssa, J'Mon Sa Ord, is gonna use two legendary actions to attempt a wing attack.
Taliesin: Thank God.
Travis: Come on, come on.
Matt: He is now like just assailing Raishan with their wings. So, Raishan has to make a dexterity saving throw. That is cocked, try again. No, that is a failure. Raishan's gonna use the last legendary resistance to resist that. So instead takes...
Travis: Fuck!
Matt: That's...
Marisha: She's burned through all of her legendary resistance?
Matt: Seven points of bludgeoning damage and is not knocked prone. That would have messed her up. Okay.
Travis: Is not knocked prone?
Matt: No, she is not, she's safe. Okay, that brings us to Scanlan.
Laura: We just gotta get out of here.
Sam: Fail.
Matt: That's a death saving throw off Scanlan. Alrighty, that brings us to the top of the round. Percy, you are in the back of a wall.
Taliesin: I'm taking...
Matt: The curse of the unscathed!
Taliesin: You know, I was gonna take shots at the eggs, but I give up. I'm taking just shots at Raishan.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: Come on. Don't be stupid. -That's stupid.
Marisha: Pretty stupid.
Laura: Oh my God, we're all gonna-- I'm not gonna say it. -We're gonna--
Travis: Don't you-- shh!
Laura: We're gonna get through this, you guys. We're all gonna get through this.
Travis: ♪ I gotta get through this ♪ ♪ I gotta get through this ♪ ♪ I gotta get ♪♪
Taliesin: Yeah, so I've got-- that's a-- that's a-- -That's a gun jam.
Marisha: Fuck.
Matt: Really?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: Fuck.
Taliesin: Hold on.
Laura: Oh my God.
Taliesin: That's a bad gun jam. I'm talking bad, they're both bad gun jams. Alright, I've got one weapon left that can just barely make it, so I'm just screaming to the world. Here we go.
Matt: So you're pulling out Retort.
Taliesin: Yeah, Retort is out and that's a 23.
Matt: That hits. Two more attacks on that, right?
Taliesin: Only one more because I took an attack with Bad News.
Matt: That's-- well, Bad News takes an attack to reload.
Taliesin: But-- no, the first shot went--
Matt: Right, but usually, it's action.
Taliesin: Right, so I have two more-- I have two attacks with Retort. -So, that's--
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That's um, oh, that's nice. Fourteen points of damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And... Oh, that was so mean, that was almost a natural 20. -Twenty-four.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Ah, 16 points of damage.
Matt: Nice.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: Let me take some concentration checks on that. Yep and yeah.
Taliesin: And I'm going to reload, and I'm going to start running across the wall away from the fray.
Matt: Around this way?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: So, you get about there.
Taliesin: That far. Getting out of the way.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn. It is now back to a lair action.
Sam: Great.
Travis: Fuck.
Matt: The ground in the center here quakes and cracks open as a familiar burst of magma-- -Everyone in this vicinity.
Laura: Goddammit.
Matt: I need Vex. Vax, you're--
Liam: Well, I gotta go, I've got one success.
Matt: Right, but you're still unconscious, right?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: So, you just take-- you just lose a death saving throw. As the magma bursts and sprays around, so you take one. I need you to make a dexterity save. -I need Scanlan--
Sam: I lose another death save.
Matt: You lose another.
Laura: You got one left, Scanlan?
Matt: I need Pike to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Me too, right?
Matt: And you too, Grog.
Sam: He's got high dex, right? Right?
Laura: Well, this, you know what?
Matt: Gilmore does not make it.
Travis: That's not bad.
Matt: I'm rolling shit for damage, that's good. Wow.
Sam: What'd you roll, Laurs?
Laura: I rolled an eight for Pike.
Matt: Okay, so--
Laura: And a one for me.
Matt: Okay, ten points of fire damage to each of you halved, so you both take five.
Laura: Okay, I'm unconscious.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: This is so fun, you guys, I love this fight.
Sam: Let's go-- oh.
Laura: Pike's at 29.
Travis: I rolled a 19.
Matt: A 19, okay, you succeed, so you take half damage. So you take five, but you're resistant from the potion, so half that, so two. Two points of fire damage.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Alrighty. It is now Raishan's turn.
Marisha: So not good.
Travis: I just want to go flip the table over.
Matt: Hasted. Raishan, by the way, from the attack from Percy, the damage, you can see Raishan is now visibly bleeding. Parts of the scales are torn. You can see now, at a close up vantage point, as much as the previous dragons you've battled have had a lot of resilience, Raishan's taken a fair amount of damage, but seems to not be quite as physically hearty as what you previously faced and is looking visibly hurt. Raishan is going to begin the round, turning to the rest of you. "I have business elsewhere, and you're being really obnoxious. Stay down." And glancing over is going to go ahead and with both of her hands, again, release another... She is almost out of spells. Cone of Cold.
Laura: Oh no, this is gonna be Scanlan.
Marisha: Fuck.
Matt: That is-- I need-- -So, Scanlan--
Travis: No!
Matt: Scanlan is...
Taliesin: God fucking damn it.
Matt: Frozen, covered in ice, locked in place. A solid gnome bereft of life. Motionless on the ground.
Sam: I died as I lived  hard. (laughter)
Matt: Gilmore takes--
Travis: I heard him say that before he died.
Matt: Gilmore loses a death saving throw. Vax, you take another damage to your two failed death saving throws. Pike needs to make a constitution saving throw. Grog, constitution saving throw.
Laura: Was I in there?
Matt: You were, so you also--
Travis: Twenty-four.
Matt: Twenty-four, you succeed.
Travis: Plus 10 for constitution.
Laura: That's good.
Travis: Fourteen.
Marisha: Jesus.
Laura: Eleven for Pike.
Matt: Okay, that's 30 points of cold damage to Pike.
Laura: Seriously?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: She's unconscious.
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: Pike is unconscious.
Taliesin: That's where we're at.
Laura: We're-- we're-- I don't know how we're gonna get Scanlan back.
Taliesin: I--I have no-- there's no--
Marisha: That'll be a later question?
Taliesin: That may happen.
Matt: So Pike is down.
Taliesin: You have a plan?
Sam: I have a plan. It involves me humping a lot of angels in heaven.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Watching this carnage, you watch as the spell finalizes the blast of cold arcane energy just careening forth and then fading. The ground itself, which is now, normally glowing orange, is now covered with a very thin sheet of ice and you watch steam rise up from the contrasting heat and cold from the spell effecting the surrounding atmosphere. As the mist dissipates, you see a big toothy grin curl across Raishan's face. Little bit of dragon blood curling past her teeth from the wounds that she's suffered. Glaring nervously over at J'Mon Sa Ord, who has taken nearly no damage at this point and is currently up in Raishan's face. Raishan says, "Well, I'm afraid I have to get to the rest of my day. Die amongst your friends as you should." And just tears off of J'Mon and goes into a full hasted fly away.
Sam: Does J'Mon get--
Liam: Attack of opportunity, J'Mon.
Matt: J'Mon does, J'Mon is gonna make a bite attack against Raishan. With a natural 20!
Sam: Does that grapple?
Travis: Are you serious?
Marisha: Does that grapple?
Matt: It does not grapple. But that is...
Marisha: She'd have to do a concentration check, right?
Matt: She will, yeah. That is 18 plus eight. That's 26 piercing damage plus she's immune to poison. She takes no poison damage. That's 28 points of piercing damage to her.
Taliesin: (whimpering)
Matt: Concentration check, oh, she's fine. It's ten plus 14, so, yeah, she's fine. So, the haste does not dispel, however, J'Mon bites out and takes a huge chunk of flesh as the teeth just scrape across the back of Raishan's wing and shoulder like... (snarls) But manages to pull away and at a full 160 foot flying speed hasted and just disappears down the hallway.
Marisha: Should've done that, should've done it.
Matt: Into the ashes and shadow behind. Keyleth, it's your turn.
Marisha: Okay, she has 120 foot-- or she just went 160 feet?
Matt: A 160 feet, yeah. ♪
Marisha: Is she-- ♪ But she wasn't-- Fuck me, oh my God, okay. Can I still see her through the tunnel?
Matt: No, she is outside of your dark vision view radius and there is no light in the tunnel ahead and it is a slight incline. You just watch her just... Disappear into the dark tunnel. Currently have no bead of sight on her.
Travis: Smoke the tunnel, dude. Maybe you get her, maybe you don't. I'm gonna shut up.
Marisha: It's a range thing. I mean, could I try and-- fuck. -This is really bad.
Taliesin: Yes, it's really bad. ♪
Marisha: She's so far away, dude.
Sam: J'Mon can chase her.
Laura: But he's there and--
Taliesin: And she's so much faster than him. She's hasted.
Travis: Don't worry, I'm gonna take off at a run and--
Taliesin: Yeah. He can only go probably half her speed.
Travis: Picture Butterbean running down an empty street.
Marisha: 'Cause my-- my question is--
Sam: Jarret's still up there.
Marisha: She didn't necessarily--
Laura: Just waiting, crossbow loaded.
Travis: He's just like... (whimpers)
Marisha: 'Cause could I try and move up and then do a long range Wall of Stone spell? To try and collapse the tunnel before she gets out? It's 120 foot.
Matt: A 120 foot range? The spell from where you are currently, which is over here, she went 160 feet even further away from you than she was, so she'd be beyond the distance of the spell unfortunately.
Travis: Cause if you miss, you trap us.
Laura: Yeah, and then we can't get out.
Marisha: No, I mean, I can't-- I mean, I could get us out again, but--
Laura: A bunch of dead people, you could get a bunch of dead people out?
Marisha: I know. Okay, wow.
Travis: Indiana Jones and the Last crusade.
Marisha: This is really bad. Okay, I will use...
Laura: That wasn't her last spell, by the way. She's got three spell slots left.
Marisha: Who's-- yeah, who's really close? Who's like one away? Who's like really bad?
Laura: Close to death?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: He's closer to death than me.
Liam: I'm two failures.
Sam: Is Pike down?
Laura: Pike's unconscious.
Travis: Oh, she is?
Sam: Get Pike up.
Laura: I'm one fail, he's two fails. Scanlan's dead.
Taliesin: Who's got healing spells? Wake up whoever can heal.
Laura: I've got Cure Wounds if I'm awake.
Taliesin: So, get her up.
Liam: I can heal people if I get up.
Marisha: Okay, it doesn't matter. Can I kinda jump and make my way over like, this kind of...
Taliesin: Fuck.
Marisha: This-- can I cross this tinier lava right there? Kind of like, or is that a pretty far jump?
Matt: I mean, you have to still jump. So you have to make an athletics check.
Marisha: How far of a jump is that?
Matt: It's about six, seven feet. So make an athletics check.
Marisha: Sure, why not? Why not at this point?
Laura: No, Keyleth, no.
Marisha: Well, that was a natural one.
Travis: On what, on what?
Sam: Just moving.
Marisha: Just trying to jump across what should have been literally anything else.
Travis: How many hit points do you have? How many hit points do you have?
Sam: It doesn't matter, she's not even gonna get over to anyone to heal them.
Marisha: 60.
Laura: I don't know, man, lava.
Travis: One six or six zero.
Taliesin: Six zero.
Sam: She's fine. But no, she's not necessarily fine.
Laura: Lava has a new rule now.
Matt: Well, not a new rule, the actual rule.
Travis: The actual rule that we didn't use the very very first time. But we felt it last time.
Matt: So, as you rush over trying to help, you go to leap, but your foot catches what you thought was solid volcanic rock. Unfortunately, it's brittle and broken and it slips beneath your foot. In doing so, you only get about three feet before you plant the lower half of your body straight into the lava.
Laura: Oh my God.
Travis: (laughing)
Matt: That's 53 points of fire damage.
Laura: 53!
Sam: You're alive!
Laura: Get up, get out, you can get out of it. You've got seven points left.
Taliesin: You died as you lived.
Marisha: A fucking dumbass, yeah!
Travis: I can't see! It's just a wall of tears.
Laura: Can she get out of the lava or is she just in?
Marisha: Can I get out now? I'm trying to use my movement or am I gonna die if I get out?
Matt: You're essentially prone in the lava. You rolled a one to jump and you basically went...
Laura: Belly flopped into lava.
Laura: You mean, she's gonna take damage trying to get out of it?
Marisha: Can I get out?
Matt: You're technically prone. The rest of your movement will get you up and out, but it'll just get you out of the lava.
Laura: At least you're out.
Liam: Get out, get out.
Matt: So, you'll get out and you'll be just on the edge there.
Laura: Oh my God.
Travis: This is the best.
Laura: This is the worst!
Matt: Wow!
Marisha: I was like, as long as I don't roll a one, that shouldn't be that hard-- okay.
Taliesin: Oh, look, someone left a metaphor on the ground. (laughter) Don't step in it or anything. Oh God, it's everywhere.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Wow.
Taliesin: Well, this could've gone worse.
Matt: Wow!
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Okay, I'm out of the flame.
Matt: This whole thing's a metaphor for 2017.
Laura: Does J'Mon Sa Ord have any healing spells?
Marisha: And I reach over as a bonus action and do a Healing Word to-- to Vax.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Just--
Matt: What level?
Marisha: I don't know.
Travis: Come on, stay with it. -Stay in the fight.
Marisha: Level one. Oh, that's good, that's four so, nine points.
Sam: Nine points.
Travis: He wakes up!
Matt: Vax is now conscious.
Marisha: No, I'm sorry ten points, that's ten points.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: Sweet, even better. You're double digits. Scanlan, we've got to just-- we've got to get Scanlan back.
Taliesin: There's a lot of work that needs to happen.
Travis: I got her, I got-- I got Pike.
Taliesin: Who's up?
Sam: Grog is up.
Taliesin: I mean, who's next?
Travis: I think it's me.
Laura: It's Gilmore.
Travis: No, it's Gilmore.
Matt: So, Gilmore gets up. Kind of looks around. "Where did she go?"
Travis: "Through the tunnel."
Matt: Okay. He rushes this way and as he gets about there, he... slams into something that is currently invisible. You see a slight ripple of arcane energy and you see a series of small glyphs spiral outward and then it goes see-through again. He starts slamming his fists on it. "Of course, of course. Of course."
Travis: No.
Matt: He goes and... Let's see what he has left.
Travis: She made a Lite Brite wall.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: He's a mime.
Matt: Technically, he looks like a mime from your standpoint.
Marisha: Can I turn to J'Mon? Say, "J'Mon, can you sense her presence? She's a fellow dragon. Do you know where she might be going or what she might be doing?"
Matt: "I haven't the faintest. I only just arrived."
Travis: Oh, fuck, Thordak is outside of the cave!
Liam: Are we out of combat now?
Travis: Thordak is still in the hallway.
Laura: The round's still going.
Matt: So we're gonna continue going through the order here.
Laura: So, it's Grog, it's your turn, Grog.
Matt: So, Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: I run to my buddy, Pike, and I beer bong this Greater healing potion into her gullet.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: What is that?
Laura: 4d8 plus four. I mean, 4d4 plus four.
Matt: 4d4 plus four.
Travis: Eight. Twelve. -Twelve points.
Laura: So, Pike is awake.
Travis: "Hi, hi!" -"Go, heal!"
Laura: "What's going--"
Travis: "Lot of problems."
Sam: Got any more of those Revivify's?
Matt: Alright, that ends your turn, Grog?
Laura: Actually, she does have a third level spell left.
Matt: You do.
Marisha: Really?
Laura: Yes!
Laura: She does have a third level spell!
Marisha: Well, yes, do that, do that really quick!
Laura: She cast Revivify at fourth level the last time.
Marisha: Do it, do it, do it.
Travis: The eggs that remain are toast?
Laura: Holy shit.
Matt: Two of them are completely destroyed and there is one that has been shot and is leaking.
Laura: I have it circled.
Taliesin: Don't worry about it. Let's get out there.
Travis: Alright, that ends my turn.
Matt: Okay. That brings us to Vex. I need you to make a death saving throw.
Laura: Right. I'm scared of all these dice.
Travis: I'm using what's left of my movement to go towards that egg.
Matt: Towards this egg?
Travis: Yeah, the one shot egg.
Matt: Okay. ♪
Taliesin: I'm gonna try something weird.
Matt: That's two death saving throws on Vex.
Travis: You failed it?
Laura: I failed it.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: I stumble over to my sister and cast Lay on Hands and give her five to bring her back.
Matt: So, yeah, cause you've been giving it out--
Liam: I haven't done anything with Lay on Hands. Or I might have done it once but I always do very small amounts. I have a total of 15 hit points cause I'm a third level--
Matt: I'm pretty sure you used it once before.
Liam: But I've never used more than five with that spell cause it's worthless to heal. It's just good for bringing up. So I have at least 10 hit points left.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Five hit points.
Laura: Yeah, cause the only time you used it before was when you BAMFed up to my broom after I grabbed the dagger.
Matt: You're still prone by the way. You just basically crawled over and touched her.
Liam: That's fine. I'm gonna use the rest of my movement to stand.
Matt: Okay, so you stand up and you still have half your movement if you wanted to.
Liam: Everyone who's down, who's down? And I don't mean dead. -Pike just got--
Taliesin: Pike's up.
Matt: Pike is conscious, your sister's conscious.
Liam: Is Kima conscious?
Laura: Yes. Kima's conscious.
Liam: So, we've got dead Scanlan.
Taliesin: And that's-- that's Pike's problem.
Liam: And that's it, I'm done. Wait, where's that egg?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: It doesn't matter.
Laura: It's the last egg.
Liam: I'm done, I'm done.
Matt: Alrighty, that ends Vax's turn.
Laura: Just worried there's gonna be another lair action in the same spot.
Matt: Kima rushes up and swinging her holy sword in the air, goes for a full swing, noticing that everybody's now conscious, goes and takes a full swing towards this invisible barrier. As it streaks across, you see divine energy go flying off in a shower of sparks and a giant shimmering, shaking visual on this-- this force wall that stands here in the center of the hallway. As she finishes her attack, it shimmers unscathed. She goes for a secondary attack. Strikes again. This time as it strikes across the sparks are even brighter and you can see the impact almost pushing her back off of her feet and as the blade comes to the end of its second arc. She looks up. The wall still stands.
Travis: You are shitting me. It doesn't flicker, doesn't--
Laura: It needs like a dispel or something.
Marisha: Oh my God, I could-- Oh my God, I could!
Taliesin: Alright, that's an option.
Matt: Alrighty that brings us to...
Matt: J'Mon. J'Mon rushes. Flies up to the edge and kind of takes a moment streak a few claws across it. And where the claws streak, you can see the shimmering of this force wall.
Travis: Well, phone's out, oh God.
Matt: "The phone's out, oh God"?
Sam: He's calling an Uber because he knows we're gonna kill him after this is done.
Matt: Come on, four percent, I got four percent left.
Sam: Four percent, get this man a charger!
Matt: I know.
Sam: Taliesin!
Liam: No, no, no. Let's start a YouTube video on it.
Sam: Can you run this over to Matt?
Matt: Yeah. J'Mon, with each strike, is like testing the boundaries of it across the sides of the tunnel and just goes... "This magic holds."
Travis: What? It holds? "It--it holds?"
Matt: Fun charger.
Taliesin: Let me know, I've got maybe a plan. Yeah, you've got that. That's an option, I've got another plan. You know my plan, my plan kind of sucks, but.
Matt: I'm not getting a charge.
Sam: Give it somebody else. There's a button.
Matt: That's alright. It happens. Anyway.
Taliesin: No, no, it should just start.
Sam: No, there's a button.
Taliesin: Oh, there is a button.
Sam: There's a button, he'll find it.
Matt: J'Mon, oh, J'Mon gets the breath weapon back. And kind of pushes... both Kima and Gilmore aside. "Excuse me." And unleashes a blast of burning hot breath across this wall. As it hits, it just curls across and spreads across the side of the walls as the dragon shields both Kima and Gilmore from the blast. As it finishes, the flame has been split the entirety and has no effect on the wall.
Travis: Holy shit.
Laura: I wonder-- I wonder if the beehive thing above us, that the holes are covered in magic as well.
Travis: Are you conscious?
Laura: Am I-- I am conscious.
Taliesin: I say, well, maybe killing the eggs, I don't know. Kill the eggs.
Matt: Pike.
Travis: Or maybe it's like a Pacific Rim--
Laura: But I don't know what that says.
Sam: I--I can give it to you.
Laura: But it's now. My question is, Pike runs up, thank you. Oh, oh! If she runs up, is she gonna be able to get her hand on-- on Scanlan?
Matt: Well, she was-- She was prone, right? She just came back to consciousness. So she gets up for half her movement.
Taliesin: We got a minute. Got a minute.
Travis: I would have picked her up after the last time. I was being pissed about-- I mean, you know, she's so tiny.
Matt: Being a gnome, it's one of those things where 25 feet halved and you always round on the lower end of the scale. At ten feet, she's not close enough to touch Scanlan. Yet.
Marisha: Even with the Sprinter's Boots?
Matt: Sprinter's Boots already got used. It's got one round use.
Laura: She says "She can use the Sprinter's Boots twice" in all caps.
Matt: Alright then.
Taliesin: The caps are what make it worthwhile.
Matt: I'll trust her.
Travis: She's on a 30 second delay so she wrote that before we said it.
Laura: Actually she did write that before we said it.
Matt: Good, alright then. Then that will be just enough to put her up next to Scanlan.
Laura: Okay. So, Pike puts her hands on either side of his face and says, "Scanlan. Your letter to me was wonderful and I want to do what you asked but I can't raise Kaylee alone, I need you to come back." And she casts Revivify on him.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20.
Laura: I'm so scared. Thirteen?
Matt: Thirteen, okay. As she implores to the spirit of Scanlan in this frozen form, you watch as the icy crystals that have coalesced around his form and locked him in his place, his face kind of-- This frozen look of horror. The ice begins to turn into mist around him and his color begins to return to his skin. His expression relaxes as his eyes suddenly focus and Scanlan, you find yourself conscious again looking up at Pike. Tears in her eyes, pulling her hand back from your shoulder. Looking up into the dark, you know, glowing lit interior of Thordak's lair.
Sam: Don't cry. I'm just a little cold.
Laura: "Warm up. Does anybody have a blanket?"
Sam: "Just hold me."
Laura: "Okay."
Travis: She sent a picture.
Laura: She did. She sent a picture of the Sprinter's Boots cards with two uses.
Travis: "Used twice while in rest..."
Matt: There we go. Cool, that's what I wanted, thank you. So make sure everyone has their equipment cards on them. Alright, so that finishes Pike's turn. Scanlan, you're conscious now.
Sam: Hi.
Travis: Welcome back, we're still fucked by the way.
Sam: What's going on?
Travis: They sealed us in here with a giant magic screen across this door. Dragon's breath does nothing, Kima does nothing. You know anything about this? Any limericks for magic cave doors?
Sam: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Laura: Glad you're back, Scanlan.
Sam: Thanks, thanks. I've got one thing up my sleeve. It's a dog that can run around and help us. That's about it.
Laura: Are we gonna have to take a short rest?
Taliesin: No.
Sam: I don't know, I don't know. What-- there's magic there? I can't do anything about that.
Laura: Can I-- can I-- I know I'm gonna-- Can I broom up to the holes? God, I'm so scared to get on this broom again.
Taliesin: Well, it's not-- we're still--
Laura: Oh, in our order?
Marisha: We're still going in order?
Marisha: Do you still have a Mansion?
Matt: Well, right now, as we're getting back into this. Percy, what are you doing?
Marisha: I have a crazy plan.
Laura: Did you let the dog out?
Sam: No, I don't know what--
Travis: Who let the dog out?
Laura: Scanlan, did you let the dog out?
Sam: Keyleth, do you have a crazy plan?
Marisha: You only have to cast the Mansion Door within line of sight, correct?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I don't know that that's true actually. Three hundred feet, 300 feet range.
Laura: Do you have it left?
Sam: I do.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay, two things. One, before we start burning our seventh level spells, I still have Stone Shape. Can Keyleth go up to the wall and do I have enough-- is there just enough room in the corridor walls that I could Stone Shape--
Sam: I could Dimension Door out of here.
Laura: Why would you just--
Liam: You get a tunnel for all of us, mate.
Sam: Yeah, that would just be me.
Marisha: Can I Stone Shape a tunnel kind of around the thing? Or is--
Matt: First things first, Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion is a one minute casting time.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So you could do it, but in the process of doing so, you'd probably go through about 10 different lair actions in here.
Taliesin: Yeah, there's that.
Matt: So, Keyleth, you're using, you said, stone--
Marisha: Can I Stone Shape a little passage around? Do I have just enough kinda to where I can-- where the barrier is I can kind of carve a little corridor around?
Liam: Around or under?
Matt: It would be very tiny and you'd have to crawl through to create enough-- Cause you're not quite sure how thick the barrier is, so you have to be-- have to roll an investigation check and based on your roll, I'll let you know.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: This is a plan.
Marisha: Eight.
Matt: Eight? You're not sure, you can give it a shot.
Marisha: I'm-- might as well give it a shot, I mean--
Matt: Before it gets to you, it does come back to a lair action.
Laura: Wait, but--
Sam: On my turn, I drank a potion.
Matt: Okay, so take your healing.
Sam: That's it.
Taliesin: Has my turn not come up yet?
Laura: I hate that we can't get out of this fucking area!
Matt: Sorry, I asked you what you were doing.
Taliesin: Oh, I want to try something stupid.
Matt: What do you want to try?
Taliesin: I want to try and run headlong at the barrier.
Matt: Okay. Well, you have to--
Laura: Don't get too close into this area, Percy, cause this is where the fucking lair action keeps coming up.
Taliesin: I want to stay on the wall.
Matt: Stay on the wall, okay. Leaving you roughly there. So even a full turn, that's as far as you could get on a double run.
Taliesin: Yeah, and I'm up on the wall still.
Matt: Cool. Alright, now-- now this happens. With this, the quakiness of the lair seems to be subsiding a little bit. There is a tremor on the ground. It only effects those directly around the barrier, so that's my people. Everyone succeeds, so no one falls prone. So no effect on that lair action, per se. Alright, past that. You can see in the distance, past the wall, dark in the tunnel, which is almost pitch black beyond the radius, you see this slight purplish glow and then a flash of purple energy.
Taliesin: God, fucking damn it!
Marisha: Talking to Thordak!
Sam: Should I go?
Laura: What are you gonna do?
Sam: Distract it, do something.
Travis: You're gonna be all by yourself.
Marisha: Okay, I'm gonna Stone Shape and try and just cast a little, even if it's a corridor just right around.
Matt: It's a touch spell so you have to get up to it, so you're back there. So you just get up to the edge of the doorway and the wall with a double run.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Okay?
Marisha: I'm go ahead and can I use a bonus action.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I'm gonna use my-- no, no, no, I'm gonna just drink a healing potion real quick. Just one of my Greaters.
Matt: Okay, go for it. So it is 4d4 plus four. Alright. Gilmore.
Taliesin: This poor book has seen better days.
Matt: Gilmore doesn't really have anything that can be of aid right now.
Matt: Gilmore moves over towards you. Preparing for what you're up to, and just kind of puts his hand on your shoulder, Keyleth, and goes, "Whatever you're doing, I'm right behind you. Don't worry."
Taliesin: Hold you up so you don't fall.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Marisha: I'm not feeling very confident right now.
Travis: You look like you're up to something, do you have a plan?
Marisha: I'm trying to Stone Shape a corridor through this, but I don't know if it's going to be enough to get through the thickness.
Travis: Right, as a backup plan...
Travis: How big is J'Mon Sa Ord? Like a big dragon or just like eh?
Matt: About the same size as Raishan.
Travis: So, we couldn't like all Falcor on J'Mon up to the spider network of tunnels in the ceiling, right? Like we couldn't ride him.
Matt: Raishan and J'Mon have a very similar physicality. Like their bodies can, much like a cat can get really thin, just enough to fit through the tunnels, maybe, but not with any riders. You guys would probably be squeezed off or crushed in the process.
Travis: Could she get us up there and then follow us up through the tunnels if we--
Taliesin: We don't know where they go.
Travis: It's better than this place. They're exhaust tunnels.
Taliesin: That's fair, although I will say, before we leave, we should probably make sure all those eggs are down -before we leave anyway.
Travis: That's my idea. And then, I'm gonna end my turn.
Laura: Are you gonna run and hit an egg?
Travis: Oh, yeah!
Laura: There's an egg left over there.
Taliesin: Hit an egg.
Travis: Shamone! Yeah, I'll just run towards egg. Ooh! I'm gonna use all three of my attacks on that egg.
Matt: Go for it. Go for it.
Marisha: Egg doesn't know what's coming.
Travis: That's a-- that's a 33.
Matt: That'll hit.
Travis: Oh, minus five. Okay. That's a 31, no, 39.
Matt: Okay, so the first strike just cleaves through the egg entirely.
Travis: Oh.
Matt: I know. You impact at the point of the bullet that Percy left earlier, which kind of left that spider web crack in the front and that just causes the entire thing to buckle under the sheer force of your axe as it swings. The egg gets cut in half, tumbles over, splattering primordial dragon whelp gore and you can see the remnants inside of what is now a two-parter primordial dragon whelp.
Laura: Did it look like Thordak?
Travis: Did any dragon parts spill out of the egg?
Matt: Yeah, as it flew off and kind--
Travis: Could I grab a piece of it, take a step back and try and like throw it towards the wall to see if it bounces off as well? Just in case it's like a, you know, lair barcode?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Hey, we got through!
Marisha: They got the key card.
Taliesin: Multi-pass.
Matt: As you pull it up, and this creature is, nearly identical to the one that you pulled out earlier. It's still deep red crimson, but like fully, fully primordial in its visual. You take back a chunk of it and you throw it at the wall and it just passes through. (gasps)
Sam: What just happened?
Marisha: Shut up!
Laura: You were right!
Sam: What did he just do?
Taliesin: You solved it!
Sam: How, what did he do?
Liam: Destroying the last egg.
Sam: Fucking guy!
Laura: Or by--
Marisha: Or by-- it's like he said. We cover ourselves in dragon goo and then we can walk through.
Taliesin: One of the two.
Travis: Residual goo in my hand, I just like rub it all on my face.
Matt: It smells terrible.
Taliesin: You can hop in the egg. It's basically a hot tub.
Marisha: We didn't destroy all the eggs, right?
Matt: Currently, you destroyed three of them and two were lightning baked and taken off by Raishan.
Sam: My voice is my passport.
Marisha: So, do it. It's hard to say.
Taliesin: I love that movie.
Laura: Maybe we should hold onto a piece and try to pass through it.
Taliesin: Hello.
Matt: Well, that finishes Grog's turn. Vex?
Laura: That's me. I used a level-- did I use a level four spell already? Shit.
Matt: I'm pretty sure you guys went down guns blazing.
Taliesin: Somewhere in the world, there's a whole chatroom of people yelling at you telling you--
Laura: Oh, that's right, I did. I did use it cause I was--
Marisha: Yeah, I was gonna say, "somewhere"?
Laura: So I have a level three left. Who needs healing? Me and Pike and everybody.
Taliesin: There's always-- everybody needs healing.
Marisha: Me.
Laura: You do.
Sam: I got single dig going on.
Laura: So do I, I got five.
Travis: Single dig.
Laura: I got five points, how many you got?
Sam: I got eight or nine, I can't remember my math. It's pretty bad. Wait, if I had one, plus eight would be nine.
Laura: So you have nine points. I'm gonna take a healing potion. I mean, I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on myself.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, yeah, you do your thing.
Matt: 3d8 plus whatever your modifier is, go for it.
Taliesin: It's all good.
Marisha: Kind of.
Taliesin: No, it's not, I know, but like, it's looking better.
Marisha: Well, we're not all dead. We just can't die anymore.
Taliesin: And worst case scenario, we're stuck in here for another round.
Laura: So, 20 points.
Matt: Twenty points, okay.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: And you didn't even burn a spell yet.
Laura: Can I run over and get some dragon guts on my hand and then to try to put my hand through the thingy?
Matt: With your speed and getting up, cause you were prone.
Laura: Please let me out of this spot.
Matt: That close right there. You can't quite get to the dragon guts. That's as far as you can get.
Taliesin: It may just be that it's down now, but it may be the dragon guts.
Matt: Alright, so that ends Vex's turn, Vax. Whatcha doing?
Liam: I'm just gonna move towards the gate. Put my hand out and see if I can go through or if I get stopped.
Matt: You walk right through.
Taliesin: Alright!
Laura: Oh!
Marisha: It's the eggs, it was the eggs.
Liam: Alright, everybody! Quietly.
Marisha: Hang on, hang on. I'm feeling very guilty because it was my rage and anger and want for vengeance which made me run in here blindly towards her, maybe we shouldn't do it again is all I'm saying.
Taliesin: No, too late. Got to finish this off.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Does your guilt have a Mass Cure Wounds? In that case, doesn't matter.
Matt: "Forward, now!" And all of you just start...
Marisha: Avengers Run down the hall.
Matt: Like crawling over all of you.
Taliesin: Avengers, it's clobbering time.
Sam: I--I grab Kima and I say, "Get ready to hit a dragon," and I'm gonna Dimension Door me and Kima to Thordak's body.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, geez.
Matt: Kima goes, "Wait, what?" As soon as you grab the shoulder and you both suddenly vanish and reappear at Thordak's body. You both land with a flash of arcane light. As your feet hit the ground, it is an empty tunnel. So, no Raishan. -There is no Thordak corpse.
Laura: Fuck.
Sam: There's no Thordak's corpse?
Marisha: There's no Thordak's corpse?
Matt: Correct.
Laura: Fuck! Fuck.
Liam: She just wanted to talk to it.
Taliesin: She may have taken him somewhere.
Travis: Talk to it, my ass. She didn't want to talk to it.
Marisha: Or she raised him. Jesus.
Liam: One last roll in the hay.
Matt: As you guys approach, Gilmore steps up and goes, "I think I have a pretty good idea what that flash we saw was."
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: Teleport.
Matt: "Getting the hell out of here. Son of a bitch!" He takes a rock and throws it. Hair's kind of tussled.
Marisha: Vex, can you sense dragons anywhere nearby?
Laura: Can I sense anyone but J'Mon Sa Ord as far as dragons go nearby? I drop down to my knees and concentrate.
Matt: No.
Laura: Nothing! Nothing. She's nowhere. Fuck.
Matt: And that's where we'll end tonight's episode. (all groaning) We have a flight early in the morning.
Travis: Oh!
Laura: I can't believe that we all came back.
Taliesin: I can't believe we all lived.
Matt: I can't believe you all lived.
Taliesin: That should not have happened.
Marisha: That was really scary.
Laura: It was just giant clusterfuck from like halfway through with just everybody falling down and trying to get back up.
Matt: Well, if-- If you had fallen into the lava, by the way, if you had rolled poorly, you would have been submerged in lava, which was...
Laura: Unconscious.
Matt: Well, that-- that's 18d10 points of damage. If that had exceeded your max hit points, you would have been instantly dead and turned to ash.
Liam: Been nice if I'd cut out her tongue.
Laura: So, gone, gone-gone.
Matt: Yeah. There were a few close calls there.
Travis: She was like three. I think there were like nine.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: And then if you hadn't counter spelled the color...
Matt: Oh, yeah, the Prismatic Spray. That would have been real bad.
Sam: Who was she shooting against?
Taliesin: Everybody.
Marisha: It's a spray.
Matt: It's a cone that big.
Taliesin: So it would have been almost everybody.
Matt: Just so you guys know, cause it's a fun spell to kind of talk about.
Taliesin: It is.
Matt: And each of you would have been hit with a different colored ray. I would have rolled a d8 to see what color had hit you. On a one, you take 10d6 fire damage. On a failed save, half. An orange, take 10d6 acid damage, save for half. Yellow: 10d6 lightning damage. So, just randomly all of you guys basically just take 10d6 of something. Green: you take 10d6 poison damage, half save. Five, 10d6 cold damage. Six, on a failed save, you're restrained and you have to keep making saves or you turn to stone. Seven, you're blinded and you have to keep saving. A successful save ends it, if you fail the next save, you will be transported to another plane.
Laura: What?!
Sam: There's one where you get to do two things.
Matt: On an eight, on an eight, I roll again for two rays against that person.
Laura: Oh my God!
Travis: For two rays?
Sam: What if you keep rolling eights?
Matt: Keep rolling eights, you're gonna be fucked. It's a fun one. I like that spell.
Laura: Wait, what is a 10? Is 10 insta-death, what is 10?
Matt: It's one d8, so ten would be instant death, it would be. If I roll a 10 on a d8, sure. You are so done.
Taliesin: The other plane of dimension is like literally the Beetlejuice, like send you to the sandworms. You're just--
Matt: Oops.
Taliesin: And that's-- you're out of the fight until they can go find you if anyone's left. After everyone else has taken 10d-- suck.
Matt: So, guys, we'll pick this up again next week on Thursday. Find out where Raishan is.
Travis: Maybe.
Matt: With two eggs and the corpse of Thordak, The Cinder King.
Laura: Well, hopefully, oh my God.
Taliesin: Red eggs and ham?
Travis: Yeah, she just escaped with two Iphone 7's.
Matt: You start with a disadvantage.
Taliesin: I just want the internet to do a Dr. Seuss red eggs and-- I just want her with like a little red steak and two little red-- That's all I want.
Matt: Alright, guys. You guys, we'll see you at MAGFest this weekend. We'll see you there shortly.
Sam: Remember, bring your magazines and have Matt and Marisha sign any magazine.
Taliesin: Highlights.
Marisha: Yeah, all magazines. We will sign them.
Liam: I mean, you're gonna say, you don't know, but if J'Mon had not nurked those three attacks that round, might she have gone down?
Matt: She came pretty close.
Laura: Oh, yeah, if J'Mon had not gotten three, two, one.
Matt: Three, two and a one.
Marisha: That sucked.
Matt: That really sucked.
Marisha: I was about to lay some serious damage when she ran away. I was gonna bust out a seventh level blight and then she ran.
Matt: I wasn't getting-- cause that the fire breath is nasty.
Marisha: Yeah, and he didn't fucking recharge it.
Travis: If your highness wasn't smart enough to break another egg...
Laura: I got to attack one time that round. Every other round was just trying not to die.
Liam: He should have stretched before the fight.
Matt: But anyway.
Marisha: Happy New Year.
Matt: Happy New Year! Well done, guys, you survived.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yay.
Matt: Mostly. Thank you so much for our sponsor tonight, nobody. 2017. You guys are our sponsors. Well, every week you are. So thank you for all your wonderful support. Happy New Year, welcome to the chaos of 2017. We're there alongside you for it. We'll see you guys soon and... Is it Thursday yet? Have a good night. ♪

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors and awesome writing guest play Dungeons and Dragons. Before we get into the chaos for tonight's episode, let's go ahead and knock through our announcements. First and foremost, tonight's episode is brought to you by Magic Puzzle Quest. (all cheer)
Sam: Marvel Puzzle Quest!
Matt: It was written "Magic" on here. Marvel Puzzle Quest.
Sam: Mazel tov Puzzle Quest.
Matt: Yay! Marvel Puzzle Quest, our sponsor for tonight. Sam, you had a few words?
Sam: Marvel Puzzle Quest is available now on Apple and Android devices. The latest update adds Riri Williams, a.k.a. Ironheart. You can check it out at bit.ly/criticalmpq-- that'll be posted all over the place, but I got a chance to play this game, and let me just tell you, I'm a pretty good gamer. I just loved being able to play this game through. I tried it on a PS4, I tried it on a PS3, I tried it on Xbox 360, because I'm a 1337 gamer. I tried it on Steam Engine, because that's how you get games, and it was amazing. You can play as all your favorite Marvel characters, like the Avengers. The Avengers include characters like Elrond Man, Nick Furry, Red White and Blue Shield Guy, the Hulch, and there's other characters like Lord Star, Dice Man, Carnage, Aunt Man, Professor Triple X, and the Medical Team; that's what I call these characters called Dr. Doom, Dr. Strange, and Dr. Octopus; they're all medical doctors and they all fight for good. There's Kamala Chaka Khan, there's Juggs or Not-- (all laugh)
Sam: You can play as the Human Porch, he just relaxes. Nic Cage. One of my favorite X-Men is Jennifer Grey, from Dirty Dancing. There's Rocket and Poot and everybody's favorite Canadian tough-guy, Walford Rains. Snicket! Yeah. And you solve puzzles and it's really addictive.
Matt: Thank you, Sam.
Travis: Oh my god. Jugs or Not.
Marisha: We're like the only show that a sponsor's going to let us get away with botching their product.
Sam: That's the names! You haven't played like I have. That's the names of the characters, I'm pretty sure.
Patrick rothfuss: I love the team of Professor Triple X and Dr. Strange.
Sam: They all have PhDs. It makes sense.
Taliesin: They're pronounced Centennials, actually.
Marisha: I don't like millennials. I'm a Centennial.
Matt: Thank you very much, not Magic, but Marvel Puzzle Quest, for being our awesome sponsor tonight. Check out their stuff. All right, also, Marisha, do you want to talk a bit about the promo code?
Marisha: If you watched Talks Machina this week on Tuesday night, you saw that we gave away a promo code, hashtag-- no, no hashtags. It's just a code. Just the code "TALKS." Like if you're talking, like I'm doing right now. "TALKS" as in Talks Machina, and that gives you 30 days free trial on Alpha, so if you're a good gamer like Sam is--
Sam: I'm 1337.
Marisha: You know that those things stack, so you can use your free subscription from Amazon Prime, and then use another 30 days, and then it's only 30 more days before your checks expire and then they're not good anymore.
Sam: Is this like a Columbia House thing where you keep doing a new subscription?
Liam: You're dating us.
Taliesin: I think our audience gets the joke. The camera's laughing.
Marisha: Anyway, yes. Promo code "TALKS."
Patrick rothfuss: Columbia House is where the X-Men used to live. Before it was the mansion, it was Columbia House.
Marisha: Oh! You should also go watch Talks Machina, too.
Matt: It's our crazy little aftershow. We have silly discussions, answer community questions, and generally just hang out and make fools of ourselves for your entertainment.
Marisha: It's good fun.
Laura: Along with Brian W. Foster!
Matt: Laura, Travis, me, and Marisha once again will be guests at Anime Milwaukee next month. We'll be up there Friday through Sunday doing panels, signings, all kinds of chaos. Come see us, come say hi. Bring things we'll sign them. Bring questions and we'll answer them. Bring handshakes and we'll touch them.
Laura: What are those dates again?
Travis: February 17th through the 19th.
Matt: February 17th through the 19th. Yes.
Travis: Or whatever the dates say.
Matt: Sorry, I'm going off what I have. And merchandise, Laura.
Laura: Hey, guess what?
Matt: What?
Travis: What?
Laura: There's some merchandise! (all cheer)
Liam: Can you buy it?
Laura: You can buy it in the shop on Geek and Sundry. There's nothing new this week, but there's all the stuff that I talked about last week, like socks and hoodies and hats and bracelets and pens--
Sam: Wait, we have socks now?
Laura: Oh, you missed it!
Sam: Socks Machina?
Laura: Socks Machina!
Marisha: So we have Critical Role socks, which apparently they've done really good, we've already sold half, and people are already super excited for us to have character-driven socks.
Taliesin: They're really comfy, but then I took them off and my cats found them and now they will not give them back.
Matt: Don't give them to your cats.
Taliesin: No, this is really true, they've taken them and they're not giving them back.
Matt: For context, Socks Machina was a joke of ours over a year ago, and now it's happening.
Sam: It sounds pretty stupid.
Travis: They're really nice, man.
Marisha: We came up with Socks Machina at the same time that we came up with Lox Machina, which is our branded smoked salmon.
Laura: That's someday soon, guys. I'm hoping for that in the store.
Travis: There'll be Grog socks with just tons of holes in them.
Matt: Perfect.
Travis: Made by me.
Laura: Gross, really stinky. No, they should look like barbarian boots, fur-lined boots since you're--
Travis: Not as cool.
Marisha: Oh, with little fur on top?
Travis: They're going to smell like balsamic vinaigrette or something.
Sam: Can mine have garter belts?
Laura: If you want.
Sam: Thank you.
Matt: All righty. And last but not least, we have International Tabletop Day coming up April 29th, where we here are going to be celebrating everything tabletop. We'll have more announcements as the week gets closer and closer to it, but we're excited for it. A bunch of us, if not all of us, are going to be involved in some way or another, and just keep an eye out for announcements as they roll out. So mark it on your calendar. April 29th.
Travis: April 29th.
Matt: I think that's it, if anyone has anything else they want to announce?
Liam: Oh, I got a quick one. Taliesin and I were playing Ubisoft's game For Honor this morning for Nerdist and Geek and Sundry.
Taliesin: And it was fun!
Liam: It was fun.
Taliesin: It was nuts.
Liam: There'll be more of it tomorrow. We got a couple of warriors in there. I'm playing the knight. The chivalrous knight in that game.
Travis: I play a viking.
Taliesin: No, it's good fun. I'm back in tomorrow morning. Actually, you can see me tomorrow morning at 9AM Pacific Time.
Liam: You got a major renfaire boner playing that game today.
Taliesin: It's hot. It's pretty hot. It's great. I want to collect all the things and basically use it as a play on the little Renaissance-era barbie doll. And just paint him and put things on and change armors.
Travis: Okay, all right, okay. Jeez.
Matt: PVP Renfaire adventure. For Honor. That's awesome, cool. Anything else? All right. Then let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [INTRO]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. So, picking up where we left off from my esteemed panel of extremely mature--
Travis: No one can hear it, man. It doesn't exist.
Sam: (singing) In the morning.
Matt: Anyway. Bringing us into tonight's episode, leading up to where we are currently in the story: Vox Machina, having spent a period of time battling with the Chroma Conclave, a collection of evil and allied chromatic dragons that terrorized the Tal'Dorei countryside, have acquired artifacts called the Vestiges of Divergence. After traversing the planes and locations to gather allies, they made war on the current occupying armies of Thordak the Cinder King in the center of the capital city of Emon, managed to eke out a victory, destroying Thordak, and apparently go into battle with a dragon they'd made an alliance with, known as Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, a member of the Conclave with which they had a very tenuous agreement to work together. After being nearly killed by Raishan as she flew the coop, essentially, you managed to collect the remaining armies of the city, made sure everyone was okay. You ran into an old friend from Westruun, Kerrek, who had brought a number of his able-bodied warriors with him to aid in this battle. You then made your way to Whitestone with Kerrek to ascertain the location of Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, of which apparently she had absconded to what's called the island of Viskon. It used to belong to a necromancer and then briefly became the lair of Thordak the Cinder King before his original attack on Tal'Dorei roughly 16 years ago. You then gathered your weapons, your armor, and your reserve strength, and with a couple of allies traversed through teleportation all the way to this island, managed to battle your way through a deep dungeon that once this necromancer called home, going past traps and chasms filled with undead, and gravity reversed through magical means. You made your way into a small tunnel just past this area into what seemed to split into two sides. Behind that, what appeared to be the necromancer's sanctum, some sort of necrotic laboratory, where you discovered there within two of the eggs of Thordak's lair that were taken by Raishan, the corpse of Thordak, folded in the corner, and apparently Raishan's female human form, currently poring through books and rummaging through what currently appears to be the relatively untouched necropolis chamber. So, last we left off, the two twins had snuck ahead to take a look and take in the information of this vicinity, while the rest of the party began to slowly approach from behind. As the rest of the party is coming behind, I would like everybody else to make a stealth check, please.
Marisha: Do we have Pass Without a Trace?
Laura: Yes. No.
Matt: I don't believe you cast it. Did you?
Taliesin: Ages ago.
Liam: Yeah, ages ago. I just don't know how long it lasts.
Travis: Yeah, it's been a while.
Matt: You've lost concentration since then.
Laura: Yeah, I don't think I've cast it since we came out the other side.
Liam: Flying up on the broom, all that.
Laura: Natural 20 for Pike!
Travis: That's a good thing.
Matt: Great. She has disadvantage because of her armor. Roll again. Well, no, she put on the elven boots, didn't she?
Laura: No, Kima did.
Matt: That's right. So yeah, roll again.
Liam: Just roll another 20.
Travis: Just do it again. Here we go. Hi! Hey!
Marisha: We've done it before and we can do it again.
Travis: Not as great.
Liam: Never mind.
Travis: What is it?
Laura: Four?
Matt: Four.
Travis: Plus? Plus?
Laura: Nothing.
Travis: Cool. 13.
Taliesin: Eight with a natural one.
Marisha: Ten total.
Sam: Not good.
Travis: Let's be honest, she fucking knows we're here.
Patrick rothfuss: This was my one 20 of the night, folks, everyone else--
Laura: Failed you.
Marisha: It just means you won't die first.
Taliesin: She doesn't know you're here.
Laura: Yeah, you're invisible. You have an invisibility ring.
Patrick rothfuss: I put on the ring and I just leave. (all laugh)
Patrick rothfuss: Just gone.
Matt: One step.
Taliesin: And that's how Bilbo's insurance company started. Just going home. We can start again with a real job. I'm done.
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30?
Laura: Wait, the twins are rolling too? I should've taken that 20 for myself, then.
Liam: Yeah, I thought you did.
Matt: You guys are still on the same stealth roll as last time. You're fine. Grog?
Travis: 13.
Matt: 13.
Liam: What the fuck was that?
Laura: I don't know. Trinket's still in my necklace.
Matt: Trinket's still in your necklace.
Laura: I left him in because he healed. He's in my necklace.
Matt: He is.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right, so. As you guys turn the corner on the right side of this hallway, you saw this laboratory filled with bookshelves, chains, candelabras on the walls, a large door across the back wall. There are two pillars in the center of the room that are strewn with various magical engravings. You see this bunch of books scattered across the ground, pulled out of the bookcase, and there's one that's opened against this book-holding platform. You see two cages in the back of each corner that seem to contain some sort of slumped corpse or body of some kind. It's hard to see in the low light of this room because the only light you're getting is from the candelabras in the space. There you see the woman with long, dark green hair, silverish pale skin, robes, piercing eyes of yellow and emerald. As the rest of your party catches up from behind you with the ever-so-subtle sounds of metallic footfalls and plated armor against plated armor, the female figure seems unfazed by it and just continues to turn a page and grab another book. Takes a book and reads a passage of it and throws it off in the corner. There's a pause before the female figure stops, and still facing away, begins to speak out into the air of the room. "Well, you certainly proved quicker than I anticipated, but I unfortunately have business here, and I would kindly ask you all to leave. The Conclave has served its purpose, as you have served yours. We have nothing more to discuss." Turns another page of the book and continues facing away.
Liam: Can I look at the ceiling, every other part of this room except for where she is, to see if she's also somewhere else?
Matt: Sure, make a perception check.
Travis: I think we should just leave. (all laugh)
Liam: 22.
Matt: Okay. Glancing about, even with your low-light vision, the halls here are roughly 20 to 25 feet wide and about as much in height as well, 25 to 30 feet tall, carved arches. You don't see any other alcoves or hidden spaces. It appears to be just this figure in this room amongst the rotting corpse of Thordak and the two eggs tossed to the side.
Patrick rothfuss: I'm going to burn my final Divine Sense, just because I've never been exposed to this creature at all. She's got a lot of extra names like "the Diseased" and "the Corrupter" and whatever, so I don't know if she might be-- I have no idea. I'm just trying to draw a bead on whatever's in the room.
Matt: Right.
Patrick rothfuss: It's 60 feet, and I think it's fiends, corrupted, and undead. Location and type.
Matt: Correct, okay. So as you hear these words echoing through the hallway around you, the rest of the group, the tension rising. You watch as just through a quick glance, each ally in the room, their bodies just instinctually tighten, their muscles getting ready for anything at this point in time. You close your eyes and focus on the presence around you. You do not sense anything.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: No celestials, no fiends, no undead.
Laura: Did the party, as they were clomping along, did they catch up with us at all, or are they still that far back?
Matt: They're still this far back, nobody has-- this is where you guys stopped upon the discussion happening, so the twins are still up ahead. The rest of the party is halfway through this unit here. The actual chasm ends over on this side here, and this is the entranceway with the fountain you had discovered.
Travis: Somebody should roll off to the left.
Laura: Before any of that happens, though, I want to get Pike to step forward so she's within 30 feet of everybody. As many people as possible. Can she be right in the middle?
Matt: That's about as close to middle as she can get right now.
Marisha: Can we all move up a little bit?
Taliesin: I'm going to peel off a little bit to the left--
Laura: But wait just a fucking second so she can cast Beacon of Hope on everybody! Just one second. She's trying to help you.
Taliesin: I just got yelled at in my earpiece, so I will not--
Laura: Pike's like, "Just a fucking second! Let me cast Beacon of Hope!"
Taliesin: Sorry, sorry.
Travis: Pike swore.
Marisha: Pike!
Matt: What's the range on Beacon of Hope?
Laura: 30 feet.
Matt: 30 feet. All right. So that would get... that would be everybody. Everybody is currently under the effect of Beacon of Hope.
Sam: What does that mean?
Patrick rothfuss: Which is...
Sam: We are very hopeful now.
Laura: Which means that you are hopeful and vital.
Matt: Is it a perpetual radius of her, or does it affect each person at the time of casting?
Laura: It affects everybody at the time of casting.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I think. It just says range is 30 feet. Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points when healed.
Matt: Yes, that's correct. All of you guys have this effect on you as long as she maintains concentration. So keep tabs on maximum healing and wisdom saves and death saves.
Taliesin: Is she really there, or is that an illusion?
Laura: I can't tell. Can I tell if it's really an illusion, or does it look like she's really there?
Marisha: Can you sense her?
Taliesin: Yeah, try to sense.
Laura: Well, I couldn't sense her before when she was in her human form, so I'm assuming I can't sense her now.
Marisha: Like she's got something masking her, that whole thing?
Laura: Yeah, I mean.
Travis: She's the Deceiver.
Laura: I did the dragon-sense right before we came down this hallway and I sensed three dragons down here.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Right. Okay.
Matt: Okay. In the time it's taken you guys to deliberate and discuss this, and the long awkward pause that's transpired after Raishan said the previous thing she did, her voice picks up once again and says, "Whereabouts is your brass pet?"
Laura: Whereabouts are you?
Matt: No response.
Marisha: Keyleth steps forward a little bit towards the twins.
Travis: Percy and Grog are going to roll off to the left.
Taliesin: We're peeling off to the left, and I'm going to wall-walk. I'm going to keep going until I'm on line-of-sight with the red eggs against the back wall.
Matt: You can get there.
Travis: Cool.
Taliesin: Not that far, not even that far, like there. Yeah.
Liam: I would like to move across from my sister and move forward up to-- I can't tell from the overview, but a little bit of rock's right there?
Matt: Right there, yeah.
Liam: And stay hidden.
Matt: There?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Keyleth just says, "Did you find what you were looking for?"
Matt: "I did, actually. I discovered Thordak's original intent. Before the soul anchor drove him insane and he lost sight of his purpose. Well, it appears that it holds the same answer that I've been seeking as well. So. In a word: yes."
Marisha: And this is the answer to your... disease you were looking for? Your curse?
Matt: "Perhaps."
Marisha: I'm assuming it has something to do with the soul gem. Do you think you can resist the same type of madman mentality that Thordak fell victim to when you anchor yourself?
Matt: Still facing away, you see the shoulders shift with a chuckle. "I would not dare touch such a piece. It is far too dangerous. The soul gem is destroyed. It is of no use to me."
Laura: While that conversation's going on, I want to bamf Trinket out and send him around the other way.
Travis: To the left?
Matt: Around this way?
Laura: With Grog.
Matt: Okay, have Trinket roll a stealth check, if you could.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Being a big bear.
Laura: Come on, Trinket! You're so quiet-- ooh! Trinket rolls a 19.
Travis: Why a stealth check?
Sam: Maybe the lair or something.
Laura: Well maybe she doesn't know Trinket's here.
Patrick rothfuss: I'll move up a little bit, too.
Matt: To how far?
Patrick rothfuss: Enough so that hopefully I can get as many people within ten feet as possible, and ideally within 30 feet, if I need to rush and attack.
Matt: Okay. Currently, you are in a space to get three people in your area. You could either move forward with them, or if you wish to push forward on your own, you are currently not visible.
Patrick rothfuss: Right, yeah.
Matt: Okay. Kima is going to follow along with Grog and Trinket. Allura feels the lack of magical force on this side, is going to follow up behind you guys as well.
Travis: I'm over there. (all laugh)
Matt: Even with her hood up, she gives you a glance like--
Travis: Stay behind me.
Matt: Well, of course I am, that's part of the reason.
Marisha: Magic Grog, the Magic Mike sequel.
Matt: Scanlan?
Sam: I'll inch up a little, still hiding behind those outcroppings there, and then I'm going to call out the dog.
Laura: Ooh, nice! Pike's going to walk to the middle, where she's in between the two parties.
Taliesin: Ooh, that's really clever.
Sam: I'm going to summon the dog. I just say, "Good doggy!" Right? And I throw the figurine.
Liam: (posh voice) Hello. (all laugh)
Laura: Like Reginald or something? What was his name?
Sam: I forget-- we never figured out his name. We know it, or something. You said-- it was very cryptic.
Marisha: I did write it down at one point in time, but I'm not going to look for it right now.
Matt: The dog hops out. I'll use this badger for the time being.
Sam: You put a badger down?
Matt: I couldn't find an actual dog figure.
Marisha: The badger? That's even better!
Liam: I've got a mastiff. I'll donate it.
Matt: It still works fine!
Sam: Badger doesn't give a shit.
Laura: And then Pike wants to walk in between the two parties, so hiding behind that wall outcropping.
Matt: Okay. All right. At this point, the air itself is still very still, and the closer you get to this as you approach, the smell of decay is as overwhelming as it was in the chasm that you crossed before. Raishan continues to speak and says, "You may also come to notice a curiosity about this island that explains a lot of the legends around it. Sadly, the pressures of time left me forgetting until I arrived, which has limited my options. I had only used the glyph once before, years ago, but... it is as it is. So I ask you once again: we made a deal. You rescinded on that deal and punishment was required. You survive only by my grace and your stubborn need to cling to your insignificant lives. Regardless, I have what I sought now, and I offer you this opportunity to leave freely. Decline, and you choose your resting place here, away from your loved ones, to be forgotten and join the undying dregs of a long-passed madman's fancy."
Travis: Somebody do something.
Sam: Maybe we should just leave.
Marisha: Keyleth steps forward again, a little bit more, and says--
Matt: You bump into the shoulders--
Marisha: "Excuse me. Sorry. I just want to, I just, okay." I want to keep walking up to her as much as I can.
Matt: Okay. So you step out of the shadows.
Marisha: Yes.
Patrick rothfuss: Shit, I've got to follow-- if I see her moving-- I can't. I'm not good with that.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I would also, on the other side, like to advance as far as I can without reaching her eyeline.
Matt: You would be about there. Kima sneaks up behind you, Trinket follows up behind there, and Allura stays just to one side there.
Marisha: While all this is happening, Keyleth is speaking to try and keep her attention. "You know, Raishan, you've taught me a lot about myself, these past few weeks; arguably more than I've learned about myself my entire years of living."
Matt: "Good. I'm glad I could enlighten and inspire in these final moments."
Marisha: Inspiration's a word I guess you could use. I would say more of a cautionary tale. In an odd way, I hope I never become you. All those years of long life That some many call a blessing. I'm sure there are many lonely moments, and I hope, in my darkest of times, I don't turn to rage and anger and selfish actions the way you did.
Matt: "You know nothing about me, child. Nothing."
Marisha: That may be true.
Matt: She turns around for the first time to meet your eyes, and you can see the gleam of bright, sickly yellow and dark, deep emerald green for pupils as she turns with a slight smile just curling across her porcelain skin.
Marisha: I see I have your attention after all.
Matt: "You've had my attention since you entered this place. You aren't the subtlest of adventurers."
Marisha: No. We... I mean, we know. (all laugh)
Taliesin: That's what I was waiting for. Thank you.
Marisha: Touche.
Matt: "So what is it? You've come here to speak on your enlightenment and die? Or do we wish to maintain the agreement we had, go our own separate ways--"
Sam: I'm going to really quickly whisper to the dog, "Do you see anything that we don't?"
Matt: The dog looks around. "No."
Sam: Good doggy.
Marisha: You're correct. We reneged on our deal, just as you did on your end. There was a mutual distrust. We knew that from the beginning.
Matt: "That makes us even, then, does it not?"
Marisha: It does. But, in terms of negotiation, you presented your deal, so we will now present ours.
Laura: I'm backing up, but I'm drawing an arrow and just notching it and waiting to see if she does anything to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: My want for revenge against you, while still strong and very palpable, I now understand was ultimately selfish only in the sense that everyone else in Tal'Dorei should share in the revelry of bringing you to justice. I am not the only one-- we are not the only ones-- who have felt the ramifications of your destructive actions. And as much as I would like to make do on my promise that I told you weeks ago, and end your life right now, I desperately want the rest of Tal'Dorei to feel that satisfaction as well. So. You surrender now, you come with us under means of temporary control, we take you back to Emon-- maybe the Fire Ashari; we'll work that out, we're going to take you and you face trial amongst the Tal'Dorei Council, the people of the Ashari, and on behalf of the rest of the citizens of Exandria. If you choose to not take this offer, then I guess we will see whose final resting place it will be in this cave.
Matt: The book that she currently had in her hands closes in her grasp as her eyes don't flicker or shift or blink from your connection. She looks to you with her chin raised a bit.
Marisha: I mirror her. Puff up a little bit.
Matt: You act as though the laws of the anthill affect the foot that crushes it. You speak words of importance, but I've seen laws and people come and go, change, die, turn to dust and rise again. People kill neighbor. Families die from the inside and out. You see, I'm diseased, but look upon you. You insignificant creatures. You do more to your own people than I've done in an entire lifetime.
Marisha: That might be true, but at least that is the fate of our own consequences and our own doing, not some outwardly force forcing their repercussions on us. And you should know, Raishan, I've stepped on plenty of anthills in my day. Those that don't die revolt. And guess what? There are some pretty nasty stings from some ants out there.
Laura: They'll leave a welt. You'll itch for days.
Marisha: The strength of a colony is stronger than the individual of one great diseased foot.
Matt: "You are truly not intending to leave me be, are you?"
Marisha: Nope.
Matt: "Well, that is such an unfortunate disposition on your part. Interestingly enough--" And she thumbs a couple of pages in the next book, closes it, and throws it to the side. "My needs do happen to call for a handful of powerful magic-users. And there are proper tools within these caverns to keep you in line. So we shall call your foolishness kismet."
Marisha: I guess we can say the same for yours. I guess it's a matter of who wins, now.
Matt: Very well.
Marisha: I'm giving you one last shot.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark her. At 2nd level, because that's what I have.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Same.
Matt: What do you do?
Liam: Hunter's Mark.
Marisha: Surrender, and if you choose not to, at least we can go forward in our consciences and know that we gave you a choice.
Matt: So as you guys are casting the spell and she's saying this, Raishan responds with, "I shall relish closing the final chapter on your brief, pitiful tales, and beginning a fresh, new chapter of my own." As you guys both mark, the spell has no effect, takes no root in the space. You maintain concentration, but nothing was marked. There is nothing there, physical.
Taliesin: The dog, in theory, sees invisible things, by the way.
Sam: It's not invisible. She's not there.
Marisha: Is she a hologram? Is she an illusion?
Travis: What are we doing?
Matt: What are you doing? Aside from rolling initiative, which I think probably would be a good thing to do right now. So let's go ahead and roll initiative now.
Marisha: Wait. That's the dead body of Thordak, right?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: She's not possessing Thordak, is she? She's speaking through him--
Liam: No, the paladin checked for undead.
Laura: I sensed three dragons.
Marisha: Oh, undead, that's right.
Patrick rothfuss: I would've probably sensed, unless there's some sort of masking going on here.
Laura: Which she's good at.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Oh man, I don't like hearing that.
Marisha: Lucky green, lucky green, come on!
Taliesin: (laughs) I'm sorry.
Marisha: Ah, if it wasn't so ironic...
Laura: That's a bad Taliesin laugh.
Taliesin: (singing) It's like rain...
Taliesin: (singing) On your wedding day!
Marisha: (singing) On your wedding day!
Travis: Please do not sing that song.
Taliesin: We'll be doomed to die if we sing that song any further.
Matt: So. Folks. Initiative tracking going down now. We have 25 to 20.
Liam: 25.
Laura: 24.
Taliesin: 22.
Sam: 21.
Patrick rothfuss: Jeez!
Marisha: Thank god you guys are alive. Thank fuck.
Matt: 25, 24?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. All right. 20 to 15?
Travis: 16.
Patrick rothfuss: Did you roll for Pike?
Laura: Yeah, I did, I rolled for Pike. She got eight, Pike got eight.
Matt: Pike got eight. Keyleth, what did you get?
Marisha: Four!
Matt: Kerrek?
Patrick rothfuss: You don't add proficiency bonus. It's only a dex bonus, right?
Matt: Just dex bonus, correct.
Patrick rothfuss: Then 11.
Matt: Okay. So we have...
Taliesin: You don't add proficiency bonus?
Patrick rothfuss: That's what I was asking about for dex. For initiative, rather.
Marisha: I think that's you, because you're a fancy fighter.
Taliesin: I'm weird, okay. That's a weird thing.
Travis: So Keyleth got the lowest? You got the lowest one?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: I was talking. I was giving a very compelling speech.
Travis: Yeah, I was writing it down. With my inability to write.
Matt: All righty. So. Top of the round, currently. Vax, what are you doing?
Liam: And we see nothing.
Matt: You see nothing now. You just see the apparently not-physically-there humanoid form of Raishan, still standing on the opposite side.
Liam: And two eggs.
Matt: Two eggs here, and the corpse.
Liam: All right, I'm going to cross back across, north, to the-- I mean, I click on the Boots of Haste. I'm going to move straight towards you, Matt, across the hall so I'm by the corner there.
Matt: Over here?
Liam: No, not that far. No, closer to me. Right there. And I'm going to throw at the eggs.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And it's... I'm going first, so with Assassinate, I get advantage on all these because I'm the first to go in combat? Yes? Yep.
Matt: Sure.
Liam: Starting at third level, you are deadly, so you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet.
Matt: Okay. Sure. The eggs have not taken a turn in the combat yet.
Liam: That's great. And I'm going to use sharpshooter, so I get a negative five on these.
Travis: The eggs have't taken a turn yet.
Matt: Vax'ildan, the Egg Assassin.
Liam: Yeah! 21 for the first.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay.
Travis: (trailer voice) This Easter, the eggs have not taken a turn.
Matt: (trailer voice) Prepare to be scrambled.
Liam: (laughing) The second one is 18.
Matt: 18 hits.
Liam: Okay. And that is-- oh, that's not that good. Is 14.
Matt: 14? Okay.
Liam: Do they all three hit, or just the first two?
Matt: First two.
Liam: First two. Okay. So the first one gets sneak attack damage.
Laura: Those eggs don't even know you're coming.
Liam: That's right. What, you want them to take less damage?
Laura: Oh no.
Liam: Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Matt: These eggs are caught unaware.
Taliesin: This'll be over easy.
Travis: Taliesin.
Taliesin: I'm so proud. So proud. (all laugh)
Liam: 32 for that one.
Patrick rothfuss: Eggcellent. (all groan)
Patrick rothfuss: I didn't start this, but I will finish it.
Liam: And what the heck, I'm going to poison that egg, so that is (laughing) Seven. That egg has to make a DC 15 success against poison. (all laugh)
Matt: Succeeds with a natural 17.
Liam: So, does it get half? Or... half, right? Or none? I don't know. I've never killed an egg before.
Matt: I mean, it still takes the full sneak attack damage, and it is not poisoned.
Liam: Not poisoned. So give it another seven hit points of damage from the dagger itself.
Matt: A total of...?
Liam: Seven for that second attack. The earlier one was 32. Isn't Dungeons and Dragons fun?
Laura: Eggs, you guys. Eggs.
Matt: So as you rush past, and careening around the corner, throwing these three daggers out to the side, the first one just smacks into the side, and the egg, which had already been previously damaged structure-wise by a somewhat resistant but still impactful burst of druidic magic energy in the previous conflict, the first dagger cuts through like a hot knife through butter, out the side of the egg. You watch as the shell on the other side just scatters, causing this splatter of some sort of thick liquid against the wall. The other two daggers, one just careens off to the side, the second one that does impact continues and causes the egg to actually crack and fold in on itself, causing it to leak out the side of the shell as it collapses in on itself somewhat.
Sam: That's one egg down?
Matt: So that egg there I will mark as currently--
Laura: Scrambled.
Marisha: Sunny side up.
Matt: Destroyed.
Taliesin: Florentine.
Travis: Benedict.
Laura: Poached.
Matt: There you go. That one is destroyed.
Taliesin: Poached.
Matt: All right. Does that end your turn?
Liam: Yeah, I'll stick with it.
Matt: Okay. Next up is Vex.
Laura: That's me. I'm going to immediately say over the earring, "I don't think she's really there," and then try to look and see anything, any sign of her that I can spot. Can I see anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 30.
Matt: 30. Glancing around you in the current space, that is definitively an illusion, and in fact the way it shimmers-- and you look at the books that it was using and messing with. While you were keeping more of an eye on the area, you notice now that the books that she dropped just vanished.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: It was all part of the illusion. Definitely not there, but you don't see anything around you that resembles a hidden or stealthed dragon-sized creature.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: What else would you like to do with your turn?
Laura: Fuck. I think I'm going to save-- I'm going to back up against the wall, just straight back.
Matt: Right here?
Laura: Yeah. Because I feel very uncomfortable with the situation and I'm going to save my attack for if Thordak moves, if anything moves at all, I'm going to wait to attack it.
Matt: Attack it? So you're holding your attack action in case something moves.
Laura: Yeah. In case Thordak moves or I see Raishan or something.
Matt: Okay, cool. Percival. Still on this back wall here.
Taliesin: Okay. First things first. I'm going to take a shot with Bad News at the remaining egg.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So let's just do that. Why are you doing that? Okay, good. That's a 22 to hit?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: So that's... ooh, that's nice. 25 points of damage.
Matt: All righty. The first shot hits. You see the front of the egg spider-crack inward, like how you shot in the Thordak battle, but the egg still holds firm. As you begin loading for your next shot, you watch as part of the egg begins to crack outward, like something's pushing out from the inside of the egg.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind. Then I'm going to take another-- okay, I'm going to take another Sharpshooter shot at it. I'm going to try to hit it and kill it dead. Yeah, I'm having a weird premonition that's making me really uncomfortable. 16?
Matt: 16 to hit?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: With its armor, that probably won't hit, unfortunately. The bullet ricochets off the outside of the hardened eggshell and just (ricochet sound).
Liam: I don't know if it makes a difference, I called Sharpshooter on my shots before but forgot to add the additional ten per attack.
Matt: You destroyed the egg. You threw them all simultaneously at a single egg.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: Did you add ten to yours just now?
Taliesin: No, sharpshooter I lose five to hit, which is why I didn't hit it, but I get ten extra points of damage. I'm feeling like now is the time to take this out of play, so I'm going to burn an... Action Surge right now. I'm going to burn an Action Surge.
Matt: Sure, buddy.
Taliesin: And I'm going to take another shot with Bad News. (nerdy voice) Action Surge.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Same thing, sharpshooter shot.
Matt: Do it.
Travis: (nerdy voice) It's time for an Action Surge.
Liam: (nerdy voice) Raishan! (all laugh)
Taliesin: That misses.
Matt: Ricochets off again.
Taliesin: Oh man, regular shot, because fuck it.
Marisha: That's better!
Taliesin: That hits. That's 32 to hit. I should've just taken it. But that's okay, we'll see what we do damage-wise. That's not bad. 22 points of damage.
Matt: With the second shot, you tear the top half of the egg off. As it goes splattering to the side of it, you can watch as what looks to be some sort of a very, very young primordial dragon like the ones that you had yanked out of the eggs before that was trying to pull its way out of the egg, slumps lifelessly over the side of the egg you destroyed.
Sam: Aw. You're terrible, Taliesin. You're so hard-boiled.
Matt: That's awful.
Taliesin: I don't suppose I have time to run a weird perception check, do I? Really quickly? Do I have a moment for a perception check?
Matt: You've used all your action and your bonus action...
Taliesin: I haven't burned any movement, though.
Matt: What are you looking for?
Taliesin: Is that center wall real?
Matt: This center wall here? This would be an investigation check.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm calling that. 23?
Matt: 23. Glancing over across the way, best you can tell, the wall appears to be solid and is an actual, natural barrier in the cavern.
Taliesin: Okay, just wanted to have my moment.
Laura: Oh my god, that would've been so smart, though.
Taliesin: I had a moment of horror like, oh god, that's dragon-sized. Okay, cool.
Marisha: Yeah, that's her. It could still be her.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: He could've just not rolled high enough.
Matt: So that ends your turn. At the end of Percy's turn, the human figure across the way with the dark green hair gives a deep bow.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: And then vanishes from the field.
Laura: No.
Travis: That wasn't so bad.
Sam: We won!
Laura: Good job, guys.
Marisha: We just made her leave.
Matt: The dog turns around and faces this direction and starts barking.
Sam: Yes. Yes!
Taliesin: Good boy.
Matt: You just hear (heavy footsteps) and then suddenly (flapping wings), there's suddenly a torrent of wind blowing within the area as something is disturbing the air quite heavily. So that's that.
Laura: I am holding my action until Raishan does anything. I hope she attacks-- well no, I hope we get to attack her soon.
Matt: That's going to be the end of Raishan's turn.
Travis: Really? Just the sound?
Matt: Yeah. You all of a sudden hear the mastiff barking over and over again in this direction.
Laura: Do I see, did I-- oh god, I can't, it's not my turn.
Matt: But you don't see anything.
Laura: No. Did my hair go whoosh?
Matt: A little bit.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: It's kind of always doing that a little bit, though.
Laura: I mean, a little bit.
Matt: Scanlan, it's your turn.
Sam: I turn to face in the direction that my dog is looking. And... shitballs. Who's that near me back there?
Matt: This is Vex. That's Pike.
Sam: Okay. Vex I will inspire with a quick limerick.
Laura: Oh?
Sam: Gern Blanston wept and wept-o, his wonderful broom had been swept-o, first our Vex spied it, then she Shanghai'd it, because it turns out she's a total klepto. (all laugh)
Matt: You can take your d12 inspiration.
Laura: Bringing it back.
Sam: And then I will-- balls. I want to hold my thing to-- but I'm not going to. I'm going to hope this works and the dragon's coming at us. Maybe. I'm going to step forward as much as I can towards the sound I heard and blow my horn of fog just everywhere.
Liam: Can't you put that drug pipe down for like five seconds?
Sam: Don't take it away from me, man!
Travis: Blow one note.
Sam: It's for tobacco, okay? (all laugh)
Matt: All righty.
Patrick rothfuss: This is going to settle a lot of bets on who vapes.
Matt: All right, so yeah, 20-foot radius... so you create this area here, and obscures it. So currently, this whole tunnel is just filled with fog. You have no vision beyond the outside of it, right where you are.
Sam: All right. Good. But if something comes through, it will disturb the fog, correct?
Matt: It may.
Sam: Oh, shit. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Congratulations, we can play Laser Tag now.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: Yeah, I'll just say, "I think she's over here, guys!" And that's it.
Matt: All right, Grog, your turn.
Travis: I rage and-- I would like to rage.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: With my 50 feet of speed, can I try to make it to Thordak's corpse? See how far I get?
Marisha: Yes, yes, get it. Get it!
Matt: You get right up to it, yeah.
Travis: Okay, cool. Can I take-- I found out that the hammer, the dwarven thrower, is a versatile weapon.
Matt: Yeah, you can hold it with two hands if you'd like.
Travis: With two hands, can I take a shot at his big stupid cranium?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Okay. I want to squash the watermelon.
Matt: All right, roll for it.
Travis: Oh, reckless.
Matt: Sure. You didn't need it, but go for it.
Travis: Oh. Okay. Come on, crit on the dead skull-- natural 20!
Matt: Natural 20. (all laugh)
Travis: It's like a beached whale.
Matt: How do you want to do this, Grog?
Travis: I talk to the new dwarven thrower-hammer. "This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship!"
Matt: As you leap in the air, using the momentum of your leap, you smash the dwarven thrower down onto the already partially-destroyed skull of Thordak's corpse, the skull immediately caving inward with the force of the blow. As it hits and curves inward, it releases this sudden burst of heavy ash into your face that fills your lungs and burns your eyes, and you cough. As you pull back, you try and wedge the hammer out, and as you do, you can see there is actual molten rock still dripping off the outside of the hammer. Any sort of general normal unenchanted metal would probably be slightly bowing or melting in the presence of such heat. It looks like even in its dead state after a day of rest, Thordak's corpse still maintained some sort of internal volcanic life as it slowly subsided, but the skull is destroyed. You see bits of the upper palate just scattered like bone chunks across the stonework of the floor, stopping at the outside of one of the cages. Thordak's head is thoroughly destroyed.
Liam: J-E-L-L-O.
Travis: Well played. I have another hit, but I want to get close enough for it. With my bonus action, can I use the Boots of Feral Leaping to make a horizontal leap 20 feet towards the remaining egg?
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, the second egg did get destroyed.
Travis: Oh, they're all toast.
Matt: But you're welcome to, if you'd like.
Travis: I want to leap.
Laura: There's potentially corpses in those cages that could be something.
Travis: I'm focused on the egg, all right?
Laura: All right, sorry.
Travis: I leap toward the eggs.
Matt: Okay, how far can you leap?
Travis: 20 feet.
Matt: All right.
Travis: And I have to make a DC 16 athletics check.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: 18.
Matt: All right. So you (leaping sound). Not as far as you'd like, but that egg is staring you down. There is an unmoving baby dragon corpse that is-- you've got a date with your hammer.
Travis: If I touch down, may I throw the dwarven hammer at baby egg corpse?
Matt: Go for it. (all laugh)
Travis: Reckless.
Matt: Yeah, advantage. All your attacks are reckless, man.
Travis: Yes! Do it again! No, not quite.
Laura: That's okay, it's dead. It probably hits.
Travis: 24. (all laugh)
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: But this is just a d8 because it's one-handed, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: 21--
Matt: Plus an additional d8 because you threw it.
Liam: I don't know if we're going to kill Raishan, but we smoked those eggs.
Matt: It's part of the enchantment of the hammer.
Travis: I think it's just if it's a giant it's a 2d8. Yeah, you're right. Ranged attack. So that's 26 total.
Matt: 26 total. The currently-lifeless limp corpse of this nearly-hatched primordial dragon-- whatever this new entity was through the merger of the power of the soul anchor in the fire elemental plane and Thordak, the ancient red dragon, this remaining dragonkin-- is turned into red oatmeal against the table and the stone wall behind it.
Travis: Yeah! Start the morning right. Come back from that, bitches!
Matt: Well done, Grog.
Travis: No? We're not worried about that?
Taliesin: No, you're good.
Laura: Trinket's fighting every urge to go lick up the egg. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Oh, don't eat that. Don't eat that. No.
Laura: Come on, he's a bear.
Travis: I'm good.
Matt: You're good, all right. At the end of your turn--
Liam: That hall looks dangerous right where he is.
Matt: Let's see here.
Liam: There's two magical columns right there.
Travis: Those aren't even there at all.
Matt: Scanlan, you feel a strange, warm sensation in your chest--
Laura: Oh, you've been dispelled.
Marisha: Bitch.
Matt: Also at the end of your turn, Grog, or as soon as your turn ends, you hear this (undead inhale) strange sucking breath-like sound.
Travis: Don't do it. Listen, I like you the way you are. Don't--
Matt: (laughing) Make a perception check.
Travis: Oh yeah, that's a fucking five.
Matt: Five. You are talking fervently at your hammer. "Please--"
Travis: Please don't. Look, come on. In my previous relationship, I've been burned before. Okay? I want to start fresh.
Sam: Then I also lose my--
Taliesin: No, that's only-- well, that may be something else. That's Beacon of Hope. That's a different thing.
Matt: That'll do it.
Marisha: But is it still dispelled?
Taliesin: It depends on what she dispelled.
Matt: The time you're focusing on the hammer, you aren't paying attention to your surroundings until you just see the shadows coalescing closer to you than you expect, and by the time you look up, you watch as two black smoked, wraith-like entities that had slowly pulled themselves out of the two cages on the sides have shifted beside and lashed out at you.
Travis: (shrieks) I scream like I'm in a haunted house. (all laugh)
Sam: You are in a haunted house.
Marisha: Yeah, I was just going to say, I've seen that. That's legit.
Travis: I jump like a bitch. The Boots of Feral Leaping are nothing, y'all.
Marisha: Halloween Horror Nights is only fun when watching him.
Matt: 19 to hit.
Travis: Oh, that hits.
Matt: They have advantage against you. I forgot. So 19 and the other hit is two and a 22.
Travis: Both hit.
Matt: So both hit you. All righty. You suffer 21 points of necrotic damage from the first hit.
Travis: Necrotic, huh?
Sam: You don't have anything against that.
Travis: I'm going to Forrest Gump up this bitch. Real quick.
Matt: And 20 points of necrotic damage, so a total of?
Travis: 42.
Matt: 41 points of necrotic damage.
Travis: 41, 21 and 20.
Matt: I need you to make two constitution saving throws.
Patrick rothfuss: Which I think we have advantage on right now.
Travis: Is this a saving throw or just a constitution--
Laura: Oh yeah. Well, wisdom.
Matt: You have advantage on wisdom. This is a constitution save.
Patrick rothfuss: It was from the Hero's Feast.
Matt: Hero's Feast isn't constitution, it's wisdom.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, sorry.
Travis: Minus two to everything, right?
Matt: You're at minus two to everything.
Travis: That is a three minus two equals one.
Liam: It's not a natural one, though.
Matt: And the second hit?
Travis: Is an 11.
Matt: All right. So your maximum hit points are also reduced by 41 as both of the wraiths drain the life force out of you, their claws rake through your body like it's nothing, and as they pull back, you feel the breath sucked from your lungs, and you instinctually cough for a second, almost stumbling to one knee, as both the wraiths chuckle at the side of your face.
Laura: I feel like we aren't taking this seriously enough, you guys. 'Cause I feel like this could be really bad, right now.
Sam: No, no, we made some good omelets.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: All righty. Kerr.
Sam: This is important work.
Liam: The room was empty.
Matt: You watched this happen.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Matt: Over here, as well as seeing the fog cloud suddenly fill the opposite side of the cavern, and for a brief moment, you're-- you feel like you're a little bit out of your element, but you click in and your combat sense kicks in. What do you want to do?
Patrick rothfuss: This is my game, right there. Horrible things from beyond the grave. Plus--
Marisha: What up, paladin!
Patrick rothfuss: -- my new boyfriend is in a bad way, so.
Travis: That's me. This guy.
Sam: I missed one episode.
Travis: Total Kerr-bear.
Patrick rothfuss: I've got movement of 30, that'll get me up there?
Liam: Play-date!
Matt: Yeah. You have five, ten, 15, 20, 25, you can get right-- you can go 30 and get right next to both of them, if you'd like.
Patrick rothfuss: There's probably advantages to that.
Matt: Up to you. Doesn't matter.
Taliesin: There's advantages to both.
Taliesin: There's advantages to both. (all laugh)
Marisha: There's advantages to both. (all laugh)
Patrick rothfuss: I will make one attack, the one closer to me for lack of a better choice.
Matt: Go for it.
Patrick rothfuss: 25.
Matt: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, now, I'm not going out on a limb here thinking that this is an undead creature?
Matt: This-- in your time, and you've come across quite a few undead creatures, based on what you've walked through in this endeavor? You-- while he did not see it, you watched these things rise out of the pile of corpses that are jammed at the bottom of each of these small cages. You have a pretty good sense that these are undead.
Patrick rothfuss: I misjudged the scale before, I thought my Divine Sense was big enough to cover this whole area.
Matt: Right.
Patrick rothfuss: So I am going to use my paladin ability, and I'm going to burn a first-level spell slot for my special paladin ability.
Matt: Divine Smite?
Patrick rothfuss: Yes, Divine Smite.
Matt: All righty. So that is 2d8--
Patrick rothfuss: Plus a d8 because they're undead.
Matt: Undead, so plus 3d8 to your attack damage.
Marisha: Oh, hell yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah, so.
Travis: Dammit.
Patrick rothfuss: Four, and then another 11 is 15 plus one more is... 31 radiant damage.
Marisha: Fuck yeah.
Matt: Ooh. So as you rush in--
Liam: But he's only seventh-level!
Matt: From your perspective, Keyleth, you watch as this flash of light, and from thin air you watch armored Kerrek just streak down with his glowing-headed warhammer, and slamming the side of this wraith-like entity. As it hits, you watch as the creature turns, the radiant energy just consuming part of its torso in the blast, and it shrieks out in pain as the radiant energy tends to burn the side of its undead form with a secondary flash as the divine energy bursts outward. That-- you watched the wraith go from eager and smooth to looking like it's shimmering in place and its form is starting to shake and hold itself present.
Marisha: Keyleth just says, "I've never seen a gardener do that." (all laugh)
Taliesin: Landscaper.
Marisha: (laughs) Landscaper.
Patrick rothfuss: And I will take my second attack.
Matt: Same one?
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Taliesin: Jesus.
Patrick rothfuss: That is not as good. Now, if I'm coming in invisible, do I get advantage due to surprise?
Matt: On the first strike you would've, yes.
Patrick rothfuss: Only the first, okay. So this is a 17.
Matt: 17 still hits.
Patrick rothfuss: Yay. And I will burn another spell slot.
Matt: Go for it.
Patrick rothfuss: I don't want these hanging around.
Matt: So weapon damage plus 3d8.
Liam: Divern Smert!
Patrick rothfuss: Eight... 16-- oh! um. 16 plus 13, somebody help out the English major.
Matt: 29.
Liam: Oh, good roll.
Patrick rothfuss: And 35. And, just to let you know, the Dusk Hammer also gives me plus 1d8 against undead. So I'm taking that extra one too. So those of you at home see I'm not fucking around.
Matt: Yeah, it's actually the ability of the weapon. Okay, so.
Patrick rothfuss: 35 radiant.
Sam: Rothfuss.
Matt: Nice.
Sam: OP.
Patrick rothfuss: That's how we do at level seven, folks. (all laugh)
Matt: As the second strike, using the momentum of the first swing, you pull back and backhand it right in the face. As it cuts clean through with no resistance, the wraith seems to scatter, and the shadow reforms in the space it was, but barely. It's like--
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, you're kidding me.
Matt: You're watching as part of it is flickering and bits of shadow are dripping and disappearing into the stonework behind, and its original kind of chuckling evil hungry visage is now this fearful "oh shit" look on its spectral, skeletal face.
Travis: (singing) My boyfriend's back and you're going to be in trouble.
All: (singing with terrible harmonizing) Hey-na hey-na my boyfriend's back. (all laugh)
Matt: That got weird.
Laura: That was like the Addams Family version of 'My Boyfriend's Back'.
Taliesin: I am so pleased that got so awful.
Matt: Really terrible.
Travis: Somebody's cat at home just died. That was awful.
Marisha: Just exploded.
Taliesin: I might get my socks back, I'm very excited.
Matt: That ends Kerrek's turn--
Marisha: They have only five hit points. We know this. Kitten damage.
Patrick rothfuss: When Invisibility goes off, is my displacer cloak still in effect? Do those things layer or--
Matt: Yeah, they're still in effect.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: You have three things you could attune to, and so--
Patrick rothfuss: Right.
Matt: While the ring is no longer invisible and--
Patrick rothfuss: I know that'll be out for a while.
Matt: That's out for a while, but the cloak is still in effect, and your hammer is still in effect.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Liam: The way that cloak goes is they're at disadvantage if they hit you once, then it goes away until the start of your next round.
Patrick rothfuss: Next turn.
Liam: It keeps resetting.
Patrick rothfuss: I was mostly wondering, if I was invisible and displaced, if they can detect invisible do they see me displaced? But let's not worry about that until it becomes an issue.
Matt: Yeah, yeah. Well, in this circumstance, since you're no longer, since you are visible for the foreseeable future, it won't make any difference.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: But if you were invisible, the invisibility would take over, they'd have disadvantage against attacking you anyway, but they'd have to know where you were to even try and make an attack, is how it would work.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Taliesin: Just somebody somewhere is dropping the bass.
Matt: Okay. So ending Kerr's turn... Pike feels--
Sam: Oh shit.
Matt: A warm sensation within her chest, a familiar one.
Sam: Oh boy.
Matt: Let's see here.
Sam: What just got dispelled?
Laura: Probably the feast.
Liam: Maybe.
Laura: That's what happened before.
Matt: So that's Kima's turn.
Laura: And the Beacon of Hope.
Matt: Kima's currently seeing these wraith- like entities start rushing into the room. One two three four five...
Travis: Oh yeah, this is her wheelhouse.
Matt: She--
Laura: Oh yeah, good thing we brought Kima.
Matt: -- movement-wise can't quite get all the way up to where they are now, but she gets her hammer at the ready, and Kima's going to go ahead and... let's see.
Liam: Oh, we got three paladins.
Matt: She's going to go ahead and cast Crusader's Mantle on herself.
Travis: What was it? Crusader's Mantle?
Matt: Crusader's Mantle is the ability. While she maintains concentration on it-- actually, you know what? No, I take that back. She's going to cast Aura of Vitality, which means she can use her bonus action to heal an ally within 30 feet for 2d6 damage.
Laura: Nice.
Matt: Um, so she casts that on herself. She's going to-- seeing you damaged, Grog--
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: -- she's going to use her bonus action to attempt to heal you 2d6, however, your maximum hit points have been lowered, so it has no effect on you, and she realizes this as she reaches out and, "Grog!" This bit of divine energy streaks from her hand, hits you, and seems to just peter out on impact. "Shit." And she steels herself with her weapon, getting ready for the next round of onslaught. Finishing Kima's turn, it is now Allura's turn.
Patrick rothfuss: Luckily, though, because of Pike's spell, the damage you didn't heal was maximum.
Travis: Oh, that's good.
Liam: (laughs)
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Well that's just math.
Laura: I didn't follow any of that.
Liam: Silver lining, silver lining.
Travis: I replied in a positive way because I didn't know any better.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: We're probably going to want to destroy those cages, by the way.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Destroy them?
Taliesin: I think that we're going to get more wraiths.
Marisha: Just coming out--
Liam: Did they come out of the cages?
Patrick rothfuss: They came out of the corpses in the-- I think there's only one corpse in each cage.
Liam: I think they're like gauntlet generators and they're just like--
Taliesin: Quick point of order--
Matt: Yes?
Marisha: Spawners.
Taliesin: Is there like corpse soup in those cages, or is it one corpse per cage?
Matt: You can't really see from your perspective this far away.
Taliesin: Well, fair.
Patrick rothfuss: I wondered that same thing. (all laugh)
Matt: For the sake of paying attention, go ahead and make a perception check.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm heading that way anyway, so.
Patrick rothfuss: 11-ish.
Matt: 11. It's hard to tell in the low light from the candelabra. It does look like, from the view here, there's at least two corpses in one of the cages. Like a pile. There's one that's slumped forward, but you can see more than two legs.
Marisha: Total spawn location.
Matt: All right, so for Allura's turn she is going to--
Patrick rothfuss: My god, was that the Gauntlet?
Matt: --walk away from this area, Kima's got this, she steps over to this side, knowing that with the dog barking off to the side, that's definitely a sign that the dragon's coming from this direction. She pulls her hood back and she will cast-- she's actually going to hold her action. She's going to begin casting-- what would be a good one for this one? She's going to begin casting Disintegrate once something attempts to move by.
Liam: Savage.
Travis: Page out of Gilmore's book.
Matt: She's going to hold that as an action. All right, that brings us to Pike's turn.
Laura: (Pike voice) Yeah! Pike is going to cast--
Travis: (Pike voice) Yeah!
Laura: (Pike voice) Yeah!
Liam: (Pike voice) I'm going to--
Laura: (Pike voice) I'm going to-- Pike's going to cast Spiritual Weapon at level four.
Marisha: She would totally do that.
Laura: Right?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Liam: (Pike voice) In the shape of a--
Matt: She's putting it where?
Laura: She's putting it right in the middle of the hallway.
Matt: There?
Laura: (Pike voice) Yeah.
Matt: All righty. Radiant sword appears in the center of the air.
Sam: Right behind me.
Matt: Right behind you, yeah.
Sam: That's disconcerting.
Laura: And then-- oh no, it's protection, Scanlan.
Sam: Ah, okay.
Laura: And then she's going to use-- I guess that's only within ten feet.
Liam: Can she move?
Laura: She's going to cast Light. Just to create a little bit of better vision. On that pile of rocks in the middle of that.
Matt: Here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So it's now a very bright--
Laura: Very bright!
Matt: -- area here now in the center of the hallway. All righty.
Laura: I'm thinking maybe that'll help spot Raishan or something.
Sam: Sure, yeah, yeah, great--
Matt: That ends Pike's turn.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okey-dokey. Whatcha doing?
Taliesin: I was just trying to see if I could actually get, it was giving me a problem.
Marisha: To get it to work? Is that like a stalactite?
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah.
Marisha: Interesting. Okay. Keyleth is going to move a couple closer to the wall, that's she's close--
Matt: This wall here?
Marisha: Yes. Two. Forward a little bit, going towards this tunnel. Other way, other way.
Matt: Other way.
Travis: Taliesin literally has the laser pointer.
Marisha: Right there's good, that's good. Thank you. He is literally-- yeah. Can I take my bonus action to do a perception check and see if I can sense any faint movements, fog being moved, pebbles being kicked?
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Gotta get a natural twenty on that.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: 21, okay. You can see the fog cloud, there is a heavy swirling in the cloud. Looks like the fog, which is stationary because the magical effect of the spell creates it within a vicinity, the fog itself is (whooshing noises). And occasionally you see what looks to be almost a big gust rapidly right at the outskirts of it.
Marisha: I got you, bitch. All right. I want to do right overtop of Scanlan's fog cloud, I want to do Faerie Fire. Glitterbomb.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Glitterbomb, yeah.
Marisha: Glitterbomb.
Laura: Ugh, so annoying!
Taliesin: Oh god, it's everywhere.
Laura: Jesus, we're never going to get it off!
Marisha: Oh, man. I'm never going to Labyrinth again.
Taliesin: The next three bathtubs, glitter.
Matt: As you step out of the way, coming towards the fog cloud, you focus it and you begin to bring your fingers across to deliver the incantation of Faerie Fire, and you watch a sudden slow blue spark of energy from inside the fog cloud. Just within, so it's like a little firework in a cloud, and when it happens, your spell fizzles at the tip of your fingers.
Marisha: She fucking counterspelled me.
Sam: Or legendaried it away.
Marisha: Or legendaried it away. She's in the fucking cloud, you guys.
Sam: Seems like it.
Marisha: She's uploaded herself to the cloud.
Liam: Druid's going country.
Marisha: Look. Never forget your roots.
Travis: Going country!
Taliesin: This is why you never upload anything to the cloud.
Matt: That brings us to the top of the round--
Marisha: Yeah, the cloud could get hacked.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Marisha: It's a Black Mirror episode all of a sudden.
Liam: Uh... shite. Are there still dead things with Groggy?
Matt: Correct, there are two of them flanking him currently.
Patrick rothfuss: They're full of piss and vinegar.
Liam: I'm going to attack them. I'm going to throw, but I'm going to go one dagger at the one above him.
Matt: This one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Patrick rothfuss: I think the one on this side is the one that's hurt most.
Liam: On this side.
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah.
Liam: Okay.
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah, that's the one that I roughed up real bad.
Liam: They were both roughed up real bad.
Patrick rothfuss: No, I hit one of them twice.
Matt: He attacked one, one is untouched, one is flickering.
Liam: So the one that's fucked up I will attack.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So I'll throw one at that. That is good. That is a 31.
Matt: 31 hits.
Patrick rothfuss: Jeez.
Travis: Pretty sure.
Liam: Yep. And I'll throw-- yeah, I'll throw another one at that one.
Matt: Same one? The damaged one?
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Don't you want to see how much damage--
Liam: That is 18. Can I wait and see how much damage I do?
Matt: Yeah, you can roll damage.
Liam: Oh, then yeah, then I'll just attack one at a time, I'll save that roll, though, for the next. So that is two plus eight is ten. Plus...
Laura: Is there anything standing next to it?
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah, a bunch of us.
Liam: Oh, Grog is, so it's flanked!
Laura: So it's Sneak Attack!
Liam: So it's Sneak Attack. Thanks, buddy.
Laura: (whispering) I'm your sister.
Liam: You're also my buddy. 16.
Marisha: You ain't my guy, friend.
Taliesin: You ain't my friend.
Liam: I mean, it's got to be gone.
Laura: Whoa.
Patrick rothfuss: A bajillionty damage.
Matt: Yeah. It screams as its shadowed form is sent to join the rest of the shadows in the room, unmoving, cold, and without life or undeath.
Liam: Okay, then the next two--
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: The first one gets 18.
Matt: 18 hits. Vex, you're up next, by the way.
Liam: And then the second one is a 17.
Matt: Also hits.
Liam: Okay, so there it goes. I'm going to roll this one. That's three plus eight is 11 plus the psychic damage has gone missing--
Marisha: Oh, fuck!
Liam: Where is everything, where's my dice? 18 for the first.
Matt: 18 damage.
Liam: Eight for the second.
Matt: Eight damage?
Travis: Help me!
Matt: Eight damage for the second one, without the attack modifier, right?
Liam: Without the attack?
Matt: So you don't add your dex, you don't add your dex bonus for the offhand attack.
Liam: Oh, sorry, so, well if I rolled a two, okay. So then just two.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So 18 plus two, 20.
Matt: Okay. So both of the daggers, after destroying the one, slam into it, and the magical effect of them manages to cause the form to shimmer slightly with the impact as the daggers pass through and then vanish on the opposite side of the room, returning to your side. The creature seems to have taken a few hits, but it's still strong and still swirling around Grog as Grog's trying to find a way to get a bead on it so he can smack it with the hammer.
Liam: Okay. And I see that Grog is in pretty good hands with Kerrek, so I'm going to use my movement, which is hasted, to slide around this way and crouch ten feet in front of Keyleth. There.
Patrick rothfuss: I think that's Keyleth you're moving. Oh no, I'm sorry.
Liam: Ahead of Keyleth. Between Raishan and her.
Matt: Right there?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Cool. All right. Vex, you're up.
Sam: We're just in a nice line.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to-- I saw Keyleth say that she was in fog, so can I come around that corner and see her?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: Come on, come on, dragon sense and shit.
Liam: Smell that dragon.
Liam: Yeah!
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: 31.
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: You can see within the fog, as difficult as it is, a winged form swirling in there. So you can make your attacks, it's still at a disadvantage because it's invisible, but you can actually attack her right now, yes.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to attack her, and I'm going to try to do Bramble Shot.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: With the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay. Before you do that, you still have Hunter's Mark up.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Matt: It's concentration.
Laura: Okay-- Bramble Shot isn't concentration, though. Can I shift it over to her?
Matt: You can, technically, yeah.
Travis: Didn't your Hunter's Mark just disappear because she wasn't there?
Laura: No, no, it was up.
Matt: It's still up. It's concentration, you just have to choose another target, use your bonus action to shift it over.
Marisha: Because the illusion isn't considered a target?
Laura: So once I-- it's like up. So once I knew where she was I could shift it.
Liam: So sorry, since I'm new with Hunter's Mark, later I can take my floating Hunter's Mark and bring it over to Raishan?
Matt: Eventually, once you have a bead on where she is, yes.
Liam: Sweet.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So now you can take your attack. Go for it.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies, come on.
Liam: That's good.
Laura: Okay, that's good, that's a-- what is that? 30. Or something.
Liam: 32.
Laura: 32.
Matt: Rolling with disadvantage, right?
Laura: That was-- okay, that's--
Liam: That's okay.
Laura: 26?
Matt: 26, uh. 26 hits, yeah.
Laura: Okay. So that's a Bramble Shot.
Travis: Just hits, or hits?
Matt: It hits.
Laura: Bramble Shot with the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll damage. And then let me know what the saving throw is.
Laura: Oh, wait. Let me (Scottish accent) get my d8s out here.
Sam: Wow, good Indian accent.
Laura: Thank you. (all laugh)
Travis: She was at 24 last time.
Laura: 28 plus two lightning damage plus... six for Hunter's Mark.
Travis: 34.
Laura: 34. Plus the blazing bowstring is nine. So 43.
Travis: 43.
Laura: Points of damage.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And then she has to do a strength saving throw of--
Matt: Well, first a concentration check. She succeeds, yeah, okay. And then what's the--
Laura: And then a strength saving throw.
Matt: That is a nine.
Laura: Oh, so she's restrained!
Matt: She is.
Marisha: Shut up! Shut up.
Sam: She's still invisible, though. She's still invisible, we can't see her.
Marisha: You badass!
Laura: But she's restrained in the fog.
Marisha: You badass!
Matt: You hear a (growl and impact). (All yell and cheer.)
Matt: You watch as some of the fog billows out. You can still vaguely make out the form, as she (struggling sounds).
Laura: All right. I'm going to pull out a sleep arrow and do my second attack with a sleep arrow through the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Invisible gives you disadvantage, but because she is currently restrained, that gives you advantage, so it's just a straight roll.
Laura: Just straight? 26.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: You will be a golden god if this works.
Laura: 14 plus one lightning plus two for sneak attack... so four more. And then, oh, and then a sleep arrow.
Matt: What's the total damage?
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18.
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Thanks, you math genius, you.
Marisha: Do those arrows work like the spell?
Matt: She maintains concentration. So for the purposes of the spell...
Travis: (heavy breathing)
Marisha: I know, I know.
Matt: Roll 5d8.
Laura: 5d8?
Marisha: Oh, I think you have to beat her hit points.
Liam: Higher than her hit points, yeah.
Matt: Yep.
Liam: Well, that's--
Marisha: That's going to be tough.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: But she's diseased. And whatnot.
Travis: She got that Hep C, y'all. (all laugh)
Laura: 18?
Matt: 18.
Liam: No way.
Matt: You fire the arrow, but you still hear thrashing about.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: It does not seem to be--
Laura: Well, it was worth a try.
Taliesin: It was valiant.
Matt: All right. That ends--
Laura: Oh, and then I'm going to use the rest of my move to duck around that corner and back up.
Matt: Duck around this corner here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: That's as far as you can get right there.
Laura: I want to be behind that stalactite or whatever--
Matt: There?
Laura: Yeah. Mite. Stalagmite.
Matt: Yeah, like mite.
Liam: You might what?
Matt: All right, cool.
Laura: I might hide behind that stalagmite.
Matt: That ends your turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Did I see this go down?
Matt: You're over here watching the egg off in the distance, and you watch her fire a couple arrows and then rush around the corner, and you hear the slam into the ground. Though you can see the fog moving around and there's thrashing. If you wanted to try and attack something, you'd have to roll a perception check.
Taliesin: All right. I'm making my way along the wall anyway in that direction, so while I'm walking I'm going to see if anything looks worth shooting at over there.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: Perception check. Hey! Let's call that a 25.
Matt: 25, you can just make out the outline of a form thrashing within the fog cloud, so yes, I would allow you to take attacks, with disadvantage.
Taliesin: I'm going to cast Hex.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And she now has disadvantage on strength saving throws.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Patrick rothfuss: (laughs) Nice.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm being a dick.
Marisha: Strength saving throws, hell yeah.
Taliesin: So I'm going to burn a grit to cancel out the disadvantage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Better mark that like a clever person. And I'm just going to try and take a shot and see what happens.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: So this is with Bad News. That's a 21.
Matt: 21? Vanishes into the mist. Does not seem to have made an impact.
Travis: I think it's 23.
Laura: Really?
Taliesin: One more shot. Oh, yeah. 29.
Matt: 29 does hit. That's with disadvantage?
Taliesin: Yeah. No, that's with a grit to cancel out the disadvantage.
Matt: Oh, gotcha. Then yeah, that does hit.
Taliesin: So, okay, I'm going to use that, since it hit I'm also going to shove all six of my charges through that shot as well.
Matt: Okay, then.
Taliesin: For fun.
Patrick rothfuss: Actually, does he have disadvantage because she's bound? Didn't those cancel out when she attacked?
Laura: She's invisible, though.
Patrick rothfuss: Invisible but restrained.
Matt: Right, so you would've had... so it would've been just a straight attack.
Liam: So you don't need the grit.
Laura: So you don't need to burn the grit, that's great.
Taliesin: I'll get that back later, okay.
Matt: Good call, thank you.
Taliesin: So. Thank you, thank you, that's going to make life better later. So that's--
Matt: Just roll damage and then pump 6d6 lightning damage from your cloak into the hit.
Laura: Holy moly!
Taliesin: So that's-- oh god, I got to get more dice, I didn't even think this through.
Marisha: Do you need d6s? I've got a line.
Taliesin: Sure.
Marisha: Here's some d6s.
Taliesin: I just need three more.
Marisha: One two-three.
Travis: Here's all of them.
Marisha: Here's all of them.
Taliesin: So 6d6 plus... d12s plus... one more 1d6 because there's some necro there.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Thank you. Okay. That'll do. Here we go.
Liam: Necro.
Taliesin: Oh wow. Okay. I'm going to make that the necro because that's fun.
Marisha: That's hot!
Taliesin: Yeah, that's pretty good. I wish I had your power to do that crazy. All right, let's see how we did.
Laura: C'mon Percival!
Taliesin: That's... hahaha. (all laugh)
Travis: The most random line-fillers.
Taliesin: 23 points of normal damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: 23 points of normal damage, six points of necrotic damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And 25 points of lightning damage.
Matt: Nice, that's a total of 54 points of damage.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, that felt good.
Matt: She still makes her save for her maintaining concentration.
Taliesin: Wow, all right.
Marisha: How?
Matt: Dragons have really high constitution.
Taliesin: I'm going to keep moving my maximum move in that direction along the wall.
Matt: Dragons have high constitution. It's plus 14 modifier.
Taliesin: If I can move any further I will, but that's--
Matt: You can move, from where you were? No, that's as far as you can go, unfortunately, yeah.
Taliesin: That's fine. I just call over the headpiece, "She's down and vulnerable!"
Matt: All right. As you finish your turn, you watch as the fog shifts and you hear (footsteps) and a voice retorts out, "Not as down and not as vulnerable as you think."
Taliesin: Oh, shit.
Matt: Backs up into the fog.
Marisha: Oh, jeez.
Matt: You just barely see, Scanlan, as it steps away, this form vanish into-- well, you said you were holding your action for something?
Sam: I was not holding my action. I thought about it.
Matt: That's right, that's right. So you watch the figure back away into the fog ever-so-slightly going (soft chanting).
Laura: She's casting something.
Taliesin: Did she-- even with disadvantage on her strength check on that one?
Matt: Hm? Well, she can't move anywhere, because she's restrained.
Laura: Oh, she is still restrained?
Matt: Correct. She can't move.
Marisha: She's switching form?
Laura: Oh.
Sam: She's still restrained?
Matt: She's still restrained. For the item, what does it say? Is it a saving throw at the end of the turn, or is it has to use an action to break free?
Laura: Let me find out, because let's see. You wrote it, I mean.
Matt: I know, but I haven't looked at it in a while.
Laura: The restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
Matt: Okay, cool. So. So yes.
Laura: Oh, and it's a DC of 17. Not 16. I have it written down wrong.
Matt: Okay, that's fine, she still rolled poorly for that one. As the face pulls back into the mist, you feel this shaking within the room as the ceilings of the cavern begin to shift and form into what appear to be small rifts.
Sam: Oh shit. What's all that?
Travis: The air conditioning?
Sam: Yeah, that's what it is. Central.
Marisha: HVAC.
Laura: Oh no. Oh no!
Matt: You hear the sound of rocketing stone and flame being pulled from a realm or plane beyond the material--
Marisha: She's doing a Meteor Swarm. She's doing a Meteor Swarm!
Liam: Final Fantasy.
Laura: There's nowhere to take cover, is there?
Marisha: Hold onto your butts.
Laura: Hold onto your knickers!
Matt: One... two...
Marisha: Yeah, that's fair.
Matt: Actually, it would be two... three... four. All of you.
Taliesin: Four?
Marisha: One day, I'll have that spell.
Taliesin: Four?
Laura: Scanlan even got hit? Scanlan got hit in there?
Sam: I was on the edge of one of them.
Laura: Ah, balls.
Matt: Yep, everybody got hit. So. I need everybody... Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw, please.
Travis: Nobody can counter that or anything, hey?
Liam: Natural 20!
Patrick rothfuss: Grog, you get a plus three from me.
Travis: Oh, nice.
Patrick rothfuss: Who else is next to me there? Is she close enough to be within my aura?
Matt: Who, Kima?
Patrick rothfuss: Yes.
Matt: Kima has her own aura, thankfully.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: She's a paladin as well.
Patrick rothfuss: Am I close enough to get hers?
Matt: So it's ten feet, you guys are not close enough to affect each other, no. So you do not get to receive each other's bonus, unfortunately. All right. So. Scanlan.
Sam: Eight.
Matt: (laughs) Eight. Okay. You suffer... that's 118 points of damage. (Incredulous laughter.)
Matt: Bludgeoning--
Sam: I'm immune to meteors. (all laugh)
Matt: It's 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage, and half as much on half. So yeah, so that's 118 points--
Sam: Tell me this  do I have-- how many hit points do I have, because when she dispelled the Hero's Feast, do I lose those temporary hit points?
Matt: You do.
Sam: Okay. So... got it.
Marisha: So you're unconscious, aren't you?
Sam: No.
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No?
Matt: He's a hardy little gnome, man.
Laura: Wow, that's impressive.
Matt: Percy.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18. You suffer 118 points of damage.
Taliesin: 19, I'm sorry, 19.
Matt: Still suffer it.
Taliesin: Okay. That's fine. 118.
Sam: When she dispelled things, did I also lose my Pike advantages things?
Laura: The Beacon of Hope?
Sam: Beacon of Hope?
Laura: Or was it just the one?
Matt: No. No, the only thing she dispelled was a single specific effect, which was the Hero's Feast.
Marisha: So you have to pick an effect.
Sam: So you have to tell what you're dispelling? Okay.
Matt: You have to pick a singular effect.
Marisha: Okay. That's good.
Matt: Yeah. And Raishan is well aware that you guys prepare with a Hero's Feast.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Keyleth.
Marisha: 24.
Matt: 24. You suffer 59 points of damage.
Marisha: Okay, that's half. That's half. Nothing better. Don't you guys wish you were me?
Travis: Well, yeah, yes.
Taliesin: Really, we do. That's genuinely a thing.
Marisha: 54? 59?
Matt: 59 points.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm alive. Nice.
Matt: Oof.
Laura: This is like instant run away (laughs). One spell she does.
Matt: Kima is already down, unconscious.
Laura: No, Kima!
Matt: Sorry, Allura is down, Kima is still up.
Patrick rothfuss: Christ.
Marisha: I'm at 57 hit points.
Matt: Kerrek.
Travis: She started to cast.
Patrick rothfuss: Just no, not even close.
Laura: That's right, wasn't she saving her action?
Travis: Allura, wasn't she preparing Disintegrate?
Sam: Yeah, until she saw something.
Matt: She never saw something come through. So that--
Sam: Is that like a hand-grenade where you fall and--
Travis: And it goes ting-ting-ting (explosion).
Matt: Not so much.
Laura: I'm disintegrated.
Patrick rothfuss: Six.
Matt: Six. Kerrek, you suffer 118 points of damage.
Patrick rothfuss: Yes I do.
Sam: What's he down--
Matt: Kerrek is unconscious.
Patrick rothfuss: I am unconscious.
Sam: I mean, how far down?
Liam: There is no negative, he's just down.
Laura: No, no, it's not like that.
Sam: It's not like past--
Liam: You have to surpass your total--
Sam: I know, that's what I'm asking.
Patrick rothfuss: I'm not that bad, not that bad.
Taliesin: The world's cruel.
Matt: All right. Next up is--
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: So zero damage to Vax.
Liam: Hip hop hippity hop.
Laura: 22.
Patrick rothfuss: You have Evasion?
Liam: Yep.
Matt: 22, you suffer 59 points of damage.
Patrick rothfuss: I got so used to playing a rogue, nothing can stick on you.
Matt: The DC is 22 for the spell.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: 22, wow.
Laura: Trinket got three. But he is, he is resistant to magical bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: Or bludgeoning damage, rather.
Taliesin: Wait a minute. Is this magical damage?
Matt: Yes?
Taliesin: Does Cabal's absorb it?
Matt: What's it say for Cabal?
Marisha: Oh, come on.
Taliesin: You keep going, I'll let you know, I'm going to read.
Sam: You have advantage.
Matt: So Trinket takes...
Liam: A skillion hit points.
Matt: So Trinket failed the save, Trinket would actually take 85 points of damage.
Laura: Oh, he's unconscious and in my necklace. Good job, Trinket. He was within 100 feet of me, right?
Matt: Yes, he was. He was over here.
Laura: I'm glad I moved back. (gasps) Would he have been further than 100 feet if I hadn't moved back?
Matt: No, he'd have to be pretty far to be further than 100 feet from you.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Grog?
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. You take 118 points of damage.
Travis: Now, is it-- do I halve the bludgeoning because of raging?
Matt: You know what? I believe you do, yes. So you actually suffer the same, eighty--
Laura: 85, you said.
Matt: 85.
Laura: Okay, and Pike got a nine.
Sam: This is the big one.
Matt: Pike takes 118 points of damage.
Laura: But she's fire resistant.
Matt: Right, so that's true. So she takes 87 points of damage.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: She still up?
Laura: She's still up.
Taliesin: I'll wait until you guys are done. I'll wait until they're done and then I'll pop in with my reaction.
Travis: That's the single most powerful attack we've ever had hit, right?
Patrick rothfuss: Actually, I'm really glad to hear that, because if I'm going to go out--
Travis: You might as well go out with the ace, man.
Taliesin: Literally in a hail of bullets.
Travis: That had some stank on it.
Taliesin: I'm going to activate-- I'm going to use my reaction to activate Cabal's Ruin. I'm going to absorb the spell and the damage I take is halved and the cloak gains the number of charges equal to the spell's level, the level of the triggering shot.
Matt: Yes, it does.
Laura: Wow, that is a clutch--
Liam: Yeah, Perce!
Laura: That is major.
Matt: Which, it's a ninth-level spell.
Taliesin: Yeah, I don't get all nine, do I, because-- does the spell hold nine charges?
Matt: The cloak holds six charges. However, as you absorb the spell, the cloak flares out and actually grows an additional six inches in length. The inside begins to sparkle with electric energy as it pulls one of the meteors into the cloak itself. It arcs inward and vanishes into the side. It bursts behind you, and the damage is taken, but the cloak now is shimmering with a very vibrant but continuous spark of arcane energy.
Laura: My eyes are like--
Sam: It awoke, it awoke!
Matt: Pass this over, please.
Laura: You got upgraded! (All sing.)
Taliesin: Oh shit. What! Okay, so.
Sam: 'Exalted', it says. Not just awoken. Exalted.
Marisha: It has ten charges in it.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm so jealous! What do I do?
Taliesin: So I'm at nine, the damage is still halved?
Laura: What if I die without upgrading my bow?
Matt: The damage is still halved, yeah. So you took a total of 59 points of damage.
Taliesin: 59 points of damage, okay. So I'm going to add 59 hitpoints to that.
Liam: De Rolo just went full peacock. He suddenly has a giant cowboy hat on.
Sam: It says anyone who wears the exalted Cabal's Ruin has permanently oiled skin. (all laugh)
Matt: It's a full paragraph descriptor of it on the actual item.
Taliesin: I'm back at 81 points, so that's nice. And I have nine charges in the cloak.
Matt: Yes you do.
Taliesin: Okay, that's awesome.
Sam: You should've used that shit.
Taliesin: It's never come up.
Matt: All right. Now, Raishan, trying-- so by the way, I don't think it's possible for you to have spells up to even make the concentration saving throw on this, because of the sheer amount of damage you took. Make a concentration saving throw, Percy? Yeah, Kima lost hers.
Sam: Did Pike lose hers?
Matt: Pike-- roll a constitution saving throw for Pike.
Marisha: You have to do over the damage you did.
Taliesin: That's 16 is my concentration save.
Matt: Yeah, so your--
Taliesin: My Hex--
Matt: Your Hex is gone.
Liam: Am I good with my Hunter's Mark?
Matt: You didn't take any damage, so you're fine.
Taliesin: I was busy.
Laura: You're fine, you're fucking fine. I can't believe you haven't taken any damage.
Matt: You haven't tagged her with it yet, but you've still got it up.
Laura: I mean, you'd better save all of us when we all die when you're flying around like--
Liam: Our relationship is very complicated.
Laura: I guess just like walking around.
Matt: What was Pike's saving throw?
Laura: No, she didn't make it, she got five.
Matt: All right, so yeah, her spell is gone as well.
Laura: Great.
Matt: And Vex, I need you to make your concentration saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh shit, okay.
Matt: Constitution.
Laura: Nope.
Matt: Lose your Hunter's Mark as well. All righty.
Travis: Yeah, get rid of that one now.
Matt: And Raishan's going to make a strength saving throw--
Sam: Ooh. Ooh.
Matt: That is a 19, so she is no longer restrained.
Marisha: Fucking fuck.
Sam: Did the dog get hit?
Matt: Oh, the dog got hit.
Travis: No! Not McGruff!
Matt: As the impact hits you and you're like--
Sam: Can I roll for the dog?
Matt: It won't even matter.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: He is smoked.
Matt: The dog takes enough damage to immediately revert back to the onyx figure that it was, but the impact sends it careening through the room like a pinball.
Sam: Every time we use this dog that's what happens.
Patrick rothfuss: Imagine his life. (all laugh)
Patrick rothfuss: Just moments of like-- (explosions)
Travis: How's it going? (barking, explosion)
Sam: I think we've only brought him out twice and he's been blown up both times.
Laura: He's been exploded, yeah. It's so sad.
Patrick rothfuss: It's worse if you imagine how a dog always greets you when you come home.
Laura: He's just so happy.
Patrick rothfuss: Imagine-- that's how he comes out, it's like, hey! Hey!
Marisha: I'm so happy to see you!
Matt: (explosion)
Laura: No, he's a bit of a snooty dog, actually.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, okay.
Taliesin: Kind of a snooty dog.
Liam: We need a scene with the dog and Trinket commiserating over a bowl of--
Travis: Earl Grey.
Liam: Constantly getting blasted up.
Marisha: Kibbles and bits for you too?
Matt: All righty. So, ending Raishan's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Oh man, that smarted.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Um. Okay, is Kerrek around me?
Matt: Kerrek is way back here, so he's about 100 feet from you.
Sam: 100 feet.
Matt: Yes, roughly.
Patrick rothfuss: There's a paladin over there that'll probably-- hopefully--
Sam: Well, I can't reach you anyway, so.
Matt: Allura's down, and everyone around you is pretty--
Sam: Oh, can I see Allura from where I am?
Matt: Allura is right over here, so yeah, you can see Allura.
Marisha: So the only people who've gone down are Allura and Kerrek?
Matt: Kerrek. Everyone else seems to still be standing.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Barely, but standing.
Taliesin: The wraiths didn't take any damage, did they?
Matt: The one wraith that was there... yes, actually, that wraith was destroyed. Thank you for the reminder.
Taliesin: Silver lining.
Marisha: Silver lining.
Travis: Second one is still there, right?
Laura: The other one was--
Matt: The other one just got destroyed by the Meteor Swarm.
Laura: And Thordak is just even more watermelon.
Matt: Yeah. It is just-- the room already had old carnage on it, now it has new carnage.
Taliesin: Fresh paint.
Matt: It looks kind of like the Butcher in Diablo I, when you get to his room and it's just covered.
Liam: It's everything he deserves.
Matt: All right. So, Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: I'm going to heal Allura.
Matt: Okay, you'll have to get a little closer if you're doing-- is it 30 or 60 feet for your--
Sam: It's 30.
Matt: 30? So you'll have to be a little closer.
Sam: Well then, I'll walk that way as much as I can, actually.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Yeah, right there.
Matt: As you pull back--
Marisha: What? No!
Taliesin: No.
Sam: Sure.
Travis: High five? High five me, bro?
Matt: Yeah, high five you with the claw. Raishan takes an attack of opportunity on you, her invisible form right at the edge of that fog cloud. Oh, that is a 15.
Sam: Yeah, that hits. Unless I Cutting Words it.
Matt: That's up to you.
Marisha: Yeah yeah yeah! Do the thing, do the thing.
Sam: Shit. I'll Cutting Words it. Sorry, Allura. Oh wait, no, that's not a bonus action--
Matt: That's your reaction.
Sam: --that's a reaction. So yes, I will Cutting Words. I will yell at the claw I see coming out of the cloud of smoke, I will say, "You're so dumb, you get your yearly checkup from Dr. Dranzel." (Weak laughter.)
Matt: Roll a d12.
Travis: That was like some six-week-old orange juice.
Sam: Two.
Matt: That reduces it to 13.
Sam: That does not hit.
Matt: So you hear this voice go, "Wait, who?" (all laugh)
Matt: From the fog, and this wisp of wind just misses you A claw just catches the back of a hair. But yeah, you move fine and you are within range now.
Sam: Jesus Christ. Okay, so I will do a Healing Word on Allura.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I will sing to her, (singing) "Scanlan singing in the dead of night, take your broken bones and learn to fly" That's all I got.
Marisha: I love that song.
Matt: (singing) "You were only waiting to get up and cast a spell."
Sam: Yes! Do I roll?
Matt: Yes, you roll for that.
Sam: Yes. d4, right?
Matt: d4 plus six.
Sam: Four! That's ten!
Matt: All right. She is at ten hit points. Conscious.
Sam: Double-dig.
Matt: Allura now (gasps). "Oh dear."
Laura: I look down at her like--
Matt: (nervous laugh)
Sam: I will also boopadeeboopboop (raspberry sounds). Yeah. So I still have an action, right?
Matt: You do.
Sam: And when I saw the form rise up in the cloud, it did not move away, it just rose up.
Matt: Correct, yeah. It was right at the cusp of the fog.
Sam: So I have a vicinity. I saw a claw, I saw something like--
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Sam: I can take a shot.
Matt: If you want to.
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to take a shot.
Matt: What're you doing?
Sam: I am going to cast-- let's do Bigby's Hand at level six.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah, dude. Yeah!
Sam: Sure.
Travis: Commitment.
Matt: Right at the outside of the radius? Where the dragon is?
Sam: I mean, it's probably got to punch into the cloud a little bit to get--
Matt: Yeah, but it's right, it's right at the cusp of where you saw the dragon's form moving.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. And so at level six? So for that-- and you're using the punching?
Sam: Yes, please.
Matt: All righty. So go ahead and roll a d20, adding your spell attack modifier.
Sam: That was a cocked roll, but I'll take it, because I'm a man of honor, and it did not work. 13.
Matt: 13, no, that misses.
Travis: Was it cocked?
Laura: But if it was cocked, then it doesn't count.
Sam: Didn't actually roll. It hit the side of my box.
Matt: It's still a roll, it's fine. So the fist-- whoosh-- into the fog, just manages to move past the form, does not actually hit the side of it.
Sam: Balls. All right.
Matt: Does not hit balls either. But Bigby's fist is up and around.
Sam: Okay, good.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, what about the radiant weapon, did that-- was that a concentration spell?
Laura: It was.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh.
Laura: Oh wait, no, it's not a concentration. No.
Matt: Yeah, that's still around.
Laura: Spiritual Weapon's still up?
Matt: When it comes to Pike's turn, Pike can still do that.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Good looking out.
Travis: (singing) Stay alive...
Matt: That's going to be the end of your turn. Raishan is going to use two legendary actions to--
Taliesin: Burn 'em, baby.
Marisha: How many does she have?
Taliesin: Too many.
Matt: Four per turn.
Marisha: Four per turn? Jeez.
Matt: Is going to go ahead and cast Disintegrate at Pike.
Laura: What? Disintegrate? What'd he say?
Liam: Disintegrate toward Pike.
Laura: No!
Taliesin: No.
Laura: No.
Sam: Is that bad?
Laura: Please tell me that's a natural one that you just rolled and you're taking a picture of it.
Marisha: I know, right? Yeah.
Matt: I'm taking a picture of it right now.
Travis: Throw the laser pointer over here.
Taliesin: He somehow rolled a 46 and they're trying to figure out what to do about it.
Travis: Laser pointer!
Taliesin: Laser pointer?
Liam: Pass it.
Taliesin: Okay, fine.
Matt: I'm checking to make sure this is how the spell works.
Travis: Blind him. Blind him!
Matt: This is going to be really funny. Don't blind me, I'm trying to help.
Travis: Take the shot!
Taliesin: I have the shot.
Matt: Oh, has to make a dexterity saving throw, so that roll wouldn't matter. I rolled a one, but it doesn't matter because it's not an attack. Dexterity saving throw on Pike, please.
Liam: Fuck.
Laura: I don't want to roll it, it's too much pressure.
Marisha: Can we just pretend that one was like a nat 20 for Pike?
Liam: I'll roll it, one of us has to roll it. Here's what it is, this is what it is. It's a 14.
Laura: 14?
Matt: Total 14? That's not enough.
Patrick rothfuss: Is she by anyone with the paladin radius? We got a bunch of pallies here.
Laura: She's not by any of the paladins.
Matt: Uh, you know what? Actually, Allura is conscious on the ground. Allura is going to attempt to counterspell that. That is a sixth-level spell. 'Cause Allura's going to try and get that out at the last minute. So.
Laura: With Disintegrate, does the body go away? I don't understand.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah, it ain't good.
Taliesin: Will the armor retort that or no?
Sam: Yeah, the armor brings her back to one point, doesn't it?
Matt: Okay, fourth or higher... DC equals 10 plus the spell level. Allura's spell modifier is five, so-- That is an eight. That's not enough. She rolled an eight plus five, that's not enough to counter the spell. Okay, so that goes to... Pike suffers, so that's 72 points of force damage.
Laura: Well, she's knocked unconscious, but the armor should bring her back.
Matt: Pike, as the beam hits her, you watch her flesh begin to turn to dust as the fingers begin to disperse... as a burst of flame from the armor flares outward, bringing her back to her feet at whatever the effect of the armor is, so she gets up.
Sam: Is it five?
Liam: She gets like one hit point, I think.
Travis: What's the effect of the armor?
Laura: The effect of the armor--
Liam: She's up, she's up. She's not dead.
Laura: Brings her back to five hit points.
Matt: I had forgotten she had that.
Laura: And she's on her feet.
Matt: So she's on her feet.
Laura: Is-- no, Raishan's not within 15 feet of her, is she?
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Okay, she's not dust.
Matt: She's not dust. Okay. That brings us to--
Sam: (laughs) Oh, Jesus.
Laura: I can't, if Ashley's not here, you can't kill her when she's not here.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Sam: She's not dead, she's walking around.
Matt: She's not-- I'm acting like she would!
Marisha: That would be the worst fucking phone call, Matt.
Matt: I know!
Laura: If Ashley dies when she's not here--
Matt: She's also the cleric, that's exactly what Raishan would do! Grog, you're up.
Travis: I take out the cask of ale and I start drinking. (all laugh)
Travis: No. Now that I don't have any more wraiths, I'm going to run towards this wall if I can. This one.
Matt: This one over here?
Travis: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 50 feet, and I'll leap the rest, just to get up to the--
Matt: That's as far as you can get, there.
Travis: Yeah. And that is--
Matt: So go ahead and roll your athletics check to leap.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Yeah, that's fine. So you can leap 20 feet. Yeah, Mr. Badger, you're gone, you are scattered. All righty.
Travis: Oh, I can throw!
Matt: Well, you have to roll a perception check to see if you can see the invisible form in there.
Travis: Oh, this'll go well.
Laura: Natural 20.
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Damn.
Sam: Oh, when Bigby's Hand went at rest, it just started to just-- yeah.
Matt: Just pointing. (all laugh)
Matt: Here! Perfect.
Travis: That is a 16.
Matt: Okay. I'll say between that roll and the Bigby's Hand pointing at where the dragon is, I'll let you make your attacks, but they're at disadvantage.
Travis: Awesome. Well, I'll make 'em Reckless, so I'll zero them out. Can I throw the dwarven thrower?
Matt: Yes you can.
Travis: Okay. One roll. 21.
Matt: Nope. The hammer just disappears into the fog and returns back to your grasp.
Travis: That's better. 31.
Matt: That does hit.
Travis: 18 points of damage.
Matt: 18 points of damage?
Travis: Oh, thrown.
Matt: Yeah, plus the--
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20. Okay. Constitution saving throw, yeah, makes the concentration one. Are you Frenzied or not?
Travis: I would like to go into a Frenzied Rage.
Matt: Yeah, Frenzied Rage, so make your bonus attack strike now.
Sam: Was that a saving throw?
Matt: Yeah, it has to maintain concentration on Greater Invisibility every time it takes damage.
Sam: Technically, disadvantage because of Cutting Words.
Matt: That's true. And that would be a 19. Still makes it, yeah.
Sam: Damn.
Matt: It needs to make more damage.
Travis: 28.
Matt: 28 damage.
Travis: No, no, 28 to hit on the third throw.
Matt: Oh, that does hit, yeah.
Travis: 22 points of damage.
Matt: 22. Saving throw. Yeah, it succeeds, so it maintains invisibility. All right. Ending your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, it does.
Patrick rothfuss: Does the Cutting Word-- how long does that last?
Sam: Just the next saving throw.
Patrick rothfuss: The next saving throw.
Sam: That's it.
Patrick rothfuss: That's cool.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Words are mean, man.
Patrick rothfuss: Words hurt.
Sam: Well, that's not from words, that's from the sword.
Taliesin: That's the sword?
Sam: From my Mythcarver.
Taliesin: Oh, shit.
Matt: At the end of your turn, Grog, she's going to use her other two legendary actions here to go ahead and cast Cone of Cold.
Travis: Not that shit again, I didn't do well on that last time.
Sam: Cone of Cold? Again. I die.
Matt: So that's everybody there. I need Scanlan, Vex, Pike, Vax, Grog, and Keyleth, and Allura, to all make constitution saving throws. Constitution, yes.
Travis: (nervous laughter)
Patrick rothfuss: Not with your plus nine?
Travis: No no no.
Matt: Keyleth?
Marisha: 13.
Matt: 13. You take 42 points of cold damage.
Travis: How much?
Matt: 42.
Travis: Cool.
Marisha: Is that the full damage, or did I--
Matt: That's the full damage.
Taliesin: You're up.
Marisha: I'm walking.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: 16.
Matt: 16, you take 42 points of cold damage. Vex?
Laura: 12.
Matt: 12, you take 42 points of cold damage.
Travis: Seven.
Patrick rothfuss: Don't you have Evasion?
Liam: It's a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Am I in there?
Matt: You are as well. What'd you roll?
Sam: 15.
Matt: 42 points of cold damage.
Laura: 20 for Pike.
Matt: Pike takes 42 points of cold damage.
Sam: Shit.
Matt: So Pike is unconscious. Who else is unconscious?
Sam: I am unconscious.
Marisha: Fuck.
Matt: You are unconscious. Bigby's Hand is gone.
Travis: Grab that popcorn, this movie's interesting.
Taliesin: Nothing I have is useful.
Sam: (belches) Oh, I forgot we're on TV. (all laugh)
Laura: What did you do? Did you just burp really gross?
Sam: Burped, yeah.
Matt: Allura is unconscious again.
Marisha: This isn't TV, this is the internet.
Travis: At least people can't smell it.
Marisha: The wild west.
Matt: So Allura's unconscious, Vex, you still up?
Laura: I'm still up.
Marisha: Allura's down again?
Laura: Yep.
Matt: Allura's down again, yeah, she got hit.
Laura: Pike's down.
Matt: Pike's down.
Marisha: Fucking--
Matt: All right. That is all of her legendary actions this turn. Ending Grog's turn, all righty. That brings us to Kerrek. I need you to go ahead and roll a death saving throw.
Patrick rothfuss: I've been down this road before.
Travis: (said extremely quickly) Don't you get advantage on those death saving throws?
Patrick rothfuss: (laughs) What was that?
Matt: Unfortunately, the spell that did that faded.
Sam: I think he's auctioning something over there.
Travis: (auctioneer's babble)
Patrick rothfuss: Now, is that just a straight-up--
Liam: Straight roll.
Matt: Just a straight d20.
Liam: Seven.
Patrick rothfuss: Straight d20. Seven.
Matt: So that's one fail. So you've failed one death saving throw.
Patrick rothfuss: Well, you could call that a failure... it really depends on what I'm trying to accomplish here.
Marisha: Don't call it a comeback.
Sam: In the Hindu faith, you would welcome it.
Patrick rothfuss: Yes, you know. If what I'm trying to accomplish is a lot of drama, I consider that a great success in a roll.
Matt: All right, so Kima, as it's now Kima's turn, sees you on the ground, convulsing from the blast of the impact, the giant crater in the ground where the meteors struck, and hearing these blasts of arcane energy around the other side, she has practically no vision of what's happening right now. All she sees is you down, and Grog run off, and she says, "C'mon, my bearded friend." Runs up and is going to go ahead and hit you with Lay on Hands for... let's see, for Kima she can do up to-- she's going to give you 30 hit points.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, that's nice.
Matt: As you come to consciousness, you see the scarred halfling paladin in her golden armor and half-cocked grin. "Come on, we still have work to do." Puts her hand down to try and lift you up.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of the fun of it, bonus action pulls you to your feet.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, thank you.
Matt: All righty. That ends Kima's turn.
Travis: Shit.
Matt: Allura has to make a death saving throw.
Travis: No!
Matt: With a seven, that is a failure.
Travis: Fuck!
Marisha: Fuck!
Matt: She loses a death saving throw. That brings us to Pike. Pike I need to make roll a death saving throw.
Liam: Do you want to do it? I'll do it.
Travis: I could do it.
Liam: Go for it.
Travis: It's a five.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: Pike fails a death saving throw.
Laura: Okay. Okay. Nobody else just willy-nilly make some rolls, okay.
Matt: Keyleth, it's your turn.
Marisha: (nervous laughter) That's nice.
Sam: Do I need to make a death saving throw? No.
Matt: When it gets to your turn, you do.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: New campaign next week. (all laugh)
Marisha: Shut your fucking face right fucking now. Fuck me. Okay.
Travis: Who's got the This Is A Bad Dream spell?
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: The Dallas? I don't have a Dallas left.
Matt: There is a spell for that. It's called Wish.
Laura: Do we have any wishes?
Sam: Don't move, just heal.
Marisha: Laser pointer, laser pointer. Just shut up, laser pointer.
Matt: You going to try and draw a card?
Taliesin: Travis.
Marisha: Anybody laser pointer!
Travis: Oh, sorry. (Impressed noises.)
Matt: That's my girl.
Marisha: Who's-- shhh-- who's that?
Matt: That is the water fountain. (all laugh)
Marisha: All right, fuck that water fountain! All right.
Taliesin: I've been wondering this whole time.
Travis: Who's that? It's a fountain.
Marisha: Who's that?
Taliesin: It was very lifelike.
Marisha: Okay. Keyleth is very not okay, comes around the corner, and I'm going to do, with my staff, and I'm going to pray to Melora and be like, "I know you hate this bitch as much as I do," and use my staff to do Firestorm right where I know she is.
Matt: Over here? All righty.
Marisha: Just boof-boof-boof-boof--
Matt: Sure.
Sam: What's the radius?
Marisha: I get to pick.
Sam: Oh, thank god.
Matt: So you send fire sneaking all through there--
Marisha: All of that, all through this area, just that whole tunnel gets lit up.
Matt: I'll say for the purposes of the Fog spell versus a seventh-level fire spell and the item, the fog cloud is just burned off, it is done, it is gone. All right, so roll that 7d10 fire damage. Saving throw... that is a failed save. She will use her first legendary resistance.
Laura: First?
Marisha: First?
Matt: To ignore that.
Taliesin: Burn 'em up.
Marisha: 7d10?
Matt: 7d10 fire damage.
Marisha: Five... do you have two more?
Taliesin: I do.
Laura: Did she gain them all back? Did she heal all the way? I mean, what's going on?
Matt: Yeah, she rested, she got 'em all back. You guys rested a whole night to get your shit back, so did she.
Laura: Well, fine.
Matt: It's like enemies can do that too.
Laura: That's stupid.
Matt: Don't forget your staff's ability--
Marisha: Reroll ones!
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: Which I have one that I will reroll, and it's a one. Do I get to reroll it again?
Matt: So you get to reroll it, yeah.
Marisha: Fuck yeah.
Taliesin: There are no ones here.
Marisha: That's better.
Taliesin: That's much better.
Marisha: Nine... 12...
Laura: I like how red your face is getting.
Marisha: Is it? Am I hot? I'm pale. I'm a redhead, so I show everything that happens. It's true. 17...
Sam: I don't think that came out right.
Marisha: Don't worry about it. I'm distracted. God damn it. Now I'm distracted out of my math. 17 plus four is 21, correct? Plus another five is 26 plus another four is 30, plus another four is 34. 34 damage.
Matt: 34 damage. 17 points of fire damage.
Marisha: Did you get hit?
Sam: No, that's half of 34.
Taliesin: No, that's half.
Marisha: Oh, that's right. She saved.
Matt: So yeah, it succeeds.
Marisha: Does it being a staff of Melora do anything?
Matt: No, other than the mention of the name caused the sound of growling in the distance. "Why won't you all just stay down and die with dignity?"
Laura: We don't do anything with dignity. (all laugh)
Sam: Scanlan's lifeless corpse has a pool of urine around it. (all laugh)
Matt: All righty. Is that the end of your turn, Keyleth? Are you going to move forward?
Marisha: I'm going to-- can I see Pike?
Matt: Pike is right there next to you, yeah.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to reach around the corner and do a Healing Word.
Matt: All right, Healing Word.
Marisha: What, is it because I said "reach around"?
Laura: No, no.
Matt: Not at all.
Marisha: Jesus! Everything I say. Everything I say.
Matt: Level one, level two? What do you do?
Marisha: Level one. Because I'm pale and I just show everything.
Matt: d4 plus six.
Marisha: Nine.
Matt: Nine. So Pike heals nine hit points and is conscious.
Taliesin: Clapping from the void.
Travis: It's because of that saving throw.
Patrick rothfuss: And that resets the death saving throw?
Taliesin: Yeah, everything pops back.
Matt: All right. Bringing us back up to the top, Vax, you're up.
Liam: Now, with the boots of haste, one of the extra actions has to be for an attack, right? I couldn't do--
Matt: Correct. Well, it's attack, disengage, or dash, I think. It should say on the card.
Liam: Yeah, it says the extra action can be used to attack, dash, disengage, or hide. Shite. So I'm going to... balls. I'm going to go to the gnome on the ground and I'm going to cast Lay on Hands--
Laura: Which one?
Liam: Pike is up, isn't she?
Matt: Pike is conscious.
Liam: Conscious is what I mean. To Scanlan.
Matt: There you go.
Liam: And one hit point, just to get you up.
Matt: You're conscious.
Sam: Is this my urine or someone else's?
Patrick rothfuss: Someone peed on me while I was dead! (all laugh)
Travis: (laughing) Is this my urine or someone else's?
Sam: I don't know which is worse.
Taliesin: Only one way to find out. Does it taste like anything you've had recently?
Sam: Asparagus. That's me.
Matt: Oh, god. All right.
Liam: I'm going to use a little more movement to move to the same spot that Bigby's was before it was gone. Maybe into the-- the cloud's gone, right?
Matt: Cloud's gone, it got burned off in the Firestorm.
Liam: Maybe I'll even go ten more feet forward--
Matt: Okay, you slam into the physical form.
Liam: Vow of Enmity.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: As a bonus action.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: And I will use the extra action to disengage and get the fuck out.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Whoa!
Marisha: What's that? What's that? What'd you do?
Matt: Back up how far?
Liam: I'm going to go that way. Back towards Scanlan.
Matt: This way? Okay.
Liam: I should have 60 feet of movement hasted.
Matt: Yes, and as you back up--
Liam: Disengage.
Matt: Yeah, disengage, yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: Nicely done.
Liam: I will actually go along the wall.
Matt: So you'll be like over here.
Liam: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: Okay. All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to... Jesus Christ. I'm going to run over to Allura and I'm going to cast 3rd-level Cure Wounds on her.
Matt: Okay. Healing her--
Laura: 3d8 plus three. Fifteen points.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And then... 30 feet, no. Fuck! That's my action, isn't it?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Laura: I guess as a bonus action I'm going to... hide? I'm such a loser.
Matt: So you're going to move over here and hide?
Laura: Yeah? I guess?
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Laura: Okay, let me see if I have any health potions left, though. I have a regular healing potion left.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: So I'm going to take that.
Matt: It's 2d4 plus two.
Laura: Ooh! Eight points healed.
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up.
Laura: And a stealth check.
Matt: Stealth check, yes.
Taliesin: Do I still have any theory of where she is, or do I have to roll another perception check?
Matt: I mean, just where she was previously standing.
Patrick rothfuss: He just bumped into something.
Liam: Yeah, you would've seen me go--
Taliesin: So yeah, again, as I'm scootching further and further back along the wall, I'm going to pull out the Animus box and take a few shots in there to see what happens.
Matt: Okay, disadvantage on all these strikes because she is invisible.
Taliesin: Because she is invisible.
Liam: Get it nerd, get it.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to burn a grit for the first one to neutralize that.
Laura: Can I not have gone back behind the stalagmite, I want to go around the corner. Yeah, like that.
Matt: That's as far as you can get, unfortunately.
Laura: Okay. That's fine. I rolled a 16.
Taliesin: So, shot number one. Natural 20.
Matt: Is this with disadvantage, or did you use the grit point?
Taliesin: I used the grit point to cancel out the disadvantage.
Matt: You did, all right. All right. Roll some damage.
Taliesin: And that will not affect the Cabal's Ruin damage I was going to add to it, because that's a different thing, right?
Matt: Um.
Taliesin: Because that seems unfair because I can add that later.
Matt: Yeah, adding that to a crit is a little intense. I'd say no.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm just going to add the standard damage. I'm not going to crit the Cabal's Ruin damage, but I'm adding--
Matt: Correct.
Liam: The dragon doesn't blow up?
Taliesin: That's a thing.
Matt: The benefit is you can choose to apply it after the hit.
Taliesin: After the hit.
Matt: The downside is you can't add it to the crit.
Taliesin: Totally worth it.
Matt: So you never waste it.
Taliesin: No. So that's, let's see, that's six points of psychic damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And 18 points of normal damage.
Matt: So 24.
Taliesin: And then I'm going to add three points of Cabal's Ruin, which is--
Sam: Whoa!
Taliesin: 14 points of lightning damage.
Matt: 38.
Taliesin: Yep.
Sam: Does all that double because it was a crit?
Taliesin: No. No, that is doubled.
Matt: That's 38 points to that first hit. She's going to make a concentration check.
Taliesin: And I also get my grit point back because I critted.
Matt: It's true.
Laura: I think it's time for some Advil. (all laugh)
Laura: Critical Role, brought to you by Advil.
Matt: Fails the concentration check on the invisibility.
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: Is going to spend another legendary resistance to succeed it.
Marisha: So she's spent two?
Matt: She's spent two.
Laura: That's good, that's good.
Taliesin: That's fine. Now for my second shot, I'm going to spend a second point to-- oh, she's not visible, she's--
Matt: Correct, she maintained concentration.
Sam: Did she blink into visibility?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: So I still have disadvantage so I still need to--
Matt: You do.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fine.
Matt: Are you doing another grit point to cancel it?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Not quite as good, but still good. 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Taliesin: So that's, ooh, that's nice. That's 17 points of normal damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Two points of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And ten points of lightning damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: For my next shot--
Matt: Natural 20 on the save, so she saves concentration. It's maintained.
Taliesin: I'm doing the same thing again, so I'm at two grit points.
Marisha: Kill that resistance, kill that legendary resistance.
Taliesin: I'm trying.
Marisha: Come on, Percy.
Taliesin: Not going to hit, that's going to be 19 to hit. That doesn't hit.
Matt: No.
Taliesin: So that one misses. I still have three Cabal's Ruin, though, so that's nice. I'm going to use my bonus action for a heal surge, for my little healing, my little pick-me-up.
Matt: Great.
Taliesin: So that's going to give me back 16 points of healing points, so that's 16 to me, so that's... 105, I'm at 105. And I'm going to keep just scooting back along the wall. I want to keep where I'm shooting in my line of sight, but I just want to get there. Yeah, and still on the wall.
Matt: Okay, gotcha. That ends your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Good turn, man, good turn.
Taliesin: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Matt: It is now Raishan's turn.
Sam: Oh balls.
Matt: Let's see here.
Taliesin: Look, every time I have a reaction I can do something. That's crazy. This is mean.
Patrick rothfuss: Can I see that?
Matt: Uh... hm. Raishan is fed up with this whole down-then-up, down-then-up yo-yoing.
Travis: Good, flee, do it again!
Matt: Raishan, Scanlan, as you're on the ground, just getting your bearings back to consciousness, you watch as your head is across the ground, the rocks kind of (impact sound), and something seems to hit the ground right next to you. Raishan's going to do a full round of just physical attacks on you.
Sam: Great. It won't take very much since I've got the one hit point. But maybe my 14 AC will protect me.
Matt: You are prone, so attack rolls on you have advantage within five feet, which is good, because the first attack was a one. And an 18 plus... so the first hit, which is its bite, hits you for 13 plus eight--
Sam: I mean, I'm unconscious now.
Taliesin: Do you have any reactions you can do?
Sam: I don't know. I can't remember when the last time I used a reaction was. Was it this round or the round before?
Matt: Round before.
Laura: So you could.
Matt: Well, your turn's next, so you have used it... no, you're right, it was, it has been since the last time. So yeah. It was an 18 to hit.
Liam: This could be the difference between--
Marisha: Yeah, life and death.
Liam: Because one or two death saves, three death saves.
Sam: All right.
Laura: Because a full round is four attacks? Or three attacks?
Matt: For Raishan? You don't know.
Laura: I bet it's four attacks.
Liam: This is down to the wire, dude.
Laura: This could be it, Scanlan!
Marisha: Yeah, do it, do it. Do all you can.
Sam: Okay, I'll say to Raishan this time, "You so dumb, when thieves stole your horse, you chased them down and said, 'You forgot the saddle!'" (all laugh)
Matt: He utters, with a weak breath on the floor of the necromancer's sanctum.
Laura: These could be Scanlan's final words.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d12, please.
Marisha: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: Six.
Matt: So it's 18 minus six is a 12. (All cheer.)
Matt: So whoosh.
Marisha: You did it with your shitty retort.
Sam: Now just three more attacks to dodge and I'll be okay.
Liam: That was the bite, wasn't it?
Matt: There's two more claw attacks.
Laura: Raishan gets four attacks, so if you would've failed that, your instant death save would've failed.
Matt: So that's 21 to hit.
Sam: Oh, that'll hit, sure.
Matt: So with that you take 4d6 plus eight.
Taliesin: Let's just call it.
Matt: Yeah, you're unconscious. And the final claw attack has advantage, which hits you, and it's a crit. So you lose two death saving throws.
Taliesin: We're going to have to deal with that very, very quickly.
Travis: Where are you? Can you point to him on the map?
Sam: I'm the pink one.
Matt: Right there. And the impact seems to be coming from this area, here.
Sam: So wait, they can see my body sort of like moving?
Matt: Yeah, getting hit on the ground.
Marisha: We can see him getting beat the shit out of.
Matt: Getting mangled by something that's not currently there. And then (whooshing sounds), the wind kicks up as something seems to shift the air.
Laura: Can anybody feel it flying past?
Matt: You can feel it move in this direction.
Laura: Great.
Matt: With that, yeah, I can just make it through without an attack of opportunity--
Liam: Yeah, can I do an attack of opportunity as it flies by?
Travis: Yeah, I'm right there too.
Matt: You sense it not far enough from you to be able to attack something with an attack of opportunity.
Liam: All right.
Matt: That ends Raishan's turn. Scanlan. Death saving throw.
Laura: Oh my god, oh my god.
Sam: Three.
Matt: And with that, the breath escapes Scanlan's lungs, the smile across his face, as life leaves his form.
Sam: This time I died with a bad joke and piss all over me. (All laughing.)
Matt: He died as he lived  hard or after a bad joke with piss all over him. All right. That ends Scanlan's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah. Uh. Dragon moved. Scanlan dead. (raspberry) Did I detect which direction el dragon flew in?
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Travis: Yeah. Sure. Three.
Matt: You're not entirely certain. You just saw something (whoosh) through the air in this vicinity.
Travis: I am just going to throw a hammer in that direction.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: In there.
Matt: Roll with disadvantage.
Travis: Yup. Can I make it reckless?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: One roll? Does that zero out the disadvantage?
Matt: Yep.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: She has a higher AC because she's technically heavily obscured.
Travis: Right. 27.
Matt: 27? 27 just hits. You got lucky and just flung it out in the middle of nowhere, because of the AC bonus of her being heavily obscured. So yeah, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Nice. That's good.
Patrick rothfuss: Now you have a better idea of where she is.
Travis: Yeah, can I keep track of where it hit her--
Liam: Can we all see the hammer fly through the air?
Matt: You can see the hammer impact somewhere, and you watch it somewhere right up here.
Laura: Great.
Matt: Like, right above you.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23 damage.
Travis: 23 damage.
Matt: Okay. Maintains concentration. Hammer comes back.
Travis: Can I be thrilled that I hit something that I didn't see and smash the Titanstone Knuckles together to enlarge?
Matt: Sure. With that, your hammer grows in size as well.
Travis: Can I try and throw the hammer again?
Matt: You can.
Travis: At the same general area. One roll. Unless I know where she is now, but I doubt that.
Matt: I mean, you're still at disadvantage on the attacks. But you're going reckless, so it's all just straight hits.
Travis: That's a one, so I'm, no.
Matt: On both? With reckless?
Travis: I thought I couldn't see her, so it was disadvantage, reckless advantage, so just a single--
Matt: Oh right, yeah. Misses past, breaks into the rock and stone off the wall.
Travis: That's better. 31.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay. 18... 26... plus four for enlarged... 25. 25 damage.
Matt: 25 damage.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, I'm freaking out right now.
Matt: She fails her saving throw. Concentration... no, she wants to maintain that spell, so that's her last legendary resistance.
Marisha: Yeah, Grog! Yeah!
Matt: But she maintains concentration on the invisibility. So that was 25.
Travis: 25, I think.
Matt: Yeah, I got it. So that's the end of your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yes, it is.
Matt: Okay. You can move if you'd like. You just threw, it's all you did.
Travis: Oh, right. Yeah, I'm going to move in the direction that she flew.
Matt: Something hits your head as you get about there.
Travis: Ah! I get angry again.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Grog. At the... hm. Yeah. At the end of your turn...
Travis: Not a word. Not a word. (Nervous laughing.)
Matt: It's going to go ahead and--
Sam: Surrender.
Laura: She surrenders.
Matt: It's too close now. Yeah, just, we're done!
Liam: Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry.
Patrick rothfuss: Did we mention that this is all subduing damage?
Matt: (laughs)
Patrick rothfuss: So glad you got that joke.
Matt: Ah, subdual damage. Back in the day.
Taliesin: It was a kinder, gentler world.
Matt: I know. She's not going to use that ability yet. Instead is going to... oh, everyone's kind of moving around her.
Taliesin: I'd give money for a popcorn grenade right now.
Matt: Okay, you know? Is going to use two legendary actions to use a wing attack.
Travis: Two legendary actions.
Matt: So the wings start beating furiously in the air. I need Vax, Kima, Grog, and Vex to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Minus two, because, yeah. But advantage.
Matt: Wow. Allura actually made it.
Sam: Vex. (coughs) Inspiration.
Laura: Doesn't matter.
Sam: What?
Matt: That is a shitty roll. All right, so.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27, so.
Liam: Zero.
Matt: You take no damage. Vex? One! You take 13 points of bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone.
Sam: Are you still alive?
Laura: I'm still alive, you guys!
Sam: Wow.
Laura: Still standing. I'm not standing. Still--
Matt: Allura succeeds and takes no damage. Grog, what'd you roll?
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. Grog, you also, you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage and you're knocked prone.
Travis: Halved, halved.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Six.
Laura: Did you say 21 points of damage?
Matt: 13.
Laura: Oh, that's it? 13.
Matt: Yep. And the dragon moves half its flying speed.
Liam: Is it close, ah.
Matt: Yeah, just moves away at--
Taliesin: Do I get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: People who are not prone, yes. So Vax, you get to make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Laura: Oh, damn it. Sucks that you were knocked prone.
Travis: I know.
Liam: I'm going to use one Luck.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What does that mean, if I use luck? Disadvantage, and then I rolled a six and--
Matt: Your Vow of Enmity gives it advantage, though, doesn't it?
Liam: Say again?
Matt: Your Vow of Enmity?
Liam: That's right, it does. So that cancels out. So the first one-- but I'm still using Luck, so the first one was a six, the second one was a 31.
Matt: 31 hits. Yeah.
Laura: Yay!
Travis: Hit him!
Sam: Her.
Laura: Hit her!
Travis: Her!
Liam: Nine plus psychic damage... ten. 25.
Matt: 25 points of damage.
Patrick rothfuss: One more.
Travis: Kill all the other dice.
Matt: Yeah, maintains concentration and pulls away.
Taliesin: Do I get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: No. She hasn't moved past you.
Taliesin: She has not moved past me.
Matt: Nope. All right. That ends that turn. Kerrek, you're up.
Patrick rothfuss: I'm assuming-- yeah, I've got to be hearing that over on that side.
Matt: Yeah, you're hearing all the impacts, the slashing, the battle on this side.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay. Boy, 30 move. I can dash, right?
Matt: You can, yeah, as an action, so you can do twice your movement.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, so you just-- it's a movement, and then I burn my action to do another movement?
Matt: Correct, yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: How far over does... how far over does 30 get me there?
Matt: 30 would just get around the corner here.
Patrick rothfuss: Can I get 25 and just-- actually, I don't know she's invisible. So I go, dragon's coming around the corner, I want to hang at the corner and then effectively wait to attack.
Matt: So you're holding your action in case something shows up that you can hit.
Patrick rothfuss: Yep. Well, actually, I'm going to be around this corner, waiting for it to come into this.
Matt: Right there? Okay.
Patrick rothfuss: Gosh, I think... I think that's all I got.
Matt: Okay. All right, that ends Kerrek's turn. Let's see here. Kima sees you doing this and is going to go ahead and back you up right there. Sorry, Percy.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Spiderclimb makes you so easy to knock over. Kima, on her turn... is going to use Aura of Vitality again on herself and, utilizing that as a bonus action, is going to heal you for 2d6, Kerrek. So-- oh, not bad. 11 hit points. All righty. That ends Kima's turn. Allura. Allura, who is barely conscious with 15 hit points, is going to get to her feet. Perception check... natural 20.
Marisha: Allura is bae! (all laugh)
Matt: And is going to-- no, not third-level. She's going to go ahead and cast a fifth-level Dispel Magic.
Marisha: Yeah yeah yeah.
Matt: Which would-- yeah, it's just dispelled. And with that.
Laura: Finally!
Matt: Finally revealed on the field.
Laura: And she's just like covered in blood, she's just so beat-up.
Marisha: Yeah, she's barely hanging on.
Liam: She's looking pretty rough.
Marisha: She's got a single tear coming from her eye.
Laura: Oh god, she's like right there.
Taliesin: (nervous exclamation)
Liam: Look out, Perce.
Taliesin: I get the idea.
Liam: Put a counterweight.
Matt: Further over, just appears right in front of your face, Percival.
Laura: Just her butt.
Matt: (menacing growl, wing-sounds) And then Allura, using the rest of her movement, is going to here, here, here, and then actually Misty Step over here next to Keyleth to get out of the area. (breathing hard) "Keyleth, you have to finish this."
Marisha: Okay?!
Matt: That's going to end Allura's turn. Pike is up.
Laura: Pike. Okay.
Marisha: Is she still unconscious?
Laura: No, she's up. She's going to stand up and, if she uses her sprinter's boots, can she run over to Scanlan and cast Revivify? Would she be able to get to him?
Matt: She would just get to his side, yeah.
Laura: Okay, then she's going to cast Revivify on Scanlan.
Matt: All right, so. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add her wisdom modifier.
Taliesin: Do you also have inspiration still?
Laura: Pike didn't have it.
Taliesin: No, Pike, oh-- okay.
Matt: He died twice, the DC is 12.
Laura: So...
Liam: Plus her wisdom, whatever you roll plus the wisdom.
Matt: Yeah, so d20 plus five.
Laura: (small voice) Nine.
Matt: Nine, okay.
Travis: What?
Matt: So the Revivify fails. Reaches out and doesn't hit.
Laura: God fucking damn it!
Matt: You're still dead. You're not permanently dead, but you cannot be revived for the remainder of this battle. You can only use a ritual to return, and the DC does go up to a 13.
Taliesin: Okay, okay.
Sam: Ritual of return?
Taliesin: It's the last-ditch.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Currently, you get-- Pike touches and releases the energy of the spell into Scanlan's body, and you feel the necrotic essence of this necromancer's sanctum, the very dark nature of this place, is preventing the connection between the spirit and the body of Scanlan at the moment. The spell having no effect. Pike still has a bonus action if she'd like.
Laura: She's going to throw Sacred Flame at Raishan.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And that's at 17th level, which she's at now, right?
Matt: Sacred Flame is an action.
Laura: It is.
Matt: Needs to be a bonus action, unfortunately.
Laura: Balls. Great. Tight. She-- can she do like a heal--
Matt: She can do a Healing Word.
Laura: Healing Word, tight. She's going to do that on herself, then.
Matt: Level two?
Laura: Sure.
Matt: All right, so 2d4 plus five.
Laura: 11.
Matt: 11. All righty, so that heals her up.
Patrick rothfuss: God. If I can just fucking get close enough to stick one on her.
Taliesin: I'm going to get stupid, so.
Marisha: I know, samesies.
Matt: All right, that ends Pike's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Taliesin: Well. Things have gotten simpler.
Marisha: Okay. Hearing Allura's words and seeing Scanlan down, can I get a movement to where I can get over here and see her? Keep going, keep going.
Matt: You can see her there.
Marisha: I can see her there?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I'm assuming she's within 150 feet of me.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: This is kind of like a hail mary. Oh, jesus fuck. All right. I am going to cast... (laughs) my one 8th-level spell, and I'm going to attempt to Feeblemind her.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, she's used up all her legendary saves.
Marisha: Exactly. Exactly.
Matt: All righty. And it is an intelligence saving throw--
Laura: Oh, she's really smart.
Marisha: Yes, which she's really good at, but we could get lucky.
Matt: Four plus four. Rolled a four. She has an intelligence modifier of four, and it is not one of her saving throws.
Marisha: Shut up!
Matt: Her intelligence and charisma become one, cannot cast spells, cannot activate magical items.
Patrick rothfuss: Up top, up top!
Marisha: Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!
Travis: Did that really happen? Did that work?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: It's permanent, right? For 30 days.
Marisha: She can keep saving from it.
Matt: Yeah, at the end of every 30 days she can repeat the saving throw. (Cheers and yelling.)
Travis: Oh my god, she fell, she fell off.
Taliesin: Holy fuck. That looks painful.
Laura: Are you okay?
Liam: Marisha, what a beautiful moment! Get it, get it!
Taliesin: We've still got problems.
Marisha: We still have problems.
Matt: As you reach out, you watch as the tendrils of nature's energy begin to spill out of the cracks in the vicinity.
Marisha: And I just say, "Melora, come on, girl! Come on, Melora!"
Matt: You watch as Raishan chuckles. One of the tendrils lashes out and wraps around the throat. And as they wrap and begin to strengthen around the neck, pouring into the cracks of the flesh where the disease currently holds her throat, her brow begins to sink, the jaw hangs open, and slobber begins to drip from her jaw as Raishan just, as opposed to speaking, now does a guttural (heavy breaths and growling).
Liam: Poetic justice, motherfucker!
Travis: Still got a dragon. Still got a dragon.
Marisha: She can still attack. "Grog! Grog, get her down!" Is all I can scream before I just, my mind is blown.
Matt: Okay, so is that the end of your turn?
Marisha: And then, panicking--
Matt: You still have a bonus action, right?
Marisha: I do.
Matt: And technically ten more feet of movement.
Marisha: Uh-huh. I'm going to go back towards Allura. Huh?
Matt: All these spells. Cannot use them now.
Liam: That's right, Matt! That's right.
Marisha: (yells) Okay. I'm going to go--
Laura: That's karma for trying to kill Pike while she's not here.
Marisha: Towards Allura, and heal the fuck out of myself.
Travis: You killed one of our gnomes!
Matt: I didn't, the dragon did.
Marisha: I going to do a-- Jesus, I can't speak. I'm going to do a third-level Cure Wounds on myself--
Matt: You can only do up to second level because you cast an eighth-level.
Marisha: I'm sorry. I'm going to do.
Matt: It's a Healing Word, bonus action.
Marisha: Oh right, it's a bonus action. I'm sorry. I will do a second-level Healing Word.
Matt: All right. 2d4 plus six.
Liam: Wow. Wow.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: That brings us to the top. Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm just going to unload on her.
Matt: Except for, at the end of your turn, actually, going to go ahead and use a legendary action to do a tail attack against you, Percy.
Taliesin: Do I get a reaction against that?
Matt: A reaction?
Taliesin: I can't react to her attack. Okay, she's just going to do a legendary attack against me.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: I mean. That is 23 to hit.
Taliesin: Oh, that hits.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Keyleth is at 28 hit points.
Matt: You take 21 points of bludgeoning damage. All right. Now, what are you doing, Vax?
Liam: I'm unloading, dagger-dagger-dagger.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: At advantage on all of it. And can I do-- I've got two spells left, so can I do Smite and Smite? Because it just says on melee attacks, it doesn't say how many a round or anything. I don't know, I've never tried to do it.
Matt: No, on each attack you can do Smite, that's fine.
Liam: All right, so. First attack is-- hits, it's 32. Second attack--
Matt: With a melee weapon attack.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Matt: So you have to be up next to her.
Liam: Well, let's just say I Whisper onto her neck.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: He's whispering sweet nothings.
Taliesin: Into her neck?
Marisha: Into her neck.
Laura: Her feeble little mind.
Marisha: Into her feeble mind.
Taliesin: It's called a hickey.
Liam: So that's the first attack, and I get Smite. Second attack is a 27.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: I'm just going to do dagger-dagger, actually.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And the first attack--
Matt: Neither of these are sharpshooter because they're melee.
Liam: That's all right. I didn't ask for that. So that's one plus eight is nine, plus the psychic damage makes it 12, plus Smite is... 22, plus sneakies. Yes, yes, yes. (counting) 53 is the first attack.
Matt: 53 points of damage.
Travis: Come on, come on.
Laura: Come on!
Liam: Second attack is also getting, okay, so one, just one, okay. Plus five and... eight. All right. And I'm going to use my bonus action to disengage and just leap away from her and just tumble-crash to the ground.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Does she still have an attack of opportunity against disengagement, or did that legendary action--
Matt: No, disengage doesn't have to. Make an acrobatics check, though.
Liam: Okay.
Taliesin: Well, I'm just curious because I'm going to have a problem in a moment.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25, you land on both feet without an issue.
Marisha: I got really excited and forgot to roll the damage that Feeblemind does. Which is 4d6 psychic damage.
Matt: Oh. You did.
Marisha: I just got real excited that it worked. I'm sorry.
Travis: You fell off a bench!
Laura: You're going to have a big ol' bump on the back of your head.
Matt: Roll 4d6. Go for it.
Marisha: Okay. It'll be fine. The adrenaline-- I don't feel it right now. 4d6.
Matt: 4d6.
Liam: And I have 60 of movement, so leaping off and rolling, does that use it all up, or can I move against the wall? Just keep going after I disengage from her?
Matt: You can move against the wall and get there.
Liam: Thanks. Tuck and roll.
Taliesin: Technically, wasn't she flanked, too?
Liam: I already get advantage.
Marisha: 13 points of psychic damage.
Matt: No, because you were-- how much?
Marisha: 13.
Matt: 13? All right.
Liam: I got the paladin eyes on her.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: All righty. That ends your turn. All right, at the end of her turn she's going to use her last legendary action to attack Percy once more. That is a 27 to hit.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: She's just whaling on you.
Taliesin: I'm the only thing within reach.
Matt: 23 points of bludgeoning damage.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: You're doing okay.
Laura: Jeez, how are you?
Patrick rothfuss: You're pretty good.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Laura: Oh yeah, he was in the hundreds.
Taliesin: 23 points... 61 right now. I'm at 61. Not wonderful but, you know.
Liam: That is the most perfect, poetic moment.
Marisha: It's like you and Thordak, man.
Liam: Could not have been better.
Matt: All right. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. Using disengage, can you run past them with disengage?
Matt: Yeah, essentially disengage, you go into combat and then you can leave combat without getting an attack of opportunity on you.
Laura: Okay, but I'm already in range of her.
Matt: You are just outside of her range, technically.
Laura: Oh, really?
Matt: Yeah, her reach-- actually, with the tail? No, but she's up in the air. I'll say you're just out of the range of the tail.
Laura: Okay. How far away, if I ran past her, would I be able to get? If I ran to the other side of her.
Matt: You can get just to the side of Kerrek.
Laura: Okay, then I'm just going to back up.
Matt: Okay, so half your movement there to get up from prone, so you can move fifteen more-- you've got three more squares you can move.
Laura: I'm just going to back up into that-- dink dink dink--
Matt: To there?
Laura: Yeah, and I'm going to shoot her.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Yeah, I already used blazing bowstring.
Matt: That Feeblemind.
Laura: Okay. 17.
Matt: 17 does not hit, no. Or the arrow hits and it just splinters across the outside of her body.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm just doomed today. 18.
Matt: 18. The second arrow does manage to strike the side of the shoulder, and then the arrow actually breaks against the dragon's hide and scales. That's going to end your turn. You still have a bonus action if you want to do something else.
Laura: I'm going to use-- well, I didn't use disengage.
Matt: You didn't use disengage.
Laura: Well, that's okay, I'll use my bonus action, fuck it, to do Grasping Vine. It's a bonus action.
Matt: All righty. From where and to where?
Laura: From the ground. I'm going to grab Raishan and pull her to the ground.
Matt: Pull her down? Okay. All righty. So Grasping Vine, here, that's going to be a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Matt: That is a five plus nine, that is 14. What is your spell DC?
Laura: 15! (All cheer.)
Matt: All right. So.
Taliesin: Do I get an attack of opportunity on this one?
Matt: No, because it is forced down. Raishan is pulled to the ground there.
Marisha: Like a dog who just peed on the carpet.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: I say, "You stay down, bitch!" And I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Marisha: I am too. (all laugh)
Marisha: I'm going to go too, while she's going.
Liam: In character, in character.
Travis: Leave the Mario way. (Mario sound effects)
Matt: All righty.
Patrick rothfuss: Just out of curiosity, I see there's-- from here, I can see there's plexiglass around there. How close is that, like, the edge of her character to me?
Matt: Right now, she would be ten feet from you.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: All right. That brings us to Percy's turn.
Taliesin: Weird question.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Am I still-- if I try to disengage right now, would I get attacked?
Matt: Yes. You are in melee.
Taliesin: I'm in melee. Okay. That's fine. I'm going to run around, I'm going to hit her with my sword. I'm pulling-- putting the gun away, pulling out the sword, and just taking some shots.
Travis: The Dragonslayer, right?
Taliesin: Yep. Okay. Let's see. The first one definitely missed, which is a 19, did not hit.
Matt: 19 misses, unfortunately. (guttural growling)
Taliesin: 22?
Matt: 22 just hits.
Taliesin: Okay. 22 and the other one is a 28, so I got two shots.
Matt: Yes, so two ones hit.
Taliesin: So let's do the first one, which is...
Travis: You aristocratic bastard.
Taliesin: 22 points of damage plus... 10 points of lightning damage.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Total of 32.
Taliesin: Total of 32. And the second slash is... 21 points of damage.
Matt: Nice. Okay.
Sam: He was aiming at the eggs, though.
Taliesin: The whole time.
Matt: The entire time. That's perfect.
Taliesin: So I'm... I'm now going to disengage, I'm going to let him take that shot and I'm going to run towards--
Patrick rothfuss: If you can pull her towards us?
Taliesin: We'll see. I'm heading towards the eggs.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Full speed.
Matt: So as you go rushing, she's going to go ahead and make a claw swipe at you.
Sam: I died again.
Matt: That is--
Patrick rothfuss: (laughs) You died again.
Matt: That is a natural 20.
Taliesin: Okay, that hits.
Matt: Sorry, buddy.
Taliesin: That's okay. I regret nothing.
Liam: No, no, no.
Laura: No, stop it, stop it.
Taliesin: Stop making noises, it's not polite. Stop counting.
Matt: 40 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: As the claw strikes you from behind.
Travis: So like, retaliated against it?
Matt: So. Where are you going now?
Taliesin: I'm running six spaces towards the eggs and turning around and pulling the gun back out and sitting on the wall like Spiderman, like an angry Spiderman.
Matt: All righty. That ends your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Anything I can do with my bonus action? No.
Sam: Drink something.
Patrick rothfuss: Before she goes-- because I'm not familiar with the hold action rules. I was waiting around the corner for the dragon to show up.
Matt: Correct. It's not in range to you. The moment the dragon comes into range, you can strike.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, so that's the deciding factor--
Matt: Correct.
Patrick rothfuss: -- even though she showed up, I can't finish my move that I delayed?
Matt: Unfortunately, with the fifth edition rules, they make it so it's like a quick reaction.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: However, the dragon does fly past to get around the edge to this side here.
Laura: God, she's just going after Percy. She had a crush on you, man.
Taliesin: I... no. She may vaguely remember that I was not cool.
Travis: You tried to kill her, yeah.
Liam: In this state, she's just going to mount you.
Matt: You do get to make your attack as she comes into range, flying past for you.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, okay. That's all I need, just a chance.
Laura: My hand-dragon's on your shoulder.
Liam: Not like this. Not like this.
Laura: (laughing) Not like this.
Sam: Guys, now that I don't have to play, I'm playing Marvel Puzzle Quest. (all laugh)
Sam: It's addictive!
Laura: Like seriously, Sam has stacked up his binder, he's closed everything like he's getting ready to go.
Marisha: This is sad. This is sad.
Sam: I can't do anything.
Taliesin: No, this is the rest of the day for him, there's nowhere to go for-- yeah.
Liam: Just put your head down on the desk, student.
Taliesin: Think about what you've done.
Marisha: Heads up, seven up.
Liam: Heads up, seven up.
Sam: It was not your fault, Laura. It was Ashley's.
Patrick rothfuss: 20, which is not going to make it, I'm guessing?
Matt: A total of twenty? No, unfortunately.
Laura: (tearfully) I just rolled bad, I'm sorry.
Patrick rothfuss: Mother. Fucker. I miss with both. Got no juice to throw on it either.
Matt: First swing just goes wide, the second one hits the side, but you haven't hit hard ancient dragon hide before, and it scrapes across the outside with no noticeable damage and a little seed of fear wells in your heart once more.
Patrick rothfuss: Yep, that's okay. I got to use these actions that were going to be wasted anyway.
Matt: All right. As Raishan slams down onto the ground--
Patrick rothfuss: Was she holding action alongside me?
Matt: No, she cast a spell to heal you last turn as a bonus action.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: Raishan is going to unleash upon you, Percy, who has avoided the Meteor Swarm, who has shot her in the face, and right now in her feral state is just focused on what's closest and angry at her.
Taliesin: Okay, yeah, all right.
Matt: First strike, that is a 26 to hit.
Taliesin: Oh Jesus, how is this happening?
Matt: With the bite. That is 17 plus eight... 25 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm out.
Marisha: Oh no, oh no.
Matt: So you fall to the ground.
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: No no no no no.
Travis: Here we go. (clears throat) Jenga?
Matt: So you lose a death save.
Taliesin: I know. Oh, is that lose a death save? I was only a few feet up, it wasn't like a-- it wasn't-- okay. All right.
Matt: You were just a few feet up? As opposed to?
Taliesin: I mean, I was-- yeah.
Liam: I mean, an eight-foot drop on your head is pretty bad.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's pretty bad. I'm taking it.
Patrick rothfuss: You could leave him with one foot stuck to the wall.
Taliesin: Ow. Ow. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Like a punching bag.
Sam: It's going to be Shorthalt and de Rolo in heaven, just--
Taliesin: Oh, it's so cute that you think either of us are going to heaven.
Matt: Going to angrily take a claw attack at your body, which hits, a critical, that's two death saving throws--
Patrick rothfuss: A critical?
Matt: Percy, you're dead.
Taliesin: I'm out.
Matt: As the bite knocks you to the ground, the claw slams down onto your torso, and just tears out the side of your body, your entrails scattered across the stone floor--
Sam: You're up, Laura. Roll good.
Matt: -- and your breath just escapes out. Kerrek, you and Kima both there watch this happen as Percy is now partially spread across the stone immediately to the right of you.
Taliesin: The blood is in fact blue.
Matt: And Raishan gets her legendary actions back. That's going to end Raishan's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah! Grog would like to get up.
Liam: Stand up.
Travis: What does that take for me to do that?
Matt: That's half your movement. 25.
Travis: Half my movement. Can I use the rest of my movement to run towards dragon-dick?
Marisha: Towards dragon-dick?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: 25. That's as far as you can get.
Travis: Can I use the boots of feral leaping to leap even further.
Matt: Make your athletics check.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: Wait a minute, did she even roll to break her Grasping Vine?
Matt: Grasping Vine doesn't keep her restrained, it just grabs somebody and pulls them there, it's meant to move things--
Travis: Natural 20 on that one.
Marisha: Natural 20?
Travis: Yeah, on my leaping. (all laugh)
Marisha: Well, I mean, that's still cool.
Travis: I leap through her chest. Boom!
Liam: Pacman through it?
Travis: Yeah. So I have my three attacks, yes?
Matt: Yes. You're not in melee, you didn't quite get far enough to get--
Travis: Imma have to throw 'em. Reckless, not negated because I can see her now.
Matt: Correct.
Travis: Right. 30.
Matt: Yeah, that'll hit.
Travis: Okay. 23 for the first one.
Matt: 23 damage? All righty.
Travis: The second one I'll make reckless and great weapon master.
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Okay. No, I can't do great weapon master because it's one-handed.
Matt: Yeah, no, well, it's thrown, you can only do it with melee.
Travis: Right. Jesus. 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Travis: 23 for the second one.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Piece of shit for the third one. Wait, where's--
Matt: 23, you said?
Travis: 23.
Laura: Does Kima have Revivify, do you think?
Sam: Don't you have two of them?
Travis: Third attack.
Marisha: Maybe, she might. Are you guys out of Revivifies?
Laura: No, Pike has lots more spells.
Taliesin: We've got time.
Travis: 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Taliesin: In a minute. That's a long time.
Patrick rothfuss: A minute's a long time.
Taliesin: Ten rounds.
Laura: She's got little legs.
Marisha: Matt gets weird about the minute rule. Just keep that in mind. I think the sooner you do it, the easier.
Taliesin: Yeah, I know.
Travis: 26 for the third one.
Taliesin: Matt does get weird about the minute rule, that is also funny.
Sam: Right now, Scanlan's getting fed grapes by little cherubs that are the same size as him. (all laugh)
Sam: And he's like, come on, Percy, we've got red and green grapes.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Grog?
Laura: Like, the ultimate punishment for Scanlan is he would show up as a spectral servant in somebody else's mansion?
Sam: Oh god!
Travis: No, the last one I rolled a one on the damage, I reroll ones or twos with that first thing of fighter?
Sam: You want what? Oh. All right.
Matt: That's for the larger weapon. I'll double-check real fast.
Travis: Yeah, I don't remember what the number was, anyway.
Matt: Well, here, just to remind myself. The weapon... a melee weapon you're wielding with two hands, which as you're throwing it, you're not.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: So no. All right, got it. That ends Grog's turn. Kerrek, you're up.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh please, please just let me, all I want to do is stick at least one on this god damned dragon.
Marisha: Come on, Kerr-bear!
Liam: Yes!
Patrick rothfuss: Okay. So there is 26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Laura: Yeah!
Patrick rothfuss: And a 20. I'm guessing the 20--
Matt: 20 misses, unfortunately.
Patrick rothfuss: Unless this dragon is so surprised that I finally made a successful attack. (all laugh)
Matt: No, unfortunately, the feral angry unintelligible state of Raishan right now as just a beast, no. Not surprised. Instinct now.
Patrick rothfuss: So I'm going to burn my second-level spell for Smite and she is not anything that is specifically affected by Doomhammer here? She's not undead technically or--
Matt: No.
Patrick rothfuss: Just regular old evil?
Matt: Yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Marisha: Regular old evil.
Taliesin: She's just awful.
Marisha: Classic evil.
Patrick rothfuss: Just... just bad. So that's ten... 18... one more. 28.
Matt: 28 points of damage?
Patrick rothfuss: 28.
Travis: She dies suddenly. A cardiac arrest.
Matt: At a max hit points of 520... How do you want to do this? (Screaming and cheering.)
Matt: Literally had seven hit points left. As far as my math goes, yeah.
Liam: Level seven!
Matt: I can't fucking believe-- I can't fucking believe that happened!
Laura: Kerrek just like leveled up to like...
Matt: So. How do you want to do this?
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Oh my god, Kerrek!
Matt: The feral beast there, tearing the innards out of Percy on the ground, Grog slamming into it, just seemingly bashing against the world, watching everyone drop around you like flies, your warhammer in hand.
Patrick rothfuss: What I would like to do is step over to be over his body, and it's like, no, no further. And as the dragon is coming in, just trying to mindlessly claw at this poor destroyed corpse... I like to think of the anime slow-mo strike, where the hammer comes back and it slows down and then when it connects you get the big starburst. Wow, okay.
Matt: As the hammer arcs downward (slow-mo sound effects). It just slams into the snout of Raishan just as the head turns up, the eyes that were once reptilian and intelligent are now just filled with bloodshot rage and feral intensity. The jaw is attempting to snap up and catch the blade, however, you're too fast. Your old adventuring reflexes are kicking in. As the glowing hammerhead comes down onto the snout, the divine energy blasts forward, and you watch as the dragon's face explodes, inverting inward, the front of the skull being blown backward, and you guys watch as this flash of light fills the entirety of this necrotic space. This one plume of radiant smoke kind of pssssh. And left behind, you see Kerrek standing there, holding the rod, the actual head of the hammer now dismissed as part of the burst of radiant energy, and there the smoking ruin of the throat, headless, of Raishan the Diseased Deceiver, collapsing to the ground, unmoving. And we're going to take a quick break. Take a break, and we're going to take a little time to take in the aftermath of this moment before we finish tonight's episode. So we'll be back here in a few minutes, we're going to go ahead and use the restroom. We'll see you guys here shortly.
Travis: Oh my god!
Marisha: Holy shit! [BREAK]
Matt: And welcome back. So. Last we left off, the battle with Raishan ended with a victory for Vox Machina but at a rather high cost at the moment. As you stand now in the still silence, the aftermath of the fray, looking down, seeing your allies beaten, bruised, disheveled, Scanlan lifeless on the ground on one side of this cavern, and a partially gutted Percy lifeless on the other, the smoldering ruin that was once the head of Raishan lifeless and still on the ground as Kerrek clutches the hammer. Kima walks over and grabs your shoulder and tightly squeezes it, going, "You did what had to be done. Thank you."
Patrick rothfuss: I mean, I've been around, I can't help him, can I?
Matt: "I think he's beyond either of our power now. Allie? Please tell me she's alive." And Kima runs off, realizing that she doesn't really know the status of the rest of the group. Allura shouts out to her on the side.
Laura: What's happening?
Matt: I'm all right!
Patrick rothfuss: I get down there, and I'm doing, I'm doing useless combat triage.
Matt: Trying to gather what you--
Patrick rothfuss: You do what you can.
Matt: What's outside, putting it back in. Yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: And I've-- yeah.
Laura: Vax?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Are you up?
Liam: Yeah. Yeah.
Laura: Good. Percival? How are you?
Marisha: Sound off if you're alive.
Travis: Alive.
Liam: I start stumbling over towards Scanlan.
Marisha: Percy.
Laura: "Percy?" I go running around the corner.
Marisha: Same.
Matt: As you guys both kind of run, Keyleth a bit behind, Vex, you turn and you see Raishan's corpse just piled, and then on the ground you see Kerrek slowly and methodically, almost staring off into a memory, trying to gather a bit of Percival's scattered innards from the side torn open.
Laura: "No. No!" And I run over to him. "Help him! Pike!"
Matt: Pike comes running around the corner. "Oh, God." And she runs up real fast and begins gathering her Revivify spell.
Travis: Wh-where's Scanlan?
Liam: I pick him up. I start walking towards Grog with him.
Matt: Did either of you guys want to roll for Pike's Revivify?
Liam: On Percy?
Laura: On Percy.
Matt: Percival, yeah.
Travis: Do you want Matt to do this, so that there's no--
Laura: I--
Liam: I'll do it. I don't want you to have-- I don't want you to-- get out of your head, I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll do it. It's just dice. It's the universe. That's low.
Laura: Oh, no. Is that a five?
Liam: Plus six.
Laura: Plus what? It's not going to work.
Matt: Six plus five?
Laura: Eleven.
Matt: Percival has died... how many times?
Laura: I don't know.
Marisha: Once.
Matt: I think just once for him, right?
Liam: The big one.
Marisha: It works. It works. It's just enough. It's just enough.
Travis: Wait, how many times has he died?
Matt: We're double-checking. Taliesin.
Travis: Taliesin, how many times have you died?
Taliesin: Does the necklace count, or does the necklace not count?
Matt: The necklace does not count.
Taliesin: Once. As far as I can remember.
Laura: 'Cause the necklace just instantly bamfed him back.
Matt: Yeah, similar to the effect earlier.
Liam: Yeah, it's a shield.
Marisha: Oh, come on, come on.
Patrick rothfuss: If that's going on, I've got like 30 points of Lay on Hands just that I have not had a chance to use, and I'm probably not in great shape. I'm probably going to be trying to use it even though I know better.
Matt: So as you're trying to grab the body and trying to make it form, it's not-- it's not doing anything and the healing magic is not taking effect into the now-still cold body. As Pike's metallic hand comes into your visual frame, Kerrek, you watch in that slow breathless motion as her gauntleted arm reaches down and touches the clavicle of the bloody mess of Percy's torso. And as the divine energy pulses warmth once more through the chest, you watch as the bits of exposed organ that you had pushed in close over with skin. (breathes) And breath comes back to Percival's body. You come to consciousness. Barely.
Taliesin: Quick question.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay, just checking. Okay. Good to know.
Laura: I just kiss-kiss-kiss-kiss, tears-tears-tears-tears.
Taliesin: Oh, that's nice.
Laura: Welcome back. Don't look down, you're a bloody mess.
Taliesin: (panicked laughter) Oh. Is this mine?
Marisha: No?
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to pass out.
Travis: Are we all here, then?
Liam: Grog!
Laura: Scanlan was down.
Marisha: Scanlan's down.
Travis: I take off running for Vax.
Matt: Okay. As you turn around the corner--
Liam: I've got him in my arms.
Matt: Kima and Allura are rushing up to you now as well. "Is he--" And you turn the corner, Grog, and you see Vax holding the still body of Scanlan, just dangling out of his arms.
Travis: No. No. No! Fix him! FIX HIM!
Liam: I just start to rock him like a child.
Travis: Well, somebody do something.
Taliesin: We have to take him home.
Marisha: We have to get him out of here.
Travis: Well, we got all these people with magic, you've all got magic spells, you just brought him back. Fix him!
Laura: Pike looks at Kima. "Can you do anything?"
Matt: This is-- this is beyond any of my capabilities. I-- look, I have a certain skillset, and it's not this kind of skillset, I'm sorry.
Marisha: Vax, the Raven Queen. You can talk to her, right? Vax?
Travis: I mean, what do we need? Do we need, like--
Marisha: Okay. We have to get him out of here, because this place sucks.
Taliesin: We need to take him somewhere. To the temple. And we need to find his daughter.
Marisha: Um, okay. Question. Oh, you didn't kill anything, did you, Vex? There's no, like Fenthras-trees?
Laura: No.
Marisha: There's no trees?
Matt: No trees.
Laura: Can Allura do--
Matt: Allura says, "I do have a teleport spell I can utilize. Gather everyone around."
Taliesin: I'm going to drop the gate stone that we have right in this room. I'm just going to leave it here.
Liam: You know, you're very funny, but this is not very funny.
Taliesin: I'm coming back here to dissect that monster once we're done.
Marisha: That's fair. Okay, let's save our friend.
Matt: "All right. Let's all of us gather our hands together." She puts her hands out, Kima takes one side, and you all form a circle.
Taliesin: I am lying down to do this, but yes.
Matt: She closes her eyes. She begins the incantation under her breath.
Travis: Why did he roll?
Laura: Why is she rolling?
Matt: There's a brief flux of arcane energy, and then it fades and you all remain in place.
Travis: Fuck.
Marisha: No.
Matt: She goes, "Um."
Marisha: What's wrong?
Matt: I don't know, something is-- something is barring my--
Patrick rothfuss: It's this place. The dragon said that there were features to this place.
Marisha: Oh, fuck. We don't have--
Patrick rothfuss: Kerrek has no affect in his voice.
Travis: We have to get out of here.
Patrick rothfuss: Up and out.
Marisha: Up and out. Up and out?
Laura: Pike's going to cast Detect Magic and see where it's coming from. Can she see if it's coming from anywhere?
Matt: Okay, she casts Detect Magic. There are a number of magical sources in this room. There are a few vials on the back shelf, some of which appear to have been broken and scattered on the ground, and the magic is fading. There is one book that is actually in a chest that she goes and partially opens, there is a book inside that is emanating some magical essence. There is the doorway across the way. But there is just a general magical presence, like a faint magical energy everywhere in here.
Marisha: Which doorway across the way?
Matt: On the far end.
Patrick rothfuss: There is a doorway.
Travis: Oh, there is?
Marisha: I run over to inspect it.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: Try and get us out of here. Perception?
Matt: Investigation.
Marisha: Oh, jesus fuck.
Taliesin: What hit points am I at right now?
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: Seven. The door looks like-- the door doesn't look like it's particularly intricate.
Marisha: Trapped or anything?
Matt: It looks like it's locked or chained by something.
Marisha: Vax, can you check for traps?
Liam: Grog.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: I'm going to third-level Cure Wounds you.
Liam: Take him, take him.
Taliesin: What am I at right now?
Laura: You're probably at one.
Taliesin: Okay, that'll do.
Laura: So I'm going to Cure Wounds on you.
Liam: All right. I head over to where Keyleth is and start looking for traps.
Patrick rothfuss: Can I Lay on Hands with him once he's back?
Matt: You can now, okay.
Liam: I'm going to use my last Luck of the day.
Patrick rothfuss: So I can give you-- I'll give you 30.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: I just used my last Luck of the day and I got two ones.
Matt: Two ones.
Marisha: Are you fucking serious?
Matt: The door seems, not trapped, but it appears to be chained or locked from the other side.
Travis: Fuck that shit. Titanstone Knuckles. I'm going through the door.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Give him back, give him back.
Matt: All right. Roll a strength check.
Travis: With advantage. That's good. 26.
Liam: But it's not trapped, I checked it.
Laura: 24.
Matt: 26. (punching sounds) You start slamming your fists against the door, and as it splinters and then breaks inward, and then outward, and rocks just start tumbling outward, where once was the door in this vicinity here now appears to be a cave-in on the opposite side.
Marisha: Augh. I do my Stone Shape and I just punch the walls and try and blast a hole through the fallen rubble with Stone Shape.
Matt: Okay. As you slam through, you smash a cylindrical space in, and it just meets more rock. You get the sense that whatever chamber was beyond this room--
Marisha: Is just a cave-in.
Matt: -- has just caved in.
Taliesin: I'm going to say something awful. Put him in the bag of colding. It's not like he's breathing. It will keep him safe. Let's gather what we can. We have to walk out of here. There's no other way.
Laura: Pike looks at the book that's emanating magic. Does it look like it's an evil book at all?
Matt: It has a sinister look to it. It is ancient, the leather itself is darkened not by initial color but by just weather, age. It has a very, very deep leathery-brown burgundy tint to it. It has ancient brass inlays, and it is locked shut on one side.
Laura: Pike's going to take off her scarf and throw it over it and try to cover it and wrap it up in cloth.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And ask Grog to put it in the bag of holding and wonder if that'll make the magic go away.
Travis: Sure.
Taliesin: I'm also just going to grab Grog really quickly and just scrape as much stuff off the shelves into the bags because we need to know what this shit is.
Matt: Okay. So you grab a number of the tomes. A number of them were destroyed from the impact of the Meteor Swarm, but the one-- you get a number of tomes in there, you get some odds and ends, some trinkets, some bones, some other things that're around the territory. And that all seems to go in fine.
Marisha: Keyleth goes over to the corpse of Raishan. She takes the staff of Melora and shoves it down into her corpse. Just to see if any reaction happens.
Matt: Okay. The staff slams into the flesh, one of the exposed wounds on the side of Raishan's body. As it sinks in, the staff seems to right itself in a standing position. You let go instinctually, and you watch as the remaining visual of the black disease that had begun to spread across the body spreads rapidly across the entire body of Raishan. What remains of green scale turns to black, and very very quickly the corpse begins to wither and blacken and then turn to this rippled, fleshy husk. The staff disengages and falls to the ground, clattering against the stone, seeming that the remainder of the disease completed its cycle.
Marisha: I just say, "That was for Scanlan from the Ashari. Bitch."
Taliesin: I'm going to... Grog, help me pile all of the dragon remains into a pile. The eggs. Everything. I need a pile. We're going to try and remove anything useful, especially of the eggs. Anything to know what they were. But I don't want to take the whole thing, I don't want to leave anything. We're going to burn it. We're going to burn it all.
Laura: I take the gate stone and put it back.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Patrick rothfuss: Knock out these pillars, it'll cave this whole thing in.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I still want to burn it, but yeah.
Matt: As you, Kerrek, walk toward one of the edges of the pillars there, there is a flash on the ground, a magical glyph or a symbol of some kind that triggers, and your body is immediately wracked with horrible pain. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Jesus.
Laura: Let's not walk around this place anymore.
Patrick rothfuss: 11.
Matt: 11.
Patrick rothfuss: No no no, wait wait wait, with constitution I get...
Matt: I'll make sure it's constitution.
Patrick rothfuss: Plus seven. 15. 18. I probably should've been making some of these saving throws by adding the right numbers to them.
Liam: Eh, that's D&D, man.
Taliesin: It's math-lite.
Matt: Let me see and make sure it was the right one. Yeah, okay. So as the excruciating pain takes over, you instinctually start screaming as your muscles lock up and you are unable to move. You guys all look over suddenly as Kerrek is just locked in place, all the muscles pulled into this tense moment, just screaming in place.
Travis: Kerr?
Marisha: What is he grabbing onto? Is he grabbing onto something?
Matt: Nothing. He just walked toward one of the pillars--
Taliesin: And hit a glyph.
Matt: In the central area here.
Taliesin: Someone shove him off.
Laura: I'm going to use my Rope of Entanglement and grab him.
Matt: Okay. You pull him off, the glyph still remains glowing in place, and he clatters to the ground, still locked up. You don't even see color or shape right now, it's just white from the pain that is wracking your body. You are unable to move, make conscious thought. You are purely a primal entity that is suffering right now.
Travis: Can you smash glyphs?
Liam: I walk over, I'm going to try--
Patrick rothfuss: Actually, it's not much-- this is almost better than what I had before. (all laugh)
Liam: I kneel down and try Lay on Hands on him, because it can cure multiple diseases and cure poisons with a single use.
Matt: Okay. So you spend five of your hit points.
Liam: Sure, five.
Matt: Doesn't seem to assuage him. Almost biting through his tongue. Allura immediately looks over and is going to attempt to dispel.
Liam: Is he cursed?
Matt: Which succeeds, actually, she rolled a 15 plus-- so. The pain subsides immediately, and she puts her hood back up. As your breath begins to regulate--
Taliesin: Let's get out of here.
Marisha: What was that?
Matt: Dragon left a symbol.
Marisha: A symbol?
Matt: Don't worry about it, it's gone now. Just do not touch that for the next ten minutes.
Taliesin: I'm going to quickly search Scanlan's body for his wand.
Travis: Of Fireballs, or--?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm going to shoot some Fireballs in here when we're on our way out.
Marisha: You're going to burn it to the ground?
Taliesin: I'm going to burn it to the fucking ground.
Marisha: I can help you with that.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: As can I.
Marisha: As we leave, we help burn this motherfucker to the ground.
Matt: All right. As you guys begin to walk out, the three of you, between your staff, your wand, and Allura's preparation, you guys just (fire, explosion sounds). And you watch as elements of the stonework begin to fall into itself and collapse. Not enough to the point where it causes a full cave-in to be endangering to you, but you ensure that this space is no longer used for whatever purpose it was being used for. You guys continue back out to the edge of the chasm where the bridge is currently--
Patrick rothfuss: The bridge got snapped, didn't it?
Matt: It did, yeah.
Taliesin: But the gravity is off.
Patrick rothfuss: Now the gravity's regular.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: We can ferry back and forth on the carpet.
Laura: Yeah, ferry on the carpet and the broom.
Matt: Okay. You get across without issue.
Laura: Pike casts Light on her mace so that it's a nicely lit thing, it's not all creepy and dark.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way across the chasm. You can still hear below, and occasionally as you glance down as the light opens the area below, you can see the masses of writhing bodies that are all reaching up from below, but with no magical gravitational trap in effect, they have no effect and are kept at a distance. You make your way across, heading back towards the spiral staircase upwards. The glyph--
Marisha: Avoiding all that stairs-trap stuff.
Matt: Yeah, the glyph is still dispelled from earlier. You guys still make your way up in sections using your-- the broom and the magic carpet. As you make your way up into the next chamber, you begin to hear cackling laughter.
Marisha: Are these the fucking ghostrider skulls again?
Matt: You hear (cackling) from ahead, and you see a little bit of a light source begin to appear from the iron door room that you guys had your first encounter with--
Marisha: Are they all just like right down--
Matt: They're not quite in sight yet. You can just see the glow as they're descending down a grade.
Marisha: And we're kind of in a hallway, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Are they technically undead?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Then Pike's going to use her-- Yeah, she's going to use Turn Undead on those motherfuckers.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay. Looking at the radius of Turn Undead. I'll just double-check here, because it's pretty close.
Liam: Destroy Undead.
Patrick rothfuss: If she's got it.
Matt: It would be Destroy Undead at fifth level, which she has. But yeah. It's 30 feet near you. So she can wait.
Laura: But they can shoot Fireballs, so maybe that's not smart.
Taliesin: I'll actually say, the second that we see them, I'm just going to empty the wand.
Patrick rothfuss: It's fire, though.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, will they just be fine?
Marisha: Yeah, they're immune to fire. We need radiant damage.
Laura: I'm going to just shoot them with arrows and try to get them from far away, I guess.
Matt: All right. So you guys are holding your action for when they come into range, essentially.
Marisha: Can I see them yet?
Patrick rothfuss: Is this like a straight tunnel, a straight featureless tunnel heading towards us?
Matt: It's a slow grade downward. You guys are heading back up the pathway, and you see them now coming in your direction.
Taliesin: Can I just unload on them, I suppose?
Matt: Once they come into range.
Travis: Is it all four of them?
Matt: You're not sure.
Patrick rothfuss: We just can't clump like we were before.
Marisha: I've got a Sunbeam ready to go.
Taliesin: Oh, well.
Laura: Well, yours has a probably good range on it.
Marisha: 60 foot. But I want to get them in a line.
Laura: I've got 120 feet on my bow.
Taliesin: I've got disgusting range.
Matt: All right, so you guys, hearing the cackling and seeing the glow coming, you hold your actions. You're holding your bow, you're holding a Sunbeam, you're holding your attacks.
Marisha: I'm going to line them up.
Matt: That would give you guys immediate action as soon as they arrive. So. Sure enough, within a moment you watch as four of them come into view, the same four that you destroyed earlier, clustered around. There's two lines of two, essentially. So.
Travis: Do they regenerate?
Laura: So I'm going to do--
Travis: They just grow back? Like, we shattered two of 'em.
Marisha: I have a feeling there's a bunch of these guys.
Travis: Fuck.
Matt: So, Keyleth. Sunbeam can only affect two of them. So they get their saving throw, right? Roll 8d6, if you could. They... (laughs) they do not make their saving throws.
Marisha: That's right. Five, six, need two more.
Taliesin: What do you need?
Marisha: d6s.
Taliesin: That's a lot of whiskey.
Marisha: (counting) 27 radiant damage.
Matt: 27 radiant damage to both of them. All righty. Got you. All right. Percival?
Taliesin: I'm going to try doing a sharpshooter piercing shot on another round of them with the Pepperbox. Sharpshooter piercing shot.
Laura: Pike's going to do Sacred Flame on them, too.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: That's not bad. So that's-- the first shot is--
Marisha: It's good.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Hits.
Taliesin: Oh, then they all hit. That's good. So that's 1d10 plus 1d6, so 1d10 plus 1d6. And this is piercing shot so it's the enemy line, so. Wow. That's nice. That's-- I have no brain. 27 points of damage, with five points of psychic damage for the first shot.
Matt: Okay, so 19 total. They appear-- the blasts of the bullets don't seem to be doing as much damage as other forms of attack.
Taliesin: Okay, but it's hitting both of them in a row.
Matt: Right. Yeah.
Taliesin: Next shot is-- ha! Is 28 points of damage with four points of psychic.
Matt: Okay, this is the ones she damaged with the Sunbeam?
Taliesin: Mm-hm.
Matt: Both of those skulls just (explosion sound). As soon as the beam streaks past, blasting into two of them, two piercing shots in a row, you can watch as their eyes begin to glow, flames glowing within the back of the skull. Two of them immediately just scatter into dust and bone. The two on the other side.
Taliesin: I still have one last shot, so. Let's do slightly less that time. 20 points of damage with one point of psychic.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And that's my contribution to the world.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Pike does Sacred Flame.
Matt: What level?
Laura: She's a 17th level cleric now.
Matt: Right, but what spell level?
Laura: It's a cantrip.
Matt: Oh, that's right.
Laura: So it's just 4d8 damage.
Matt: Okay, yeah.
Taliesin: 4d8 radiant?
Laura: Mm-hm, 4d8 radiant damage. Oh yeah, that's good. 22 radiant damage. They have to do a dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: Cool. So one of them takes 22 damage.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: I'm going to do the one that Percy just hit.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: I hit both of them.
Laura: Oh. Well, there's four of them.
Taliesin: Two are down, the other two are damaged.
Laura: Cool, well, she chooses one. And then I'm going to, as Vex, shoot arrows at them.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: That doesn't hit because the world hates me tonight. And that one hits.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 17 damage.
Matt: All righty. 17 to the one that's over there. Allura, who is frustrated and understanding what their resistances are, she's going to go ahead and cast a high-level Magic Missile.
Taliesin: Classic.
Matt: Okay. That one just explodes and scatters, so now there is one left that is just partially damaged from Percival.
Patrick rothfuss: Are they within 30 feet?
Matt: Not quite yet.
Patrick rothfuss: Then I leave the ring of invisibility off, and I just charge.
Matt: You just charge in?
Patrick rothfuss: I'm heading toward them, because if they hit me and I'm far enough away, it won't hit the whole group.
Matt: Okay. As you go rushing in, that triggers them-- or the one that's remaining to go ahead, and it's going to fire two Fire Rays at you.
Marisha: Fire Rays?
Matt: That is 20 to hit?
Patrick rothfuss: Yes it will.
Matt: And 24 to hit.
Patrick rothfuss: That one won't, strangely enough. No, it did. (all laugh)
Matt: That would be strange.
Marisha: I want that class.
Matt: That is 13 points of fire damage on one.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: And seven points of fire damage on the other.
Patrick rothfuss: I will take that.
Matt: All right. You watch as both eyes streak out these burning rays of flame in his direction. Both blast him in the shoulder, one hits him in the side of the knee and thigh, but Kerrek keeps running forward. You can go ahead and make your attacks if you want.
Patrick rothfuss: 19.
Matt: Hits.
Patrick rothfuss: And-- actually, that's way better than 19, I'm counting dumb. This is 18.
Matt: 18 hits.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay. So for the first one, I'm going to burn one for Divine Smite.
Matt: All righty.
Patrick rothfuss: And these are undead.
Matt: Yes they are.
Patrick rothfuss: Eight... eh. 11. 17. 25.
Matt: 25 for both hits? That's the first one.
Patrick rothfuss: The first hit.
Matt: All right, so do the second hit now.
Patrick rothfuss: And that doesn't do it? Just to make sure I didn't kill it with the first one?
Matt: It doesn't destroy it, no.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, then the second one--
Matt: It does crack the skull and you watch as the sutures cave in from below, the light of your hammer still--
Laura: These are hardy skulls.
Patrick rothfuss: Right, and 12... 22... 23... 31. All radiant.
Matt: 31, that'll do it. With that, the first blow knocks it almost to the ground. As it begins to lift up again, its mouth (cackling), you hit it with the side of the hammer, and it just scatters into broken bone chunks and shards that splatter against the wall and rattle down the grade a bit towards your direction as Kerrek turns around, looking back over his shoulder at you guys, the pathway now clear ahead of you.
Patrick rothfuss: It's matter-of-fact, there was no serpentine, it was like-- and then it was just cutting wood.
Matt: Yeah. You guys continue forward. You make your way to the chamber with the iron door, still open, eventually walking to the outskirts of the entranceway to the sanctum. You now walk carefully around the previously noticed patches of dirt and sand.
Laura: Oh, I grab those immovable rods when we get out of there.
Matt: Right. And as you pull them out, it seals the tunnel once more behind you.
Liam: Let's find a tree.
Travis: Yeah, how do we go?
Marisha: Allura, do you have any more teleportations left?
Matt: No, that was the one.
Marisha: Let's find a big ol' tree, then. I'll burn my seventh-level spell.
Liam: Do we see any trees? Everything was dead the closer we got to the central--
Marisha: We have to get to a living tree that we can all fit through.
Matt: Actually, she goes, "I do have a teleportation circle, so I may be able to bring us to Emon."
Marisha: Do we want to go to Emon or anywhere else?
Laura: We can go to Greyskull Keep.
Travis: Why, what's there?
Marisha: Can you get us to Greyskull Keep, or at least the--
Travis: We need something that'll get Scanlan. What's the quickest--
Laura: Sarenrae's temple.
Travis: Is at Greyskull Keep, or--
Laura: I mean, that's where our chapel is in our house.
Marisha: Pike and I have a little temple, yeah.
Travis: Oh, right.
Matt: That's one of the few teleportation sigils that still exist, in that vicinity at least.
Travis: Yeah, do it, do it. Yeah.
Marisha: If it doesn't work at Sarenrae's temple, I can use a treestride to get us elsewhere. Let's get to Greyskull Keep.
Matt: "All right." She gets down and begins marking out the symbol on the ground on the outskirts. She finishes, you watch the arcane flash.
Travis: No. No. No.
Matt: She steps onto the circle and vanishes. The teleportation circle. And Kima's about to go behind her, and Kima goes, "I don't... it doesn't usually look like that."
Marisha: What? Allura didn't vanish, did she?
Matt: Allura stepped onto it after casting it and then vanished. There was a weird sparkle of electrical energy.
Travis: What do you mean, it doesn't look like that normally?
Matt: I don't know. I don't know!
Marisha: Do we follow or do something else?
Laura: I don't understand. No, Kima!
Marisha: Kima!
Matt: And Kima just walks in after her. Sparks once more.
Laura: Does anybody know what the fuck--
Travis: What did that mean?
Laura: What was that supposed to look like? What it was supposed to look like?
Marisha: Can we do some sort of check?
Patrick rothfuss: I don't know arcane.
Marisha: I don't either.
Laura: (tearfully) Scanlan does.
Marisha: (tearfully) Scanlan does. He would know.
Matt: You can make an arcana check.
Taliesin: I'd love to make an arcana check.
Marisha: For Scanlan!
Patrick rothfuss: I'll roll the bones in case it's a religious thing.
Laura: I mean, as perception thing, if we've seen a teleportation circle before, would we at least know that it doesn't look like it's supposed to?
Marisha: (yells) Nothing. I don't know shit.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: As you get closer and look at it-- you've seen a few teleportation circles, and once they're down they just kind of glow with this mild energy until they dissipate. Which is pretty rapid. Let's see here.
Travis: We need those two, right, to do what we need to do. We have to go with them.
Taliesin: We don't.
Laura: We don't.
Marisha: I can get us there via tree. If we need to. There's a tree in Sarenrae's--
Travis: You'd better be right. If we leave those two behind.
Matt: Yeah, it only lasts for a round, so it's--
Taliesin: Six seconds.
Matt: Yeah, six seconds.
Laura: So we have to make this decision stat?
Matt: Now.
Laura: But what if it took them somewhere--
Matt: You glancing at it, there is a flicker to it and weird (crackling), very similar to the weird flash that you saw when you were inside and attempted the original teleportation. There's something-- you get the sense that there's something about this-- either this mountain or this underground area, there's something that has some sort of influence or impact on any sort of transportation magic.
Marisha: Who knows where they just got teleported to?
Patrick rothfuss: Or if they ended up anywhere at all.
Travis: Do we need them?
Liam: I mean, the amount of talking we're doing, it's already closed at this point.
Matt: It's gone.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Fuck.
Travis: Go find a tree. We all start running.
Marisha: No no no.
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: Yeah, we find a tree, we find a tree.
Taliesin: We go to the beach and we find a tree. We get as far away from this cave.
Patrick rothfuss: As far away.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: What if-- where did they just go? What if we just sent them to some plane of existence?
Marisha: I don't know. I can try to scry on them. I can try and scry on them and see, but that's going to take time.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, now.
Taliesin: One crisis at a time.
Liam: We just start walking. Grog and I start walking.
Taliesin: We start walking to the beach.
Marisha: Can I scry while we're walking?
Matt: The ritual requires you--
Taliesin: The ball.
Laura: What about the ball?
Marisha: Can I get a piggyback from Grog and scry while we're walking?
Taliesin: On the carpet.
Laura: Yeah, on the carpet.
Matt: You could probably try that. I'd give you a concentration check to maintain it for the duration.
Marisha: Let's do it, let's do it.
Taliesin: I'm going to take a rest on the carpet and I'm going to fly the carpet while you do your thing.
Travis: Vax and I are still walking.
Marisha: I'm going to cast-- I haven't burned any fifth-level spells, I'm going to scry.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Pike's going to cast healing on people.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: She might want to save-- well. We'll see. Seems like we know where--
Matt: Okay.
Patrick rothfuss: Whoever's low. I know some people are pretty low.
Marisha: I'm really low.
Laura: Everybody's low, super low.
Matt: You guys slowly make your way through the forest, avoiding the patches that you noticed before, the weird collapsing earth.
Marisha: I'm just laying back on the carpet in a trust-state as they guide me.
Matt: Go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, Keyleth.
Marisha: Just straight constitution?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: 15, okay.
Marisha: No no no, 17. Plus five.
Matt: What are you focusing on?
Marisha: Allura.
Matt: Allura? Okay.
Marisha: Oh no. Oh no.
Matt: Okay. So. You focus on Allura's life force, form, face, and as you close your eyes, slowly moving along with the gradual movement of the flying carpet, your vision pulls out of you and above. An island. It then shifts suddenly and pulls you over blue. Over water. And then there's another flash, and there's nothing but water around you. You don't know where you are, you don't know where it is, and it flashes once more. And there in the center of this open expanse of water and ocean, you see two figures swimming. And you glance down and there in the middle of the ocean waters you see Allura treading water, shouting Kima's name. "Kima!" And looking across the way, you can just barely hear in the distance, "Allie, I'm coming!" She swims over in that direction. They eventually grab each other's hands and together hold each other and look around, keeping treading water, as the sun is slowly beginning to set in the distance and nightfall comes. You just see Allura holding her there, trying to keep both aloft. "It's all right. We're alive. I don't know where we are. But we'll figure this out. We'll figure this out." And they both begin swimming, looking at the direction of the sun and picking what looks to be a northern position. And then the scry--
Marisha: Do I see any land, is there an island?
Matt: You cannot see-- the scrying is specifically on her. But they are both just plopped somewhere in the ocean.
Laura: If we would've gone through...
Taliesin: We would've been in trouble.
Liam: Drowning.
Laura: Well no, we have the fucking magic carpet.
Taliesin: That can't hold all of us.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: I tell them what happened when I wake up. I don't even know where they could be. They're in the middle of the ocean, they could be right off the coast or hundreds of miles from here. This ocean...
Taliesin: This is fine. We're going to go to Whitestone now, we're not going to go to Greyskull, and we're going to get Gilmore's help.
Liam: Gilmore, yes.
Marisha: But they're our friends, are we just going to leave them behind?
Taliesin: We're going to get Gilmore's help.
Travis: One thing at a time.
Liam: That's right. That's right.
Marisha: I mean. Keyleth starts hyperventilating, panicking a little bit.
Laura: Keyleth. We need you right now.
Marisha: They're okay, right? Allura will figure it out, right?
Laura: She'll figure it out. She's so powerful.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: One thing at a time.
Marisha: This is taking everything to not stay here. Okay.
Travis: Still moving towards the beach, looking for live trees.
Matt: A short time later, you eventually get close to the edge of the waterline, and you do find a handful of trees that appear to be alive enough and large enough to maintain one of your spells.
Marisha: I do a useless scan of the ocean out of desperation to see if I see anything.
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Laura: (gasps)
Marisha: It's true. It was a Gil dice, it was Gil's dice. You can see, you can see.
Matt: And add your perception bonus?
Marisha: 31.
Matt: 31.
Marisha: Perception's 11.
Matt: You take a moment, and you don't know if it's the sense of the scry spell and something about the arcane winds that blow through the ley lines of magic that traverse across Exandria, but something guides your attention that way, and you focus real hard, and you see just at the horizon what looks to be a very, very faint speck of movement.
Travis: Shut the fuck up.
Marisha: There they are! Oh, shit--
Laura: I take off on the broom.
Marisha: I don't know if that's them, I think that's them!
Taliesin: No, wait.
Patrick rothfuss: Kerrek puts his hand on her shoulder and says, "Oh, child."
Laura: I take off on the broom, I'm out. In the direction that she went.
Patrick rothfuss: Wishing doesn't make it so.
Marisha: No, I know. I know, but look! Look! There's something. It could be something else, but it's something.
Taliesin: Keyleth--
Laura: Yeah, I'm going, I'm going. I went.
Matt: You, arcing as fast as you can on the broom, full speed, holding on to the hat as best you can. The wind of the ocean air coming past your face, the salt and the briny spray of bits of reef and rock that surround the island--
Marisha: I'm trying to give Vex over the earpiece like a, Warmer, warmer, warmer, colder, a little-- ten degrees to your left.
Matt: Yeah, you do look out and you see both Kima and Allura swimming through the ocean, exhausted and it looks like, based on both the heavy armor that Kima's wearing and their general physical state, they're both having a hard time treading water, and they're swimming in the wrong direction.
Laura: I fly over them and just tell them, "Hang onto the broom!"
Matt: "Oh, that's the best thing I could've hoped for seeing." And Allura reaches up and grabs your arm and says, "Kima, hold on!" And grabs the edge. You can see Kima now is like coughing up water and is trying desperately to tread water. That's a natural 20 on a strength check for Allura. Holy shit. With no modifier. Manages to hold onto both you and Kima and keep you up. I need you to make an athletics check. Just to hold on.
Laura: 13?
Matt: 13, okay. It's enough to maintain. Carrying them both back as fast as the broom-- which is not very fast at this time. It takes you probably a good 15 or so minutes, and as the tension's going on you can see Allura getting more and more exhausted.
Laura: Keep holding, we're almost there, darling.
Matt: I'm trying.
Marisha: I just keep saying, "Vex? Did you find them?"
Taliesin: I'm taking the carpet that direction.
Marisha: Vex?
Patrick rothfuss: If it's been this long, Kerrek has given The Talk, like.
Marisha: I'm just crying in Kerrek's shoulder right now, just bawling my eyes out.
Taliesin: "I'll be back in a moment." I'm taking the carpet towards the speck I see on the-- and probably ten minutes in is where, I would have given it ten minutes. I'm on the way with the carpet.
Laura: I have them.
Marisha: I swear I saw them, I swear.
Matt: At this point, you can see Allura's grip is getting shaky on the broom now. She says, "We're almost close enough. Now." And then her and Kima vanish in a puff of dark bluish energy and appear on the carpet next to you through dimension door.
Taliesin: (yelps) I'm so tired.
Marisha: Still sobbing into Kerrek's shoulder.
Patrick rothfuss: It's been a slow litany of, sometimes people go and you never get them back. It's, he's giving you the wrong pep talk.
Marisha: Oh god. So wait, maybe they were just dead and I saw their ghosts?
Laura: We have them! We have them!
Marisha: What? And I just cry harder.
Liam: Vax is also listening to that, sometimes you cannot get them back, while holding Scanlan.
Laura: (wailing) Like little Dobby in Harry Potter.
Matt: Eventually you guys manage to gather the rest of your party at the beachside. Waterlogged, Kima shakes it out, leaving this trail as her hair's all matted and into her face, and she just looks really pissed and is like, "Not a word." Allura's squeezing out the sides of her braids. "Well, now what?"
Laura: Whitestone.
Marisha: Let's take a tree, shall we?
Matt: Let's try. I think this definitely explains why so many folks who went to investigate this place never came back.
Patrick rothfuss: Are we as far away as we can be, like, we came in on a tree, right?
Travis: We're on the beach.
Matt: You came in on a tree, yes.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Taliesin: That doesn't mean a lot, but yeah. We're as far as we can get.
Matt: So you go ahead and find the tree? All right. Hm. As you reach out and touch the side of the tree, eyes clenched tight, hoping that this is enough, you watch as the bark splits into the transportation via plants portal, and as it splits apart, you can see further internal wood striations, those split. A third layer splits, it's having to force its way through this tree, and finally it divides out and you can see the sunset-lit outside of the center of Whitestone.
Taliesin: Oh, thank god.
Marisha: I hold the door open like it's a closing elevator. Am I sure it's fucking Whitestone?
Matt: It appears to be Whitestone.
Laura: We've got six seconds, go!
Marisha: Go!
Taliesin: I'm running for it.
Matt: You guys all charge through, making your way through the portal.
Marisha: And I go in last.
Matt: You all step out, catching yourself, just as the tree slams behind you. There you see the faintly blossoming branches of the Sun Tree greeting you to the center of sunsetting Whitestone, together as a group, clutching Scanlan's lifeless body in your arms still, Vax. What do you do?
Marisha: I cry to Kerr a little bit more.
Travis: No, no time for that.
Taliesin: No time.
Laura: Get him to the castle.
Marisha: Okay, sorry.
Laura: Right?
Marisha: No, should we get him to the castle or the Raven Queen's temple?
Liam: To the temple of the Raven Queen.
Marisha: Okay, to the temple, to the temple.
Taliesin: Scry-- find his daughter. Scry on his daughter.
Marisha: Okay. I use my-- oh jeez. I can't remember-- no, I didn't use any of my Scrying Eye on Raishan at all, right?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: That was my spell just now. I will use my Scrying Eye now to see if I can find Kaylie.
Liam: I'm already 50 feet towards the temple.
Matt: Okay. You guys all make your way towards the temple of the Raven Queen and the graveyard outside of Whitestone. As you're making this scry attempt with the item, go ahead and make another concentration check as you're moving along and doing this on the carpet.
Marisha: That's cocked. That's not bad. Just a regular-- what do I use?
Matt: It's a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: Con saving throw? Then 16.
Matt: Remember, you have warcaster, so you technically have advantage on concentration, too.
Marisha: Oh my god, oh my god.
Matt: Don't forget that.
Marisha: No, 16.
Matt: Okay. Little bit of a show. Okay. Your vision pulls back and is dragged fast enough through the clouds to have no sense of direction. Suddenly you feel your essence thrust downward through the clouds once more towards the closing daylight around Kymal in the center of Tal'Dorei.
Marisha: She's in Kymal.
Matt: Looking down to the rather dirty, destitute, gambling-overrun and light-law-enforced city that Kymal is, you're pulled once more into what looks to be a tavern room, and there you see a makeshift band of very terrible performers playing, and at the back table you see Kaylie with half a flagon of ale sitting there, dagger on the table, just staring and just giving those performers shit, she's like, "You all fucking suck, you know that?"
Marisha: Oh, I love her so much right now.
Matt: Where I come from, they'd kill you for this. That's terrible. Certainly.
Marisha: Knowing how scrying works, and knowing that certain magic-casters can feel it-- This is going on a limb. I just yell through the scrying and audibly amongst everyone, "Kaylie! It's Scanlan!" Trying to push through the magical boundary and see if I can at least get a reaction out of her.
Matt: Okay. You're shouting this, you guys hear her doing this, and you just keep pushing forward, occasionally checking to make sure she's okay. Kaylie just keeps drinking from the flagon and is shouting out, someone comes by and you watch as she deftly nabs a little bit of coin from the pocket--
Marisha: And I scream again, "Kaylie!"
Matt: Doesn't seem to be having an effect.
Taliesin: Kymal.
Marisha: God damn it, I wish you could talk to people through scrying sometimes.
Laura: Who can send me there?
Marisha: She's in Kymal.
Laura: Who can send me there? I'll go.
Marisha: Allura might be able to send her a message. Allura, do you still have any messages left?
Matt: I can cast Sending, yes.
Marisha: Has she ever met Kaylie?
Laura: I don't think so.
Liam: No.
Laura: We need to get her and bring her here.
Liam: Can we get the other gate stone and find Shaun.
Laura: I've got the gate stone, yes.
Liam: We have both of them, we have them?
Taliesin: No, we have the one gate stone.
Liam: Yeah, doesn't your sister have the other one?
Taliesin: She has the other one.
Liam: Yes, find the other gate stone and find Shaun.
Laura: Find the other gate stone. I take off to find Gilmore.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I will go get the other gate stone.
Marisha: I'm tapped out of teleportations.
Taliesin: It's fine. We can make this work. And in the meantime, take him to the Raven Queen temple.
Matt: And so is Allura.
Marisha: Tapped out of teleportation?
Matt: Yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: Now, from what I know about the Raven Queen, she is not like, oh, you can get a do-over, right?
Laura: No.
Patrick rothfuss: She is like, you are dead and that is the line you do not cross to not come back.
Liam: It's a little more complicated.
Laura: Well, he is her champion.
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah, but from what I know.
Matt: From what you know as Kerrek? Yeah, she's--
Patrick rothfuss: She's the one that fucking holds this line. Like, you do not come back.
Matt: She guides you. One way or the other. She's the mistress of fate, and if your destiny is cut short, there is exception.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, okay.
Matt: However, her real loathing is for those people who go against that natural destiny.
Patrick rothfuss: That abrogate the natural order.
Matt: Exactly.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, right.
Matt: Unnatural, unexpected death across one's fate line is unfortunate, but it can be corrected.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, okay.
Matt: So. You go ahead and you look for Gilmore? You find Gilmore with a big mug of coffee in his comfort robes, still recovering from the war the previous day, his hair's tousled up and he's sitting there cradling it, looking out as the sun's setting in the main common mess area of the castle, and as you walk in. "Oh, Vex'ahlia, you return!"
Laura: I just run straight up. "Darling."
Matt: Yes, yes?
Laura: Do you have teleportation? Do you have anything that can send me to Kymal. Kymal?
Liam: Kymal.
Laura: To Kymal.
Marisha: In a tavern in Kymal.
Matt: I-- (nervous chuckle)
Laura: Please.
Matt: I don't know of a sigil there, I'm sorry. I normally don't frequent places like that. It's a bit dastardly for my tastes. I-- I'm sorry.
Laura: (tearfully) Do you know of a city nearby? Anything?
Matt: I mean, there's Westruun, but that sigil got destroyed too. What's wrong?
Laura: (tearfully) I don't know what to do. Scanlan's down. We have to find his daughter.
Matt: Puts his mug down and stands up slowly. His demeanor gets very stoic and very dark. "Well. Let's see what we can do. Follow me." And he begins walking down and leads you towards the home that he's been staying here in Whitestone. He goes in, and it's barely furnished based on the original attack on Whitestone when you guys had the assassins that came after you here. It's been cleaned up but it hasn't been replaced. He goes rummaging through some things up in his room, he goes through a few bags and goes, "I don't really have many options. Is it a--"
Laura: I just need to get there.
Matt: Have you talked to Allura?
Laura: She's out. Out of spells.
Matt: "Hold on." And he leads you back up to the castle. What are you guys doing?
Liam: All this time, I have laid Scanlan down in the center of the temple, and with a wet rag I have cleaned his face and combed his hair out and laid Mythcarver out next to him.
Laura: Probably gave him some clean pants because he's covered in piss.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, you've got to scrub that down a little.
Travis: I'm waiting outside the temple because I probably can't go in. Right? I can't go in there.
Laura: Why?
Travis: I don't know. I'm just me.
Liam: While I'm cleaning, I start talking as well. You know, if it is his time, then I can accept that it is his time. But he just did an awful lot for you. That dragon was tampering with your ways, and without him we would have not gotten as far as we have. He has done a lot for you, and this isn't even bargaining anymore. I am yours. I'm not bargaining. But this little man has more heart in his chest than any man I've met. And if there is anyone who deserves a second chance... I don't know, I don't know. Your will be done.
Marisha: I grab Grog on the outside of the temple, also standing outside, and I just grab him by his massive gigantic shoulder and say, You were closer to him than probably anyone else in this group, you knew more of his secrets than anyone else. I think it would mean something if you talked to him from beyond.
Travis: How do I do that?
Marisha: His spirit still holds on. You can still speak to his spirit and convince it to come back. Convince it to come back, Grog. You knew him. You knew him. Look inside and you will know.
Travis: What, I just start talking to him?
Marisha: And I crack the door to the temple open and try and gesture him in.
Travis: Oh, in there. I'm not really religious, though, like. I don't--
Marisha: You don't have to be religious. You had the connection with Scanlan, and you have heart. That connection speaks far stronger than any religion ever could. It's up to you. We don't know if Kaylie will make it.
Travis: Right. Okay. For Scanlan, then. And I go into the temple of the Raven Queen.
Matt: Okay. Are you guys having Pike prepare the Resurrection ritual, is that what's going on?
Laura: I guess so.
Matt: I don't know what's happening. You guys are talking to air right now.
Marisha: Well, I was talking to Grog.
Matt: Right, right, right.
Taliesin: Trying to put together the Resurrection ritual.
Matt: Okay, that's what I thought.
Laura: Trying to prepare that, yeah.
Liam: I wasn't expecting-- that wasn't part of the ritual.
Matt: Right, right.
Patrick rothfuss: So everybody here is a mess, right? And when they brought them out of the ocean, Kerrek was like-- because that shook him, you know? Because he knew at this point, now is the point where all your friends die. But these guys I can't talk to, they are all messed-- how bad are you?
Taliesin: Outwardly I'm fine.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm in get-shit-done mode.
Patrick rothfuss: Right. I get you a little aside.
Taliesin: I'm probably coming back down now from the castle with the stone.
Patrick rothfuss: What-- can his sister do something, or his daughter?
Taliesin: His daughter.
Patrick rothfuss: Why-- why the urgency, I mean?
Taliesin: Because it's the only thing I can think of that could really drag him back from wherever he is. That's my thought. I've been there, I've experienced this.
Patrick rothfuss: Been where?
Taliesin: I've died. And you need to... it's not easy. And you need to-- not everything cuts through. You need to find the right thing to cut through, and I think this might be it. So it's where I'm putting my bets.
Matt: Allura approaches and says, "If we can wait until tomorrow, I can take us there, but-- I just, I have no means of--"
Marisha: What about--
Laura: I feel like it's bad to wait.
Marisha: Oh jeez, I don't know his name.
Matt: Vex, as you're brought up to the castle, Gilmore is tugging your arm, and you see he has a haste to him, and he's like, "Where's Eskil? Where's Eskil? Has he returned? Please, somebody, give me this answer. Anyone." And you watch as some of the guards come up and like, "Eskil's been back in his research at the ziggurat for the better part of a week, now."
Taliesin: Guards, you're with Gilmore, you will get him into any room in the castle immediately without question.
Matt: Yes sir, yes sir.
Taliesin: Now.
Matt: Pulls you down, and you rush down past the Ziggurat, and Eskil's returning with his servant. This older hunched form. It looks like they finished their work for the day and, as you all begin rushing down the hall to the ziggurat beneath Whitestone, he says, "Oh, hello. We're finished, there's no reason to--"
Laura: Teleportation.
Matt: It's a very strange, very--
Laura: Shaun.
Matt: -- unique magic, yes, of course.
Laura: Can you do it?
Matt: Peh. Child's play, really.
Laura: Then can you send me to Kymal, please?
Matt: Kymal?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Why would you want to--
Laura: Urgently, darling.
Matt: "Shaun--" Shaun kind of goes, "If you want to be of use to anybody right now, buddy, this is the way to do it." (sputters) "Kymal. All right. Heh, that's a one- way trip, so you're paying for room and board."
Laura: "Sure." I give Shaun a kiss on the cheek.
Matt: All right. Have you guys caught up at this point?
Taliesin: I'm at the temple, I've sent them off to deal with this.
Matt: All right. So we go-- what are you looking for?
Laura: I'm looking for a tavern, probably the only one in town.
Matt: All right, I'll take you there, and that's where we're staying for the night. We'll return tomorrow.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "All right. (sighs) It's been a while." And he reaches out and grabs your hand. "Be back in a day!" And begins doing this incantation. As he traces his fingers through the air, you watch these lines begin to connect, and he's tracing almost this mystical map of the portions of Tal'Dorei, and as each finger hits a point you see him connect a thread. As he connects a thread, both of you blink out and appear in the middle of this busy cobblestone street. You can hear what sounds like raucous laughter and shouting in the distance from two different directions. You can see now as the night has gone from a bright orange and purple to the dark reds and blues of post-sunset. There are a couple of what look to be guards wandering the street, but they themselves look to be laughing and probably a little tipsy in their own right. You see many humans, and you see a couple of half-orcs. You actually see two gnolls and what looks to be a goblin that are wandering amongst those people in the street. Kymal is, and you've passed through before. Kymal is-- it's the real-- it's the seedy Reno of Tal'Dorei, if you will.
Marisha: I mean, Reno's already pretty seedy, so.
Matt: It's not Laughlin level. It's not-- sorry, Laughlin.
Marisha: Sorry, Reno.
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Laura: I'm just terrified of all my dice.
Liam: High rolls.
Laura: 16?
Matt: 16, okay.
Laura: Wait, but I didn't add anything to that. Investigation... that's a 23.
Matt: Okay, yeah. Asking questions rapidly around, dragging Eskil behind, he's like, "Where are we going? (grumbling)" Asking to where the worst performers you've seen perform in this town, and everyone keeps pointing you to this one place that's up on this one hill towards the back of the Ironseat Ridge, which is the mountain that Kymal is up against. As you walk into the tavern, you see a little more than a dozen people in various clusters. Some of them are ready to go, they've been drinking since sundown and they're already pretty sauced. There's a terrible off-key band in the corner of four people, three gentlemen and a lady--
Taliesin: Terrible band name.
Matt: It's a terrible band name. And it's pretty bad. And there you see, half-slumped over in the corner at the table, you see Kaylie, just ready to pass out at the end.
Laura: Fuck. Stay by the bar. I'll be right back.
Matt: Should I get our rooms?
Laura: Fine. Yes, darling.
Matt: One room-- two rooms, she's paying, hold on.
Laura: And I run off.
Matt: And he walks over towards the bar.
Liam: He's going to be so pissed.
Marisha: Yeah he is, he's going to be so pissed.
Patrick rothfuss: Ditch him.
Marisha: I so approve of this, by the way. This is the way to do this. Okay, byeeee.
Liam: Sorry!
Marisha: Sorry!
Matt: Kaylie at the table.
Laura: Kaylie.
Matt: What do you want from me.
Laura: I smack her across the cheek.
Matt: "You--" She grabs the dagger and grabs you by the front of the shirt and brings it--
Laura: Darling, your father! Scanlan. Tell me you're sober.
Matt: Oh, I remember you.
Laura: Are you sober?
Matt: I'm never sober.
Laura: Ah, fuck. Your father's hurt.
Matt: I don't want to deal with him right now. Tell him-- look.
Laura: "Kaylie!" And I pick her up and bring her up to my eye-level.
Matt: I will kick your ass right now if you keep treating me like this.
Laura: Your father. He died. But there's a chance we can bring him back, if you're willing to help.
Matt: "How'd he die?" And she's still being held up, reaches over and grabs her tankard. Her feet still dangling.
Laura: Defending everyone. Saving the fucking land, can you believe it?
Matt: Who would want a death like that?
Laura: He died with piss all over him.
Matt: That sounds like my father.
Laura: Will you go?
Matt: And what?
Laura: Will you help? Kaylie.
Matt: And help what?
Laura: I set her on the table so we're still eye-level. All his words were of you. Look, I know a little bit about having a father who wasn't around. Right? Take it from me. It's not worth it. It's not worth harboring this hatred in your heart. If you can find it in yourself to forgive him, you'll live a much happier life.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Patrick rothfuss: (singing) My father wasn't around...
Laura: (singing) My father wasn't around...
Marisha: (singing) My father wasn't around...
Marisha: Come on, Vex, come on.
Laura: 25.
Matt: She looks at you for a second. You can see her kind of frustrated piss-off facade drops a little and her eyes sink below. "I really don't know what you think I can do, but, I mean. At the very least, I'd like to see his body before it's interred."
Laura: I pull out the stone and I put it in her hand. Concentrate. Concentrate on him. It'll bring you to him, I swear.
Matt: (sighs) So much strangeness surrounds you folks every time I cross paths with you, it seems.
Laura: Please. Kaylie.
Matt: Can I take my drink?
Laura: You can take whatever you want. Just promise me you'll try.
Matt: She holds the stone for a second and looks at it. Squints an eye. "Listen, if you're trying to take the piss out of me--" And her form just vanishes from the table. It is pushing 11:20. I think we will pick this up right there next week here in Whitestone for the ritual.
Liam: All night long, man, all night long.
Matt: I'm trying to push the narrative as long as I can get, trying to get to a point, but yeah, this is building and I don't want to drag us in here.
Laura: It's just going.
Marisha: Gah, it's going to be another Percy situation.
Matt: I know.
Marisha: Scanlan's going to be dead for a week.
Matt: I can't force narrative.
Marisha: Schrodinger's Scanlan.
Matt: Can't force narrative. All right, well, we will pick this up next week.
Taliesin: Ironically of course, also, I don't think we have Sam next week.
Marisha: Sam won't be here!
Laura: Yeah, he's not here next--
Matt: Sam can't be here next week. Oh, that's going to be interesting.
Liam: Push the narrative all night long like Lionel Ritchie, come on.
Sam: Get used to it! (all laugh)
Laura: No, Sam!
Matt: Oh, snap.
Taliesin: Dick!
Liam: If we wait, he's going to write us off.
Travis: I hear him! I hear him from beyond!
Laura: See, Grog? See?
Matt: All right, well, we'll figure it out. If worse comes to worst, I'll play him, or we'll see if he can Skype in. We'll see. I don't know what he's doing. I know he's gone. Like a tool.
Marisha: Oh yeah, maybe he can Skype in.
Taliesin: We can totally, like Zod in the mirror.
Matt: That's true. All right, well. With that, the Conclave lies destroyed.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: (whoops)
Matt: Raishan's plot still not uncovered. One of two deaths reversed, one still on the line. The tethering of the soul to the body withering with each fall. And a surprisingly low-level paladin getting the final blow on an ancient green dragon.
Laura: Nice!
Taliesin: Way to David that goliath, man.
Laura: Yeah, right?
Marisha: Like, legit, we were all talking, we thought you were going to die.
Patrick rothfuss: Why do you think I showed up?
Taliesin: We were like, I wonder if he's going to totally Coulson, I wonder if he's just going to Coulson on us.
Marisha: We thought you were going to be our Agent Coulson, yeah.
Matt: I honestly prepared that to be this-- like, we talked about that on the break, it would've been an awesome heroic end to the story.
Patrick rothfuss: That's why I was here. I was going to throw my body in front of someone.
Matt: It just happened to work out that she was pinned straight to the side--
Travis: Well, you didn't do a very good job of it, Patrick.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, believe me, Kerrek much would've rather died than have this particular outcome.
Marisha: Shoot for the moon, sometimes you'll land at the how do you want to do this.
Matt: I like that.
Liam: Also, Feeblemind? Natural 20 on scanning the ocean?
Laura: Pretty fucking great.
Liam: Pretty amazing.
Matt: Yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: That was...
Marisha: I had a few lucky rolls.
Laura: Keyleth and Kerr MVPs for sure.
Taliesin: Somebody conquered some personal demons, this week.
Marisha: Yeah, I was waiting for this.
Matt: Well, Sam, we love you. Wherever you are.
Taliesin: You're still an awkward mess, but you know.
Marisha: Keyleth will always be an awkward mess. As much character growth as you can have, you're still always you.
Taliesin: There will always be a pit of fire.
Marisha: She will always be awkward. I will always trip and fall and faceplant in lava.
Taliesin: It's beautiful.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Tonight's gonna be a fun one. But before we jump into it--
Liam: What does that mean? What does that mean?
Matt: I don't know. We ended on an interesting note.
Marisha: I think I just peed a little.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Do y'all hear that heartbeat in your ears?
Matt: It's weird.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: (heartbeat noise) But before we get to that, let's go ahead and get to our opening announcements. First and foremost, our glorious returning sponsor for the evening, our friends at Loot Crate!
All: Loot Crate!
Matt: Fantastic, awesome people. Sam, is there something you want to talk about?
Sam: Yeah. You know, a lot of my Loot Crate plugs have been comedic, or cute. Some would say clever.
Taliesin: Debatable.
Travis: I don't know if I'd go that far.
Sam: But one thing that has been lacking is a sense of spectacle. Of human achievement. Of record breaking. So tonight I'm going to attempt something that's never been attempted before. I'm going to do the Loot Crate copy read here. While drinking an entire Coca-Cola.
Liam: Oh no.
Sam: And a bite-sized 100 Grand bar, Snickers bar, Milky Way, Twix, another bite-sized Snickers bar, a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, and a packet of Big League Chew.
Travis: Yes!
Liam: Oh no.
Laura: What? You're going to vomit.
Sam: In two minutes.
Laura: You're going to vomit, Sam.
Sam: Also, all this stuff melted in my car.
Liam: Notice he's got a towel down.
Marisha: That's actually really gross-looking.
Laura: Oh god! He does have a towel down.
Taliesin: This looks unhappy.
Sam: All right. Travis?
Travis: Yeah yeah.
Sam: You got the clock ready?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Two minutes, can it be done? The answer is no. (laughs) Ready?
Travis: Three, two, one.
Sam: Loot Crate is a curated collection of awesome items from the best pop culture franchises delivered to your door every month. You get the best and most exclusive licensed figures, t-shirts, home goods, and more.
Laura: Oh no.
Travis: You're doing good. You're doing good.
Liam: My god.
Laura: He's going to spew.
Marisha: At least it's a Mexico--
Travis: No, no, don't help him.
Taliesin: Let it happen! Let it happen!
Sam: Don't help me!
Marisha: No, we're good. It's better. It's better.
Sam: This week's crate theme is Primal. Featuring awesome swag from X-Men, Overwatch and Predator.
Travis: 30 seconds.
Sam: Give yourself every month or give the gift of geeking out to a friend or loved one. And if you visit lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the coupon code 'criticalrole', you'll get 10% off your Loot Crate monthly geek crate.
Laura: Don't do it!
Taliesin: Big League Chew! No god!
Sam: From collectibles [inaudible]. It's like Comic-Con in a box!
Travis: One minute.
Sam: Oh boy! How do I separate the gum from the other stuff? Loot Crate, Loot Crate DX, Loot Gaming, and Loot Anime. How do you want to do this?
Laura: Did you do it? Did he just do it?
Taliesin: No, no, no.
Matt: He's still got more Coke.
Travis: The Coke's gotta go.
Taliesin: Gotta go!
Sam: It can't get in.
Travis: 30 seconds left! 30 seconds left! Work it. Work! Relax the throat.
Sam: Hold on. Not good.
Laura: He's going to kill himself.
Marisha: Don't choke.
Sam: Half left?!
Travis: 15 seconds.
Laura: Sam, get that shit out of your mouth. I'm going to throw up.
Sam: I can't do it! I can't do it!
Taliesin: Don't look!
Matt: 11!
Travis: Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Don't stop fighting for it!
Taliesin: No matter what, we're going to think less of you, it doesn't matter anymore.
Travis: Three! Two! One!
Liam: Happy new year!
Travis: That's it! That's it! That's it! Oh my god, that's it.
Taliesin: You get a participation ribbon. Well done.
Laura: That was so fucking gross. Samuel!
Travis: Do we have an ambulance on standby?
Taliesin: Five years from now, your children will be able to Google this. I'm just going to remind you.
Matt: If there was ever a moment in our show that will be giffed and show up on GIPHY, that's it right there. Thank you, Sam. And thank you, Loot Crate, for your fantastic sponsorship.
Liam: I feel like we just passed into performance art, there.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Don't forget to use the code 'criticalrole' for 10% off your Loot Crate monthly geek crate.
Travis: That entire tooth is brown.
Laura: I'm just going to throw up.
Travis: Your teeth are all brown!
Laura: It's so gross.
Matt: I feel like that's an opening act to Gaga's next tour.
Liam: Listen, real art makes you uncomfortable and challenges you.
Travis: The Super Bowl was missing that.
Matt: Consider us challenged and uncomfortable.
Marisha: That made my eyes water and not in a good way.
Travis: There's a part of the back of my head that's cramped.
Matt: Thank you Sam.
Taliesin: I'm no longer thinking about the game. Well done. Yeah, not even thinking a little bit about the game.
Matt: All right.
Sam: I'll take care of this.
Taliesin: Just roll it up and burn it.
Marisha: Do you wanna handle that?
Taliesin: You gonna finish that Coke?
Sam: Oh, yeah.
Matt: It's the only way to be sure. All right, so last week we mentioned this, I wanna tell you guys again: thanks to Qualcomm, Lionsgate, and their new VR experience, and the new upcoming Power Rangers movie, our friends at Nerdist are doing a circumstance where you can win a paid trip to LA to attend the movie premiere of Power Rangers as well as Google Pixel phones and Daydream headsets.

If one of you guys wins, that's great, 'cause then we have just more and more of our community winning everything, which is kind of our long-term plan, so.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Check it out.
Travis: Take over the world!
Matt: Next up. Merch. Laura, do we have any updates on that?
Laura: (muffled) Aw man, I put food in my mouth!
Travis: What the fuck are you thinking? What're you thinking?
Matt: Quick, drink the Coke! Ten, nine, eight, seven--
Marisha: I have one while she swallows.
Sam: (belches)
Matt: Oh, god!
Travis: The distance on that was incredible.
Matt: My hair went (whoosh).
Liam: Hold on, Marisha. Are you okay?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm concerned.
Liam: Are you okay?
Sam: I'm fine.
Taliesin: Why are we not talking about this?
Marisha: That sounded like something that happens when you're diseased.
Travis: Yeah, I could feel your glycogen spike from over here.
Matt: Marisha, you were saying?
Marisha: This Saturday, it's the two-year anniversary of the twitch stream. (all cheer)
Taliesin: My, how time flies.
Marisha: Yes, isn't that nice? And pleasant? And not disgusting-looking? It's a 24-hour twitch stream. There's gonna be a lot going on. There's gonna be Gather Your Party, AXYB special, there's gonna be Game the Game, and we're going to--
Taliesin: Breaded Men?
Marisha: Bearded Men, not Breaded Men.
Taliesin: Oh, I saw Breaded Men, I was very excited.
Marisha: No, Bearded Men. And we are going to be playing Mansions of Madness, some of us, here. Like around one o'clock.
Matt: And the charity stream is benefiting 826LA.
Marisha: Yeah. Yes. And the whole thing is gonna be charity-related, it's all gonna go to 826LA.
Matt: Our friends there since the beginning.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So looking forward to that.
Marisha: Yeah, so donate, we're gonna be taking donations, it's gonna be great.
Matt: Exactly. And tomorrow at noon Pacific Time, me and Darren De Paul are gonna be guesting on Eric's TBD RPG, the Doctor Who RPG, from noon to 3PM tomorrow Pacific, and then--
Offscreen: High noon? (all groan)
Screen: High noon? (all groan)
Matt: And. (all laugh)
Liam: Put him in the game so you can kill him.
Matt: Okay, that's a good call. And it looks like we'll also be continuing that game on Saturday before the Mansions of Madness stream, from 11-1. So I'll be here for five hours. Again. On Saturday. But it's gonna be a lot of fun, looking forward to it, I'm excited to go guest on there and play for a little bit, so hopefully see you guys tomorrow and Saturday. Let's see. Laura, now that you're--
Laura: Oh, hey!
Matt: Hi.
Laura: How's it going, guys?
Matt: Good, how're you doing?
Laura: We have a-- don't you touch my donuts. We have all of the normal, wonderful stuff still available in the store. The stuff that's out of stock, actually, has been removed so that you don't get confused when you're looking for things. So we have our Gilmore shirt, we got our Strongjaw shirt, we got a 'How do you want to do this' shirt, with the hoodie. We got baseball caps, we got patches, we got vinyl stickers, which I am still a really big fan of. They go on windshields, Macbooks, whatever you want.
Travis: Pets.
Laura: Pets! Not recommended.
Travis: Really?
Laura: So yeah, check it out if you wanna wear your Critical Role goodies.
Liam: You're like an Italian grandmother in Hoboken, New Jersey right now.
Laura: Ey!
Travis: Bada-bing!
Laura: Bada-bing, bada-boom, there you go.
Matt: Moving on. The new Signal Boost came out, with Jason Charles Miller as the host, our friend who played Garthok for his temporary run during the initial Conclave attack.
Travis: He is part of the Clasp.
Matt: Yes. And he is--
Marisha: And he did our theme music.
Matt: He did our theme music for the show, here, he's a very talented musician. And a good friend of the show. And you can see his new run on Signal Boost this week. New GM Tips is out today. My second-to-last on the run at this time. This episode is more for the players, and deals with creating and running characters that are against the normal tropes and the type that people generally fall into when creating a new character in an RPG. So go check it out, see if any of it seems to resonate.
Taliesin: This is how he criticizes us now, is he makes a little web video and sends it to all of us instead of talking to us.
Marisha: Yeah, it's very passive aggressive.
Matt: Took you a while to figure it out, Taliesin. But I'm glad you finally did.
Taliesin: I'm feeling it.
Matt: Also, Wednesday Club, Taliesin?
Taliesin: Yes, it turns out I have to record voice over on occasion, so Wednesday Club is not going to be me this week and I'll be talking to comic books to the engineer who will be mildly irritated with me. But instead, you guys, Matt Key is going to be hosting and he is going to talk about his favorite thing in the world.
Matt: Doctor Strange.
Marisha: Doctor Strange.
Taliesin: -- his wife, and Doctor Strange, but that's cool, too. Because him and his wife.
Marisha: Oh yeah, oh yeah, and his wife. And Doctor Strange.
Taliesin: And Doctor Strange, his work wife.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: It's great and fun.
Matt: Also, don't forget we have Talks Machina live on Tuesday nights. (all cheer)
Matt: 7PM here on Twitch and Alpha, hosted by our fantastic Brian Foster. So check us out next week to discuss this episode when it comes up. Last two things: one, we mentioned it on Talks Machina, but one of our fantastic crew members, Amandine, who's currently trying to legally find a way to stay in this country, currently put up a Fundly, the fun folks here, part of the cast and community put together a Fundly, fundly.com/we-love-amandine/ to raise money to help with her legal costs and try keep her here and working with us. The community has already been incredible. If you have any interest in help and support that, I recommend go check it out and give what little that you can because it all helps. And last but not least we got a gift today in the mail from a fantastic critter named Chris Capola who as part of an anniversary present for me and Marisha built a treasure chest. Like from scratch, like cut down the tree, trimmed, lathed... built a treasure chest.
Laura: It's amazing.
Travis: That's man-made wood right there.
Laura: We thought it was for all of us but then we realized it was just for Matt and Marisha.
Liam: It's physically beautiful but just the process we saw outlined is--
Laura: Phenomenal.
Liam: Beautiful, beautiful gift.
Matt: So Chris, thank you, tremendously, from all of us, but mostly me and Marisha. (all laugh)
Liam: I'm going to take a dump in that box, at your house, the first opportunity I get. (all laugh)
Laura: No!
Matt: That is absolutely brilliant, and undeserved and very happy to find a very wonderful place in our home to fill it with awesome nerdy shit. Thank you guys. All right, I think that's the end of our announcements. That being the case.
All: No, no, no, no!
Matt: Let's jump in--
Travis: Let's do it.
Matt: -- to tonight's episode--
All: No, no, no, no!
Matt: -- of Critical Role. (all cheer) [opening credits]
Matt: And welcome back. So, picking up where we left off this last episode, Vox Machina had made their way west into the Ozmit Sea, to the islands of Anamn and to the city of Vesrah, the final stop in Keyleth's long-running Aramente. To prove herself leader of her people of Zephra. Here they were given a task, as part of the Aramente, where they had to retrieve three lodestones within the rift of the water elemental plane, which as of late had been taken up residence by a kraken, an ancient pet of the Titans, now freed and left to wander, to feed, grow, and apparently loom across that boundary. The party went in and, due to an unfortunate vomiting episode underwater, drew the attention of the kraken.
Laura: Did you plan that?
Sam: What?
Laura: That you were almost vomiting today, and you vomited and ruined our lives?
Sam: I just plan to vomit every week. At least once.
Matt: It's for the best, I think. However, drew the attention of the kraken, and a very, very intense battle ensued, in which most of you managed to escape by the skin of your teeth, however, in the battle, Vax did fall, his body left cold and lifeless beneath the waters. In a last-minute urge of leadership, Keyleth reached out, grabbed the twins, and Planeshifted back into the prime material plane, with Percival, Taryon, and Grog looking to escape. You managed to be vomited up with, apparently, almost no hit points left, and jumped through the portal while flicking off the kraken as--
Travis: Double-birds.
Liam: Badass.
Matt: And that was where we left off. So. Before we get into this--
Sam: Wait, what? There's a before?
Matt: Vax.
Marisha: Oh, no.
Laura: You!
Sam: Bastard.
Matt: As you feel the cold waters rush around you, and your vision go dark, even as the unconsciousness takes you, your vision narrows and tunnels until it's just nothing. And while you were floating before, the cold temperature begins to become warm. It's a familiar warmth. And as opposed to being in water, there is no resistance, you are just in a dark space. You can look down, and you can now see your hands. And you recall, and you remember this. You've been here before. This is very reminiscent of your first journey into the blood pool, your first true communion with the Raven Queen. And the moment you make that realization, as you're looking at your hands, you watch as something dull and white arises from the darkness below you, and you look down and see the massive porcelain mask of the Raven Queen emerge from the shadows, tendrils of darkness spilling off the edges and the corners. As you watch the stone face of the Raven Queen rise up to meet yours, what seemed immense suddenly seems small. And as the shadow pulls away, you can see the tumbles of jet-black hair falling past the shoulders, the long, raven-feather-woven-- [no audio]
Matt: -- gathers and then vanishes into the impossible darkness behind her. The hands reach out and take you by the sides of the head, and you hear the voice once again emanating, sourceless, ringing from all around you. It says, "My champion. It seems you've stepped to return to me. But what is your destined thread to be?" Grog, as you come jumping through the portal and turn to flick off the kraken, you watch as one of its tendrils begins to-- one of its final tentacles that's still there pulls through and begins to try and grab one of the sides of the rock lodestone pillars.
Travis: Oh no!
Matt: The other guardians, half merfolk, half various individuals, rush forward and begin stabbing at it, as it begins to get its beak snapping right at the interior of this portal. You see it starting to flex and the energy beginning to pulse, it's almost trying and force its way through a much smaller opening. Percival, Grog, Taryon, what are you guys doing?
Sam: Oh, shit. We have to do stuff?
Travis: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: I'm still underwater, aren't I?
Matt: You all are still underwater, yes.
Travis: Does this happen a lot?
Matt: The guardians right now are just shouting and screaming and stabbing at the tentacle.
Travis: (yells) A lot of that? There's a lot of just open-mouthed (yells)?
Matt: Yeah, the guard's like, "Argh! Quick! Push it back!" They're all stabbing it. The one tentacle finally snaps and withdraws inside.
Travis: We could just go, we could just leave, it's just fine. It's good.
Matt: The mouth pulls back, and now the whole body shifts over, and you see the one giant eye from one side of the kraken come peering through--
Travis: Yeah, fuck that noise.
Taliesin: I am dragging Taryon-- and you, if I can drag you as well-- we're walking away.
Travis: The eyeball's soft, let me throw one more time at the eyeball. Yeah, I throw the hammer at the eyeball.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an attack.
Travis: Okay. Reckless!
Matt: Reckless. Okay, so you had disadvantage underwater, so it's just one roll.
Travis: Ah, balls. 23.
Matt: That'll hit.
Travis: Nice!
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I meant two-handed. Oh no, I'm throwing it.
Matt: You're throwing it. (music flares up)
Laura: There it is.
Matt: This connector's a little wonky.
Travis: 21 points of damage. I'm still enlarged, right?
Matt: You are, yes.
Travis: 25 points of damage.
Matt: 25. Whack! As you release the hammer, it goes Thor-style just head-first, piercing through the water, and (impact sound) into the open eye of the kraken as it slams shut. You hear the (groan) as it reels back and the voice pierces through the rift towards you and most of the people in the vicinity one more time, saying, "I'm coming soon enough." And as it pulls back, the remainder of the guardians go ahead and reach over, each putting hands on the lodestones, and shift them slightly in place, and you watch as the rift crackles and then doesn't slam entirely shut, but the image you had of the water elemental plane suddenly grows a little more opaque and difficult to make out the discerning details.
Travis: Did I manage to (thump sound)?
Matt: Yeah, your hammer does return.
Travis: Oh, thank god. Well, we all give something every once in awhile.
Matt: So, as you're carrying the-- which you were--
Sam: He resuscitated me, I believe?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: I have six points.
Matt: Yes. So, conscious, horribly beaten. It seems that the kraken has been beaten back, and currently the lode-stones are utilized to keep the rift in check. You're uncertain as to whether or not the threat of the kraken was an idle threat or whatever else it has planned, but regardless, that's the least of your worries.
Taliesin: Did we all hear it?
Sam: Hear what?
Taliesin: The kraken.
Travis: 'Cause he mind-speaks, right?
Matt: It would've been--
Travis: It brain-talks.
Matt: It would've been primarily to you, Grog, and some of the other guardians nearby.
Taliesin: Okay. That's good.
Travis: Well, he was not happy in the end, there. But he recognized true power and he was sorry to see us go.
Matt: As soon as you've had this conversation, you turn and look to the left and you see Durent there who is waiting and goes, "Where is the rest of them? Where's the rest? Where's Keyleth?"
Taliesin: They-- they--
Travis: They distappeared.
Taliesin: They went away.
Laura: (laughs) Distappeared.
Matt: "Well, let's hope that they know where they're going, at the very least. Any idea where they went?"
Taliesin: Can we breathe some air? Please?
Matt: "Aye, aye, all right, follow me, follow me." And he starts leading the swimming cavalcade of individuals that are leading you up to the top of Vesrah. Back up through the Aerie of Torrent, through the various tubes and tunnels of the reef that leads towards the surface of the Ozmit Sea. Simultaneously, Keyleth, Vex, and the lifeless body of Vax, you apparate roughly ten feet above the surface of the water on the outskirts of Vesrah. Tumble a bit, and splash into the foot-and-a-half shallow waters on the outskirts. As you all get up for a minute and think about your circumstance. Vex, you look down and you see your brother, face-down in the water, floating.
Laura: I flip him over and look at him. Vax! Vax, wake up!
Marisha: Come on. Come on. We have to get him out of this environment. Come on.
Laura: Is there a cleric on the island?
Marisha: Yes. Before I do anything, I am going to throw up a Sky Write above the city.
Laura: I start dragging his body.
Marisha: And it says, "Help. Cleric." That works. They'll get the idea. Hold on to him. Get on. I am going to turn into my giant raven form again.
Laura: How big is that?
Marisha: It's like the giant eagle form. I just kind of modify it for style.
Laura: That's tight.
Matt: Okay, so using the stats of a giant eagle but you're going into a raven-type form.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Black feathers.
Travis: Good.
Marisha: All that coolness. Yeah.
Travis: It's all about branding.
Marisha: Yeah. A hundred percent.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Okay. And what're you doing?
Marisha: Gotta be on-message.
Laura: Where are we going?
Marisha: I fly off towards the center of the city, towards where the entrance of the portal was, 'cause I'm assuming there would be sages and clerics waiting there.
Matt: Well, the portal is beneath the city.
Marisha: I know but there is like a--
Matt: There is the central chamber in the middle of the city, which is where it seemed the base of where the social gatherings seemed to occur. And the centerpiece was where Uvenda and many of the other keepers of the city seemed to frequent.
Marisha: I'll head there.
Matt: Okay. So you watch as the giant raven takes off.
Laura: Oh no, I'm holding onto her, right?
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matt: Okay, so you're holding onto her.
Marisha: She's holding onto him and we're riding there.
Matt: Okay, I see. I got you. Okay so you climb onto the back of the giant raven, clutching your brother in one arm, and as the wings pick up, you use all the might that you have to just hold on. You're used to flying under your own power usually, not somebody else's. But as the wings take off, the sea breeze, thankfully, is not too heavy that day. And as you coast in, coming down, dodging between the various buildings heading towards the central risen chamber. You watch as the upper, third-tier level of this, there's a single chamber that is open and the outside wall is a series of pillars that makes up the structure. On the inside, you can see it dips down into three different sunken platforms, and in the center there are a handful of small statues, there's incense being burned, and what looks to be a small altar of some kind. There are four figures there inside, all dressed in similar blues and greens, aquas and whites, most of them are just long robes with dangling shell-based jewelry, and various smoothed-off stones that have been found tossed and rounded by the elements through the years. And in the center of the chamber, in the process of lighting a few of these, you're not quite sure of the material, but they appear to be candles, as you see they're being lit like candles. You see Uvenda is walking with her staff, taking this long burning tube, and is currently setting them alight as you approach. As the wings of the raven begin to prepare for landing, the wind kicks up in front and you see some of the other guardians put their arm up and look up curiously. Some of them reaching back and preparing for whatever may be there. Uvenda's voice however rings out across the center of this chamber and says, "Stop! Stop. I know this one who approaches." And as they all slowly back up, Uvenda stumbles upward, sets aside her small hand-based wick to one of the servants and approaches the raven as you begin to slink off the side of the bird.
Laura: Please! Are there any clerics here?
Matt: "We do have some here of a healing-based nature. Yes. Has he been hurt?"
Laura: He's-- He's dead.
Matt: She slowly approaches and reaches over and puts her hand on the forehead of Vax's corpse. Runs her thumb along the cold skin. "Indeed. The kraken claims another."
Laura: No. No, he won't claim him. What can we do?
Matt: "The power that is at our disposal could perhaps bring him back, though his form may be different than you recall."
Marisha: I drop my form.
Matt: All right. The feathers scatter off as Keyleth is now returned to her half-elf image.
Marisha: Do you have means of traveling quickly? We have a friend who is a cleric. Can you get us to her there and back quickly? Or someone who can Tree Stride me there and bring her back? I'm exhausted or else I would do it myself. Please? Please?
Matt: "I have not a means of travel, but we could reach out to someone."
Marisha: Yeah, yeah. Any--
Matt: "All right." And she walks back to the altar, and you can see where there are a series of these statues. There's four of them in the center and there's one large statue in the center. And the center statue, it looks almost like long-petrified reef. It's white, it's porous, it looks like the long-dead reef. But it seems to swirl into a tree-like shape. It's this weird merging of sea and forest-based imagery, and as each various portion of the tree outstretches, you see various baubles are hanging from it. You see stones, necklaces, notes. Uvenda sets her staff to the side and her small, slightly arched form begins to slowly crawl up the side of the tree, and it looks a bit physically arduous for her but nobody offers to help. You see that this is something that she's done often and is part of her job as the guardian here in Vesrah.
Marisha: While she does this, I come over the earpiece and I say, Grog, Percy, quick, get back up to the central tower. Quick.
Laura: How do we even know they're alive?
Marisha: I am trusting that they are.
Matt: With the distance of the earpiece, you can hear them. Yes.
Taliesin: We're on our way.
Marisha: Oh thank god. Thank god. Is everyone still alive down there?
Taliesin: Barely. Yes, for the moment.
Marisha: Vax is down. So hurry.
Taliesin: We're on our way.
Matt: As you're finishing the statement, you watch as Uvenda is climbing down with one hand and has something cradled in her left arm as she's like (grunts), almost slips for a minute and sets herself down back on both her feet and rubs her lower back. "You'll get there one day."
Laura: Please hurry.
Matt: And she unfurls her arm, and you can see there's a conch shell. A small conch shell, but a conch shell. And she goes, "Whoever you're wishing to speak to, think of them and whisper it into the shell."
Marisha: Pike. Pike, if you can hear me, we need you, now, in Vesrah. Please, it's Vax.
Laura: How do we know if it worked?
Marisha: Yeah? I second that statement.
Matt: "She'll hear you. It's up to her whether or not she can act." And she hands the conch over to one of the assistants, takes her staff back up. "Now, we offer the service still, should you not hear anything. We are more than willing to try and restore him to whatever form we can."
Laura: How much time does-- How long is too long?
Marisha: I don't want to wait too long. Let's just wait a little while longer and see if we hear anything from Pike. She's very smart. She'll hear us.
Laura: I start brushing his hair off of his face.
Marisha: While she does that, I start gathering the feathers and start laying them out as a bed around Vax, and preparing the station.
Matt: Okay, so the scattered remnants of your transformation, the raven feathers that were shunted from your form, you begin to form into a bed-like place to set his body on. Okay. While you guys are doing that, Durent finally breaks the surface of the water, where you were originally brought down into the Aerie of Torrent. And after you've all hit the surface and breathed out, the bright midday sun is coming down, the smell of sea air hits you. You hear the distant cawing of various ocean shore birds. It's a welcome change of pace from the murky depths of the water elemental plane you've been facing for the past few moments. As soon as you emerge, Durent steps up onto the sand, turns around, shakes and brushes his hair off. "All right. Well, that's the end of my watch. I don't know what to do."
Travis: Could you point us in the direction of where your healers would be?
Matt: "Healers?" And he points over to the large ascending central structure in Vesrah. The one above where you guys had dinner the night before. "That's your best bet there. That's where Uvenda is, at least. She can help you more than I do. I spend most of my time on the outskirts, or down below."
Travis: Right. Thank you for watching our backs in there, that was real hairy, but we have to be leaving you now.
Matt: "Oh, understood."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "Hope everything's okay." And he gives you a nod and steps over to the side and watches as you guys go, as he retrieves one of his Waverunner sailing boards, and watches with a look of intensity and worry on his brow, as his dark dwarven complexion vanishes in the distance. You guys approaching, rushing in towards the center of the city. As you begin to approach, you watch as Doty, who's been waiting patiently off to the side, comes up to you and is holding the book out, and starts thumbing through page after page after page.
Sam: Ah, yes, Doty, thank you. I'll review this all later. How many pages did you fill?
Matt: He goes past about 25 different pages, in very very tiny script, that goes into detail about the tides going in, each person that went in and out of the water, anything he saw in the further distance, various birds from the sky. He does have a few spatterings of white bird excrement across the top of his armor.
Sam: Sure he does.
Matt: He seems as proud as an automaton could.
Sam: Very well done, Doty, thank you. We'll have much more to write tonight, so save some energy for that. Will you-- Will you carry me?
Matt: He sweeps you up in a full-on princess carry, and begins running after Percival and Grog, towards the center of Vesrah. You guys reach the base of this. There are all the open stone pavilions, the central gathering areas, where you now see people starting to look up curiously, coming out of their various homes and places, noticing all this commotion happening on the top of the temple. You watch as there is a spattering of dark feathers up the top. And you guys begin to ascend one of the two spiral staircases that ascends to the upper level of the temple. Eventually you guys come to the surface, you're immediately greeted by one of the guards who is on guard currently with one of their spears. And upon recognizing you, he kind of steps aside and lets you in, and that's where you guys watch as Keyleth and Vex are laying Vax down onto a kind of makeshift bed of black feathers.
Sam: What? Am I there?
Matt: You're there. You're still in Doty's arms.
Sam: Doty, down. What happened? What's going on? Is he dead?
Travis: Yeah. This is what happens when you adventure.
Taliesin: Keyleth, what--
Sam: Oh god.
Marisha: She'll come. She'll come.
Travis: Who?
Taliesin: Are there other options?
Marisha: I'm waiting for Pike. She'll come.
Taliesin: Are there other options?
Marisha: Pike will come.
Laura: There are other options.
Marisha: But they're not good enough. Pike will come.
Laura: I don't care what he looks like. I just want him back.
Marisha: Pike will come. I don't want to do this without Pike. She'll come.
Matt: Uvenda at this point is starting to gather some of the servants and they're starting to take down certain baubles and trinkets from the tree branches and setting them in a vicinity around, and as she does so she's like, "These represent protection of the waves." They take some small salts and kind of scatter them around. They're doing the best they can from a ceremonial standpoint to at least prepare a space. About 15 tense moments pass, as you all look out to the horizon, the sun now moving past its zenith and pushing into the afternoon portion of the day. The air is growing a little more hot. You find both the nerves, the stress, and the temperature of the room, all the light from the sun being reflected off the white stone, causing this kind of heated element of the interior and you instinctually begin to sweat and it's getting slightly uncomfortable. There is what sounds like a distant rumble of thunder.
Marisha: Where is it coming from?
Matt: You're not sure. It just sort of seemed directionless.
Taliesin: Is anybody else startled by it?
Matt: You guys all notice each other reacting to the sound and suddenly it happens again, but this time much closer.
Marisha: Is this normal? What's happening?
Matt: Uvenda's looking a bit awkwardly in the-- "Normal? No. But let us be cautious." As she takes her staff, her little elderly gnomish form kind of clutching it in front of her in a defensive standpoint.
Travis: Oh, great.
Laura: Don't let anything harm him.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going to run to my room and get my things. Have we had-- we have not had anything vaguely resembling a short rest at this point.
Matt: No. It all happened very rapidly. The rest has been the 15 minutes of kind of waiting to hear if anything happened. As soon as you start darting to leave, Percival, that rolling thunder sound hits with a small thunder crack. Right in the room there's a flash of light, there's a spiral burst of what looks like a white-orange flame. And there you see, dropped from about ten feet in the air, the golden astral form of Pike with her extended Sarenrae wings that slowly retract and vanish from the form. As your gnomish friend kind of looks up, her mostly corporeal form. Eyes wide, glancing up at the rest of you. Ashley, if you want to come in. (all cheer)
Sam: As Pike, Ashley Johnson.
Ashley: Hello everybody. I wish it were better circumstances. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Matt: So Pike, the message came to you and you immediately went into a frenzy. You were in the process of carrying a bunch of food along with other volunteers within Emon, getting it to some of the folks that lost their homes. And when the voice of Keyleth hit your ears, you immediately dropped what you were holding. You found somebody to help to continue to lead this effort, and immediately rushed off to find the nearest temple of Sarenrae in Emon. Which still stands, slightly damaged, but it's still one of the buildings of the temple district that's fine. There, you sat in quiet prayer for a number of minutes just imploring to Sarenrae to offer you some sort of guidance or way. And you felt something around you shift, like a push, someone just kind of pushed you in the shoulders. And as your eyes opened, you weren't in the temple anymore. You were above a floor in a brighter, sunlit, unfamiliar place. And as you land and caught yourself, you can see-- You are in your astral form, much like in the Whitestone experience. And you turn around and see, surrounding you in the center of this open-air chamber in the center of this expansive ocean, your friends, their eyes locking to you with a look of sudden joy and despair mingled.
Marisha: Oh, thank Sarenrae. You heard. And I just run up and-- I was going to give her a hug, and then pat her astral form. I hug her.
Travis: Pike, we need your help.
Ashley: Okay. What's happening?
Laura: (tearfully) It's Vax.
Marisha: Can you still do some sort of resurrection?
Ashley: Yeah.
Marisha: From here?
Ashley: I think I can. I think I can, I will try.
Marisha: How is this going to work with him and the Raven Queen? What do you know? Vex, do you know anything?
Laura: I know nothing.
Marisha: Do you know anything, Pike?
Ashley: I don't know. I've never done anything quite like this before. I mean, most of the time you guys have been there for resurrections, I don't know. I don't know. We just have to try.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Is there anything on his armor? Like, something we should be looking for? Like, a tab or a button or-- No?
Laura: I look. For any sort of message from the Raven Queen on his armor.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Ashley: That's good.
Laura: 20. What's five plus seven?
Liam: 32.
Laura: No! 22.
Liam: Oh, I thought you said 25.
Matt: 22.
Laura: 22.
Matt: I mean, most of the runic symbols and designs on here aren't formulated in a sentence structure or language. You do see the roots of them. Some of them are Draconic in root, but they've been changed as part of the enchantment of the armor. However, you do find a small, crumpled note on the inside of the armor.
Laura: Can I pull it out?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: What is it?
Matt: It's up to you.
Laura: I'm going to open it.
Matt: Okay. Do you want to tell her what's on it?
Liam: Oh, you want me to tell her? It just says your name on it.
Laura: My-- Fuck.
Liam: And it says, "Take these wings and fly."
Laura: Oh no. No. I just put it back in the armor.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: There's nothing.
Travis: Let's go get him.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Can we start? He's been here for a while. I'm sorry to bring you into this so quickly, Pike.
Ashley: No, no, no. It's okay. I would rather be here, and I'm glad that you guys called me.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Because you're in your astral form, you don't have the reagents with you. However, reagents can be provided by the party. You rummage through, and you require a diamond of at least 500 gold piece worth, which you have at your disposal, so mark that off in the bag of holding.
Laura: I'll mark it off.
Matt: Uvenda has already done a very good job of preparing the space for a ritual not quite like the one you're used to, but a similar variation, hers being druid-based magic. But you work with them over the next hour or so to take elements they've already prepared and alter it to fit the ritual style that you're used to, formulating and casting. As you finish preparation and your focus, clutching onto your holy symbol around your chest, you feel the warmth of Sarenrae that brought you here begin to swell around you. And you guys watch as the ritual continues, Pike's form begins to just emit more and more light. The interior of this temple, which is largely shaded by the roof of the temple, other than the sunlight coming in from the open walls of it, the whole interior just begins to grow brighter from Pike's presence. As the incantation begins to slowly drift from your lips and the magic begins to flare, the circle that was drawn around the body, the three parts of it-- The tricorner section of this glyph awaits. Who wants to bring the first offering to the ritual? The first attempt to bring.
Laura: I'll do it. I kneel down next to him, and I take the feathers from behind my ear, and I start braiding them into his hair, and I say, you were always better at this than I was, but you gave me these feathers in one of my darkest hours to remind me of the beauty in the world, so I'm giving them to you now, because you take the beauty with you. I've done this so many times. We've brought so many of us back, but this feels different, right? I feel as if I'm not speaking to Vax, I feel as though I'm speaking directly to Her.
Marisha: Speak to him.
Laura: No. No, he's at her side, but it's being filtered through the Raven Queen. So these are my words to her. I'm here today because of a bargain my brother made with you, so I know you like to make deals as much as I do. He traded his life. He became your champion, and you spared mine, and what a striking champion he is. Long dark hair and a strong lithe figure soaring over the land in raven feathers and a dark vestige. He set pyres in your honor. Sent soul after soul to you. It would be a shame to give that up, especially now. And I remember the book that I read. Especially now as Orcus builds his forces against you. The demon prince of the undead seeks to claim your throne. You know this as well as I. We just recently killed one of his loyal servants in the Underdark, before my brother ever came into your service. Imagine what he could do now. So this is the deal I make with you: you send him back, allow my brother to come home, and we will seek out Orcus. I will track him down, I will hunt him in whatever pit he resides, and we will destroy your enemy once and for all. What say you?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: 25.
Matt: Okay. The minute the words, what say you, leave your lips, one third of the glyph (charging noise) vibrates to life. Where the golden light of Sarenrae's power that the glyph initially emanates, the light, as it brightens, becomes a purplish-blue hue. So. Who wishes to be the next offering?
Marisha: I'll go. I go up to him, and I prop up his back and set him up against my chest and whisper into his ear and say, I know you can hear me. I know you're still in there, and I'm sure she can hear me too, but your sister is right. You've held up to your promise, to her, and you've made a promise to me. We have to settle down and live happily together, remember? You promised me. Vesrah. So I want to give you a little bit of light to follow in the darkness. And I find the scar on his back of my handprint. And I find it and I cast Daylight into his back, into the hand print and say, and besides... You know I'm in love with you, right? (quietly) That's it.
Matt: Roll a d20 and add your wisdom.
Marisha: God damn it (sniffles) Which dice? Okay. 20 total.
Matt: 20 total.
Marisha: Yeah. (whispering) Come on, come on, come on.
Matt: As the Daylight spell brightens, your instinct is to close your eyes, but you push against it, and you know this will temporarily burn to your retinas but you still, holding that still--
Marisha: I don't care.
Matt: --whispering into him. You can feel, not just the tears of your emotion but the instinctual pain of the blinding light piercing the inside of your eyes, but you hold strong as you whisper to him and as the final word leaves your lips, the second portion of the glyph grows alight and then transitions to that same purple-blue color. At which point, the Daylight spell diminishes in a way that you weren't expecting. As opposed to being this bright, glowing, blasting beacon, it shrinks down to a small condensed gentle glow, and you're afraid to move your hand.
Marisha: And I don't.
Matt: Okay. There's the last offering.
Sam: Do you think I should?
Travis: Shut the fuck up.
Sam: Oh, no?
Travis: Yeah. (all laugh)
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: You in?
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: I'll go, then. I go over to Vax. Is he on a raised platform?
Matt: No, actually, he's on the ground in a bed of black feathers and currently is propped up against Keyleth's chest. She's sitting behind him so he's leaning back against her, she has her hand against his back.
Travis: I'll stand over him. I told you before. No one kills you but me. And I think back to being in Percy's workshop at Greyskull Keep and I say, I love you too. And I reach back and I slap the ever-loving fucking shit out of his dead face. (all laugh)
Matt: Make an intimidation check. (all laugh)
Matt: Adding your strength.
Liam: Oh, jesus.
Travis: 22.
Matt: 22, okay. (echoing cracks) Keyleth, it knocks him out of your grasp, the impact is so hard.
Marisha: I just keep my hand-- come on, you have to be that hard?
Matt: The body just kinda (boof) onto the side--
Laura: Oh!
Matt: --you're like, oh god. You pick him back up.
Travis: Love hurts, Keyleth.
Marisha: I was-- oh shit.
Sam: I just let out a (yelps). (all laugh)
Matt: The third and final portion of the circular glyph alights, and then transitions to that purplish-blue glow, the entire circle complete. Oh, I want another dice.
Laura: Oh god, oh god.
Marisha: Oh jesus.
Marisha: Why is he taking a picture again?
Laura: He always does that.
Sam: He always takes a picture, he always takes a picture. It's a thing.
Marisha: Oh, fucking hell. Oh jesus, come on.
Matt: The glyphs go dark and so does the light of the outside. The entire central chamber goes dark, the light being crushed and squeezed from the vicinity. You watch as the air gets cold and a slight breeze picks up and in the darkness around you, surrounding the lifeless body of Vax, all you see is your family and darkness and there is a glowing little thread, a bead, in the sternum of Vax's lifeless corpse and you watch as a hand suddenly appears from out of the darkness and reaches down and grasps the thread, and emerging from the darkness, you all see for the first time the white, porcelain masked face of the Raven Queen. As she tugs on the small bead, you watch as a bright, white thread begins to be drawn from the center of his chest and as it does he lifts up like a puppet, just limply dangling from it. He's lifted out of your grasp and Keyleth, you instinctually try and reach for him but this spectacle is-- you find yourself unable to move, whether it be by some other power or just the sheer awe of some sort of a presence here. As he's dangled up on this thread, she stops and holds him there. The mask looks past all of you and without the mouth moving a voice fills your minds. "My champion has learned much and has done great deeds in the service of fate." "But there is still much to be done before my charge is complete in him." She releases the thread and he drifts down onto his feet, arms and head still limp. It slowly withdraws into his chest. "We shall meet again. Come find me when the time is right and I call to you to meet me beyond the divine gate." And as the mask withdraws into shadow and her form vanishes into darkness, suddenly the light comes back in. You all kinda close your eyes and blink it and the visions gone and you see all the servants around, still standing in the places they were just looking intently at Vax, their eyes still wide open and you watch as the limp, standing form there before you, the wings of black feathers slowly stretch out from his shoulders (crackling) and as they reach out and stretch and open, his head pulls back and (heavy breath) takes a breath of living air into his lungs and his eyes blink open.
Travis: How do you feel?
Liam: Where are we? I just loop my sister's head and then I loop Keyleth and I just pull them in. (gasps) Where are we?
Laura: Vesrah. You're alive. (laughs) Hey, that queen, she's pretty scary looking, huh?
Marisha: Yeah, you're not kidding, that's pretty intense.
Ashley: Hi Vax.
Liam: Welcome to my last four months.
Laura: (laughs) Hey, Pike.
Ashley: Hi, it's Pickle.
Laura: Pike's here. (shaky laughter)
Liam: Pike.
Marisha: She did it again.
Laura: She fixed you.
Ashley: No, I didn't.
Liam: Can I feel you?
Matt: There is some physicality to her divine form. Pike feels like she's there, like she can be held and touched, but it's like touching a warm, soft Jello.
Ashley: I go and I give him a big 'ol hug. A Jello-y hug. Gloop!
Matt: Or like a big piece of cotton. It's softer and gives a bit.
Marisha: Cotton candy Pike.
Matt: Kinda, yeah. Kinda.
Liam: I take hold of the Jello head and press my head into it and say, thank you, sister.
Ashley: Of course, Vax.
Liam: Thank you.
Ashley: I give him a cotton candy kiss on his forehead.
Travis: Aw, man.
Matt: As she does so, and she releases your head, Vax, you look at her face and you look up and just behind her, you see the mask there, and the voice comes to your head. None of you see this, just Vax. And says, "Soon. I'll call for your purpose. In time." And it just fades and you can now see the sea beyond the midday of Vesrah now surrounding you.
Liam: Whoa. Hey, I feel like shit.
Laura: Hey welcome to the club.
Travis: Yeah, you punched your card.
Laura: Yeah, all that's left now is Keyleth.
Matt: Which, by the way, your jaw is sore and you're pretty sure you're missing a tooth.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: Can't grow that back, bitch.
Matt: Okay, yeah.
Liam: (spits) I walk over to Grog, and I try to reach my arms around him and fail. You fucking fucker, come here.
Travis: Yeah, welcome back. Don't be weird.
Liam: Ah, you've met me, right?
Travis: That's true.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Glad you're not dead. Really glad you're not dead.
Liam: Me too.
Laura: Do you need to rest? Do you need to go lay down?
Liam: Don't we all?
Marisha: I feel like we all need to rest.
Laura: Well yes, but--
Travis: I'm good.
Marisha: I turn to Uvenda.
Matt: Okay. She's still kind of like, "Well. I'm glad to see that this was a success. That your friend could come in aid as well."
Marisha: Grog. Tary.
Sam: Yes?
Marisha: The lodestones.
Laura: Oh. I pull mine out as well.
Sam: Oh. Oh, yes. I hereby present to you a lodestone that I got at the bottom of the sea.
Marisha: Yeah. Good job, good job. Good work.
Matt: She kind of points over and the servants come up and collect the three of them and she goes, "Well, this is fine news. I was worried that we had a loss, and perhaps this endeavor was incomplete. However, it appears that you've both survived the encounter with the current scourge to Vesrah's rift, and you've completed your Aramente, young Keyleth. There will be a celebration tonight before we send you back to Zephra, where you will be formally crowned by your father, Korren."
Marisha: Oh, that's happening tonight? Oh wow, this stuff moves fast, yeah
Matt: "We'll celebrate this evening. You'll return at your leisure, but--" And she kind of walks up to you, and she can see the tears, and she kind of reaches up with her wrinkled, sun-wrecked, elderly gnome skin. And reaches up and rubs the tears from your face and goes, "It's all right. You've done well. And I'm sorry."
Marisha: For what?
Matt: "For a lot of things. The Aramente didn't used to be this dangerous. It's tradition, but our trial has changed, and while we grew confident in your confidence upon arrival, we should've been more attentive. This might not have happened."
Marisha: No. It was my negligence in proper planning that added to this.
Matt: "That may be the lesson learned at this trial. But I think we have learned a lesson as well. And perhaps we need to adjust our trial, given the dangers of our recent elemental guardian."
Marisha: I think the landscape of the world has changed a lot recently, and I think the Aramente should reflect that. So I would be honored to provide any insight to help.
Matt: "Well, come back. Come back once you've returned to your people and become the Voice of the Tempest. Then we may alter however you see fit. Anyway, glad you're awake!" Taps you on the head with the staff.
Travis: Unconscious. (all laugh)
Matt: "Shit!"
Laura: How many people lose their lives on their Aramente? How many people complete it?
Matt: "Well, the Aramente is generally not a lethal experience. The kraken only arrived this recent generation, and honestly, the only two who's had to take it with the kraken's presence were Keyleth and her mother."
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: I'd been hoping to run a perception check through pretty much this entire conversation, to make sure she's being completely honest about everything.
Matt: Insight check, you mean?
Taliesin: Yeah, an insight check. Meh, 13.
Matt: 13. Hard to read.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: She seems to be upfront.
Marisha: What do you mean? Why were we the only ones with the tools?
Matt: "Well, before the kraken came to the rift, it was simply an excursion to gather the lodestones amongst errant elementals and other mild dangers within the plane. The kraken had only been drawn to the rift--"
Marisha: Recently.
Matt: "-- recently. And unfortunately, Vilya was the first to take the trial with it residing just beyond our door."
Laura: How many people did she have with her?
Matt: "She went in with five."
Marisha: And none returned?
Matt: "None. Two of which were our own."
Marisha: I'm sorry.
Matt: "That's the danger we face in these times. To exist among such ravaging elemental forces is a danger unto itself. But that is the call of the Ashari by nature, is it not?"
Marisha: Yes, it is.
Matt: "To safeguard the rest of civilization from these terrors. Anyway, enough dourness. It got rather cold here and I think we could use some warming heat of the sun, some food and perhaps some rest for you." Hits you again on the forehead.
Liam: I'm alive.
Marisha: Do you mind if we take a brief respite amongst ourselves, before we catch up with you and join in the festivities?
Matt: "But of course! It's--" And she looks at the sun. "It's about time for my sailing, so I'll see you here in the next hour or two." And she goes, and two of her servants start flanking her down the stairway.
Marisha: Kaitiaki, Uvenda.
Matt: She stops and turns, looking back at all of you, and gives a deep bow. "Kaitiaki." Continues to make her way down the stairs.
Ashley: Keyleth.
Marisha: Group hug, guys, group hug!
Travis: You did it.
Marisha: Come here, Tary, you too.
Sam: Oh, me too? All right, okay. Sure, sure. This is natural, this is right.
Liam: Who is that?
Laura: What are you talking about, 'who is that'?
Liam: That guy, who is that guy?
Laura: What are you talking about, that is Taryon.
Sam: Oh, come now. You recognize me. Taryon Darrington! The brave, the bold. We both fell in battle, so I know exactly how you feel right now.
Liam: Oh, I've read your book!
Sam: Well.
Liam: I know you.
Laura: I didn't think it was published yet.
Sam: Not quite yet, but I'm sure people are already talking about it.
Liam: How did you do, Tary?
Sam: Well--
Travis: Yeah, how did you do, Tary?
Taliesin: Well, he did well.
Sam: Doty, take this down.
Matt: Which, as you look over, Doty has been faced away from the entire ritual and had been recording the various weather elements and surroundings.
Sam: Doty, no! We just witnessed an amazing ritual. Did you not get any of that?
Matt: Turns the book around and you can see it talks about cloud structures, it talks about a few children that were playing in the water below.
Sam: Well, you are consistent. I'll fill you in on the details of that later, but now take this down. 'Plagued by an incompetent plan and ambushed by a surprise from a kraken, we nevertheless stayed 'true to ourselves and to our bravery, found the lodestones and, despite nearly dying, came back to 'tell the tale, proving ourselves as heroes of Vesrah and to each other. I was aided by young 'Percival in my fight. Abandoned by the Antlers and the Elves. And by the end of the fight, it was 'just me and the big guy, duking it out. I blacked out for a moment, but before I did, I'm sure he 'saw my bravery and was impressed. That's why he dragged me to safety and presented me to Percival 'for healing.' That's enough for now.
Laura: You forgot to mention the part where you vomited and blew our cover.
Marisha: Oh, that's right, you did do that.
Laura: Thank you.
Sam: It's not-- This is the abridged-- I don't want to bore the readers with too much detail.
Travis: It's so weird. I totally remember walking past you and trying to leave.
Sam: Somehow, I got to the rift door and I didn't get there on my own, so thank you. Thank you, Big Guy, for dragging me there. I appreciate it.
Laura: Um, Pike.
Sam: Oh!
Ashley: Have I met-- I don't know-- My memory is not-- Who are you?
Sam: Taryon Darrington. We passed briefly in Whitestone.
Matt: Briefly, yes.
Ashley: Yes, I didn't realize you were still with my family.
Sam: I'll switch to Gnome.
Ashley: Oh, it's fine, I can--
Sam: And I'll say, oh, you're friendly with these people as well?
Ashley: Ah, yes.
Sam: They've taken me in and they're showing me the ropes of adventure, and we've already done quite a lot. We were on a boat that was attacked.
Ashley: Oh wow.
Sam: And we almost died, but I destroyed the beast that was attacking us with a bit of magic.
Ashley: How did you destroy it? Do tell me.
Sam: I have a lot of tricks. Magical things that I think you might even understand, because it seems that you are a magic user yourself.
Ashley: I dabble.
Sam: The resurrection thing that you just did was amazing. I've never seen anything like it, and it was quite astounding for somehow who's not really here. Hello?
Matt: Your hand (impact sounds) does actually hit the side of her face.
Sam: Oh! Sorry, sorry.
Laura: And they're speaking this whole time in Gnome?
Matt: Yeah. This whole time, you've been hearing (talks Gnome).
Sam: By the way, how is my accent? I haven't had a chance to practice Gnome on an actual gnome in a long, long time, since I was a boy.
Ashley: It's terrible.
Sam: Oh.
Ashley: But it's nice to be able to speak it.
Sam: I apologize profusely for butchering your language. I learned it by books, and, as I've said, I've only had a chance to speak it once before to a gnome who visited my family's estate a long time ago.
Ashley: Oh? All gnomes know each other, so who was it?
Sam: I didn't catch the fellow's name.
Ashley: It was a fellow, that narrows it down.
Sam: He was part of a performing troupe that my father hired to entertain us on New Year's Eve. And they came in, stayed a few days. I remember quite vividly though that they left in a hurry. Something went on with one of the members of the troupe and my father's handmaiden, and he was very upset with it and he chased them all off in the morning. I didn't get to continue practicing with him. All I know is, my father was so upset. Something happened in his room, he had to burn his bedsheets, and I think he got a new bed. I don't know quite what happened, but it was quite a dramatic thing. I was only about 12 or 13 at the time.
Ashley: That sounds like somebody that I would love tremendously.
Sam: Well, he had a sharp wit to him, and-- not very attractive young man, but--
Ashley: He sounds very familiar. Like I said, us gnomes do know each other.
Sam: That's amazing.
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: Really? And is it true that you live hundreds of years, and--
Ashley: Thousands, even.
Sam: Is-- Oh! I--
Ashley: Thousands.
Sam: I was misinformed.
Ashley: It's something you should know. Yes, I should-- if you need to know anything, you should always ask me.
Sam: I will. I--
Ashley: I will tell you all the truths.
Sam: I will-- I was planning on doing at least one chapter in my book about the smaller races, and that would be an excellent--
Marisha: Oh boy.
Sam: -- an excellent fitting, uh, addendum.
Ashley: (laughs) Well.
Taliesin: Yeah. Yeah.
Ashley: You are just delightful. (all laugh)
Sam: Well you-- you are, too. Pleasure to meet-- make your acquaintance.
Ashley: (laughs) Okay.
Travis: You can feel free to smoke this fool, it's fine.
Ashley: No, that's fine. He's a little bit of a twat, isn't he?
Travis: A little bit.
Ashley: I don't mind him, though. All right.
Matt: All right. So. As you guys take a little bit of time to go ahead and rest, recover, converse, and bask in--
Marisha: Heal up a bit?
Matt: Heal up a bit, take a short rest, use your hit dice, get your abilities back that do come back from a short rest, we're gonna go ahead and take a quick break. Be back here in a few minutes. Hold onto that back-up character!
Sam: Oh!
Matt: 'Til later.
Laura: Oh, until later, okay, okay.
Marisha: In case.
Liam: I'm 98% relieved and 2% bummed that I--
Matt: I know!
Taliesin: No, I know the feeling, man.
Matt: I know. Who knows, it may still come up.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: What does that mean?! We don't know what that means! You can't say that shit!
Matt: What?
Liam: Raven Queen. Just kidding! (weird caw noise)
Travis: Raven King! Wooloolooloo!
Matt: It's almost like future challenges in the story might involve more death, I don't know.
Laura: Uh-huh.
Ashley: I'm eating my feelings. (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah, a little disappointed, but this works well.
Laura: So we'll heal up now.
Matt: Yeah, heal up now, we're gonna take a break, we'll be here in a few minutes, guys. Much love. We have another giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood tonight! I don't know what we're giving away, 'cause I was to give--
Crew: Dice tower. Dice tower!
Matt: A dice tower! Oh, snap. You guys are getting a full-scale dice tower. What is it? It is wood. It is made of wood and it is a dice tower.
Crew: We're running it up to you!
Matt: And it's gonna be free to the winner! So, come on over to the Twitch chat, and get involved over the break. The word is raven, R-A-V-E-N.
Travis: 69 hit points.
Matt: Go ahead and-- Yeah you are, Grog. Oh. Oh snap! That is not a dice tower--
Crew: Not a dice tower.
Matt: -- it's a deck box.
Crew: Sentinel box.
Matt: Sentinel box! Which is still rad. They told me it was a-- but however-- oh, that's cool! It has like a small magnetic-- must be for minis and-- or dice, if you want to. So that's pretty rad, actually. So anyway, this 'Bird's Eye Maple Sentinel Deck Box' is gonna go to whoever the winner is.
Travis: Oh, that's pretty.
Matt: Type 'Raven' into the chat room of Twitch to win. We'll have an announcement when we come back. See you guys in a few minutes. (all cheer) [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role. (background laughter)
Matt: Damn it. First and foremost, I wanna mention that our fantastic fundly to Amandine is apparently already really close to its goal! (cheers)
Matt: So if you guys want to check it out, it's fundly.com/we-love-amandine A-M-A-N-D-I-N-E. If you can give anything, we're almost at the goal, which is awesome.
Travis: That's amazing.
Matt: Also, we have the winner in chat!
Sam: (loud burp)
Matt: Thank you, Sam.
Taliesin: Whoa.
Sam: Sorry. Still reeling.
Taliesin: How you feeling, buddy?
Sam: Still reeling.
Matt: We have the winner in chat of our fantastic deck box from our friends at Wyrmwood, it is @stevetharia! @stevetharia, you are the winner, we're gonna go ahead and sign that box and get it sent to you, that Sentinel box. Congratulations. We'll have more giveaways in future episodes, so if you didn't get it tonight, come back again, and have another chance, which is awesome! All right. So. Bringing us back in. You guys have had some time to recover, gather your thoughts, gather your wits, and reflect on the recent near-permanent loss of your Champion of the Raven Queen, Vax'ildan. You now currently sit wherever you'd like within the city of Vesrah in preparation for an evening celebration. Is there anything you guys wish to do in the meantime?
Liam: How much time has passed since I got brought back up there?
Matt: About an hour.
Liam: About an hour?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: A little over an hour?
Matt: A little over an hour, I'd say.
Liam: A little over an hour?
Matt: Just from resting, yeah.
Liam: Just out of curiosity, do my wings 'shloop' back in?
Matt: Yes, they have retracted.
Liam: They did.
Taliesin: Where is everybody?
Marisha: Yeah, are we all together?
Matt: You guys are all together, if you wanna be, yeah.
Laura: Can we be on the beach?
Marisha: Ooh, yeah.
Matt: Sure!
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Is there a beach?
Matt: Well, there are portions where the sand kind of breaks the surface-- a lot of it is, you know, maybe a foot, foot and a half, below the water before you start hitting the reef and the, you know, the beach shelf drop off, but there are places where the sand rises above, and there are patches where you see a lot of the kids kind of play around and leap off of, and there are beach elements closer to the islands on the outskirts of the city, between the actual islands themselves. So yeah, there are beaches.
Taliesin: I'm going to be crafting little seashell necklaces or hair bits for everybody-- I've been working on a hair bit.
Laura: I like it.
Taliesin: Mm. Little--
Laura: Like a hair bit, or like a hair bit that goes like this?
Ashley: Ooh.
Taliesin: Yeah, and like the--
Marisha: Oh, yeah yeah, yeah!
Taliesin: -- with the little, yeah.
Laura: Ooh! Yeah!
Marisha: With a-- mm.
Taliesin: You know what it-- yeah--
Laura: I like it.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: It's like we've had this conversation.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: Making little bits for everybody.
Matt: There you go. As you're working on that, Vax, you do notice in this time that you see one of your sister's feathers that's kind of carefully braided into your hair.
Laura: All of. I've only got two of 'em and they're both in his hair.
Matt: There you go. Both of your sister's feathers are braided into your hair.
Marisha: I have something for you all. I have presents.
Travis: Presents?
Marisha: Mm-hm.
Laura: What for?
Marisha: Well, I had Gilmore help me out with a little something for if and when I completed the Aramente, as a thank you, so I got them from him before we left-- granted, in hindsight, I'm never holding onto presents ever again, 'cause we could all just die any day. But!
Liam: Like we do.
Marisha: At least--
Laura: Like you do.
Marisha: Yeah, like you do. But this time it worked out okay. And I pull out all the necklaces. These are from the dragons we've collected. They're dragon-tooth necklaces.
All: Ooh!
Marisha: And I had Gilmore enchant a very simple enchantment to each of them, so it won't-- you won't have to focus or attune to it--
Laura: Oh!
Marisha: -- if any one of us goes unconscience-- unconscious.
Liam: We're with you.
Marisha: If any one of us goes unconscious--
Liam: Don't sweat the details.
Marisha: Thank you. The rest of them will start beating a little heartbeat. That way, we know if any one of us goes down, even if we can't see each other. So. Grog!
Travis: Yeah!
Marisha: Pike!
Ashley: Thanks!
Marisha: And Vex!
Laura: It's wonderful, it's a little morbid and wonderful at the same time.
Ashley: I love it.
Marisha: Yeah. I know--
Liam: Nah, it's fucking badass.
Laura: That's so wonderful, Keyleth.
Travis: It's nails.
Marisha: Figure we all go unconscious so often--
Laura: That's so thoughtful.
Travis: Well, most of us do.
Ashley: Is that for--
Marisha: Mm. Totally had this one made for Scanlan.
Travis: Mm. Just hold onto it.
Taliesin: I say--
Sam: I understand, and that's fine. I--
Marisha: Think I should hold onto it?
Travis: Yeah, just hold onto it.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Don't give it to him.
Liam: I mean, this is a--
Marisha: But here's a flower! And I Druidcraft him a flower.
Sam: Oh!
Laura: What a bummer! Oh, I feel like somebody that just got party invitations, it's like oh, I ran out!
Taliesin: I make sure Tary gets a little seashell crown. So.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Thank you. This flower--
Marisha: I mean, you can-- do you wanna wear it for now?
Taliesin: We do have to get him an earpiece.
Matt: As you're staring at the flower and contemplating the awkwardness, you feel Percival slowly come up behind you and just put a little seashell crown on your head.
Taliesin: Long may he reign. (all laugh)
Travis: Oh. My. God. Oh my god.
Taliesin: Is there anyone else around, by the way?
Travis: Science bro vomit.
Taliesin: I wanna check, are we being listened to? Is there anyone within earshot? Is there anything--
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: You know, maybe I should go ahead and just give this to Tary, I can always have Gilmore make another one.
Taliesin: 16?
Laura: You could always get it back from him if he decides to leave our presence.
Matt: I mean, there are folks wandering around, and there are some people that are kind of just younger folk--
Laura: It could be safe, if he's---
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: -- or people that are general denizens of Vesrah that are just excited that all of a sudden these people came in and apparently battled a kraken and word has gotten around already--
Laura: Just let him know it's to hold it.
Marisha: Here, Tary.
Sam: What?
Marisha: Just... you did good.
Sam: You're giving this to me?
Marisha: You did good here today.
Sam: You're giving this to me.
Marisha: At least for now. I can probably have another made--
Sam: I drop to my knees. My lady,
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: Oh, jeez. Oh.
Sam: I cannot express to you what this means, to be accepted as a full-fledged member of this team, and-- (sounds of protest)
Sam: I knew this day would come, I didn't think so soon, but--
Taliesin: It has not come.
Sam: -- I suppose, finding that lodestone and helping you on your 'acapakay'--
Taliesin: Ooh.
Liam: I lay down on the sand and just close my eyes.
Sam: -- was enough to win over your good graces. I've watched you in these last few battles, and you have been powerful--
Marisha: Okay-- thank you-- thank you.
Sam: I wasn't done.
Travis: (laughs)
Sam: Powerful, confident, and enthralling, and I vow to use this to the betterment of our entire team, to make sure that none of us fall in battle, not me, not Percy, not you, not either of the elves, not short stuff or the big guy.
Ashley: Ooh (laughs). Oh, you're so great.
Marisha: Thank you.
Laura: He doesn't know our names.
Sam: Thank you, so much.
Ashley: He doesn't know your names.
Marisha: Thank you, thank you. That's--
Travis: Look what you did.
Sam: I will cherish it always.
Marisha: Yeah, all right, thank-- you're welcome. Thank you.
Liam: Keyleth, you have just passed the final challenge of your Aramente.
Marisha: I think you're right.
Taliesin: I wonder--
Marisha: I can't take it back from him now. Or ever.
Matt: As you put it on, Doty's hand goes--
Sam: Oh.
Liam: Grog will take it back.
Sam: Oh, he's sketching me?
Matt: Doty begins sketching you. (all laugh)
Sam: No-- wait 'til I find the light, find the light, find the light--
Laura: Trinket goes up and pees on Doty's leg.
Matt: (lumbering bear noises)
Liam: I'm imagining a really simple etch-a-sketch drawing.
Matt: (sniffs, then pee sounds)
Sam: I don't want to move, I'll break the pose.
Matt: It's warm.
Laura: Oh, Trinket, that's not a tree. That's a robot.
Matt: (bear sounds)
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, dear.
Laura: It'll come off. Don't worry.
Matt: Doty does not seem the least perturbed by it.
Taliesin: Uh.. Keyleth, I've been thinking. What do you think the Aramente is supposed to teach?
Marisha: I've been thinking about that a lot myself.
Taliesin: I'm regretting that I hadn't been thinking about it until today.
Marisha: Well, they don't really tell you much. Just tell you to go back-- go out into the world and prove yourself a leader, with no real definition on what they think a leader should be.
Taliesin: Well, they tell you to go out and gather a group of friends, and then thrust yourself into a death-defying situation that is likely to get people killed.
Marisha: That is one way you could phrase it, yes.
Taliesin: I'm-- and I don't mean to worry you-- just be cautious, I don't-- I have that nagging feeling, and I'm hoping it's wrong, but I think it is possible that they feel you did not lose-- you did not learn the lesson of the Aramente.
Marisha: Well, that'll be a discussion that I have with Korren, with my father.
Taliesin: What if the lesson is loss? What if you're supposed to go down there and watch people that you love die?
Marisha: We're not barbaric! We're not-- no one wants to lose anyone on an Aramente.
Taliesin: The thing that defines the worst leader a people could have is a lack of empathy.
Marisha: Do you think I'm not empathetic?
Taliesin: I think that they make sure their leaders might-- I think it's possible, I don't-- I'm nervous. I think it's possible that they make sure their leaders are empathetic by making sure they know pain.
Marisha: Percy, do you not think that we have experienced ample amount of pain and loss over the course of this?
Taliesin: I do, I just hope that it was enough-- I just-- you know me.
Marisha: It's not a blood sacrifice, it's a tradition, it's meant to show us the world, and yes it's flawed and I want to fix that.
Taliesin: This is beautiful here, and I-- I look forward to leaving.
Marisha: Ha.
Taliesin: And I'm very proud of you, but I will be on my guard, just in case.
Marisha: I don't think my traditions really vary that much from yours, which could still be perceived as old-fashioned, if you will?
Taliesin: Every farm boy in Whitestone, once he's old enough to talk and work, names an animal, raises it, and butchers it.
Marisha: You know, it's interesting, Percy, I've always looked at you and I as that opposites-attract conundrum. As my best friend, I feel like you are always the natural born leader who has been running away from it ever since I met you, and I'm the one who's not as naturally gifted, but is racing towards it faster than--
Taliesin: I think I'm too cruel to lead. (sighs) Regardless, speaking of which, oh boy. Grog.
Travis: Yes?
Taliesin: I have something to say. In a moment of panic, I may have influenced your decision to save Taryon from the kraken. I instantly regretted it-- not because of you, Taryon, I do apologise for that-- I instantly regretted it. It was a poor decision. I fully apologize, and if you wish to keep my glasses, I totally understand, and at the very least, if I have a swift punch in the face coming, I completely understand. I'm so sorry. And I wish I could say I would never do it again, but I honestly don't trust myself that much. But I am really, really sorry, and if anything had happened I would have run in to save you as best I could.
Travis: You look so, like, constipated right now.
Taliesin: I think you're gonna punch me. (all laugh)
Travis: How did you influence my decision?
Taliesin: It's-- I don't know, sometimes I can just be unnaturally convincing.
Travis: Is that a bad thing?
Taliesin: In the wrong hands, which are my hands on occasion. I felt bad. I feel bad. I feel like I did-- I was not a good-- I feel like I made a poor decision, and put you in peril, and subverted your free will. Does that make-- Uh, no.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: Small words.
Matt: You do, Grog, recall as you guys were swimming up to Vesrah, and you were kind of following up to the path, you thought, why did I save Taryon?
Travis: Yeah, why did I save Taryon?
Taliesin: Because I'm a jerk. That's why you saved Taryon, 'cause I'm-- because I can be a bad friend.
Travis: Mm. What does that have to do with me?
Taliesin: I just am trying to be honest with you, because I respect you, and I would hate for you to think that-- I-- (sighs) Terrible at this.
Marisha: Are you all right, Percy?
Taliesin: No, I'm not all right. I've made some bad decisions today and I've terrible thoughts and-- Ugh, I'm so tired.
Travis: Tary?
Sam: Yes, sir?
Travis: Are you glad you're alive?
Sam: Extremely.
Travis: Well, there you go.
Taliesin: How about we just say I owe you one?
Travis: I owe you one?
Taliesin: I owe you one.
Travis: I thought you said I say I owe you one.
Marisha: (laughs)
Taliesin: No, well, you can say that, too, but just know that-- that I owe you one. I owe you-- what-- It's--
Travis: How would that even work?
Taliesin: That would work--
Travis: We'd just be owing each other forever.
Taliesin: I just-- Have some seashells... And a skipping rock.
Travis: Ooh! (all laugh)
Taliesin: I feel better. That's all I needed.
Travis: I leave.
Taliesin: That's all I needed, I feel better.
Laura: Don't worry, Percy, he makes it--
Matt: (laughs) As Grog walks away with a skipping rock--
Travis: (laughs)
Liam: Somewhere in the middle of all that serious talk, I've pulled my sister off to the side and--
Travis: (laughs) So good.
Liam: -- have cajoled her into playing Airship. You know, when, so-- we used to do this as kids--
Travis: (laughs)
Liam: -- I lay on my back--
Laura: (gasps)
Liam: -- and I lift her up in the air--
Laura: Yeeeah!
Liam: -- with my feet holding her up--
Laura: I love this game!
Liam: -- and I'm kind of in pain but I can kinda do it.
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: How do you even have strength for this right now?
Liam: (groans) I am ropy as fuck.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: We are almost even now--
Laura: In what?
Liam: Well, we're twins, so, you've died, I've died. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh, right! I thought you meant in size.
Liam: No, no, no.
Ashley: (laughs)
Liam: But you've died twice. So--
Laura: Yes, I have.
Liam: You are more ambitious than I am.
Laura: (laughs) We've always known that.
Liam: (laughs) Yeah. You know, we really need a break.
Laura: Yes, we do.
Liam: I think we're going to hell soon, literally-- But maybe after that, maybe we could take a break.
Laura: I don't know if that's going to happen, dear. I sort of made a promise to your queen. Could you hear it on the other side?
Liam: I don't remember anything.
Laura: When we were trying to bring you back, I kind of sort of-- And I come down off of his feet (laughs) and stand up--
Liam: (painful groaning)
Laura: I kind of, sort of promised her we would hunt down Orcus.
Matt: You do recall hearing those-- As she says this, you remember now the various things that were said, as the ritual's kinda coming to clarity. And you realize the immensity of the offer that was given.
Laura: I mean, I was trying to get you back. I know that is really hard and we probably are going to have a very hard time finding Orcus and killing him since he's like, you know, a god, I think--
Travis: Ooh, ooh!
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: Hey, you're here now! (snaps fingers) I'm sorry.
Liam: Hey, man, no judgment, it means you're just like me.
Laura: Yeah, right? Stupid decisions to bring the people you love back to your side. Very stupid.
Liam: What the fuck else are you gonna do?
Laura: Stupid to be a champion, stupid to kill Orcus, stupid all around.
Liam: Did you give a timeline?
Laura: No, no, no! I just kind of said we'd go and do it. So, it could be, you know. Ah, I just said we would do it.
Liam: No, you know, in all seriousness, I have been waiting for something. I don't know what. But I'm not running towards it.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: I think we'll get there.
Laura: Yeah. Yeah. I have a feeling she pulls our fate strings anyway. She'll make sure we get there.
Liam: (sighs)
Laura: Mine's connected to yours. Wherever you go, I go. Unless it's, you know--
Liam: I start to cry a little bit.
Laura: (laughs) Aw! I'm glad you're back.
Liam: I don't say anything.
Matt: You hear what sounds like a whip crack of thunder.
Sam: (gasps)
Matt: As you glance over your shoulder and watch as Grog with the Titanstone Knuckles skips a stone so hard-- (all laugh)
Matt: -- that it shatters into multiple pieces upon making contact with the water.
Ashley: (claps) Grog!
Laura: (claps) Grog!
Taliesin: (slow claps) I can die happy now that I saw that.
Laura: That was amazing!
Ashley: That was cool!
Marisha: That was awesome!
Travis: Is that a record?
Marisha: Yeah!
Taliesin: It may be.
Ashley: Probably.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: I write ten on a sheet of paper and hold it up. (all laugh)
Travis: Where'd you get that paper from?
Laura: I have it in my bag.
Ashley: (laughs)
Travis: That's amazing.
Laura: I know.
Liam: I think you just hit Whitestone. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I'm showing Pike the jewelry I'm bringing back. So, since I can't give it to you now, I'm just modeling it.
Ashley: Oh, it's--
Taliesin: It's a little hand thing, it's got some tie things.
Ashley: (gasps) Percy, it's beautiful! I want it now.
Taliesin: I don't know if that will go well.
Laura: It will fall off of your form.
Taliesin: Patience!
Liam: Does it sink through-- slowly through the Jello?
Taliesin: I'll clean it off. (all laugh)
Matt: As the afternoon comes to a close and the sun slowly sets on the distant ocean horizon, the lights begin to brighten anew to usher in the eveningscape of Vesrah. A similar gathering of the people of Vesrah that you celebrated with the evening before comes to life, even more vibrant and excited at the tale of an Aramente completed. As this is transpiring, you guys are brought in, food is prepared--
Marisha: I'm in my fancy clothes, by the way.
Matt: Okay, yeah, fair enough. You guys-- wherever you can, as you guys--
Laura: Ooh, seashell bras.
Liam: I'm in the Deathwalker's Ward. (all laugh)
Laura: With salt crusted on it.
Marisha: Yeah, it's still a little soggy and damp.
Matt: As you guys are getting ready and brought into this, and people are beginning to come up and congratulate you, bringing their kids up to shake the hands of the future Voice of the Tempest, you watch as a group of figures appears on the outskirts of the light in this central meeting area. You glance over and watch as all of a sudden the nervousness kicks in, and everyone turns and looks, as there, dipping into the light, you see Captain Adella and the crew going, "Okay, so we've been waiting for quite a while and it looks like you're having a party without us. So. Mind if we join in?"
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on!
Matt: "Told you!"
Taliesin: Pour.
Marisha: Toss a drink, yeah.
Matt: And the rest of the crew comes in, of the Drensala Vis.
Laura: What about the prisoner? Is he still on board?
Matt: "Oh yeah, no, we're leaving that fucker on the ship. We're not taking him here."
Laura: All right.
Matt: "So. Everything went fine, I suppose?"
Liam: Peachy-peachy.
Matt: "Great."
Marisha: Right as rain.
Matt: "Fantastic. Going back soon, then, huh?"
All: Yes.
Matt: "Great, first light of the morning, let's get back."
Travis: Are you in a rush?
Matt: "No, but the longer we're here, the more time we spend out wandering amongst the reef with these people." And she glances around, and as you look around, you do see a very comparably bohemian lifestyle of the water ashari.
Liam: Eyes Wide Shut?
Matt: Not quite that level.
Marisha: What's your definition of bohemian?
Matt: Yeah!
Liam: Eyes Wide Shut. (all laugh)
Matt: I'm so glad you don't live in Los Villas.
Sam: Like Venice people? Like beachy hippies.
Matt: Yeah, it's very Venice Beach.
Taliesin: Like Labyrinth muppets, maybe. Like the creepy head Labyrinth muppets.
Liam: Everybody looks like the Raven Queen. (all laugh)
Matt: But yeah. Drinks are had, the party celebrates, and then eventually Uvenda begins to approach, and everyone gets quiet, and she walks up towards you, Keyleth, and reaches out to take your hand, both of your hands in hers. "In completing the trial of the water ashari, I impart unto you now a gift. Something I, as far as I understand, have only been around long enough to learn. But seeing the strength that you hold, perhaps you can wield this as well."
Marisha: Okay?
Matt: As she takes your hands, she folds them over each other, and she encloses them in her tiny gnomish grasp. "Close your eyes." As you close your eyes, and you can hear the hush of people silencing each other around. "Now, the form of one who protects the elements is malleable. You can transcend this particular form and become the beasts of nature. You can become the creatures of the elements that we safeguard. However, those who've mastered the journey that you have? They can become so much more. Now walk with me." And she tugs on your hand. "Keep your eyes closed, but walk with me." And you guys watch as she backs up and leads Keyleth out of the pavilion, out into the darkness in the center of the main thoroughfare of Vesrah. The crowd wanders along, if you guys want to shuffle with. She leads Keyleth out, eyes still closed, and as soon as people start crowding in, she goes, (huff of breath), and the guards hold people back and leave a wide berth around. "Now. Keyleth. You've encountered many beasts, many dangerous and powerful creatures from all walks of the planes. Pick one."
Sam: (gasps)
Matt: "What do you see in your mind?"
Marisha: I think of the goristro, Yenk.
Matt: "Imagine what it's like to be filled with strength, to be filled with the power. Envision the horns, the snarl, the barrel-like fists." And you guys watch as Keyleth's form suddenly begins to shift and grow and where once was a half-elf Keyleth, you now see, towering above this tiny gnome, eyes still closed, a massive goristro.
Travis: No fucking way.
Taliesin: Oh, well, that's disconcerting.
Matt: Everyone goes (gasps) and as her hands leave yours, you feel something shift and change and you hear the slightly more distant voice of Uvenda say, "Now open your eyes." And you look down--
Marisha: (screams)
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: That's less disconcerting.
Laura: Is she stuck like that?
Matt: "No, no, she's fine. This is under her control."
Laura: Okay.
Liam: She's fine.
Matt: "This incantation is yours now. Be what you wish. Use these creatures."
Marisha: I turn into a beholder.
Matt: (swoosh) You watch as all her body--
Travis: Shut the fuck up.
Matt: -- shifts and becomes--
Travis: Shut up.
Matt: -- a meaty mass with a singular eye and many eyestalks and you watch as everyone takes two steps back (gasps)--
Travis: You can not do that now!
Laura: What is this?! What is this?! What the fuck?!
Travis: Are you serious?!
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: What is this?!
Marisha: I am a golden god! (all laugh)
Matt: "Your shape is yours to change, Keyleth."
Marisha: I change into-- adult bronze dragon.
Matt: You watch as the beholder that's looking around excitedly suddenly shifts and grows two large bronze wings--
Ashley: (laughs)
Matt: -- claws emerge and the head extends.
Taliesin: Oh dear.
Liam: That is really hot.
Laura: But like, that's really big. How?
Marisha: I do a victory lap (whoosh).
Matt: (whoosh whoosh)
Laura: How is this possible?
Travis: Can she do the stuff they do?
Laura: Is she like a dragon for real? Does anybody--?
Matt: Uvenda turns to you as you're shouting this, everyone's kinda watching her fly over, you can see the little bit of light that glows from the city occasionally reflect off the metallic underbody of the dragon as it circles overhead in the dark night sky. Uvenda turns to you and goes, "Ah yes. Don't worry. These forms are hers to control."
Marisha: I turn and-- brass dragons have fire breath, right? Do they have fire breath?
Matt: I'm pretty sure.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Very frightening.
Marisha: I do-- into the air, I just go (kwoosh)
Matt: I'm gonna look this up real fast so the internet doesn't hate me.
Marisha: See what happens.
Travis: You kill everyone on the ground. (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah, it is fire breath. So you watch as she flies off, she shoots forth this burning hot, bright jet of singular focused fire, not a napalm-level red dragon cone breath, but a singular focused beam of burning fire that just lights up all of Vesrah around. You see the hundreds of the denizens around go, "Oh!" as their faces glow against the dark sky around you.
Laura: I feel far less nervous about this Orcus thing now.
Ashley: Yeah.
Liam: What was that?
Laura: Ha. (laughs)
Travis: Wow.
Ashley: Wow.
Laura: That's insane.
Matt: Uvenda's just looking up and smiling, clasping her hands together.
Travis: Who needs a fucking magic carpet now?
Marisha: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
Travis: We got a jumbo jet.
Marisha: I come back down and I come down and I'm like (animal noises).
Laura: Can't you talk as a dragon? Can't dragons talk?
Marisha: Oh, that's right.
Travis: (laughs)
Marisha: I'm so used to Beast Shape! (all laugh)
Marisha: I'm so used to not being able to fucking talk!
Liam: She's gesturing and I'm already climbing on.
Travis: (animal noises) Oh she can change into a dragon but she's-- yeah.
Ashley: If I touch her, does she feel like a dragon?
Matt: Yeah. You feel the hard scales across her hide.
Marisha: So I can talk?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Hey guys! Guys, check it out! Ah, Ah.
Laura: I like the idea that it's just like your regular-ass voice coming out of--
Marisha: Yeah. I'm like, ah guys! Got little antlers.
Taliesin: This went so FernGully so quickly.
Matt: Yeah. It's Keyleth's voice but it's deeper, it's resonating, it quakes the sand on the ground near her when she speaks.
Travis: (deep voice) Hey guys.
Laura: What the fuck. What is this?
Travis: (deep voice) It's me, Keyleth.
Laura: Like, this is amazing, Keyleth.
Marisha: This is-- I don't know.
Sam: (whispering) She's amazing.
Laura: We should have completed your Aramente a lot sooner.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: You wanna go for a ride?
Travis: (deep voice) I'm so happy right now.
Laura: Yes!
Ashley: Yeah!
Marisha: Okay, all right. I pick up the half-elves.
Laura: And Pike!
Travis: Hey, hey!
Laura: Pike wanted to go too.
Marisha: And Pike!
Ashley: I did want to go. I want to go.
Liam: Don't let the jello fall apart.
Taliesin: There's always room for jello.
Ashley: It's fine if I fall apart. It happens.
Matt: Okay, as the tinier folks step onto the back of Keyleth-dragon, they take off into the sky. You watch as a bunch of the children now begin to try and line up now.
All: Aw.
Matt: And the parents are like, mm-hm.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: I am clearly moving ahead of them to the front of the fucking line. (all laugh)
Matt: As Grog forces himself to the front of the line--
Ashley: I was here first.
Matt: -- like palms a child and just pushes it back, like Old School, just (pff) out of the way.
Travis: Yep.
Marisha: And I totally spend the next hour giving joy-rides to anyone who wants to.
Matt: And yeah, most of the folks of Vesrah begin to start giving in to it--
Marisha: Dragon rides.
Laura: Wow.
Matt: -- taking dragon rides from Keyleth over the night sky (laughs).
Travis: Wow.
Ashley: Wow.
Travis: Holy shit.
Marisha: I leveled up.
Laura: That's pretty fucking sick.
Matt: Yeah, and in fact, I'll go look at the logistics of this, but after that kraken battle, most everybody leveled up on that.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: I'll send that out tonight via email to you guys.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Laura: Sweet!
Marisha: So that's Shapechange, right?
Matt: You have Shapechange as one of a possible 9th-level spell.
Sam: What is Shapechange?
Liam: That!
Sam: You can just become anything?
Laura: It's a ninth-level spell.
Marisha: I can change into anything that's a challenge rating of my level or lower.
Sam: Once?
Laura: Wait.
Sam: Or constantly?
Marisha: For an hour.
Laura: Dragons are your level?
Marisha: Adult dragons are.
Matt: An adult one. Not an ancient.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: Wow, still, adult dragon is like, right on par.
Matt: It's not bad.
Liam: Guys, we've been playing this campaign for a while. (all laugh)
Travis: This is amazing.
Marisha: (sighs) I wasn't sure if I was ever gonna get here.
Travis: Fucking amazing.
Marisha: (heavy sigh) Yeah I can. It's for an hour and I can keep shapechanging into different things for an hour.
Travis: You can whip those beholder eyes at people?
Marisha: Yes, I can.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: Holy shit.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: And you can do all the things that they can do?
Travis: Is it at will or is it a random roll for which eye does what?
Marisha: It's like Beast Shape, so I keep my intellect, my wisdom, and my charisma, but I take on their physical stats--
Laura: Ah!
Marisha: -- and their abilities.
Ashley: You're a beast.
Travis: And same thing, like you drop the shape's hit points and then it reverts back to you.
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: You don't get legendary actions--
Travis: (laughs)
Marisha: I know!
Matt: -- or lair actions but you get all the rest of the abilities and physical attributes of the creature.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: I'd say that's pretty fucking sick.
Travis: Oh my god.
Liam: Forget about strawberry, how about raw-berry! (all laugh)
Laura: Ah man.
Taliesin: Juice Springsteen.
Ashley: Holy cow.
Matt: So eventually, as you feel the spell begin to dissipate, the shapechange coming to an end, you bring the last cluster of children and Grog, who has ridden now seven times. (all laugh)
Liam: (deep voice) Whee!
Travis: Ah!
Matt: As the night draws to a close--
Marisha: As the spell fades, I just give Grog a big hug and just kinda cry tears of joy into his chest for a little bit.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: And yeah, reverting back to your form, the party comes to an end. Uvenda comes up to you as you come back to your form and says, "I'm proud of you."
Marisha: Thank you. Truly.
Matt: "Now, return to your people victorious. You achieved what your mother could not and her memory lives on in you."
Marisha: Thank you.
Matt: And she turns--
Marisha: I will keep her-- Thanks. That's all.
Matt: "Good night." And she begins to walk off with her staff. You guys are able to rest for the evening, prepare yourselves for the following day's journey, however you wish that to be. So you get benefits of a long rest back. So you get half of your hit dice back, you are healed to full, you get your spells, you're good.
Travis: That was such a great party. (all laugh)
Marisha: That was a good party.
Ashley: Did you have so much fun, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, I rode the dragon all night. (all laugh)
Travis: It was great.
Marisha: That's true. I see Percy really quick. Are you still concerned?
Taliesin: Yeah, well, yes.
Marisha: (laughs)
Taliesin: Congratulations.
Marisha: Wouldn't be you--
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: I--if you weren't concerned.
Taliesin: No, and thank you for not being-- somebody has to be all right. I mean, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Marisha: Wouldn't be here without you, or the others. You know that, right?
Taliesin: I do.
Marisha: I can't do this alone and I-- To answer your question from yesterday, I think the problem of this Aramente is that it shows you the components of what you need to be a leader, but being a leader could take a lifetime to master. If you even can master such a thing. So lots still to go, this isn't the end.
Taliesin: I know.
Marisha: And I hope you stay with me.
Taliesin: I will, to the end.
Marisha: I need you.
Taliesin: I need you, too. But we're not all going to make it.
Marisha: Well, let's at least go home for now. Is that okay? Is that enough for now?
Taliesin: It certainly is. I am happy to try. But things are only going to get more complicated. Congratulations. That's very impressive.
Marisha: I feel like once you can turn into a dragon, things only get more complicated.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Marisha: That's, yeah.
Taliesin: I will thankfully never know.
Marisha: All right, let's go.
Liam: After she left our room to go find him, I start to suit up, and I'm looking in a full-length mirror at the new fucking kraken beak gouges down the front of me. And I notice that my two notes are out of place. So I'm going to shove them back into the folds that they're supposed to be in. And spend a couple minutes to button all the way up and leave the room.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Can I find Tary?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Oh, good morning.
Travis: No, it's like real late, right?
Sam: I don't know. Is it?
Matt: You haven't quite gone to bed yet.
Sam: Oh!
Matt: It's late evening.
Sam: Good evening!
Travis: Jesus, that fight knocked you goofy, didn't it?
Sam: I have not been that close to death ever before. But I feel like in a way I learned something from the experience.
Travis: What? (all laugh)
Sam: That's fair. (all laugh)
Sam: Tell me, I saw you up there fighting.
Travis: Mm-hm.
Sam: You were brave and strong.
Travis: Yep. Yep.
Sam: We were duking it out, you and me, 'til the very end of that fight and well, as one seasoned warrior to another--
Travis: Mm-hm.
Sam: Do you have any tips? Any notes for me? Any thoughts to improve my warfare skills? Should I move more? Should I think of cool one-liners to yell out as I hit my enemies?
Travis: Ooh, yeah. That always helps. Right? Someone like you, I would probably stay on the outside. You got a little in the crunch zone, right? You seem to have a good range on your weapons.
Sam: Well, yes, but my rod is best at close-up action.
Travis: Most rods are good close-up but, you know, if you could stay on the outside with it, maybe you'll have better success? But, I wanted to give you something.
Sam: Oh!
Travis: Yeah. It's like a last resort, right? Cause you went like eee! And it was not good.
Sam: No.
Travis: So I want to give you a magic egg. And I reach into the bag of holding and I take out a basilisk egg that I have no fucking idea how old it is. But, it's in there. There are six of them.
Matt: It's old.
Travis: This egg is very, very special.
Sam: Oh my god.
Matt: It's about this big and the outside of it has this very layered stone look to it. Almost like when plates shift and you watch old sediment stone stick out. And you can see the different types of stone layers, geologically. It's that kind of a texture down the side of it and it's like a dark gray, almost blue color.
Travis: This egg comes from a very ancient magical beast. If you find yourself in a dire need. Like in that last fight.
Sam: Yes. Yes.
Travis: If you break it and consume its contents, you will be granted immense power.
Sam: Really?
Travis: Indeed. But only in times of great need. I trust I don't have to emphasize how important that is.
Matt: Grog, make a deception check.
Travis: Shit! Come on big whammy.
Taliesin: I'm so proud of you, Travis. However this goes, I'm so proud of you.
Travis: Yes! 15.
Matt: Make an insight check, Taryon.
Liam: You're not Scanlan.
Sam: Eight. (all laugh)
Travis: I out-rolled somebody!
Liam: With your mind!
Taliesin: You used your mind.
Matt: This is a mighty gift.
Sam: Adding it to my list. Basilisk-- wait, I don't know what it is. It's just an egg. A magical egg.
Matt: A magical egg of power. To be consumed.
Marisha: It's like a Kinder Egg. There's a toy inside.
Matt: Kind of. Yeah.
Liam: Except it's full of sulfurous shit.
Travis: That shit is rank.
Laura: I imagine that I've been introducing Pike to the whole crew. Since you like to sail so much.
Ashley: Yeah. Hey, crew.
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: You're welcome.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Is Doty, Dottie, his robot around?
Laura: Doodie.
Matt: The robot stays with him when he is told otherwise not to. So, it's hanging with him. When you're introduced to the crew, they're all your ilk. They're all salty, sarcastic folk. Captain Adella and you could-- they're all taken aback by your strangely-not-really-physically-there form. But, after a bit of trading some tales about a few interesting at-sea endeavors, you guys get along swimmingly and it's a fast friendship between you and Captain Adella.
Ashley: Fantastic.
Laura: She's fucking cool.
Ashley: She seems rad.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So, what're you doing?
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to go over to Tary.
Matt: Okay. Taryon, after you're granted this majestic egg, as you're walking back to your homestead, the glowing gnome approaches you.
Sam: Oh! Hello.
Ashley: Hello again. I have a request of your robot. Your Doty. Am I saying this right?
Sam: My personal manservant.
Ashley: Your personal manservant.
Sam: Yes.
Ashley: Could he draw some things for me?
Sam: In Gnome, I say, absolutely m'lady. Whatever you would request.
Matt: You are a m'lady.
Marisha: We totally called it.
Matt: Continue.
Ashley: And in Common, I say back, thank you so much. Doty, would you mind drawing portraits for me?
Matt: Looks back to you, Taryon.
Sam: Do whatever the young lady asks.
Matt: Pulls the book out.
Ashley: Could you draw some portraits of this group? Of Grog. Of Vax and Vex. Keyleth and Percy.
Sam: Just a little bit of a note, here. He doesn't know who any of those people are.
Ashley: Okay. So the people that I point to. Could you just draw each of them please?
Matt: Everyone's kind of scattered to the four winds right now.
Ashley: Shit.
Laura: I'm there.
Sam: I'll help you point them out to Doty.
Matt: Yeah, Vex is there.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Yeah, you point out to where they're all staying and--
Marisha: We're gathering up anyway. We're walking over.
Ashley: When you're all done, just bring them to me. Thank you so much.
Sam: Is there any particular style you'd like them to be drawn in?
Ashley: Just as realistic as possible.
Sam: Realism. All right.
Ashley: Realism.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: And I say, thank you, in Gnomish. In Gnome.
Sam: I say, you're warcome in Gnome. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I've been waiting for it.
Ashley: Okay. That's all.
Matt: All right. So as you all go to rest for the evening, Pike, the granted presence here through Sarenrae's will begins to withdraw. Her strength through the divine gate to keep you in this, seemingly drained. You sense that you'll be returning back to Emon until you're retrieved by your allies here.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: So, you'll only have a short time. As the rest of you guys go to rest for the evening and you all go to sleep, Percy, Keyleth, Vax, Vex, and Grog, I need you guys to roll perception checks.
Travis: I got this.
Sam: I'm just doing this all night.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Travis: Are we going Gil? Yeah. Don't fuck me, Gil.
Marisha: That's not bad.
Sam: You got to try Gil.
Taliesin: No! I'm going with that one.
Sam: I'm negating that. Roll Gil.
Taliesin: You don't get to negate that one.
Sam: I'm negating it. Roll Gil.
Travis: 19.
Matt: Oh!
Travis: A natural 19.
Laura: 29.
Taliesin: No I'm going with my first one. You don't get to negate my roll.
Liam: 22.
Sam: He rolled a three.
Marisha: 23.
Taliesin: I did not roll--
Matt: Wow!
Taliesin: I'm going with my first roll because he's a jerk.
Matt: All right. What was the first one?
Taliesin: 27. Jerk.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Your friends all rolled with Gil.
Matt: Throughout the evening--
Marisha: Rolling with Gil.
Matt: At some point in the night, each of you individually wakes up in the wee hours as a sound rouses you from your slumber as you glance over in one of the nearby open windowed walls. You see a large, metallic man-shape appear. And just start feverishly sketching while staring at you. (all laugh)
Matt: One, by one, by one, by one.
Laura: As our faces are like--
Sam: He likes to watch.
Liam: That was Tary's fucking automaton.
Marisha: I'm not dreaming. I'm not dreaming.
Taliesin: Okay, yeah.
Travis: Does anyone try to talk to the automaton?
Marisha: Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.
Taliesin: I think we'd just stay perfectly still?
Laura: Yeah. (all laugh)
Taliesin: And try and lift our chin and push forward.
Laura: 'Til it looks like a good angle, at least.
Liam: I slowly pull the sheet up--
Marisha: Yeah, higher, yeah.
Travis: I pull the sheet a little lower. (all laugh)
Matt: And Doty continues sketching, adjusting to the new positions.
Liam: Moves an adjacent piece of paper next to it and keeps going.
Matt: Keeps taping them on. All right.
Ashley: Is he done?
Matt: I will say--
Ashley: I'm just afraid I'm gonna (whoosh).
Matt: I will say, for the sake of narrative of this, the energy will carry you through to the morning.
Sam: Yes.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: So, upon everyone waking, and gathering again before heading however way you wish, the crew is by their boats to return to the ship, Uvenda is waiting to see you off, and, as you all begin to gather, you watch Pike as she approaches, her form flickering in the familiar visual of a temporary time before she has to return--
Laura: Oh no!
Ashley: It's okay.
Matt: As you approach to speak to everybody, suddenly (grinding robot movement) from the side, Doty seems to just slam into view, like some weird hype man.
Travis: A hype man! Yeah yeah!
Matt: And immediately just hands you a metallic fist filled with pages torn out of the tome.
Ashley: Thank you so much.
Matt: And then runs off towards Taryon.
Ashley: Tary. Come here.
Sam: Who, me?
Ashley: Yes, you.
Taliesin: Couldn't be.
Sam: Hello.
Ashley: Hello. So, I figured you would have a little bit of an easier time if you know the names of the people that you're spending time with. I had him make you some, I don't know, maybe some flash cards. So, I take out a quill. I hold up a photo. Who is this?
Matt: What you see before you, is a very beautifully realistically drawn image of a female half-elven druid, and a male half-elven rogue paladin, both clutching bed-sheets, going-- (all laugh)
Sam: That's amazing. In the same drawing?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Oh! But how did-- I mean, they would have had to have been--
Ashley: I didn't realize he was going to draw them in their sleep. So, let's just--
Liam: Please, go through every picture, please!
Sam: Oh. I-- so many more questions than answers. (all laugh)
Marisha: It hurts!
Sam: One of those two was dead yesterday, and yet they still found time to-- well. The one on the left, I lovingly refer to her as Antlers. She is the most powerful and leader of the group.
Ashley: All those things are true, but take this quill. Now, next to her picture, please write 'Keyleth'.
Sam: Doty? You heard her.
Ashley: No! No. No, no. No.
Matt: Doty stops when she says no.
Ashley: You are going to write it down.
Travis: Mama Pike!
Ashley: Do you know how to write?
Marisha: Mama Pike.
Sam: Of course I know how to write. I'm an educated man.
Ashley: Okay, I would--
Travis: Oh god, how does he know how to write?
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: In what language?
Ashley: What language do you prefer?
Sam: I prefer Gnome when I'm with you.
Ashley: Okay.
Liam: Old habits die hard.
Travis: Yeah, yeah!
Sam: It's good practice.
Travis: Little bleed-through.
Ashley: Okay. So write down 'Keyleth.'
Sam: Odd vowel sounds in your weird language. Okay! Key-leth.
Ashley: The man laying next to her--
Sam: Mm-hm?
Ashley: Do you know his name?
Sam: Little Elf Boy.
Ashley: I would never say that again. His name is Vax.
Sam: With a 'B'? Like Bax?
Ashley: With a 'V', as in--
Sam: Vagina?
Ashley: Vagina. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Manna from heaven. Manna from heaven.
Sam: Got it.
Laura: Oh god.
Sam: 'X'. All right.
Ashley: Next up.
Sam: You know what, that one sounds familiar, I feel like he's introduced himself to me.
Ashley: Okay. Next up, who's this?
Matt: This is another pair. (laughs) This one--
Travis: I'm so happy.
Matt: --less shy. It appears to be a human male, looking confused, with glasses pressed up above the top of the forehead, and a half-elven, dark-haired, female, on top--
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: -- glancing back with a 'don't you fucking dare' expression.
Marisha: Yeah. (all laugh)
Sam: Oh! Oh, well. I--
Ashley: Yes, I know, you're learning so much.
Sam: May I, for a moment?
Ashley: Sure!
Sam: Do you think this is up? Or--
Ashley: You could have it any way you like it. (all laugh)
Liam: Oh my god.
Sam: I've read about that. All right.
Ashley: Just looking at the faces, then, who do you think they are?
Sam: The happy one is Little Elf Girl--
Ashley: Ooh. I would definitely not ever say that to her.
Sam: All right. All right. What's her real name?
Ashley: Her name is Vex.
Sam: All right. Vex.
Ashley: And you know that her and Vax are twin brother and sister?
Sam: I could tell by the bone structure--
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: -- and the contempt. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Oh! Oh.
Ashley: Now. (laughs) The man laying next to her, what is his name?
Sam: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Korrolo de Rolo the third. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Well done!
Sam: Almost! Almost!
Travis: Oh man!
Sam: Almost! Almost! Klossowski de Rolo the third!
Taliesin: Close enough!
Sam: Percival--
Taliesin: Close enough!
Sam: --Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel--
Taliesin: Muselix.
Marisha: (laughs) Von Muselix.
Sam: Argh, so close!
Liam: You know what? The Klossowski, Klossowski--
Sam: Klossowski de Rolo the third!
Taliesin: It's a little--
Laura: Gets ya every time.
Liam: That was bullshit. That was bullshit.
Taliesin: That all depends on how much whiskey. That's fair.
Ashley: Please write it down.
Taliesin: That's a whiskey-based pronunciation.
Sam: That one I'm going to do in Common. (all laugh)
Sam: And you know what? I'll just abbreviate the middle part.
Taliesin: That's okay.
Sam: P... de Rolo.
Liam: What's Percy's rapper name?
Ashley: Great. Two more to go. Who's this?
Matt: Well see, all right. This one is Pike, in her gnomish form, still wearing her armor in her astral form, looking like she realized she didn't phrase it properly when she made the request. And being the last one sketched, and that moment her expression says, 'Oh no.' (all laugh)
Travis: Oh no.
Sam: Before I answer, uh, (accented) answer--
Marisha: An-swer.
Sam: -- just a quick process question, here.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: In the other images, there was some revelry, some intercourse happening. Is that-- now that I'm a full-fledged member, do I-- (all laugh)
Sam: Do I get to partake? Is this how it works with everyone? Or is it just certain members--
Travis: Holy shit.
Sam: Is it a hierarchy? Is it some sort of a--
Travis: Oh god.
Sam: -- a cultish--
Travis: Oh my god.
Sam: -- thing, where you have to prove yourself sexually and in battle, or-- how does that work?
Travis: I can't even handle this.
Sam: Or is it-- am I misreading this?
Ashley: You know, I think you should just continue to try to explore that. (all laugh)
Ashley: Because--
Travis: Wow.
Ashley: It would just be great just to see what happens. You never know, Tary, you just never know.
Sam: All right.
Ashley: I would never tell you no.
Laura: (gasps)
Ashley: No! Not me-- (all laugh)
Ashley: Let me rephrase. I would never tell you no to not trying with the people of the group.
Sam: So you're saying that membership has its privileges?
Ashley: Mayhaps.
Laura: Oh god.
Ashley: Do you know my name?
Sam: Daughter of Sarenrae, I'm guessing.
Ashley: No. It's Pike.
Sam: Hm. Pike.
Ashley: And last, but certainly not least--
Matt: Whoa.
Sam: Oh boy. (all laugh)
Liam: Narrate it, Matt.
Sam: Doty, she said realism.
Matt: (creaks)
Sam: Really? (all laugh)
Matt: And there, in a classic Michelangelo-style pose, one knee cocked to the side, the beard fluffed, the rippling scarred muscles, and the obvious half-giant side of Grog Strongjaw before you on the page.
Liam: That is not a picture of a goliath and a halfling, by the way.
Sam: I mean, how does he walk?
Taliesin: With confidence and pride.
Travis: Pick a leg.
Ashley: Yes.
Sam: Wow. Wow.
Ashley: I know.
Sam: That is just-- that is primal.
Ashley: He took some artistic liberties with this one.
Sam: Huh.
Laura: Ho ho ho!
Liam: Made it smaller.
Sam: All right. I've been taking to calling him Jumbo, or the Big Guy.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: And it seems that I was correct. (all laugh)
Ashley: Well, this--
Matt: This joke went too far.
Ashley: -- this is Grog.
Sam: Say that again?
Ashley: Grog.
Sam: Grog. Okay.
Ashley: And that is my very best friend.
Sam: You know, I have learned that he is a confident ally, and a friend to me as well. And I will do my best to protect him in battle in your absence.
Ashley: Well (laughs) thank you. That is very, very kind of you. So, before I leave, my request is that you look at these every night before bed until you learn them.
Travis: I love it so much.
Liam: Love Mama Pike.
Sam: Can you-- in this form, can you see me all the time?
Ashley: Yes.
Sam: I will.
Ashley: So I will know if you're not looking at your flashcards every night. (all laugh)
Ashley: This is so stupid.
Liam: This is Dungeons & Dragons, man!
Taliesin: This is amazing.
Liam: This is Dungeons & Dragons!
Sam: Milady, I swear it by my name, I will do so as you request. Thank you for saving one of my allies today, and wherever you are in the world, know that we are fighting the good fight, and I will keep your friends safe. Your friends, Greg--
Ashley: Nope.
Sam: -- Vox, Vox, Kiko--
Taliesin: Kiko works.
Sam: -- and Percival Frederickstein Von Musel--
Taliesin: Let it roll.
Sam: -- Klossowski De Rolo the third.
Taliesin: That's pretty good. (all cheer)
Sam: Ah.
Ashley: I realise that was off of memory, so I'm gonna let it slide, but yes.
Sam: I have a few more nights of studying to do.
Ashley: You do. Okay. It was wonderful to spend time with you. I'm gonna just-- I'm gonna go back over here.
Sam: All right.
Ashley: Goodbye.
Sam: Serf trervles. (all laugh)
Marisha: (laugh) Serf trervles.
Taliesin: (laugh) Serf trervles.
Travis: Holy shit.
Matt: I did not expect it to go that far.
Sam: (laughs)
Travis: My fucking--
Taliesin: Wow.
Travis: -- my ears hurt.
Liam: I have a fresh new set of six-pack abs after the last ten minutes.
Matt: Seriously.
Sam: We gotta get Ashley back. We gotta bring her back.
Matt: All right, so as you guys get over--
Sam: We gotta get Ashley back.
Ashley: Sorry, that went a little bit longer than I thought.
Matt: No! No!
Taliesin: It was so good!
Matt: You know--
Laura: That was awesome.
Matt: In Doty being literal, it lead to all of that joy. Holy shit. So. As you guys all gather on the beaches in the late morning of Vesrah, Adella and her crew are waiting at the boats to return to the ship. And Uvenda and a few other folks there, you see Durent, you see Yulan, the little boy that met you when you first got here, and a few of the other folks that you met that evening, all waiting, and as you approach, Uvenda nods, and, "It has been an absolute pleasure to have you, Vox Machina, at the sides of Keyleth, to come and spend time with our people, to celebrate the completion of a difficult journey. I would request before you leave, to please return the goggles and neck pieces that we lent you."
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: It's like an IMAX theater.
Matt: Kind of. They go and collect the pieces from you as you go on. "And best of luck in your future journeys. If we, the Ashari of Vesrah, can be of aid to you in the future, please let us know."
Marisha: Thank you for everything. I'm sure we'll be in contact soon.
Matt: Kaitiyaki.
Marisha: Kaitiyaki.
Matt: And they turn around and start walking their way back to the center of Vesrah. Some of the kids looking over their shoulders, kind of waiting to see what you're going to do. Adella is waiting there at the ship, "All right, so, what's the plan?"
Marisha: I mean, I totally could Tree Stride us anywhere, but I kind of want to take the boat again.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're getting all our money's worth out of the boat.
Marisha: Yeah, we paid a lot, yeah.
Travis: What are we gonna do?
Marisha: To Emon for now?
Liam: Well, Hotis is going to come for Pickle and I at some point, but we need to do a little more homework this time.
Laura: Where can we study? The Cobalt Reserve? Is it still standing at all in Emon? Are there any books left?
Marisha: We can go see.
Liam: Gotta go to the liberry.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: We also haven't looked at any of the findings from Raishan's cave.
Travis: Oh yeah.
Taliesin: No, not yet.
Travis: Lots of books to read, real exciting.
Marisha: Well, let's at least get back to Emon, that's the main port town.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: It's a starting point.
Marisha: It's a starting point.
Taliesin: We can also have them start looking at the books while we're away, telling us if they find anything of value.
Laura: That's true. Probably need to start studying Orcus as well.
Travis: What?
Liam: Orcas, orcas, after all of that under-sea--
Laura: All those killer whales.
Liam: -- struggle we need to be up to par.
Travis: Ah, know our allies?
Taliesin: There'll be time on the ship. Let's take our time, before the Orcas.
Matt: All right. At this point Pike begins to flicker.
Laura: No!
Ashley: It's okay, I'll see you guys very soon.
Liam: Jello shot, where you going?
Laura: Back home?
Ashley: Yeah, back home. Jello shot? (laughs)
Marisha: We're heading to Emon so we'll see you there, okay?
Ashley: Okay, I'll see you soon--
Travis: Wait, quick squeeze!
Ashley: Quick squeeze!
Matt: And she vanishes in your grasp.
Travis: Ah, no! Ahh!
Marisha: No, no, no, she's okay.
Sam: No, no, no.
Laura: No, no, she's okay, she's fine.
Liam: Twin on each arm pulling.
Matt: It's not enough.
Taliesin: It'll be fine, he's just going to make himself pass out, it'll be just fine.
Marisha: True.
Liam: Percy, get over here and pull!
Taliesin: I want to see, let him sleep it off.
Marisha: Just let him sleep, let him sleep it off.
Travis: (wails)
Matt: You guys make your way onto the ship with Captain Adella at the helm, the boat turns around, navigates the thin pathway between these exterior reefs, and eventually to the open seas of Ozmit.
Marisha: I-- if you're interested, Adella, because I'm feeling pretty spiffy after--
Matt: She's holding onto the wheel like, "You worry me already."
Marisha: Okay, all right, I can control the winds and give us forwards-facing winds for a solid hour if you want. You want it? You want a little, turn this into a speed boat? You know? See how fast it goes? I don't know what this means, I've just seen other sailors do it so.
Travis: In a lot of countries it means one thing, especially when sailors do it.
Matt: "Be my guest."
Marisha: Okay, I cast fifth-level Control Winds. I'm going to do just a solid gust behind us for a good hour.
Matt: Okay, and with this consistently used, you guys can cut about half of the travel time back to Emon.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: So what would normally be, depending on weather, like five, six, seven days, you get there in three.
Laura: Nice.
Matt: Through the use of that, your general Control Weather abilities and stuff-- it's pretty fantastic. Thinking in the back of your head as you travel that while you've completed your Aramente, it is not done, you still have to return to complete your Aramente. You guys eventually find your way, coming into the docks on the western side of Emon, the city still in the throes of rebuilding, restructuring, it's busy, people are returning, flocking to the streets. It's very warm and welcoming to come back to a city that is coming to life again. Where the grim reality post-Thordak's fall has now been replaced with, it seems to be a vibrant, buzzing energy of recovery and moving forward. This still is the central city of Tal'Dorei, and the people who have returned to this are bringing it back as soon as they can to the splendor it once held, being the jewel city of this continent. You guys, after docking Adella and the crew, which I can't recall, did you pay them in advance?
Laura: Mm-hm.
Matt: Great.
Laura: No, I'm sure I did, marked it down, so.
Matt: I'm pretty sure you did.
Laura: Oh no, I didn't, because we had decided on 150 gold per day. So, we went back quicker than we thought so three days back, five days there?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Laura: And then how many days were we in--
Matt: Technically, two.
Taliesin: Two.
Matt: One, two nights in Vesrah.
Laura: So ten? So just over 1,000 gold, that's good.
Sam: I'll take care of it.
Laura: Are you going to write her an IOU?
Sam: No, I'll pay her in gold.
Laura: Taryon, really?
Sam: I hired you all, it's only the right thing, Vex.
Laura: Wow. Thank you, Taryon.
Sam: I'm a man of my word.
Laura: I'm going to stand by your side as you pay her.
Matt: Captain Adella's there with her crew behind her. "It's been an absolute pleasure. Should you require our assistance again, you know where to find us, and if not, we're busy making money elsewhere, fuck off."
Sam: 1,500?
Matt: She takes the coin purse from you.
Sam: Plus 150 tip.
Matt: Takes that, hands it to one of her-- her first mate--
Sam: Plus 200 for any damages to your ship.
Matt: "It was quite damaged." Passes it off to her first mate again and you can see the first mate is kind of the sheepish mousy gentleman who is currently in process of counting all the coins as they come in, he's, like, the on-board accountant and he's just-- "We're good." "Wonderful. Thank you so much for your patronage. Wish you all a fond farewell. Now shoo."
Laura: Taryon, thank you.
Sam: It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Laura: All right.
Matt: You guys head into the city, and with each street corner there's another building with a roof that's being re-roofed. You can see walls being re-stoned and structured. You can see carts being brought in from the docks as trade has now begun anew within the city, and there is a semblance of culture, life and society continuing to still re-emerge and spread with each visit to the city, and it's very heartwarming and harkening to the good that you've done through the struggles and challenges leading up to this time.
Liam: I'm sorry, old man, who's in charge here these days?
Matt: "In charge of what?"
Liam: The city? Who's running things?
Matt: "Oh, the Council."
Liam: They're doing all right?
Matt: "I think so?"
Liam: Okay, everything steady as she goes?
Matt: "I mean, my house is in ruins and I haven't seen my grandchildren but--"
Laura: Wow.
Sam: (laughs) Jesus.
Taliesin: Well, that was English, well done.
Matt: "Could I?"
Taliesin: That was the most English thing I've ever seen in my life.
Liam: Sure thing, Grandfather.
Matt: "Good day to you." Then he just wanders off.
Laura: Can I just pull Keyleth aside as we come on land? And just say, I was very impressed with you. For a long time, I've harbored a bit of doubt, I'm sorry to say, and when you brought us away from the kraken, I was very angry and very fearful. But you've proven yourself, so much, and I want to say I'm sorry.
Marisha: There's no need for an apology. Just, you being there means everything.
Laura: I believe in you.
Marisha: That means a lot, coming from you, because I think you're just the coolest. I'm sorry if I ever put you or your brother in harm's way. Or anyone else.
Laura: We all did it willingly. He especially.
Marisha: Well. Thank you. What now?
Laura: Well, we still have some things to take care of. We have a crown to get on your head. I can't believe you're going to be royalty. Royalty-royalty.
Marisha: Royalty's a strong word.
Laura: Rule royalty. That's pretty fucking cool, Keyleth.
Marisha: Well, you're pretty cool yourself.
Laura: Ah, well.
Marisha: All Grand Mistress Nightwatch. What's it called? Whatever.
Taliesin: I'm not helping. (all laugh)
Laura: Keyleth. I'm glad my brother found you. I'm glad we all found you.
Marisha: I'm glad I found you guys.
Laura: Love-love.
Marisha: Learned a lot from you, so thank you. She winked at me again.
Matt: As you guys make your way through the city towards the temple district of Emon, you find your way to the temple of Sarenrae, and as you begin to step on the outside, the door's already open, and knowingly awaiting, Pike steps out with a smile to greet you. (all cheer)
Ashley: It's okay! I just disappeared 'cause I was in the shimmery. I was the cotton candy. You didn't hurt me at all.
Travis: I like cotton candy.
Ashley: Yeah, but-- (all laugh)
Ashley: I shouldn't say-- I wasn't like that, then.
Travis: Oh, okay. I'm sorry if I hurt you.
Ashley: No, you didn't at all!
Travis: Okay.
Ashley: I didn't even feel it.
Travis: Wow, you are really getting strong.
Ashley: I just disappeared.
Travis: Yeah. You distappeared. (all laugh)
Ashley: Hi, everybody!
Taliesin: Hand over a big pile of seashell jewelry.
Ashley: What is this?
Taliesin: Now, there we are.
Marisha: Now you can wear it.
Ashley: Oh, yes! Ooh.
Taliesin: It fits, good. I was a little worried.
Marisha: He spent the entire time on the boat braiding macrame, it was crazy.
Taliesin: I've only got the medium glasses right now, so--
Marisha: He's getting into beading, it's odd. (all laugh)
Ashley: I give him a big hug.
Taliesin: Everybody needs a hobby.
Marisha: No, it's great.
Taliesin: Macrame might be mine.
Matt: Pike runs up and gives you a big hug.
Liam: Stress relief.
Ashley: I give him a big hug.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Ashley: Hello, Tary.
Sam: Hello, Pike. In the flesh, this time. I hope that you've seen that I've been doing as you asked every night.
Ashley: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Did we hear him say that?
Matt: Under his breath, yeah.
Taliesin: Okay.
Laura: I know, right?
Ashley: Natural 20.
Sam: Absolutely.
Matt: Yeah, telling the truth, straight up. There is a look of genuine awe and fear in his eyes when he looks at you.
Ashley: I'm very proud of you. You need to continue until you know it by heart.
Sam: I think I've learned their first names at least.
Ashley: I know. (all laugh)
Ashley: You have.
Travis: (deep voice) I know. (all laugh)
Sam: Well. What do we do now, fellows?
Marisha: To the keep?
Liam: Yeah, you wanna see where we live?
Laura: To the keep, we need to stop by the library.
Sam: Sure, yes, absolutely.
Laura: Yeah, let's go to Greyskull.
Taliesin: Give you a place to put down your things for a bit.
Marisha: Do you have the papers with you that you pulled from Raishan? Are those with us?
Matt: They're in the bag of holding.
Marisha: I'll help you research those.
Taliesin: Yeah, we'll do a bit of that.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: So you guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep--
Taliesin: I'll show you the other workshop.
Sam: (gasps) Ooh, there's something I need to tinker.
Taliesin: Oh, good. I actually need to talk to you about that.
Matt: Much to your joy, some of your original servants have returned from Whitestone. (all cheer)
Laura: Yay! Who all came back?
Matt: You do see within there, Laina and Erwin--
Liam: Holy shit!
Laura: I was so worried about them!
Matt: Laina greets you as you come up, she's like, "Oh goodness me, it's been so long, all of you. Well, come in, it's so good to see you. Well, as you were wandering about, we were all just keeping it down over there in Whitestone, but it's so nice to be back. This place, it needs some work. Please don't be judging, I'm trying to clean as best I can!" And the place looks pretty good, based on the last time you saw it, but there's still dust gathered around. She looks genuinely nervous, her hair's kind of wracked.
Laura: You're doing a great job.
Liam: We're all a bit of a work in progress, it's fine, dear.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: That's very fair.
Matt: She turns and Erwen comes up, you see him, you know, the very very old halfling male with his long gray ponytail. "And it is great to see all of you once more."
Marisha: Erwen!
Liam: Erwen.
Marisha: You're still alive!
Taliesin: Yeah, how did you manage?
Liam: We thought natural causes might, you know.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Which was very possible, yes."
Travis: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Yes, you may.
Travis: 19. No, is that a natural 20? It's a natural 20.
Ashley: That's a natural 20.
Marisha: Yeah, Gil!
Laura: Oh! He's coming over-- whispers about Erwen.
Sam: He is dead. He is a dead man.
Marisha: He's Hotis!
Liam: He has consumption.
Sam: Guys, use the code 'lootcrate' to get 10% off your monthly loot crate.
Travis: Well, I reach and I grab the dwarven thrower. Welcome back, you son of a bitch. (all laugh)
Liam: (Grog voice) And I crush him into jam.
Matt: "I must say, I greatly appreciate you all being so quick in getting us out of that whole dragon mess. I was rightfully frightened for my life. Anyway, I need to continue making your beds." And he slowly begins shuffling off towards the stairway.
Taliesin: Well.
Marisha: Aw.
Ashley: I love him.
Marisha: He's too good for us.
Ashley: Yeah.
Taliesin: That is unexpected.
Marisha: Yes, he's still alive.
Sam: So, this is your house?
Liam: This is our keep, man.
Marisha: Yes! This is where we would have dinner.
Taliesin: It's more of a summer home.
Marisha: Oh! And that's a giant portrait of one of our members who you haven't met, he made it riding on a unicorn. It's great. You should show him the basement.
Taliesin: Oh no, we're going to get there, but I figure we give him the full tour.
Travis: Are we gonna tell him the fucking name or what?
Laura: Yeah, it's Greyskull Keep.
Liam: Fool.
Sam: That's a really cool name.
Laura: I know, right?
Sam: Wow. That's excellent!
Taliesin: I've been thinking about redecorating.
Sam: Have you lived here very long, because there's--
Travis: It's on and off.
Taliesin: Well, summer home really.
Laura: Unfortunately, not too long.
Liam: We've been vacationing from it for a while.
Sam: You might want to consider different keepers of this place. It seems a bit--
Laura: There were fucking dragons, Tary!
Sam: All right.
Laura: Dragons!
Sam: You're right, it's just, I'm just not used to-
Taliesin: No, but if you have any input on decor or otherwise, we would be interested.
Sam: Lots of murals, lots of tapestries.
Taliesin: Oh, I would assume.
Travis: Most of the murals are of one of our friends, but yeah.
Taliesin: We'll vary it up a bit.
Liam: I don't know how long we're staying here, but you can have my old room. You got a room.
Sam: Where will you sleep?
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: In my old room. (all laugh)
Sam: All right, sure.
Laura: This is ridiculous.
Taliesin: It's good coffee today.
Matt: This is the second time Polymachina has come up in our campaign? Taryon and the two guards in Syngorn-- really confused. All right.
Taliesin: And I'll definitely show him the downstairs, and anytime you want to use the workshop downstairs-- it's a bit thin at the moment.
Matt: Yeah, most of the tools have been stolen.
Sam: Well, we'll have to go in town and buy some replacements for you.
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: You can make shit, though, what can you make?
Sam: Anything I set my mind to, if I have enough raw materials.
Liam: Hats?
Sam: Sure. You need a hat?
Taliesin: Invisibility?
Sam: Sure, I've done that before. I've given you invisibility coins.
Liam: Do you have a specialty? Do you do clothing, or--
Sam: Anything alchemic.
Taliesin: Teleportation?
Sam: I don't think I can do that, but anything that combines a little bit of magic with a little bit of engineering I can probably manage.
Liam: What about a beard trimmer?
Sam: A beard trimmer?
Liam: Yes.
Travis: What?
Liam: He's looking a little shaggy.
Taliesin: Death has changed you.
Sam: Sure, that seems like an easy thing to do. You seem pretty clean-shaven, though.
Liam: Yeah, I don't grow thick. It's pretty sparse, actually.
Laura: What?
Ashley: Whoopsie.
Laura: Uh.
Taliesin: Oh.
Liam: Dirty birds.
Laura: I go to the library.
Liam: Wait! Where're you going? I want to go to the library. Yeah, beard trimmer.
Sam: I'm on it.
Liam: I need a beard trimmer.
Sam: I'm on it, Vax.
Taliesin: Feel free to restock whatever's missing. Keyleth and I, I think at the very least, and maybe anybody else who wants to go upstairs and start poring through the wonderful private nooks and crannies of the library, please.
Travis: How are you going to do that, by the way?
Taliesin: Nooks and crannies?
Travis: Yeah, like, doesn't that require reading?
Taliesin: I've got-- well, they're not very good, are they?
Travis: No, they're not, are they?
Taliesin: Do I have any spare-- I don't have any spare glasses, do I?
Travis: What do you need?
Taliesin: I think I need the glasses.
Travis: What do you got?
Taliesin: Hm.
Laura: You already got his ascot, don't you?
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: Let me think about that for a moment. Carry on.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: Grog, did you steal Percy's glasses?
Travis: No, he actually gave them to me.
Ashley: Oh!
Travis: Yep. But I found out from Vex, that when you trade, you get something in return and last time, I got a title. Yep.
Ashley: You did?
Travis: Yeah I'm the Grand Doopa Babink of All Didedah. (all laugh)
Ashley: That sounds fun.
Travis: Yeah. It's a top secret title and it comes with all the land and money, and a bunch of short names.
Taliesin: I'm very quickly going to craft something super simple.
Matt: What're you crafting?
Ashley: Lands and money where?
Taliesin: I want to make a little foil pinwheel out of tin.
Travis: I don't know. Probably everywhere.
Matt: Yeah. Make a tinkering check.
Ashley: I always knew you were royalty.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: It's proficiency plus dex?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I can never remember. Well, you know, that's probably good enough. Let's see. 18?
Matt: You just didn't roll a one.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: You're fine. Yeah, you produce a-- with what little materials you have there-- raw materials left, you happily do so.
Taliesin: I have made a tiny pinwheel. It spins. And it's made of metal.
Marisha: I do a little gust cantrip to blow it.
Taliesin: And I put it on your lapel or your little strap that counts as a-- I just put it in a belt loop.
Ashley: That's the cutest thing.
Travis: Am I a fucking child?
Taliesin: Now you know if there's wind blowing. This is what I had I'm really like-- I'll give the glasses back when I'm done with them. This is a rental charge.
Travis: Because of my high office, I will forgive this offense. Come back when you're serious. Cloak of smashing, title, whatever. I'm sure you're very smart. You'll think of something.
Marisha: You want another title?
Travis: I'll keep this as a deposit though. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Shit.
Marisha: Just give him another title.
Taliesin: Oh dear.
Matt: All right, so you guys go to the library. What're you looking for specifically?
Laura: What're we doing? Researching something. Hotis? And like the Nine Hells.
Liam: Hell.
Matt: Investigation check.
Liam: Orcus?
Laura: All of it. Ooh! 26!
Liam: Which one are we doing?
Laura: Investigation.
Liam: Investigation?
Taliesin: I'm just going to help with the spines of books at this point.
Liam: 23.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Damn it!
Marisha: Yeah I'll do the reading for Percy until he gets his glasses back.
Matt: There you go. You're hard-pressed to find anything in your library that gets very specific. There are mythological mentions of the Nine Hells, of multiple layers, of demon princes. But the books that you have at your disposal largely speak about them like a fairy tale. Or talk about historical mentions of them through the history of Exandria, of the betrayer gods, and the old age of arcanum days. But nothing specifically about the hells. So even with the research, you just don't have those books in the keep.
Laura: We got to go somewhere better.
Liam: Vasselheim. Isn't there a library there?
Laura: There's a library here. The Cobalt Reserve. It was just kind of smashed, but I wonder if there's still books there.
Liam: Is it blown to shit?
Matt: The Cobalt Reserve is in Westruun.
Laura: Just kidding. It's in Westruun.
Matt: But it is essentially the largest collection of the most dense and sacred books on the continent.
Liam: Hey, that's a good idea you just had.
Laura: Hey!
Liam: In Westruun.
Laura: I was just wrong about, yeah, the city. That's it.
Liam: Well shit, all right.
Laura: What do you think?
Liam: Well, I don't think we should go charging into the Nine Hells like we did the ocean.
Laura: No. (laughs)
Taliesin: When you put it like that.
Liam: Yeah, let's try to prepare better.
Laura: Shall we go to Westruun?
Liam: Yeah. Maybe not today.
Laura: No.
Liam: We just got here. But yeah.
Laura: That's where we'll go to?
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Yeah? Tight? Tight?
Taliesin: A'ight.
Marisha: We're reading papers from Raishan's.
Taliesin: Also, yeah.
Matt: So you're pulling some of the notes you had gathered-- what languages do you guys speak?
Marisha: I speak Primordial.
Matt: Speak or read.
Marisha: And, well.
Taliesin: High-school Spanish.
Marisha: Primordial, Druidic, Sylvan, Elven.
Taliesin: Common, Celestial, Elven.
Matt: Right.
Laura: Draconic, Abyssal.
Matt: Most of these notes you cannot read. The language you've-- Percival, you recognize the script. A lot of them are written in Abyssal.
Taliesin: All right.
Laura: I can read Abyssal.
Liam: We read Abyssal, we studied it in school.
Matt: Right, so do you go and call their help?
Taliesin: Who reads Abyssal? I can't-- who reads at all. This is all out of focus.
Laura: I read Abyssal.
Liam: Oh, do you need help reading a book, Percival?
Laura: Do you need help because we both speak Abyssal?
Marisha: Grog stole his glasses, go easy on him.
Sam: That's cool.
Travis: I did not steal. They were a gift.
Liam: Excuse, me but this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment for me.
Taliesin: Are you enjoying yourself?
Liam: Do you-- immensely.
Taliesin: This is my gift to you. Happy Rebirthday.
Liam: Thank you, Freddie. Have a seat, let me translate for you. And a very merry Unbirthday to you.
Taliesin: I'm glad I let Grog hit you 'cause I know it hurt more.
Matt: All right, so you glance through some of the notes that were gathered. A lot of them appear to be almost gibberish in the order of words. They don't make sense. Or at least--
Liam: In Abyssal, the verb goes at the end of the sentence, which is different than in Common. You might not have known that.
Matt: You do make up some of them are historical discussions on the roots of powerful magic. Elements during the founding, they're mentioned a few times. They speak of the original Titans, it's a lot of very similarly and type-dense scattered notes. Some of the books that you pull are specifically arcane spellbooks, but they're also written in Abyssal. And as neither of you are practitioners of arcane magic, you have no idea what they say, you just recognize them to be sort of spell markings.
Liam: That's some bullshit.
Marisha: Don't say those things out loud.
Matt: There is the one large dark leather tome that is still locked on the side, and that was what was on the--
Laura: Right. That one feels, is like super scary-looking, though, right?
Matt: Of all the books, it looks like probably the premium book of Opash's collection.
Laura: Does it have writing on the cover?
Matt: It has no writing on the cover. It is just a dark black, leather-bound tome roughly that big that looks like it's weathered, scratched in places. It has kind of like a deep, metallic cornered trimmed bits to it.
Laura: But Gilmore looked at that. I had Gilmore look at it and he said it was scary.
Matt: He said whoever decides to read it should be strong of will. That was his warning.
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: Yeah, a lock on a book is one of those universal titles that make sense in any language.
Laura: Question.
Matt: Yes?
Laura: DM? What would will-- is that wisdom?
Matt: That's like wisdom modifier.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Generally, like wisdom saving throw. That's generally the kind of willpower tests elements of it.
Liam: Did Shaun say to read it or to open it, do we remember?
Laura: He said whoever read it had to be careful.
Matt: Read it.
Liam: Okay. Do I see any kind of trap to the lock?
Matt: Investigation check.
Taliesin: Are we going there?
Liam: No, I'm just checking, I'm not opening it.
Laura: Whoa! Pike should read it.
Matt: If you wish to.
Liam: That's fine.
Travis: Pike should read it.
Liam: Perception you said? 22.
Laura: Pike's got crazy wisdom, we should make her look at it.
Matt: 22? It does not appear to be trapped, it is locked though.
Liam: Okay. I will-- do we want to crack this shit open now?
Travis: Yes! Absolutely.
Laura: I mean, maybe Pike should look at it.
Liam: Yeah, I'm not gonna fucking read it, I'm just gonna open it for Pike.
Marisha: Did you detect any traps?
Liam: I didn't. Seems all right.
Marisha: Can I do Detect Magic on it? Sorry.
Sam: Can I-- no, it's fine.
Matt: You've already been told that it's magical from Gilmore earlier.
Laura: Gilmore looked at it.
Sam: Can I cast Identify on the lock or something?
Laura: On the book?
Liam: Or on the book.
Matt: That's essentially what Gilmore did. It's not a magical item with abilities or powers. It just has a magical essence to it and it's ancient.
Laura: We should have Pike look at this.
Travis: Yup.
Laura: Pike! Look at this.
Liam: I'm gonna try to unlock it.
Laura: Wait, wait, I just wanted to-- oh god.
Matt: All right, make a lock-picking check.
Liam: Well no, is there anything you want to do, Pike, before I open it?
Laura: It's just a dark book, we found it in Raishan, well in--
Matt: Opash's slash Thordak's lair.
Laura: Opash's lair.
Marisha: Slash Raishan's.
Taliesin: It's a locked book of unspeakable evil.
Laura: Gilmore said to be careful of it.
Travis: It's made from, like, flesh?
Sam: Do you fellows think that it will explode, or something bad, when we open it?
Taliesin: Oh, god, if that's all--
Laura: We're just sort of afraid it will take over someone's mind or something.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Why don't we have Doty open it?
Marisha: What's your will, Pike? Your wisdom?
Taliesin: What's Doty's willpower?
Sam: I dunno, it doesn't matter. If he breaks, I'll fix him.
Ashley: It would be considered saving-- you would add your saving throw wisdom?
Matt: We'll find out.
Laura: Ohh.
Marisha: Can I assist Pike in some way since we're both wise as fuck?
Matt: You guys could both attempt to read it together and you'd both have to possibly be tested.
Ashley: Tested?
Matt: That's your call.
Sam: Wow.
Marisha: My saving throw modifier is plus 11.
Laura: Pike is really, really wise.
Sam: Wow.
Liam: All right, so, hold on a minute.
Ashley: Oh, shit.
Marisha: -- and my regular modifier is plus six.
Matt: What are we doing?
Liam: Hold on a minute. I'm gonna unlock it. I'm not even gonna open it. I'm just gonna unlock it. So I get between everybody and the book.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Close your eyes as soon as you unlock it.
Liam: Okay.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: That is a-- That's fine. That's a 26.
Matt: It opens.
Liam: Okay, hold on.
Laura: I back away.
Sam: Ooh.
Liam: Hold on.
Matt: The latch opens, not the book.
Liam: Hold on. Keyleth, Pike, Vex, c'mere.
Laura: I'm in the doorway, man.
Taliesin: I can't read it anyway.
Ashley: We can do it.
Marisha: I go up. I go up.
Ashley: We can do it together.
Travis: Yeah, just you two.
Marisha: I don't know, I don't know.
Liam: I cast Bless on Pickle, on Keyleth, and my twin's far away, so I guess on myself.
Ashley: What do we get?
Liam: And then I step behind the girls--
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: Okay.
Liam: -- and watch.
Matt: All right. Who's doing what?
Travis: Oh no, look at that face. Holy shit, look--
Laura: Oh no, what's that face? What's that face?
Travis: Look at that forehead. That's like an F5 tornado rolling in.
Sam: Three people reading a book.
Ashley: Should we have Doty open it?
Sam: It doesn't get any more intense. (all laugh)
Marisha: This is what you tuned in for.
Travis: Let's not turn this into burying the shoebox. It's just a book, let's just read it.
Ashley: Should we have Doty look at it? We wouldn't be able to tell.
Taliesin: That didn't work out.
Sam: You seem much more powerful than Doty ever will be.
Travis: He's also not alive.
Laura: Yeah, do it. Do it!
Liam: All right, then.
Laura: I mean, do it if you want to. I'm standing in the doorway.
Marisha: Okay, all right, all right, if you wanna read it, I will go over your shoulder and be on the ready in case anything bad happens.
Sam: In a way, the cover of a book is kind of like a door.
Laura: A little bit.
Marisha: It's true.
Matt: (laughs)
Sam: So we're facing another door.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: All right, what?
Ashley: I'm going to--
Liam: Trying to earn points with us, or what?
Sam: (laughs)
Ashley: -- take my quill.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: And I'm just gonna peek it open, just a little bit.
Matt: Okay. You peek it open.
Sam: (slamming noise)
Ashley: Anything happens?
Matt: Nah, just the top creaks open.
Sam: Bikini islands.
Taliesin: This'll be like the end of the second act--
Ashley: Flip it open.
Taliesin: -- the second act of Ghostbusters.
Matt: The top of the tome flips open. Couple pages go like (fwoosh) kinda stuck to it, and then fall back into place.
Liam: Do a jump scare.
Ashley: (spooky groaning noise)
Marisha: Fall back into place? Why? What?
Laura: Well, it's just open, it's just an open book.
Matt: The pages kinda like curl back in, almost like they were stuck to the--
Marisha: Okay. Nothing weird.
Matt: Nothing weird.
Laura: Just air.
Marisha: Just air, yeah, just a draft.
Matt: A little bit of dust kinda like (swoosh) off the bottom of it. The pages are old. You see a little bit of text drawn on it.
Laura: What does it say? What is it? What does it look like?
Matt: What languages do you know, Pike?
Liam: Shush.
Ashley: Gnomish, Common, Underdark, Undercommon, Dwarvish.
Liam: Ooh.
Matt: You do not recognize the text.
Ashley: I can't read it.
Liam: Is it Abyssal?
Laura: Shit.
Matt: It is Abyssal.
Laura: Aw, fuck.
Marisha: You are the only ones who can speak Abyssal.
Sam: (laughs) That reaction.
Laura: Oh, no.
Travis: Time to die.
Liam: I'll do it.
Laura: What? Lemme see-- how much-- how wise are you?
Marisha: Okay, all right--
Travis: I approve of this decision-making.
Marisha: -- hang on, hang on.
Ashley: Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
Laura: You're not even as wise as I am.
Marisha: Who wants to read it? I can--
Liam: That's very subjective!
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: I'll enhance your ability.
Taliesin: Do you act--
Matt: Enhance does not really help with saving throws. Just so you know.
Ashley: I'll cast Bless--
Liam: I already did that.
Matt: Just ability checks. If it's an ability check, it'll help.
Liam: I Blessed myself.
Matt: But just so you know.
Marisha: Can I do anything--
Matt: That's up to you.
Sam: Turn into a dragon. (all laugh)
Laura: I'm gonna step up.
Marisha: I just eat the book!
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: (burps)
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: I'm gonna go up and try to look at it.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I'm gonna cast Bless on her.
Marisha: Who's reading?
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Are you reading?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So.
Marisha: I cast Enhance Ability on her and give her, I think it's Owl's Wisdom.
Matt: Sure, all right.
Laura: Ooh!
Liam: Ooh!
Taliesin: I run over, I give you a quick kiss. I say, if you turn evil, it's still cool. Just so you know. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. So, Vex.
Laura: Yeah?
Matt: You begin to glance through the pages and the words form around you, and you get a ways into it, and it's interesting. This is a personal notebook. It's a tome, but this is written by Opash, this is--
Laura: This is a gir-nal.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs)
Sam: (blows raspberry)
Taliesin: Whoa.
Sam: (laughs)
Liam: Well done. Well done.
Matt: This goes into Opash's history on Marquet during the Age of Arcanum, a lot of the terrible experiments that he was currently working on that dealt with rending and capturing the soul.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Capturing the servants and people that wandered the desert and would just-- had a series of caverns across the continent that were--
Marisha: (sneezes)
Taliesin: Bless you.
Matt: -- his to use, where he kept these individuals trapped in gems or glass menagerie-type structures where he would come back at his whim and just destroy souls, shatter them, corrupt them, forge them into things, feed on them. He was fascinated with the never-ending essence of existence and how to manipulate it and make it his own. It goes into that. It goes into people that didn't understand him in Marquet; how he was driven out, the trials that were put against him, his banishment to the island. And then in learning about the facet of this island that there's something about the metal here, something very ancient about this island that becomes this black hole of arcane projection. Astral Projection is not possible from the island, he discovered as he attempted that. And travel magics that go to or from the island have a very difficult ability to escape it, if not get very messed up in the process.
Marisha: We learned that.
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: However, it talks about how, when he was banished there, he discovered the indigenous people and those that lived on nearby islands that would take small ships from island to island, and there was a trade route there. He convinced and corrupted them to come and work for him, and such, he brought the entire civilization from these multiple islands to come live on this island under him. And then he reaved them all to become his experiments to continue here on this island. And you get a sense, reading through, that the masses of people you saw within that giant chasm that were clawing at you as you passed, those were all the people that used to live on these islands.
Laura: Oh my gosh!
Ashley: Oh my gosh!
Matt: You then also discover a few different chapters. One that mentions finding a near-dead dragon that washes on shore, a red dragon on the cusp of death. And what a great gift it is, to discover, to toy with the soul of an ancient entity like this. And it speaks of years of enslaving this red dragon and torturing and extracting information and manipulating and making it his own toy. And then, began to pull together research he had read elsewhere on the continuation of a dragon's soul, of being able to take the spirit of a dragon and make it indestructible and to live from body to body. And if he could find a way to correct this to work for himself it wouldn't be-- his power would continue without the binds of lichdom that a lot of other type magics would eventually be bound to-- the phylactery element, through a dragon transition would be a lot easier to maintain, and his hope for doing so. It beings to speak of a ritual, one that involved this ancient, ancient entity dragon called Guuthal the Ever-Fed. A mighty black dragon that was instilled with necromantic power that terrorized the world during the Age of Arcanum in its first millennia. Guuthal had used ritualistic aid, forbidden rites, and sacrifice of its own lifeforce to be born again as this never-dying new form of unlife referred to as a dracolich. However, the last few notes in Opash's hand end abruptly and a new handwriting in Draconic begins.
Laura: Which I also read.
Matt: Which you also read. These notes are less poetic and speaking to itself in the way Opash was by himself and needed somebody to converse with, and he chose his words. This is a much more direct, trying to piece together parts of an equation. And you start seeing references to J'mon Sa Ord, you see references to being the king that rises from the ashes. You begin to realize that these are the words of Thordak. This was the moment when Thordak overtook Opash, destroyed him, and made the lair his own. This history then goes into Thordak's interest in trying to find power to take this ritual unto himself and thus become an undying entity. The notes finish with the intent of Thordak going north to seek out mages, to seek out power, things he could bind to his will and bring them back to make this ritual happen. That's the last passage you see. You begin to realize that the knowledge that Thordak had, and was holding from Raishan, was the knowledge of this ritual that would probably be what would enable her to bypass the curse that she had.
Laura: Oh my gosh. But we killed her.
Matt: But you killed her.
Laura: This could have been so much worse.
Marisha: Yes, it could've.
Matt: I also need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
Sam: Ooh, shnikies!
Ashley: Can I--
Liam: Bless, bless, bless.
Travis: Can I--
Laura: What does Bless do?
Ashley: Can I also cast Beacon of Hope on her?
Sam: It's like inspiration.
Laura: Don't fuck me, Gil!
Matt: What's Beacon of Hope do?
Ashley: Beacon of Hope gives you advantage on wisdom saving throws.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, tight.
Matt: So, Beacon of Hope is cast.
Liam: It's already good.
Laura: Okay, 16.
Liam: Roll a d4 and add it.
Laura: It's just saving throw?
Matt: Saving throw, yes.
Laura: 18 + 3 is 21, plus two.
Liam: What does that Owl's Wisdom do?
Laura: 23.
Marisha: Huh?
Liam: What does Owl's Wisdom do?
Marisha: It gives you advantage on wisdom checks.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: Not saving throws.
Matt: Not saving throws. So, as you're reading through this, you guys watch as Vex's attention--
Laura: Oh wait, (whispers) 18, 19, 20, 23 (louder) 25.
Matt: 25, okay.
Laura: Oh no, that's a 16, I'm sorry! I was right, it was 23. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm a dick!
Matt: As you are reading through this, and you go through, you watch as she turns the pages faster and faster and her eyes unblinkingly are just scanning the pages with rapid pace. And, Vex, you feel this cold essence begin to curl through your shoulders and into the back of the neck and right as you finish the last bit of notes before Thordak, you feel something try to reach for the back of your mind. Cold fingers, ten, 20, an endless supply of grasping fingers reach for the back of your mind. And you shrug it off and pull yourself away from the book and the cold fades.
Laura: I shut the book.
Marisha: You all right?
Laura: Great.
Travis: Bad story?
Laura: I tell them everything I read.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Super fast 'cause I'm, like, a speed reader it's no big deal.
Liam: You were reading for like 25 minutes.
Laura: Oh shit! Well, it was a big journal.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: It's amazing. Anastasia Steele fell in love with Christian Grey just like that? Amazing! (all laugh)
Travis: Jesus Christ.
Taliesin: It's a knockout.
Travis: Oh my god.
Taliesin: Wow, now I can feel the fingers in the back of my head. (all laugh)
Matt: All the rest of us making a wisdom saving throw!
Taliesin: Damn it.
Sam: I know Laura read that.
Laura: I read most of it and then I just threw the book away.
Taliesin: Pike, can we destroy this thing?
Ashley: That was--
Laura: Well--
Ashley: -- what I was going to see if we--
Laura: Should we destroy this thing? I feel like maybe, I mean--
Taliesin: The knowledge exists now.
Laura: It's true.
Taliesin: It's outside the book, and if the book was-- there's something in there.
Marisha: Can we have Doty copy down everything that you just said?
Taliesin: Oh! Oh!
Liam: She said.
Marisha: Not actually exact transcriptions, just so we keep the knowledge.
Taliesin: Transcription of the story.
Sam: I mean, sure, he can record what her report is if you like, sure, yes.
Taliesin: It would be invaluable.
Laura: All right.
Matt: Doty walks over to one of the nearby shelves and finds one of the books that is only partially written in, tears out all the pages--
Laura: Okay, no, okay.
Taliesin: That was--
Laura: That's something.
Matt: -- and just begins transcribing from memory what you just said.
Marisha: High school notes?
Taliesin: No, that was a sea captain's journal. It's okay, it doesn't matter, it's not--
Sam: He didn't burn them, we could just--
Travis: Are we doing that now? I mean, I can help him, just--
Laura: No, Grog!
Taliesin: No no no no no!
Travis: And I just rip--
Laura: Should we destroy-destroy this?
Taliesin: I think so.
Sam: It's magical of some sort?
Laura: It certainly felt like something was trying to reach through.
Marisha: That doesn't sit well with me.
Laura: And what good does it do the world to know how to bring back souls as the undead? It seems kind of dark.
Sam: Do you lot have some sort of a vault here or something?
Travis: Do we?
Matt: You didn't have one made.
Marisha: We don't here; we do in Whitestone.
Taliesin: Even if there is a vault, all the vault is is a-- it's the one place in any city where everyone knows something valuable's kept.
Sam: A magical vault somewhere you could send this thing to be far away?
Laura: Well, we have a bag of holding.
Travis: Ooh! You know what? We could like send it into the plane where Craven Edge is and we'll take the sword out and put the book in in its place.
Taliesin: You know, I feel like there's someone collecting terrible things.
Laura: All terrible things.
Liam: We could throw it in the black spinny thing under Whitestone, or--
Laura: Oh no!
Liam: -- we could just give it to Allura.
Marisha: We were also going to go the Cobalt Reserve anyway, we could see, I'm sure they have some sort of a library special secret book vault.
Taliesin: I would feel all right with that.
Laura: Let's keep it in the bag of holding for the time being.
Travis: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's re-lock it.
Liam: Big responsibility.
Laura: Definitely.
Marisha: Re-lock it.
Laura: Re-lock it. Re-lock it.
Marisha: I vote we take it to the Cobalt Reserve.
Taliesin: I concur.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Do you concur? I concur.
Laura: I concur.
Taliesin: You concur?
Marisha: Either that, or Vasselheim. One of the two will have options, I'm sure.
Taliesin: I feel that the Cobalt Reserve will probably have some sort of situation for books like this.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: That seems reasonable.
Matt: So, what's the next step?
Laura: We're going to go to Westruun. Right?
Marisha: Did we go through all of the papers that Raishan and everything had, for the most part?
Matt: All those notes seemed to pertain to that book, and once you had the information from Vex, it kind of connected all the dots. A lot of these were notes regarding this ritual. Trying to find ways to break the chain of the life/death cycle and obsession with the alteration and harvesting of souls and spiritual energy for the use of powering arcane experimentation. So, not good stuff.
Marisha: He mentioned going north and looking for other powerful entities and objects to bind with. And then Raishan thought it would be a good idea to settle down in Whitestone.
Travis: Before we killed Raishan, didn't she say--
Laura: Well, Wildmount is far north. Raishan said she was from Wildmount.
Travis: Right. And she said she had found what she needed.
Matt: No, Raishan actually was from--
Taliesin: South.
Matt: -- she was south of Tal'Dorei.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: She was?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: She had an interest in Whitestone, which makes me wonder what the spinning black orb of death has to do with all of this. Because I'm still not convinced that it doesn't have some sort of play in everything.
Taliesin: It's just a spinning black orb of death sitting underneath my family home.
Laura: Dedicated to Vecna.
Taliesin: No. There's nothing-- I'm well aware that it's terrible. I don't know why you're staring at me like that. Yes, I think about it a lot. I'm--
Marisha: I'm just, you know--
Taliesin: I just don't know what to do about it.
Liam: Well, we can, well, not me, but smart people can devote more attention now that there's not five great dragons trying to tear the world apart.
Taliesin: We'll help.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: At this time, with you guys travelling through the city, getting here, with the research, I'd say it's getting pretty close to dusk. You probably have like an hour or so before the sun sets.
Marisha: You all want to rest? Take the night off, head to Westruun in the morning?
Laura: Sure.
Liam: Yeah. Back to the keep.
Taliesin: Back to the keep. We are in the keep.
Marisha: We are in the keep.
Matt: You are in the keep.
Liam: We stay in the keep.
Sam: Has Emon come back enough to have shops open for business or anything?
Matt: Yeah, I mean, not everything was destroyed. There are shops that are open and there are people running business here. I mean, a number of the districts got damaged and some buildings are having to be rebuilt, but it is still a functional city. Though to a lesser degree right now.
Marisha: You know, before we--
Taliesin: Did you want to shop now or later?
Sam: I don't want to waste time. Everything I do, I have to buy.
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: Well, we can shop in the morning, on the way out.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Sure. Yep.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's fair.
Laura: Not in a huge rush. Yeah.
Sam: I'm at your disposal.
Laura: We'll shop in Emon in the morning and then head out to Westruun. They'll have shops there, too. Just not as many.
Taliesin: Brunch.
Marisha: Brunch.
Sam: At dawn, we brunch.
Taliesin: At dawn, we brunch.
Liam: Please. Please.
Taliesin: No chicken.
Matt: As the sun sets across the Tal'Dorei sky, you all settle in for the evening to rest, contemplate the return of your ally. Your next venture in researching the path before you as Vox Machina. You to return soon to finish your Aramente to your people and see what lies ahead of you by the threads of fate wielded by the Raven Queen. At dawn, you brunch. And until then we'll return next week, with the next episode of Critical Role. (all cheer)
Laura: (sings) Everybody's still alive for the time being.
Liam: I really want brunch right now.
Taliesin: I just want brunch so badly.
Matt: I know.
Taliesin: I miss brunch.
Laura: Those donuts were pretty fucking great.
Matt: Well, guys, thank you for watching. Congratulations to our winner earlier. Thank you again, Loot Crate, for being our awesome sponsor.
All: Loot Crate!
Matt: What's that?
Crew: We did make it for Amandine.
Matt: We made it for Amandine! (cheers)
Matt: You guys are amazing. So we're going to go ahead and get her all the best legal work that we can to try and keep her in our midst. So thank you guys so much for being generous and helping out with that tremendously. Tremendously. It means a lot. Both to her and all of us here at Geek & Sundry so thank you. Thank you. Some of us-- I'll be returning tomorrow at noon for Eric's TBD RPG. Doctor Who. Which will be fun.
Taliesin: Doctor Whom.
Matt: With Darin De Paul. Doctor Whom. I'm sorry. You're right. And then all of us will be here on Saturday for the 24-hour two-year anniversary stream!
Laura: I don't know if all of us--
Taliesin: Many of us--
Matt: Many of us, many of us will be here on Saturday.
Marisha: Definitely Matt, Taliesin, and I, and maybe others?
Taliesin: Hey, you don't have to DM the Mansions for once!
Matt: That's true, 'cause the new edition.
Taliesin: Now Apple will do it for you.
Matt: It's wonderful. I was the Keeper almost every time for years. Big surprise, right?
Marisha: Yeah, I've been the Keeper a couple of times.
Matt: You did! Which is why I said "most".
Marisha: A few, though.
Matt: You were great. It was fun.
Taliesin: If we bring the expansion, you can still be Ashcan Pete, too.
Marisha: (rough voice) Oh, hell, yeah. Who can? Ashcan.
Taliesin: Ashcan Pete!
Matt: Ashcan Pete. He's the best.
Taliesin: Your Ashcan Pete makes me happy.
Matt: Anyway, guys, awesome work. Ashley, we love having you.
Travis: Yeah, Ashley!
Matt: Don't go back.
Ashley: I know! I don't want to!
Travis: Stay!
Ashley: I'm so close.
Matt: Yeah, we get you back soon.
Ashley: I have about three and a half to four weeks. And then I'll be home for a long time.
Laura: Yay!
Marisha: Can you do the Skype-y things with us next week? Do you know?
Sam: Don't pressure her.
Taliesin: No, no pressure!
Marisha: I'm allowed. Because I care.
Ashley: I don't know. I always hope so, but sometimes that's proven to be a little bit more difficult for some reason this season.
Laura: It's because they made your part so big this season.
Marisha: I know!
Ashley: Well, doh doh doh.
Laura: You're so talented and amazing.
Travis: You're the best!
Liam: Stupid innate ability.
Ashley: It's just-- No! It's just time change and things. (all laugh)
Matt: I know.
Ashley: I love being here, though.
Matt: I know. We miss you.
Ashley: Soon! So soon!
Matt: Soon. You'll be back soon. All right, guys--
Liam: Do we have an EMT and a stomach pump on hand for Sam? For after the show?
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Ashley: How's your tummy?
Sam: I ate a lot of sugar and caffeine at the beginning of this show. I feel very strange.
Taliesin: There's Big League Chew on the floor.
Sam: There is Big League Chew on the floor.
Taliesin: There's a little bit of Big League Chew.
Laura: Ugh, gross!
Matt: That is disgusting.
Sam: And probably in my lower intestine.
Taliesin: Wait, wait. Wait.
Laura: Do not touch that, Taliesin.
Marisha: No, no, Taliesin! Oh!
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: I'm never eating Big League Chew again.
Taliesin: Good, then something positive has come out of this.
Sam: It was purple flavor.
Laura: Ew.
Matt: Purple flavor?
Taliesin: That's not supposed to be purple.
Matt: Guys, thank you so much. We'll see you next week. Love to you all and is it Thursday yet? Good night, guys. [art]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Nice try, motherfuckers. (all laugh)
Matt: Anyway, welcome to tonight's episode. Before we get into it, we have some announcements to do really fast. First and foremost, getting to our fantastic sponsor for the evening. Returning: the glorious Loot Crate! Thank you so much, Loot Crate, for being fantastic and for being a sponsor for our show as long as you have! It's been awesome!
Sam: Hi, guys!
Matt: Hi, Sam.
Sam: Oh, you didn't throw it to me yet, did you?
Matt: No, but I can. Hey, Sam. Why don't you tell us about our sponsor?
Sam: Hey, as I tell you guys-- Hey, crew. By the way, crew as I tell you guys about Loot Crate, can you guys get a camera up here? I'm going to show some close-up things. Should have done that ahead of time. It's on its way. Okay. Loot Crate, the theme this week is Primal. Brands include X-Men, Overwatch, Predator, you can go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code CRITICALROLE for 10% off. And that's some severe savings. Just a few days left to catch this month's theme, so check it out. They're a great sponsor; we love them. They do so much for the show. We genuinely appreciate them. Okay, that being said-- and this will tie into Loot Crate, I promise-- I was thinking a lot this week about fan art. Are you on me? Whatever. Fan art.
Marisha: Where did that camera come from?
Sam: They're fast. So, we have amazing fan artists on this show. We get hundreds of art pieces every week. We're floored by them constantly: legitimately amazing artists. Talented, gifted. And I was like, "why should they get all the fun?" So I was like, "I'm going to do my own fan art this week!" Because things people know about me, I'm a talented performer and all that stuff, but I'm also an emerging visual artist. And this is a chance to get my art out to the world. And so I'm going to present it right now. Guys, this is art, so if you have any kind of a reaction that's real-- if you cry, if you clap, whatever. I'll take it.
Liam: Man. Joma, your time is over!
Sam: I'm going to start with Grog.
Laura: So good!
Sam: It's pretty good!
Laura: Did you really draw that?
Marisha: Let me see over here! Is that you? Did you do that?
Sam: Magic marker on paper.
Marisha: That's actually pretty good, man!
Laura: I like it!
Sam: I feel like I got his rage and his ferocity.
Taliesin: I'm feeling it.
Sam: Next up, she's hard  Keyleth.
Marisha: That's pretty good!
Sam: I did Keyleth. I should point out that all of these are signed and numbered by the artist.
Marisha: I have some fierce bone structure going.
Sam: You're hard. Lot of things going on.
Matt: I can see she's cast the 5th-level spell "Body to Forest."
Sam: I didn't know how to draw bodies! So I just went with grass!
Liam: Druids don't shave pits, man.
Sam: Truth be told, I was drinking, so things get a little worse as we go. So, this is Percy! It's a lot of white. I don't know how to paint with white or use white.
Liam: To be fair, so is Percy.
Sam: He's a white guy with white hair. I've got to work on this one. Next up, a guy who's near and dear to me. Here's Taryon Darrington. Little art tip here, guys: don't use blue pencil on blue paper because it tends not to show up. That's a free artist-to-artist tip for you guys.
Taliesin: Wait, you need to turn it back this way more. Oh, okay.
Sam: There is a drawing there.
Taliesin: Bold decisions.
Sam: It's just blue pencil on blue paper.
Matt: It's like one of the Magic Eye pictures. You have to really focus to see it.
Taliesin: I see a sailboat.
Sam: And then I was like, "The people are going to want Scanlan, right?" So this one took the most time. I will say this. Took about an hour. Mostly because I had to go to CVS to get more magic markers, so that was about 55 minutes of the time. And then the rest was hardcore art. And I feel like I really captured him. He's got a flute. He's got poop.
Marisha: I love that you broke rule number one of Pictionary and labeled things!
Sam: Okay, I'm going to do the twins next. Probably go a little wider because these will be side-by-side, all right? So you can really get the artistry. Okay, here they are.
Laura: Which one's which? (all laugh)
Sam: Some may argue that I photocopied Vax and put pink ribbons in her hair to be Vex. Some could argue that, and they would be correct. But you can also tell them apart because he's got a knife and she's got a little bow and arrow.
Travis: Are those arrows green?
Sam: I ran out of a lot of things, and I was drinking pretty heavily at this point, so I was probably fully drunk at this point. And then last, but not least. I mean, all together, I'd say probably an hour and a half it took me to do all these, including the CVS run. And last but not least, I'm most proud of Pike Trickfoot, ladies and gentlemen.
All: Whoa!
Sam: Now, again, you could say that I printed out her IMDB page and colored it in, and you'd be right, but it is also art, and I will stick by that. Now here's how this all ties into Loot Crate, guys.
Matt: It tied into The Dark Knight in that particular image.
Sam: I'm giving all of this art away tonight! I'm doing a contest, an unsanctioned contest that I'm running myself. So tonight, tweet me pictures of your Loot Crate stuff, like you and your Loot Crate shirt, or you holding a Loot Crate, or a screengrab of "I just subscribed to Loot Crate!" Tweet it to me with the hashtag #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage. (all laugh)
Sam: And I will, like a lottery, pick one at random to win all of this art signed by the artist. One-of-a-kind pieces that will certainly go up in value-- maybe even before I die! They will be worth a lot of money. And these are all going to a fabulous art collector out there. Thank you, Loot Crate! Thank you, artists! And that's it.
Taliesin: What are you?
Liam: Happy St. Pat's. That's the end of the episode, right?
Sam: You can pass them around. Share them, show them.
Marisha: When did you do these? Last night?
Sam: I think it was after you left my house last night.
Marisha: Are you serious? We left at midnight!
Sam: Yeah, it was eleven-something.
Taliesin: Is it my imagination that all of the half-elves kind of have the same weird chin thing going on?
Matt: It's consistent!
Sam: Yeah!
Taliesin: I will also say that I definitely get Ashley as the Joker threatening the city.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Millions will die.
Marisha: Why the pink lipstick, man?
Sam: That's what girls wear!
Marisha: Have you ever seen Ashley wear pink lipstick?
Sam: Yep. Girls wear pink lipstick.
Marisha: Although I appreciate her guns and her biceps.
Matt: She's a monstah.
Taliesin: She's like if The Joker had a daughter with Krondor.
Matt: Thank you, Sam.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Laura: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you, Loot Crate.
Taliesin: What's that hashtag again?
Sam: #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage
Matt: Okay, there we go. Remember that, guys. All right, merch update. Same old, same old, I'm pretty sure?
Laura: Merch update! There's merch still in the store!
Matt: Cool. You've got stickers, mugs, patches, bracelets, stuff like that.
Laura: All that stuff.
Matt: Logo shirts and the disturbingly comfortable "How do you want to do this?" hoodies up there.
Laura: It's true.
Matt: WonderCon! We're going to be at WonderCon doing a live Talks Machina panel on Saturday, April 1st from 2-3 PM Pacific at the arena at the Anaheim Convention Center. The big room. So fill it, Critters! Come on in! We have plenty of room and space for you guys. We want to try to show the convention that we are legion.
Marisha: Not an April Fools' joke!
Matt: We're actually going to be there.
Laura: This is legit.
Liam: It is an April Fools' joke.
Laura: No, it's not!
Matt: They gave us the big room and went, "You can't fill this," and we're like, "Yeah, we can." So we're trying to prove to them that we can fill the room. Come and join us, 2-3 PM.
Liam: Bring 4,000 of your closest friends.
Matt: Wednesday Club! Taliesin!
Taliesin: Yes! I missed this week because I realized, once again, that I'm supposed to be doing things other than playing D&D and actually working in the real world. So I missed this Wednesday Club, but I'll be back next week. I don't actually know what the subject is yet because I've done nothing other than this all week.
Sam: Fantastic Four!
Taliesin: Actually, probably not. We did Marvel last week.
Travis: Old Man Logan!
Taliesin: Maybe. No Marvel this week! We've got to let DC, and Image, and independent books may give a thing.
Travis: X-O Manowar!
Taliesin: X-O Manowar? You are a nerd, dude, whoa! Are you coming on?
Matt: How about just Manowar? The band.
Taliesin: I was going to say, will you come on our X-O Manowar show if we do one?
Travis: I don't know, man. I like football.
Taliesin: Okay. I love you. So yeah, there will be a Wednesday Club. Check out Twitter for updates, but I'll be back and it will be fun, and I'll be catching up on all my books.
Matt: Awesome. Next up, we have debuting on, I believe it's Sunday. This Sunday, March 19th, on Alpha we have Roundtable. Which is, essentially, a series where a bunch of various storytellers get together and talk about different themes about storytelling over drinks. It's actually pretty badass. This first season is Gamemasters. We have a collection of talented people from all over the webisphere running games.
Marisha: We went international!
Matt: Heck yeah. This first episode premieres Sunday. It's a conversation between me, Mark Humes of High Rollers, and Adam Koebel of Roll Play. So, if you want to check it out, it's on projectalpha.com.
Marisha: Pro-JECT Alpha.
Matt: Pro-JECT Alpha.
Marisha: Pro-JECT that Alpha.
Matt: It actually was a really awesome conversation. I'm pretty happy about it. We got a little tipsy. GM Tips episode went up today! It is my final run on GM Tips, but the series continues as I pass it off to a new host. If you haven't checked it out yet, our fantastic Satine Phoenix is picking up the torch to give her perspective as a game master for this next bit. She's awesome. This episode is specifically about how to avoid or deal with GM burnout, which is a topic that I think a lot of people are familiar with.
Liam: You don't have that, do you?
Matt: Huh? Not yet.
Travis: They make pharmaceuticals for that.
Matt: None. (laughs) Hopefully. No, but honestly, it's got some good tips for anyone out there who is feeling like they're starting to run a little ragged or a little sluggish. Check it out. Hope you like it. Signal Boost episode.
Marisha: Featuring Satine! Which we timed out pretty well. I think intentionally.
Taliesin: Maybe. Probably not.
Marisha: I'm not sure.
Matt: Nothing that works out well is intentional in our sphere.
Marisha: Totally intentionally. So if you don't know who Satine is, get introduced to her with this week's episode of Signal Boost, and then she'll lead you graciously into GM Tips.
Taliesin: It's the gothiest one since me, I think. Well, no, Jason Charles is pretty gothy.
Marisha: She's awesome. I have kind of a girl crush on Satine. She's so cool.
Taliesin: She's so cool.
Marisha: Yeah, you should go watch her.
Laura: Thanks, Matthew Mercer!
Matt: You're welcome. Updated Trinket stats.
Laura: (singsong) New Trinket stats!
Liam: He's got guns attached now! Gatling gun!
Laura: Yep, and a cannon.
Matt: Misfire score  20.
Liam: It shoots bees!
Matt: Yeah, and they all attack Trinket. It's bad. You don't want to use it. (all laugh)
Matt: (explosion noise) Right back into him. (bear grunting) Yes, and last but not least, Talks Machina live on Tuesdays, 7 PM, here on Twitch and Alpha. Brian Foster hosts every week. We talk about random shit about this, have guests from the community on-- check it out. It's a good time.
Marisha: And apparently he smells like cabbage.
Matt: Apparently, hashtag.
Sam: Getting a lot of great tweets already.
Matt: All right! That's the last of my announcements.
Sam: Are we doing the other thing?
Matt: Oh, that's right! I'm sorry! The Critical Role Fan Club on Facebook actually had a limerick contest to announce their 10,000th person joining it. And we had a winner. The winner is Tamiko L. Fujio. Sam, do you have a copy of the limerick?
Sam: I have a copy of the limerick in my inbox, right here.
Matt: I think you should read it off.
Sam: I'm going to read this limerick. They had their own internal contest, and this was the winner, and it's really awesome. Vox Machina is a fine troupe Who knock baddies and grannies for a loop Unless they encounter a door Then their plans are no more So instead they'll just scry with their poop. (all cheer and laugh)
Matt: Congratulations, Tamiko. That was awesome! Well done. And everyone leveled. Everyone's at 17 except for Tary, who's at 14. Congratulations.
Travis: Fucking dingleberry.
Marisha: (sings) 9th-level spells!
Laura: That Scanlan could've gotten.
Marisha: Yeah. (all laugh)
Matt: Anyway, let's go ahead and bring it into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [opening credits]
Matt: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'll remember that. Taryon apparently exploded.
Taliesin: Yeah, that happened.
Matt: Oh! There he is! Good job! (laughs) It's like you rushed here from work.
Sam: (whispers) Sorry!
Matt: That's okay. So. Bringing us into tonight's episode: Vox Machina, having completed the toppling and destruction of the Chroma Conclave, have now gone towards tying up the loose ends at the end of this massive journey that involved coming to the final stage of Keyleth's Aramente to prove to her people, the Ashari, that she is the proper next leader of the Zephra Air Ashari. You traveled far west across the Ozmit Sea after renting passage across a ship helmed by Captain Adela, and made your way to the island city of Vesrah, where you encountered Uvenda, Heart of the Tides, the leader of the Water Ashari, and put upon your final trial. You were sent into the subocean Aerie of Torrent where you were to retrieve lodestones in the constant threat of a kraken in the vicinity. Unfortunately, the kraken was triggered upon your attempt. A massive battle took place, one that claimed the life of Vax'ildan, and barely escaped with a success under your belt. You managed to bring his body back to the central temple at the top of Vesrah, and through bringing Pike's essence by a blessing through Sarenrae, complete a resurrection ritual that succeeded. Vax returns on his ever-dwindling borrowed time from the Raven Queen, it seems, thrusting himself into danger, but returns nonetheless. After this, you guys got some pictures drawn by Doty, as Pike intimidated him into learning your names in a wonderful method. You got passage on the ship back to Emon, where you have made your way back to Greyskull Keep. And that was where we left off, as you plan for the next leg of your venture. So. Picking up from there: as an evening rest comes to you all, a night of sleep. Vax, you have a difficult evening, tossing and turning in bed, the general ramifications of recent events surrounding you. Which, as a note, as a person who's back from resurrection, you are at a relative penalty for the next few days. I don't know if you were aware of that. Were you aware of that?
Travis: He is now.
Liam: I kind of remember people going through that.
Matt: Yep, so you have a night's rest after this, so that's-- actually, no. You traveled on a boat for a few days. That would have gone away! That's right, because you had to make a whole journey back to Emon, so you've rested up heavily in the boat. Forget I said anything.
Matt: But, tossing and turning as the night eventually takes you into subconsciousness, you are plagued with flashes of deep-sea darkness. Lashing tendrils. The ever-gaping maw, a beak swallowing you. The light fading. And there once again, you see emerging from the darkness the same expressionless, solid porcelain mask of the Raven Queen. The voice, omnipresent but gentle, strangely warming against the cold of nothing. And the voice just calls out, "I've given you back, my champion. But you are still mine. You have a purpose. Do not forget."
Liam: You know well that my heart lies with them. Both of them. All of them. But I have put my faith in you. And I await your word.
Matt: "And wait you shall. I sense something on the horizon. I sense rousing villainy. I sense twisting the threads of life, but it is too far beyond my vision. Only time will tell. But I've watched your thread. And it leads to something bright; it leads to something great. But your thread is still clouded at that point. I cannot see beyond. And as that thread moves, it gathers many around it: those you've come to love. Perhaps their fate is tied with yours. Is that a responsibility you can bear, Vax'ildan? Then be patient. Enjoy the time you have. For when this rousing evil gathers, I will need your full attention, my champion." The mask recedes back into the darkness, the cold overtakes you, and suddenly you find yourself shooting up in bed, gasping for breath. Sweat pours down your face just as a gentle bit of light begins to break over the sun coming through the window into the bedroom. Keyleth, you are roused out of your slumber as well, hearing him gasp and breathe heavily, leaning off the side of the bed.
Marisha: You okay?
Liam: Yeah. (coughs)
Marisha: Did you have a nightmare?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: I have them, too.
Liam: I know.
Marisha: Do you want to talk about it?
Liam: Eventually.
Marisha: Okay. Do you need anything?
Liam: I've everything I need.
Marisha: I do a little bit of Druidcraft, something like lightning bugs in the room, and make them dance. Nice and calming, just trying to get back to sleep.
Matt: Okay. You get--
Liam: We get an extra hour.
Matt: You guys curl up to get back to sleep, and as you do and the darkness takes you once more, you hear the faint echoing whisper in the back of your head as you fall back into your dreams, and it says, "My fate-touched." Now, the rest of you wake up the next morning. It's been a while since you've been back in Greyskull Keep, and it is strangely heartening to be back at home without another constant threat of death, without the looming of dragon destruction. And it brings back a flood of memories of when you first had this keep made, the innocence of those days and the things you've learned since, and the new appreciations you've gained through the struggles you've had in the process. The other thing catches you is the smell of fresh breakfast being made downstairs, as Laina apparently is already on task.
Travis: Fuck yeah. (all laugh)
Laura: I'll run downstairs. Can't miss that.
Marisha: As I wake up, before we head downstairs, I grab Vax. Did you get back to sleep? Are you all right?
Liam: Yes. You ready for the day?
Marisha: Never? Always. Yeah. No. Sure, let's go!
Liam: You're a born leader. Come on.
Marisha: Thanks.
Matt: You guys come down for breakfast. Laina is currently rushing around, seemingly excited at the prospect of being back in her kitchen, which has been outfitted partially. When she returned, as you know, most everything was stolen from the keep, and it looks like she's made a few trips into town and has purchased enough to make it functional. She comes out and she starts bringing meals; she has large piles of plates. "I'm really quite sorry, but we don't have enough plates for everyone, so if you don't mind sharing for now-- We'll go do some purchases."
Laura: I start grabbing bacon from the big piles.
Marisha: Yeah, same. Communal style.
Matt: "Good. Well, I hope it's okay."
Laura: It's perfect.
Taliesin: Oh, good. Plates. I'll have a plate.
Sam: I'll take one as well.
Liam: I reach in front of the boys and grab a big fistful.
Marisha: Half-elves are just, (gnawing noises).
Matt: As you guys are eating you hear some heavy footfalls coming from around the corner. The first thing you notice is a familiar female face. Once-short red hair has now grown quite long, or at least grown longer to about ear-, chin-length. You see Shayne Tranter, one of the guards that you originally hired and then moved over to Whitestone to guard, walk in, leather armor on, big pack over her shoulder, looks like she's also returned. As she comes in, she throws her pack down--
Marisha: Dwarf, right?
Matt: Human. Human female.
Marisha: Wrong note. Shayne Tranter?
Matt: Shayne Tranter, yeah. She walks in and throws her pack down. "Ah, good morning! Glad to see you're all mostly alive."
Travis: Did you eat already?
Matt: "No, is there food?"
Travis: Too bad, no.
Laura: Help yourself.
Taliesin: Grog, please, there is food.
Sam: But no plates.
Taliesin: But no plates.
Matt: "And you are?"
Sam: Oh, hi there! Just here for a visit. Taryon Darrington. You haven't heard of me yet, but you will. Do you work here? Are you one of our employees?
Matt: "I'm one of their employees, yes."
Sam: Oh, well. They made me an official member now, so.
Matt: "Great, so you'll be the one that pays me, then."
Laura: Oh!
Sam: We will all chip in for whatever your monthly wages will be.
Matt: "Unless I'm mistaken, and-- well, unless you canceled our contract. Mind you, we haven't been guarding the keep for a long time, so I'm not going charge you for the time over that, we appreciate you on that, but we are back on the clock, and this is kind of my only job at the moment, so--"
Laura: Start guarding.
Matt: "All right." And she smiles and sits down, and she grabs a little bit of food and pulls it off into her hand and starts eating off her leather gauntleted glove.
Laura: Taryon, you don't have to worry about paying on this.
Sam: How much do they cost?
Taliesin: A fortune.
Laura: I'm sure I have it written down somewhere. (all laugh)
Taliesin: We have books, there were books, we kept books.
Laura: Yeah, there were books! There was also a dragon attack.
Sam: I fully expect to be treated as a full, paying member of this and I will gladly contribute one-seventh of the salary.
Laura: Really not necessary.
Taliesin: It's quite all right.
Sam: I insist. It's literally nothing to me. (all laugh)
Travis: Someone should teach him the Vox Machina fight song, then.
Laura: You should do it, Grog.
Liam: Oh, yeah, Grog. You have the best voice of all of us.
Travis: Yeah. Do you know the fight song?
Sam: No, no, I've not learned any fight song. Most of the songs that I've learned are either religious in nature or I've read them in books and I've made up my own melodies to them. They were epic poems of yesteryear, and I sort of set them to a little melody, mostly happy--
Travis: You made up songs, then?
Sam: Well, I--
Travis: No, that's good. Each one of these songs is, like, personal, to the member, right? So you make up a song about what Vox Machina means to you.
Sam: I do that?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Travis: We'll need it by sundown tomorrow.
Sam: Doty, we have some work to do! Working breakfast.
Matt: Doty sits down right next to you.
Sam: Machina, Machina. "Sock in a." Put a sock in a-- no. Vox, Vox. Put it in the box. We'll work on this.
Laura: I'm scouring my notes for where I wrote their salaries down.
Taliesin: That was a long time ago.
Laura: It was, but I've got my spiral here.
Sam: They're 100 gold a month for five of them, and then 50 gold a month for the other two. That's Vex's memory.
Laura: That's my memory! 100 gold a month for each of the guards, and then what was the extra?
Sam: Five of them get 100 gold a month and two of them get 50 gold a month. I don't remember why or who, but that's how-- I think the guards get 100 and the cooks get 50, or something?
Matt: Servants get 50, yeah.
Marisha: See, as I wrote down, I believe Shayne, Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick, and Nitebe get 100 a month.
Laura: And then we always gave Jarett a bonus because he was captain.
Marisha: Yeah. And because he was hot.
Matt: Yeah. Well. There you go. Although Jarett is technically not on your payroll anymore. Jarett's now a member of the Pale Guard in Whitestone.
Laura: Yeah, I remember.
Marisha: That's right. So, reducing our costs. We're getting better at this.
Laura: Do you know where the rest of the crew is, Shayne?
Matt: "Kendrick is currently watching up on the wall. Nitebe, I haven't seen since you sent him off to Wildmount."
Laura: Right.
Matt: And she gets a distant stare for a second and says, "Well, Cordell didn't make it through the ordeal."
Taliesin: Really?
Matt: You can see her kind of-- she has that look of somebody who lost a close friend. She gets a distant stare for a second, clenches her jaw, and then shakes her head and goes back to eating absentmindedly.
Marisha: We should have some sort of service, then, or at least a dinner in Cordell's honor.
Matt: "That's up to you. I've already had mine. My piece has been said."
Laura: Well, we're glad to have you back.
Matt: "Me, too."
Taliesin: Glad so many of us survived.
Matt: "Not everyone."
Laura: Do any of us remember why Nitebe went to Wildmount?
Matt: You sent him a long time ago to look for information about the Briarwoods.
Taliesin: Oh no!
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: We made him a snack!
Laura: We did?
Travis: He turned into a Hot Pocket, y'all!
Taliesin: Did we fight his undead body in the crypt? Is that-- oh.
Matt: You have not crossed his path.
Laura: Oh no, we killed our guard?
Matt: You haven't heard anything from him in a long time.
Taliesin: Vox Machina, not returning your calls since 1992.
Marisha: Vox Machina, not returning your calls since 1992.
Matt: To be fair, spies, by nature, live a very dangerous lifestyle that they accept. Who knows what his whereabouts are or if he'll ever show up again, but you haven't heard from him.
Laura: Maybe he just took our money and ran?
Matt: It's also very possible.
Laura: I doubt it, though.
Taliesin: I would feel better about that, but probably not.
Marisha: I can try and scry.
Taliesin: I just like the notion that maybe if we just checked one more of those cells in the dungeon of Whitestone--
Marisha: Want me to scry on Nitebe? I can.
Taliesin: You know, I'll say just because I'm curious where this particular rabbit hole leads--
Travis: Really?
Laura: Maybe.
Taliesin: It's not like we're going to go wherever--
Travis: We're just eating breakfast. Go for it!
Laura: Yeah, just scry while we're eating breakfast.
Marisha: All right. I scry on Nitebe.
Liam: I like that this is our breakfast entertainment.
Taliesin: This is our version of looking at our phones. This is Vox Machina going--
Laura: What do you see? Has he posted anything on Facebook lately?
Travis: Have we figured out how to project this on a 55-inch flat wall monitor for us yet?
Marisha: Actually, good question!
Taliesin: Yes, but the frame rate is only 120 frames per second.
Marisha: Yeah, it's only in black and white.
Liam: He posted on Instagram six weeks ago and that was it.
Matt: All right. So, are you doing Scry on Nitebe?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: What do your scrying eyes see, Keyleth?
Matt: So as you eat your breakfast, you take a moment. You finish the small ritual on the center of the cold stone floor of your mess hall area of the keep. You focus on your fuzzy but decent enough memory of Nitebe. As the ritual completes, your vision focuses out for a second and then returns to you. There's no focus. There's no Nitebe.
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: He's a Jolly Rancher in the belly of Craven Edge!
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: I'm afraid the insane things that Grog just said is correct.
Travis: I am a powerful magician.
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: A happy ranch hand in the--
Travis: Yeah, he's on the farm! He's running through the fields of the farm, happy as can be. All the room to run he wants! (laughs)
Laura: This is actually very terrible.
Taliesin: This is really sad in the weirdest way.
Travis: I mean, yes. This is very dark, dark time.
Laura: That's terrible.
Marisha: Travis!
Taliesin: I know. I can't.
Liam: We're laughing at ourselves. We haven't thought of this guy in 72 years!
Taliesin: Pre-stream! It's been since pre-stream that this has come up.
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay. Wow.
Laura: Well.
Travis: Zero focus. Nothing.
Matt: There's no creature to receive the scrying spell.
Liam: My breakfast is not tasting as good.
Matt: Which means he's either on another plane of existence... or he's fucking dead! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Is that this version of "He's in the Feywild. Everything's fine right now."
Matt: You sent him to the great spy farm upstate.
Marisha: Whatever timeline you believe in.
Laura: At least we've avenged him, in a way.
Sam: Did he have a family? What was his mother's name? (all laugh)
Sam: Because we might want to send her a gift or some sort of a tribute in coin.
Laura: Yeah, I'll get right on that. Yeah.
Marisha: There's got to be public record, right?
Laura: Yeah. Yeah. Anywho. We're down a few servants, we should probably get some more guards. Hey, Shayne, do you have anyone you'd recommend?
Matt: "Honestly, me and Cordell worked as a team for a long time. We didn't really make friends. I can go looking in the city for you?"
Travis: No.
Laura: That's all right.
Taliesin: Keep your eyes open. We trust your judgment.
Matt: "Unless you want to go look for yourself? I don't mind going and finding some good candidates."
Laura: Find a few more?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: I feel like the city is pretty overwhelmed at the moment, though.
Matt: "Up to you."
Laura: A lot of keeps have been ruined. Guards might be looking for work, actually.
Matt: "Yeah. People looking for work right now. You look like you've got more important things to focus on, so if you want to hire some guards and you have trust in me, throw me some cash and I can probably bring some people in."
Marisha: How do you feel about your workload? Do you feel like you can handle this?
Matt: "I can handle it." She shakes the bit of scrambled eggs from her gauntleted hand.
Laura: Good leading. Good leading, Keyleth.
Travis: How's your keep bandwidth right now? Is your plate full?
Laura: This is shitty. Can I roll for insight and make sure that she's trustworthy? I feel like she's trustworthy, but--
Matt: Totally.
Laura: I rolled poorly for my insight--
Matt: What did you roll? Even if you roll poorly, with the bonuses.
Laura: 13?
Matt: 13. She seems pretty straight.
Laura: All right.
Matt: She's straight with you. She's not trying to layer it at all.
Taliesin: We've got a trip to take, so perhaps when we get back, we can audition some new candidates. That'll be fun. You'll enjoy that.
Sam: Yes! I would enjoy anything.
Taliesin: Oh, it's quite fun. It's quite nice.
Sam: I love me some fun.
Travis: Are you going to audition these new guards like we did you?
Matt: "Oh, I can figure something out. Don't worry."
Laura: I like it. Make sure they're trustworthy, if we're not going to be around. And I hand her 500 gold for herself and for Kendrick.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: And the three that you hire.
Matt: "All right. I'll get on it, then. I think I should have some time to go into town and do this here within the afternoon." She grabs another roll off the table and takes a bite of it. "Glad to have you back." And she turns around and leaves the room.
Travis: I like her.
Laura: She's cool.
Travis: Yep. Doesn't say too much.
Taliesin: Now I remember why we hired her in the first place.
Travis: Because she fought well! She fought a giant fucking scorpion in the courtyard. What are we doing today?
Marisha: Well, we talked about going to the Cobalt Reserve to drop off this--
Laura: To drop off the evil book and do a little research on the Nine fucking Hells.
Marisha: And then--
Taliesin: We need to do a bit of shopping, but then we do have-- you're not quite done, are you?
Marisha: I mean, there's that.
Taliesin: I'm putting it out there.
Liam: Yeah, you up for it?
Travis: What?
Laura: She's got to get crowned.
Travis: (laughs)
Taliesin: Wow! I watched that work its way from your ear all the way to your brain, there!
Travis: You're going to get crowned? Really?
Taliesin: It got lost on the way! It was amazing.
Laura: Even larger antlers?
Travis: Wow!
Marisha: Yeah, it's weird. I don't know.
Travis: Does it sit on your head, or on the antlers?
Taliesin: They decorate it, like a winter's festival.
Liam: They put antlers on the antlers.
Matt: You do actually know, though you've never seen anyone wear it, because in the time that you've been learning, there hasn't been a formal Voice of the Tempest, it's not a crown. It's more of a mantle. It's a ceremonial mantle.
Laura: So you just hold it like a giant mantle?
Marisha: Well, not like a fireplace mantle. Although I could, technically, transform into a fireplace now.
Travis: Why?
Marisha: Because I'm a badass.
Laura: (gasps) You could turn into doors!
Marisha: You know, I could, I'm pretty sure.
Matt: Creature!
Marisha: No, I could! Hang on, hang on!
Laura: A mimic!
Marisha: A mimic! Couldn't I turn into a mimic that could be a door? Or a mantle?
Matt: Well, you haven't seen a door mimic before. Because I don't hate you that much yet.
Liam: We haven't seen a base mimic before.
Laura: Yeah, we have!
Liam: In this game?
Matt: You have seen a mimic, yeah.
Liam: I don't remember it.
Matt: That was second session.
Liam: Ooh, shizz-nap!
Matt: Yeah. That was second. A mimic and a gelatinous cube in the same combat. I was like, "Hi guys! Welcome to D&D! (splat noise)"
Liam: That I remember, yeah.
Taliesin: Was I at that one?
Matt: No, you weren't at that one, unfortunately. That was before you came back to the campaign.
Marisha: Can I be a door?
Laura: I think it's a no.
Matt: I'll look at Shapechange.
Marisha: We'll think about it. Anyway.
Matt: I'm pretty sure it's just creatures.
Marisha: It's fine.
Laura: Okay! What are we fucking doing? What are we doing?
Matt: It's "different creature." If you encounter a door-shaped creature in the future, you can totally do that.
Taliesin: Please! I'm sure you're having all sorts of reservations and thoughts and processes about this notion, but I will admit, I have yet to introduce your sister to the best part of being titled, which is dressing up. And it would be a coronation! We could get some clothes! We could wear something lovely.
Liam: Does that jive with your hometown, though, Kiki? Dressing up?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: It's a sign of respect.
Travis: Do all people with titles have to dress up?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Are you sure?
Taliesin: I am.
Marisha: We're very open-minded.
Laura: Oh, Grand Poobah. I'm afraid you have to wear something quite formal.
Travis: You know what? Breakfast is disagreeing with me. I think I have to go back to bed.
Taliesin: Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
Travis: (gags) Yeah, I don't feel well. I've got to go. I go back up to my room.
Matt: (laughs) Grog storms off.
Laura: I really thought we were going to get him to bathe this time.
Marisha: Does he have an aversion to wearing pants?
Taliesin: I'm sure we can work out something without pants.
Laura: (laughs) Just a belt. A really glorious belt. Over the dwarven belt.
Marisha: All blinged out.
Liam: It's like a kilt that's barely joined at the bottom already. It's like a poopy diaper.
Taliesin: Just get him boots that go all the way up to the neck.
Liam: It literally is a poopy diaper.
Matt: Poopy diaper of dwarvenkind.
Laura: Gross!
Taliesin: Activate number one or number two.
Travis: Battle kilt.
Laura: Seriously, though, what are we doing?
Liam: Well, we're in town. We've got this book and a library, but we should decide what we're going to do tomorrow. What's to wait? Why don't we go home?
Marisha: (stammers) Well, it's just weird. It's just weird. It's been so long. It's a lot of build-up, and then it's going to be over.
Liam: You are adorable right now.
Marisha: I'm serious!
Laura: Maybe your dad will have information on the Nine Hells.
Marisha: He could, yeah. It's just, my whole life has been building up to this, and if we complete it, that makes it real.
Laura: Wait, I do have a question, actually. If you complete it, do they want you to stay?
Marisha: If I complete it, then I am the Voice of the Tempest. I imagine I can do whatever I want. Right?
Laura: Or you stay and lead your people.
Liam: Yeah. Does the Tempest go on road trips?
Marisha: I don't know.
Liam: Oh.
Taliesin: Has your life been leading up to this moment, or has your life been leading up to everything that happens after this moment?
Marisha: I'm not entirely sure of the difference of what you just said.
Taliesin: I'm just saying, as somebody who spent several years of their life avoiding the one thing that would make them even remotely happy, maybe just barreling through it is the way to go. We'll be there!
Marisha: I guess it is that notion of leading up to this one moment that you've thought of for a while. Once you complete that, what happens next?
Laura: It's just like getting married, Keyleth.
Marisha: Is it, though? Yeah?
Laura: It's all the planning. That just freaks you out, that's all.
Marisha: Yeah, sure.
Liam: What do you know about that?
Taliesin: I was going to say, is that theoretical or experiential?
Laura: Theoretical, obviously!
Taliesin: Okay. Just checking.
Liam: She does read a lot. Or she used to.
Taliesin: She still reads a lot.
Laura: I do! (laughs)
Liam: Are you sharing a library?
Taliesin: Lots of things.
Liam: Yeah, yeah. I don't need to hear about it.
Taliesin: No, you don't. That's why I was so excited that you pried.
Marisha: It's whatever you guys think is best. We can go to Westruun first, or we can go to Zephra first. Just whatever you want.
Liam: Oh, that's a big decision for you to make, I think.
Marisha: No, it's the difference of a day or two, right?
Matt: You hear the heavy footfalls upstairs of Grog's feet and a door slamming shut.
Taliesin: He took his time.
Marisha: Do we need an extra day to convince Grog to wear pants? That could be the deciding factor! Maybe we should put it on him. Right?
Laura: Keyleth!
Marisha: What?
Laura: Make a decision.
Marisha: (groans)
Laura: Leader. You're going to be a leader. Just make a choice.
Liam: Everybody else believes in you. Why shouldn't you?
Taliesin: Pencil or pen?
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: I'm looking forward to buying a dress either way.
Marisha: Let's check in at Westruun. Drop off the book.
Laura: And see how you feel.
Marisha: We'll head from Westruun to Zephra.
Laura: Good plan.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: You're going to be very good at this.
Marisha: Man! Decision-making is hard.
Taliesin: I know.
Marisha: So many choices.
Laura: So wait. (valley girl voice) Would the shops here be better to buy a dress than the shops in Westruun?
Taliesin: Wow!
Marisha: Good question! Who's importing more? Where's fashion week happening?
Liam: They're both handicapped, aren't they?
Laura: That's what I mean.
Matt: They've both been under some recent duress, so it really could go either way. Emon is definitely more of the cultural hub, especially since it's such a huge port town. You get a lot more cultural influence from other continents and heavier trade. Emon would probably have better outfits. But Westruun-- which, Grog, you grew up in, and you guys have spent some time in-- does have its own textiles district. There are weddings that happen there. They have other events where they sell fine--
Liam: What's Westruun like? Pittsburgh?
Matt: You could say, yeah.
Travis: It's like Wisconsin.
Taliesin: Okay, that's less disappointing.
Matt: Emon's the New York. Westruun's the Pittsburgh.
Taliesin: Whitestone's the Boulder.
Matt: Kind of, yeah! (laughs)
Taliesin: It's Boulder, Colorado.
Liam: Yeah, I like it!
Taliesin: There's nothing happening.
Travis: Boulder, baby.
Laura: But it's beautiful.
Marisha: If it's the Pittsburgh, then we should go now, because everything closes at five.
Liam: We could also Tree Stride to Vasselheim for the fanciest of shopping. If you want to go all-out.
Taliesin: In theory, they'll have your crest on file. That's one of those things, any dressmaker would actually know how to assemble something appropriate for any house of any nobility that exists.
Laura: You know what? Vasselheim will actually know a little bit about Orcus and I bet the Nine Hells, as well, being the god hub.
Taliesin: Ooh, a work vacation.
Marisha: We did mention if we wanted to drop off the book at Westruun or Vasselheim--
Laura: We should go to Vasselheim!
Marisha: Do we want to do that instead?
Laura: Decision's fucking made. Let's go.
Marisha: All right! Let's go to Vasselheim.
Sam: I've never been. That sounds great!
Marisha: How far north have you been, Tary?
Sam: Quite far north. Right? I'm from the north?
Marisha: You're from Wildmount, correct?
Matt: You're from Wildmount, which is-- as far as you know, from where you grew up, Tal'Dorei is to the southwest of where you grew up. Issylra, which is where Vasselheim is, and Othanzia is far to the east.
Liam: First there was the dinosaurs.
Sam: But I lived in the north of that place.
Matt: You lived in the north of Wildmount. It's pretty Siberian, you would consider it.
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: I want to go to there.
Sam: I thrive in cold places. Is this such a place?
Marisha: It is quite chilly.
Taliesin: Not as cold as my home, but it'll do.
Sam: I have some excellent cold-weather robes in my bag of holding that I would love to flaunt.
Laura: Let's go.
Marisha: Let's go.
Taliesin: We also probably need a few healing potions and such, and we'll probably have better luck somewhere else.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes!
Marisha: Anything else we need to do before we leave Emon?
Sam: They'll have potions and things there?
Taliesin: We probably need to stock up a bit.
Sam: Yes. They'll have these things at Vasselheim?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Great.
Travis: You don't just have some health potions in your armor? You can't just plink one out of your nutsack or something?
Sam: I'm going to reach onto my robe and pull out a patch that produces four healing potions.
Travis: What?!
Matt: There you go.
Laura: Are they regular, or are they greater?
Sam: They're regular.
Laura: Oh. All right.
Travis: That's great!
Laura: That's pretty cool.
Travis: Man! We should tear you apart limb from limb and see what fucking shakes out!
Sam: Please don't.
Liam: Does that regenerate and come back? Is it one time only?
Sam: No, but I'll just buy another one if I run out.
Travis: Another robe?
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Wow.
Taliesin: It's like a four-pack of medieval Five-Hour Energy drink.
Matt: Basically.
Sam: It's literally Monster Energy.
Taliesin: That's like a 1st-level healing potion.
Marisha: Tary, Vasselheim does get a little bit--
Liam: They don't like magic.
Sam: They don't like magic?
Laura: Arcane magic.
Marisha: Arcane magic.
Sam: I practice alchemic magic, mostly, so I'll be okay. I think.
Taliesin: You might want to keep a low profile.
Matt: Alchemical elements, yes. But a lot of your spells and infusing everything is arcane-based. And you have a giant arcane metal man following you around.
Sam: Oh! Maybe I should disguise Doty in some way.
Marisha: Can you do that?
Sam: No. (all laugh)
Sam: I can throw a cloth over him or--
Laura: Make him look like he's just a big dude wearing a robe with a hood over his head.
Taliesin: Or a ghost.
Sam: Or a ghost! Is it Halloween?
Marisha: I don't think so.
Taliesin: It is sadly not Hallow's Eve. We can put him in some armor or some fake cloth of some sort.
Laura: Let's just put a robe over him.
Sam: Could you and I craft something for him before the journey, like a face mask of some sort that makes him look like a brave warrior?
Liam: I mean, I am really good at disguises. I haven't flexed those muscles in a while, but--
Laura: Let him give it a go.
Sam: You can make disguises?
Liam: I can work with a little bit of nose putty, and yeah, I can make a fake face for this guy.
Sam: That I would love to see.
Matt: As best as you understand, it isn't like, "Oh my god, there's some sort of magic source in Vasselhiem, arrest everyone involved." It's not super illegal, it's just generally frowned upon and calls suspicion.
Sam: No, I want to pursue you making a mask for Doty.
Liam: So do I. I feel really rusty.
Laura: I want to help him because I'm a rogue, too.
Taliesin: Well let's go full Cinderella on this. Let's get all the mice involved.
Liam: What do we want this guy to look like?
Sam: Well, I mean, there's no disguising the fact that he's eight feet tall and squeaks when he walks. (all laugh)
Liam: Should we turn him into a goliath, then?
Sam: I mean, are we going to do full body paint for this?
Laura: What if we just put a stealth cloak over him or something?
Liam: Stealth cloak? Do you have a stealth cloak?
Laura: Yeah, then paint his-- yeah, I do.
Taliesin: Let's make him look like a goliath that wears a lot of robes because he was horribly scarred.
Laura: I start taking robes out.
Taliesin: Grog, how do you feel about this? I feel like you have the look--
Laura: Grog's upstairs.
Taliesin: Oh, you're upstairs, you're not actually here. Never mind.
Marisha: He's upset about the notion of pants.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: Making him look like he is in a suit of armor seems like a thing.
Taliesin: We could put him in a suit of armor.
Sam: He's already metal.
Laura: Fine. I take all of the robes off. Do whatever you want.
Taliesin: Is Doty strong enough to wear a suit of armor?
Sam: He's strong.
Matt: I mean, decorative.
Taliesin: Yes, decorative.
Matt: Yeah. Doty is his own suit of armor.
Laura: Why are we doing this?
Taliesin: Because this is funny.
Matt: Because it's amazing.
Travis: He's a giant automaton!
Laura: Just wear a robe!
Taliesin: I'm having a wonderful time.
Sam: I want Doty with a fake nose. That's all I want.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, do that!
Taliesin: Groucho Marx nose and glasses. (all laugh)
Liam: I'm going to need your help because I'm not used to working on robots. You can make some mesh work, right? And we can get some clay, and some spectacles like yours, but maybe shaded. Yeah?
Travis: He's only got the one pair now.
Taliesin: We can make him a mask at the very least.
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: All right.
Liam: I have made masks for myself.
Marisha: This is going to look ridiculous!
Matt: I'm so excited.
Marisha: Everyone's going to be like, that's a robot wearing a mask!
Taliesin: No, it's just a man with no arms, legs, heads, limbs and chest.
Liam: We don't have to, I mean--
Taliesin: No, we're doing it.
Sam: Let's spend some time.
Taliesin: Everyone else can get their little run-around of Westruun done while we sit making a robot.
Matt: Okay. So, Vax, needing materials to prepare such an elaborate--
Liam: Hey, give me some money. I don't have any money. I never have money.
Laura: You need money to go buy a stupid mask for a stupid robot?
Liam: This is the first time in this entire goddamn campaign--
Laura: No, it's not.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Laura: No, it isn't.
Liam: Give me some fucking money.
Sam: Or, I can give you money.
Liam: I want her money.
Sam: All right.
Liam: Thanks.
Taliesin: It is important for him to express himself.
Laura: I have passed out money lately, before, I think.
Liam: I throw myself off of things for this one, she can't give me 50 gold pieces.
Laura: Fine!
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: How about everybody gets a thousand gold.
Liam: It's a party!
Travis: Really?
Laura: Yeah, everybody take a thousand gold.
Sam: Me too?
Laura: Except for you. (all laugh)
Liam: Hey, Matt?
Matt: Yeah?
Liam: Do I have this ability? I feel like I remember it, but I'm looking through--
Travis: You don't know?! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Oh no!
Matt: I'm pretty sure you do! I think you have a disguise kit. It's not an ability per se.
Liam: I have Imposter, right?
Matt: Right, you have Imposter.
Liam: That's me, can I use it on a robot?
Sam: By the way, Liam, if you don't have this ability, I want to see this even more.
Liam: Oh, we're doing it.
Marisha: Just bluff your way through it.
Matt: No, because Imposter is the ability to mimic somebody else. It has nothing to do-- A disguise kit is what you're using.
Liam: And I've always had a disguise kit.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Because I did something back in the home game, I did something.
Matt: Yeah, you've done a couple of things. But it's not an ability you have.
Liam: No?
Matt: Well, you do have an ability, but it's only for you, it's not for Doty.
Taliesin: You own a cardboard box with a bunch of stuff.
Matt: So here's what we do. First and foremost, you have to go to the town and gather supplies because your disguise kit is designed for very small prosthetics and things. This is a large endeavor.
Liam: This is five times that.
Matt: Yeah. So I'm going to need you to roll an investigation check. This is your ability to go around the town and find, through the midst of chaos of Emon trying to repair itself, somebody who can sell you the supplies necessary.
Liam: Well, that is a 20.
Taliesin: I need some clay.
Matt: A natural 20?
Liam: No, not a natural 20.
Matt: But a 20? That's still fine. All right, it takes you--
Taliesin: I gave him a list.
Matt: It takes you about three hours, round trip, to go into the city, locate the location, and purchase-- relatively inexpensive, comparatively, about ten gold pieces for materials to do this. Which is expensive for anyone who's just-- and a lot of it is burlap material that's gone over with a weatherproofing liquid, that when it solidifies, it gives almost a rubbery texture. It's used for carts that are traveling a long distance under bad weather. And you figure that might resemble some sort of a skin-type texture at a distance. You gather other elements to build a mask, to wrap things in material, to block things that might look metallic. So yeah, so you gather things that might work in your favor. So as you collect this, what are you guys working on?
Sam: We're making a mask?
Taliesin: Well, the first thing that we're going to need, is we're going to need a way of connecting this to him without limiting his movement, so I'm making so it's a very accessible, easy harness to get this on and off. And starting to design and put together how we're going to-- what I'd like to make is a couple-- a porcelain cover for the hands and face so that it actually looks like perhaps-- it won't draw immediate suspicion, but if it does, it will look like somebody with an artificial limb, maybe they've been hurt.
Liam: Get me ten sets of scissors.
Matt: (laughs) So are you crafting the porcelain?
Taliesin: I am. I've got the kiln.
Matt: Yes, but your materials, you're used to using--
Taliesin: Instead of porcelain, I'm going for the ceramics that I use for some of my build. It's more practical. I've been working on some jewelry shit, I could genuinely learn how to do this.
Matt: This is true, but the skillset for jewelry is very different from the skillset of porcelain.
Liam: I need you to make a rig, like in a video game. Can you do that?
Laura: I'm going go into town and buy some plates for Laina.
Matt: Okay. I will say--
Taliesin: I'm willing to have this--
Sam: We could just use mud from outside.
Matt: Do you have a set of potter's tools? Because that would be specifically what would be used for this, if you're going to be working with ceramics and porcelain.
Taliesin: Can I roll to see? Because I have a kiln, so I might have it, but I don't know if I have it--
Matt: But you have a kiln that's designed more for-- it's more of a metal-use forge.
Taliesin: It's more of a metal-use forge.
Matt: So it'll destroy ceramics. It burns at a certain heat.
Travis: This could be the dumbest--
Marisha: This is the best thing we've ever wasted time on.
Matt: I'm so excited.
Taliesin: If prototype one fails, I'll make it out of pewter.
Matt: Okay. This is an adjacent skill set. You're not going to get your proficiency bonus to it, but you do have materials to essentially try it. I want you to go ahead and roll a base dexterity check. Just add your dexterity modifier. You're not proficient.
Taliesin: I'm trusting in Gil, because he also can't make a pot.
Travis: Say the thing, say the incantation!
Taliesin: Mecca lecca high, mecca hiney ho, don't fuck me, Gil.
Marisha: Where are those pottery tools, Gil?
Taliesin: And those pottery tools are--
Marisha: (laughs) It's a good roll.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. It takes you the better part of the next two hours, but you manage to create some--
Taliesin: Thank you for helping me Ghost, by the way. Never mind.
Matt: They have to cool and harden, but in the process of crafting it and heating it, you do have some decent ceramic plates that you think might work. They're going to be fragile.
Taliesin: That's fine.
Matt: Not like they'll crumble on their own walking, but, if they take any sort of chip and damage the ceramic.
Taliesin: Hands and face is what I was hoping for.
Matt: I'll say the better part of two hours or so to craft them, and then you begin to heat them in the kiln. It'll take you a while for them to harden and set.
Taliesin: Okay, and we're just figuring out a little easy armature that won't get in his way. And I'm peeking at him, seeing how he works--
Matt: All right. The armature, roll tinker's kit. Check. Proficiency plus dex.
Sam: I'm going to-- oh, sorry.
Taliesin: You can assist.
Matt: Actually, this would be proficiency plus intellect, is what it would be, because this is trying to figure it out specifically.
Taliesin: I'd be happy for an assist, unless you're doing something.
Sam: I was going upstairs to ask one of the help something.
Taliesin: Oh, go ahead, okay, that's fine. I'll just work on your robot by myself, then. 21.
Matt: Okay, easy enough to figure out a harness. What are you doing, Tary?
Sam: What was the servant's name who you said used to have short hair, now long?
Matt: Shayne.
Sam: I go to her? Him?
Matt: It's a her. She will punch you so hard.
Sam: I offer to buy her hair for 100 gold pieces to use as a wig.
Matt: How do you say this? (all laugh)
Matt: She's literally outside, sitting on the outside wall of the gate, leaning forward, just on a stool, with a loaded crossbow over her lap, looking out at the distance. And you're down below, about 20 feet down.
Sam: You there, excuse me. Hello?
Matt: She looks over the top. "Yeah?"
Sam: Hi! Taryon Darrington. New member of the group. Hi.
Matt: "Hi."
Sam: Yes, we're working on a very important project. It's an undercover mission in a foreign land, and we're going to need a disguise. Specifically, a wig, a convincing wig. We all thought that it might be a good idea to have some real hair for this wig, and, well, you have beautiful hair. I wouldn't mind if you would lend it to the cause. I'd like to buy your hair for 100 gold pieces. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and roll a persuasion check.
Liam: Oh my god, where's Shorthalt when you need him?
Laura: Did he roll well?
Taliesin: I'm not saying.
Sam: Persuasion? 24.
Matt: She goes, "You're kidding me, right?"
Sam: Oh, no, no, no. And I reach into my bag of holding and pull out 100 gold and say, it would mean a lot to me and to my teammates if you would cooperate in this mission. It might even save a life.
Matt: She gives you this long, stern, dark look. "(laughs) Make it 500 and you got a deal."
Sam: 500? All right, fine. (all laugh)
Sam: And a bargain at that.
Matt: "Ah, it was getting too long, anyway." She makes her way down the ladder and just walks past you into the keep. Comes back about half an hour later, head completely shaved smooth, and she's got, in a little square of fabric, a cluster of all of her red hair. She balls it up, comes over.
Sam: A pleasure doing business with you. This haircut might very well be the fate of the world, so thank you.
Matt: "You're welcome."
Sam: Here's your money.
Matt: "Thank you. Here's your fucking hair. God damn weirdo." And walks off and heads back to her perch at the top of the wall.
Sam: Buy my book! (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. You now have Shayne's hair--
Sam: I'm going to try and make a wig out of it.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Don't really know how.
Laura: It's just a bunch of pieces of hair.
Sam: Glue? I've got alchemy, right? I can make, like, goop?
Taliesin: You want a-- no, nope, I'm not helping. Never mind. Don't want to help.
Matt: You can. Do you want to do that?
Sam: Make some goop. Some glue to put on it.
Matt: We'll say, using the basis of a tanglefoot bag, which is a very simple alchemical--
Sam: Oh, it's got goo in it, yeah.
Travis: I mean, I can make a gallon of it.
Matt: You begin to apply it to the top of Doty's head, and begin to very carefully layer hair across it. I'm going to need-- let's see-- (laughs) I love you guys so much.
Laura: How long does goop last? Will Doty just always have hair now?
Sam: I mean, it's pretty sticky.
Laura: Gross.
Matt: Go ahead and make-- just make a dexterity check.
Sam: Okay. Okay. Ooh. Not good. I'm feeling lucky. 17.
Matt: 17. (laughs) So it looks a little Carrot Toppy, but it works. These clusters of poofy red hair, but you layer it in a way that looks as good as you can, given the fact that you glued hair to Doty's head. (all laugh)
Matt: It could've gone a lot worse. From a distance, this kind of looks like a person.
Sam: I also gave him a little bit of--
Matt: Little bit of goatee?
Sam: Just to match me.
Matt: Okay, yeah, great. You now have--
Travis: Do you mean the fu man, or did you give him the full goatee? Because you just did the fu manchu.
Sam: Probably just the fu man.
Matt: All right, there you go.
Laura: But it's going to be covered by a mask.
Sam: Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.
Matt: You've crafted your own avatar.
Liam: Is the hair curly or straight?
Matt: It's a little wavy.
Liam: Wavy, okay.
Matt: Her hair had been short before, when it grew out long, it came out a little wavy. So yeah, it has a little bit of a-- it looks like... What was the actor's name? From Mask?
All: Eric Stoltz?
Matt: Kind of looks like that on Doty.
Taliesin: Critical Role, ladies and gentlemen. Eric Stoltz. Google it.
Marisha: Cher was great in that.
Matt: It's a great movie.
Liam: I thought you were going to go Ronald McDonald, so that's a step up.
Matt: Yeah, see? But that's kind of the texture and the look of the hair, from what I recall it.
Sam: Okay, we've set the stage.
Laura: Wow.
Sam: Vax, bring us home.
Matt: So, with the porcelain cooling off, Vax comes back with the rest of the supplies. (all laugh)
Liam: Oh, good gods! What did you make, what did you do?
Sam: He's not just the president, he's a member, too! (all laugh)
Matt: What's fantastic, is he's glued the facial hair before the porcelain mask was put on, so as Percy and Vax come in with their pieces--
Taliesin: All right, I've got the-- Oh, good God!
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: I mean, it's bad. It's really bad.
Taliesin: No, it's-- I mean, like, it's--
Liam: It's a start. I think the hair will actually help the molding clay stay in place.
Taliesin: We're going to put a little wrap, it'll be fine.
Sam: And you've got hands?
Liam: (sighs)
Taliesin: Oh, yes, that too. Yes.
Sam: Ah, excellent. Excellent.
Liam: All right. We collectively are Dr. Frankenstein.
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: Oh my gosh.
Liam: Let's make this happen.
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: Okay. So, you put on the harness. You get the ceramic plates on that can loosely appear to be smoother, and a little more of a general curvature to the joints, so that it looks more natural from a distance. You put on the-- The mask of porcelain that you made, I mean, you know, the facial hair that's underneath and is on Doty's face is going to be under the mask.
Taliesin: Yes. Thank God.
Matt: You could attempt to remove it, if you'd like.
Liam: No, I think that'll help--
Taliesin: No, no.
Sam: No. We'll leave it.
Liam: -- it'll help hold all it in place.
Sam: Just a little glue to help stick it there.
Taliesin: In case we're in combat and it comes out, maybe we'll get, like, a momentary element of surprise as they go, 'My God, what is that?'
Matt: Plus it's just good to know that, at any given point in time, Doty now has a secret goatee. (all laugh)
Matt: That only you know about.
Sam: I had extra hair, I wanted to use it.
Taliesin: #secretgoatee. (all laugh)
Matt: #secretgoatee. (all laugh)
Marisha: #secretgoatee. (all laugh)
Taliesin: What is this episode? What--
Liam: Oh my God.
Marisha: This is the worst thing!
Matt: All right. Play 'em home, keyboard cat. Roll a disguise kit.
Liam: Oh, all right. I'm going to try to make this a--
Travis: (keyboard sounds)
Liam: What number do I use for the disguise kit? Dexterity?
Matt: No, this would be-- hold on, the toolkit here-- with you it would be-- Yeah, because it is--
Liam: Because I'm a rogue.
Matt: It's how nimble your fingers are. It's a dexterity bonus plus the proficiency modifier for a disguise kit. If you are proficient with this kit, with the disguise kit?
Liam: Oh, my gods.
Matt: What are your proficiencies?
Liam: I don't think so. I mean, I don't know, so I'm just going to say no.
Matt: Then it's just dexterity.
Liam: Dexterity.
Matt: Just roll a d20, add your dex bonus.
Liam: Okay. All right, I'm going to go for like, a General Krieg-type look to the face? I'm going to do my best--
Matt: Okay.
Liam: -- to redheaded General Krieg?
Laura: Nice.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Okay, here we go. I'm going to use Luck.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: I'm going to use Luck.
Matt: (laughs) Are you sure?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Are you sure?
Laura: Are you sure?
Liam: I'm quite sure. Natural 20!
Laura: Oh my God. (all cheer)
Liam: General Krieg, it's good to see ya!
Matt: In spite of the absurdity of what you've managed to accomplish with the better part of your day, as the sun is now setting, and the rest of you have been wondering what the fuck is going on down there, you manage to build some semblance of a muscular structure underneath the robes. And amongst the porcelain mask that Percy had set as a base, you have crafted texture, color, it looks kind of like a face.
Taliesin: It looks like Lincoln from Disneyland! (all laugh)
Matt: It does! It looks like a shitty animatronic. Which means--
Sam: I was the sixteenth president. (all laugh)
Matt: Like, it really does.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Like, not a good Disney animatronic. Like, state fair animatronic.
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Chuck E. Cheese.
Liam: Chuck E. Cheese.
Laura: Chuck E. Cheese.
Matt: Yeah. This has been through a few fires.
Marisha: Yeah, I was just going to say, been through a fire!
Travis: (animatronic sounds)
Matt: Yeah, it's Bonnie Springs. It's straight-up Bonnie Springs. But, given the circumstances, not too bad!
Taliesin: Boys, I'm so proud of both of you.
Liam: Guys, art is subjective, all right? Put clothes on top of this thing and we're golden, I think.
Laura: #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage. (all laugh)
Liam: Happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody!
Taliesin: I'm quite pleased. I'm quite pleased.
Sam: I didn't think that Doty could be improved, but you all impressed me today. Thank you. Thank you for this.
Taliesin: Good work, everybody.
Sam: Good work.
Taliesin: Good work, everybody.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Good teamwork.
Sam: Teamwork!
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Yes! Feels good to say it!
Liam: Well, good work.
Sam: Shall we go to Vasselheim?
Marisha: Yeah, let's go.
Taliesin: Grog?
Travis: And I'll come down.
Taliesin: Grog!
Laura: What have you been doing up there?
Travis: Is that General Krieg? (screams) (all laugh)
Taliesin: It's all right! It's all right!
Sam: No, no, no!
Taliesin: It's very expensive, don't break it.
Travis: Why have you aligned yourself with this creature?
Liam: I knock on the side of its head.
Sam: (hollow metal knocking sounds)
Liam: That's not Krieg.
Laura: It's Dootie.
Travis: No. Dootie did not have fire crotch hair. He did not have a face or hands--
Sam: Did you say 'fire crotch'?
Taliesin: Yes, he did.
Travis: --or a cloak. He didn't have any of that stuff.
Liam: Yeah, but Grog, we glued it on. We Dorked with it.
Travis: Oh, he's wearing a disguise! Yes.
Liam: Yes, he's a disguised robot.
Travis: Who did that?
Taliesin: Oh, all of us.
Travis: As a team?
Marisha: Mainly these three--
Liam: Mostly Keyleth.
Travis: Right.
Matt: It occurs to you guys, you don't know where the hair came from.
Liam: What?
Marisha: Druidcraft.
Travis: Wow.
Taliesin: Wow, well done.
Liam: Got all your hair--
Travis: Could you do that to me?
Taliesin: Where did you get the hair?
Liam: Where is the hair from?
Taliesin: What is it?
Sam: I've got some tricks up my sleeve. (laughs)
Liam: Did you pull it like a patch off and it turns into a bunch of hair?
Sam: Maybe. Maybe I did.
Liam: God, magic is amazing.
Laura: Did you get glue all over my robe that I put on him?
Sam: Maybe. Maybe I did.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Oh, motherfucker.
Liam: That'll do all right.
Laura: 24.
Matt: (singsong) That robe is ruined.
Laura: Oh no! It's not ruined!
Matt: (laughs) Certainly. Elements of it are permanently glued to Doty.
Marisha: Oh, I think this is your hair-dying robe now. Sorry.
Laura: That was my stealth robe.
Marisha: And now your--
Sam: And will be once more, I'll have it cleaned and pressed for you.
Liam: Wait there's glue on the--
Taliesin: That's the stealth robe?
Liam: -- on the elven cloak? Oh.
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: Does that mean that the--
Sam: It's a magical item you put on?
Laura: (laughs nervously) Yes.
Taliesin: You put a magical item on the robot?!
Laura: That's the only robe I fucking had!
Taliesin: (laughs)
Travis: Wow.
Liam: Oh, that--
Travis: For nothing.
Laura: (shouts) I didn't know you were going to glue it to him!
Liam: Much sentimental value--
Laura: (shouts) I know!
Taliesin: Now there's a robot with sentimental value.
Liam: It's all right, you're still alive. Whoop-dee-doo. Let's just do the thing, come on.
Marisha: You're right, now that I've blurred my vision, the glue is the most noticeable part.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: I think it blends into the texture, actually, quite nice. Makes it look like he's seen some shit.
Laura: Motherfucker! Let's go to Vasselheim.
Travis: Yeah, let's go.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'll buy you a new robe.
Matt: Doty's been standing there, and as soon as you guys say let's go and Doty starts moving, it has this scary Return to Oz feel to it--
Laura: Ew. I like it.
Taliesin: This is everything I've ever wanted.
Matt: (Doty walking sounds)
Liam: Oh, man.
Marisha: Hey, where did you learn contouring?
Liam: What--
Marisha: (laughs) Because that's really well done.
Liam: You've seen what I can do with hair, right? I mean, are you really surprised?
Marisha: Good point, let's go.
Matt: It's the elvish half.
Marisha: It's the elvish half.
Travis: It's the elvish half.
Liam: Clasp time, Clasp time.
Matt: Yeah. All right, so. You go ahead and head up to the Temple of Sarenrae within your keep, there is the central tree there. You go ahead and Transport via Plants to--
Matt: Vasselheim!
Marisha: Vasselheim!
Matt: Where in Vasselheim do you want to exit?
Marisha: And we have the book? We have the book in the chest? Chest and the book?
Taliesin: We have the book.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Not the chest, but in the bag of holding.
Taliesin: But we have the book. Yeah.
Laura: Wrapped in cloth.
Marisha: Where? Wasn't there the tree that was near the Slayer's Take?
Matt: There is one, yeah, there's one that patches there.
Marisha: Yeah. We'll do that.
Matt: Okay, so you use that one.
Liam: Let's use that save point.
Marisha: Yeah. What do they call it? Never mind.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Waypoint.
Marisha: There! Yes, thank you.
Travis: The waypoint.
Matt: So, as you guys emerge it is still early afternoon in Vasselheim. The sun is just setting in your location, you guys have travelled far northwest at this point when it was still midday. You emerge roughly in the center of the Quad Roads, a little bit north-center area of the Quad Roads. What are you looking for?
Laura: Well, we should go--
Taliesin: Library.
Laura: Yes, the library.
Liam: Library.
Laura: We delivered the horn of Orcus to the Platinum Dragon.
Matt: Yeah, the Platinum Sanctuary.
Laura: Yes. So we should probably go talk to them as well.
Marisha: Because I imagine they'd have a good hiding place?
Taliesin: It's where I'd put the Ark of the Covenant, certainly.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Laura: And also to talk to them about Orcus.
Marisha: Correct.
Laura: Since that's--
Marisha: And then shops for more potions.
Liam: Do we want to split up? You want to go talk Orcus?
Marisha: That's actually not a bad plan.
Laura: Yeah. Sure.
Marisha: Okay. You're going to go research Orcus?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: The twins?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: All right. Percy, you want to go to the Platinum Reserve?
Taliesin: Always.
Marisha: All right. We'll take the book. Tary? You want to come with us or the twins?
Sam: With you, absolutely.
Marisha: All right. Grog?
Travis: Ugh, god, the options both suck. (all laugh)
Travis: Fuck!
Taliesin: Go with the twins, they're more inclined to violence.
Laura: Oh, Grog could also go learn about the Nine Hells!
Travis: No, no no. Okay, wait. Books?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Nope. What are you doing?
Marisha: Books.
Travis: No. I'm doing my own thing.
Liam: We're gonna go learn about scary things, though.
Sam: I've been wanting to buy some potions and things, is that an option here?
Marisha: Oh, do you want to be team potions?
Taliesin: And buying things? You like buying things.
Marisha: Team Shopping, right Grog?
Laura: Tary-- Tary!
Matt: Grog's really good at buying potions.
Laura: Tary-- I pull Tary aside.
Sam: Yes, what?
Laura: If you're going to go shopping with Grog you need to know-- don't look at him. He is terrible with money.
Taliesin: I can't look away.
Laura: Tary, he's terrible with money. I mean like, he will offer them-- stop it! He will offer them double what they ask for.
Sam: Oh. And that's not good? Don't worry, I've been raised around money, I know its worth. I have--
Laura: I'm just saying--
Sam: -- at least six trust funds and they're all managed quite well.
Laura: (deadpan) I'm so happy for you.
Liam: Tru-- what?
Laura: Just keep an eye on him, all right?
Sam: I will receive your trust.
Laura: (sighs)
Sam: And I will fulfill your request as a fellow member of this team.
Laura: (strained) Fabulous.
Sam: Thank you for entrusting me with this mission.
Taliesin: Thank you, Tary, good luck. Grog, keep an eye on him, make sure that everything's--
Travis: Oh, I will.
Liam: As they leave, I spank Grog hard on the ass and say, money was meant to be spent!
Laura: (laughs)
Travis: I like that twin.
Matt: (laughs) All right, you scatter into three different directions. First--
Marisha: To the library?
Matt: All right.
Laura: No, you were going to the Platinum Sanctuary.
Travis: Yeah, Jesus. (laughs)
Laura: We're going to the library.
Marisha: Which is to the place where they--
Travis: Holy shit.
Taliesin: Archive.
Marisha: (shouts) To the archive!
Sam: Did you guys both say goodbye and then you're walking the same direction?
Matt: Yep! Yeah.
Travis: Oh, you're parked over here, too? Oh, okay, cool.
Taliesin: I'm tired-- okay, this is awkward now, we'll just keep--
Marisha: They're right next door, they're connected, they're partners.
Liam: Well some people go this way, and some people go that way and some people go both ways!
Matt: (laughs) All right, so you guys make your way up to the Platinum Sanctuary, you head to the base of the central mountain that the north end of Vasselheim is built around, to the winding stair that leads up to the Sanctuary proper. There, as you ascend, you can see the sun is getting to the three to four o'clock in the afternoon position. The color of the sky's starting to turn a bit different. You guys make your way to the outside doors of the Sanctuary, where you see the guards are there, stationed, and as you approach, some of them put up a bit of an aggressive front from a defensive standpoint, but one of them does recognise you and approaches, pulls the front of his helmet up. "You are Vox Machina."
Laura: We are.
Matt: "What business do you have here at the Platinum Sanctuary?"
Laura: We have come to discuss the (whispers) Horn of Orcus that we delivered here a while ago.
Matt: "So you request an audience with Scalebearer Vord?"
Laura: Mm-hm.
Liam: Yeah. That guy.
Travis: The sphinx's name.
Laura: What?
Travis: The sphinx's name.
Laura: I don't remember.
Matt: (laughs) All righty. Highbearer Vord. He says, "Very well. Please to be patient, I believe he is busy."
Laura: Oh. Right.
Matt: And he heads inside, the doors close behind.
Laura: As he does that, I look to Vax and go, hey, I have an idea. So the book we have, right?
Liam: Mm?
Laura: What if instead of leaving it here, we left it at the Raven Queen's sanctuary? Don't you think they would keep it more safe? Because she hates undead, right? This is like her nemesis, right?
Liam: She does. Yeah, I mean, that's a whole thing, I don't think that's a bad idea, but I feel like if I go there, I need to stay for a bit.
Laura: Oh, really?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Do you want to do that?
Liam: No, not yet.
Laura: All right, cool. Let's forget I mentioned anything.
Liam: Let's do that.
Laura: All right.
Matt: All right. About 15 minutes or so pass as you guys are led up. It's a gorgeous view from up here, by the way, I mean, for Vasselheim, the cloud cover is probably 70 to 80% of the year, with coming storms and sleet. This is one of the few days you've been during this part of the season where the sky is open. You actually see some blue in the sky, and as the light of the day begins to grow more towards a dusk color you start seeing the distant change and it's just endless thick, dense forest of the Vesper Timberland all around the city. And so there's kind of this serene waiting period as well.
Laura: I just lean against Trinket.
Matt: Trinket just (bear noises). You calm Trinket a bit. Trinket doesn't like heights and is up here on this platform, it's literally like a very small rail and then it drops probably a good 150, 200 feet down, and so Trinket's just like staying as far away from the edge as possible. Eventually the doors shift and one side opens up slightly, the same guard walks out. "All right, very well. Follow me." Turns around. Leads you in. He's carrying his large, very well-polished tower shield to his side, he still has his helmet visor up. Leads you into the central structure.
Laura: Do we know what we're going to say?
Liam: We're going to talk about the book. We're going to ask them if they can destroy it.
Laura: Or hold it, right? Do something with it.
Liam: Preferably destroy.
Laura: Okay. It's history, though.
Liam: It's dangerous.
Laura: True.
Matt: You guys are led to the audience chamber. Surrounded by the wide den of pillars and the central area has a hole above the top of the temple where the light comes through and there you see, stepping in hurriedly from the opposite side, flanked by two advisors is Highbearer Vord, the Silver Touched. You see his elven form is very fine-featured, his skin still very pale, almost pearlescent when the light hits it and his robes flow behind him, dragging a good four or five feet across the center. It's such an open space between the circular pillars that hold this-- it's just this tiny image of him approaching you amongst this wide-open space with his two advisors. As the footsteps get louder and louder as he approaches. "So yes, you've summoned me, what is your business?"
Laura: Didn't mean to summon you, Scalebearer, I know your time is precious.
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: We however came across, in fighting the Chroma Conclave and defeating them, this book which references Opash's search into necromancy. NecromANcy? NecrOmancy.
Sam: NecrOmancy.
Matt: NecrOmancy. Josh NecrOmancy?
Liam: NECromancy.
Laura: Necrome-- yes.
Travis: Necromé?
Laura: Necromé.
Liam: (laughs) Does that name mean anything to you?
Matt: "I have read of it, yes. I mean, it's a creature of lore. Opash was before the Divergence, even. If you indeed found a tome that once belonged to him, this is of much interest to us and our network of researchers."
Liam: Research?
Laura: Researchers.
Matt: "Well, yes."
Laura: It's an evil tome.
Matt: "I can only assume it is, you are right."
Liam: We came to Vasselheim to dispose of it. My sister has read it. Parts of it, and--
Laura: (whispers) All of it.
Liam: It's foul. It should not be allowed to exist.
Matt: "We can ensure that it falls into no hands beyond this temple. However, we do have to research the contents, you understand. The necessity of understanding the evils and darkness that are out there, that when they arise we can properly counter them."
Laura: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Yes, go for it.
Laura: (groans)
Travis: Turd burgers.
Laura: It's not terrible, but it ain't good, 14.
Matt: 14. He's hard to read in general, disposition and station, and his eyes are so white, like the iris is almost not visible. And he's stone-faced in his explanation but he's making sense, you know. If you have information on--
Laura: Necromancy.
Matt: On necromancy!
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Jif.
Matt: Or any devices that darker forces utilize, it better prepares you if you know what those entail.
Laura: Right.
Matt: And if there is any place that could withstand the corruption of such a book, it would be the strongest focus of the Platinum Dragon's divine power that exists on the planet.
Laura: Well, that's good.
Matt: So, you get the sense that Vord is not deceiving you.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: What happens after you research it?
Matt: "We seal it in the vaults below, same place we stored the horn."
Liam: Has that vault ever been disturbed in its entire history?
Matt: "It's been a long time and we've reinforced it. If I recall, last time you were here you encountered some of our defense yourselves."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "I think you'll know by memory that we are well fortified. So--"
Laura: Be warned, the book tried to claim me.
Matt: "Hmm. If you resisted it, I have no doubt our clerics can as well." He nods his head over to one of his advisors.
Travis: Shade.
Laura: I know, yeah.
Travis: Dark shade.
Matt: This young man with a very, very tight braid pulled to the back of the head that dangles about mid-back behind silver and white robes just approaches and puts his hands out to accept the tome.
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry, we weren't clear. We came to discuss it. We don't have it now.
Matt: Puts his hands aside and steps back. "Oh. Well. Return with the tome, should you see fit to leave it here."
Laura: Can I ask you, how much do you know of Orcus?
Matt: "I know enough."
Laura: I don't know much of anything, and it's important that we learn.
Matt: "Hmm." So, he nods to one of the other advisors who steps off for a moment. "Sit a moment. This is a conversation to have." And some of the guards come and bring a few chairs and set them behind you. "Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, resides in the depths of Thanatos, one of the varying realms of the Abyss. It is here that he snuffs the life from all creatures and brings them under his sway. He is an entity of ever-hungering need for power, and to take all life and break it so he can bring it under his control. Thankfully, as one of the betrayer gods, he was sealed away, and the Divine Gate was placed up to prevent his, and any other evil entities' entrance into our world. However, that does not prevent him from sending his minions, sending his powers, sending his influence out through the permeable, small gaps in this gate. So his influence remains."
Laura: He only has two horns, right?
Matt: "Oh! Four, once."
Laura: Four?
Matt: "Two that he maintains on himself to this day, and two that were severed, enchanted, and bequeathed into two of his, at the time, one of his champions."
Liam: And all these many months, you've been in possession of the horn you have?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: And you don't have another one down in that vault?
Matt: "We do not."
Liam: What have you learned of the one you do have?
Matt: "Well, this belonged to a great and terrible champion of Orcus. It was utilized in the Calamity, the war that came to the very gates of Vasselheim. This armored evil was destroyed and torn asunder, the horn scattered. We currently have some of our finest and brightest out in search of the other one, now that we know they have and can be recovered. Not to any avail yet, but we're doing our best."
Laura: If you hear any word of that horn, will you send word to us?
Matt: "Of course. And you do the same, please."
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "One was dangerous enough."
Liam: We need to discuss a few things, but we'll fetch the tome.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: Thank you so much for your time.
Matt: "I don't have much of it. If you have business to discuss with me personally, I would recommend doing it now. Otherwise, you'll be dealing with one of my advisors when you return."
Laura: Do you know much about the Nine Hells?
Matt: "That's a complicated subject. What do you need to know?"
Laura: I fear we have to travel there.
Matt: "Why, pray tell, do you intend to travel there?"
Laura: There is a rakshasa after my brother and our cleric friend, Pike. And, unfortunately, I fear he will return if we don't snuff him out at the source.
Liam: It's already made one attempt.
Matt: "Hmm."
Liam: It's only a matter of time.
Matt: "I've dealt with fiends. I've dealt with devils. I am not a specialist on the Hells, but there are a few places where you could possibly research this information. Majority of such research is found in the presence, or at least in the grasp of the Cobalt Soul. They do have one small temple here in the city, and they have one over in Tal'Dorei. Either one will have some semblance of research at their disposal. What I can tell you is, in asking about Orcus and the Abyss, those are demons, entities, savage, chaotic, in selfish, hard to read societies that twist, crumble and rebuild, a rate that only insanity can seem to drive. Madness and hunger drives the Abyss. But the Hells, the Hells are built on tyranny. They are built on societies, power structures, subservience and dominance. Whereas few mortals dare tread in the Abyss, there have been some from many different realms, who go to the Hells to do business."
Laura: Do you know what sort of people might survive there?
Liam: Or fit in?
Matt: "Powerful ones. Ones that stay out of sight. Ones that don't make a scene. Just know; they're very clever, and above all else, they seek your soul."
Laura: All right.
Liam: No big.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Thank you for your time.
Laura: So, we'll go to the Cobalt Reserve.
Matt: "All right. One of my advisors will receive the tome upon its delivery."
Laura: Fabulous. Thank you.
Matt: "Good luck."
Laura: (whistles)
Matt: He stands up and as soon as you begin to stand up, the seats are already immediately pulled out from behind you. The guards separate them, he leaves with his advisors and you guys are led out of the temple back onto the winding staircase and into the heart of Vasselheim.
Liam: I pull Vex into an alleyway. (sighs) I don't know what the right thing to do is. I thought one thing going in there.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Liam: And now I think maybe you were right. I have not wanted to go to that temple, though. She has finally been speaking to me again.
Laura: All right. What about?
Liam: When I died, I saw her. I have dreamed of her already. And she speaks of some sort of purpose on the horizon. And I don't know if she's talking about your promise you made, or what. But she is with us. And I barely know what the fuck I'm doing, but I know that she doesn't want that book to exist. And, honestly, I am frightened of going to that temple because I want time. I want time with you, I want time with Keyleth, I want time.
Laura: All right.
Liam: And I don't want to lose that time now, I want to be selfish for a little while. We've been working so fucking hard, by all rights we should be dead.
Laura: Do you think if you go to the Raven Queen's temple, she'll claim you for her own right now?
Liam: Well, I don't know. I don't know. And look at this. And I start to unbuckle the front of my chest-- Relax, look at this.
Laura: What am I seeing? (laughs)
Matt: You see right around his heart there's a dark spot in the skin where some dark veins travel for about an inch or two across.
Laura: What the fuck is this?
Liam: I don't know.
Laura: When did it happen?
Liam: I don't know.
Laura: What do you mean, you don't know? Did it happen after you died?
Liam: I think so. Hurts a little bit.
Laura: What the fuck? We have to get you to a cleric, that's not normal!
Liam: Not really, no. I cover it back up.
Laura: Are you sure it's related to her?
Liam: But I think you are right, and I think that they're going to hold that, and someone will take it, whether it's in a hundred years or a thousand years, and she doesn't want it and--
Laura: Well, they're holding the Horn of Orcus. Playing devil's advocate.
Liam: Yeah, they already have that. They don't have this.
Laura: Then let's go to the Raven Queen's temple.
Liam: All right.
Laura: Do you want to go now?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Let's go.
Matt: Okay, while you guys make your way to the Raven's Eyrie, we go to you two. You guys are currently looking for a library. Who wants to make the investigation check to ask for information?
Taliesin: I'll do it, that's funny.
Laura: Would I have known anything about what that thing was?
Matt: Not really. It doesn't look diseased. It looks bruised almost. It's just a strange-looking bruise where you can see some of the veins are dark and visible, almost like varicose near the surface.
Laura: Like trauma?
Matt: Kind of, yeah, but it doesn't look--
Laura: It doesn't look like Raishan's?
Matt: No, it's not like that.
Marisha: So, we have the book. They went to the sanctuary. We are going to the library.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Okay!
Matt: As far as I know, that's what you guys are searching for.
Laura: Wait, I thought we had the book.
Taliesin: It's in the-- wait, no, the book's in the bag.
Travis: And I'm the one with the low intelligence.
Matt: (singsong) Grog has the book.
Marisha: You guys, I thought our whole thing was that we were taking the book to the sanctuary and then you guys were like, we're going to the sanctuary, because you guys totally gave me shit when I was like, the library, and you were like, not the library, but apparently we are.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: All right. Let's go to the library.
Taliesin: I rolled a 16.
Matt: It's like Vox Machina has a hard time planning. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Don't agree with him.
Matt: It's crazy.
Taliesin: That's not fair.
Sam: I'm the new guy. (all laugh)
Travis: "I'm the new guy."
Taliesin: 16, investigation.
Marisha: We said we had the book.
Taliesin: We thought we did, we were not paying attention.
Matt: Did you say you took the book?
Marisha: I thought we took the book, that was our whole fucking plan--
Taliesin: I thought we took the book too.
Marisha: -- that we took the damn book.
Taliesin: It occurs to me it was actually in the bag that Grog was holding.
Marisha: But I would assume if we said, "we're taking the book", that would mean--
Matt: If you guys said you're taking the book; Grog, you heard them take the book?
Travis: I thought you said you were taking the book to go look at the wherever.
Marisha: We have the book.
Matt: All right. I'll take that as consensus to say that you guys have the book.
Sam: Oh, I used the book to make the wig. Is that okay? (all laugh)
Sam: It's just, it's all paper.
Laura: It's glued under the cloak.
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: Papier-mâché of evil.
Matt: Okay. You guys, not having a bag of holding, are clutching the tome-- it's a big tome, it's like--
Marisha: I thought we put it in a box, right?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: No, we didn't have a box.
Laura: There was no box. It was a book wrapped in cloth in the bag of holding.
Sam: In a box.
Marisha: We wrapped it in cloth.
Matt: So there you go. You have a tome wrapped in cloth under your arm. You guys spend about an hour or so asking around. The locals, they're-- not saying they're not friendly, but not all of them are well-versed in what you're asking. You say library, some of them are more simpler folk are like, "I don't--" and eventually somebody says, "Oh yeah, you can head over to the-- what's it called? The Cobalt Vault. It's in the southern region of the Quad Roads."
Taliesin: That's exactly what I was looking for, thank you so much.
Matt: "All right, yeah, I'll show you." And the guy gives you a couple directions down the road, and you make your way there, and it's similar to the Cobalt Reserve in Westruun, but it's about a quarter of the size.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: The Cobalt Reserve is the center of the Cobalt Soul monk order, the Ioun worshipers that gather information and maintain it. As Ioun's presence was shattered slightly during the Calamity, in the battle against the chained god, her presence in Vasselheim was diminished and then regrew through the Cobalt Soul in Westruun, so it's expanding back into Vasselheim. You make your way to the structure. The exterior of it is this light-grey stone, it's a cylindrical building with three different doorways around the outside and a giant, bright blue and black marbled dome on top. It looks somewhat transparent, like it's made of a glass-type material. As you step into the front, you can see a central chamber within the inside that's also cylindrical, so you have a small walk-around hallway on the immediate inside of this giant structure, and then the actual library is in the interior, and so on the outside, you see a few books and there are some paintings and tapestries on the walls and you see a few varying monks walking around, a handful that are curious and turn as you walk in. They're all wearing the uniform, dark grey and blue robes of the Cobalt Soul, and there is a desk at the front, where you have a young woman of olive skin sitting, her hair short and wavy with very thick spectacles adorning the front of her nose. Young-ish, maybe mid-twenties. She looks up as soon as you guys approach. "Good day. I fear we're still in the process of preparing the interior, but what do you require?"
Taliesin: We were hoping for access to some of the deep research archives. We've been looking around, we have several complicated matters that we need to research, and we heard that you had a wonderful collection and we were hoping to gain access to some materials, preferably of the histories of Orcus, the Nine Hells, a few various things.
Matt: "I'm terribly sorry, that type of research is only for Cobalt Soul members."
Taliesin: Who could we talk to about special access? I'm sure that there must be somebody in charge.
Matt: "I apologize, I am--"
Marisha: I'm sorry--
Matt: "I'm going to have--"
Marisha: I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari and this is Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.
Taliesin: Close enough.
Marisha: We're a part of the group Vox Machina, we've been through here before, we're part of the Slayer's Take. This is a matter of great importance, so if there is any type of upper management we could talk to-- (all laugh)
Matt: Roll a persuasion check.
Travis: Fuck this. It's just that dismount at the end.
Taliesin: (creepy voice) Who wants to talk to the librarian?
Matt: It's Keyleth's specialty.
Liam: It was going great.
Marisha: (coughs) Mm, 11.
Matt: "I mean no offense, but I don't think we have the kind of research that you're looking for that we could--"
Taliesin: We would also possibly like to make a donation. And I pull out the Manual of Quickness of Action, place it upon the table.
Matt: She adjusts her glasses for a second and reaches into the desk and pulls out a small, white gem and passes it over, and as she does, you can see the front of the tome seems to glow almost like a blacklight over something that was reactive to it.
Sam: Covered in semen.
Matt: As soon as I said it, I was waiting for Sam on that one.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Taliesin: Thank you for ruining that one for me for all time.
Matt: Scans over. "Perhaps. Give me just a moment, please." And she slides the book in your direction, gets up and exits through one of the small doors in the side, that you didn't notice until now. It's part of a similar stone, just gives way and then closes behind her.
Taliesin: Well, we'll see what happens now.
Marisha: And yet, worst case scenario, I also have this book that Scanlan read that's on how to be a good leader--
Taliesin: Hold on to that one.
Marisha: All right, I'll hold on to it.
Matt: The door opens again and she comes back out, followed by a man of very, very dark skin, bright, soft eyes that crack on the sides from, you can gather, a lot of smiling. He wears the same uniform, blue and gray robes, but as he walks, you can hear what sounds almost like a faint-- almost like jewelry clanging, but you don't see any jewelry on him, and as he approaches, his arms are folded into themselves, and he steps forward quietly, looks at the book for a second, looks up at the two of you, and smiles, "Hello. My name is Kusuo and I am in charge of looking over this extension of the Cobalt Reserve's reach and collection. You have come to offer this book as trade?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "And you are seeking what?"
Taliesin: Well, we are in a bit of a bind. We are members of a traveling group of adventurers known as Vox Machina. We recently helped defeat the Chroma Conclave.
Matt: "I'm familiar with your exploits as of late, yes. It is our job to collect information and history and record of it, so I am very aware."
Taliesin: Well, the deeds and those things that must be done have not yet been fulfilled. We have just a few last, treacherous events that we must complete before the Chroma Conclave is completely put to rest. One of which has to do with Orcus, and the other with the Nine Hells.
Marisha: It's a rakshasa.
Taliesin: And we are desperate for knowledge that may keep us safe in our travels. Prepare us for our enemies.
Matt: "Come with me." And he takes the book and sweeps it up, and it vanishes into his robe.
Taliesin: Worth it!
Matt: He leads you into the small doorway that you watched open and shut before, and on the inside, you go from this barren outer walkway, into this large cylindrical library that is from floor to ceiling about 60 feet tall, with dozens of ladders that move around, and you can see books are in the process of being put up, some books are being categorized, it looks like there were stacks that have just arrived that are in the process of being researched and copied, there are a number of these monks that are at different tables in the process of making copies of books, this is specifically a repository for the gathering and guarding of information. In the center of the chamber, there is a spiral staircase that leads to an upper platform that has another series of chairs, either a research or reading section, and there are only a handful of people on the interior that are not dressed in the same way that these monks are, but each one of them is attended by a monk. And you--
Marisha: Anyone look familiar? Any uniforms that look recognizable?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: Yeah, use that one. That's weird.
Marisha: It's on another dice? All right.
Taliesin: There, that's better.
Marisha: Oh, that's good!
Taliesin: What is that? Oh--
Marisha: That's a 19! Perception?
Matt: Perception.
Marisha: 21. Sorry, 20. Yeah, 21.
Matt: Okay, so you glance around--
Marisha: No! 31!
Matt: There we go! I was like, your wisdom's pretty high--
Marisha: 31.
Matt: Okay. You look around really fast, glance at each person that is not of the Cobalt Reserve's attire, no one you recognize. But they all appear to be fairly affluent. And they're all in the process of reading through some sort of thick book with a stack next to them, of varying sizes, and the monk is just standing there patiently, watching them as they do so.
Taliesin: That's disconcerting.
Matt: And you recall, from your first time at the Cobalt Reserve, that no books can be taken from the Reserve. They can be read within the interior, they can be copied, notes can be taken. But you cannot remove them, and the monk that is assigned to you is both a guide, and to make sure you don't take anything you're not supposed to.
Marisha: Right. Theft protection.
Matt: Yes. And it seems that Kusuo has taken upon himself to be your assigned monk.
Taliesin: There's quite a bustle today, this is impressive.
Matt: "It is more than we are used to, usually. But we are happy to know that people are interested in knowledge. Any given day."
Marisha: Any reason for the sudden spark in interest?
Matt: "Well, recent events of dragons terrorizing countrysides, leads people to want to defend themselves and learn of these occasional terrors."
Marisha: Good on them.
Matt: "Anyway, follow me." And he leads you to the back of the spiral staircase, as it comes and meets with the floor, there is a large rug that sits as part of the decor there, and he glances around, and using his foot, his toe clips the edge of it and flicks up and catches the rug, folds it and sets it down, in one swift motion you weren't expecting, and with the dust that sets off, you now see what looks to be a trap door of the same material as the hardwood floor of the library. The small chain that he then bends down carefully, tugs and lifts, and you see the staircase that descends below.
Marisha: Can you do that with your toes?
Taliesin: Not with my toes, no.
Liam: That's some Name of the Rose shit right there.
Matt: "The books you require, we keep in the cellar. So, please, after you." It's a staircase. (all laughs)
Taliesin: No! I'm committed!
Matt: (laughs) You're just going down--
Liam: Then an escalator!
Matt: You're dog paddling your way through the darkness. You guys descend and the trap door closes behind you and it is pitch black. You have no vision, you can see in the vicinity, the stairs go down maybe 20 feet, however as soon as the trap door closes, a soft glow emanates from behind you and you can see there is some sort of a dangling wristband with a small glass marble that hangs at the end that is now glowing with a soft candlelight, and Kusuo is holding his arm in front of him as it dangles like a candle, and he slowly brushes past you and leads the way down before the stairs stop and level off into an open chamber, a square room, the cellar as he called it. There, inside, you see candelabras flickering in the corners, there's four of them, two near you and two on the far side. Within the shadowed, subterranean chamber, you see shelves and locked cases throughout. Some cases are glass, some are almost crate-like, but they have locks on the sides, and on these shelves it isn't books stacked to each end, each book is facing forward, and seems to be placed deliberately, and some of them are chained in, some of them have chains that dangle from the piece-- this is where all the secret books are kept. This is the private collection.
Taliesin: Books that want to get out.
Matt: As soon you guys enter the space, two monks of the Cobalt Soul spin out of the corners and immediately stand in the defensive position with their arms out in front of them, and then as soon as they see Kusuo smiles and nods, they put their guard down, arms together, and they bow for Kusuo. Kusuo turns back over the shoulder, "Do not worry, this is Wailen and Sura, they are assigned to watch over. So, stand aside, help our guests." He walks forward and leads you through some of these cases, and you look and they're made of different woods, some of them seem to have been brought from different locations, and there are scroll cases, there are giant wads of ancient parchment that are clustered together and bound with some sort of a leather strip, you can see tomes all across the way of different fronts and sizes, and some of them are very old and ruined. And in the back right corner of this chamber, you see Kusuo pulls what you didn't notice before, and that jangling sound you were hearing before is a giant ring of over a hundred keys that he pulls off of his neck. He turns it and begins just thumbing through the keys, very quickly, like he knows exactly what he's doing. Catches one key, looks at it, and walks over to one of the cases in that corner of the room and just undoes the locks, but they're a different key for each lock, and he goes and finds each one. First try, knows exactly where they go. As each lock is taken, he opens the case and on the inside you smell this scent of dust and ash, and there are four books in there, two of which look damaged, but they all look very old, and he reaches in and grabs two of them. One of them is one of the damaged ones, one of them is not. "You seek information on Orcus?" Sets one tome down on one of the nearby closed cases. "And the Nine Hells." Places the other next to it.
Taliesin: I just try and see if I can discern what the other two books are just from looking in and being a nerd.
Matt: They don't have any labelling on the cover.
Taliesin: Oh, nothing. All right. Fascinating. Thank you. I suppose we'll sit, and get to it.
Matt: "Very well."
Taliesin: And I sit down and I open the book.
Marisha: Yes. Which one are you opening?
Taliesin: Before I touch it, this doesn't react poorly to people handling it, does it? There's no--
Matt: He arcs an eyebrow towards you. "No, part of our distinct training is to disable any sort of wards should you wish to research."
Taliesin: Excellent.
Marisha: Which one are you opening, Percy?
Taliesin: I open the first one just to look into--
Marisha: The Orcus one?
Matt: Do you speak Abyssal?
Taliesin: I do not speak Abyssal.
Matt: The Orcus tome you aren't able to read. It is all in Abyssal.
Taliesin: Do you speak Abyssal? And the other book--
Matt: The other book?
Taliesin: -- I open up the Nine Hells, take a look.
Matt: That one is actually written in Common.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Weird question.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Abyssal.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I know creatures who are from the Abyss, right? I've encountered them?
Matt: You have encountered demons in your past, yes.
Marisha: If I do a Shapechange into a demon, can I then read Abyssal?
Matt: Lemme look at the spell real fast.
Sam: You're going to change into a pit fiend in the library?
Marisha: I would let him know! I would give him like a disclaimer.
Taliesin: I'm going to show you a really weird birthmark, don't panic.
Laura: I mean, if he really was a demon, why would he need to do research?
Taliesin: Who is my father?! I don't know.
Laura: Genealogy of the Nine Hells!
Matt: It does not specify, but it says you gain the abilities.
Liam: I think I've read it says you keep the same intellect, though, right?
Matt: Yeah, you keep the same intellect.
Marisha: You keep the same mental stats.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: But you get the abilities--
Matt: Yeah, you retain all your skills and saving throw and proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.
Marisha: In addition.
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: I don't know.
Sam: Might as well try!
Taliesin: I'm going to take a moment also before this happens, open the Common book, take a moment, and gently ask the good sir if they have a reading glass around, because I still don't have any reading glasses.
Matt: (laughs) He gives a curious look. "But of course." And he snaps his fingers, and the other monks, he just darts off for a second and then returns a moment later with a small wooden case that opens up, and on the inside there are four different types and thickness of reading glass you can go through. You find one that'll work okay.
Taliesin: Perfect. I'm going to let you deal with this other end of things, because I'm going to sit and read.
Marisha: What was that demon guy we encountered? Does he have a name?
Taliesin: Phil.
Sam: You mean the pit fiend, or--?
Laura: Oh, you mean like Senokir?
Liam: No, he was a genasii.
Marisha: The pit fiend was a devil. Who was the guy who lied to us, and you said devil at one point, and he was actually a demon.
Laura: You said he was a demon and he was actually a devil.
Matt: That was a glabrezu. That was what killed Pike.
Taliesin: What about the basement way back when?
Travis: Where we found you?
Taliesin: Yeah, remember?
Laura: The succubus?
Matt: That was after you found Percy. This was in the palace of Emon.
Laura: What about the succubus?
Liam: The succubus. And that thing with the bones.
Marisha: Succubus are-- yeah.
Laura: We did kill a succubus.
Matt: You did, yeah.
Liam: In Krieg's house.
Marisha: And they're demons, right?
Matt: They are fiends. You're not sure. You don't have enough knowledge-- Are you trained in religion?
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: But you could ask me. Well, I'm not--
Matt: Yeah. You're not too familiar. Part of this research is learning the distinguishing factors between fiends. You don't have a whole lot of knowledge of that.
Marisha: Okay. You know what? You're reading the book on the Nine Hells. That'll tell us what fiends there are.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: Right?
Matt: Maybe.
Taliesin: Maybe. I'm reading the book.
Marisha: Read the book.
Matt: Okay. There we go. (all laugh)
Liam: Saviors of the universe, we are.
Matt: So.
Taliesin: Do you know the dewey decimal system?
Marisha: Yes. (laughs)
Matt: What're you trying to find? Do you want to just read all the information? It'll take you--
Taliesin: I'm skipping specifically through Orcus, and also since she mentions what she's--
Matt: There's no Orcus in this book. This is about the Nine Hells.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm so sorry. Hierarchies. I'm trying to get a general overlay of some of the information if there's a natural enemy for the rakshasas. Any weaknesses, where we can find them.
Matt: Okay. You do know there is a very strong infernal hierarchy of all the hells.
Taliesin: I'm also seeing what the book also specializes in.
Matt: Yes, that's what it looks like as he's reading. It's a very rigid power structure here. And the whole purpose of most devils is to try and gain power and ascend their rank by proving themselves stronger or tearing others down to take their position.
Taliesin: So anyone lower would be an enemy, anyone higher would probably--
Matt: Well, they'll work together because it is a lawful evil society. It is a society that only functions because of its structure. So it is tyrant and underlings. And underlings will work and serve things they hate that are more powerful in hope of gaining the favor, especially since higher devils can bequeath lower devils the chance to ascend to a higher tier.
Taliesin: Are there stories of anybody defeating a rakshasa before?
Matt: You glance through, and rakshasas, like any other devil, can be killed. If you can go to it and kill it. But there are many tiers here. There are archdevils at the top. That are the rulers of each-- essentially the top ranks. There are greater devils below them. Greater devils include horned devils, erinyes, which you've encountered, pit fiends, which you've encountered, and ice devils. And they are the greatest of the devils below the archdevils. Then you have lesser devils, which are like imps, spine devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, chain devils, bone devils. You've got all these names, you get some drawings and sketches of some of these creatures, and they all look awful. Lowest in this rank are lemures. Lemures are the souls of people that have passed, who have either done enough evil deeds that they fall under the sway of one of the archdevils. Most of them are acquired by making a deal with a devil. A contract. They're big into contracts. Their power structure is based on what sort of souls, what power they can gain, what people they can sway, what people they can convince to--
Taliesin: Lemures are infernal Pokemon, is basically what you're getting to.
Matt: Yeah. Once a soul has come under the sway of a devil and is brought to the Nine Hells, it either can become just a lost wandering soul used as a source of energy; most of them convert into lemures which are the low-level slaves. They're ever-tortured, flesh masses that--
Taliesin: So like The Scream?
Matt: Yeah. They're the tortured souls of the Nine Hells. If a lemure does manage to do good enough work over an extended period of time it can ascend into a lesser devil, by pleasing its masters, by whatever it may be. There is a chance, that's how devils ascending are brought to a higher station.
Taliesin: There's a few that have crawled their way up.
Matt: Yeah, and the pit fiend you killed probably returned and got demoted.
Laura: Ooh, to a lesser? Like they get turned into something smaller?
Matt: If something really powerful and cool that was given a station was suddenly walking through the street and killed by a bunch of people in the city and came back and was like, "they killed me," they'd be like, "you're weak obviously". Reading the structure, you probably really ruined that guy's day. (laughs)
Taliesin: He's probably going to have centuries getting his shit back together. He's probably really pissed.
Matt: Yeah, you basically made him lose his house, and his dog, and his wife. You turned him into a country song.
Taliesin: Do they talk about anything like the children that we saved? The effect of angelic, angelic, why those little angel children--
Matt: There is very little talk about celestial blood, divas, other than the fact that there's been a long-standing battle since the founding. Since the prime gods and betrayer gods divided early in the creation of Exandria and--
Taliesin: There's no talk about using celestial power as some sort of weapon against these creatures.
Matt: Not celestial power necessarily, but some of the entities are susceptible to various divine magics and abilities, and that is a strong back and forth between the two sides. The big war is between the devils and the demons. The Abyss, which is the nature of chaos and evil and driven hunger at whatever cost, versus the power-hungry devils, which build structure, dominance, expanding their territory, and ruling through structure and power.
Taliesin: Okay, so within evil, there is chaos versus order is kind of the internal conflict of evil.
Matt: Yes, those are the two sides, devils versus demons.
Taliesin: All right. This is all very useful.
Matt: But there are many tiers of the hells and nine--
Marisha: Does it mention any Abyssal fiends that they particularly hate that we might have encountered?
Taliesin: Flipping. I'm just going to keep skimming.
Liam: While he's skimming could we jump back for just thirty seconds?
Matt: Sure.
Taliesin: Actually I'm happy to time-pass and we'll revamp that.
Matt: I just want to make sure that we don't get lost on this somewhere.
Liam: Just 30 seconds before we go in, I'm like I should have the book. I'll carry the book in, give me the book.
Laura: I thought you took the book.
Liam: I don't carry books.
Laura: No, you have the book. I thought you were lying to the guy. You actually have the book, right?
Liam: You took the book when we left--
Laura: I didn't take the book, I thought you took the book.
Liam: Are you fucking kidding me?
Laura: Are you fucking serious?
Liam: Fuck.
Taliesin: Can we direct people to the Benny Hill steampunk theme song.
Marisha: (sings Yakety Sax)
Laura: Let's go to the library.
Matt: All right, meanwhile.
Marisha: So were we supposed to take the book? Or were they supposed to take the book?
Taliesin: I thought you said that we were taking the book.
Marisha: Well, I also thought we were going to the Reserve and now we're in the library.
Matt: Are you unveiling the book?
Taliesin: No, we are not. We have it, we have not unveiled it.
Laura: We're heading to the library.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to keep reading while they head, you guys if you want to--
Marisha: I'm so confused on our plan.
Matt: There are many things you learn. One, the first layer of Avernus, which is the first layer of the hell. It is a terrible blackened rocky wasteland, rivers of blood. It's a bad place. Usually, you have to travel from each layer into the next one. There are very few portals that'll lead to the Hells. Usually, any that do start at Inverness and you have to work your way in. That area is ruled by Zariel, which is the Archduchess of Avernus. This is also the realm of Tiamat.
Taliesin: Ah, yeah, okay!
Matt: You glancing through and trying to find things that catch your attention. This is a large tome. You could spend days and days researching this but you don't have a lot of time. You are looking for specific things. Dis is the second layer of the Nine Hells. It is a labyrinth of canyons, wedged between sheer mountains, filled with iron ore. There are iron roads that span through the canyons with a series of bridges that lead over these giant crevasses and this dark landscape. The ruler of the second layer and the lord currently is Dispater.
Travis: Dispater?
Matt: Yes. Dispater, which is--
Laura: Similar to James Spader.
Liam: Yeah. (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah. Just half-cousin. Talks kind of like him, too, it's really creepy.
Marisha: So, it's the realm of Dis and the leader is--
Taliesin: Dispater.
Marisha: Dispater.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: They're not that clever.
Marisha: And the first layer of Hell is also referred to as the layer of Inyimenemo-- what?
Matt: Avernus.
Marisha: Avernus.
Matt: However, what does catch your attention immediately is on Dis there is a city called the Iron City of Dis that is a massive metropolis, primarily where most extra-planar entities travel to do business. It is in many cases an open market.
Taliesin: So, probably safer.
Matt: It's one of the safer areas for a mortal to walk through, comparatively-- it's still in one of the Hells. But because it is such a center for business, it's a popular location for extra-planar travelers, it's a popular place for succubi, incubi to travel, it's a popular place for rakshasas. It specifically brings up hags, creatures that deal in business, deal in exchanges, deal in contracts. Beyond the usual devil ones, a lot of them tend to go to the Iron City of Dis.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm marking that-- I'm putting a pin on my Pinterest board.
Marisha: Atlas Obscura that shit.
Taliesin: Atlas Obscura the hell out of the City of Dis.
Matt: I can give you the rest of this to read on the break, if you'd like because it's a lot of information, but that's the one that sticks out to you.
Taliesin: I don't want to kill Travis.
Matt: No. In looking specifically for the mention of rakshasas, there are sections about the creatures and talking about their history and how they originally stemmed from the Hells and burst out of the prime plane. It goes into their history there, the rest of it doesn't have as much in correlation to where you would look for such a creature. They do exist on multiple layers of the Hells.
Taliesin: City of Dis seems to be the winner.
Matt: At the very least, a place where you can get information that can lead you elsewhere.
Taliesin: I'm very excited.
Marisha: Any information on how to get there?
Laura: (sing) We built Dis city on--
Liam: (sing) We built Dis city on--
Taliesin: Inter-planar travel.
Marisha: I can Plane Shift there. I do a very detailed look at what the Iron City of Dis seems like--
Taliesin: I'll sketch a little bit of it out of the book, as well.
Matt: Okay, cool. And there are some descriptors in there, some mild sketches. One thing it does speak of is the Tower. The Iron Tower of Dispater which is, essentially, this massive central structure to the city where the actual archdevil himself looks down upon the city and keeps watch over most business that he can.
Liam: Great stealth roll.
Matt: Good job, thank you. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Dagger, dagger.
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: While you guys are completing your research-- Taryon and Grog! What are you guys doing?
Sam: Do you have the book? (all laugh)
Travis: Which book?
Sam: Never mind. Let's go find a place to buy some potions.
Travis: All right. Are you accustomed to buying things?
Sam: Very much so.
Travis: Oh. Do you have a personal shopper?
Sam: I actually do, yes.
Travis: Nice. Well, show me how it's done.
Sam: All right, I'll take you under my wing, so to speak.
Travis: Yeah, I'm a bit big so I don't know how you're going to do that.
Sam: Doty, join us!
Matt: And as you guys walk through the streets, everyone stares. Partially because you are a bright shiny beacon of finely polished gems and armor flanked by a massive bearded goliath and whatever the fuck Doty is.
Sam: Hello, hi, greetings, good day, good afternoon, don't mind them, they're my friends! Hahahaha!
Travis: Wow.
Matt: About five minutes of walking before two armored Bastions come up in their piecemeal leather and scale breastplate armor with their heavy fur cloaks over their shoulders, holding spears. "You!"
Sam: Uh!
Matt: "You walk with strange company. What's your business here in Vasselheim?"
Sam: We are wandering merchants, trying to find some textiles to buy to resell in other lands. That's all. Don't mind my traveling companions. They're my protectors. I travel as a merchant with a lot of coin, so I found these two at a leper colony and nursed them back to health. It was also a gym, a muscle-man place, so they're really buff. But they're also lepers. And that explains their matted hair.
Matt: Make a deception check, please.
Taliesin: You get to experience this as a normal person now. I'm so excited.
Sam: What, deception?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Ooh, I better use Luck. Ooh, no, that's worse. (all laugh)
Sam: So do I use the higher one, or just the second one?
Matt: I'll double check.
Laura: I think you have to use the second roll.
Sam: Well, it don't matter.
Matt: You choose.
Sam: Okay, ten.
Matt: Total of ten.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: He leans in real fast. "Oh wow, that's got to be unfortunate. Being so buff and so filled with leprosy."
Sam: It is their cross to bear. That's why this one doesn't even talk, and this one is a leper of few words.
Matt: He leans back, and the two guards watch you and nod and step back to let you continue to pass.
Sam: Thank you. Might I inquire from you fine gentleman where we might find some medicine or healing potions? These lepers are set to relapse. That way? All right. I'll head that way then. Good day to you. Keep warm.
Matt: As you guys keep walking, they slowly close behind you and just begin to follow from about 30 feet back.
Travis: That was amazing. Have you ever lied to anybody before?
Sam: Never. I think I have a talent for it though. I just felt the words coming out and I went with it.
Travis: It was a thrill, right?
Sam: It was thrilling. It was exciting. And they were going with it. They were eating it up. I had them right where I wanted them. I could've told them fucking anything. It was great, right?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Travis: On a scale from one to two, how do you think it went?
Sam: I mean, two's the higher of the two, right? Oh, you don't know. (all laugh)
Sam: I feel good.
Travis: Nice, yeah.
Sam: Now, remember, if anyone asks you, just go (moans in pain) "I'm a leper", or something like that.
Travis: (moans in pain) I'm a leper.
Sam: That's good.
Travis: Yeah, good. Are they following us now?
Sam: Oh, I hadn't looked.
Matt: You turn around, right at them, and 30 feet back they're walking and they just stop as you stop.
Travis: Still think it went well?
Sam: (whispers) I think they're following us.
Travis: Really?
Sam: What do we do?
Travis: You know, it was probably you told such a good story, they're just fascinated by you now.
Sam: What do I do? I've never been followed by guards before.
Travis: You should probably act casual. Or you could drop some money on the ground, and let all the people run and collect it, and make a diversion. It's up to you.
Sam: Are there people around?
Matt: There's a few.
Travis: Just dump all your money on the ground. They'll come out of the houses, the woodworks.
Sam: I was warned about you and money. I won't listen to that. But I will try to act casual. I will just take off my gigantic, diamond-encrusted helmet. Let my hair down.
Travis: How long is his long, blonde hair?
Matt: Just past the shoulders.
Travis: Just free-flowing? No fancy braids or buns or anything?
Matt: No, just free-flowing, perfectly arced in the front, except pulled back because of the helmet. It's glorious. It's Bee Gee-tastic.
Sam: (loudly) Ah, what a day, am I right?
Travis: You're talking real loud.
Sam: (softly) That's what casual people do.
Travis: No. They don't.
Sam: They don't care what people think.
Travis: Volume control, real important.
Sam: Okay. (loudly) Ah, just want to take a load off and just rest here for a while. Not going anywhere, just sitting here and acting real boring, right?
Travis: Yep. How are we going to stay here and find the health potions at the same time?
Sam: Guide me. You've been doing this longer.
Travis: No, you're really doing well. I'm learning a lot right now. Clearly, you are a well-traveled man of mystery.
Sam: All right, I've read about situations like this, right? We just need to create a diversion. While the guards are diverted, we run away, fast as we can, right?
Travis: I literally told you about that one minute ago.
Sam: Yes. (all laugh)
Sam: Here's my plan.
Matt: Grog, make a perception check.
Travis: 15.
Matt: You're getting close to the exterior of the building pointed to by the guards, and you recognize it. It's the place where you've previously purchased potions.
Travis: Look, I hate to interrupt, right. Do you think you've done anything wrong?
Sam: Illegal?
Travis: Yeah. Have you done anything wrong?
Sam: I don't think so, no.
Travis: You've never been here before?
Sam: Well, we are traveling around with an arcane being. I don't know if that's illegal.
Travis: Yeah, it's totally fine. Look, this place is where the goods are.
Sam: You mean potions and magical items?
Travis: All sorts of stuff. I don't even know if his inventory has improved since we've last been here, but he will give you a really great deal, and it'll give you a chance to prove to me how good of a salesman you are.
Sam: All right. But how do we shake the uards-gay?
Travis: What?
Sam: Well, that came out weird. Didn't think that through. (all laugh)
Travis: I mean, the motherfucking pig-latin. Jesus.
Sam: What they do in the comfort of their own home is their own--
Travis: I don't think there's any shaking them, right. Why don't you leave old twinkle-toes outside, and we go in? Surely Doty can read or something?
Sam: He can stay here and keep watch, but if they ask him anything, he will be--
Travis: Mute.
Sam: Is that all right, do you think?
Travis: What's wrong with that?
Sam: All right.
Travis: Maybe just tell him to be cool.
Sam: Doty.
Matt: Which, as you turn, you see he's been drawing in his book the entire time, everything you guys have been discussing.
Sam: Doty. Act cool. That means book down, don't say a word, and if the guards get close, let us know with some sort of sound. Thank you. Remember, you're a leper, so seem unhealthy.
Matt: (lopsided mechanical footsteps) Horrible creaking sounds.
Sam: Good. All right, let's go inside.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So, the guards are closing the gap a little bit. You guys pick up pace, they pick up pace a little bit. You get to the outside of the building. The doors are closed. You open them and get inside. The warm interior is lit up. You can see there's nobody else currently inside, except for your old friend, the potion-seller, who's currently reading what looks to be some sort of a-- you're not actually sure what's inside the book, but it's a small, handheld book, and he's reading through, bored. "No. No. No."
Travis: No, no. She's not here. It's just me and my new, rich friend. Rich.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Travis: Natural 20.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Travis: That's what it says.
Matt: "She's not here?"
Travis: She's not here. It's just the two of us.
Matt: "And your friend's very rich?"
Sam: Extremely.
Travis: Do you see what he is covered in?
Matt: "What is that?"
Sam: Just outside the door there?
Matt: "Yes."
Sam: He's a man.
Matt: "Great. Well then." (all laugh)
Travis: Nice. Slick.
Matt: "So what can I get you? I've got all sorts of salves and spices. We've got all sorts of incense. What are you looking for?"
Travis: Inside the shop, has it grown or become more ornate since we've last been here?
Matt: It does, actually. Last time you were here it was in the process of being put together. The shop seems to be fully open now and outfitted, though it doesn't seem to be getting much traffic, as it is very empy. So he seems eager he has customers. And now much more put at ease, now that you've let him know that from his vision, the dragon woman did not come with you.
Travis: Yeah. (laughs) You first.
Sam: Oh, for myself, do you have any spell scrolls, or any sort of one-use items that I could use in a fight or a tangle with some bad chaps?
Matt: "Let me see what I've got."
Sam: Things that could deceive, things that could use force against--
Matt: And he rummages through a couple of scroll pieces. Let's see here what he might have. "I do, should you be so interested, currently carry one scroll that would surround with you a wreath of dangerous fire."
Sam: Oh, all right. Just around me, or around an area?
Matt: "Just around you. Anything that came too close would burst into flames and be burned."
Sam: I have 13 of those right here. Do you have anything else?
Travis: Not that that's not really impressive.
Sam: It's really good.
Matt: "I've got something that makes you jump."
Sam: I've got that.
Matt: "I've got something that makes you see in the dark."
Sam: Yeah, I have a light already. (all laugh)
Matt: "What do you want?"
Sam: All right, give me that one scroll, the fire scroll. I could sell it and get something else.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: How much is that?
Matt: I'm looking right now for the scroll that's here.
Travis: You have to read the scroll, right?
Sam: I could read it to you. If that's what you're asking.
Matt: He looks you over. "The scroll I would put at a fair 6,000 gold pieces."
Sam: (gulps) Watch how it's done. I'm going to put an amount of gold on the table. I'd like you to consider it, and if it's to your liking, take it, and if not, just shake your head. And I'll put 200 gold on the table. I'll put 200 more. I'll put 2,000 more. And another 2,000.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Travis: 4,400.
Sam: 17. Plus seven! 24.
Matt: Takes the gold.
Travis: Wow!
Sam: Check and mate.
Travis: Check'n'mate?
Matt: You now have a scroll of fire shield.
Sam: Scroll of fire shield, excellent. I don't know what that is.
Travis: Wow. Do you have anything that makes you faster?
Matt: "I said I have something that makes you jump."
Travis: No. I'm pretty good at jumping. What about regular healing potions?
Matt: "That I've got! You cleared me out of my other various vials last time."
Travis: No new exotics came in?
Matt: "No, I'm waiting on-- Trade's been a little slow. Looks like things are getting up in Emon, so hopefully we'll have more soon. But for the time being, I do have some more healing potions." And he goes into the back room, and you hear him rummaging for a minute. You hear one crate fall over and a couple of things shatter. "Ah god damn--". And eventually he comes back through the door, and he's holding in his arms a few clusters of various glass vials. Some of them have been repurposed and taped at the top, but they're functional. He sets them down on the counter. "All right. I have six potions of healing, and I have three of greater healing, and one superior."
Sam: Do I know how much these things tend to cost?
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Sam: Ooh! This is not a save.
Matt: Yes, just add your modifier.
Sam: 20!
Matt: Yes, actually. The healing potions can range around 75 to 100 gold pieces generally. The uncommon ones can range somewhere in the 500 gold pieces range. The superior, however, are much rarer to come by, and the fact he even has one, with how recently you guys cleared him out, it's pretty decent. That one can run anywhere between 4,000-5,000 gold pieces.
Sam: And it's six, three, and one? Is that right?
Matt: Six, three, and one.
Travis: Do you want to get them? It seems like you got all the money in the world.
Sam: I can heal myself just fine, but I don't know about your friends-- do they have healing abilities?
Travis: No, not-- well they do, they touch you with their hand and then like all of a sudden it feels a bit better.
Sam: A bit better?
Travis: Yeah. I don't really know how that works.
Sam: But they use potions. I've seen them use potions.
Travis: Yeah, I'm normally pouring them in their mouths.
Sam: Do you think they would appreciate these?
Travis: I don't know, I hadn't thought that far. As a (mumbling) new member of Vox Machina--
Sam: What was that?
Travis: Bad allergies here. It could be like a really great gift, you know? Like Keyleth gave you.
Sam: -- welcome-me-to-the-gang gift.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Do you gift-wrap, here, sir?
Matt: "For an additional charge, yes, of course, I gift wrap!"
Sam: -- of course for an additional charge. What if we took the whole lot of those for 6,000 gold?
Matt: "The whole lot? For 6,000. I'm afraid that is far under the price I'd be considering. Let me see here." And he does some kind of notations, and he goes, "Hm. You seem, from our previous experience, to be quite the bargainer, my friend."
Travis: Yeah, the brains.
Matt: "How would you say to the fair price of 10,000 gold pieces for the batch?"
Travis: Let me confer with my partner. (whispers) How many on your hands is that? Yeah, no-- both hands, how many?
Sam: All.
Travis: Two?
Sam: Oh. Wait. (all laugh)
Sam: It's too much.
Travis: Too much.
Sam: Yes. This man is insulting your intelligence, and you should be very angry right now.
Travis: How about 9,000 gold pieces?
Matt: "Mm, you drive a very hard bargain, my big friend, however! Because it's you? Deal."
Travis: Done! Pay the man.
Sam: I would object to this. This is coming out of my purse, and I insist that you negotiate with me, and not--
Travis: Tary, this man drives a really well-known establishment. If we leave here, after having struck that bargain, and we don't pay? There will be more guards outside.
Sam: (gulps) How about this. I can trade you something worth far more than the extra 3,000 gold this gentleman promised you.
Matt: "What would this be?"
Sam: It's a rare egg. Magical in nature. It can save a life, in any situation. And if you eat it when you are nearly dead, you will go back into battle with the strength and bravery of ten men, and you will not rest until your foes are dead.
Matt: Make a persuasion check. This isn't deception because you believe this wholeheartedly.
Sam: Is this deception or persuasion?
Matt: This is persuasion.
Sam: 22.
Matt: "6,000 and the egg, you say? Very well." He pushes the--
Sam: Gentle!
Matt: "I will be." He goes over and quickly reaches over and grabs a thick towel-like pile of cloth, and wraps it up carefully. "Ooh." Sets it down. "A pleasure doing business with you all."
Sam: Ah-ah-ah. The gift-wrapping? (all laugh)
Matt: "Terribly sorry. My apologies. I'll be right to it." And he turns and leaves the room.
Travis: Tary, that was a personal gift from me to you.
Sam: I know, but we're partners, as you just said, and I felt that you would approve of me doing so.
Travis: I suppose I am a bit proud.
Matt: (loud clanging)
Sam: What was that?
Matt: You hear behind you guys in the doorway--
Sam: Oh shit. Oh shit.
Matt: -- some of the impacts of metal, rapidly and heavily.
Travis: What?
Sam: Sword!
Travis: Oh Jesus.
Matt: You watch, (whoosh), whips into a longsword. And you glance behind and you see, walking through the doorway, the very heavy, hulking figure of Doty, carrying two unconscious guards that are hanging from his hands.
Sam: Oh shit.
Travis: What did you do? Give me those! I punch them both, one time each, in the jaw, just for extra measure.
Matt: Okay. Both jaws are very broken.
Travis: Your guy really did a number. Cool. Okay. (all laugh)
Travis: Everybody's going to die, all right? So we're going to kill everyone that we see in the next ten seconds.
Sam: Wait, we're killing them? Even the shop owner?
Travis: Yeah, he's got to die.
Sam: Oh shit. All right. Partners, right? I'll do whatever you say.
Travis: Is there a counter in the shop?
Matt: Yeah, there's a counter in the front area.
Travis: Is it wooden?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can he see through the counter?
Matt: No, the proprietor is in the back room. He's wrapping your stuff right now.
Sam: He doesn't know this happened. Let's get rid of them. Get rid of them.
Travis: Well, what's in the shop? Is there a tapestry, is there a rug?
Matt: It's not a very big-- There is a secondary room to the side where it looks like there is an upper platform, but that looks like where his bedroom is, maybe.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Matt: There's a couple of lanterns, it's a warm-lit interior, and as you're looking around, it's not a huge establishment. Make a perception check.
Travis: Yeah. Two.
Matt: You have no idea! You're panicking.
Travis: I saw this in a tavern once. Let's sit them up like they're just sleeping and nobody will notice.
Sam: They have jaws-- the blood! Their jaws are terrible!
Travis: Well, didn't you put a mask on Dotty? Let's do it again.
Sam: I can't! I don't have extra masks.
Travis: No, it will be no problem.
Sam: We can put them somewhere else.
Travis: I sit one up in the corner, and I sit the other one, and lean it on his shoulder.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh my god. What?
Travis: This is great. Don't worry.
Sam: Even I can tell that those are two--
Travis: I have an even better idea! I take the cask of ale out of the bag of holding, and I just start pouring ale all over them.
Sam: Why would they be in here drinking? They're guards on duty!
Travis: They're terrible guards. They make horrible life choices. They're in the wrong line of work. I take two chalices and I throw it in their laps. Cool. Now I need you to vomit on them.
Sam: I can't vomit.
Travis: Do it right now. Put your finger down your throat and puke on these guards.
Matt: Make an intimidation check, Grog.
Travis: 17! Puke on those fucking guards!
Sam: What do I roll?
Matt: I'm going to say, make an insight check. Sure.
Sam: 16.
Travis: Vomit on those bitches.
Sam: (dry heaving)
Matt: And that's going to be giffed forever. (all laugh)
Matt: Make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Natural 20.
Matt: About 30 seconds of you trying to gag yourself pass, before the shop owner comes back, with these beautifully packaged healing potions. "All right, so--"
Sam: One second! One second.
Travis: I'm really sorry. These two gentlemen obviously have been off their ass. They came in here, smelling of booze, looking for something to make them feel better, I don't know, and they just passed out in the corner. Is there someone you know that we can call? I really hate just leaving them here.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Marisha: Oh my god. Come on, Grog!
Taliesin: Please a four.
Travis: Nine.
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: He slowly hands out this really nice bundle, and it has a little bow on it and it's wrapped, and he hands it out to you and just goes, "Please, take this and never come back. Please."
Travis: For the rest of the day?
Matt: "Ever again. Your presence has brought me no end of pain. Just go."
Travis: Obviously, we've gotten the better end of this deal.
Sam: I think that that is true, absolutely.
Travis: Do you still have the--
Matt: "Go!"
Travis: We should go. We should leave.
Sam: All right. Thank you for your--
Matt: (incoherent noises)
Sam: Good day to you. Let's go. Doty, come.
Travis: Bidet.
Matt: Doty turns. "Ahh!" And comes running after you guys as you exit the shop.
Liam: Holy shit.
Taliesin: That was amazing. I don't feel good.
Marisha: Wow.
Travis: Good job. We've got to go. We've got to hole up somewhere for a minute. You know. A drink?
Sam: Please.
Travis: Yeah. Is there a tavern near this shop?
Matt: In the Quad Roads? Yeah. There's actually quite a few taverns.
Sam: As soon as we step outside, I barf all over the floor. (all laugh)
Travis: Where was that? What the fuck?
Sam: I'm sorry. It just comes naturally. I can't force it.
Travis: You can't perform on command? I needed you. Okay, you got more in there?
Sam: No.
Travis: It's just a one-er?
Sam: Maybe a little.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: (barfs)
Travis: Okay. That looks like Lucky Charms.
Matt: Okay. While you guys get a drink, we're going to get a quick bathroom break. We have a couple more beats we want to get through before the night's end. We're not going to go too long, trust me. But we're going to take a quick bathroom break, and then we'll come back here in a few minutes. We do have one more giveaway here tonight from our awesome friends at Wyrmwood. We have a dice box here, signed by the cast of Critical Role. It is a birch dice box. Do we have a code for the chat room?
Crew: Wyrmwood!
Matt: Wyrmwood. Go ahead and use, one word, Wyrmwood, in the chat room on Twitch. We'll have a break, and we'll have a winner announced for you when we get back.
Marisha: Wyrmwood with a 'y'.
Matt: Yes, Wyrmwood with a 'y', as in the actual company. Thank you guys so much. We'll see you in a few minutes. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. So, first and foremost, we have our winner in the chat room. 'OnlyTwentiesAllowed'. Great name, by the way. You won the contest for this week. We're going to go ahead and get your information, and send you your Wyrmwood box. Thank you again, Wyrmwood, for sending that so we can get that to you guys for free as the contest weekly. Back into the story we were. So, you guys are drinking and laying low.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: You guys were making your way to the library, you said?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: We're going to finish up and try and get out, I guess?
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I would also like to definitely talk about maybe having access later, to come back at some point.
Marisha: We want to talk to Kusuo and see.
Taliesin: Just on our way out.
Matt: On the way out, as the tomes are placed and locked back up, you talk to Kusuo. "That is not a worry. Just make sure that you request me when you arrive."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "It would be my pleasure."
Taliesin: Thank you so much. And I hope that that book finds a proper home and is worthwhile. Thank you for your time.
Marisha: Thank you. And would it be possible if we bring friends of ours in the future who are--
Taliesin: Of our group.
Marisha: Yeah, who are fluent in these languages.
Matt: "But of course. Just make sure that you accompany them."
Taliesin: Of course.
Marisha: Thank you.
Matt: He leads you out. You guys exit the library just as Vax and Vex, after finding information on where to go, arrive.
Laura: Do you guys have the book?
Taliesin: We do.
Marisha: We totally do.
Laura: What the fuck?
Marisha: I know-- I thought-- You know, I think-- I don't know.
Laura: What did you find?
Marisha: Well, some good stuff.
Taliesin: It actually went quite well.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: We found one book that we could read, and one book that we couldn't.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: So we'll have to come back with you guys. Because it was all written in Abyssal.
Laura: We can read that!
Marisha: Yes! Because your father forced you to do things.
Taliesin: Don't they all. Speaking of fathers forcing you to do things, we have to deal with you. We have a starting point for the rakshasa.
Laura: Wonderful.
Taliesin: So, soon, when it's time, step one will be the City of Dis.
Laura: The City of Dis?
Taliesin: Dis City. Not this city, but the City of Dis.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: We built Dis city.
Taliesin: Did you build Dis city?
Marisha: On rock'n'roll.
Liam: Can I have that book please?
Taliesin: Oh, yes! Hi. Yes, this is-- Yes.
Liam: I'm just going to hold on to that.
Taliesin: Are you going to hold on-- Do we have a bag to put that in?
Laura: We have Grog's bag of holding, the same one we've always had. Hey, is there somewhere we could buy a fucking bag of holding?
Travis: They're kind of rare.
Matt: They're not expensive.
Travis: To Grog, they're rare.
Matt: But you could ask around and try to find somebody. It'll take a little time. You guys are right now hitting the cusp of dawn. Sorry, dusk.
Laura: Is there somewhere I could find before things close? Just to see?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Oh, balls. That's terrible.
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: I rolled 13.
Matt: You manage to find one location, but it's been closed for half an hour when you get there.
Laura: Fuck! Fuck. Fine. It's fine.
Taliesin: It's in Los Angeles.
Travis: Pittsburgh.
Marisha: Pittsburgh, yeah.
Laura: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yeah?
Laura: How about we go see your dad.
Marisha: (laughs nervously)
Liam: Are we tabling the book, then?
Taliesin: We're going to drop it off, I think.
Marisha: What did you guys find out? Is it a good spot, a good home for it? Do you want to drop it off?
Laura: They definitely are interested in it at the Platinum Sanctuary.
Liam: A little too interested for my taste.
Taliesin: You think?
Liam: Yes. I don't want this book in anyone's hands, frankly.
Laura: They were very interested in researching it. Which I don't think is a bad thing. They're good people. And learning about history is a good way to keep yourself from repeating it. However, you do serve the Raven Queen, who I know wants nothing to do with the undead. And if it means destroying this book, then do what needs to be done.
Taliesin: Can we destroy this book?
Marisha: It's like our magical items. It's not easy to destroy them. Seems like a pretty powerful book.
Taliesin: The fear I have with the book is of course if we keep it, we keep it out of the hands of everyone, save those who are finally strong enough to best us.
Liam: Do we want this book to travel to hell?
Marisha: Ooh, no.
Taliesin: No, no.
Marisha: But it might not be a bad-- I mean, we did drop off the horn of Orcus here.
Liam: I'll tell you what. Why don't you guys get everything set to go, and I will drop this off.
Marisha: What? Where? There? Where?
Taliesin: Oh. Oh.
Liam: Yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
Marisha: You're going to go back to the temple.
Taliesin: That's a terrible idea. I kind of like it. That's not a good thing. I think it's a good idea. That may not be a good thing.
Liam: Do you want to come with me?
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: I hook him by the arm and we just start off.
Taliesin: Find a bar!
Marisha: I'll get things packed?
Laura: It was my idea! Go fuck yourself.
Liam: Love you!
Marisha: I look at Vex.
Laura: Dresses? Oh, everything's fucking closed!
Marisha: Oh goddamnit, Pittsburgh.
Laura: Are there dress shops open? At all?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: This ain't New York City.
Laura: We just want pretty dresses. Oh! Oh! Oh!
Marisha: Get it, girl. Get it, get it, girl.
Laura: 25.
Matt: You do manage to find one individual who is in the process of closing their formal attire shop.
Marisha: I toss them 20 gold. An extra 20 minutes, please.
Matt: "But of course! Come on in."
Marisha: Thank you.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: Ah! Everything's better!
Matt: (laughs) All right.
Laura: Keyleth?
Marisha: What?
Laura: What's good for your Ashari people? Something covered in grass, maybe?
Marisha: Mm.
Laura: Turf? Astro-turf?
Marisha: You know, it's a little esoteric for me. A little experimental. A little Gaga-esque.
Laura: Lots of pink bows, maybe, for me.
Marisha: You know, it reminds a little of when we dressed Trinket up in pink bows.
Laura: Right, and we could be like--
Marisha: I don't know if that's a good thing.
Laura: Help us. Make us pretty.
Marisha: Make us pretty.
Laura: And very expensive looking.
Marisha: I'm going to become royalty. Kind of, but not really.
Laura: It's my first time getting to dress up as royalty.
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: "All right. That-- Okay." The gentleman seems a bit overwhelmed, but quickly goes ahead and helps you guys find, over the next 30 or so minutes, some very nice dresses. Better than anything you've previously worn. And he gets you something that he thinks royalty should wear. As there is no real royalty in Vasselheim, it is a church-run state. It is more of a frumpy robe with a fur collar.
Marisha: Vex, this collar is so big.
Laura: This is terrible. Give her something flowy.
Marisha: Why can't I see over it?
Matt: "Flowy. Of course. I'm so sorry. Flowy, yes." He's starting to get a little impatient, but does manage to pull one very nice simple gown, that just hangs off the shoulders and pools on the ground around you.
Laura: In all the colors. Can it be in all the colors?
Marisha: Yeah, can we dip-dye it blue?
Matt: "Dye? I could have it dyed. That would be by tomorrow morning prepared."
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matt: "All right, I'll get it taken care of."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: All right. While that's happening, you two are heading to the Raven's Crest?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. So you guys walk over to the Dusk Meadow. You're met by the same gray, slightly bleak atmosphere on this side of Vasselheim. But you make your way to the exterior of the large structure. The ominous obsidian and gold building that represents the center, if you will, the beating heart of the Raven Queen's worship. As you approach the front stairway, both of you familiar with, one brought in, the other not met with any living person for the most part in your journey, you both approach-- still arms hooked?
Liam: No.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I suspect you've been here before.
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: (sighs) I like that things are better between you and I now.
Taliesin: I feel the same. I like that most things are better now. Not everything, but it's a brighter world, even for us.
Liam: Do you know what I like? I like the version of you that my sister brings out.
Taliesin: I do too. I'll do my best to keep him in the forefront. And as for you: I like the version of you that's not afraid. So let's go meet this terrible thing, drop off the book, get you feeling a bit better.
Liam: (clears throat) Come on.
Taliesin: Fuck. (clears throat)
Matt: As you both ascend the stairs, you see standing-- previously not noticed as you guys were having a conversation-- but off to the sides of each side of the entryway, the two doors that are closed, there are two women in long black gowns with dark veils that drift over their head to the mid torso, that you had lead you into the chamber initially. Both suddenly present themselves, bow, and step out of the side as the chamber doors open to the interior of the Raven's Crest temple. There, standing as the doors open, is what looks to be an older woman wearing the same attire, the same dark veil, somewhat able to see her features beneath the dark material that hangs in front of her. She steps forward as the doors open.
Liam: Hello there. You recognize me. This is my friend. We bring you an offering for the Queen.
Matt: The woman bends down, takes the tome from your hand. She holds it, she takes her fingers and brushes the cloth away that currently obscures the tome, takes a look at it, holds it a foot further away from her face, and throws the cloth over the front, clasps it in her arms and brings it down towards her torso. And, for the first time since this-- you've heard her speak before, you have done this before-- but the strange eerie kind of airy whisper comes out from this older woman as she bends forward, clutching this tome. "We thank you. And we will be sure that this finds its final seal."
Liam: She has begun to speak to me. Her desires are not clear, entirely, but I am listening. And I intend to learn.
Matt: "Good."
Liam: We have to go. But I mean to come back.
Matt: "Whenever you're ready. The vision of the gods is obscured beyond the Divine Gate. We are not just their tools but their extensions. The creations that act as their fingers in this plane. The center of all other life and death. Be watchful. Be vigilant." She bows, and backs into the Raven's Crest once more as the doors close, the two other women now flanking out of the shadows and stepping before each door, and seemingly just not paying attention to your presence.
Taliesin: I was envious of you once. God. So sorry. (sighs)
Liam: (whispers) Good day.
Matt: They make no response as you guys turn and make your way down the stairs from the Raven's Crest.
Taliesin: Just so you know, it is your duty to have some joy in the meantime. You do know that, right? You're no use to her a wreck. She needs a man. Have a fucking beer. And I slap him on the ass as we walk towards the pub.
Liam: Look over my shoulder at the temple as we walk. Come on, let's get drunk.
Matt: As your head moves forward, walking, you feel this cold tingle just drift down the back of your neck and spine, then it fades, and you keep walking, carrying on your chest there a brief, warm secondary heartbeat representing the brief boon granted upon you by the Raven Queen. You catch up with the ladies at the bar.
Marisha: Hey!
Laura: (laugh)
Sam: (laugh)
Taliesin: I shove Keyleth at him. Fix that, good god.
Liam: (laughs)
Taliesin: Ahh.
Liam: Scoop and lift.
Marisha: Are you broken again?
Liam: No.
Marisha: Ah.
Liam: I need a drink, have you had one already?
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: I'm fine.
Laura: She's had a few.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Matt: You guys, you've found dresses that are to your liking. You've-- the cost of them with the materials would probably run about 20 gold apiece.
Laura: I think that's acceptable.
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: Designer.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Taliesin: Couture.
Marisha: Couture.
Laura: I can't believe these dresses are so much cheaper than a healing potion.
Marisha: I know.
Laura: Ridiculous.
Marisha: It's like, look at the beading!
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: It's crazy!
Laura: Wait, we're picking them up in the morning, Keyleth. You're not even wearing it yet.
Marisha: In the morning, I'll look at the beading. (all laugh)
Marisha: It's crazy.
Taliesin: That's sweat, yes.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah. Ah, where are Grog and Taryon?
Laura: Oh, we haven't heard from them in a long time.
Taliesin: Grog, Taryon!
Laura: Grog!
Travis: Can we hear them?
Matt: You were still in the Quad Roads, keeping low. You guys are both-- you're able to hear them. Whatever you guys have been up to trying to stay out of sight.
Travis: Yes?
Taliesin: We're at a bar, where are you?
Travis: Funny, we are doing something similar. Are you done?
Taliesin: No, we're just starting. You--
Sam: Are they talking to you right now?
Travis: Yeah, they are.
Taliesin: Is that Taryon?
Sam: Just tell them to--
Taliesin: Tell him we say hello.
Travis: All right. The two fucking people talking to--
Sam: Tell them--
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Did you buy potions?
Sam: Can we ask them where they are?
Taliesin: I need to talk to Taryon.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Ask them where they are.
Taliesin: Tell Taryon to take you where we all are right now
Sam: Tell them where we are right now, and ask them where they are.
Taliesin: Just have him bring us to us-- I'll give you directions. It'll be fine.
Sam: Tell them--
Travis: My real-world ADD is fully maxed out. (all laugh)
Travis: I just heard a bunch of sea lions barking like, "Ar ar ar ar." It was nothing. Oh fuck.
Taliesin: Why don't you two come join us?
Travis: I reach over, I cover Tary's mouth. Percy?
Taliesin: Yes?
Travis: Let me know when you're done.
Taliesin: Are you sure? We're drinking. You can join.
Travis: All right. What tavern are you in?
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to send you the psychic information of where we are right now.
Travis: You can do that?
Laura: I want to say the name of it.
Marisha: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Matt: Okay. Vex lets you know that this is the-- shit, what is it? What tavern would this be here? Let me go through.
Taliesin: Can't you just bullshit? You have to actually look up the real name?
Sam: No, there's two bars in Vasselheim!
Matt: There are a lot of bars in Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah. It's-- the other bar would actually be enough.
Laura: The other bar.
Matt: The Siren's Succor.
Laura: (mystical voice) We're in the Siren's Succor.
Travis: Oh my god, I heard it.
Taliesin: Isn't that amazing?
Travis: My powers are getting stronger.
Taliesin: I've gone beyond the veil.
Travis: All right. We'll make our way over to you.
Taliesin: I've gained such power.
Laura: (mystical voice) Meet us soon. Did you buy potions?
Travis: Are you asking me to buy potions, Percy?
Taliesin: No, I want you to come straight to the bar. Straight to the bar.
Travis: But I thought you just sent me a request for--
Taliesin: I was thinking about something else. No, you just heard me thinking about something else.
Travis: All right, we'll have to fine-tune my abilities.
Taliesin: You'll get there.
Travis: All right.
Taliesin: I have every faith.
Marisha: You're doing really well at perfecting your mystical voice.
Travis: Oh my god, I hear two voices.
Marisha: Yeah, it's good. It's good. I like it.
Liam: Freddie. Order me something that rich people drink.
Laura: Beer! (laughs)
Taliesin: Get him--
Laura: Some wine.
Liam: Is that it? I've done beer.
Taliesin: Get him a giant glass of half Guinness, half whatever cider they have.
Laura: Ugh.
Taliesin: Rich people get drunk. Oh, do you want something fancy?
Liam: Yeah!
Taliesin: Okay, I take the black and tan.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: Oh, black and tan.
Taliesin: And I get him a tiny glass of creme de menthe. (laughs)
Liam: This one tells me that you have the goods, so I want the goods. Want the goods.
Taliesin: I don't know how to feel a little awkward in saying I'm not sure I want to waste it on you. But--
Liam: We're in a bar, you fucker. Buy me a drink, you asshole. I've saved your life like three times.
Taliesin: I wait for her to nod. Okay, that's enough.
Marisha: What do you mean by the goods?
Taliesin: Oh dear. I pull up-- I tip the barman because I'm showing him that I'm pulling something out for some glassware.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Because I'm not an asshole.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: Well--
Sam: (incredulous sound) (all laugh)
Taliesin: And then I pour a little bit of the Tear Whiskey. Of the Green Tear.
Liam: Mm.
Taliesin: It's mean. It's minty. You'll love it.
Liam: Hm.
Taliesin: We have it every year.
Marisha: Where did you keep that?
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: Where'd you just pull that from?
Taliesin: Okay, do you actually want me to answer? You can say yes, it's all right. It's not going to get weird. That's all right. I'm going to tell you anyway.
Marisha: Whoa. Jeez.
Taliesin: See this belt? It's got a series of these little--
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Taliesin: -- things on. Those are mostly filled with little bits of gunpowder I have wrapped up in the thing.
Liam: That's all?
Marisha: Right.
Taliesin: These last four are liquor.
Marisha: (gasps)
Taliesin: Sh.
Marisha: That's so smart.
Taliesin: That's how I can just stand everywhere among their being idiots, is I'm really trashed.
Marisha: Wow. And probably much cheaper than just buying in bars all the time.
Taliesin: Yeah. Oh yeah. No, I'm-- well. I like to--
Marisha: Wow.
Taliesin: -- drink what we-- the locals.
Laura: I'm staring at the door waiting for Grog and Taryon.
Matt: You have to take the pre-gaming feat to actually use that ability.
Taliesin: What? Oh--
Matt: (laughs) At that point, you watch as Grog's hands hit the doorway and he sheepishly looks in, checking the surroundings for any possible--
Laura: Grog.
Travis: How busy is it in the tavern?
Matt: It's actually pretty sparse, aside from your friends, maybe two other individuals.
Travis: Okay. Come in. Come inside. Listen.
Matt: Okay. Tary comes in and (crashing sound) behind you. Doty.
Travis: No, sh. Gah. Sh.
Marisha: Hey! Oh, sorry.
Laura: I forgot how weird Doty looks.
Travis: Sh. Jeez. Just bring it down a notch.
Taliesin: This is so-- Oh. Hm.
Travis: Apparently, Dotty had a bit of a run-in with some of that Vasselheim--
Laura: Did you get it? Did you finally get it?
Marisha: (laughs)
Sam: Did you get it?
Travis: Yeah. (all laugh)
Taliesin: For those of you at home, this thing has been just driving us nuts.
Laura: It's been all night.
Liam: It's a stirge.
Travis: We had a bit of a run-in--
Matt: It's fine.
Travis: -- and Doty may or may not have paddy-caked some of the guards, so, like, we need to remove--
Sam: (tearfully) Doty killed two guards. He just killed them. They're dead.
Travis: Well, there it is.
Sam: (tearfully) They're dead!
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: (tearfully) He killed two guards.
Laura: He killed them?
Travis: He's been like this.
Sam: (tearfully) We didn't tell him to! He just did.
Laura: Did he really kill them?
Liam: But did the disguise work?
Sam: I actually think it did. Actually.
Travis: He's been doing this for about half an hour, so--
Taliesin: Half full. He'll have a glass of something half full. Thank--
Marisha: What? What did you tell Doty? What did you inform him right before--
Liam: Are you sure they were dead? Are they just fucked up?
Travis: I think they were--
Matt: Doty is writing all this down by the way.
Marisha: Potentially murdered the-- Doty!
Sam: This is evidence, Doty!
Marisha: I might-- Oh.
Travis: Look, Percy. Vax.
Sam: Ugh.
Laura: Dear diary.
Travis: I think you you need to remove--
Laura: I have an itty bitty metal penis. (all laugh)
Travis: You need to remove--
Taliesin: Leave that there.
Travis: -- Doty's disguise.
Taliesin: No.
Sam: No, no! Oh, because they might recognize him as the murderer?
Travis: Yeah. They'll be looking for a giant red-haired--
Taliesin: Wait.
Travis: -- eight-foot-tall--
Sam: No. What we need to do is put another disguise on top of this one. (all laugh)
Travis: You're right.
Taliesin: Doty. Doty. Did you actually expire two soldiers?
Laura: As he's doing this, I pull out some lipstick and I start drawing lipstick on his face, to try to turn him boy to girl.
Matt: Doesn't resist.
Taliesin: You ask and he listens to you.
Liam: Is there a mop anywhere in the room?
Marisha: What?
Liam: In this room?
Matt: Not within visual--
Liam: No.
Marisha: You want me to ask Doty? Or you want me to ask Tary?
Matt: -- vicinity. You could ask.
Liam: What about drapes on the windows?
Sam: He won't answer any of you.
Taliesin: Ask him if he actually just hurt, or if they're--
Matt: Not in this tavern, no.
Marisha: -- just unconscious.
Taliesin: Maybe he just punched them a couple times.
Sam: Greg knows.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: Ah, that's close enough.
Sam: Did you kill them, with those punches of fury?
Taliesin: Did you?
Travis: I did.
Marisha: Are you sure? Did you check?
Travis: I don't know. I'm really strong these days.
Marisha: Grog.
Liam: Insight check Grog.
Taliesin: I'm joining in on this insight check. I call bullshit.
Matt: (laughs) Sure.
Liam: Well, that's a one.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: I'm not wasting Luck on it.
Matt: He fucking killed two people.
Taliesin: 13.
Liam: Jeez, man.
Laura: Grog.
Travis: It was like an act of mercy, really.
Liam: Did they attack you?
Matt: Grog, make a deception check.
Travis: No, no.
Sam: Oh, boy.
Laura: (nervous sound)
Travis: 19. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Fuck.
Matt: Grog fucking killed two people!
Travis: 20.
Laura: What? 20!
Liam: Why? Were you in danger?
Laura: This is what happens when Pike isn't around!
Travis: No no.
Liam: Why?
Travis: Look, from what I understand, these guards were attracted to the horrific disguise that Doty had. He knocked them out, brought them in. I checked for, like, a pulse, checked their knee reflexes, and they were on death's door, so I just finished the deal.
Marisha: Okay--
Travis: It was really merciful.
Marisha: That doesn't--
Taliesin: I'm feeling slightly better but slightly worse?
Liam: What a clusterfuck.
Laura: Did anyone see you do it?
Sam: We're not sure, Doty did this outside without us being--
Laura: Doty, did anyone see you do that to the guards?
Sam: He won't answer you. Doty, did anyone witness your crime?
Matt: (squeaking "I don't know" sound)
Marisha: Tary, what do you mean you didn't tell him to-- he just did this on --
Sam: I told him to protect us! He's my protector. He does what needs to be done to protect me.
Marisha: (sighs) Tary, is this thing safe to be following us around?
Travis: Yeah, no, he's really impressive actually. Have a little more respect.
Laura: Maybe you shouldn't bring him into cities. Maybe that should just be a rule.
Liam: Was there no other choice?
Laura: Doty doesn't come into cities.
Travis: Well, I don't know, we weren't--
Taliesin: We let the bear come into bars.
Laura: Well, yeah, Trinket is well-behaved.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Laura: Doty kills people.
Sam: Well, to be fair, Greg killed the people.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Doty merely roughed them up.
Travis: And to be even more fair, they'd been drinking all day. Smelled like alcohol. (all laugh)
Matt: And he does.
Taliesin: Are we still buying this?
Marisha: No way we'd buy that delivery!
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: You bet your ass you do, that's a 20!
Marisha: Can I roll an insight check? That's bullshit!
Travis: That's a 20!
Matt: You can.
Marisha: There's no fucking way!
Matt: You can, go ahead and make an insight check.
Marisha: What? Oh, bullshit. That was the most bullshit delivery.
Laura: Yeah, can I try? Can I try too?
Travis: I'm never gonna roll that high again.
Liam: Please, save us from this moral dilemma!
Marisha: Mm, mm, 21!
Laura: Oh!
Matt: You are the first person not to believe Grog's story.
Marisha: (quietly) Grog.
Laura: (laughs)
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Do we need to make sure you're with an adult from here on out? Can you not be trusted alone with Tary?
Laura: Did you buy potions?
Sam: I have quite a gift for you!
Laura: For me?
Matt: It looks like a--
Sam: For all of you.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: No, no! Do not! Do not be influenced by his very generous act of kindness! That was so kind of you!
Sam: I think you'll find something for everyone in there.
Travis: Is there a little bit of vomit on there?
Matt: Like a little. Spatter. It's dried by now.
Marisha: That was like 6,000 gold worth of-- But do not! Don't!
Taliesin: Is this blood on the-- yep--
Travis: No, that's vomit.
Taliesin: Oh, that's good.
Travis: Yup.
Liam: We are skipping past the fact that two men are dead right now.
Laura: (sighs)
Liam: Do we need to go and find them? And try to--
Laura: Do we need to go find these dead guys?
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: Are you sure they're dead?
Travis: I forgot where I left them.
Marisha: Grog--
Liam: This is upsetting.
Sam: I know where they are, but the situation was fluid, and it was fast-moving. And we acted on our best instincts and our best judgment, and mistakes were made.
Travis: Yeah. Mm-hm.
Marisha: Tary, it sounds like all of the opposite of that is true.
Sam: When you're an adventurer--
Laura: Except for mistakes.
Marisha: Except for the mistakes part, yeah.
Sam: When you're an adventurer, you have to learn to live with a certain amount of bloodshed around you, and I think what Greg has told me today--what he has taught me was to toughen me up. And I appreciate him for that and I appreciate the lesson. And I appreciate you all for sending me out with him, knowing full well that that would happen.
Laura: Don't kill people in cities! Don't kill people!
Sam: I still haven't-- I-- okay.
Laura: Don't kill people!
Travis: Who killed anybody?
Laura: Grog!
Marisha: Vax?
Laura: Did you--
Travis: What?
Laura: You didn't kill anyone, did you?
Liam: Of course he did, he looked us in the eye and he said he killed two people! We should go find them.
Travis: Yep. They're dead.
Laura: I don't believe him. Can I roll an insight check?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: Oh no.
Taliesin: Whose vomit was this?
Laura: Oh no!
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: (laughs)
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: I believe him!
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: I believe him so good! 11!
Taliesin: This game is a nightmare.
Matt: Grog fucking killed two people!
Laura: Oh my God! Grog!
Liam: That's it.
Travis: Look, I was trying to protect our new friend here. It had to be done.
Liam: Where was this place? Where was this place?
Laura: Ugh, we're never going to be able to come back to Vasselheim!
Liam: We have to find these two men and bring them to a temple or something, we can't just leave them--
Sam: It was a potion seller, it was a medicinal, herbalist or something--
Taliesin: Oh no.
Liam: Can you guide me there?
Marisha: Oh, you did not go to that guy, the guy who-- oh no.
Taliesin: Did you go to that guy?
Sam: It seems to be--
Travis: He did say he wanted to see the twins, especially.
Sam: That is not--
Liam: Look, listen, take me to this place. You and I will carry these men to a temple.
Sam: And do what? What they did to you?
Liam: We will-- what happened to me?
Sam: Well, you were revived, from death.
Liam: Well, I can't do that. And you can't do that, so we need to take these men to a temple where somebody can help them!
Travis: Oh, God, look, fine, they're not dead!
Laura: I don't believe you.
Travis: (sighs) No, I just knocked the life out of them, but they're not dead, right, wiretapping does not mean dead, all right? (all laugh)
Sam: It was in quotations.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Dead.
Travis: Dead.
Travis: Okay, look, they're fine, they might be covered in beer, we don't really need to go back for them.
Marisha: Insight check!
Laura: Yeah, I don't believe you. You killed them.
Marisha: Now you're the fucking boy who cried wolf three times.
Matt: Go for it. Roll insight, both you guys.
Marisha: God damn it, don't fuck me, Gil.
Laura: Oh, I rolled Gil, too!
Marisha: Oh, jeez, that wasn't great.
Laura: I got it. I got you covered.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Travis: They didn't ask you to roll, Taliesin.
Laura: 24!
Matt: No, you guys get at this point that Grog's been fucking with you.
Laura: You fucking dick!
Travis: Yep. (all laugh)
Laura: No, but seriously, you still attacked the guards, right?
Travis: He did.
Laura: That's still really bad.
Taliesin: Whose vomit is this?
Liam: So those guys aren't dead, is what you're saying? Those two guys are not dead?
Laura: They're not dead.
Travis: They're not dead.
Liam: All right, that's kind of funny.
Taliesin: I still feel like I would like an answer to the mystery of the vomit.
Laura: At least Doty was in disguise. No one will recognize him. Just take the disguise off him now.
Travis: That's what I said like five minutes ago.
Laura: Take the disguise off of him.
Marisha: That looks like Tary's vomit.
Taliesin: How can you tell?
Marisha: Because I saw him puke under the water and it floated right past me. I got a great view of it. He's a nervous puker.
Liam: What is better in this town? A disgusting mess or a robit?
Laura: A robit?
Liam: An automaton.
Laura: It's necromancy.
Liam: An ottoman.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: I think I need a drink.
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: What?
Laura: What?
Taliesin: I pour him a little bit of the Tear Whiskey.
Travis: How did you guys do?
Liam: Oh, great.
Laura: We thought we had a book.
Travis: But you don't?
Laura: But we didn't.
Liam: We left without the book, thinking we had the book, and then we lied about not having the book, but we actually didn't have it.
Marisha: But it seems like it might be okay, right?
Travis: Got that motherfucker.
Laura: Did you?
Marisha: Did you get it? Yeah! Real-life hero.
Matt: Two guards alive. That is fucking dead (all laugh)
Laura: I say we get Doty's disguise off of him.
Taliesin: All right.
Laura: I say we go to sleep.
Liam: I start peeling it away.
Sam: And then what?
Laura: Then we get up in the morning, and we pick up our pretty dresses.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: And we go get you crowned! So we can wear our pretty dresses.
Taliesin: Keep drinking.
Matt: Everything but the hair comes off. The mask, the porcelain, everything else comes off.
Laura: What about the cloak?
Matt: The cloak does not come off.
Laura: No!
Matt: Not from just tugging it. It's adhered pretty strongly.
Liam: This is so fucking terrible. I'm so angry. (all laugh)
Marisha: Tary, going forward, I think you need to recognize how literal Doty takes things, and maybe think maybe more detailedly on how you word things, maybe?
Sam: Doty did his job. He protected us.
Marisha: From innocent guards.
Sam: Who were going to arrest us.
Laura: Why were they going to arrest you?
Sam: Because we were arcanists walking loose in the--
Laura: It's not illegal!
Sam: I was led to believe it was. And I'm a stranger in this land, and they were trailing us, and your cohort over there, the big guy himself, told me that they were a danger to us, and Doty did his job. Listen, you can't blame Doty for the mistakes that I may have made. I take full responsibility for this, and I throw myself at your feet for mercy. I know I'm new to this team, and I hoped that this gift would be a peacemaking gesture. By the way, you should divide all these potions up as you see fit.
Laura: We totally should.
Sam: And I'm sorry if I made mistakes today. But we're all alive, we have what we need, and we're still on an adventure, right?
Taliesin: A toast to mistakes--
Sam: Let's all sing our fight song, shall we?
Taliesin: -- and to terrible consequences, to failure.
Laura: How about you go first, Tary.
Marisha: Yes, let's learn it from you.
Sam: Doty, show me what we wrote. (sings) 'Seven intrepid warriors we, were strong before and 'stronger with me. Drinking wine and Heroes' Feasts, saving maidens, defeating beasts. We 'fight, fight, fight, with strength and girth, I slew a marid and proved my worth. Vix and Vox, 'Kiko and Greg, and Percival with the head like an egg. I defeated a kraken too, and I saved the 'Ashari single-handedly in the ocean blue. We fight, fight, fight, with strength and girth. I 'won your hearts and I proved my worth.'
Taliesin: Ooh. Bravo!
Laura: Hey!
Sam: Now you all have fight songs too, don't you?
Taliesin: We'll cover that at the next drink. I think it's time to turn in.
Marisha: Hm, yes.
Laura: Wow.
Taliesin: I'm going to run-- I'm going to get a little bit of the hardest alcohol that they have, preferably a clear alcohol, and ask them if they have any chicken, like-- or some sort of meat that they're about to throw away.
Laura: Oh. Chicken.
Taliesin: Stop it.
Matt: They do have some near-spoiling meat. And at the cost of one gold piece you can get a pretty solid bottle.
Taliesin: I pop it and I'm just going to try and start solventing away the glue with grease, with fatty grease and alcohol.
Matt: It'll take you the better part of the next couple of hours, but you can do it.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm just going to try and get this thing off. Let me try and remove the hair too.
Matt: You do manage to get the hair off. You don't get all the glue splotches. Doty now has these, like, clusters of nasty-looking glue splotches all over the head. And of like, taken pieces of thread, and fuzz, and dirt and things just from the atmosphere to him. It looks awful. Doty looks awful. But the cloak does come off.
Taliesin: We'll have it cleaned, dear.
Laura: That's amazing. So worth it, darling, I can't believe you did that. Thank you.
Liam: Does the cloak of Elvenkind look like butt?
Laura: It's got clumps of red hair stuck.
Matt: Only like 10% butt. Like, there is still glue on it. You have to spend more time.
Liam: It worked?
Sam: Did we take off the mask?
Matt: If you want to.
Taliesin: It looks like the kindergarten class attacked it.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Should we take off the mask?
Laura: Probably.
Taliesin: Fucker.
Sam: There's another one! (all laugh)
Taliesin: There's another one! (all laugh)
Matt: It's like a hydra, Travis killed one, two more took its place.
Travis: It's so strange man, they go up, they come back down.
Taliesin: Arsehole, where did you go? Fuck. They're huge. Sorry. That was really inappropriate.
Matt: So, as you guys get tired, you could rent a room for the evening.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: At the tavern if you'd like, the Siren's Succor.
Laura: Okay, let's rent a room.
Matt: Okay. So, I'd say for the rooms for all of you guys tonight, drinking there, mark off ten gold, it's fine.
Sam: For everyone, or each.
Laura: For everyone.
Matt: For everyone.
Sam: Pf.
Taliesin: I know.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I can take care of this, if you'd like.
Taliesin: No, we got this. It's okay.
Laura: We've got it. It's fine, Tary.
Taliesin: But part of being--
Liam: You buy the potions, we pay for the shitty hotel rooms.
Sam: (laughs) I don't know if that evens out. But all right.
Taliesin: Don't think of it as a thing that evens out, think of it as an ever-increasing debt that doesn't really ever get paid.
Sam: I like the way you think, science bro.
Taliesin: Cheers.
Matt: All righty. As you guys rest for the evening, the morning comes around. You're across the board, fairly hung-over, but functional. Except for Grog, Grog, you're fine. Yay constitution 20! But you guys muster yourselves, get a quick bite to eat downstairs, in the now even-more-empty tavern. Your dresses are at the ready, you go and collect them. What's next, what do you guys want to do?
Laura: We should go to see your people.
Marisha: I mean, we could catch brunch first?
Laura: No. We should go to see. Your. People.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: No.
Marisha: All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go.
Liam: No time like the present.
Laura: Wait, what are the colors of Whitestone again?
Taliesin: Lavender, white, blue, gold, silver.
Laura: That's the colors I want my dress to be.
Travis: That's five.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: It's too late, it's black. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I might add, you do-- Part of taking a crest is that you actually do get to build something of your own.
Laura: We need to work on that, Percival.
Taliesin: We do. I was-- I feel like I've been negligent. That we've not been--
Laura: You also need to explain to me what the fucking Grey Hunt is at some point.
Taliesin: Yes, we should get to that. I only know because we've talked about that.
Matt: Yeah. All right.
Laura: Come on, let's go, Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. Let's go.
Laura: Antlers upon antlers.
Matt: All right. And such. With the Transport Via Plants spell cast into the nearest tree, you guys find yourself emerging from one of the cliffside trees that have grown out of the outcropping of stone and rock that marks the exterior of Zephra. Did you all travel here last time, or was it just Keyleth and Vax?
Marisha: It was just Vax and Allura--
Matt: Yeah, Vax. Allura, that's right.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Marisha: Whom we kind of forgot was with us. (nervous laugh)
Matt: That's right, and she was like, "Whatever."
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All right, so you guys all emerge, and you see now, on these extremely tall mountain bluffs, the wind is strong on the outskirts, and you can see, whizzing past you, puffs of cloud, and leaf, and dust. But it's all contained on the outside of this bluff. And before you on the opposite side, built deep into this mountain top, you can see dozens and dozens of structures made from the natural stone and bending of long wood slats that seem to have been curved over into these dome-like structures. You see small trees emerging in places, and even though you are a few hundred feet off, you can already see maybe 20 or so various people just wandering the town, some of which are outside working on-- sitting on benches, working on various crafts. You can see leathers being dried out from various hides. You catch the sight of a griffin that swoops past and disappears into a nearby cloud. And looking over the bluff--
Sam: Cool.
Matt: -- about ten feet off, this is the drop, goes down for hundreds of feet before vanishing into low-hanging clouds. You guys have no idea how high up you are, but it seems very high.
Marisha: (inhales) Oh man.
Sam: Are we falling?
Laura: Is it super windy?
Marisha: No no no, we're on the mountain.
Matt: You can see a lot of wind rushing just around you, but it seems like this portion of the mountain is almost protected, or at least the winds are guided in a way where they're not affecting this portion of the mountain.
Laura: So what do we do?
Liam: What happens now, boss?
Marisha: I forgot you guys haven't seen my hometown yet. Okay, all right. Let's go that way. Okay. See, over there is where I caught my first baby griffin--
Taliesin: Oh no.
Marisha: -- he was lost and got separated from his mom, and I captured him up, and I tucked him up under my shirt. And over there actually--
Taliesin: (groans)
Marisha: -- I tripped and fell and that was the first time that I scraped my knee--
Sam: Amazing.
Marisha: -- and I was like, oh no, I'm bleeding.
Sam: It must have been terrible.
Laura: While she was walking, I go behind and do this to Vax.
Marisha: Oh, it was so terrible, yeah.
Liam: Ow.
Laura: Does it still hurt?
Liam: No it's fine, I feel good. I feel really good.
Laura: Yeah?
Liam: Yeah, I feel really good. I feel rested. I feel fucking healthy man. I don't know. I'm serious.
Laura: All right, that's happy.
Liam: (growls)
Laura: (growls)
Matt: As you guys are walking closer to the outside of Zephra, you see a couple of individuals beginning to approach, three or four children, just seeing these strange visitors in the outskirts. They're also keeping low and not trying to draw your attention too strongly, though they are out in the middle of the open. You see a few bushes and elements. You see two grown individuals walking up with the children, one of which appears to be a relatively young girl, maybe around 13, 14 years old who pushes the kids to the back and goes, "Keyleth?"
Marisha: Yes, hi, hi. What's your name?
Matt: "Sora. You used to watch over me when I was little."
Marisha: Oh my goodness, Sora. Wow, last time I saw you, you were like, like, oh man. Look how big you've gotten.
Matt: "I--"
Marisha: Do you still know that handshake? Do you remember the--
Matt: It takes a moment for you guys to figure it out.
Marisha: And there, you've got it. You got it.
Matt: It's slightly awkward, but for the most part you recall it.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: "I'm much older now, I don't need to--"
Marisha: Oh man.
Matt: "I didn't--"
Marisha: You forgot--
Matt: "You're back."
Marisha: Yeah. I guess I am.
Matt: "We have to tell everyone else."
Marisha: Hey, hey.
Matt: The kids are all just quietly staring wide-eyed and smiling quietly.
Marisha: Sora, Sora. Have you seen my dad around?
Matt: "Do you want me to get him?"
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Okay."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "C'mon, c'mon kids." And takes them by the hand and they all drag the kids off as you guys wait in the outskirts of the city. One of the kids who didn't quite get a hand on this young three-year-old boy who's running behind them stops. Turns and stares at you all, but stares specifically at Grog and is just wide-eyed, going--
Travis: Hey.
Matt: "Hi."
Travis: Eat your vegetables, you'll look like this.
Matt: "Okay."
Travis: Now get out of here!
Matt: (yells) (all laugh)
Matt: Just immediately bolts past to catch up with the rest of the crowd.
Taliesin: So I believe you just set up a lifetime of unreasonable expectations.
Travis: He'll be healthy, though.
Laura: I've never seen Grog eat a single vegetable--
Travis: No, fuck those things.
Laura: -- the entire time I've known him.
Taliesin: I was wondering about that.
Travis: Nothing in green is good.
Matt: A short time passes. A few moments, before you begin to see the city suddenly come to more vibrant life. People are stepping out of their abodes. Dozens of individuals are beginning to come together, talking, whispering, and some looking back and watching you all in the outskirts of Zephra, until eventually it seems a procession of some kind is all gathering and moving out of this mass of people in your direction. As you look, you begin to see people adorned in similar clothing as to when you first encountered Keyleth in the swamps outside of Stillben. You see these leather-based, almost scaled-looking armor that drifts down to the legs. You see people that hold giant staffs that hold golds and greens and blue colors that mark the symbols of the Zephra tribe. And then, in the center of them, you've met once before, you see stepping forth, Korren, the father of Keyleth and the current acting Voice of Tempest of the Zephra. His long white, silver hair drifting behind him. He approaches with a look. Everyone holds back as he steps forth from the crowd and ignoring the rest of you, just goes and beelines straight to Keyleth. You can see him, he has a bit of a limp to him that you don't recall from last time, but he seems other than that in good health. As he approaches you, he clasps his hands out in front of him and takes a good long look at you as he reaches out and takes your hands into his own. "My daughter."
Marisha: I just drop to a knee and say, Kaitiyaki, father.
Matt: "Kaitiyaki, Keyleth. We've heard that the defense of Emon was successful, yes?"
Marisha: Yes, we have defeated the Chroma Conclave. The help of Vox Machina and many many others, at the cost of many lives.
Matt: "Good, good. I'm glad we could be of some aid to your journey."
Marisha: Yes, thank you. The Air Ashari were very valuable during that day. Very courageous.
Matt: "And we will remember those we lost in that fray. The great sacrifices that they gave so that these children could live. So?" And at this point, he now takes notice of the rest of the group. "By what joy do we have of bringing your allies here and returning to your people?"
Laura: He doesn't know.
Marisha: Sorry, I thought Uvenda might have said something. I'm here because I have completed my Aramente, and have come for my blessing.
Matt: "Yes, you have."
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: "I just wanted to hear it from your lips."
Marisha: Still waiting on your final word, I guess.
Matt: "Well, while we still have daylight, let us prepare for the ceremony. Come, come, all of you. You are welcome, welcome here in Zephra. We'll begin, decoration shall commence. Rest, prepare, naught but two or three hours until the ceremony is to occur." He turns, and folks begin to rush in, and people just begin to barrage you with questions and congratulations, and a number of individuals who seem to have heard stories, many second-hand, and exaggerations of the various things that you've accomplished over the past year or so here in Tal'Dorei. You answer questions, you play into the tall tales if you want. One child turns to you and goes, "And who are you?"
Sam: Taryon Darrington.
Matt: "I don't know who you are."
Sam: You will.
Matt: "You--" (all laugh)
Matt: There is a massive interest around Grog as goliaths generally do not travel this far up into the territory of the mountain. Most of them stay far north in the Cliffkeep or wandering the dividing plain. They're just swarming you and climbing up on you and hanging from your arms and you feel kind of awkward but kind of enjoying the attention at the same time.
Travis: They're really little.
Laura: Kind of like gnomes.
Travis: Yeah. (gasps) (all laugh)
Taliesin: Well that works, well done.
Travis: I'm good.
Matt: Immediately, over the next hour or two, people begin to gather floral wreaths and strips of silk and material that have been prepared specifically for these types of occasions. Many of them new, made from the recent generations in preparation, many that are held over by tradition and by the various leaders that came before you. Many that may have had the hope of the return of Vilya, but instead, carry through with memory of Keyleth. As this transpires, you guys are brought food, you are gathered into a central open celebration. Almost like a pit that descends about two feet, and there are a number of stools and tables, and food and drink are brought about. As opposed to an event and then a celebration afterward, it seems to be a reverse here at Zephra. It's a build-up. It's everyone, the excitement grows. As this is happening, you glance off and there is one very large, singular tree right across the way, at the very edge of the precipice of this rocky outcropping that holds most of the city of Zephra. And there at the edge you see one large, twisting, gnarled tree that curves upward. Not quite Sun Tree in height and size, but still very elegant and beautiful with long, thin branches that gently sway on the outskirts of whatever barrier seems to bend and twist the winds from coming and scattering the village. You watch as people step up to it, and they're leaving jewelry, they're putting large ribbons across it. Elements of it remind you of the tree that was in the center of the temple in Vesrah, though a different texture. It seems to be a deep, vibrant, healthy dark brown, and with elements of gray bark, with moss that grow at the base and tuck under the branches, where the shadows tend to linger throughout the day. Eventually, it seems that they have returned and the decor is set, benches have been moved, and most of the people of Zephra are now shifting in the direction of this tree.
Liam: In all the hubbub and the movement, a few moments before, I've been watching for Korren, and when I see him alone for a second, I make a beeline toward him.
Matt: He's in the process of a conversation. And it's interesting. During this whole thing, he was excited to see you and that you've come, but he's also-- he's kept a strange distance from you during this preparation. He smiles, and you guys meet eyes occasionally, but he's also just focusing on this endeavor, and then you kind of come out of the blue. "Ah, yes, Vax'ildan."
Liam: Forgive me. Might I have just a moment?
Matt: "Quickly. We're about to begin, but yes."
Liam: I will be brief. I just wanted to take a moment to say, I really wish you could've seen some of the things she has done. I know you are proud of her. I've never met anyone like her. She's going to do your people very proud. I'm grateful.
Matt: "As are we all."
Liam: You've a lot to do.
Matt: "As do you. As does she." And he reaches out and pats you on the head and ruffles your hair a little bit. And even that feels a little awkward for him, like he felt impulsive to do it, and then 'oh, that wasn't very-- mm.'
Liam: It's all right. It's more than I ever got.
Taliesin: Whoa. Ow.
Sam: Darkness.
Matt: "Anyway. Come. It's nearly time." And as all of you are led over, there are spaces at the very front of the ceremony, in the semicircle around this tree. There are platforms set up at the base of this tree now. Amongst these hundreds of various, dangling threads, these small pieces of paper that flitter on the outskirts of the gentle wind that pushes through. You guess they might contain wishes or passages or something, but you see bits of script written on them amongst the various glinting pieces of glass and gems and stone that have been polished. It's small, but beautiful. Eventually, you're led to sit in the center of this semi-circle, and as everyone gathers and takes their seat, you hear the occasional kid crying and people muttering to themself, and eventually everyone shushes as Korren, now wearing a very old ceremonial long light blue and white robe wearing what looks to be some sort of a somewhat tattered, like a scarf that's wrapped around his neck and drapes off each of his arms. It's thick and it's long and it almost touches the ground around him, but you can tell from the way he holds it, and his arms consistently rest at this crooked position that it has some symbolism to this ceremony. As he steps up under the tree and turns around everyone gets very quiet, and the wind seems to almost stop on the outside of this barrier. The rushing, perpetual gust of air seems to almost hold its breath for this. He clears his throat. And as he looks up to everyone, you swear this tree begins to slowly produce cherry blossoms as his words continue. "For long, we of the winds have awaited the procession of our tradition. With the passing of our elder voice, Dwala, it was my wife Vilya who was selected to take the Aramente. Beautiful and full of determination, she accepted her path. And while she did not return to us, the destiny she set is now seen as one of preparation. Her journey was not in vain, for it was her love that produced our daughter. It was her guidance in joy that taught our child compassion. It was her discipline and understanding that forged young Keyleth's spark of intuition and unlocked her adept connection with nature and the winds. We mourn the loss of our Vilya, but take pride that she lives on in the eyes of our own, returned, beloved woman of the winds. Here we bring together our collective voices to bless upon my daughter, the memory of Vilya, the champion of Guasar, the mantle of our destiny." And as he puts his arms up, from around you to each side, Keyleth, you watch as young acolytes begin to approach from each side, arms down. All seemingly carrying these various pieces of dark green, leather-like material. And as they come together, they latch them into place and slowly build this mantle. "Ring clear our voices to unite our breath and grant our strength to her guidance and wisdom, as Keyleth takes the rightful and earned responsibility of leading our people into this next generation." At this point, the assembled mantle is placed into Korren's arms. And you now see this beautiful neck and shoulder piece that rests past to the elbows, but limp and without body, in his hands. As he holds it there and the rest of the acolytes step back and find their place, seated, he lifts his arms up a bit and begins to just sing a singular note (sings). And everyone around you in Zephra begins to join in in this singular note. Do you choose to join in as well?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Sure.
Matt: As you do, the notes begin to separate and harmonize instinctually. It creates this symphony, this beautiful tangling of hundreds of voices from all across the spectrum. And what at first may seem to resemble a discordant hymn, finds this perfect spread of every note you've ever heard, musically merging as one. As he does this, instinctually, Keyleth, without even thinking, you rise and begin to walk towards him. Like the spirits of generations before you are lifting you by your shoulders and elbows, and bring you up before your father. You find the breath leave your lungs, the inside of your mouth is dry.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You're unable to understand what it is that's driving you, but before you know it you're standing before your father, looking up into his eyes as all of these voices just swirl around you, this weird warmth. The nerves in your stomach still climb to the top and vibrate within your chest. As your father places this mantle over your head and shoulders, and it comes to rest on you, heavier than you expected, but it fits well. As he places this, the green fades to a golden brown and red and orange and yellow. And the green leaves almost drip back into a long, springing trail of a cloak behind you that seems to grow with each passing surge of these voices around her, until it reaches the ground and curls behind. Eventually the cloak stops. The voices soften, and come to silence, as you look up once more into your father's face. "Rise, my daughter, and become Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest." He steps back and bows his head. Steps off the platform. And you stand and turn, and it's just you at the base of tree, looking about at all of Zephra before you, quiet, silent. And your friends before you, at the front of the crowd.
Marisha: Didn't think I'd make it here. I couldn't have done any of this without not only the support of every person in Zephra, and every person of the Ashari tribe, members of Emon, Tal'Dorei, Marquet, even Wildmount. In my journeys, I've learned being a leader is a global effort, one that takes the wisdom of many. Most importantly, I couldn't have done any of this without Vox Machina. And the pieces of them that I've taken away and have desperately tried to emulate in each one of them over the years. Each one of them with qualities that I admire and strive to embrace. Grog, with his strength and his unyielding loyalty. Vex, with her self-confidence and utter fearlessness. Vax is one of the most compassionate people I think I've ever come across and one of the most brave, even if it's maybe foolish. Percival, with your intelligence and your sensibility, is always there to be my balance. Scanlan, with his charisma and his wit. Pike--
Matt: As you glance past the group, you can see just the faint flutter of golden light and energy. Wherever she is, a part of her is watching.
Marisha: Pike, her generosity and her authenticity, always true to herself. And even Tary. Taryon Darrington, whose blind faith in Vox Machina and perseverance, trusted us even though he probably shouldn't have.
Sam: (whispers) You're incredible.
Marisha: All of these things that I learned and couldn't be a leader without. Vox Machina makes up me. Zephra makes up me. The Ashari people, and all of greater Exandria. I don't know if I'm the leader that you deserve, or a good leader, but I'm willing to dedicate the rest of my life to doing whatever I can for all of us. As long as Vox Machina stands by my side.
Matt: At this point, you watch as the light that remains of the eventually soon-to-come setting sun glints across the cheek of Keyleth, the bit of damp tear that has rolled down her cheek just detaches from the edge of her chin and hits the bottom of the stone. Every cherry blossom in the tree releases, and drifts past her from behind, before getting caught up in the wind just past her, causing this swirl of pinks and reds and whites behind her. Everyone around rises up, and they all begin to cheer and clap. All together. You look around and watch the rest of these blossoms slowly drift. You look and see your friends around you. You look around and you see your mother, out of the corner of your eye, just the memory of her. You sense that if she could be here, she would've been. Your father steps up and takes your hands and just says, "I'm so proud of you. And there's much to be done, I know, but I'm proud of you." And he takes your hand, and holds it up once more. "To the Voice of the Tempest. And the future of our people." Everyone cheers once more together.
Sam: To Vox Tempesta! (all laugh)
Matt: And with that, you gain the Inspiring Leader feat.
Marisha: What? I get the what now?
Matt: Inspiring Leader feat, as the end of your Aramente.
Travis: Oh, shit, Voice of the Tempest!
Matt: Which is pretty fun. What that allows you to do is--
Travis: You can never die.
Matt: No, you can totally die. You can spend ten minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their resolve to fight. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures, which can include yourself, within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Each creature can gain temporary hit points equal to your level plus your charisma modifier.
Marisha: Oh, what! Well, you guys are out of luck with the charisma modifier shit, but what! (all laugh)
Matt: And they can only gain the temporary hit points from this until they finish a short or long rest. So every short rest you can give everyone 17 temporary hit points.
Marisha: That is fucking dope!
Sam: You have to give a speech every time.
Matt: Essentially, you take ten minutes to talk everybody up. So start practicing.
Marisha: Jeez, no.
Matt: And we'll leave it there for the evening.
Laura: Oh, man.
Travis: That was gorgeous, man. That was gorgeous.
Laura: With the tree, man.
Matt: That was awesome. Completed your Aramente, took up the mantle, and, apparently, going to the Iron City of Dis soon. That's going to be fun.
Travis: (sings) We built this-- No, no more.
Laura: No more of Dis City.
Taliesin: I came up with great formal wear for you, too. It's a shame we didn't get a chance. I figured you out.
Travis: We'll see.
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: Grog has a very discerning taste.
Taliesin: I'm very proud I came up with an idea.
Laura: Well, I'm glad we went with the blue dress after that cape turned all the other colors of nature and it's like, you are covered.
Marisha: Yes. (all laugh)
Travis: Covered, girl.
Matt: Well done, guys. Thank you again, Loot Crate, for being our awesome sponsor.
All: Loot Crate!
Travis: Matt, you did a great job.
Matt: You guys are always such an absolute pleasure. Thank you for playing in my weird make-up world.
Taliesin: How long have you been working on that speech, man? That was nuts.
Matt: Oh, that was fun. I've been waiting for everybody to get to that moment.
Sam: Improv-ed it.
Matt: Glad you survived to get there.
Marisha: No shit.
Liam: Died in Stillben, game three.
Marisha: And send out the next one.
Matt: All right. We'll be back next week, to see where the next leg of Vox Machina's adventure takes them. Until then, have a wonderful night, have a wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet? Take care guys. (all cheer)

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: [no audio]
Matt: Where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. (laughter)
Matt: Why's everyone laughing? So yes! We're going to hop in here, but before we do, we have some quick announcements to get through. First and foremost, we have a survey that we put up a couple of weeks ago. It ends April 18th. If you happen to have an opportunity, please go ahead and put in your information, let us know where you're from, how much of the show you've watched, what kind of future things from Critical Role you'd like to see. It's us getting a feel for the size and spread of the community and it's very helpful and awesome. So you can check that out at geekandsundry.com/crsurvey. You'll probably see the link in chat as well, please do that if you haven't yet, that'd be awesome! You have until April 18th. As far as merch goes, we're still out of stock on dice, I believe?
Laura: No!
Matt: No?
Laura: There's officially 30 sets left, according to--
Sam: 30 sets?
Laura: 30 sets.
Liam: Sorry, they're gone. (laughter)
Laura: There are 30 sets left in the store, we will be ordering more. So there will be more, but I don't know when that's, you know, going to come in. So 30 sets for the time being.
Matt: Fantastic. Thank you Laura. Yes. Taliesin! Wednesday Club coming up, right?
Taliesin: There is a Wednesday Club. We're doing Comics 101, it's going to be our intro to how to read comics! The notion is like the show that you would show your grandmother, or your friend who's never apparently seen a written word next to a picture before. They do exist! I'm sadly not going to be there, but Amy and Matt are going to throw together something really, really awesome, and I'm going to be helping out from the sidelines, throwing them stuff, because I'm going to be out of town. But yay.
Matt: Awesome. Speaking of Taliesin and a different Matt, we're both going to be on Eric's TBD RPG tomorrow at noon Pacific time.
Sam: Oh. The dice are gone.
Matt: The dice are gone.
Noelle: Just now.
Matt: Well done. Jesus.
Laura: Good job, guys that got them!
Matt: Yay! We'll have more soon! But we'll both be on Eric's TBD RPG tomorrow at noon, here at Geek and Sundry, Pacific time for the Doctor Who RPG. I'll be returning as my character Meatstick, the--
Travis: Meatstick?
Matt: Meatstick, yeah. He's a heavily experimented-on Ood who is massively buff and looks kind of like Nemesis from Resident Evil 3. But with more of a tentacle mouth. So that'll be fun!
Taliesin: Yes! I'll be doing my old man voice. It's very fun, yes.
Matt: I know it is, and I believe Darin De Paul will be joining us as well.
Taliesin: I think he's a maybe.
Matt: Maybe? He's supposed to be. I think he might be a little late. I'll check in.
Marisha: I think he's going to be on. I think. Pretty sure.
Matt: Mystery! Abound! Marisha! New Signal Boost, went up this week?
Marisha: Yes! It's... me! (laughter)
Matt: Full circle!
Marisha: Again! I'm back! Go watch-- actually, we're going to be playing it over the course of the break. So that we have a break.
Matt: You should watch it.
Marisha: So you'll watch it over the course of the break.
Matt: It's only getting weirder, folks.
Marisha: It's getting really weird. You can tell it's such an outlet for us of the creative team. It's got a lot of meta things going on, reflecting our day-to-day lives. It always has been. It's great.
Matt: I will be at Sakura-Con by the way, next weekend. April 14th through the 16th up in Seattle. Be doing some panels, signings, and fun stuff, so if you guys are up in the Seattle area next weekend, come say hi! It'll be fun. Sorry, pardon my belch. Snuck up on me. And once again, Will Friedle is going to be at the Wales Comic Con, April 8th and 9th. Real soon. So if you're near Wales, go say hi to Will, give him a bunch of really large presents that he can't bring back on the plane, they will become his problem. So, that's my recommendation. Fuck that guy, exactly. And a reminder: me, Taliesin, and Marisha will be guests at Momocon, May 25th to the 28th in Atlanta, Georgia! So if you're in that area, other side of the country, come say hi then! Because that'd be fun.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: And Talks Machina, of course, every Tuesday, at 7PM Pacific here on Twitch and Alpha, where we talk about-- next week, we'll be talking about this episode! And the episode before that a little bit, probably, too.
Marisha: Yeah. I hope everyone liked the panel, by the way.
Matt: The panel went great! We had a great turnout at WonderCon!
Marisha: Yeah, thanks everybody who came!
Taliesin: It was super cool.
Matt: Like we kind of filled the arena. I had this big fear we were going to get up on stage and it was going to be, like, seven people in the front row and just empty space.
Marisha: Apparently 2,800.
Sam: Oh wow!
Marisha: 2,800 strong.
Matt: Jesus.
Laura: You Critters!
Marisha: Yeah, so many Critters.
Matt: So thanks for coming, guys!
Liam: Great costumes, lots of cosplay.
Travis: Oh, Brian Wayne Foster also said the Wondercon panel will be on G&S's YouTube Friday at 8PM, in case you missed it on Talks Machina.
Matt: Great, so you can check it out then. And I believe, unless I'm mistaken, that's it. Anything else anyone wants to talk about? Noelle, anything you want to talk about?
Noelle: I had a great day today--
Matt: Awesome!
Noelle: -- and it was really fun. I had a good lunch.
Matt: I'm so glad. What'd you have?
Noelle: Falafel.
Matt: Nice, good choice.
Liam: Hey look, this is a book that she made, and it's so good! And she signed it for me and I'm reading it to my kids and they love it!
Noelle: There's a bear in it.
Laura: There is a bear in it!
Noelle: More than that in it, too, let me tell you. Just getting started. Lots of different animals. (laughter)
Matt: Which, by the way, thank you again, Noelle, for coming and playing this again this week.
Noelle: Yeah, hey, is anyone tied to a table and needs help right now? Because apparently I'm available now. I'm here to help. (laughter)
Matt: And, on that note, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. Just so you guys know, we know there is a bit of an audio-sync issue that's happening right now. It's apparently not on our end; our systems are syncing just fine. It might be a Twitch-side thing. Hopefully they're working on it right now and seeing if we can figure out how to get that fixed. In the meantime, my apologies. We will continue playing, and at the very least the upload will be synced. So keep an ear out. Thank you for your patience. Technical! All righty, so. Catching us up from last week. Vox Machina goes to hell. In tying up loose ends and dealing with lingering business, you've decided to travel to the Nine Hells of Baator, specifically the second layer of Dis, to where the iron city of Dis, under the rule of Dispater, to seek out the place where Hotis, the rakshasa, which is now in a chain of perpetually hunting members of your team. You decided it was best to end it there, as the only way to kill the entity is to destroy it on its own home plane. So you gathered yourselves, you transported via Keyleth onto the second layer of hell, you wandered incognito as various demonic-adjacent entities. You've avoided a modicum of interest or other issues, you've made friends and signed a contract for aid with a cambion owner of some sort of tavern in the vicinity, you met with a silly shop owner, you ate soul crystals, little soul stones, and you've agreed to, for safe passage into the subterranean prison of Mentiri, which apparently houses Hotis as he's reforming, you've come to discover, you will go and assassinate a pit fiend named Utugash, who is the superior of the individual you signed the contract with. And upon his destruction, and without leaking any information that could tie this individual to the assassination, be granted passage safely and unspoiled into the prison to seek out your quarry, slay it, and return home safely. As you snuck into the home of this pit fiend, you quickly discovered a dwarvish female had endured quite some torture and was found chained to a table. You released her, and she introduced herself as Tova. Actually, I don't believe you ever introduced yourself. You didn't give a name? Did you?
Noelle: It's in there somewhere.
Matt: I'm sure it was somewhere in there.
Laura: Yeah, she said her name!
Matt: I think you did. Okay, good. Little else, though.
Laura: I wrote it down.
Marisha: I know. That means it happened!
Matt: There you go. That was awesome.
Laura: I also wrote down "chain devils know." I don't know what that note meant.
Noelle: Oh my god, what do they know?
Travis: You were tripping last session.
Marisha: Because the chain devil potentially knew--
Laura: About the Bastion of Flesh, is that what it was?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Well, there you go.
Laura: It was just, chain devils know, period.
Noelle: Very broody.
Matt: Chain devils, period  no. N-O. Period. Just don't.
Laura: That, too.
Matt: However, your new dwarven friend transformed into some sort of a lycanthrope werebear, taking a greatsword from Grog's stash in the bag of holding. You gave chase over one of the guardians and keepers of the stronghold, killed it, and in doing so alerted other members of the stronghold, killed them, and in doing so alerted other members of the stronghold, and Grog, creeping forward down this hallway, revealed a central chamber where betwixt two pools of what appear to be molten, glowing blood, and sitting upon a throne, the corpulent, grotesque, sweaty, slick pit fiend named Utugash sits there. The terrible toothy grin, who speaks telepathically into your mind. "So. What do you bring to me to pleasure?" And I need you all to roll initiative.
Laura: Oh god! That quickly, huh?
Travis: Telepathically?
Matt: Yeah, just like the last one spoke to you.
Travis: Are people just too lazy to use their mouths?
Taliesin: Mouths are for eating, not for talking.
Marisha: It's like texting in hell.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. All righty, folks. So, given that point. 25 to 20?
Liam: 24.
Laura: 24.
Travis: Whatever.
Matt: 20 to 15. Who has what?
Sam: 19.
Taliesin: 15.
Noelle: 16.
Travis: Samesies.
Noelle: Oh, we're going together. Yeah!
Marisha: 17.
Sam: Wow, we all did pretty well.
Marisha: Yeah we did, for us.
Laura: What'd you roll?
Sam: We're all between 15 and 24.
Matt: All right, so, as the pit fiend's still just standing there, its arm hanging over the edge of this giant axe it's using, propping it, it stares at Grog. It seems to be completely lazy, confident, and doesn't feel threatened whatsoever by the presence of this goliath that has stepped into its visual range. However, top of the round, Vax and Vex. What do you guys want to do?
Liam: Take it.
Laura: No, you go.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: So you guys are right there.
Liam: Clicking the Boots of Haste. I'm going to now-- I know that there's a clot of people, but I have a lot of movement now, so I'm going to slide back towards Grog? No, towards Tova. That's a big bear at the other entrance. Towards the other entrance. Oh, that's a wall.
Laura: There's no other entrance.
Matt: The only entrance you know of is this one right there.
Laura: We really should have gone up and looked at it up close before.
Matt: That's okay. Now you know.
Liam: Then I'm going to slide along the wall up to where Grog is.
Matt: Okay. You move along on this side?
Liam: Yeah. Am I within range of oily guy? What's the distance, though, ten feet?
Matt: The distance between you and Utugash would be 25 feet.
Liam: 25 feet. All right.
Laura: Kill him!
Liam: Little test run. Let's dagger, dagger, dagger.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Okay. Because I don't know if he's really there or not. First one is 33.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Yeah, good. That's 12, plus eight, nine--
Laura: I was just thinking because it's at the same time, technically our moves. Could I send Trinket in?
Matt: Trinket into the room? Or just into the hallway?
Laura: Well, that way Trinket's next to him so that my brother gets better-- doesn't he get better--
Matt: Trinket, from here, would be five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. Trinket has a speed of 40, right?
Travis: I think that's right.
Laura: I think so, yeah. Could he get there?
Matt: Trinket can get there.
Laura: Oh god, that is so scary! I don't know, now that I'm saying it, if that's the way to go.
Travis: Go with your instincts.
Laura: Here's my question.
Sam: We have a backup bear. (laughter)
Laura: While he's figuring out his shit, if Trinket falls and I don't see him, does he still come into Raven's Slumber if it's within 100 feet? Or do I have to have visual?
Matt: You don't know.
Laura: (gasps) Matthew Mercer!
Travis: You know, there is really one way to find out.
Matt: No, as long as the enchantment's in the radius, it's fine. (laughter)
Laura: Then he's going to do that so that you have a better attack on him.
Liam: Well, I'm going first, so I've got the goods already.
Laura: Motherfuck. Whatever.
Matt: You rush in, you get there.
Liam: First blade goes, and I'm going to Smite him.
Matt: Are you waiting for Trinket to get there before you throw?
Liam: No, I'm not. I went already.
Matt: All right. Go for your attacks.
Travis: But you could, he's saying you could have your advantage on that.
Liam: I have it because I'm going before. Because I'm smiting him, first hit's for 55 total.
Matt: 55 points of damage. Slick.
Liam: That's the first. The second is a 20 to hit. And the third is a 27 to hit.
Matt: All three hit.
Liam: The next one, I will try--
Noelle: What could possibly go wrong?
Laura: Just keep saying that!
Liam: So he has to save against a DC 15 for poison on the second attack.
Matt: No, it doesn't. He's immune.
Liam: Yeah, I figured I'd try. The next is nine, plus psychic damage, damn it, 12. So a total of 14, just for those two attacks. And then I will use some more movement to move past Grog, still in the hole, pressed against the outside of the door, out of his sight.
Matt: Okay. So you're now hiding against this side of the wall there. As Trinket runs in into the center of the area, as Trinket rushes in and rushes up to the side of the pit fiend, what are you doing?
Laura: I'm going to back up next to Tova. Wait, who's the big guy? What's that big thing? Is that Doty?
Matt: That's Doty.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to get closer to Doty, and I'm going to hold my attack until I have visual. And then I'm going to have Trinket attack him, since I don't have visual on him right now, as my bonus move. So he's just going to get one attack.
Matt: All right, let me check one thing real fast on beastmaster. You are technically taking the attack action yourself. I'll allow it.
Laura: You said I can get my attacks and then have Trinket be my bonus action, because he can do one attack as my bonus action. Single attack on bonus for bestial fury.
Matt: That's true. Yeah. I'll allow it. How it usually works is your action is the attack, and then as a bonus action you can give it, it's like you're both attacking at the same time. You're holding your action, but it is still an attack action, so I'll allow it. Go ahead and use it. It's fine.
Laura: All right. He's going to just be in there, roaring. Get them, Trink! He's going to roll a 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Laura: Yay! Whoa! That's a 15!
Matt: Awesome. Are Trinket's attacks magical?
Laura: Well, he's a really magically charismatic masseuse--
Matt: So Trinket gets an attack, scrapes the claw, gets up there as it runs into the room, the claw strikes, slashes across the front of the belly of the giant red pit fiend. It doesn't do as much damage as you hoped it would.
Laura: Does it do any damage?
Matt: It does some damage, but not as much as you'd hoped. All righty. That ends your turn. You're holding your action until you have visual on the pit fiend. Taryon, what are you doing?
Sam: It's rather stuffy in here, so we should open a window. I'll run up to right in front of Vex and slap a window on the wall.
Matt: Okay!
Noelle: Did you run out of doors?
Sam: I've run out of doors. (laughter)
Sam: I came with one. But I have two windows!
Matt: So for the purposes of this, this is now a window here.
Marisha: Does it have nice Roman-style shade and then little baskets?
Matt: Yeah, no. It's beautifully carved. Yeah, it was like some Italian architects designed this beautiful--
Sam: It's a casement window, so I have to go-- (squeaking) (laughter)
Matt: Perfect. So, to Taryon. Use your action to rush forward, you rip off the patch, slam the patch on the side, and you watch as the stone suddenly crumbles to dust in that space. Window is now open in the side of that wall. As soon as that happens--
Laura: I attack.
Matt: Vex, go make your attack.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Two against the pit fiend.
Laura: Two against-- I want to do Bramble Shot as my first attack.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Okay. Oh! 30.
Matt: 30 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Okay. So I get Sneak Attack because Trinket's next to him!
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Okay. 4d8. Seven plus ten is 17. 17 just for that brambleness. And then he has to roll a strength saving throw of DC 17.
Matt: That's cocked. Yeah, rolled a 20.
Laura: Okay. 15. 17 plus three is 20. Three lightning damage of that and then Sneak Attack is another six.
Matt: Nice. All righty.
Laura: So that's the first attack.
Matt: Go for it. Second attack?
Laura: Second attack! What was that? 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Laura: All right! What's five plus eight? Is that 13?
Noelle: Yes.
Laura: 13.
Noelle: Why are you asking me? I'm a bear. Notoriously bad at math.
Liam: Moneybags, what the hell?
Laura: 15 with two lightning damage. 16, 17.
Matt: All righty. So both arrows fire off. You watch as the one slams into the side of Utugash and the vines wrap around. Utugash brings one arm up, tears them off of his body, picks up the axe and hefts it over the shoulder looking back at where the window now exists where once there was none. Looks over and sees you and Taryon through the window.
Laura: Am I allowed to move back at all, or duck under the window?
Matt: You could attempt to make a hide, but he was looking directly at you. You can move on inside.
Laura: Well, I probably can't hide; isn't that a bonus action?
Matt: Yeah, you already used bonus action.
Laura: So if I just move out of the way.
Matt: So yeah, you can move out of the way if you want.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: This way or this way?
Laura: Towards Doty.
Matt: Towards Doty? Okay, so you're going to move on the other side of Doty. That's going to be your movement, there.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Okay. Cool. That is going to bring us to Taryon. Did you want to do anything with Doty?
Sam: Well, he can't fit through a window. (laughs)
Matt: How big's the window in size?
Sam: It's two feet by four feet, I believe?
Matt: He could pull through, but it's going to take half his movement to do so.
Sam: I'll just say, Doty! Go back up Grog!
Matt: And Doty runs this way. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. Doty gets right there, just crammed through the hallway and squeezed through. And that's going to be where Doty stays. All right, that ends your turn. All right, at this point now, Utugash puts one hand up and gives some sort of a marker in the air. You're not quite sure what the meaning is or what it's doing. You're the only one who really sees it, Taryon.
Travis: I can't see it?
Matt: Well, you see it too, Grog, actually.
Travis: I totally know he was (sings) dancing, dancing, dancing!
Sam: I don't have any idea?
Matt: You don't, actually. He just goes like--
Sam: Oh. Semaphore.
Matt: That's it. All right, Keyleth. Then Tova and Grog, you're on deck, so--
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to scooch Vex over, be like, sorry, excuse me! I just want to-- And into the window? And I want to do--
Laura: I'm not next to the window anymore.
Matt: Taryon is. You moosh past Taryon.
Marisha: Oh, sorry. Excuse me, Tary. Blight!
Matt: Blight? Okay.
All: Blight.
Marisha: Bees?
Matt: Range on Blight is 60 feet, right?
Marisha: 30.
Matt: 30 feet?
Marisha: Am I within 30 feet?
Matt: You're going to have to get closer.
Sam: Each one of those squares in the room with him are ten feet squares, right?
Matt: Each square is five feet. It's five, ten, 15--
Sam: The big squares are ten, yeah.
Matt: Yeah, the big squares are ten.
Liam: It's hard to see the smaller ones.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: So you'd have go through the window to do it.
Sam: (sings) Come to my window!
Matt: (sing) Come inside.
Laura: (sing) Come inside.
Marisha: Yeah, sure, I'll go through the window.
Matt: Okay, so you step through, you get about there. You have ten feet more movement. So that'll do it. All right, so.
Marisha: Can I Blight and then back out? Back through the window?
Matt: You're not going to have enough movement. You'll get up into the window. You won't get all the way through.
Marisha: (grunts) Shit!
Matt: That is a 21. What's your DC?
Marisha: Fuck! Are you serious? 20.
Matt: Yeah, so takes half damage. Go ahead and roll damage.
Sam: Wait, he took damage, though!
Marisha: Only half damage.
Sam: Because he's immune to magic or something? Is that what's going on?
Matt: No, you learned as the last battle, that pit fiends, as do most devils, have magic resistance. They have advantage on saving throws against spells. You figured this information when you researched.
Laura: And only magical weapons can damage them, or they have resist on non-magical weapons?
Matt: They seem to have resistance from non-magical weapons, from the research you've done, yeah.
Laura: Based on my lack of Trinket attack fullness.
Marisha: 32 total? And yeah, am I able to like barrel roll, like through the window?
Matt: You get up partway through the window, and that's the extent of where you go.
Marisha: Hang on! Wait! (laughter)
Laura: I'd like to think one of your antlers caught, and you're like, (yelps).
Marisha: Not like this! (laughter)
Matt: All righty. Tova. Grog.
Noelle: Oh boy!
Travis: Bears first.
Noelle: Okay, so how far would I have to run to get into the front door?
Matt: To get over here?
Noelle: Yeah.
Matt: That would be 30. 35 feet would get you right at the front door, there.
Noelle: So if I drag Keyleth out of the window, could I go through the window? Am I too big?
Matt: You could go through the window. You'd lose about ten feet of your movement, but you'd be able to get through it. You'd probably push her out of it.
Noelle: I push her. Can I pull her? (laughs) I have to push her back in and then go through?
Marisha: I'm like the golden retriever with the stick.
Matt: If you carry her through, that's going to use part of your actions this turn. Or you could just barrel through and push her out. What're you going to do?
Noelle: All right, so, I can go 45 feet.
Matt: Yeah.
Noelle: So if I just bear-barrel through, how close could I get to this guy?
Matt: You can get right up next to him.
Noelle: All right, I'm going to do that. I'm going to go for it.
Matt: You rush over and go right past, now bear and bear, side by side. Keyleth, you get knocked out of the window, prone. All of a sudden this giant werebear (impact noise) just shoulder checks you and you go flying out, landing on your face, on the heated stone. (sizzling noise) Ah!
Sam: Oh! It's okay.
Noelle: Sorry!
Marisha: It's fine, I needed a tan! I was getting a little pasty.
Matt: Take three points of fire damage. (groaning)
Noelle: God! I would feel worse if your shopping trip hadn't gotten me so much more tortured yesterday than it should have. I don't feel that bad. I'm going to be honest.
Marisha: You legit shouldn't.
Noelle: So now I'm in, is there any way I could get on the other side of him from Trinket?
Matt: Currently, no. Your full movement gets you right up next to the pit fiend.
Noelle: Damn. This is a bad plan. All right. Well, I'm just going to hit him with my--
Matt: You have a bonus action, too.
Noelle: Are my claws only magical when I'm doing the thing?
Matt: Your claws are magical in general.
Noelle: I'm just going to hit him with my claws, then.
Matt: Okay.
Noelle: All right.
Matt: So you take the sword and chuck it aside for a second, and bring out your bear claws and you're going to go for a double strike?
Noelle: 19?
Matt: A 19 to hit?
Noelle: Yep.
Matt: 19 misses, unfortunately.
Noelle: Goddamn it. And 25.
Matt: 25 does. The first strike goes (scraping sound), scrapes across the front of the belly of the pit fiend. No damage sustained, chuckles deeply. You back up with another strike.
Noelle: All right. So that's a 14.
Matt: 14 damage?
Noelle: Yeah, I guess so.
Matt: All righty. And you can use your bonus action to attack a third time if you want to.
Noelle: Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Curse of Mutual Suffering. And I'm going to amplify that. So I'm going to-- wait.
Sam: What're these words?
Noelle: I'm super special. It's about to get extra in here. So if I do a blood curse and I take damage, does that mean that my werewolf state gets agitated? If it's self-inflicted?
Matt: If it's self-inflicted, no.
Noelle: Okay, all right. I'm going to amplify it. So that means I take 14.
Matt: All righty. So go ahead and roll your Crimson Rite die, which I think is a d8. So you just roll a d8 and you take that much damage.
Noelle: Oh. Right. I thought that it was my other one, so that's fine. That's great. I took one point of damage.
Matt: There you go. So you take one point of damage, and, as far as the Mutual Suffering-- All right, there you go. So. You watch as you rush up to it, you slash it twice with your claws, and as you pick up your sword, you put one hand up, and as you close your fist, you watch as blood pools in the center of your palm and drips out the corners of your fingers. As it does, you watch the veins on the outside of Utugash's stomach pulse for a second, and his chuckle goes (groans), like he got a tummy ache. All right, that ends your turn.
Noelle: Told you I was going to going to be extra.
Liam: The bear musk over here is palpable. (laughter)
Matt: So that finishes Tova turn. Grog.
Travis: Ah! I want to get in on the melee party. May I run up to his opposite side?
Matt: Certainly.
Travis: Just where his right arm is. Just so he's got escorts on each end. May I smash together my Titanstone Knuckles?
Matt: You may.
Travis: It's like the Autobots.
Laura: Yeah, it was good!
Liam: (sings) You got the touch--
Marisha: (sings) You got the power!
Liam: (sings) You got the power!
Matt: You transform into your larger self.
Travis: What's up, bitch? May I make two reckless attacks?
Matt: You may.
Travis: Thank you. That's a 30.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 19. Nice. That is 36.
Matt: 36?
Travis: No, that can't be. 33.
Matt: 33. Damage?
Travis: No, I did the second hit.
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage for each.
Travis: 18 for the first one. These are two-handed, by the way. 22 for the second one.
Matt: Nice! So 40 points of damage on the two strikes. As you rush up, almost diving into the pool, you skirt off to the side, slam the Titanstone Gauntlets together and grow to your larger size. Swirling the axe in the air, you go (whoosh), and the second strike in a big X formation across the side of it. You see it gashing across the arm and the upper muscles of the shoulder, and you see his fingers grip the axe with more anger and frustration.
Travis: Oh, and this is the Thrower. It's still the Dwarven Thrower, though, the hammer.
Matt: Right, right, the hammer, okay.
Travis: Can I use my bonus action to go into a frenzied rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: Thanks. And I don't get to attack.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: What color is pit fiend blood?
Matt: It's a dark, dark blackish-purple. All righty, that ends Grog and Tova's turn. Percival.
Taliesin: That's looking really crowded over there. I'm going to wander over to that first prison cell and take a look inside that door.
Laura: (gasps) Percival!
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Marisha: Percival. (laughs)
Laura: I'm standing in the corner looking at him like, (whispers) what are you fucking doing?
Taliesin: Yeah, a lot. 27.
Matt: You glance inside, and you can see what appear to be piles of goods: small chests, boxes, crates. It looks like various things that have been collected and just shoved in this corner and locked up. There is a lock on this door.
Taliesin: Okay. How's my visual on that guy through the window?
Matt: Through here?
Taliesin: And I ignore anything other than full cover. I ignore three-quarter cover.
Matt: Yeah, you have visual.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to take my first shot at that lock.
Matt: You don't have a bonus action, we'll say, because you moved up and just glanced inside.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's fine.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'll take my first shot with the Pepperbox at that lock.
Matt: The lock? Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's 27.
Matt: 27? Okay, go ahead and roll damage on the lock.
Taliesin: Obviously it doesn't take psychic damage. That's 16 points of damage.
Matt: 16 points of damage? The lock blasts off, and leaves hanging a small piece of twisted, turned metal that once was the top of it. The door is now unlocked and open.
Taliesin: Cool. I'm going to turn and take my last two shots at Orthax. I've got a plan.
Matt: Utugash.
Taliesin: I've got an Orthax plan, never mind. I've just given the game away!
Noelle: Yelling out the wrong name in bed, eh? (laughter)
Marisha: Are you having PTSD flashbacks, Percival? Are you okay?
Taliesin: Oh man! I'm too tired. I'm going to mess up my plan! This is so bad.
Liam: I'm totally into you, (stammering) Utugash.
Taliesin: First shot, I'm going to take the Animus, and I'm going to try for a trick shot, for an arm shot. One for Grit, and just for safety's sake-- no, that's all. That's a 31 to hit.
Matt: 31 hits.
Taliesin: And that's ten, plus eight, plus 1d6 psychic. Plus I'm going to burn eight points of Cabal's Ruin, which empties Cabal's Ruin.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So that's going to be 14 points of damage, plus one point of psychic damage, plus--
Matt: 8d6 lightning.
Sam: Oh, shnikes!
Matt: Cabal's Ruin, man. Vestiges (singsong) at your disposal!
Taliesin: Five, six. Yeah, I'll take a seven and an eight, I'll give these back to you. (continues counting) 23 points, does that seem right?
Matt: 23 points, okay.
Taliesin: 23 points of lightning damage. And also he has to do a strength check or drop the axe.
Matt: It's a 29.
Taliesin: He makes that strength check! (laughter)
Matt: He had a natural 19.
Taliesin: And, just for fun, I'll take one more shot.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: That's 31 to hit, that hits. Nothing fancy on this one, obviously, just the old-fashioned-- 16 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay, nice.
Taliesin: And then I'm going to use the rest of my turn to, if possible, open that door and get behind it for cover, of that room.
Matt: Okay, because you blew the lock off and the door's somewhat ajar, we'll say you move it open and get partially inside, that's as far as you can get.
Taliesin: I just want to use it for cover.
Matt: All right, so you get behind the door, and you're ducking in the side there. Perfect. Okay. At the end of your turn, Utugash is going to use a legendary action to attack you.
Noelle: Bring it.
Sam: Ursa Major.
Noelle: That's my wrestling name.
Matt: That is going to be a 16 to hit. I think that hits you because you have no armor on.
Noelle: It hits. Yeah, I don't have no armor on.
Matt: So, as the giant axe swings towards you, that's going to be 23 points of slashing damage with the axe. However, that does trigger the Mutual Suffering, so he takes 23 points of necrotic damage from the impact. As the axe swings and cuts across your bear chest, all of sudden, where the blood bulged earlier, you watch a secondary wound open simultaneously where no weapon was apparently visible and blood begins to just trickle out. Devil blood.
Travis: Teach me.
Laura: That. Was. Sick.
Matt: And he's going to use, as part of his last legendary action, and does another maneuver with his finger like that.
Taliesin: He did another thing.
Laura: He did another gesture? What gesture? What did he do?
Noelle: Oh, fuck!
Travis: Same thing.
Matt: He did this.
Liam: Gang sign, gang sign.
Laura: Oh no, people are watching.
Sam: Was it this thing?
Matt: So, at the top of the round-- The only people in the room right now, Keyleth is face-first on the ground. I need Tova and Grog to make perception checks, if you could.
Laura: What about Trinket? Trinket's got a really good sense of smell.
Matt: Have Trinket roll a perception check.
Noelle: 17.
Travis: Two!
Laura: Wait, with his keen sense of smell-- Okay. 17 plus-- what does he add to it? Anything?
Matt: Whatever his perception bonus is.
Laura: Oh, wow! 17 plus nine. 26!
Matt: Trinket doesn't know why, but he's like (sniffs). And you watch Trinket looking around the room. The pit fiend is not alone. You don't know where anything else is, but while the room appears to be empty, Trinket is picking up other scents in the room.
Noelle: Can I talk to Trinket? Can I understand Trinket?
Matt: (laughs) Sure.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: Why not? Your bear form, you speak bear
Laura: Yes! Ah, I love this!
Liam: Everybody buckle up.
Matt: "There's something here!" (laughter)
Matt: (sniffs) "Two! Small."
Noelle: There's two! Small!
Travis: Why do you sound like a bear?
Matt: You hear the sound of grinding stone. You don't see anything. Unfortunately, the low light in here, and your not great perception, you don't pick out any visual, other than-- a familiar sound to you, Grog-- as something in the ceiling opens up, and suddenly searing hot oil comes spilling from the ceiling, down onto both you, Trinket, and Tova. I need you to make dexterity saves, Tova, Trinket, and Grog.
Laura: Don't fuck me Gil. Oh, Gil. Did he get an advantage, though, because he sniffed out people?
Matt: Nope!
Laura: Damn it.
Travis: Should've gone with Gil.
Matt: Three.
Travis: Seven.
Laura: Nine.
Matt: All right, that is 21 points of fire damage to Trinket, Tova, and Grog.
Laura: 29?
Matt: 21 points of fire damage.
Sam: Does he take 21 points of fire damage?
Travis: I am resistant to fire.
Matt: Devils have a strange thing called immunity to fire damage.
Sam: Immunity? Not just resistance, immunity?
Matt: They're devils, man.
Travis: So I'm resistant to fire, but this is boiling oil, does that count?
Matt: It's considered fire damage because it's the heat that does it, so you take half of that. Put you at ten. So as that's happening, as the oil splashes down, you guys are tensing from the impact. Vax, you peer around the corner and you hear (creaking), and you look to the other side just as the portcullis has been lifted, and you see coming out of the opposite side the chamber is one of the bone devils that you've seen wandering in the street and is pouring from the other side. Its claws come through. It's as wide as the hallway, its jaw unhinges, its tongue slathering, these small flapping insect-like wings across the back of its scapula, its claws reach out towards you.
Liam: The rest of the party hears  ermagerd, ermagerd, ermagerd!
Laura: Did you already ask if the pit fiend took damage because you took damage?
Noelle: Oh, did he take damage from me? Was my curse still in effect?
Matt: Once he takes the damage, the curse is up. It's just for one hit.
Noelle: Sorry. I tried my best.
Matt: But he took 23 free damage, which is nice. Vax, he's going to take three attacks on you. That is a 27.
Liam: Yeah, that kind of hits.
Matt: All right, that is a 20.
Liam: That does not hit.
Matt: And with the tail, that is a 24.
Liam: That also hits. I will use Uncanny Dodge for the tail.
Matt: Okay. So the first claw hits you, you take 11 points of slashing damage, and as the first claw strikes you across the chest, the second one, you manage to duck right out of the way, it slams into the stonework, and as you glance up, you try and dodge and roll out of the way as the tail scrapes you across the back. That is 18 points of piercing damage, reduced to six, and you would have the possibility of becoming poisoned; however, you guys are still under the effect of Heroes' Feast, so that does not affect you.
Noelle: So his tail's poisoned?
Matt: Now it is Utugash's turn.
Noelle: Oh my god, that wasn't even his turn.
Travis: That was the turn, right?
Matt: Utugash stands here with the axe and goes, the mouth not moving, you just hear the voice echoing between your ears. It's sourceless and in your face, "Now that we're all gathered around--" There's a flash of red in the eyes and suddenly the ground circling him erupts into flames. A wall of fire is now currently circling the vicinity.
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: This entire column of 20 foot tall flames encircle him and bursts up, singeing Grog, Trinket, and Tova.
Laura: Just singeing.
Noelle: Seemed like such a good idea!
Liam: How high is the ceiling in that room?
Matt: It's about 25 feet.
Liam: So there's a little space up top?
Matt: A little bit.
Laura: We can see through the fire.
Matt: You can't see through the fire, the fire completely obscures your visual of him. All you see is flames, and you see the vague shadows of Tova, Grog, and Trinket, now currently engulfed in them. I need you guys to all roll dexterity saving throws.
Laura: Natural 20!
Matt: Nice!
Noelle: 15.
Travis: God, son of a bitch. 12.
Matt: All righty, everyone but Trinket failed.
Travis: What, a 15 and 12 don't make it?
Matt: 23 points of fire damage to Grog and Tova.
Travis: Resistant, so I got halved.
Matt: So that's 11 to you and Trinket. Trinket takes 11. Currently nobody else has visual range. You have no vision for Percy. Any ranged attacks, you cannot see the creature. Utugash sits there in the flames surrounding him, seemingly not interested in moving at the moment, enjoying the current position.
Laura: How are we going to get him out of those flames, man?
Liam: Tary, you got some kind of Dispel Magic over there?
Sam: I am so weak.
Laura: Don't you have spells? You have so many spells!
Sam: You guys want a window somewhere?
Noelle: Could you put a window through him? And that would kill him.
Travis: He's real strong.
Liam: All right, I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Vow of Enmity on the bone devil.
Matt: All righty, Vow of Enmity is in play.
Liam: Then I'm going to use one of my two actions, I'm using an action to Disengage from the bone devil and dance back past Doty.
Matt: Dance back past Doty? All righty.
Liam: And then I'm going to chuck a goddamn Vestige at this motherfucker.
Matt: At the bone devil?
Liam: At advantage. Oh, I rolled the same thing on both. 24 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay, so, he's going to get it. Right, here we go. Two plus eight is ten, plus--
Sam: How tall is the room?
Matt: About 25 feet tall.
Sam: So there's a little window on top.
Matt: A little four or five foot gap, very small.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: I already like it. This is a beautiful glimmer in your eye. I'm excited.
Sam: Well, it's something, isn't it?
Liam: 38, and I will Smite him as well. 52.
Matt: 52 points of damage. Nice. As you throw the dagger, as the creature watches you dart past, it streaks out to try and strike at you, but you're already gone. As you turn around, you throw the dagger. It strikes right into the chest of the bone devil, as it bursts with this dark grayish-white light indicative of the Raven Queen's direct impact. As it bursts, you watch as part of the flesh tears open, showing the dark bluish purple sinew and muscle beneath, and the devil just (growls).
Travis: Get out of that hallway!
Liam: That's it, I'm done.
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: Okay. So I'm going to come up in front of the window.
Matt: Okay. You glance in and you just see fire and the butt of Trinket sticking out of the fire.
Laura: Great.
Marisha: And my feet.
Matt: Yeah, just up in the air, kicking.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark the pit fiend?
Matt: You can't see it.
Laura: That's fine. I know where he was, right? Trinket is facing him, so can I try to shoot him with an arrow, anyway?
Matt: I'll say, you have no visual on him. You can go ahead and shoot. Go for it, try it. Disadvantage.
Laura: I have Sharpshooter, I don't know if that helps at all.
Matt: No, he's completely covered.
Laura: Okay, let's try this out. Those are being aggressive. The lower of the two rolls was 29.
Matt: Okay. You watch as you fire your arrow and it disintegrates upon touching the wall of fire. The actual shaft burns as it impacts in the flames.
Laura: Okay.
Noelle: You should've used your fire-proof arrows.
Laura: I know, right? Those fire-proof arrows. Great. If I shot an arrow from a Blazing Bowstring so it was already a fire arrow, you think it would go through?
Matt: Give it a shot.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to do that.
Matt: Okay. So, second attack, Blazing Bowstring, go ahead and roll with disadvantage.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19. You go ahead and fire. It isn't consumed by the flames, but the arrow you hear exit the other side and then ricochet off the far wall and miss the creature's target.
Laura: Well, it could have been cool. Okay. Trinket is going to use his bonus action to try to attack him, even though he's not magical and he's a little piece of shit.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Laura: That is a 26.
Matt: 26 does hit.
Laura: Yeah, go Trinket.
Travis: Come on, Trink.
Laura: Yeah, that's good, too! That's a 15.
Matt: 15. Halve that to seven, seven points of slashing damage across. Through the fire, still bravely fighting into it.
Laura: Yeah. And I'm going to tell Trinket, back the fuck out of the fire, Trinket!
Matt: That's a good plan.
Laura: What are you doing? Stop attacking! Get out of the fire!
Matt: Backs up and gets out of the flames, backing up against the wall.
Laura: Yeah. And then I'm going to back away from the window.
Matt: All right.
Laura: I'm going to back away from the window.
Matt: Where do you want Trinket to land, by the way?
Laura: Just into the corner, like where the angle of the wall is.
Matt: Over there?
Laura: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And I'm going to back away from the window to where he doesn't have visual on me.
Matt: You back out of the way of the window, over here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. As Trinket backs into that corner, I need Trinket to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Of course.
Noelle: Come on, Trinket, come on.
Laura: Come on, Trink!
Travis: Aww.
Noelle: Aww.
Laura: Aww.
Laura: It almost was really good, but it wasn't. Six!
Matt: A giant cage falls from the ceiling of heated metal and lands on him, filled with spikes and (sad bear noises). You hear Trinket yell from the other side. Trinket takes seven points of piercing damage.
Laura: You did that to an animal!
Marisha: You don't fuck with a ranger's bear!
Matt: And six points of fire damage from the heated metal, and Trinket is currently restrained, has to try and break free to get out.
Laura: You're evil.
Matt: Nope, Utugash is evil. There is a definite distinction.
Travis: Mr. Mercer, we pulled you over for speeding tonight. (different voice) No, I wasn't speeding tonight. The pit fiend was speeding.
Matt: It's important, guys. All righty, so. That ends your turn, Vex. Taryon, you're up.
Sam: Jesus.
Travis: Fix everything.
Laura: Make it better.
Sam: I'm nobody! Is it just a cage or is there a door on the bear cage?
Matt: It looks like there is no visible door, you'd have to tear it off of him.
Sam: That's not going to happen. Okay, our last fight, I had hasted myself. That was more than a minute ago, though, right?
Matt: I'd say it's about halfway done. This has all happened pretty quickly, because as soon as the battle started with the cambion that you guys chased out, every round thereafter, it's still going. So you still have five more rounds of Haste.
Sam: Okay, well then, I'll go into the place.
Matt: Okay, you jump over the window. Keyleth breaks your fall.
Sam: Oh. Sorry! It's hard to see with my helmet! No peripheral vision.
Matt: Yeah, and you see a column of flame just flickering and burning in the center of the room. Occasionally, you see a wing tip carve through the top as the creature is moving within the wall of fire.
Sam: Oh my god.
Noelle: (laughs) Do you have a fire extinguisher?
Sam: No! I don't have anything! How far can I move, hasted?
Matt: Double your movement.
Sam: You just double your movement. Okay. So my movement's 30, so I can move in there with him?
Matt: If you wanted to, yeah.
Sam: Okay. I'm just going to go, (yells) and run into the fire.
Matt: You rush into the flames. I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Advantage on dexterity saves. Oh. All right, no. That's nine.
Matt: 30 points of fire damage.
Sam: Halved.
Matt: Halved because of?
Sam: My Helm of Brilliance.
Matt: That's true. There you go. So 15 points of fire damage to you, Taryon. As you rush through, you're like, "Hah!" The fire was enough, and you sit there and look right up on this massive, like, swollen devilish entity with giant red leathery wings, lower jaw with hooked tusks that stick out the bottom, gleaming yellow piercing eyes, giant horns that curl up from the brow, a giant axe in one hand and the other hand just points at you and goes, "Hi." in the center of your head.
Sam: I'm just going to say, "Hi. It's a little warm in here. Here, cool off." And I'll throw acid on him. (laughter)
Matt: All right, go ahead and make the attack.
Sam: I don't know what I'm rolling. 14. This is to hit? It's magic? I don't know, how does this work?
Matt: Well, no-- hold on.
Sam: It's a vial of acid.
Matt: I'm going to pull up your class here, just to check it out.
Sam: I never know if this is a spell attack bonus sort of a thing.
Matt: When you throw it, they have to make a saving throw. So what's your DC?
Sam: The DC of the spell is 17.
Matt: 17. Okay, and it requires a saving throw. Because it's the acid.
Laura: I like how the music stopped while we figure this out.
Matt: It's dexterity. Okay. That is 17.
Sam: So he resists it completely.
Matt: Creature must succeed or take-- yeah, he resists it entirely.
Laura: Balls!
Matt: Yeah, sorry.
Sam: No problem.
Matt: So as you throw it, it hits the edge of the horn and just shatters and breaks behind it.
Sam: Oh. All right. I think I get a bonus still, maybe?
Matt: You do have a bonus.
Sam: I will cast Sanctuary on myself.
Matt: What you do is you have an extra attack-- as Haste you get your action.
Sam: Okay, that was my action.
Matt: That was your action. You have another action to do a melee attack if you want to.
Sam: Ooh, okay. I will stab him with my lance.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Roll for an attack. So yeah, as hasted, you get the additional attack.
Sam: Ooh, that's going to hit. It's a 25.
Matt: That hits, actually. Go ahead and roll the damage. And it is a magical weapon, so he's not resistant to it.
Travis: What sound do you make when you hit him?
Sam: (high-pitched grunt) (laughter)
Sam: Like a breathy (grunts).
Travis: Work on your war face.
Sam: That's 1d12. Thank you very much. That's seven.
Laura: Do you add anything to it?
Sam: No wait, I get a plus six. Ooh, and it was a six! That's 13.
Matt: Is that fire damage?
Sam: No, the fire damage is another plus one, but I don't think you'll be adding that.
Matt: No.
Sam: (laughs) Yeah, so 13.
Matt: 13 points of damage against the pit fiend as you stab it and you can cast Sanctuary on yourself as your bonus.
Sam: I will, and as I do that I also say, Doty-- remember how I said back up Grog? Me! Back up me! (laughter)
Matt: As Doty charges forward and rushes in. I need Doty to make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Oh no. 16 plus-- what's his dexterity?-- zero, so 16.
Matt: Doty takes 30 points of fire damage.
Sam: (groans) He's unconscious.
Marisha: Already?
Sam: I don't know when the last time we rested was but I have down that he only has 30 hit points left. Did he take damage at some point?
Matt: Well because he hurt himself going through the metal outside. So Doty comes rushing in and goes (impact sound) and just collapses on the ground next to you, superheated. (sizzling noise)
Sam: Oh no! Is he going to melt?
Matt: You don't think so.
Sam: He's in the fire, right?
Matt: He's in the fire, yeah.
Sam: Oh god. Is he making some sort of window that someone else could walk over?
Matt: No, the flames curl around, sorry. All right, so that ends Taryon's turn.
Sam: Good, I'm glad I used that last little thing. (laughter)
Sam: Killed my best friend.
Laura: Tary, it's your only friend!
Matt: At the end of the turn, the pit fiend sticks a hand out of the flames and does this motion. Make a perception check again, Grog.
Travis: Not a problem.
Matt: And Tova, both you guys.
Travis: 14.
Liam: Tova fire.
Noelle: A 17.
Matt: 17, okay. Still not quite noticing anything, but you're starting to notice that there are these small, inset stone circles on the wall behind him, over in this area. And you watch as two of them go (stone grinding) and get pressed in by themselves.
Travis: Into the wall, or out from the wall?
Matt: Into the wall. Like something just pressed this giant, circular stone button-- separately.
Travis: We're in an engine.
Matt: So Vax, where you are, the floor, you hear a (click), like something releasing. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Oh well, I'm good. I'm fine, I'm at advantage. Hopefully that's good. Not that good.
Laura: Oh my god. Can you use Luck?
Liam: No, hold on. This is dexterity.
Travis: It might be balloon animals, don't sweat it yet.
Liam: Oh man, it's not great. It's 16.
Laura: Use Luck.
Liam: I think I have one left? I think I have one left. So I'm going to use it.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Oh, that's better. That is 25.
Matt: 25 is enough. The ground suddenly hinges out from under you, and you leap up and jam your blades into each side of the wall and put your foot out to the side, and it's almost not enough to press into the small space, but you just barely catch yourself, Van Damme-style, on each side. The bone demon across from you, its wings flare up as the ground tumbles out from under you. You see about ten feet below you a pool of molten iron that is just (burbling). It stays open, swinging for a few seconds, before it closes once more beneath you.
Liam: Good to know.
Marisha: I'm really glad you used that Luck!
Travis: How do you know it's not molten steel? Kidding.
Matt: One way to find out. That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, jeez! Okay. I roll over.
Matt: You stand up and see Trinket currently trapped in the cage next to you just whining (sad bear whimpers).
Marisha: It's okay, buddy! Just hang on. Tsunami coming though, look out! I'm going to do a Tidal Wave and go (bwoosh). Do you have the laser pointer? What are these red pools of things?
Laura: That's molten blood, he said.
Marisha: It's molten blood?
Matt: All right, so you're doing Tidal Wave.
Marisha: I want to try and avoid my friends. It's ten-foot-wide.
Travis: If you've got to, you know who to aim it at.
Marisha: In fact, there's a ten-foot gap, right, Matt? Between everybody? Right up front?
Matt: Right up front there's a little bit of a gap there, and Doty is on the ground, you can step on Doty.
Marisha: It's ten foot, right? Can I do my Tidal Wave from this direction backwards?
Matt: How wide is the Tidal Wave?
Marisha: Ten feet.
Matt: It's still going to hit somebody.
Marisha: Who's it going to hit?
Matt: There's five feet between Taryon and Tova, and--
Travis: Either me or Taryon. I mean, Doty. Or whoever.
Marisha: I know Grog is dextrous, so Grog can take it. Sorry, Grog. But I want to start here and go backwards. Towards you.
Matt: Towards me? So this way. Okay. You're choosing Taryon?
Marisha: No, Grog, to get hit.
Matt: So, this way?
Marisha: Yeah. It's a ten-foot-wide column that I just want to go back.
Matt: Right. In order for it to hit the pit fiend? It's going to hit either Taryon--
Marisha: Or Grog!
Matt: No, because Grog's far off to the side-- If it comes back this way, it's just going to hit Grog.
Marisha: Sorry, I was confused, when you said Grog. So who's it going to hit?
Matt: It's going to hit either Taryon, or it's going to have to hit Tova and Doty.
Noelle: Do what you've got to do.
Marisha: Tova.
Noelle: Sorry I pushed you out a window. (laughter)
Matt: I need Tova to make a dexterity saving throw.
Marisha: Only because I think she's more dextrous than him.
Noelle: That is 11.
Matt: What is it?
Noelle: 11.
Matt: That's not going to work for a spell DC. However, Utugash does not make the save either! With a roll of a six plus eight, that is a 14. So, that's 4d8 bludgeoning damage, go ahead and roll that.
Sam: Oh man. Kill our own guest?
Marisha: No, it's not that much. Five, six, seven-- Ten, and a reroll, I do an eight! So that's eight-- 23 damage, thank you.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And he should be knocked prone--
Sam: That's not a seven.
Marisha: No, it's an eight. Wait, five, seven, that's 10, 18. 18 damage.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And he's knocked prone.
Matt: As is Tova.
Marisha: And then the water spreads across the ground in all directions, and extinguishes unprotected flames in an area within 30 feet of it?
Matt: Correct!
Marisha: That's all I cared about, mainly?
Matt: So, the water (whoosh), and the wall of fire in that one section (sputtering, fire roaring back to life). Unfortunately, the enchantment continues to produce flames once the spell disseminates the water. The nature of the spell is it perpetually conjures fire. So, there is a brief moment where it causes a gap, and the flames pick up once more. He is knocked prone, he took damage.
Marisha: Okay. I tried. Sorry, guys.
Matt: Are you going to move, or are you going to stay where you are, Keyleth?
Marisha: I'm going to back up as-- Can I crawl? Do I have enough movement to crawl back through the window?
Matt: You do.
Marisha: I'll do that.
Matt: So you go back there, and you can move right back, around--
Marisha: Yeah, I want to keep it, use it as like cover.
Matt: Okay. That ends Keyleth's turn. Tova. Grog.
Noelle: Took some damage. Little bit. But I'm prone.
Matt: So you can get up and use half your movement.
Noelle: Okay, I've got to make a wisdom saving throw to not attack anyone.
Matt: Are you under half health?
Noelle: Yes, I am. Oh! I actually did it! Okay, it's fine, don't worry! False alarm, everything's fine!
Matt: So you maintain control.
Noelle: Don't worry about it! We'll deal with it later when it comes up!
Sam: What would've happened to me?!
Noelle: No, everything's fine! We're good! So, if I stand up, that takes half my turn?
Matt: Half your movement.
Noelle: Okay. Well, I'm going to stand up.
Matt: You're still in the flames, currently.
Noelle: Well, that's not good.
Matt: You can take your turn and then back out of the flames, if you wanted to.
Noelle: I'm going to use my Crimson Rite to light up my claws.
Matt: With what type of--
Noelle: With frozen. Does that help me with fire at all? Can I bat the flames away with my icy paws?
Matt: Your hands feel more comfortable.
Noelle: Okay. (laughter)
Matt: Where once was these giant bear claws, you watch as mystic ice gathers around them, turning into longer razors that extend from your regular claws.
Noelle: All right; I'm going to come to this guy, and--
Laura: Eat it, Utugash!
Noelle: My claw attacks with the Rite, does that increase--
Matt: Not to hit, but it does an additional 1d8 cold damage per strike.
Noelle: All right. That's a 26.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: Do you get advantage because he's prone?
Matt: You do get advantage because he's prone--
Noelle: 24.
Matt: That hits. The third attack, if you want to use your bonus-- You already used your bonus, you only get two. Both hit! Roll damage.
Noelle: All right. That is a 13. And that's a 15.
Matt: Add 2d8 cold damage to that as well, because of your Crimson Rite.
Noelle: 2d8. Can I use my Great Weapon to reroll my one, here?
Matt: Yeah.
Noelle: That is a four and a five. So, nine.
Matt: Nice! That's a total of 37 points of damage in two strikes. Do you want to back out of the flames?
Noelle: Yeah, that'd be good.
Matt: You can get that far out of the way. You back up just out of the fire. Look over, and there's another bear chained in that place. That ends your turn. Grog.
Travis: Osh kosh magosh, it's time for hammers. Can I advance through the ring of fire and on him more?
Matt: Unfortunately, because of both of your sizes, you cannot advance into the ring. He takes up too much space. You're either standing right in the middle of the ring and just taking it, or you're going to have to back out of it.
Laura: What if you jump on him?
Matt: You can try, if you want to.
Laura: You could jump on him!
Travis: That's not actually a terrible idea. Because at the worst I just fall off one side or the other into the boiling blood-- I'll just stay in the ring of fire. I don't want to test the Sriracha pit just yet. Because he's prone, do I get advantage on the attacks without having to use Reckless?
Matt: Correct.
Travis: Can I make all three of my frenzied attacks?
Matt: You may.
Travis: With advantage. 35 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Which is ten, 20. 26?
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Nice. That's 29?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Ten. 26 again. 26 points of damage. 19. C'mon, 37.
Matt: Ooh, all righty.
Travis: That's 22 points of damage.
Matt: 22 points of damage, all right.
Travis: Can I use my Action Surge?
Matt: You may.
Laura: Did you take something?
Travis: Second level in Fighter. Groggy got two more hits.
Matt: That's five attacks in one round.
Travis: I can only do it one time. That's a 23.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 25 points of damage. And that's 29. Hits?
Matt: (high-pitched) Yeah.
Travis: 21 points of damage.
Laura: How much damage did he just do with one turn?
Matt: He did over a hundred.
Travis: But I'm cooking.
Matt: You're staying where you are?
Travis: Yeah, they're really strong hits because I'm burning while I'm doing it. Literally whaling through the fire and just angry.
Matt: Make your dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Advantage on that. That sucks, that's a seven. I have resistance to fire, it's okay.
Matt: 28 points of fire damage. Reduced to half, 14.
Travis: 14, thank you.
Matt: All right, that ends Grog's turn. Percival.
Taliesin: If he's prone, does that mean that negates the difficulty to hit through the ring?
Matt: Well, ranged attacks against prone creatures have disadvantage, naturally, and you can't even see him, you have no visual range. You don't even know that he's prone.
Taliesin: So that's a mess.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I still have my movement, can I move out of the ring?
Matt: I was asking if you wanted to do that or not.
Travis: Oh, I would like to, after all the smashing is done.
Matt: You move out and do not take the last bit of fire damage. You take that when you end your turn in the fire. How far do you back up? Just out of the range?
Travis: Just on the cusp of it.
Matt: You step out of it.
Laura: Not to the other corner where there's probably--
Travis: Probably not.
Taliesin: Yeah, I think I can see that Vax is having a little bit of a problem.
Matt: You can glance to the side, yeah.
Taliesin: There's a window in the door. I'm going to swing around the other side of that door really quickly. Perch on the wall right over there and I'm going to take a couple shots at Mr. Skelly Skellington.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: You're not just in the closet over there sorting through file cabinets?
Taliesin: No, I was tempted to see if it was anything-- We've got him on tax evasion. (laughter) I was hoping we would find a person in there, I'll keep digging. Okay so first shot I'm going to burn a Grit for a torso push.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Actually, I'm going to add Hex to that, just for fun. I'm going to Hex him.
Matt: Okay, cool.
Taliesin: That's 23 to hit.
Matt: 23 hits.
Taliesin: That's 14 points of damage, two points of psychic damage and five points of necrotic. He also has disadvantage on constitution-- checks. And he's pushed ten feet back.
Matt: (slams) up against the wall there.
Taliesin: I'm going to shoot him two more times.
Travis: Is the portcullis closed behind you?
Matt: The portcullis is currently closed. As soon as he pushed through it.
Taliesin: Second shot, I'm going to burn one more Grit and I'm going to try for a head shot. Which will give him disadvantage on next round's attacks.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: 24 to hit.
Matt: 24 hits.
Taliesin: That's 11 points of normal damage, five points of psychic damage and two points of necrotic-- piercing damage. He has to save against a constitution saving throw. Against 20.
Matt: That is a 16.
Taliesin: He has disadvantage on all of his physical attacks for the next round.
Matt: Okay, cool.
Taliesin: One more shot for fun and let's make this a sharpshooter.
Matt: Sure.
Taliesin: That was not my wisest thing ever. 16.
Matt: 16 does not hit, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Oh well.
Liam: I don't think Vax has ever had one of Percival's bullets go right by his ear. It is unsettling.
Taliesin: I'm going to flip back around on the other side of that. I'm going to spider crawl all the way on the other side of that door again.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. At the end of Percival's turn, there is a grinding sound above. Grog, I need you to make another dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Come on, Gil. 18.
Laura: No!
Sam: Is it big enough to cover his big body?
Travis: It's just like a spiked helmet stabbing me in the cheek.
Matt: It gets around your upper torso and sticks partway on, and your arms are (click) to the side. It tears into you. You take 14 points of piercing damage reduced to seven, and then six points of fire damage reduced to three. You are restrained.
Travis: This one has spikes on the inside too?
Matt: Yep.
Travis: And it's hot?
Matt: And it's hot. (sizzles) as the piercing and the fire damage hits you. You are restrained.
Travis: (warbled scream) Is that how you sound, Tary?
Sam: Always.
Matt: The bone devil's going to fly across and it's actually going to fly over Vax and land on the opposite side.
Liam: Did it go past me? Can I get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Nope, it flies up high enough to be out of your range and then drops down, both claws arcing towards you with disadvantage. First one's going to be 22.
Liam: Nope.
Matt: Nice. 18.
Liam: Nope.
Laura: What's your AC?
Liam: Hasted, with both daggers out? It's 23.
Matt: With the tail, it is 19. All three miss.
Sam: Why does he have disadvantage?
Taliesin: I shot him in the face.
Matt: Yeah, one of the eyes got blasted on the side. Part of the skull is broken and destroyed.
Taliesin: That happens when I breathe for a second before I shoot.
Matt: At this point in time--
Laura: Oh no, he's pulling things out!
Liam: More miniatures.
Matt: Two more devil characters come through. The portcullis rises as they pass through, and they go into a full run into this chamber. You see these red-skinned devil humanoids rush in with these long jagged spears. Horned crests on their head, and from where their chins are, there are these writhing tentacles covered in thorns and barbs that move and twist around.
Travis: What sweet hell did your imagination come from?
Matt: Full movement, with the double dash, that guy will get there, this guy will get about there. That's as far as they can get. Not fully up to anybody yet. All right, we have Utugash. Stands up in the flames and looks down at Taryon Darrington.
Sam: Good day to you, sir. Do you know my father?
Matt: You hear the voice echo in the center of your mind, "Good day, and good night!" It's going to make a full round of attacks on you.
Sam: Oh boy.
Matt: So that is 30 to hit.
Sam: Yeah, of course. Doty will save-- Nope.
Matt: As he leans forward and takes a big chunk with his bite out of the front of your-- tries to get to the helmet and the jaw sticks under the chin. That's going to be 24 points of piercing damage. However, you are immune to poison so you don't have to worry about his poison right now thanks to your-- So, the helmet catches most of the brunt of it, and one of the teeth jabs you right underneath the jaw and you can feel it pierce and begin to bleed from underneath. As soon as he pulls back and shoves you aside and releases its grip, as its claw strikes out from its left arm. That is a 16 to hit.
Sam: Because I'm hasted, that does not hit.
Matt: It rolled a two to hit. You just manage to duck out of the way.
Sam: Haha!
Matt: As you say, 'Haha!' the axe comes from the other side-- That is a 22 to hit.
Sam: I have ve-- Ah! Yeah, that hits.
Matt: Double nines. That is 28 points of slashing damage. The flames that currently engulf the axe-- The axe has burst into flames. He swings with it, deals an additional 16 points of fire damage.
Sam: Halved.
Travis: How many ds of what did you roll?
Matt: 6d6.
All: Ooh! No!
Matt: And using the momentum of the axe, the entire body of the pit fiend spins around the tail, whipping towards you. That is 20 to hit.
Sam: Me? But I'm just a man! Yeah, of course that hits.
Matt: As the tail swings past, that is 28 points of bludgeoning damage.
Laura: Are you alive, Tary?
Sam: I'm okay because Marisha reminded me that when I was not here one week, she gave me an extra 17 hit points, which I still have.
Matt: The Inspiring Leader feat.
Sam: They're helping me a lot right now.
Matt: Utugash stays there in the center of the flames, just waiting for people to come to him.
Travis: He still looks nonplussed? Just chill?
Matt: You don't know, you can't see through the fire. That brings us to the top. Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, I'm going to shoot out my fucking wings and I'm going to Hunter's Mark the asshole, and then I'm going to skip--
Matt: The guy you're fighting?
Liam: Yeah. I'm going to skip Disengage and fly backward towards the end of the hall he came out of.
Sam: Matt?
Matt: Yeah?
Sam: On the first of those attacks, I have Sanctuary.
Marisha: You do.
Sam: It's just one wisdom roll.
Matt: Natural 20, plus ten, 30.
Sam: I think it's safe to say, even in retrospect.
Matt: Yeah, sorry. Time progressed as it was meant to. But good call! So, Vax.
Liam: It was wings, Hunter's Mark, chancing a hit as I fly down the hall away from him.
Matt: This way?
Liam: Yeah, that's good.
Matt: It attacks with the tail. Still has disadvantage. 20.
Liam: Nope.
Matt: Just arcs and misses you as you zoom out.
Liam: I'm going to chuck Whisper using a sharpshooter, but at advantage. 26.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: All right. 11, 21 plus psychic damage, sorry, doing math, be right with you. 58.
Matt: 58, nice! That was towards the bone devil?
Liam: Throwing the dagger? Yeah.
Matt: Right. That was with the Sneak Attack damage, because--
Liam: Because I'm at advantage because of Vow of Enmity.
Matt: Vow of Enmity was on the pit fiend.
Liam: No, it was on the bone devil.
Matt: You're right, it was. You're correct.
Liam: Also Hunter's Mark. So let's up that by one.
Matt: All righty. Cool. That's your single attack?
Liam: I used everything. Wings, Hunter's Mark, and the dagger. Bonus, action, action.
Matt: That ends your turn. Vex.
Laura: If I pop through the window, will I be able to get out of the window? I want to pop through the window, get Trinket in the locket; that's what I'm going to do first.
Matt: You come through, step through--
Laura: Go, Buddy!
Matt: As you do, Trinket zooms into the locket, leaving the cage to clank to the ground.
Laura: I'm going to hop back through the window.
Matt: Okay. That's your turn.
Laura: Can I let him back out of the locket from there, or--
Matt: Next turn, you can.
Laura: That's my whole fucking turn?
Matt: Yup! Tary.
Sam: What happened? Oh, it's my turn?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, great!
Matt: You guys would all be taking Fear Aura checks, but you're immune to fear because of your Heroes' Feast. Just letting you know.
Travis: Fear Aura checks? Oh my god.
Sam: You know how sometimes when we're in fights and bad guys can walk around us without incurring damage?
Matt: You only get attacks of opportunity if you move away. If you stay within range, it doesn't--
Sam: I'm going to clock around him, clockwise.
Matt: Until--
Sam: Yeah, right there's pretty good. Do I see any-- I can't see out of the ring, right?
Matt: You are stepping into the flames to do this.
Sam: Ew, what?
Matt: You can get right here on the edge and not be quite in the fire.
Sam: I'll do that. I'll say, it's been lovely having this time with you in private, but our seven minutes in heaven are up. I need you to leave. I will do the Ring of the Ram at full strength and push him out of his own ring. If it works. That's a one. But I'm feeling Lucky. That's a three. Can I feel really Lucky?
Matt: Unfortunately, it does not work that way, Taryon. I am so sorry.
Sam: No, that's fine. Does it fire?
Matt: It does fire, and I believe it's just a miss. It's a hit-or-miss-type circumstance.
Sam: It just misses. I've lost it all there.
Matt: The ram head goes careening out of the wall of fire, slamming into the stone work and causing a big crack in the stone in the wall. The pit fiend says, "I will eat your face first."
Sam: Oh Jesus, I like my face.
Matt: You're still hasted.
Sam: Still hasted. For my second thing, I can only do a melee attack. I can't cast anything, I can't reach into my satchel or anything.
Matt: The bonus action you have from Haste is for weapon attack only. Or you can try and run away.
Sam: Yeah, I could.
Matt: So he'll get an attack of opportunity on you.
Travis: What would Doty do?
Sam: That's fair.
Laura: Fall over and be unconscious, is what Doty would do.
Sam: I will spend the rest of my turn moving back to where Doty was, picking up his book, putting it in my Bag of Holding so it doesn't burn up. Then crawl into a ball and cast Sanctuary on myself. (laughter)
Matt: That ends Taryon's turn.
Sam: If I don't look, he'll go away!
Matt: That brings us to Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Where are the little pissant guys?
Matt: There's one there right next to Grog, and one right next to Doty. So there, and there.
Marisha: I'm going to hop through the window again. I'm going to cast Sunbeam.
Matt: Are you gonna move in to try and get them both in the same path?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Sunbeam it is.
Laura: Matt, can I use my bonus action to at least Hide?
Matt: Sure, roll a stealth check. So it's a constitution saving throw for both of the bearded devils.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Okay, good to know. That is a ten--
Marisha: Negative.
Matt: -- and an 18.
Marisha: Negative again.
Matt: So, 6d8 radiant damage to both and they are both blinded.
Marisha: 6d8? Can I have two more d8s, please? Those were definitely d6s.
Taliesin: I'm sorry, here's a d8.
Marisha: Thank you. Oh that's good. 30 points of radiant damage.
Matt: To both of them. Nice. As the beam (pssh) across the room it streaks down the way and both of them get engulfed. As the beam of bright sunlight energy slowly diminishes, their faces are seared. You see smoke pouring out of their eyes as they're both reaching up to the sockets. That was not so good for them. They're both looking pretty rough already.
Marisha: I look at Tary. Tary is within 30 feet of me, yeah?
Matt: You don't see Tary. You just see a column of fire.
Marisha: I don't see Tary.
Matt: Tary is currently inside the wall of fire, curled in a ball. All you see is a giant column of flame in the center of the room. And half of Doty being slowly heated up.
Marisha: Do I see anyone else, and does anyone else look rough?
Matt: You see Grog with a giant cage on his upper body, wrapping around his torso.
Travis: Just spinning in place (confused screams). (laughter)
Noelle: I'm down to 39 hit points.
Marisha: Do I see Tova?
Matt: You do see Tova, yeah.
Marisha: Okay, I say, hey, sorry about the whole Tsunami thing. You got this! And I give her a Healing Word at level one. I'm going to give you-- shit-- plus my spell modifier. Sorry, nine hit points.
Liam: Fixed.
Noelle: All better now.
Matt: Hey, it helps. It all helps. Trust me, it helps. All right, Keyleth, are you going to stay where you are?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All right, Keyleth stays there. Tova and Grog, you're up.
Noelle: So two questions and one of them is, is my Rite still on?
Matt: Yes it is. Your Rite stays on until you dismiss it.
Noelle: All right, my question also is are these cages still-- would it hurt me to touch one or move one?
Matt: I mean, they're pretty warm to touch.
Noelle: My hands are very cool.
Matt: You know what? Actually, with your claws out, I would say they will do no damage to you because the cold will offset that.
Noelle: All right, so let me know if this sounds doable. I want to grab that cage that Trinket was under.
Matt: Okay.
Noelle: And move it towards where Utugash is. Tary is in the fire, yeah?
Matt: Yes.
Noelle: Can I grab him and pull him back with me, behind this cage?
Matt: He's about 25 feet from you. You don't even know where he is. You know that he's inside the fire, but you don't see him. Because you're outside the flames, all you see is a wall of fire. You have to step into the fire, take the fire damage, grab him and pull him back.
Noelle: Can I just reach (laughs) my cold bear hand into the fire and grab him and pull him out?
Matt: You'll still take the fire damage from the wall of fire, unfortunately.
Noelle: Can I get decreased fire damage?
Matt: It's probably not going to work out. It's magical fire, I'm sorry. But the cage is nearby. You are closer to the cage than you are him. So if you want to grab the cage and move towards him you can do that. Is that what you want to do?
Noelle: Let me-- can I grab this cage and put it between-- this cage is just sitting out, got to do something. Can I throw the cage at that guy who's standing there? He's there, right?
Matt: You can. Go ahead and make a strength check. You have advantage because you are in your bear form.
Noelle: (laughs) That is a 14.
Matt: 14 is fine, that's enough.
Noelle: No, wait. 13. What?
Laura: Didn't you roll an eight?
Liam: Plus your strength of ten. So 18.
Noelle: Oh yeah. Bears are great at math.
Matt: Sorry, this would be an athletics check to lift it, not strength, sorry.
Noelle: Okay, then yeah. 18.
Matt: So you reach over and you grab it and the steam rises up the sides of the cage, and you lift it up over your head, and you're going to go and try to throw it over at this guy there? So as you lift the cage, go ahead and roll for just accuracy on this. Roll an attack, add your proficiency. What did you roll? Oh no. You throw the cage and it rolls into the center of the hallway there, blocking the doorway. Ah, those ones are the worst.
Noelle: I know.
Travis: (laughs) That dice sucks.
Noelle: I know, yeah.
Laura: You seriously need to stop using that one.
Noelle: What else can I do?
Matt: You still have your movement and your bonus if you wanted to do--
Sam: Do you have healing potions?
Matt: You still have your Blood Maladict if you wanted to use any of it.
Noelle: All my stuff is probably in that prison that Percy was in. I don't have any pockets. (laughter)
Sam: Oh yeah.
Noelle: Yeah, I was sort of unprepared for this. I was really excited for this fight.
Marisha: Tiny pockets, this is a problem of women's fashion, to be fair.
Noelle: I know, even with the bears.
Marisha: Why tiny pockets?
Noelle: I know.
Marisha: Come on women's fashion, come on.
Noelle: So I have my bonus action?
Matt: You do.
Laura: What is a Blood Maladict?
Liam: Really cool words on the sheet.
Noelle: I know. Not as helpful as I had hoped. I can see an object's history--
Matt: Grog, what are you doing? While she is figuring this out.
Travis: I'm going to try and get out of the cage.
Matt: All right, go ahead and make a strength skill check.
Travis: I have advantage on those.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Laura: (Grog voice) I have advantage. Ooh, that's good.
Travis: That's better.
Laura: That's better.
Travis: 27.
Matt: 27. As you tense, the metal actually (creaks) and bends out the sides and you just tear the cage off of the top of you. That's your action.
Laura: That's your whole action?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Yep.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: You've got bonuses and stuff, though.
Matt: You do. You have your bonus action if you're still raging, so.
Travis: Yeah, I do!
Liam: Waking up!
Travis: I'm going to throw-- Oh, I just see a column of fire.
Matt: You just see a column of fire.
Travis: But I see a motherfucker behind me, don't I?
Matt: You do, yeah.
Travis: He going to turn to jelly. Do I have my movement?
Matt: You do.
Travis: I would like to visit him, please.
Matt: You turn around, and he's right there. Currently with his eyes smoking from being seared with a Sunbeam.
Travis: Hi! Smash.
Matt: Okay, he's blinded, so you have advantage automatically.
Travis: Yay! Natural 20.
Laura: Oh! Can you imagine if you had been attacking the pit fiend?
Travis: Yeah, I know!
Taliesin: Smear him.
Travis: That's 24-- That's two additional damage die.
Taliesin: Like a fat mosquito.
Travis: 30.
Matt: 30 points of damage?
Travis: Yeah. They were all three really low-damage die rolls. Oh! Actually, I can reroll a one or a two, which was that last one! Nine, that's better.
Sam: Doesn't matter, you killed him.
Marisha: Doesn't matter, he's dead. He's so dead.
Matt: As you turn around and see him there, you go, "Hi," wham. He's going (hisses) and hears this "Hi" and his entire head collapses inward and you shove it down to about the height of the rest of his shoulders. He just (wet collapsing noises) to the ground, and just crumples. And then burns into ash and just cinders left behind. Destroyed.
Travis: Cool, huh?
Matt: That's beautiful, is what it is. Ending Grog's turn, Percival, you're up.
Noelle: Wait, can I take my last thing?
Matt: Oh, yeah, that's right! What're you going to do with your bonus?
Noelle: All right, so I can only move or I can only use my bonus action, yeah?
Matt: Correct, yeah.
Noelle: Okay, well, I'm just going to cast Curse of Mutual Suffering on Utugash one more time.
Matt: You currently do not have visual range on him, you can't see him. Does it say, for the curse, that you need to be able to see the creature? That's the question, let me look.
Noelle: It just says, "a creature within 30 feet."
Matt: So, yeah. So you just know where they are. So you can! Curse of Mutual Suffering does hit Utugash, are you going to amplify it, or not?
Noelle: Am I going to what?
Matt: Amplify it, or leave it as it is?
Noelle: Yeah, I'm going to amplify it.
Matt: Go ahead and roll your d8 and take d8 damage.
Noelle: All right, I'm just going to-- Oh! Six. That is six for me.
Matt: All righty.
Noelle: And then I'm going to throw my bear arms wide and just like--
Matt: (laughs) Come at me, bro? (laughter)
Noelle: 'Sup, asshole?
Matt: Perfect. All righty. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to reload. Because boy, I'm out.
Laura: Bubble throat!
Travis: Bubble throat!
Taliesin: Yeah, no, that's right! I was, like, what? What? Bubble-- Yeah. (gravelly mumbling) Got a little thing. I didn't know it had a name, and now it's the obvious name for it. It's bubble throat. I'm going to swing back around and back up a little bit, and I'm going to take three more potshots at that bone, because that's what I can see.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: I'm not going to get close to him. I'm going to back up a bit. Just back up in the middle of the room. I'm going to keep going.
Matt: About there? Sure. Go for it and take your attacks.
Taliesin: Nothing fancy, attack number one  that's 26 to hit. And that's nine points of piercing damage, five points of necrotic damage, and two points of psychic damage.
Matt: Vax, as you're looking across the room, you see the bone devil (hisses), and it rears back, and the wings span out, it looks like he's about to leap. And as it takes its jump, you watch its face explode forward with dark crimson, just, mist, as the head is blown off of its shoulders.
Marisha: Get that Grit back.
Taliesin: Better! And I'm going to see if I can-- Is there anything? I've got two more shots.
Matt: There is one creature in here that you can barely see through the side.
Taliesin: Oh, I can? Oh, all right, let's do that, that's funny. Another shot at that guy.
Laura: It is really hard to see some of these people.
Taliesin: 23?
Matt: Red creatures on dark red. Sorry.
Taliesin: 23?
Matt: 23 hits.
Taliesin: Oh, and that's right, I don't have that anymore, the Hex isn't until next turn where I can move it. That's 15 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage?
Matt: Okay. Still standing, but it's looking rough. You have advantage on these attacks, by the way, because it's blinded.
Taliesin: Oh! All right. And then I'm going to take another shot. I'm going to make this a sharpshooter, just to end this. Yeah, that'll do. That's 14, 20. 25?
Matt: Yep. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: I didn't know I had advantage, that's lovely. That's 18, 19, 20, 21. 25 points of damage and four points of psychic damage.
Matt: So, after the cage goes flying over his head and clangs behind it, it spins around as it hears the impact, and turns back in the direction of Tova. Even though its eyes are currently held shut from the blinding light of the Sunbeam, it rears back with its hooked pull arm and is about to rush towards the torso of Tova, knowing and being able to sense where she is. Right as it rears back (gunshots), two shots, the second one knocking its head limply across the back of its shoulders, and it tumbles to the ground, unmoving.
Marisha: You get another Grit back!
Taliesin: I get another Grit back.
Travis: Get another Grit back.
Marisha: Get that Grit back.
Matt: Is that the end of your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: That is, other than just backing up a little bit more, as far as I can go, just to get out of the--
Matt: (laughs) Just getting away from everything!
Taliesin: Getting away from everything!
Matt: "Ah! Ah!" Okay, perfect.
Taliesin: I'm good at a distance.
Matt: Okay, so. This is on Utugash's turn  Utugash is going to strike with a bite against Taryon Darrington.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: Frustratingly, that's going to be-- oh, it has to make a wisdom save, doesn't it?
Sam: It does.
Matt: For that first attack, that's a natural 20.
Laura: Oh my god!
Matt: Better that than for the attack! But after that, the first attack was a 18 to hit?
Sam: Hits.
Matt: All righty. As it chomps down onto your torso, this time, as opposed to going for the helmet, it goes for the side of the shoulder, its mouth is large enough to go over your shoulder and come in both the chest and the back of the shoulder as it sinks in. That is going to be 24 points of piercing damage. And you're immune to poison, so you don't take that. You're still standing?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Well, crouching.
Matt: Right.
Marisha: In the fetal position.
Matt: As it's clamped down on you, it takes its claw and rakes across your stomach.
Sam: Technically, it has to roll another wisdom save. It lasts for a minute, it's not per attack, actually.
Matt: It does, you're right! That is a ten plus ten, that is 20.
Sam: He succeeds.
Matt: Okay. The attack roll for that one was a 21.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: So for the claw raking across your torso, that is going to be 21 points of slashing damage.
Sam: (strangled death noises)
Laura: Oh no, Tary!
Matt: And with that, Taryon falls unconscious and bleeding on the ground.
Travis: Tary Jumbo!
Matt: Utugash, after the claws tear across part of the plate armor swings open, and the claw rakes through the side of the torso, leaving the wounds open and bleeding out and steaming across the heavy heated stonework of the room.
Sam: And at that point, do all of their necklaces glow?
Matt: They do. They begin to pulse.
Marisha: That's totally correct, yeah.
Noelle: What's going on?
Travis: I've no idea what this means.
Marisha: Someone's unconscious and we can't tell that they're unconscious.
Matt: At this point, Utugash is going to use his-- The wings take flight at this point, as nothing is immediately in the circle, and he's getting frustrated by this. The wings pick him up in the air. He's going to peek through the top of the form and look over, and he sees Tova and Keyleth, and is going to land, technically on your guys' spaces. This is part of his Corpulent Form ability. I need you both to make dexterity saving throws.
Noelle: Finally, thank you. That is an 18.
Marisha: That's not great. Saving, dex, 14.
Matt: All right. You both suffer 17 points of bludgeoning damage as Utugash's giant form lands on top of you. You are pinned to the ground. You are considered grappled and prone. As Utugash is currently now--
Noelle: So, Utugash also maybe takes some damage from that.
Matt: Yeah, well, takes the same 17 points of damage from the Mutual Suffering.
Noelle: That's something.
Matt: So you're both prone and considered grappled. You cannot move until you get out of the grapple.
Marisha: We're both grappled?
Matt: Yeah, because he's basically sitting on top of you.
Marisha: Fucking dick.
Matt: I need you to make a concentration saving throw to maintain Sunbeam.
Marisha: I have advantage on that.
Matt: You do.
Marisha: I'll take that 18.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, I just have to beat the damage, correct? 18.
Matt: It's either ten or half of the damage, so you're fine. With you both pinned-- you, at immediate visual perspective, look the most vulnerable to Utugash, as you are a tiny half-elf girl, as far as he's concerned. He's going to use his next two attacks, the axe and the tail, with advantage against you because you are currently knocked prone.
Marisha: Aw, desu desu.
Matt: The axe is going to be a 32 to hit?
Marisha: What? 32?
Matt: 32 to hit.
Marisha: I mean, yeah.
Matt: 25 points of slashing damage.
Marisha: 17 plus 20. Plus 23--
Laura: What are you doing concentration on?
Marisha: My Sunbeam.
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: So that's 23 points of slashing damage, plus 23 points of fire damage. So a total of 46.
Marisha: Can I use my reaction to cast Absorb Elements?
Matt: If you have it prepared, yeah.
Marisha: Yes, I do.
Matt: Which allows you to?
Marisha: Never done this before. Let me double-check. I capture some of the energy and I store it, and I have resistance to the next damage type that I take that, and the first time I hit with a melee attack on my next turn, I can do an extra 1d6 of that damage type.
Matt: So you take 11 points of fire damage instead.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Matt: So, it does 34 points of damage total.
Marisha: So another 11 would've made it 82. Okay. I have to beat a ten, correct?
Matt: No, you have beat half of the 34, which would be 17. So you have to beat a 17.
Marisha: Nope. Wait, what do I add?
Matt: Your constitution saving throw.
Marisha: Oh! No, I'm good, then. I'm good, that's exactly a 17?
Matt: Okay. Then that's fine, you succeed. And then the tail's going to slam down onto you as well, Keyleth. With advantage on that. 16. Natural 20.
Marisha: What?
Travis: Matthew!
Matt: Natural 20.
Laura: But, wait, what did the next melee attack do to you?
Matt: This is the tail.
Marisha: It's me attacking.
Matt: It's a nine, a ten, and a seven on 3d10, so that is--
Travis: Oh god.
Matt: 62 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: 60-- wait, how?!
Sam: Halved.
Marisha: Halved. Is it halved? Wait, what?
Matt: No.
Marisha: No.
Sam: No.
Marisha: It's not.
Sam: I just like saying that.
Matt: Well, sorry, it's 20-- it was 52 points, because it was a ten, a nine, and a seven. So it would've been 26, just the dice, crit is 52, plus ten, 62. 62 points.
Marisha: I mean, I'm still up.
Sam: Hey, that's good.
Marisha: With 20 hit points. No. I was at 82 minus 62, which means--
Laura: 20 points.
Marisha: 20 points.
Noelle: So, seeing as he, like, landed on me, could I do anything here? Any reaction?
Matt: Do you have a reaction to do?
Noelle: I don't know. (laughs)
Matt: No, not really, you're just like, "Urgh!" You're being sat on by the pit fiend.
Noelle: Even if I was upright, be like a pincushion to sit on?
Matt: I mean, you're holding it off, but his heavy hide against your pincushion-type nails is not going to do much unless you're physically attacking behind it.
Noelle: Icicles.
Matt: I know. And he's resistant to cold, sorry.
Noelle: Just thought I'd check.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: All right, well, my enemy is gone. Percival just shot it through the face, so. I start to fly towards the entrance. The moment I come through and I see Keyleth mangled on the ground underneath, I just react and fly straight at the thing and snag onto his chest like an angry, pissed-off cat, and I just start slicing.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Liam: I'm actually going to bonus action Hunter's Mark him as I land. I'm going to move the Hunter's Mark, excuse me, from the slain guy.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yep, and okay, and here we go. That is shit. No, well, it's 16. I'm sure it doesn't hit.
Matt: 16 does not hit, no.
Liam: Okay. That is 19.
Matt: 19 does not hit, either. Both angry strikes just hit the hide, but it's too strong, and the devilish scales deflecting the piercing blows.
Liam: I'm going to stay hanging on.
Matt: Okay. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. Hey, I can see him now.
Matt: You can. It's also sitting, currently, on Tova and Keyleth. Keyleth is looking pretty banged up. Tova's looking pretty banged up, and your brother is hacking at it to no avail.
Laura: I don't know what all I could see of that other than just the pit fiend's arm through the window, but I'm going to back up and shoot him. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him first, though!
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And I'm going to-- yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
Matt: Okay. As you back up, he does get a reaction attack of opportunity, because he has a reach.
Laura: Through the window?
Matt: Yeah. As you back up, the tail, after smashing at Keyleth, goes (whoosh) and whips through the window towards you. That's going to be a 25 to hit.
Laura: Yeah, sure, whatever.
Matt: That is 21 points of bludgeoning damage against you.
Laura: Great.
Matt: The tail almost sends you off your feet, almost knocking the wind out of you from the impact to your chest and stomach area. But you slide and catch yourself before tumbling backward.
Laura: (sighs) I hate you. Hunter's Mark!
Travis: Why do you need Hunter's Mark?
Laura: Well, you know.
Liam: I think this is going to be a negative, but a quick clarification question. With them on the ground, then there's no flanking bonus, or anything--
Matt: Nope, they are not threatening him currently.
Liam: That's what I thought. Checking.
Matt: They have to be threatening them to be giving that bonus.
Travis: Tickle!
Matt: (laughs) They are currently under his rump.
Laura: The first one is a one.
Sam: Yay.
Matt: The impact from the chest blow ends up, as you go to grab the arrow, you're already kind of a little off-aim from the the wooziness.
Laura: (grunts in pain) All right. That's fine. I'm going to hit him again, though, or try. That is-- I can add-- 23.
Matt: 23 hits.
Laura: Yes. Okay. Yes! 18 plus one lightning damage, plus 2d6, here we go, and two ones! I'm rolling great! Woo!
Noelle: Want to borrow some dice?
Laura: All of these. All of you guys are goodbyes. And you're a goodbye, too. You can stay.
Matt: All right, so. How much damage was that, total?
Laura: Huh? How much was that?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Oh. 19 total. One of those was lightning damage.
Matt: Okay, good. So, the second arrow does hit. And you're seeing now, Utugash, while looming over and seemingly impervious, at close view, as you get a glance backing up, is looking pretty hurt. Previously, as it's now your second time battling a pit fiend, you're able to see the faint cracks that you're beginning to notice generally show a lot more damage than they do on the surface. So you're starting to see signs of wear, which, based on your previous battle, leads you to believe it's actually pretty hurt. That ends your turn, Vax. And Vex.
Laura: I'm going to back up. I can use the rest of my movement, right?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Laura: And back up around that corner so I'm parallel with Percy there. Yeah, right there.
Matt: Okay. Cool. That brings us to Taryon. I need you to roll a death saving throw.
Sam: Oh, sure. Yeah. Can I feel lucky?
Matt: You can, technically.
Sam: Oh, that's worse. (laughter)
Matt: So that's one failed death saving throw on Tary.
Noelle: Tary.
Laura: I just have a quick question.
Matt: Yeah?
Laura: Since I I haven't used this very much. The Disengage feat that the rogues have, is that a bonus action?
Matt: It's a bonus action to disengage, yeah.
Laura: Okay. Just checking.
Matt: Yeah. You'd already moved your Hunter's Mark, unfortunately, but going forward, you can do that.
Liam: It's a zig-zag motion.
Travis: Serpentine!
Matt: Now.
Travis: Now what?
Noelle: Don't press any more buttons.
Matt: Two imps that were previously invisible in the room and hitting the various buttons across the back wall at his command--
Laura: Oh, it was those fucks.
Matt: Appear and both fly down, swinging towards Keyleth, who's currently pinned underneath. And are just going to begin to start attempting to bite at her. Or, these are the stings, so with advantage, that is six plus five. That is 11. The first one, the stinger hits you, it just can't pierce the armor. The second one is going to go ahead, and with advantage, that is a 13. Just can't pierce the armor. Little imps, they're like-- (snarls) And Utugash is like, "Ugh, hungry carrion wraiths." That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: (sighs) Okay. Time to go big. I am going to cast Shapechange, my 9th-level spell, and I am going to turn into a fire giant.
Laura: A fire giant?
Marisha: Yeah! So as I'm down, my eyes light up, and I start to turn into a giant. And I want to reach up and grab him by the throat and try and stand up and see if I can pile-drive him.
Matt: Okay! Go ahead and roll your attack for your fire giant.
Liam: I'm going for a ride.
Laura: Are you attached to him?
Travis: Are you super strong?
Marisha: I am. Is this plus 11 just to my attacks?
Matt: Everyone else gets pushed out of the way. So yes.
Marisha: Natural 20! (cheering)
Marisha: Thanks, Gil!
Laura: That made up for all the rest of the times he fucked us during this game.
Matt: So, Tova and the imps get pushed aside as Keyleth's form suddenly encompasses most of the corner of the room. Natural 20. You grab Utugash by the throat. Grab the torso, lift him up, slam him onto the ground. Go ahead and roll just the basic damage for the fire elemental's attack. It doesn't knock him prone, but this is the flavor for the attack.
Marisha: How do you know what basic damage is?
Matt: Look for the attack for the fire giant.
Marisha: Well, it just gives me multi-attack.
Matt: And underneath that, it says?
Marisha: And it gives me a greatsword melee attack.
Matt: Yeah, just roll the damage for the greatsword. The attack is the flavor of the strike.
Marisha: That is 6d6. That is one, two, three, four. I need one more.
Liam: I'm on this guy's chest, by the way, and he goes down, and it's landing on the ground, I love what you do! (laughter)
Liam: And I want to somersault away.
Marisha: Ten, 16, 24 damage.
Matt: How much did you roll?
Marisha: 24.
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24. That was with the double?
Marisha: Right! So, doubled that, so 48 damage.
Matt: Plus seven.
Marisha: Plus seven, yeah!
Matt: Yeah. So that is 55 points of damage.
Marisha: (grunts)
Laura: Just say it. I want to hear you say it.
Matt: Well, it's not there yet. (groaning)
Matt: Technically your action was to cast the spell, and you wouldn't have the ability to attack in the same round. But I'm letting you do it, because why not. Because it's fun.
Marisha: Well, I didn't move.
Matt: It's fine. (laughter)
Matt: And we'll say you can't move, this turn. But it was fun. It was cool, why not? All right. That ends your turn, Keyleth?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Tova. Grog.
Noelle: All right. Let's just go all out, here. I'm going to cast--
Matt: It's looking really rough, by the way.
Noelle: -- Blood Curse of the Marked, on Utugash. I'm going to amplify it.
Matt: All righty.
Noelle: Four. Four damage for me. And then I'm going to slide in under this fire giant's legs and go for it with my claws and the Crimson Rite.
Matt: All righty, so at half movement, that's five, ten, 15, 20. You can just get into combat range right there. Knocking Vax over and killing him.
All: (chanting) Tova. Tova. Tova.
Noelle: All right, so that's a 28 to hit on one.
Matt: That hits.
Noelle: And that is a 24 to hit on the second.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: That die's so much better.
Noelle: All right, so that is 11. That is a 13. And I get two more, yeah? Matt? With my Crimson Rite?
Matt: With the claws you do 2d8, and these are doubled because you did your mark.
Noelle: Okay.
Matt: So, what did you roll?
Noelle: A seven. Seven for the 2d8. And then, what did I say, 13 and 11 the first time?
Matt: Yes. So, it's 13 and 11 for the actual weapon damage, for the claws. And then now, what did you roll for the first?
Noelle: Seven, together.
Matt: Seven together. So that's 14? How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Matt: Two guests in a row! All right, so how do you want to do that? As you watch, the fire giant, clutching it by the throat and slamming it onto the ground, Utugash is in this sort of wrestling ring encounter in the center of the room.
Noelle: Just going to fucking body slam him with my bear body and going to hit him with both my claws. Going to tear his fucking throat out.
Travis: Yeah! Yeah!
Noelle: And I'm going to look down at him, and I'm going to be like, how do you like me now, asshole?
Matt: So. Keyleth. In the impressive moment of slamming Utugash down, the grip you have on the throat is loosened suddenly as a secondary force pushes Utugash out of your grip. What looks to be a bowling ball of a fur-like bear form goes slamming into the torso of the devil, who then falls onto the back, as the bear just begins Wolverine berserker barraging, tearing through the chest and torso cavity of the devil. Drops the axe, and is trying to reach up and is clawing at your back and tearing through flesh. You can feel the blood, but you're too focused at this point, the frenzy kicking in from your transformation. And as you stare down and say that into his face, Utugash's tongue is lolling back across the tusks and says, "We'll still find you." And just goes limp across the ground.
Noelle: (deep exhale)
Marisha: I stand up, and I look at Grog. And in Giant I say, "'Sup."
Travis: 'Sup, playa?
Marisha: What's up, man?
Travis: Damn, you be talkin' my lingo!
Marisha: Yeah!
Noelle: I'm going to spit on him while I'm still standing. And I'm just going to flop on my back, turn back into a dwarf. Be like, "Hey, you guys want to get a beer?"
Taliesin: Aren't there still two--
Matt: There are two imps in the chamber. But they both turn invisible as soon as this happens. And they're attempting to escape as the flame wall disappears, and you see Taryon bleeding out on the ground. Next to his superheated--
Liam: Oh. I land and Lay on Hands
Matt: Okay. Yeah, you're close enough to do so.
Liam: Okay. I'll give him ten.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Maybe we just toss him in the blood.
Matt: So how much do you give him?
Liam: Ten.
Matt: Ten. So you have ten hit points. And you come to consciousness.
Sam: Oh! I had the craziest dream.
Liam: Slap!
Sam: Oh!
Liam: Are you all right? Are you really all right? Are you having fun?
Sam: Did I kill it? Again?
Liam: Stone-cold dead, you did. Congratulations.
Matt: I will say, Keyleth?
Marisha: Yeah?
Matt: Because technically they were in melee range with you, since you pushed them out of the way, as they vanish you do get one attack of opportunity across them with disadvantage.
Marisha: Ooh! Am I still all fire giant form?
Matt: Yes you are.
Marisha: That's cool. Okay. With disadvantage?
Matt: With disadvantage.
Marisha: On both of them?
Matt: On just one of them.
Marisha: Just one of them?
Matt: Because you only have one reaction.
Marisha: That's eight plus 11, so that's 20--
Laura: 19.
Matt: That still hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: That's plenty.
Marisha: So that's 7d6 plus six. One, two--
Matt: Don't roll damage. Because even if you rolled all ones, it's just enough to kill it, it has 13 hit points. So, as they both vanish, and you hear the flapping of wings, you just do one wide, Hail Mary arc with your fist, and just (whoosh) and (squeaking screech). One imp just gets spattered across the back of your knuckles. But the other you hear (wings flapping) fly off.
Marisha: (very deep voice) I imagine he's going to tell the others. Oh, this Shapechange has so many weird things!
Taliesin: If I have a moment, I'm going to look in all those doors really quickly.
Laura: I'm going to run over to Percy and give him a kiss and say, nice shooting, stud, and I'm going to help him look.
Taliesin: Okay, then I'm going to wait one second, not to look in those doors. But that happens. And then-- Yeah.
Sam: In fear, I stand up and throw my lance at the fire giant. (laughter)
Matt: Roll an attack!
Marisha: That's fantastic!
Sam: That's a 14.
Matt: What's your AC?
Marisha: 18.
Matt: The lance ricochets off your chest.
Sam: Are you seeing this? Are you all seeing this?
Liam: No, that's the Tempest, that's the Tempest, man. That's Kiki, that's Keyleth.
Marisha: Hi, Tary! I'm Antlers!
Sam: Oh! Good day to you, miss. I've misjudged you again.
Marisha: Fist bump.
Sam: No!
Laura: I shout through the window, loot the body! And I keep looking in the things with Percy.
Matt: Okay. As you glance through the various openings, there're a bunch of cells. Some are empty, some contain long-dead, rotting corpses. The first room that you go into contains a fair amount of gold, and it's just stashed--
Taliesin: We pull it.
Matt: This small stash here is about 12,300 gold pieces.
Laura: (sings) Yeah! Putting that in the stash.
Matt: You also find your equipment. You find your maul and your armor.
Laura: 12,300, you said?
Matt: 12,300 gold. So you have that at your disposal now.
Noelle: I go over, and I'm really happy to put my armor back on over my cool bear bikini that I have on. (laughter)
Matt: Your bear-kini.
Taliesin: Your bear-kini.
Marisha: Your bear-kini.
Matt: As you're putting your armor on, you open the far door on this end, and as you do, suddenly bursting through is a lemure. (groans) Comes towards you with its horrible, fleshy mound just reaching out in your direction.
Taliesin: I threaten it down, and say, run. And owe Orthax your freedom. Run!
Matt: Roll an intimidation check.
Taliesin: Okay, can I use Friends to help with that or no, just go for intimidation?
Matt: If you want to.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'll use Friends to add to that intimidation. So, is that advantage?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: All right. That's cocked. That's fine anyway. Intimidation is, ugh, eight.
Marisha: Aww!
Matt: As you say "Run!", and you see the whole-- the lemure goes (curious grunt).
Taliesin: I shoot my gun next to it.
Laura: I shoot an arrow into it.
Matt: It's actually just going to reach out and strike at you. Then the arrow strike comes right after.
Liam: Vax Dagons onto Keyleth's shoulder and watches all this through the window.
Matt: It misses. His hand slaps against the front of your armor and (slurping, groan), and then roll your attack.
Noelle: (laughs) This is a great confrontation!
Laura: 21.
Matt: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: This is weird. (laughter)
Liam: Good weird, but it's weird.
Laura: 18.
Matt: The arrow (impact noise) through its head, and it just immediately falls to the ground.
Taliesin: I feel like I'm losing it.
Laura: He should've listened. You were very clear, dear.
Taliesin: What's in the other room? (laughter)
Matt: The rest of the chambers here, you find most of it is a collection of rotting meats. You find various sulfurous chemicals, some that you can't really, by scent and texture, identify.
Taliesin: If there's anything interesting?
Matt: Okay, we'll say that you have a handful of chemicals that you may be able to look into later. Five vials, specifically.
Taliesin: Anything on the body? On the giant? On the pit fiend.
Matt: Utugash? There's the axe that Utugash had, which is this very, very large black, metal heated axe.
Travis: Can I see that, please?
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Marisha: Can I pick him up by his ankles and schoolyard bully-style shake him out from his feet, upside-down?
Sam: For pocket change?
Marisha: For pocket change.
Matt: Even for your giant strength, you're like (grunts). He's a very rotund pit fiend, and the red scales, leathery blubber as it moves around-- there wasn't much that he was carrying on him. Most pit fiends, or at least devilish creatures of his stature, don't keep his belongings hidden anywhere on himself. They're visible.
Liam: That's a pretty big meatball.
Laura: Some spicy meatball.
Travis: Does the axe do anything when I hold it?
Matt: It's roughly twice the size of any axe you've held and is too large for you to use.
Laura: Aw.
Noelle: Aw.
Travis: I really think that's a matter of perspective?
Sam: Would you like me to identify the object?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: All right.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Weakly limps over.
Sam: Aye, I'll take a look at it.
Matt: Okay. It's referred to as a Black Iron Axe of Corruption. It's used primarily as a means of intimidating and scaring off lessers, and keeping subordinates in line.
Sam: With magic, or just with size?
Matt: Both. It's a minor enchantment. The enchantment of it, you get the essence as you look at it, the power of it was part of the presence of the pit fiend, it was an inherent ability, so yeah. This is not considered a very powerful magical item. It was only powerful in the hands of a pit fiend.
Travis: I take it. Can I put it in the pool of blood?
Matt: Yeah. (sizzles)
Travis: It dissolved it?
Matt: No, but the heat of it just naturally being in the space, it steams as it goes in.
Travis: That's a deep pool, you guys. Like seriously, drowning warning, okay?
Noelle: So wait, who are you guys again?
Laura: I'm going to pop Trinket out of the necklace and cast Cure Wounds on him.
Noelle: Why are you here?
Travis: Tax collectors.
Taliesin: We were running-- let's just say, we had a grudge and we took care of it.
Noelle: All right, works for me.
Liam: What about you? Where are you from?
Noelle: (sighs) I came here with friends. I don't know if they're still alive, the ones-- well, most of them are dead. I don't know if the other two are still alive, but they're in prison. I've got to rest up. I've got to get back and find them.
Travis: Are they like you?
Noelle: What do you mean, like me?
Travis: I mean like (roars)?
Noelle: Like bears? They're not bears.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: Wait, they're in the prison?
Noelle: Yeah.
Marisha: I Shapechange back to Keyleth for a second. Do you know which section of the prison they're in?
Noelle: (sighs) I guess the same one I was in, yeah? I know roughly. I was in the prison too. Utugash, he bought me. He was going to, I guess corrupt my soul, or whatever, but good luck with that, dude! (laughter)
Laura: Wait, does the Bastion of Flesh sound familiar?
Noelle: Does it?
Matt: You haven't heard the term. You weren't given a lot of information. Most of your presence once you were captured was just being dragged through hallways, tortured, chained up and then eventually purchased and brought here to be perpetually tortured by Utugash until these guys found you.
Noelle: Honestly, I have no idea what's going on still. It's been a hard time in hell. It doesn't sound familiar, but I guess I know where my friends might be. I've got to get back and see if they're still alive, if they're still in there.
Laura: As she's saying this, Trinket goes and grabs some of the rotting meat out of one of those and brings it to her as a present.
Marisha: Aw.
Noelle: I accept it. Thanks, buddy.
Matt: And just gives you a big lick on the side of the face.
Laura: Are you still a bear?
Noelle: I'm a dwarf again.
Matt: No she's a dwarf.
Travis: Oh, are you going to hand it over here now? Thanks.
Noelle: All yours. All yours, pal.
Travis: Is it really rotten?
Matt: It's on par with what you ate before.
Laura: Would you know your way around if you went back to the prison? I mean, do you think you'd know your way through the halls?
Noelle: I think so. I think I'd be able to-- with my bear smell, I think I could find my way back at least to where my friends were. Yeah, I can't leave them in there: if they're still in there, I have no idea, but I came here to help my friend, he made a contract with a devil, and we came here to try and get him out of it.
Laura: Terrible idea.
Taliesin: Always.
Marisha: The worst idea you could ever do.
Sam: Well, we did that, no?
Laura: No, I don't know what you're talking about, Tary.
Sam: Yeah, Percy signed it.
Taliesin: No we didn't.
Noelle: Well, if you were thinking about doing it. Don't. It's a bad idea.
Liam: Since the little ones got away, do we want to turn this into a walk-and-talk?
Laura: Yeah, maybe we should get out of here.
Marisha: Well, okay, hang on. What happens next? Because aren't we supposed to be arrested next?
Travis: Yeah, but we can check out the place until they get here. Can we check the rest of the room first, before we leave?
Matt: Yeah, okay.
Travis: Especially that back wall.
Laura: But being very careful for traps because they are present here.
Travis: Not me, necessarily.
Matt: Oh, so Grog, you're taking point?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Okay. Grog, you enter this chamber, and it opens up into this candelabra area. As you pass this area, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, Grog.
Travis: Okay. 15.
Matt: 15. You take a few steps and then on one of the stone slabs beneath you, a glyph suddenly brightly shines with a strange, pinkish-orange glow, and then you guys watch as a column of somewhat translucent, ethereal energy shoots up, engulfing Grog.
Laura: What are you fucking doing?
Travis: What?
Matt: You suffer 21 points of psychic damage.
Travis: (yelps) I'm too smart again! (laughter)
Liam: I fly in alongside. You know, all you have to do is ask. Will you hold still and give me ten seconds? And I'll check the rest of the room, just in case.
Taliesin: Ew.
Laura: Ew, what is that?
Matt: This is another one of the boiling blood chambers you saw earlier.
Liam: Okay. I'm just going to check for traps.
Taliesin: I like Crimson Peak as much as the next person, but this is kind of over it.
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30? Okay, as you scan the room, you do notice on the inside of each one of these pillars is another one of the similar platforms to the one that Grog triggered, and the one that he triggered here, there are about two, in width.
Liam: There's spots on the ground?
Matt: Yeah, this whole area here, and this area, and there's one here, and one here, and all these can be triggered.
Liam: All right, just hold on-- stay over there. Do I see anything of value or anything else in the room, besides the traps?
Matt: No, but what you do notice-- Vax, you and Vex, and Keyleth, who have the highest passive perception-- you hear from the ceiling above you, what sounds like multiple entities landing on the roof.
Liam: All right, we've got to am-scray.
Marisha: I think reinforcements are here.
Laura: This is definitely what we talked about.
Marisha: Did I see anything that looked like guards that wore like the armor? The gold armor?
Matt: Not in the interior, no.
Marisha: No, throughout the city.
Matt: From where you are right now?
Marisha: Just in general, since I've been in hell.
Laura: Yeah, of course.
Marisha: What are they?
Matt: You've seen the different types. You've seen a couple that have been imps, you've seen a few that have been winged humanoid entities.
Marisha: Were there any like erinyeses or succubuses that were also guards that would be one of these people?
Matt: You didn't see any of that, specifically.
Taliesin: We're going to be okay. We were expecting this.
Marisha: I know, but I could still be a guard and follow you guys there.
Taliesin: Then what?
Marisha: Then I'm someone on the outside and not in prison as maybe a first responder.
Laura: I don't know.
Travis: I think you're overthinking this.
Taliesin: It's a big prison. I think you're going to be very far away from us very quickly.
Marisha: If I say, hey, I found these guys, and I walk with you guys all the way to the prison?
Matt: A hatch from the ceiling in this chamber in here kicks open and about a dozen entities come dropping in, some winged, others like spined similar bearded devils, some of them wearing the golden armor of the Whisperers you've seen throughout the city. It seems that the guard have been called to the assault on this stronghold.
Laura: I get Trinket back in the necklace really fast.
Matt: Okay. Trinket's in the necklace. What's everyone else doing?
Marisha: Can I stealth? Can I turn into one of the impish creatures in gold armor?
Matt: Sure. Yeah, okay. You turn into an imp.
Marisha: Have they seen me yet?
Matt: You don't create equipment, so you would be an imp. You'd have to put on gold armor.
Marisha: I don't have the gold armor.
Matt: Yeah, so you'd just be an imp.
Marisha: Never mind. I'll just be myself for right now.
Matt: Okay. So, you're remaining as Keyleth's half-elf form. All right! What's everyone else doing?
Sam: I drank a healing draught, and I am getting my lance ready, and I'm staying with fucking Doty.
Liam: In which of these rooms did that trap door open?
Matt: It opened here. Grog was waiting over to the side. Grog, these entities landed near you, they just kinda (rumbles), about a dozen of them just swarm into the chamber near you. Vax, you're over here on the side as you're figuring out the traps in this area in the center. So they have been kind of behind you in this area.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to walk towards Grog. I'm going to join him.
Matt: You join up with Grog here.
Laura: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself really fast.
Matt: Okay, we'll say for the purposes of the swarming of entities in this chamber.
Marisha: Who's all been seen? That's a lot.
Travis: We got Dis.
Noelle: Are we all in there? Who's in there?
Matt: Are you guys all going to join? You're staying with Doty?
Sam: I'm staying.
Matt: All right. Percival.
Sam: I'm going to try to see if I can try to start fixing him.
Matt: Okay. You need workshop materials to do it.
Sam: Okay. Well, then I won't do that.
Taliesin: I'm going to sit with Doty. I'm going to stay in the room. I'm just going to be sitting on Doty, probably. MATT. Okay.
Marisha: Are those bone demony guys?
Matt: Bone demons, an erinyes enters, bearded devils, cambions. A whole swarm comes in here.
Marisha: I'll turn into one of the bone devils.
Matt: A chain devil lands.
Marisha: I'll turn into a bone devil.
Matt: Okay. You turn into bone devil form.
Laura: Why?
Liam: Her game, man.
Matt: At this point, they swarm the room, they have their weapons ready, they see you guys standing there not making an aggressive maneuver. The two bone devils that land within the chamber, they seem to be wearing some sort of a sash that has a torn bottom portion of it and some sort of symbol that is holding it together over their shoulder. Looks around. "Do you resist or do you surrender?"
Travis: I'm taking my cues from you, here.
Laura: (high-pitched) We surrender.
Liam: We surrender, Grog.
Travis: I can't say it. You've got say it.
Liam: I surrender, and he's coming along.
Matt: "I will accept this as universal surrender." Puts his arms up and you watch as a number of these individuals begin pulling heavy chain manacles out from sacks and satchels. Two of them immediately charge up and begin shackling Grog, multiple layers of chain and manacles across your arms and legs. They shackle you up and begin to spread into the next room, coming to the rest of you guys. They charge in and begin just, throat manacle, to arms, to ankles, each with somewhat slack chains and has a specific lead chain attached to the center of the whole ensemble. They go from person to person, they throw them on you, though you angrily give in to it. Keyleth, as you approach, one of them turns to you and goes (speaks Infernal).
Marisha: (speaks fake Infernal)
Matt: Make a deception check.
Marisha: Fucking hell!
Matt: With disadvantage.
Travis: You tried Parseltongue.
Liam: Did you say you want to go to the disco with me?
Marisha: Eight. Total.
Noelle: I'm not a butt.
Matt: Leans in real close to you.
Marisha: I give him a little bit of a twitch, like maybe I'm the damaged bone devil.
Matt: "Liar!" The wings (angry fluttering noise) behind it as it points its finger at you. A bunch of the devils begin to swarm in from the sides with the various polearms and jagged weapons pointed in your direction. "Reveal thyself."
Marisha: Oh god. Okay, I drop form.
Matt: "Shackle her. Twice over!" Of everyone, you and Grog both get the Hannibal Lecter treatment. As you're standing there with your spear out, they all begin to swarm around you. Taryon?
Taliesin: I say, oh no, whatever will we do. We have this enormous piece of equipment that you don't understand and could possibly be very dangerous and probably should be locked up with the rest of us. Oh no.
Matt: They don't seem to be paying any mind. They throw the manacles on you. They subdue you very quickly with a swift hit to the back of your shoulders, your sense of bravado is immediately crumbled. They throw you to the ground and chain you up. You are all then chained together and brought to your feet as one of the bone devils approaches. "You are found in the seeding stages of usurpation of a trusted of Dispater and are sentenced to moral reassignment and delivery. You are forfeit to Mentiri." Grabs the chains, tugs, and you guys all begin to be pulled out and then up through the hatch in this chamber, through multitudes of devilish arms. They are pulling you up through the ceiling.
Laura: This is a good plan! Good plan!
Taliesin: It's actually working better than I expected.
Matt: You glance over your shoulder and watch as a series of devils have now leapt onto Doty and are pulling him apart.
Laura: No! This is the part where C-3PO is being pulled apart.
Sam: He served his purpose.
Laura: No!
Matt: And that's where we're going to take a break.
Liam: He read you bedtime stories.
Travis: Holy shit.
Matt: Be back after a short break here. They're going to show a few ads and then the Signal Boost episode that Marisha just put out. We'll continue our story here in just a few minutes, guys. See you in a moment.
Travis: Aw, Doty, poor bastard! [break]
Matt: Welcome back. Hopefully the audio's better for some folks. Thank you for being patient. We have a winner in the Wyrmwood contest we had in the chat room. AlchemistKiller wins this awesome set of zebra wood dice box, dice tray, and the dice roller. So congratulations to you, buddy. This'll be coming your way soon, signed by the cast of Critical Role.
Laura: Killer!
Matt: Now. Diving back into where we were, folks. You guys are yanked out onto the streets of the Iron City of Dis, pulled off of the roof of Utugash's personal stronghold and yanked across the heated cobblestones, having to keep, through what strength you have, standing, for fear of being dragged across the extremely hot floor. As you are brought through, people begin to gather up on the sides of the street. You begin to see other devils gathering towards the edges, and every ten minutes of walking, when there's a crowd gathered around, some of the devils will go ahead and crack one of you in the back of the knee and give off a showing of ownership and a general sense of cheer emerges with each person that gets smacked in the back of the head or thrust down. Percival, you get, at one point, hit along the side of the jaw and you feel the blood fill the side of your mouth, as you wish you could rub it with your hand, though the way the chains are pulling prevent you from raising your arm too high. You hear the hissing and the occasional rocks being thrown from the distance as you're pulled through. Vex and Vax, go ahead and roll perception checks, please.
Liam: 27.
Laura: 31.
Matt: Okay. Vex, as this is happening and you watch Percival recoil from the impact, you glance with a bit of a sneer towards the crowd and you watch amongst all these various toothy, hissing devils, you see one familiar red-skinned man with long-ish dark hair, horns curled up, and as his eyes meet yours, he gives you a smile. And steps back with the crowd as it closes around him.
Laura: I breathe a little easier.
Matt: Bits of filth are being chucked. Grog, one-- not quite sure what form of refuse this is, but it smears and drips down the side of your face, and gets stuck in your beard. (laughter)
Laura: Gross.
Matt: Make a dexterity check.
Travis: Okay. 17.
Matt: 17. You catch it in your mouth. And it is filthy. You don't even know what it is. You regret the impulse immediately.
Travis: (spits)
Matt: This goes on for about 15 minutes as you guys are pulled through. You watch as nearby Whisperers begin to stop and perch on the edge of buildings to watch. You get the sense that what you guys have done has drawn some attention. As you reach the end of this 15-minute period, you're pulled down a large road and the buildings begin to grow a little thin in this area. You're brought to what looks to be a very, very heavy set of doors, this crimson gate that is humongous: 20 feet by ten feet for each side of the gate, so 40 feet across. It leans at an angle, like a gargantuan cellar door that sits on its own in the center. As you begin to approach, you hear chains suddenly (metal scraping). The doors slowly open with a creaking noise as you're brought towards it. They open, and you can see inside it is lightless, it is dark. The two bone devils tugging further, and with each tug, the chains that connect you all choke and pull you forward. You nearly stumble again as you're brought over the stairway lip and down into this darkened chamber below. You are brought down a seemingly endless set of stairs, the darkness only occasionally broken by the passing faintly red-glowing sconce that passes by as you're brought down. You hear the various mutterings of various Infernal phrases being spoken, chuckled between the devils that speak in your vicinity. You then come to a leveling point. The stairs come to an end, the light opening up in this area; still dim, the reddish glow that occasionally gives you a glimpse of the interior. This, you can only imagine, would be what a prison in hell looks like. The metal and stone walls are warped and misshapen in places; they're almost buckling under the weight of the plane they're holding. You can see what looks to be stone arms that are either carved out of the walls or have been jammed into it as part of the decor. And you see giant metal hooks that occasionally eject out the side, some of them with the remains of some sort of prisoner or meat that has been left to slowly rot. More of those small devilish insects you encountered when you first arrived are gathering and feasting on these remnants. You begin to hear various echoes of screams from some distant place within this labyrinthine series of hallways that have bounced through enough walls to the point that it's this constant ringing gasp, occasionally mixed with this high-pitched whine. This wailing, and this sound of horrible torture. It's very familiar to you, Tova. You have no idea how long you were here before, but it seems endless in hindsight. It could have been days, weeks, months; you don't recall. The air itself is extremely hot, stagnant, and humid with sweat and has that subterranean putrescense to it. The idea that mold and suffering pervade the atmosphere. And, as you're carted through these hallways, you're turned right, left, forward past multiple intersections. More devils pass by. You see another erinyes step by with three other minions to her sides. She hisses as you walk past. You are brought past so many different pathways that it begins to all blend. You're trying to pay attention to remember which way you came, but sometimes the turns almost go so fast, it causes you to lose track of where you originally started. You get the essence that not only this is a massive prison, but it's designed to keep anyone from finding their way back out. You turn one corner as you hear a series of very high-intensity screams that cut through the relative din in the background, and as you turn you see three people: two humans and one male half-elf that are naked and strung up by chains in front of what looks like a large forge. You see there a 12-foot-tall horned devil, his wings folded up over his shoulders, these giant crested horns off the front of his skull. Very Tim Curry Legends-style, who's currently heating this long brand in the forge as he's glaring at them. And as you all walk past, his eyes catch yours and he gives you a nod as he sears it in the body of the half-elf, who begins to quiver and scream against the chains. But he just gives you the rest of the head nod as you pass, cross the door, not seeing them any further.
Sam: I can't do this. I can't go in there.
Matt: You hear, as you leave past the doorway, you hear a voice echo from the chamber you just passed, "I'll see you soon enough."
Laura: Great. Can't wait.
Matt: You're brought down another twisting series of intersecting halls, the smell growing more and more rancid the further in you go. You see three chain devils wander past, these roving jailers dragging broken bodies behind them in manacles similar to yours. You see trails of blood streaking across that are slowly turning dry and thick with caked, drying blood, some bits turning to mist across the hot stonework of the interior of the prison. A twitch of one of the legs reveals that these bodies are still living, though by but an inch of their life. A few errant chains that drift and drag behind them creepily caress the arm and face of Taryon as you pass, just across your cheek. One of them scratches you with a hook at the tip.
Laura: You fall unconscious.
Sam: As we're walking, I'm going to whisper to Percy. Are they going to take all our stuff?
Taliesin: It's going to be fine.
Sam: I can't do anything without my stuff.
Taliesin: We're going to be fine.
Matt: Your weapons have been gathered and they have been taken from you.
Sam: Everything? Armor? Helmets?
Matt: You have your armor on you, still. Your helmet is not currently on you, that's been taken off. But your weapons have been taken from you because you can't hold your weapons in your chains.
Laura: That's a break of contract.
Taliesin: Not yet.
Laura: All right.
Matt: So, further still, you're finally brought within this 30 foot by 20 foot room, bisected by a series of thick metal bars that open into a cell. A single, towering chain devil sits within, larger than any you've encountered. The broad shoulders are almost as wide as Grog's, and the head is so deeply set within the neck that it almost gives a profile from shoulder to shoulder of a square. And it cross-- Nice.
Laura: Nope.
Taliesin: Nope.
Marisha: Fuck this asshole.
Matt: The chains all begin to slacken as you enter and the arms reach out almost in a graceful invitation. You hear his horrible voice slither out from the mask of black metal that covers everything but his deep, red, burning, beady eyes. "Good. String them up." As the devil entourage that has pulled you through this prison brings you into the cell one by one, they take your manacles and latch them onto a thick, heavy, metal chain. As they pull, it pulls your arms up over your body and your leg manacles are attached to similar rings on the ground. One by one, you are all placed within this chamber, chained up, helpless.
Sam: This is the worst.
Matt: All the rest of the devils that brought you in here exit the cell and leave through the hallway, leaving the chain devil to do his duty. He approaches the bars as he closes the entranceway to the cell, so he's on the other side of the cell from all of you. You're just strung up in there and he's pressed up against the bars from the other side, his hands clutching as he stares across you, his eyes slowly scanning. As he moves his hands down the bars, the chains go limp and unfurl around parts of his arms and begin to snake and slither across the ground, a dozen of them or so slowly creeping like tendrils of living entities towards all of you as he says, "You seem weary. Let's loosen your load." As the chains begin to snake their way up each of your bodies, Grog, you feel one come up your torso and under the gauntlets and begin to loosen the gauntlets on your arm underneath. Vex, you feel as one curls up, spirals around your leg and finds its way under your armor, and eventually finds the buckles in the back and begins to undo them. All of you find the chains are all beginning to move--
Laura: I saw this movie! (laughter)
Matt: Beginning to infiltrate and remove the various bits of equipment you all came into this area on. A voice rings out from across the chamber in the darkness. It goes, "Krix! You are needed by Overseer Shushot for prisoner enumeration and status!" At which point, the chains stop and the chain devil releases his fingers, tense against the bars. The chains begin to slack and pull back from your bodies and retract back into the chamber. You now see behind him, stepping in, a small green devil with long, knifelike ears, a series of long spines across his body, similar, though a thicker version, of the merchant that you saw earlier on your journey here, this one carrying the same sash that the bone devils that originally arrived had adorned on their chest. It does actually carry a satchel on one side. As the jailer pulls the chains back to his body, he snarls and turns back to this barbed devil, who winces and recoils as soon as the chain devil turns, already taking a submissive stance after making his announcement in the chamber. The chain devil, "I do despise such droll work." Turns back to all the rest of you, "I will return, lovelies." The chains retract back into his body and he walks out of the chamber past the barbed devil, shoulder-checking it on the way through, slips to the side. As it leaves, you're all still there, chained up. The green devil waits, rubbing its shoulder. Comes forward, sheepishly, looking at all of you in silence, breathing heavily, rubbing its chin. Takes its satchel, and you can see it has this hefty satchel on the side that's filled with a series of side pockets and small openings, and it begins to pry them open and it begins to produce each one of your weapons, and is pulling them out quickly and throwing them into a pile on the outside of the bars. Pulls out your packs. The various things that were taken from you have all been put within this satchel and is quickly throwing them into a pile on the other side of the bars from all of you. Throws them all onto the ground. Finishes in this big mass. "There. Unspoiled. Unharmed. Now, to guide you." And the creature walks up to the bars, and clutches the sides staring at you. "You seek Hotis, yes?"
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "He is under the ceiling of Iskath, though Iskath is not in Mentiri this day. You must leave this room, turn right, left, straight, straight, left, straight, then right. The iron door with the fanged grin bears the mark. There lies your quarry. Now! My debt is paid! Goodbye." And the devil turns around and begins to run out of the chamber.
Laura: Oh shit I missed the last thing that he said. I got all the directions, but I didn't hear the very last thing that he said.
Liam: Door with a grin.
Laura: Door with a grin?
Matt: Door with a fanged grin.
Liam: Right, left, straight, straight, left, straight, right.
Laura: Wait I got right, left, straight, straight, left, straight, right.
Travis: That's what I've got, too.
Marisha: Right, left, yeah, right, left, straight, straight, right, left, straight?
Laura: No.
Laura: No.
Laura: Right, left, straight, straight, left, straight, right.
Marisha: Right.
Matt: We'll find out. We'll find out who got the right one. But the devil just leaves.
Laura: And we're still strung up?
Liam: And we're still strung up?
Matt: You're all still strung up.
Sam: I didn't get my phone call!
Liam: I'm going to start doing something.
Laura: I want to try to lockpick, too.
Matt: Your lockpick was taken with your equipment-- unless you were hiding one, you would have to specify.
Laura: Not the one in my mouth. Okay, how about this. I'm going to pop Trinket out of the necklace--
Sam: Oh, wait, do we have the necklace?
Taliesin: They wouldn't have taken it.
Matt: The necklace was not taken off you. It was just your satchels, equipment, and your armor.
Laura: I grab the necklace and I go, Trinket, get out.
Matt: Trinket emerges. (sneezes)
All: Bless you!
Matt: Thank you.
Travis: Allergic to hell.
Laura: Trinket! Get us out of here! Hey, okay, here's the thing. Can you go over and get anything out from between those two bars, on the outside of the room?
Matt: Trinket goes over to the edge of the bars and leans into them and is marking a claw across the ground and it's about a good foot away from the equipment and you can see that smoke begin to rise
Laura: Did you get that?!
Liam: Yes! Dead for a ducat, it's dead! (cheering)
Matt: Five experience to Sam Riegel.
Travis: (laughs) Five experience.
Matt: You can see that the fur is beginning to send off smoke smoke and burn against the bars as he's leaning against them.
Laura: Okay, back away. Maybe you can try and just break through these manacles. Can you do that?
Matt: Reaches up and grabs the one around your ankle and tugs, and you see it begin to singe the outside of his tongue. And he's pulling. Make a strength check.
Laura: Okay. Okay. Okay. 17?
Matt: 17. The chain on one of your ankles begins to bend. It's not quite-- doesn't fully break. But you can see that it's getting some headway.
Laura: I want to pull my leg at the same time and see if I can help him out at all.
Matt: Make a strength check as well.
Laura: Should've had him do this to Grog. Okay. (laughs) I suck at strength checks. Okay. 15.
Matt: 15? Okay. Between both Trinket and you pulling, you do manage to get one of the chains to (snapping sound), and you get one ankle free.
Laura: Great, I have an ankle free. Hey, guys! Guess what? My ankle's free.
Noelle: Lucky.
Laura: I am really flexible. This does nothing.
Liam: Can you Druidcraft into my hand? Can you give me a thorn, something long and thin?
Laura: Yeah, Keyleth, what can you do?
Marisha: I mean, I could probably also Beast Shape out of this if I really wanted to.
Laura: What the fuck, Keyleth?
Liam: Do you really want to?
Marisha: Well, you know, I was kinda waiting to see what everybody else did.
Travis: Less talking, more doing.
Taliesin: Less talking, more doing.
Marisha: Okay. And I Beast Shape into a rat.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can you do that to all of us?
Marisha: Technically, yeah. And then I shape back to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: She's amazing. Every time. Every time.
Marisha: And then keys. Keys, right there on the other side or something? Keys?
Matt: They're about maybe three and a half feet from the edge of the bars.
Marisha: I'm going to do a Thorn Whip. Thorn Whip them to me.
Matt: To your equipment, you mean?
Marisha: Wait.
Matt: Sorry. There's no keys to the door.
Marisha: Oh, sorry.
Matt: No, there's just a pile of--
Liam: Get my lockpicks.
Laura: Yeah, just get the lockpicks.
Marisha: Which are in the satchel on the other side of the bags, right?
Matt: So you Thorn Whip that over. You catch it. You rummage through the pouch that he usually keeps his equipment in. You find the lockpicks that Vax usually uses.
Marisha: I got it!
Liam: Okay, bring it over here, love.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Do you have any extra? You can pass them to me and I can maybe help.
Liam: Already doing it while she's--
Marisha: Are there any other extra lockpicks in here?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: Am I at disadvantage or anything because I'm--
Matt: You are, because you're strung up.
Marisha: Investigation check?
Liam: 27.
Marisha: Natural one.
Matt: You're rummaging through the bag, trying to find it, you're like, I know it's in here somewhere!
Marisha: Honey, you're a hoarder. We really need to clean out your purse.
Laura: Just fucking let me out of this.
Liam: Yeah, I start with my sister.
Matt: Yeah, you eventually get both of your arms and ankles undone, you go up to your sister. She's still looking through the pouch. Roll for Vax-- for Vex.
Travis: Can I try and just muscle out this bitch, since I'm still wearing my Gauntlets?
Matt: Make a strength check.
Liam: 27 again.
Matt: You get her wrists undone.
Liam: All right. I'll just hit the whole group, then.
Travis: 24.
Marisha: I really can't find any--
Matt: Grog just pulls his manacles off the ceiling. The chain (snapping sound). You break them off your wrists.
Laura: I want to go over and start trying to do the lockpick. Oh, actually, I don't have any lockpicks on me, still, do I?
Matt: No. It's across the way.
Liam: I hand her a spare.
Laura: Yeah, thanks. He gives me a spare and I start trying to work on the door while he's doing the others.
Matt: Okay, so you go over and grab a spare from her pouch. You guys begin-- we'll say over the next five minutes or so-- getting everyone undone at this point. You pull-- you have the chains still dangling from your wrists, the manacles still attached to your Titanstone Gauntlets, but you're free.
Travis: I kinda maybe wrap them around, just for a little super there.
Matt: Hell chains.
Travis: Hell chains.
Liam: As I get Tary out. We're going to be fine, this is going to be fine.
Sam: We're in jail.
Liam: I can see you shaking. It's going to be all right. You're with us.
Sam: I have no Doty. Who will record my exploits down here? Why am I here if not to record my adventures?
Travis: You want me to write some stuff down for you?
Sam: No. You're an idiot-- I mean, no thank you, Grog. I lash out when I'm nervous and I don't have my belongings.
Liam: Do you know what to do with a knife?
Sam: Of course. You cut your food before you eat it.
Liam: Okay. You also stick the sharp end of it into things. And I take out the Flametongue, and I stick it in-- this is a loaner. I'll get it back from you when we're done here.
Sam: I take out my rod and make it a dagger and set it on fire.
Liam: Oh, you have that.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Well, you haven't picked up your equipment yet.
Sam: Oh, I don't. I don't? Where is it?
Taliesin: It's on the other side of the bars.
Matt: You're going to try and pick the bars that lead into the next chamber?
Laura: Out the doors, so I can get our shit.
Matt: Okay, so go for it.
Laura: What do I add to it?
Matt: Add your proficiency bonus and your dexterity.
Sam: Everything's outside? Shit. I need that shit.
Laura: 27?
Matt: 27? You get partway into it, and you feel it's moving but it's a very, very difficult lock.
Laura: Jesus.
Travis: Can I try mine?
Laura: Wait, not yet. It's quieter to do this.
Liam: I rest my chin on her shoulder.
Laura: Just, come over, and--
Liam: Is it a sticky one?
Laura: Yeah, it's really, really tough. I could have done the chains on all of us, and you could have done this, but whatever.
Liam: All right. Rather than do it, I just grab a hold of her elbow and I shift her to the side and feel through her bones into the lock and--
Matt: Go for a roll.
Sam: Through her bones?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: You're going through my bones.
Liam: Yeah, man.
Sam: Tova, can't you just curse the lock?
Liam: 27.
Laura: Twins.
Matt: 27 again? You do so and the lock pick kind of breaks off inside.
Liam: Oh, it broke!
Travis: Would anybody care if I try mine?
Laura: Now you've got to.
Taliesin: As long as we're free already--
Liam: Could you "pick the lock," Grog?
Marisha: Wait, who's stuck?
Travis: Kame--
Laura: But quiet.
Travis: -- hame--
Laura: Try to do it quietly. Just quiet. Just quiet.
Travis: -- what do you mean, quiet? I can't hold it, it's so powerful, oh! (yells) (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Laura: Motherfucking door.
Marisha: Fucking doors! It's always doors!
Taliesin: Am I still chained down, by the way?
Liam: No!
Laura: No, no, no! He's been doing everybody.
Taliesin: All right, that's fine.
Travis: I guess it's not a-- what would I add, my strength?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: I'm just rubbing my wrists.
Travis: 26, so, 52?
Matt: It's your strength modifier.
Travis: Which is eight, and I rolled a 18.
Matt: Right. That's 18 to see if you hit, so go ahead and roll damage. For the purposes of this roll, roll 1d4 and add your strength modifier.
Travis: 1d4.
Laura: That's a six, that's a 1d6. Hey! Great!
Travis: Strength modifier, that's ten!
Matt: Ten. Double that, because Siege, so it's 20.
Travis: 20.
Matt: So, with your one-fist punch, between the damage you had done to the lock by messing with it, and the impact of your fist, the lock shatters, and the door squeaks open.
Travis: You loosened it for me. Nice job.
Laura: I reach through and try to grab everything in, pass it out.
Matt: You pull the equipment in, you get your rod, you get everything situated.
Laura: Okay. I cast--
Taliesin: Have we technically had a short rest since we were basically just manacled walking for a while?
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: Okay, just checking.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Travis: Ooh, good call--
Marisha: Do we want to take a short rest while we're supposedly--
Travis: Nope!
Laura: Nope!
Taliesin: Nope, nope, let's just--
Marisha: All right, let's go.
Laura: I think it would be best if maybe we, I mean, I don't know how well we can stealth around here, if we should maybe turn into insects and just crawl around here.
Marisha: I can do that to us.
Laura: I think we should do that.
Marisha: Is everyone cool with that?
Laura: But I've definitely got a Pass Without a Trace still on us.
Taliesin: Can we still Plane Shift later?
Marisha: I can still Plane Shift us, so I can burn one of my higher-level spells-- like an eight on the scale of zero to nine-- and be animals, and then I can save my seventh-level for Plane Shift in case of emergency.
Taliesin: Okay.
Laura: Solid. Copy on that.
Travis: Wait a minute, but doesn't the floor burn? Are we going to flip out of that shape real fast?
Noelle: The floor does burn.
Laura: But maybe those little insects are immune to the fire since they live here.
Travis: But we're animals though, we're not insects. We're animals.
Laura: Wait, we can't be those little--
Travis: No.
Liam: Can't we fly? Can't we be flying?
Marisha: Can I not do that with Animal Shapes? I can't turn into the insects?
Matt: Animal Shapes? You can only do beasts.
Travis: Yeah, I remember we had this conversation before.
Sam: Well, why don't we be pigeons that can fucking fly?
Matt: And the creatures that you saw, the insects here, are technically very, very small fiends.
Marisha: Hm.
Laura: Oh, really?
Liam: But we could be hornets, or flies?
Marisha: Have I seen anything, like flies or rats or anything like that?
Travis: Not insects.
Laura: Not insects.
Matt: You've seen rats, but they don't do well here because of the heat.
Liam: There's flies all over this shit.
Laura: Maybe hummingbirds, something, the teensiest bird you can think of.
Liam: We're not in the woods though. Flies.
Marisha: Hang on, I've seen rats, and I've seen what? Have I seen any--
Laura: We can't be insects, we can only be animals.
Marisha: I've got to be beasts.
Laura: Yeah, so teeny teeny teeny, like, finches or hummingbirds.
Marisha: Are there anything like bats? Have I ever seen any bats?
Laura: Ooh, bats, down here?
Matt: You've seen bats before, you haven't seen bats that reside in this domain.
Laura: Whatever, as long as we're flying, maybe we can be stealthy. We'll be stealhty bats.
Travis: What happens if we hit a door on this right-left-straight-straight-left-straight-right?
Sam: Let's just walk.
Marisha: I mean, technically, with Animal Shapes, I can change us with an action. Correct?
Matt: That's true. I think so, yeah.
Laura: So we can just shift in and out whenever we want? With an action?
Marisha: Yeah, as long as we don't get caught.
Travis: I don't mind starting out that way.
Liam: All right.
Laura: Okay, I think getting-- yeah, we should, it's easier to not get caught. And then we'll stealth as bats.
Taliesin: Stealthy bats.
Marisha: All right. So we're starting as bats. Bats?
Laura: Sure.
Travis: What do our bats sound like?
Liam: "Where is Harvey Dent?" (high-pitched squealing)
Matt: Okay. This is concentration, so this will get rid of your Shapechange.
Marisha: Correct. So as long as we're cool with me losing my ninth-level Shapechange. I can't escort us as an erinyes anymore.
Sam: I think we should just walk, but if you want to do this, you can.
Travis: Ooh, wait! Well--
Laura: I think we'll just-- there's a lot of demons around here. Devils.
Marisha: How much longer is my Shapechange left? It lasts for an hour.
Travis: You don't speak that shit, is the problem.
Matt: You're not quite certain, but it's pushing close to an hour.
Laura: Yeah, you don't speak the shit, so even if you have it--
Marisha: I don't speak the shit. So, bats!
Laura: Stealthy bats. We fly close to the ceiling and be as quiet as possible.
Noelle: I don't care for this.
Travis: I know it's not a bear, but at least they both start with a... D.
Noelle: Bears, bats--
Matt: All of you guys turn into bats, flapping.
Marisha: Wait, I can technically make some of us bats and some of us other things, correct? I can choose.
Matt: Yup.
Marisha: Does anyone not want to be a bat for any particular reason?
Laura: I'm solid with the bat, but I'm going to lead the way since I'm good with directions.
Sam: Since bats can't see, maybe we should--
Taliesin: They can see!
Travis: Take off, I'll follow you.
Matt: Essentially, you get--
Marisha: Sonar.
Laura: Oh, but we can still see where we're going.
Matt: Yeah. The equivalent of Darkvision. You know where you're going.
Marisha: Echolocation.
Laura: Is it echolocation only?
Taliesin: No, they have both. I mean, biologically, they have both.
Marisha: We have Darkvision.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: I'm following Vex out.
Taliesin: Yup.
Marisha: Bats go in swarms. We're all bats.
Matt: All right, so a bat swarm suddenly emerges into the hallway, which immediately turns right and left. Which direction do you go?
Laura: Right.
Matt: Okay, you turn right, and as you guys rush into the corner, you watch as the chain devil that originally arrived in the first chamber--
Laura: Flying close to the ceiling, stealthy.
Sam: Stealthy.
Matt: Right. It's about 15 feet up to the ceiling, and you guys come up. The chain devil walks beneath, and as you guys arc past him, he kind of stops and looks over and watches you all go past him and he keeps walking, looking very confused.
Liam: Fly with purpose, fly with purpose.
Laura: Okay. Fly with purpose, fly with purpose.
Matt: All right. So you guys continue.
Laura: As soon as we get to a thing, we turn left.
Matt: Yes. So you go forward for about 60, 70 feet or so. You see a couple of small imps also fly past, and you guys kind of dart around, and they all look curiously at these bats that are swarming past them.
Marisha: This is the best.
Laura: At least they're letting us go right now.
Taliesin: Everything's fine.
Matt: You come to a T intersection now.
Laura: Left. Oh!
Travis: Straight.
Liam: Straight.
Sam: Wait, do we go right? What?
Laura: Wait, no, we haven't gone left yet.
Liam: We didn't take a left yet?
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: I thought we were taking it.
Matt: You turned right.
Laura: Yes, and now we're going to turn left.
Matt: And then you turn left. All right. You all shift, following Vex's pathway, left. And as you go forward in that direction, you watch as another chain devil and two barbed devils, similar to the one that came in there and brought your equipment, are patrolling down the hall. As you guys are approaching, I want everyone to roll a stealth check.
Liam: Yeah. Plus ten.
Laura: Plus ten!
Marisha: Plus ten.
Laura: I'm going to say Trinket's back in the necklace, by the way.
Matt: I assumed.
Laura: Okay.
Noelle: So that plus ten for them, that was their Feast?
Laura: No, that was me, I did that.
Travis: Pass Without a Trace.
Matt: Spell she cast she cast on everybody, so everyone gets plus ten dice.
Noelle: Oh, okay! Cool! Cool.
Sam: 17.
Taliesin: 35.
Marisha: 26.
Liam: 37.
Noelle: 15.
Laura: 34.
Travis: 25.
Matt: Okay. As you guys (fluttering noises) past, the barbed devils just keep walking forward. The chain devil stops and turns and looks over and sees you all.
Laura: Just keep flying!
Matt: And turns and starts walking in your direction as you guys keep flying. You come to a gate that is closed.
Taliesin: A gate!
Liam: Solid, or bars?
Matt: It's solid, there is a small opening with some bars that are about that far apart each.
Laura: Let's go through them.
Taliesin: We can go through.
Matt: You guys as bats press through the gate, just as--
Laura: Avoiding the bars! Avoiding the bars.
Matt: -- just as the chain devil runs up to try and grab at you as you guys charge through, his arms catching the gate, and you hear him start yelling, and suddenly you start hearing in the distance, behind where you were, sounds like rapid footprints, footfalls. Apparently, people are now aware that you have escaped your cell.
Laura: Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Noelle: Fuck.
Sam: I'm Batman.
Matt: So. You guys continue rushing forward.
Marisha: We can always be rats whenever the time is necessary!
Travis: No, no, we'll burn out of it. We'll burn out of it.
Laura: Let's just keep going.
Marisha: Keep going.
Matt: You guys come to another T section.
Laura: Straight!
Matt: You go straight on this one? All right. You go straight past. Beneath you, you can see there's another one of those blood pools that was in Utugash's chamber, and there are a couple of grates on each side. You can see the grates are corroded with the quick glances as you go past. As you continue straight forward, you hear more screams from the right and left side, the two hallways that you pass, just kind of (screaming) echoing past, and you just keep pushing forward as best as you can. You hear the gate in the distance open, so now you know, whoever was giving chase, they're now starting to pick up behind you. You come up to what looks to be a right and left.
Sam: Wait, what?
Laura: Wait, only a right and left? But we have two straights in a row!
Sam: We go straight!
Liam: Yeah. Is there any hidden door here? Search for a hidden door.
Sam: We go straight into the wall!
Liam: I'm searching for a door, as a bat.
Taliesin: Straight, in the door, keep going straight.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: Come on, come on! Come on!
Laura: Keep going straight.
Liam: 18.
Matt: 18? You briefly glance forward as you guys sit here for a second, and you begin to hear the distant sound of various Infernal yells getting louder and louder. Something about the wall right in front of you doesn't look right.
Laura: Keep going straight!
Liam: I start battering into the door.
Laura: Can we batter into it, or can we just fly straight through?
Matt: Vax just passes straight through. It's an illusory wall. (yelling)
Matt: As you guys (flapping noise) into this next chamber--
Liam: Everybody's doing something different.
Matt: Yeah.
Noelle: It's like, 'fuck, okay'.
Matt: Tova's so confused--
Noelle: This has been a weird day.
Liam: Aren't you glad you're playing with us?
Laura: Tary's got wings coming out of his head.
Matt: As you guys are flying, in this new chamber it is pitch black. Thankfully, your vision allows you as best to see. Tova, you start having the recurring memory of the fact that you're not sure where they're going, where they're taking you, but you still have people in this prison.
Noelle: Yeah. Am I looking out? Do I recognize anything that we're passing?
Matt: You have no idea where they are and you have no idea where you are currently.
Noelle: Can I use my heightened senses to do a perception check and see if I can smell anything?
Matt: You would if you weren't a bat.
Noelle: I mean, there's nothing in the rule book that says bats can't have heightened senses.
Marisha: Hang on. Well, technically, what do bats have?
Travis: Not a great sense of smell. That's for sure.
Noelle: I don't need to be a bear to do that. It says that's just part of my class.
Matt: I know, I know. When you're in your normal form you would.
Sam: As bats--
Matt: As bats however, it's a little more rough. Let me check real fast just to be safe.
Noelle: Can I use my sonar?
Marisha: 5e bats--
Matt: Here we go.
Taliesin: Nothing quite like googling '5e bats'.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Bats--
Matt: Let's say swarm of bats. That's basically what you guys are all together.
Marisha: That's true. We are a swarm of bats.
Matt: Now, you have echolocation so you can, you know--
Liam: Oh man, put us in a Strahd campaign.
Matt: You have keen hearing but that's not going to help you tremendously in this circumstance. So yeah, there is a sinking feeling that right now, either you-- going with them, you might leave your friends behind. Just be aware. As you guys push forward into this dark chamber, it continues forward and then dips down into a series of stairs. Takes you to a secondary level below. As you guys follow this down for about 45 feet, it evens out again and opens up into another T-intersection.
Laura: Left!
Travis: Left!
Matt: All right. You guys go ahead and turn left. As you turn, right around the corner, there waiting, you see there is a single bone devil and three flying spined devils. These deep blue, dark green, imp-like devils with these giant spined wings and these long quills sticking out of their body as they carry these spears. And you all almost-- you encounter each other at once. The spined devils are up in your area and as you kind of flutter past there's no way they didn't see you.
Laura: Chaos. Chaos.
Marisha: (bat squeaks)
Liam: Drop some guano.
Laura: Yeah, I poop.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 'I poop'.
Taliesin: Smells better than the prison.
Liam: Guano, guano, guano.
Matt: As this is happening, the bone devil stops and turns and the spine devils that get caught up in the area, two of them are going to instinctively swing at you guys as you move past.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: That is going to be-- there's the spined devil here. That is an eight.
Sam: Oh wow.
Taliesin: Oh.
Sam: That might actually miss.
Matt: I think it does, actually. The worst possible-- A bat has an AC of 12.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Sam: Guys, we have one hit point, by the way.
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Those bats were jus-- I made no promises other than bats.
Travis: One hit point?
Matt: One hit point, each of you. The other one is going to swing. Same roll! Two sixes in a row. (cheering)
Matt: Eight. Eight. That is-- aw, man.
Travis: 'Aw, man!'
Liam: Matt turned 12! Matt turned 12!
Matt: So both of them miss as you guys continue pushing forward past these--
Marisha: Go, go, go!
Matt: However, the full speed of a bat, if I remember--
Sam: 30 feet.
Matt: Is it 30-foot speed?
Sam: It's a 30-foot fly speed.
Marisha: And we're definitely doubling our movement here.
Taliesin: And we're doubling movement.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: We're dashing.
Marisha: And we're dashing
Matt: The spine devils are a little faster than you guys.
Sam: Ooh.
Matt: And they're gaining on you. As you move past, they get their attack swings but you guys do double dash so they're behind you. And now they're all starting to slowly gain. As they're pushing forward and pushing forward, you come to another T-intersection.
Laura: Straight!
Matt: You go straight, okay. As you go straight forward, it kind of curves a little bit to the right and then continues forward. The spine devils are just starting to catch up to you guys and two of them go ahead and-- Let's see what attacks they have here.
Noelle: Are we passing any cells?
Matt: They're both going to fire tail spines at you. Their tail curves up behind and swings. And they fire these spines forward.
Laura: Fly zig zag! Fly zig zag!
Sam: Serpentine.
Matt: There's three of them so one of them's going to be at Grog, one's going to be at Vax and one's going to be at Percy. Against Grog, that is a two plus four. These guys can't hit anything. Six. Just zooms past you. One towards Vax. That's cocked. Natural 20. (groaning)
Matt: And against you, Percy. That is a 19 plus two, so both of you guys get hit.
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: Even basic damage, both of your bat forms (boof) and you both fall about ten feet.
Liam: Is it an attack roll or--
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, they both hit-- spines hit you. You both take--
Liam: But if it's under my AC?
Laura: No, it's a bat's AC.
Travis: You're a bat.
Liam: Oh we're a bat-- bat's AC.
Marisha: Bat AC.
Matt: Bat's AC, which is 12.
Liam: Thanks.
Matt: So that's six-- So you take five points of damage, Vax, to your main form, and Percival, you take four points of damage to your main form. Oh, plus one point of fire damage and two points of fire damage.
Liam: My armor is set to fire, so do I take one anyway?
Matt: You still take one.
Liam: Okay.
Taliesin: Okay, yeah. Just the two of us.
Matt: All right, so the rest of you are bats. Both of you plummet, hit the ground, and the spine devils approach.
Taliesin: Attempt to acrobat roll, so that I'm up and rolling?
Sam: Oh boy. Here we go.
Laura: Oh dear lord.
Matt: So now, we have Vax and--
Marisha: We did pretty good, you guys. We got pretty far.
Laura: Yeah, we did get pretty far.
Taliesin: We did a lot. We did well.
Matt: Vax and Percival are back this way, I'm going to say that these guys represent you as bats. We'll say that Taryon is one, Keyleth is two, Tova is three, Vex is four, and Grog is five. All right. So, we'll use these for spine devils for now. Well actually they're pretty small, so we'll use these. So these are the spine devils right here, and you see a bone devil coming up in the distance. So I need everyone to roll initiative.
Travis: Yeah! Don't fuck me, Gil! That's it, go!
Liam: Terrible. Terrible.
Marisha: All right. Not great.
Matt: All right. So, that brings us to-- 25 to 20.
Taliesin: 30.
Noelle: 25.
Laura: Wow.
Matt: Jesus, Percival.
Travis: 20.
Matt: So, 30, 20.
Travis: Tova had--
Noelle: 25.
Matt: 25, nice.
Taliesin: Are we making noise now? Do we care?
Noelle: No, that was bad math. 23.
Matt: Okay, still good.
Marisha: I don't know. If we can get in and out of this quick and keep going--
Matt: 20 to 15?
Marisha: -- because I can keep turning us into these.
Matt: All right, 15 to ten.
Travis: 15 to ten.
Marisha: 11. As long as I don't lose concentration I can keep turning us into different things.
Taliesin: Including the two of us, even though we hit one?
Marisha: Correct.
Taliesin: Good to know.
Matt: All right. Ten to five.
Liam: Big seven.
Laura: Eight.
Marisha: It's a concentration of up to 24 hours, so as long as I don't use a concentration--
Travis: What are you, Tary?
Sam: Four.
Laura: Oh!
Matt: Nice.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Marisha: On a subsequent turn, I can use my action to transform affected creatures into new forms.
Matt: So. Now in these forms, if it looks like it--
Sam: We do get an attack.
Matt: You do, but you attack as a bat.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Rabies.
Laura: Can Keyleth just--
Sam: And a hit is one point of piercing damage.
Laura: Wait, what was your initiative order? What was your number?
Marisha: 11.
Laura: Fuck.
Marisha: Not great.
Noelle: We're stuck as bats until she lets us out?
Matt: Yup.
Laura: As long as you just stay out of the way and don't break your concentration, you can keep turning us in and out?
Marisha: Correct.
Laura: Okay. Don't get hit.
Marisha: So that's probably exactly what I'm going to do, is to try and not get hit, by the by.
Matt: Percival. You just plummeted to the ground. Actually, both you and Vax from the fall, since you were 15 feet up, you both took two points of bludgeoning damage, and five points of bludgeoning damage, Vax.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to take my six paces towards the lava pit, and then--
Travis: Is it a blood pit or a lava pit?
Matt: It's a blood pit.
Taliesin: -- blood pit, and then I'm going to hold my attack until Vax does what he's going to do.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm loud.
Liam: Yeah. And I'm weak.
Matt: All right, that ends Percy's turn. Tova.
Noelle: So, can I go from a bat to a bear?
Liam: Bat-bear! Were-bat-bear! Batman.
Sam: There, bat-bear.
Laura: Tricky, tricky.
Liam: Bear-man. Man-bear.
Matt: The magic keeps you--
Marisha: "Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range, you transform each target into the form of a large or smaller beast."
Matt: Technically, you are not a dwarf. You are not a Blood Hunter. You lost the abilities of your class while you are currently a bat, so currently you just have bat capabilities. You could move and then hold your action if you were to change forms. It's up to you. Kind of what Percy did.
Taliesin: Get in position and then wait.
Noelle: I'm going to fly over with my dudes and hang out and hold my action.
Matt: All right, so you'll hang there. All right. Grog.
Travis: I'm just following Vex.
Matt: Okay, so you'll just kind of stay over in this area.
Travis: I'm real good with directions but, let's be honest.
Matt: All right. So these three spine devils who just hit the other-- This one here is going to rush over to this side, is going to fire, this is going to be at Tova. It's going to fire its tail spine. That is an eight. I keep rolling sixes to hit. Misses, no effect. These two other spine devils here are going to-- There we go, they're going to come forward and do a multi-attack on Vax. Both of them are just going to pincer up this way. One with its bite, and one with its fork. Actually, technically it gets to use two tail spines. It's going to make a second strike at you, Tova. That is an 11, misses still.
Noelle: Yup. I mean, unless my--
Sam: Unhittable bats.
Noelle: Unless my bat stats are-- bad.
Matt: Bat AC is 12, so you're actually like (whoosh), you dodge out of the way.
Noelle: Oh, okay.
Matt: And that is a seven, and a 21. 21 hit you?
Liam: No. Nope. Oh, it just hits me.
Matt: It just? That's what I thought. So you take five points of piercing damage.
Liam: Can I Uncanny Dodge?
Matt: All right, you take two points of piercing damage.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: The other one is going to attack you again twice as well. That's a four and an 11. Nope.
Liam: Yeah, eat it.
Matt: Ending their turn now. The bone devil is going to catch up, flies in, its wings expanding forward, it's going to go ahead and make three attacks against you, Vax, since you're the closest one to it. That is ten, 20, and 20.
Liam: No.
Matt: Two twelves in a row. You just (whoosh), dodging out of the way, being crazy rogue, evading. That brings us now to Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, shit. Can I change people as a bat?
Matt: Yeah, as an action, you can change your form, which is an action.
Marisha: But can I stay as a bat and change other people?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah?
Matt: It says here, "On a subsequent action you can use your actions to transform affected creatures into new forms." So yeah. I don't see why you couldn't.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to turn-- do you want to be a bat, too?
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm useless.
Marisha: I'm going to turn both Vax and Percy into bats. What? I asked what you wanted to be and you said a bat. Bat! We're both bats!
Liam: That is what I want to be. You just do it.
Travis: You didn't even have time to ask that question.
Marisha: And we're peaced out again.
Laura: If we can, we're going to peace out.
Marisha: If we can, we're going to peace out.
Matt: Who else is going to turn into bats?
Sam: Bats. We're all bats.
Laura: We're all bats again.
Matt: Okay. All right. And so you're just going to do that? It's your turn, you going to move?
Marisha: I'm going to look at Vex and go (squeaking noise).
Laura: I wink as a bat like I totally understand her.
Matt: Okay. Is that your turn, Keyleth?
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Travis: You're not going to move?
Marisha: I'm following her!
Laura: Well, would she move? She's got to wait until Vax gets out of there, now he's surrounded and he's a bat.
Marisha: Vex was leading the way, she knows where to go.
Matt: Vex, your turn.
Laura: I want to lead everybody away down to the right, but I've got to make sure that my brother gets away from these thugs before that happens, so I'm going to hold my movement until-- can I--
Matt: You can't hold your movement, you can only hold an action. You can hold a dash action.
Laura: I'm going to hold my dash action, then, until I see that he's safe. Or at least he's away from them, so we can get going.
Liam: As a bat, do I have an action and bonus action like Vax does, or just one thing now?
Matt: You have your action as a bat. You can dash, still, if you want to.
Liam: Well, I will disengage as a bat?
Matt: Disengage is an action.
Liam: Can I use my action to disengage?
Matt: So you could.
Laura: Bats disengage.
Liam: Yeah. We're in new territory.
Matt: Anybody can disengage as an action, it's just a combat action. You just can't do anything else, the only thing you can do is move with your speed after that.
Liam: If they hit me, I'm back to being in regular form again, and there's three of them, so I'm going to disengage--
Matt: All right, so you disengage.
Liam: -- and then fly as far as I can towards the group.
Matt: Okay, 30 feet. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. That's where you get.
Laura: Okay, I see him, and we have everybody now. I take off to the right.
Matt: Which way is the right? You guys moved in this way? So, this way.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So using your dash action--
Laura: It was the last thing, it was to the right was the final turn. Right?
Sam: Yup, yup.
Marisha: Right, yeah, to the right.
Taliesin: I've been holding an action, right? Can I burn that as a dash action?
Laura: I know! Why did he say it like that, like it was--
Marisha: Yeah, as far as we know, the right means right.
Sam: Maybe it's stage right.
Laura: But everything else was-- I'm going to the right. That's the last intersection that I know.
Matt: All right, so that ends Vex's turn there. Taryon.
Sam: I'm going to go where she went. And further if I can.
Matt: And you are off the page, over that way.
Taliesin: Can I burn my action as a dash?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm burning my action as a dash.
Matt: All right, so that's--
Marisha: Let's go!
Sam: Bye!
Laura: Toodles. As much as we can be, toodles.
Marisha: Dear god, I can't believe this shit.
Matt: That brings us to Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to keep booking.
Matt: Five, ten, 30, and you also with a double move get to there. Okay. Next up is Tova.
Noelle: Oh, I'll just keep going with the rest.
Matt: You just keep going? All right, so you catch up with these guys here way off the map. All righty. Grog.
Travis: I'm going to burn my "ashton" as a "darsh." (laughter)
Matt: (gibberish) All righty. With that, the spine devils are going to move forward.
Laura: Who is that? Is that Keyleth?
Matt: That is Percy.
Laura: Oh, it is? No, but Percy's off the map!
Matt: Oh, I'm sorry. It's Keyleth. Yeah, because I have one-two, but you guys both transformed.
Marisha: But I was holding my movement to move with Vex.
Laura: You can't hold movement.
Taliesin: You can't hold movement.
Marisha: I can't fucking hold a movement. I did an action to make sure they were bats.
Matt: Yep. So you get swarmed by three spined devils.
Laura: Fucking balls. This is not good planning.
Liam: We might be able to outrun them.
Matt: Not in this form. Attacks against you. Yep, that's an 18. Keyleth, you take six points of slashing damage. Your bat form is gone, you drop that. You become Keyleth again and you take five points of damage carried over. Then it's going to get its tail attack against you. It's going to miss. The other one's going to bite. Miss. Tail attack is going to be a 17. What's your AC?
Marisha: Currently, 16.
Matt: So you take six points of piercing damage. The last one's going to get its last two attacks on you. That is a 21 and a natural one. So the last attack you get is four points of slashing damage.
Marisha: So it's six plus four total? So, ten? Okay.
Matt: And I need you to go ahead and make three concentration checks. It's got to beat ten each time.
Marisha: Good the first time. Good the second time. And seven plus my constitution, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: So that is an 11 the third time.
Matt: Your constitution saving throw?
Marisha: All three.
Matt: That's enough. So you maintain concentration on the spell.
Laura: Solid.
Liam: Thanks, Keyleth.
Marisha: You're welcome!
Matt: The bone devil flies up and is now going after Keyleth with all of its might.
Marisha: Did we heal any? We didn't do any of that healing or anything, did we?
Matt: Nope! You didn't have time.
Marisha: That's cool.
Matt: Three attacks. That is going to be an 18 for its claw.
Marisha: Hit.
Matt: Second claw, that's a 27.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: And the sting is a 25. So all three hit you. So you take nine points of slashing damage. Concentration check.
Marisha: I mean, I'm about to go down. I make it!
Matt: All right. That is 12 points of slashing damage.
Marisha: I'm down. Everyone's about to hit the ground.
Matt: Keyleth falls unconscious. And the tail strikes you, auto crit. You lose two death saving throws. (yelling)
Taliesin: We're all human now.
Marisha: And you're all human.
Matt: All of you drop form. So four would be Vex.
Taliesin: Okay, got to fix this super fast.
Marisha: Really not looking good.
Laura: Everybody's far away from her except for me and-- who's the other person?
Matt: Aw man, where did my Vex model go?
Laura: Oh no, did I disappear?
Matt: I think I may actually have left you on the other map. That's okay, I'll be fine for this one.
Laura: Oh, because I was in a corner.
Matt: I'll use the erinyes for you. That's fine.
Laura: That's okay, that's pretty hot. Can you put a little marker on me so I can see it? I can't see the erinyes.
Matt: That's you.
Laura: Okay. Thank you.
Matt: You're welcome. Percival, Vax, Taryon, Tova.
Sam: Percy, my necklace is glowing.
Taliesin: Yeah, we all know.
Sam: And I'm not a bat. Does that mean Keyleth's dead?
Matt: End of their turn. Keyleth. It's your turn. You're next in the initiative order.
Taliesin: Oh shit, no.
Laura: Oh god.
Marisha: Oh my god, I've never been here. I don't want to die. Who do I do this to?
Sam: You just rolled it.
Marisha: I did. It's a 13. Technically. Yeah. I was going to switch dice, but that's a 13, I'll take that.
Matt: Was it the intentional roll?
Marisha: No. Okay.
Taliesin: No, that's not-- Oh.
Marisha: Don't fuck me Gil. I'm good. I'm good.
Matt: What did you roll?
Marisha: It's a 12. I rolled a 12.
Matt: Okay. Still bleeding out. Man, losing that Plane Shift.
Marisha: A success. What did you just say?
Laura: Oh my god, if she dies, we're fucked
Marisha: Yeah, I know.
Travis: That was a big oversight.
Matt: That would've been campaign over. Okay.
Marisha: No, we're good, guys. Come on.
Taliesin: That might be campaign over.
Matt: Well, I don't know.
Travis: Oh my god, what the fuck were we thinking?
Matt: I'm so nervous right now, oh my god.
Laura: I'm up! I run forward and I slide on my knees and put my hand on her and cast Cure Wounds at 4th level. On Keyleth.
Matt: Okay. All right. SAM. Campaign resumes.
Matt: Holy shit.
Marisha: I'm great, I'm good.
Travis: Aw, man. That roll was bigger than I knew.
Taliesin: Yeah, that would've been fucking bad.
Matt: You guys have a spreading urgency of the entire prison of Mentiri now bearing down on escaped mortal criminals. Without Plane Shift, if that doesn't work...
Marisha: Okay, all right. So we have the extreme hint.
Sam: But we were bats, Matt. That was pretty fine planning.
Marisha: That was awesome. It was going great.
Laura: 27 points.
Matt: You heal 27 points, Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: That's my action.
Matt: Your movement.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: You have a bonus.
Travis: You want to heal yourself? Potions?
Laura: I'm going to pop Trinket out, as my bonus.
Matt: Whereabouts?
Laura: Behind-- sure, whatever.
Matt: I'll say, just instinctually, you pop him out about there.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And that was my full movement and everything, wasn't it?
Matt: Yeah. All right, Vax, it's your turn.
Liam: I run and skip right up next to my sister and I have a potion of superior healing and I pour it into Keyleth's mouth.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I'm conscious.
Liam: Yes, I know.
Matt: (gurgles) (laughter)
Liam: 22 more.
Marisha: Oh, okay. Vax! I'm at 49 hit points.
Matt: You didn't realize until the last moment and was like, "Oh, if Keyleth goes down."
Laura: Bad News Bears.
Liam: How long has it been since the pit fiend moment?
Matt: It's been roughly an hour. A little over an hour.
Liam: All right. And I'm going to, as a bonus action, chuck Whisper into-- no, it has to be tied to an action, doesn't it?
Matt: It has to be after an attack, yeah.
Liam: Oh, well there's nothing else I can do.
Taliesin: Stand her up.
Liam: I can get up with a bonus action, though?
Marisha: Can you help me up?
Liam: No, bonus action was the potion, no? Can't the potion be a bonus?
Laura: No, not if you give it to somebody else.
Liam: Okay. Then I'm done.
Matt: So, Taryon.
Laura: Do you have any spells? Like a Bless or anything?
Liam: No, I'm out.
Sam: How far away am I?
Matt: You're about-- with 30-foot movement you can get within range where you can see any of the creatures.
Sam: Okay. I'll run back then, I guess.
Matt: Okay. You'll get there.
Laura: Bring everything in to use so you can just (poosh) to them.
Matt: Yeah. You have these three little spine devils that are like flying imps covered in spines that are relatively small, and you have one big bone devil-- that was the one that just almost killed Keyleth.
Sam: I'll throw acid at one, I guess.
Matt: At which one?
Sam: The one who looks the meanest.
Matt: That's the bone devil. All right. Dex save. That is a 14. What's your DC?
Sam: 17.
Matt: So yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Yay.
Sam: Okay. Give me some sixes. And one more. Boom. Oh, lots. (laughter)
Laura: How did this happen? How did we get here?
Sam: 25.
Matt: 25 points of acid damage to the bone devil.
Laura: Nice!
Liam: Fiancee and campaign? Killed.
Matt: So as the vial breaks across the front of its body, you can see the acid burn its flesh. It curls into itself; you can see the smoke rising off of it as its flesh is beginning to burn and melt away. Nice. That's your turn.
Sam: All right, I will cast Sanctuary on young Keyleth.
Matt: Oh shit!
Taliesin: Nice!
Laura: That's the first time you've helped another person, right?
Sam: In my life. (laughter)
Matt: Oh, Taryon. All right, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Fuck sound at this point, I suppose. I'm going to run and just get them into view.
Matt: Yep, you got them.
Taliesin: All right. Three shots, and I'm going to do a pushback on all three and I'm going to push them all--
Matt: The spine devils, you mean?
Taliesin: Spine devil, spine devil, bone devil.
Matt: Okay, so there's three spine devils and one bone devil. So two spine devils and one bone devil.
Taliesin: Three spine devils and one bone devil?
Matt: Yes. Three spine devils and one bone devil.
Taliesin: Three spine devils and one bone devil?
Travis: Stop saying it.
Marisha: No Coke, Pepsi.
Taliesin: No Coke, Pepsi. And the bone devil's a real problem, I suppose.
Matt: He's the dangerous-looking one.
Taliesin: Okay, in that case, I'm going to push him back. I'm going to do a shot to push him back.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: And that's a 19, 29--
Matt: Yeah, you hit.
Liam: Pop-pop-pop, motherfucker!
Laura: (sing "mmmbop")
Marisha: (sing "mmmbop")
Taliesin: That's my power song, you don't even know. 15 points of damage, plus five psychic, and he moves backwards ten feet.
Matt: So 20 damage. He pushes back just that far, but he hits the wall. He can't get pushed back further.
Taliesin: Can't get pushed any-- he's still--
Matt: Still right there.
Liam: Percy's in hell, Hanson playing in his brain.
Matt: He's already up against the wall.
Taliesin: All right. Second, I'll take a spine devil, the one that's threatening the most people?
Sam: That song is not called "Doo-Bop." It's called "Mmmbop."
Laura: That's what I said.
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: That hits. Roll damage.
Taliesin: That's not the damage. Oh yeah. 17 points of damage and six points of psychic damage.
Matt: You scatter one of the spine devils with one shot. Blasts apart.
Taliesin: The other one, I'm going to spend a point for Grit for deadeye, just to get advantage.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: That's cocked. 29?
Matt: 29 hits.
Taliesin: 14 points of damage and one point of psychic?
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: He's still standing?
Matt: Still standing.
Taliesin: Action surge.
Liam: Yes!
Taliesin: Three more shots.
Sam: Three more?
Taliesin: Hitting him again. Same thing, with a Grit.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's good to do. 24 to hit?
Matt: Hits. This is against the second spine devil, yeah.
Taliesin: That's 11 points of damage and four psychic.
Matt: He scatters.
Taliesin: Third spine devil. Same thing-- actually, I get my Grit back. Third spine devil.
Matt: These shots are (gunshots).
Taliesin: Yeah, actually, I'll reroll the cocked one, but it doesn't matter. Yeah. That hits.
Matt: Echoing through the hall. Everyone who is ever searching for anything knows exactly where to go now.
Taliesin: Yeah, fuck it. It's worth it, though. 13 points of damage and five psychic.
Matt: Okay. Still standing, but looking rough.
Taliesin: And another shot, same thing, with advantage. That's fine. 24?
Matt: 24. Yep.
Taliesin: Thank god they're easy to hit. That's 16 points of damage and four psychic.
Matt: The third spine devil's upper torso is disintegrated by the blast. Its wings flick off to its sides, spattering part of the bone devil.
Taliesin: I'm going to spend my last Grit. Last Grit is a shot to the spine devil.
Matt: That was already three attacks. That was three more attacks.
Taliesin: That was one, two--
Matt: Yeah, you killed the second one, and then shot twice to kill a third one. So you're out of attacks.
Taliesin: I'm done. Reload, and that's the end of my turn.
Matt: All righty. At this point, you guys can hear distant yelling getting louder and louder down the hallway where you came from. You hear the voices echoing and swarming, and people are starting to get closer, knowing where you are. Tova, you're up.
Noelle: How many of these devil-guys are left?
Matt: There's just the one bone devil left.
Noelle: Okay. I'm going to run back a full 45 feet. How close can I get to him?
Matt: 45? You can get about there. You're about ten, 15 feet from him. Ten feet.
Liam: You got any projectile shit?
Noelle: I do not.
Taliesin: Need to heal?
Noelle: That would help.
Taliesin: Do you have anything to heal with? (laughter)
Noelle: Don't think so.
Travis: You hungry? Yeah. You have any food? (laughter)
Noelle: Who's closest to me, here?
Matt: Currently, it's Vax, the half-elf rogue guy.
Noelle: Can I save my action?
Matt: You could.
Noelle: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, because you haven't had a short rest, so you don't have your blood curses back, yeah.
Noelle: Yeah, no, I don't have--
Matt: Okay. So you're just going to hold your action just in case it comes near?
Noelle: Yeah, I'll just hang out with my new friends here.
Matt: Okay. Sounds good. Grog.
Travis: Go running in 50 feet. (war cry)
Matt: 50 feet puts you standing over Keyleth, pretty much.
Travis: Am I in melee distance?
Matt: You are in melee distance.
Travis: Reckless attacks!
Laura: Yes, kill it so we can run away.
Travis: 29.
Matt: You do have a point of exhaustion, by the way.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: 29 hits.
Travis: 24 points.
Matt: 24 points of damage, all righty.
Travis: Second one, reckless. Natural 20.
All: Oh!
Liam: From the gods.
Marisha: Yes, from the gods.
Travis: 24, 27, 34. 34 points of damage.
Matt: Well, did you double the dice?
Travis: Did two additional damage dice rolls.
Matt: Right, so you did the first one--
Travis: Initial one, and then I did two more d10s.
Matt: Okay, so the total was?
Travis: 34.
Matt: 34. All righty.
Travis: Yeah, because I have two levels of brutal critical.
Matt: Great, so those are your two attacks.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right. That brings us to the bone devil's turn.
Laura: Oh, he's still alive?
Matt: Yeah, he's still alive. And seeing everybody rush in and help this wounded creature on the ground--
Noelle: Matt? Can I-- sorry, keep going.
Matt: Okay. You sure?
Noelle: Can I use the blood curses-- I can use it three times per short rest, so I have one more, right? I did two in the prison.
Matt: Two Mutual Suffering, and you did your Mark.
Noelle: Oh, you're right, okay. You're right. Did three. Sorry. Carry on.
Matt: It's all good. All right, so. It's going to go ahead-- actually, no, let me roll to see which way it goes. Okay, yeah, it's not that intelligent. So intelligence check, you being the immediate threat, it turns attention towards you as opposed to Keyleth, who's currently on the ground. As you're the biggest threat to it at the moment, it's going to go ahead and make three strikes at you. That is 16?
Travis: Misses!
Matt: 16?
Travis: Misses!
Marisha: Come on, Grog!
Matt: 17.
Travis: Hits!
Matt: Ah, finally. Eight, eight, nine. (laughs) All right. That is 16 points of piercing damage, and no poison because you are immune.
Travis: Word.
Matt: All right. That ends its turn, and it's going to shift over, flying over onto this way, the coasting in the center there, and getting over Keyleth, getting closer to the blood pool--
Travis: May I make a retali--
Matt: Retaliation? Yes, you can. As a reaction, you can.
Marisha: Come on, kill it!
Travis: Reckless, please. 30.
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Travis: Yeah. 24.
Matt: 24 points of damage. As it flies over you through the air, you arc in the direction with your hammer, and as you do, it breaks its entire ribcage inward. You hear the shattering of bones, and it gives out this wheeze as you follow through and slam it back down where it was standing.
Travis: Sweet! (cheering)
Laura: Keyleth, can you do a Wall of Stone?
Marisha: Yeah, into the corridor.
Laura: Yeah, block it!
Travis: Do it here so they don't know which way we went.
Sam: They know the layout of this prison.
Travis: Yeah, but they don't know which direction we went.
Matt: You guys hear voices now coming from the other sides, as well.
Sam: Let me do something. I'm going to use my Scroll of Programmed Illusion.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Have any creatures talked to us in Common down here? With their mouths, not with their minds?
Matt: There have been a handful, yeah.
Sam: What kind?
Matt: They've been the cambion, the guy you met earlier with the red skin who made the deal with Percival.
Travis: The chain devil.
Matt: The chain devil spoke Common.
Sam: Okay. Did he work in the prison?
Matt: The chain devil did.
Sam: Great, chain devil. So I'm going to make a Programmed Illusion. Upon anyone approaching, a chain devil will appear over the dead bodies that we just killed and say, "There were five of them. They went that way!" And point down the hallway that we just came out of. "Go, get them now! Make them pay!" (cheering)
Matt: All righty. As you pull the scroll out, and you watch the scroll burst into flame as you finish the incantation, you watch as out of the blood pool, rising, this chain devil, looking real, material, steps up and walks over to the bodies and sits there looking over them, waiting for someone to trigger.
Laura: Okay, we should put Dust of Tracelessness down. Dust of Tracelessness on the ground!
Matt: Okay, you start flower girling your way.
Marisha: I hold my Wall of Stone, since he has that, because I don't want to make it apparent.
Matt: Get this map out if we can? Okay, so you guys continue to the right. Thank you. And bring the last one in. You guys head down this hallway for about another hundred feet, hearing the shouts behind. You hear conversation, different languages happening. They're getting a little more distant. You're catching some ground here, and it's going well. Eventually you make your way--
Sam: Jesus, there's another whole fucking map?
Marisha: The doors, always. This is Matt Mercer we're talking about.
Liam: I'm looking for fucking traps.
Matt: You guys make your way down to the end of this chamber, and you see three different doors that are all closed off, to the front, to the right, and the left.
Liam: Fanged smiles.
Laura: Fanged smile.
Matt: As you're making your investigation check, you hear what sounds like the writhing of chains and the pulling of heavy metal grinding. As you begin to look and inspect the doors real fast, you glance up, and the entire ceiling is a sea of rolling chains, all gathering, and then from the ceiling bursts down in the center of the chamber-- (yelling)
Matt: A chain golem slams into the center, its glowing red eyes from underneath. All right. As you guys have all scattered amongst these chambers you ran down, Vax just rushed up and began to inspect these here. What are you guys doing?
Marisha: Wait, is this it? Is this where we're supposed to be?
Taliesin: We've got to find out which room he's in.
Matt: All right. Everyone roll initiative.
Travis: Oh my god. What size is that thing?
Matt: It's almost 20 feet tall, and when it slams the ground, it's hunched forward. If it were standing upright, it would scrape the ceiling.
Travis: So it's fire giant size.
Matt: A little bit under fire giant size, but you watch the chains from the ceiling are still attached to it. It's like the whole ceiling and upper portion of this chamber is made of chains that are feeding it.
Laura: Do we have anything to freeze?
Marisha: To freeze? Yeah. We have our shit back, right?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: If we can freeze him in place, maybe. He's made of metal.
Matt: 25 to 20.
Laura: 24.
Matt: 24.
Noelle: 21.
Matt: Tova. And what did you roll for your investigation check earlier?
Liam: Oh, 22.
Matt: 22. This doorway, the first one you checked? Does not seem to have-- the symbol on it appears to be some sort of Infernal symbol that you don't recognize. All right. 20 to 15?
Marisha: 17.
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Travis: 13.
Matt: Taryon?
Sam: Two.
Travis: Wow.
Liam: Eight for Vax.
Matt: All right. Vex, you're up first.
Laura: Can I run to the other doors that Vax has been looking at?
Matt: Which one of these are you checking?
Laura: Huh?
Matt: Which one of these doors are you checking?
Laura: The far one in the back. Yeah. And I'll look for the symbol.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. You go and look up, and this one has a symbol that looks like a half-moon that is broken and is bleeding into a pool below it.
Laura: And I'm looking for a fanged grin?
Matt: It's a crescent half-moon that looks like it's broken in the middle.
Laura: That totally could be a fanged grin. Okay.
Sam: Which one?
Laura: The very back door.
Matt: This one and this one have been inspected. So that's your movement to get up there. And your action to look thoroughly and look at the symbol in the low light. You have a bonus still.
Laura: Yeah. Is it possible to bonus hide?
Matt: You have nowhere to hide from. You have nothing obscuring.
Laura: Nothing to obscure the view?
Matt: Not really.
Laura: Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus to pop Trinket out.
Matt: Okay. Trinket appears out of your necklace.
Laura: I guess he was already out, wasn't he? Because we were running.
Matt: Yeah, but you may have pulled him back in. It's fine.
Laura: That's a waste of bonus. (laughs) No, I'm going to Hunter's Mark. So Trinket was out. I'm going to Hunter's Mark the guy.
Matt: All right, I'll go with it. Hunter's Mark on the chain golem. Tova, your turn.
Noelle: Okay. I'm going to run over there behind the chain golem where Vex is. I'm going to do a perception check. I guess I'll check out this last door.
Matt: Okay.
Noelle: Can I do a general sense of smell for the whole area and see if I smell anything coming from any of these prisons?
Matt: Sure. Make a perception check as you're rushing in.
Laura: What about symbols? Do you see anything?
Matt: With advantage.
Noelle: Yep. All right. So that is a 23.
Matt: 23. The chambers seem to have various scents that kind of mix in this area. The one on the far end has this ancient, dusty, decay smell to it. The one on the opposite side of the chamber has a weirdly iron, rusty old metal scent, and the doorway that you're at right now has a very strong scent of sulfur.
Noelle: Is there anything on the door?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Noelle: Where's investigation? That's an 18.
Matt: You knock the dust from the side, and as you inspect closely, hearing the chains grinding and spinning around you, and occasionally you duck because you see one kind of whip across and break part of the stone and cause chunks of it to fly off. You look down, and you see two small eyes and one deep, toothy grin.
Noelle: Hey, this one's smiling!
Laura: But is it a fanged grin? A fanged grin is usually cocked. But it looks more--
Noelle: He doesn't appear sincere, so. What do I have left?
Matt: Well, as a note, just remember this, it took you a while to get there because the chains that were rolling around it are entangling and wrapping around the area, so you were at half movement, which got you just to there. I forgot to mention that earlier. However, the chains, in the process, are crushing and doing damage as you move through them. Six points of bludgeoning damage to you as you pull your way through the chains getting to that area. All right, that ends Tova's turn. It is now the chain golem's turn.
Noelle: Do I have an extra action or anything?
Matt: Your action was to do the investigation. You have your bonus, if you have something to spend it with.
Noelle: Turn into a bear?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: (laughs) "I turn into a bear?"
Matt: And bear form. (sings) And bear form. There is your bear form. All righty. So ending Tova's turn, it is now the golem's turn. The golem has a ten-foot range on its slam. It's going to do two slam attacks. It's going to reach out and slam once at Percy, who is within its front range there after landing, and Keyleth, who's immediately to its left.
Laura: Don't fucking die, Keyleth.
Matt: A physical slam attack. A giant battering-ram of heavy, thick chains are going to punch out towards Percival. The fist swings, and almost merges with the rest of the body as a second arm forms where it was and then backfists into Keyleth. Like its form shifts with the chains that move around within its body, and its form is ever-changing and shifting, like a giant amoeba of moving metal. The first attack towards Percival. That is 27 to hit.
Taliesin: Oh my god, yes.
Matt: All right. You suffer 22 points of bludgeoning damage. And against Keyleth, that is a 25 to hit.
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: Keyleth, you take 21 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Is Sanctuary still working on her?
Matt: Actually, Sanctuary is on. Has to make a wisdom saving throw before it can do that. Which it fails! You take no damage. (cheering)
Matt: It rolled a two and had a zero wisdom modifier.
Marisha: Oh, that's good, that's great.
Matt: So as it goes to strike you, the second fist appears and then seems to dwindle and fall to the ground, and it forms again in the spot where it was. You watch as multiple arms are now forming and coming out of it at different places. It's going to back up. As it does so, its eyes shift. These two red, beady points of light that form its eyes kind of shift to the back of its head, and now you see they're almost moving around, and it's keeping a visual range of everything in the room.
Taliesin: Do I get an attack of opportunity since we're moving out of its combat range?
Matt: No. It was not in your combat range. It had reach, unfortunately. That ends its turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. I need to stay alive. Who's close to me in a 30-foot radius? And who's looking rough?
Travis: You.
Matt: Everyone but Vex and Trinket are in a 30-foot radius.
Marisha: Okay. I want to start backing out a little bit, and who's lowest on hit points? Legit.
Laura: You.
Liam: You.
Noelle: I have 19 hit points left.
Sam: And me.
Marisha: Me, Tova, Taryon, and I can pick three more people. I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds.
Taliesin: Who else wants it?
Liam: I'll take it. I'm at like two-thirds, I guess?
Marisha: Vax.
Taliesin: Grog, you want it?
Marisha: Anyone else looking relatively low?
Travis: No, I'm not relatively low.
Laura: If you can do it to everybody, why not?
Marisha: I can do it to six people.
Taliesin: So we've got, one, two, three, four. I'll say yes.
Laura: And Grog.
Marisha: And Grog. And we're going to do a Mass Cure Wounds. 3d8 plus my spellcasting ability. Okay.
Matt: Yep, so 3d8 plus six. Go for it. Percy, you're up next.
Marisha: Oh my god, that's amazing. Oh, that's a one.
Sam: You can reroll ones.
Marisha: No, only if it's elemental damage. Eight, 16, 17 plus six.
Matt: Six, so 23.
Marisha: 23 points.
Matt: 23 points of healing. So mark that in, guys. That's your action.
Marisha: And then I'm backing out a little bit.
Matt: Backing this way or this way?
Marisha: Yeah, away from the chain golem. Yeah. That way.
Matt: This way. If you move one more, he's going to get attack of opportunity on you because you're within melee range of him right now.
Marisha: Fucking hell.
Matt: You want to risk it? Or not?
Marisha: Yeah, I'll risk it.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can you transform anymore or are you spent?
Marisha: I can do it one more time, but only to an animal, not an elemental.
Matt: Okay, so you back up. It takes a swing at you with its chain slam. That is 26 to hit.
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: You take--
Sam: Is Sanctuary still on her?
Matt: 30 points of bludgeoning damage.
Taliesin: Sanctuary.
Laura: Sanctuary.
Matt: Sanctuary. Thank you for reminding me. That is a 14.
Marisha: Miss!
Matt: What's your DC? 17?
Sam: On what? My spell DC?
Matt: Yeah, spell DC.
Sam: 17.
Matt: 17. It goes to swing again towards you as a reaction and the magic prevents it from actually hitting its mark and the chains retract back into its body.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: So no damage is sustained.
Sam: Matt, if I may be--
Laura: No.
Sam: Technically, he can choose another target.
Marisha: Are you going to be honest?
Laura: Oh, because he failed?
Sam: No, it just says in Sanctuary you can either fail or he can choose another target.
Matt: That's true. All right, so instead--
Sam: Sorry. Just saying.
Matt: No, that's good. It'll go to Tova and Vax for the two attacks that he got Sanctuary earlier. So to Vax, that is a 31.
Liam: No, that does not hit.
Matt: So you take the 30 points of damage instead.
Marisha: You're taking it for me?
Liam: Yes, I am.
Marisha: Thanks, boyfriend!
Matt: Against Tova that is a natural one.
Noelle: That's a what?
Matt: Natural one to hit you. So it actually slams into the door above.
Laura: Does it break through the door?
Matt: I'll make a strength check now.
Liam: Happy to.
Matt: The door cracks and it partially gets pushed inward. Somehow the chain golem actually helped you out. That's interesting. All right. That ends its turn. Keyleth, you're up. No, sorry, that was Keyleth's turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm out of its range now.
Matt: You are currently just out of its range.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to back up a bit. Move me behind that-- and then move me-- the other pillar.
Matt: Oh, this way?
Taliesin: Head that way. Does it look like those chains are feeding it?
Matt: It doesn't look like it's feeding it more than just the chains are keeping it attached to the walls. The mass of the chains are still in its chest.
Taliesin: And it has eyeballs.
Matt: It has some sort of two glowing light sources within the mass of chains that form where its head would be--
Taliesin: Would a headshot to those eyeballs actually be a thing that might work?
Matt: You can try it.
Taliesin: I'm going to try it. I'm going to burn a thing and see if that does it. So. Yeah. Let's find out.
Matt: You're up next, Grog.
Taliesin: Right. Yeah, that'll do. 32 to hit.
Matt: 32 hits.
Taliesin: All right. That's a d10 and d6. That's 11 points of damage and three points of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And it has to make a constitution saving throw.
Matt: It does not, actually, because it's not affected by that effect. Its eyes can shift throughout its body.
Taliesin: There's no snapping, breaking the glass?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: Man, you made me burn a Grit. That sucks.
Matt: Yeah. Even with its spell advantage against all those Sanctuary saves, it just doesn't have a very high wisdom so it just cannot make it.
Taliesin: That's okay. I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot at it and just keep damaging it. I'm going to do a sharpshooter shot.
Matt: Two more. Go for it.
Taliesin: That was shot one.
Matt: Shot one. You have two more.
Taliesin: Shot two. That's a 25.
Matt: Hits.
Taliesin: That's, ooh. 27 points of damage. And five psychic.
Matt: Nice. 32, all righty. Last attack.
Taliesin: And another shot, same thing, sharpshooter. Fuck.
Marisha: Yeah, that's cocked.
Sam: You have too many dice on there.
Taliesin: I never do. (groans) Could be worse. 14.
Matt: 14? Okay.
Taliesin: Does 14 hit?
Matt: 14 does not hit. Sorry, thought that was the damage. Sorry.
Taliesin: Okay. And then I'm going to stay in but keep an eye on everything that's happening.
Matt: Yeah. All right. Keyleth, by the way, as you were moving through the chains-- I forgot to mention earlier, as the tangling chains around it. You did suffer five points of bludgeoning damage as the chains are just swirling around and the aura and the area of its vicinity just shreds like a slow-moving grinder.
Marisha: As I move out?
Matt: You're still in there.
Marisha: But I healed? Okay. So I'm at 60 points, right?
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Laura: Get it, Grog.
Travis: Where am I on the map?
Matt: Right there.
Laura: Ooh, perfect.
Travis: Yeah, door-- smash it open, right?
Matt: All right, go for it. Roll an attack.
Travis: Crack of doom. 23.
Matt: 23 hits.
Travis: What do I roll?
Matt: Just roll damage for your hammer.
Travis: Oh yeah, that makes sense, right? Nine. 25.
Matt: 25 damage? Becomes 50 because of siege. The door is absolutely sundered and comes off. Oh god. As the door blows open, you glance inside. You can see within the walls are covered in pulse-y, fleshy, muscle-like substance with these long stretched tendons and pieces of sinew that all gather to the center, and you see this shifting larval egg. And within, you can see a small humanoid figure that is swirling and writhing within. It seems like it's in this perpetual state of agony, screaming quietly within this weird fleshy egg sac and you can see the features of a tiger-like face and fangs writhing inside.
Marisha: Fucking, umbilical cord.
Travis: I have one more hit. I'll stride forward and swing away.
Matt: Okay. As you step forward, the chain golem already used its reaction so it cannot. You just walk forward. Make an attack.
Travis: Reckless, please.
Laura: Because why not.
Travis: Because why not. That's a million. It's 32.
Matt: Roll damage.
Laura: A million.
Taliesin: Million.
Travis: 22.
Matt: (impact noise) It just (explosion) spattered across the ground. What was once shifting is now a fine red cream as the true form of Hotis, partially returned, is now scattered across the steaming pavement of the depths of the Mentiri prison. The devil is no more. You are free from the curse. (cheering)
Matt: Now just to get out of here, because you hear the voices in the distance now getting--
Laura: Now we just have to Plane Shift.
Noelle: What is happening?
Laura: Is it done?
Travis: No. How much movement do I have left?
Matt: That was you. Because of the chains wrapping around you-- which, by the way, did five points of bludgeoning damage to you.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: It takes you half movement to move through that space so that's five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. So you can move two more squares.
Travis: Two more squares. I'll come back out the door and towards Keyleth.
Matt: All right. That'll get you about there. And that's as far as you can get. The chains are tangling you up and preventing you from moving quickly. Ending Grog's turn. Taryon.
Sam: I mean, we're done.
Laura: Get to Keyleth. We have to be touching her.
Sam: I'll move to Keyleth and say  Tova, are you coming with us? You have to, sort of.
Noelle: Where are you going?
Sam: To another plane of existence. But one without chain golems trying to kill you.
Noelle: I can't. I can't leave my friends. I have to try and find them.
Sam: How?
Noelle: I don't know.
Sam: I'll go next to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay. So you step in next to her over the grate.
Sam: I can make you invisible. I can make you fly. What would help you get out of here?
Noelle: I'll have that invisibility.
Sam: Sure.
Noelle: Invisible bear?
Matt: As Tova vanishes in the moment, and is this slight ripple in the air.
Taliesin: Oh, you have a slight ripple figure. Phantom bear.
Laura: Does he?
Matt: There is where you are. Tova's form vanishes.
Noelle: How long does that last?
Sam: A minute.
Noelle: Thanks.
Sam: Just one minute. (laughter)
Travis: Run real fast.
Laura: And the minute you take damage, you become visible again?
Matt: Invisibility lasts an hour.
Sam: It lasts an hour?! Oh! Hey, you can get out with that.
Noelle: Going to try and do that.
Marisha: Get out.
Travis: She's like  okay, I've got to get-- (poof)
Matt: All righty. Vex.
Laura: All right. I'm going to run forward and try to get to-- I'm going to poof Trinket in and run forward and try to get to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay. Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. That's as far as you can get, right there. Make a double dash?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. 25, 30. That's as far as you get, and you take eight points of bludgeoning damage from the chains that are whipping around you and wrapping around your legs and tying you up as you're reaching forward. It's like this swamp of grinding metal. That ends your turn. Tova. You're invisible. If you do any attacks, you lose invisibility, so either you're going with them, or you're retreating into the prison for better or for worse.
Noelle: Can I run over, pick up Vex, and carry her over to her friends? 45.
Sam: Is Vex down?
Noelle: No. She can't move any more.
Sam: Oh. (laughs)
Matt: 35, 40. You get right up next to her, right there. She's light enough. You lift her up, and you make a dash action to bring her over for half speed.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: 15, 20. You get her just there, within range of Keyleth.
Laura: I'm so confused.
Noelle: You just got carried by an invisible bear!
Matt: You take five points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half because you're in your bear form, so you take two points of bludgeoning damage.
Laura: I feel very nostalgic for some reason as she's doing this. This is very comfortable for me.
Matt: The golem's turn now.
Laura: Oh god. Am I on the ground again? Did you put me down?
Noelle: Yeah, I put you down.
Laura: Okay.
Noelle: I mean, unless you want to be airplaned up by an invisible bear.
Laura: I mean, I'm not opposed, but.
Matt: The golem is going to make a chain prison attack.
Travis: A chain prison?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: He's really going to just try to kill us before we can get out of here.
Matt: It's going to-- let's see here. It's going to get Percy, Keyleth, and Taryon.
Sam: Oh, shitballs.
Matt: I need you guys to all make dexterity saving throws.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, that's good, Gil!
Sam: I'm feeling lucky. Thank god. 20.
Matt: 20? That's exactly what you needed.
Marisha: 19 plus four, 23.
Matt: Percy?
Taliesin: It's a dex saving throw, and 20 is what we need? I'm going to use a resolve and see if I can make this work.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Nope. Same thing. 17.
Matt: 17. So everyone else, you guys both manage to break free. Percy, you are restrained.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: Gods damn it.
Matt: As the chains swirl up and wrap around your legs and torso and you find yourself bound in place.
Taliesin: Can we make a chain?
Laura: If we make a chain, we can reach over to him.
Marisha: Oh my god, like Guardians of the Galaxy, you guys?
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: Keyleth, your turn.
Marisha: I'm holding my turn and reaching out and trying to make this chain as much as I can.
Matt: You're going to begin casting the spell and holding the release of it until?
Marisha: As soon as everyone links hands, we're out.
Matt: At the start of your turn, you take nine points of bludgeoning damage from the chains that are swirling around you.
Marisha: That's fine. Can I do a bonus action to heal-- who's looking rough?
Laura: You. Heal yourself.
Taliesin: You.
Laura: Just heal your-fucking-self.
Marisha: Okay, I'm at 59 hit points. I'm going to heal myself.
Matt: So 2nd-level Healing Word? 1st-level?
Marisha: Yeah. 2nd-level. That's four plus another three.
Matt: So seven plus six. 13. You heal 13, and you begin casting Plane Shift. You pull out of your side satchel the tuning fork that you have attuned to where? Where are you going to be casting this towards?
Marisha: 73. Sorry, 73 hit points.
Matt: What location are you shifting towards, Keyleth, as you begin the spell?
Marisha: Home. Whitestone. Exandria.
Matt: Focusing on Whitestone in Exandria, you begin to cast the incantation. You see the power in her hands begins to glow, but she's holding it back. She's concentrating hard.
Marisha: And I just take whatever leftover action I have to be like, Vox Machina, come on!
Matt: All right, ending your turn, Keyleth. Percival, what are you doing?
Taliesin: I'm going to try and break out of this chain.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Taliesin: Goddamn it.
Travis: You've got this.
Sam: Natural 20. Golden snitch.
Taliesin: Strength check or strength save?
Matt: Strength check.
Taliesin: 14.
Matt: 14. You can't break the chains. They're too strong.
Taliesin: Can I use an action surge to try and do it again?
Matt: Yeah, because you get two now, at this level.
Taliesin: Yep, I've got one more.
Marisha: Come on, Percy.
Taliesin: (sighs) Nope.
Matt: Can't break free. The chains are holding you in place. Ending your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Who's the one who's back there?
Laura: That's Vax. He can dash.
Travis: Okay. Yeah, I would like to move towards Percy.
Matt: All right, at the start of your turn, Grog, you take seven points of bludgeoning damage from the swirling chains.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Reduced to three.
Travis: I'm not raging.
Matt: So that's five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. What's that?
Laura: He's not raging.
Matt: 50. You get right there.
Laura: Tary and Grog can hold hands in that position, right? He can reach Tary and Percy?
Marisha: We just need a chain.
Matt: No, Taryon is right here.
Laura: Yeah, so can he reach his hand out and have Percy and Tary?
Matt: Everyone would need to shift one more in that direction, or someone can plug that hole.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Do I need to break your chains or just touch you?
Taliesin: Just touch will work.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: That's true.
Travis: All right. I just grab your hand, and I'll lean back like this.
Laura: Oh yeah, he's super tall. Can he reach farther because he's super tall?
Liam: I saw my sister get picked up and put down, so I know where invisi-bear is, and I'm going to push through and feel along my sister's shoulder and feel were-bear's arm and say: You're in the middle of hell. This is a Ring of Invisibility. Thank you-- and push through, and I'm going to try to use my bonus to push all the way through and fill that gap.
Taliesin: You may have to throw the knife.
Matt: You can just barely, with the chains that are around you-- which by the way, Vax, you take eight points of bludgeoning damage. You can just get up to put the ring into Tova's hand, and that's as far as you can get.
Liam: I have an action and bonus action. Can't I use the bonus action to dash?
Matt: You can, actually.
Laura: Please, please, please.
Noelle: Come on, guys. Get out of here.
Laura: Please, just let him get there!
Matt: 25, 30. You're not quite there.
Liam: All right, well, I grab Keyleth's hand and we're going to work on closing this gap.
Matt: Well, you dashed with your bonus.
Liam: My action wasn't to give her the ring?
Matt: So yeah, you feel for her. That's your turn.
Marisha: Can you throw your dagger and hit me?
Liam: I'm out.
Marisha: You can't do anything else. You can't hit me?
Sam: No problem, guys.
Laura: We've just got one teeny little gap here, and whose turn is it?
Matt: All right, that brings us to Vex.
Laura: That's me?
Matt: Well, technically Taryon.
Sam: Oh. Me? I'm right there, aren't I?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Can I bridge the gap somehow?
Liam: Can he yank Vax?
Matt: You can use your action to try and pull him over.
Sam: To pull Vax over?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Fill the hole.
Matt: You do take seven points of bludgeoning damage from the chains.
Taliesin: Oh god. Stress.
Sam: Okay, great. Seven points. Okay, yeah. I'll reach like I've never reached before, and say: We're brothers forever. Lifelong teammates. Friends.
Taliesin: Out, out. Go, go!
Marisha: You fucking ass. Goddamn it!
Matt: You pull him into the space. Everyone grabs hands.
Laura: Oh, not you.
Matt: You see Tova's form appear briefly as she puts the ring on and then vanishes once more. You see the rest of them grab arms together. Keyleth, you finish the spell, Plane Shift.
Noelle: I'll look you up if I make it out of here alive.
Marisha: Please!
Liam: The ring's a loaner!
Noelle: We've still got to get that beer.
Sam: Greystone Keep! Get my robot!
Matt: You can see the chain golem swelling as the chains are feeding it. It's growing larger in the chambers, its red eyes getting brighter and brighter. As you all clasp hands together, the light flashes a bright whitish-green. There's a high-pitched whine just as you hear devils rushing in from across the hallway. (whoosh) Silence. And that's where we'll pick up next week. (groaning)
Laura: Holy shit.
Liam: You've got to live, Tova. You've got to live!
Noelle: I'll do my best.
Matt: Holy shit.
Noelle: I'm doing great.
Travis: Oh my god, Matthew!
Matt: Thank you guys. Oh shit.
Liam: You've got to Bilbo Baggins your way out of that shit!
Noelle: I'm in a much better position than I was to start with.
Laura: Holy crap.
Matt: Let's just hope Tova doesn't come across another pit fiend, because they can see through invisibility.
Sam: Five minutes later, Tova was killed. (laughter)
Matt: There are devils that can see through invisibility.
Noelle: I'm sure it will be fine.
Matt: I'm sure you'll be fine. It'll be great.
Sam: Worst case scenario, she ends the day where she started.
Laura: That was a really fun episode. That was a really fun game.
Matt: That was awesome, guys.
Laura: I feel like that was the most fun that we've had in a while.
Travis: Chain golems, all the demons.
Laura: I'm so tired!
Matt: It was fun. Guys, well done.
Marisha: We made it out, right?
Matt: Noelle, thank you so much for playing with us.
Noelle: This was fucking awesome.
Matt: Such a blast. Good sticking to the guns and staying behind. I was like, I don't know what she's going to do about this. Thinking you were going to find a way to find them.
Noelle: Yeah, and then I just keep showing up every week. You can't get rid of me. (laughter)
Matt: It's happened before. Our story ended up keeping Rothfuss here for three or four weeks in a row. It was supposed to be just a one-night thing.
Noelle: I had a mission.
Matt: He got a killing blow on a boss, too. We've had two guests get killing blows on a boss.
Marisha: We've had good themes of guests killing bosses.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Because Mary killed the white dragon.
Matt: That's true. You guys have got to pick up your slack.
Liam: Maybe your ghost can haunt us. "Remember when you left me in hell?"
Laura: Good times.
Noelle: Or it'll just be me with the invisibility ring.
Matt: Thank you so much for coming and playing with us, Noelle.
Noelle: Thank you for having me. This has been awesome.
Matt: Yay. So guys, once again, you can check out Noelle. If you want to pimp your stuff real fast before you leave? Nimona!
Marisha: Look at that! And Lumberjanes!
Sam: And Lumberjanes.
Noelle: And Lumberjanes. And other things soon to be revealed.
Matt: Yeah, I'm excited. Well, thank you again. Guys, awesome job. We'll pick this up next week, and we'll see you guys then. Until then, is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. I think we're recording, because my camera light's not on, but nevertheless, welcome. (laughs)
Travis: We're totally recording.
Matt: I'm pretty sure we are. Anyway guys, welcome, we have a fantastic guest who will be joining us later this evening, but before we get to that we have announcements to go over real fast. First and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by a new sponsor, a fantastic group called Quidd! If you want to talk about that first?
Sam: Hi, guys. Vacation Sam here. Quidd is our sponsor tonight, a fantastic new sticker app for your phone. You can check it out at bitly, that's bit.ly/crquidd. I didn't know much about the company, but Quidd sounded vaguely British, so little-known fact about me, I have access to the BBC archives at home, so I did some snooping and sure enough, I found a World War II newsreel transcript that talked about Quidd, so I thought I would do a dramatic reading of it for you right now.
Liam: Here we go.
Sam: News from the front! This is Nigel J. Creamhutch reporting from BBC London. March 23, 1944 may be a turning point in WWII as PM Churchill announces a new weapon in the fight against those devilish Nazis. They're calling it Quidd, a new app where you can collect stickers, cards and Funko figures on your telephone device. Our lads on the frontlines are already using it! We spoke with Lieutenant Neville Bingham of the Royal Navy. Right, yeah, Quidd's this free app available on the Apple App Store and Google Play, and it's helping us drive Hitler back to Berlin. But it's not just our Tommies. The Reds have discovered Quidd as well! We spoke with tank commander Ivan Bashenko. With Quidd, Russian army is strongest in world. Morale better now with thousands of stickers to collect that can be used like emojis in messages to your friends. Stalingrad will not fall with these cute stickers! Why, they're even using Quidd across the pond! We spoke with American sergeant John Smith, an American Doughboy. I'm John, an American. We American GIs love to collect stickers from brands like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, Breaking Bad, Star Trek, and newly announced Game of Thrones. Take that, Emperor Hirohito! Well, there you have it, ladies and gents. Your British Armed Forces and our allies will defeat the Nazis and win the Second Great War if you go to bit.ly/crquidd and check out Quidd. Good night, good luck, and god save the queen, pip pip! (cheering)
Travis: I'm so glad that's available on the BBC.
Sam: Yeah, it was a weird transcript. I would have shown the newsreel, but it was just a transcript.
Matt: Fair enough. Well, thank you for the update on that, and thank you, Quidd for sponsoring tonight's episode. Really appreciate it.
Liam: Did they win the war?
Sam: Find out next time! (laughter)
Matt: All righty, let's see. Do you have any merch updates at all, Laura?
Laura: There's stuff in the store!
Matt: There you go. Perfect. Good, I like it, thank you. The Green Ronin Campaign Guide. Pre-orders go up on Monday, guys!
All: What!
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Yes, and if you get the book and the pdf, I think the pdf is available immediately, so some of you will have access to actually read the book on Monday.
Laura: Are you so nervous, Matt?
Matt: I'm so nervous. (laughs nervously)
Taliesin: People can actually, in real time, call us when we're wrong on our own stuff.
Travis: What do you mean, finally? They do that every week.
Marisha: Finally? Although you are Taliesin Jaffe.
Taliesin: This is a level of pain I've only dreamed of; I'm very excited.
Liam: Hey. We're so proud of you.
Travis: Yeah, nice job with the words and stuff.
Sam: Hold on though, we haven't read it yet. What if it's terribly written, by a child?
Laura: We'll find out he used crayon. It's all written in marker.
Matt: Probably. Do you know how hard it is to get crayon printed these days?
Marisha: Only if the writers' room dropped the ball.
Matt: Well, I hope you guys enjoy it, so look forward to that. The podcast is now episodes 11 through 20, right? Up on the Apple Store. So you can go ahead and download those, which are awesome.
Marisha: Yep, Apple and Google Play.
Matt: Yes. And those are the ones. Of course we'll have Talks Machina next Tuesday at 7:00pm about this episode tonight, here on Twitch and Alpha, 7:00pm Pacific, with our fantastic host Brian Foster, so you can check that out. Wednesday Club next week for you?
Taliesin: Wednesday Club, we're talking about Comic Con, because Comic Con is coming up, and we're going to try and give you a first-timer's guide to Comic Con: If you've never been to one, what to expect, what to do for fun, and all sorts of things that you could see or do in San Diego. Other than us. Thank you, I was very proud of last night.
Matt: We're not having a show next week, we're going to be at Comic Con. Yeah, we have a week off. So we'll miss you guys next week, but we do have our Critical Role panel on Saturday at Comic Con, it's at 10:30am in Room 6...
Travis: BC... E.
Matt: It's a nice big room. You guys should come, we're going to have silly questions, Q and A, conversations, stories and a lot of funness and some cool surprises!
Sam: Prizes?
Taliesin: Prizes?
Matt: Surprises!
Marisha: Oh yeah, we have some announcements.
Matt: So hopefully you guys can make it at San Diego Comic Con. If you're going to be there we'd love to see you. And last but not least, Sagas of Sundry: Dread. The third episode went up today.
Matt: (perfect unison) Shit's getting real.
Marisha: (perfect unison) Shit's getting real.
Matt: I'm going to marry you. (laughter)
Matt: What's that? Oh that's right, and at GenCon next month we have our live show, we mentioned it last week. Tickets are still on sale for the general admission. We're looking forward to having you guys there, it's Friday evening.
Travis: Yeah, it's Friday evening, 7 30. In fact, we got an even bigger theatre this year. The last theatre had 1,500 seats, we're like, oh, we'll never get that many people, and it went (explosion sound). It filled up, so we got a 2,500 seat theatre. It's massive, it's a huge party, if you didn't join us last year, you want to come to this mayhem. It's so much fun. You don't need passes to GenCon, by the way, you don't have to have a badge or anything for that, it's a standalone thing. There are definitely tickets still available, it's going to be super fun.
Sam: I feel like with that many people we should have beach balls in the audience, and they can do the wave.
Matt: Inflatable d20s to throw out there...
Marisha: (gasps) You can get them. They're on ThinkGeek I think.
Matt: This is a terrible idea.
Travis: It's a great idea!
Matt: Anyway, without further ado, I think that concludes our announcements, and as such, let us dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So where we left off last time. Vox Machina, having finally encountered the Undying King, returned in physical form in the Shadowfell, did battle and fled, quite unprepared for that venture, and gathered some tidbits of information about what Vecna's plans may be. Upon returning and discovering that your disintegrated Vax has returned through some deal he made with his patron the Raven Queen after disintegrating, you decided to go ahead and try and gather more information about this and beseech some of the higher powers within Exandria. Pike talked to Sarenrae and was given the invitation to come visit her in Elysium on the Island of Renewal, and upon gathering your materials and causing a mess in Vasselheim, you got together and went to meet this fantastic Everlight. On her island, you spoke with her. She gathered some information from you, as Vecna seemed to be blocking at least the influence and vision from a lot of the deities, and then gave her blessing unto Pike, transferring you over to one of the other gods that lives among the Blessed Fields of Elysium: Pelor, the Dawnfather. You then walked through the orchards that led to the Fortress of the Sun where he resides, spoke with some of the guardians there, and were led into the center of the citadel, where you met, in the central throne room under the Zenith Tower, Pelor himself. Upon exchanging information, you spoke of your need to gather the favor of certain gods in the battles to come, and were given a challenge. To step up to plate: Vex'ahlia. You accepted the challenge and racing to the top of the tower, the zenith, before the fires could be extinguished in the brazier that awaited you, you threw yourself into the fire, and upon the party speaking on what it was that made Vex'ahlia such an important member of not just your team, but your family, and gave you strength, she was imbued with a blessing of the Dawnfather himself. After which, we left off as you exited the front of the Fortress of the Sun, stepped into the central glade that marks the center of the seemingly endless orchards that surround this region, and Vox Machina, what would you like to do?
Travis: Eat all of the fruit.
Laura: No.
Travis: It was really good. It was just fruit, by the way. Like I said.
Sam: We're still in heaven right now?
Laura: We're still in Elysium.
Taliesin: It's not quite heaven.
Travis: Are there any other gods here that we should curry favor with? For? Of?
Laura: Are there any more gods here? Not that we know of.
Sam: We forgot to ask.
Travis: Did we?
Laura: Yeah. I don't think Ioun is here.
Matt: You're looking at the series of the Sun Tree cousins, one of which you've met, scattered amongst this glade surrounding the central citadel.
Marisha: What a douche.
Sam: No other people? Guards? Nothing.
Matt: You have the guards behind you, the large planetar and deva entities that stand there, armored in their golden plate, after ushering you out, are standing guard.
Laura: Maybe we can ask them.
Sam: Sure. I'll go up to one and say, hello there, big fellow.
Matt: Standing a full ten feet taller than you, practically, the wings slightly bent, the large planar entity kneels down. "Hello."
Sam: Hello. Vacation Scanlan here. Couple questions. By the way, was he one of the ones who fought in there?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh. Do they all look alike? 17 plus one.
Matt: Hard to tell. You didn't pay a lot of attention.
Sam: Okay. Hey, just wondering, a few questions. A: How does one get out of here? Is there a door to another plane?
Matt: "I imagine the same way you came in."
Sam: A god brought us here. All right, cool. Number two: Are there any other like your Dawnfather around here? Any other gods in the area?
Matt: "Across Elysium, there are two deities that call it home: the Dawnfather and the Everlight."
Sam: So we covered our bases. Out of curiosity What are you called?
Matt: He looks very closely, and you get sense that part of its nature is scanning through you; it's getting a sense and a read of you as an individual, and it says, "No one you need to worry about." Stands up and then takes two steps back (heavy footfalls) into place and looks straight ahead.
Marisha: Scanlan, you should remember that line, that's a good one.
Sam: Yeah. I already forgot it. I'm too intimidated. Was it no one or something? I don't know. Well, good speaking to you.
Matt: Still looks out. Doesn't respond.
Sam: Well, how do we get out of here? Can she take us home?
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: She does on the daily.
Sam: I know, but I don't know. They talked about some sort of a gate that keeps the gods out and the bad gods in.
Matt: To remind you of what happened last time. There was talking about possibly... or at least there was the Trammel, the Prime Trammels that were used previously to seal the Chained Oblivion, Tharizdun, and that the orchestrator, the designer of those was Ioun, the Knowing Goddess. Ioun, however, has sealed herself away, being a wounded god, long recovering, and the only information that Pelor has of where she hid herself, the key, essentially, is not an object but a person. You're seeking an individual, of which you were given a solar light map of a single small home in a forest ravine not far from a place that you've noticed was near the Pools of Wittebak, which is in the Cliffkeep Mountains.
Sam: Yeah, but there was also a mention of some Divine Gate that keeps people from--
Matt: Well, the Divine Gate is a known existing entity. It's essentially a large gate that prevents the gods from returning to the Prime Material Plane.
Liam: It's like a metaphysical screen door that keeps flies out.
Laura: So the gods can't get in and out.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Marisha: Yeah, the Prime Trammel. Which we now have to get--
Laura: We have to get near the the Cliffkeep Range, near the Pools of Wittebak, is where we need to go.
Marisha: And the Cliffkeep is not too far from Whitestone?
Matt: Cliffkeep Mountains go across a lot of the northern side of Tal'Dorei, from what you're familiar with. Like, we're talking Kraghammer to Gatshadow to the Jorenn Village. There's a lot of things. It's like a big horizontal mountain range that caps the top part of the continent.
Marisha: Do I recognize the city that I can get us to that's close?
Matt: Fort Daxio or Kraghammer.
Sam: Haven't been to Kraghammer for a while, although Daxio might be worth a check.
Taliesin: What's closest to the pools?
Matt: Probably Terrah or the Pools of Wittebak. Those are the two that are closest.
Laura: What is Terrah?
Marisha: My home.
Matt: Terrah's not your home.
Marisha: Sorry. Sorry, Terrah is the Earth Ashari.
Sam: My other home, summer home.
Matt: The home away from home.
Liam: Can you also remind me where my Vecdar made me feel Vecna-- where on the Prime Material Plane?
Matt: Yes. Oh, where?
Liam: Yeah, we talked about it, but I can't remember.
Matt: You did, yes. It seemed to be hundreds of miles northwest of Vasselheim. You didn't sense any movement, but you knew the general direction and distance.
Liam: And that was yesterday.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: Teacher?
Matt: Yes, Laura?
Laura: I was excited the last game and somehow have misplaced my Pelor champion piece of paper.
Liam: Oh, she doesn't get to have it now. That's how that works.
Laura: I don't know how it happened! It's not with my stuffs.
Matt: That's okay, I remember what it does, and if you decide to use it--
Laura: You'll tell me? Okay.
Matt: I won't tell you. You tell me you want to use it.
Laura: Oh shit, okay. I'm sorry. I had it, and it's not here.
Taliesin: It's weird how he's so nice and yet it still feels like you are in so much trouble.
Laura: I'm in a lot of trouble, you guys.
Liam: He's calm, but indifferent. Like the Dawnfather.
Matt: All right, so what would you like to do?
Travis: Yeah, what would we like to do?
Marisha: Should we go to Terrah? Check in with them, I guess, while we're there?
Taliesin: Seems prudent.
Marisha: And talk to Pa'tice.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: All right. We ready to go?
Taliesin: I'm very ready to go. This is lovely and everything, but I've had my fill.
Marisha: I will burn my 8th-level spell slot to Plane Shift us to Terrah.
Matt: To Terrah, all righty.
Marisha: Mind the gap.
Taliesin: What gap?
Marisha: Don't worry about it.
Travis: No effects from eating that fruit, right?
Matt: No, you didn't sense any effects from that fruit, at the moment.
Travis: Didn't remove a curse or anything?
Matt: No, you didn't. Nothing really caught you up to speed, in that.
Laura: Are we by those fruit trees again?
Matt: There are no fruit-bearing trees directly near you. The Sun Trees are around you. Further in they do, yes. All righty. Bringing up my notes on Terrah, since that's where you're going.
Marisha: Yeah, I should probably--
Laura: I'm so confused about the order of things. If we go to Ioun, and we don't have everything we need for this Prime Trammel, are we fucked? I know we need godly power in order to imbue them, right? Or something?
Liam: Either here or soon we need to sit and work this out.
Sam: What do we need to bring into the trammel?
Laura: Well, Pelor gave me this. Snap, snap, snap, zip. This. It's a stone and it's supposed to be strong enough to--
Liam: Power the trammel?
Laura: Part of it? Not all of it.
Marisha: We need to collect more, though, right? We have to get like eight or something.
Sam: Wait, it said that?
Matt: You weren't given any indication as to how many you needed.
Laura: But it did seem like this is not enough.
Marisha: Oh no, wait, Ioun was healing for eight centuries. That's where I got that number. Sorry.
Travis: I could do it, too. Five. Five stones of power.
Matt: All right, so as you complete your spell, Keyleth, you step through the base of the nearest tree, possibly the same one you spoke with earlier if you want to be a dick about it.
Marisha: Oh yeah! Let's walk through that asshole. That sounds worse for us. But fuck it.
Matt: All right, you aggressively stampede through the center of this one tree and emerge on the other side from one of the surrounding trees on the Terrah village. There are a number of these pseudo-petrified or dried-out large-trunk trees that seem to have slowly died off from the heavy tectonic shifts and small quakes that happen in this area, that have made a lot of the land unable to support large forms of plant life, or at least the trees that used to exist here. So you step out and emerge from the exterior of the village as it domes down into this small crater that you recall seeing before, where most of the village inhabits the central portion, and the village is there before you.
Marisha: What were the shard things called again?
Matt: The shard things?
Marisha: The things we need to collect?
Matt: There wasn't really a name for them more than they're small pieces of essence of the deity.
Marisha: So we need pieces of god.
Liam: Does the little seed of light given to my sister look anything like the little seed that Scanlan and Vax saw from riding the shadow creature in the sky?
Matt: No. In a sense that it's a small source of power of some kind, but what you saw there was maybe about that large on the platform. What she has is bead size.
Laura: Is it this size? Or this size?
Matt: Comparable to each. So you stand outside of Terrah. What are you doing?
Sam: What time of day is it? How tired are we?
Matt: Based on when you left, it would still be probably-- well, you were over in Vasselheim, which means it's getting dark, actually. I'd say with the way the sun has passed through the sky now, you've just gotten past dusk. There's still light in the sky, but it's going from oranges to purples to dark blues on the horizon, and you can see hints of firelight, torchlight and candlelight from within the actual city below.
Sam: Well, what are we going to need on this trip? Maybe we should get whatever supplies we need. Is it far? Are we going to become gas?
Travis: Are we going underground?
Marisha: Oh, to Terrah?
Sam: No, we'e in Terrah. But the next day, we're going to the--
Taliesin: To the pools.
Marisha: Do we want to stay the night here, then? I can't mist us right now. I'm tapped out. Camp here.
Laura: Vax? Can you sense Vecna? Is he still in the same place?
Liam: I can sense him?
Matt: You can sense him. He is, from your current location, thousands of miles from you.
Laura: Oh, hard to tell, then?
Liam: He's still really shitty, though.
Matt: Yeah, very heavy west-northwest direction from you, currently.
Sam: Well, sleep? Do we need to get any intel on where these pools are? Do we need anything?
Laura: We should maybe talk to the people of Terrah? It's not that late.
Marisha: Yeah, let's go. They have a spare room for us.
Travis: Are you the leader of all the people?
Marisha: I'm the leader of the Air Ashari and the Voice of the Tempest.
Travis: Is that a yes or a no? You don't have to fucking brag.
Marisha: No, there's four of us, and I'm one of the four.
Sam: Do you know the one who lives here?
Marisha: I do.
Sam: Then let's go see him or her. Or they.
Marisha: No, we can just go, like I was saying five minutes ago. Let's just go.
Matt: All right. So as you walk down into the village, a number of the guardians step out quickly, seeing an approaching party, however, recognizing Keyleth and her station immediately, turn into an escort that leads you to the center portion of the village.
Marisha: I request Pa'tice.
Matt: Quickly enough, they go and retrieve Pa'tice. You see the elderly form of the leader you've met before step out, the graying hair, the weathered dark skin tones, the long greens and brown leathers that drape off, showing hints of the knees and lower feet, the large walking staff that he carries at his side as he approaches and the headdress that seems to be a combination of thick twines and shale shards that have been woven in, steps forward. "Keyleth. An unexpected visit, most definitely."
Marisha: Kaitiaki.
Matt: "Kaitiaki."
Marisha: Pa'tice, I am so sorry for the late intrusion. We've just gotten back from the plane of Elysium, so we're a little tired. Yeah, we're fighting a god right now, well, more of like a demi-god, so have you heard of Vecna? Sorry, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. Do you have any food? Let's talk over dinner.
Matt: "We have food, yes. You are guests of Terrah. Please, we will provide whatever you require. Come, provide them a meal!" And he puts his hand out and they run off quickly.
Taliesin: I like that people just feed us. We show up, and there's food.
Sam: You've been used to that your whole life.
Taliesin: Not at home.
Sam: I have to sing for dinner. You just say--
Taliesin: Have you ever tried not singing for dinner?
Sam: Maybe I'll get more food.
Taliesin: You might!
Liam: You did have one year-ish where you were on the skids. You did your Prince and the Pauper bit for a little bit.
Taliesin: It's a big vague, but yes. I was on a boat for quite a while.
Travis: Oh my god, can we eat food? (laughter)
Matt: And quick as that, you guys make your way down. It's a modest meal, but it's a meal nonetheless. Mostly hunted creatures of the local mountainside, some dried beets and root.
Marisha: We always try to source locally.
Taliesin: Charmingly provincial.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Keyleth, perhaps you should let your people know that the world is in danger.
Marisha: So the world's in danger, as she said--
Sam: The waiter is like, what?
Liam: Runs out the door.
Marisha: Aw shit! I just induced panic.
Matt: Pa'tice, who's sat down with you, says quickly, "We have been made aware via the other Ashari that there is some danger possibly coming. We are awaiting word of what to do other than keep ourselves in a defensive position. We have to guard the rift, of course. But should there be a call to action, we'll do what we can. I'm unfamiliar with this Vecna, but whatever you plan, please be careful."
Marisha: (sighs) Okay. More than anything, I think I would want you all to be relief for the surrounding area and surrounding villages if anything disastrous were to happen. I know you have to guard the rift and that is insanely important and especially right now with someone like Vecna who could potentially abuse that. But if anything were to happen, I don't know if you could house extra people during a disaster.
Matt: "We are quite good at assembling makeshift and temporary lodging. The rock is our friend, if you will."
Marisha: Yeah, that's more, I think, what we would need.
Matt: "Of course, of course! Not a worry."
Marisha: Currently, Vecna is just north of Vasselheim, close to Pyrah.
Matt: "Have you asked Pyrah for aid, as well?"
Marisha: They've also been put on alert, but we have not personally been there yet since this has happened.
Matt: "Well. Good. They're closer. But we're happy to help if we can."
Marisha: Yeah. Thank you.
Laura: Things are happening very quickly. We just happened here first.
Matt: "We're happy to help. Where are you off to?"
Sam: The Pools of Wittebak.
Matt: "What brings you towards the Pools of Wittebak?"
Sam: You know this place?
Matt: "It is a series of poisoned wells and hulking, stupid giants."
Sam: Hulking, stupid giants?
Laura: Giants? At the pools?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: I thought it was something about gnomes there.
Matt: "It was once."
Sam: They grew. (laughter)
Laura: Is that something you can do, Scanlan?
Sam: I don't know. (laughs)
Matt: "They're geothermic large puddles across the mountainside. Various minerals being lifted up from the deep waters beneath the mountain. Heated, bubbling, boiling, steaming. But the giants moved in hundreds of years ago, stomped around, and ended up filling the entire subterranean gnomish city of Wittebak with fumes and poison. Killed most of them, and the rest fled to Kraghammer."
Liam: Do you all ever broach the area or do you just stay clear of it?
Matt: "Best to avoid, we have our own business to deal with. And it's 100 miles from here. It's not much of an issue."
Taliesin: And the pools are naturally poisonous?
Matt: "Well, some are toxic, some are not, but since the giants moved in and ruptured some of the natural formations, some of them have grown toxic or acidic, yes."
Marisha: Do you know if people still try to live there? We're looking for someone.
Matt: "If they are, they're foolish."
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: That's our kind of people.
Laura: Maybe the person we're looking for is a giant.
Marisha: Maybe.
Sam: Do you know what type of giant? We've seen a few types of giants. Do you know their make and model?
Matt: "The dumbest. Hill giants."
Laura: Hill giants.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "Easy to outsmart, difficult to outrun. They'll eat anything, even small little gnomes."
Laura: Seems like they ate a lot of them.
Sam: (laughing) I guess so.
Laura: Pasty, I have a question. Do you know anything about Ioun?
Matt: "I know of the name."
Laura: But not much.
Matt: "We're not the most devoted people."
Laura: I know.
Marisha: I saw that. (laughter)
Matt: "I can't imagine I'd have any information you wouldn't."
Laura: Okay. Just checking.
Matt: "My apologies."
Laura: This food is really good.
Matt: "Yes! Enjoy your meal!" And he gets up and walks away.
Taliesin: He was so officious.
Laura: I thought we were walking into a fucking lake with gnomes living there. I didn't realize we were going to fight giants.
Travis: This got so much better all of a sudden.
Taliesin: If it were easy, it really wouldn't be us, would it?
Marisha: So the question is, is there actually someone of some minor intelligence living there that is this magical key, or did that person get eaten by a giant?
Taliesin: I cannot believe I'm about to say this. I'm inclined to believe the god. They're in the position where trying to trick us out of leaving is not necessary. They could've just told us to leave and be done with it. That information just wouldn't suit them, I don't think.
Marisha: I'm not saying it's bad information, I'm just wondering who the key is.
Laura: It's possible the key is now inside of a giant's stomach. In which case, it still would be inside of someone. Just a different someone.
Marisha: Yeah. Maybe they're still living inside. Maybe it's like a Moby Dick situation.
Matt: You do recall the map that was shown to you by the Dawnfather Pelor. It was adjacent to the pools, not actually in the Pools of Wittebak. It was within a forest, and was a home.
Laura: Oh! I remember it now! It was a home inside. Oh, I drew a little map of it. Yep, that's it. Yes, it's adjacent to the pools, but there's a home in a forest. Did you like it? That's what my map was.
Marisha: Can we theoretically just mist over everywhere?
Laura: I mean and look out for a home in the forest? We'll have to fly pretty low. I'm assuming the home is going to be covered by treetop.
Travis: We never travel traditionally anymore. I'm just saying, I miss the romantic aspects of traveling the countryside. It's like fast forward, immediate gratification, fucking you know.
Sam: The Dawnfather said we must hurry or else the world will end.
Laura: It's very far. We could Misty Step to the forest and then walk in the forest?
Travis: Why are you fucking talking to me like I'm a child?
Laura: No reason, darling.
Travis: Okay. That would-- okay. (laughter)
Liam: Once this is all done, Grog, you and I will go on a long trek together.
Travis: Yeah? Yeah. I dig that.
Laura: Don't be dark and creepy and make it sound like you're being nice. I know you're being dark and creepy right now.
Travis: Oh, hey. Don't get after my camping partner like that, all right? Shit. Chill.
Liam: Can't predict this one.
Travis: No marshmallows for this witch.
Marisha: It is a little weird to be making promises, though.
Taliesin: Well, on that chipper little side note, I think we should turn in for the evening.
Sam: Yes, do we have lodging?
Matt: Lodging is provided for you. They have a number of various guest tents and small buildings that provide you with space. Not the highest of quality of places you've slept in, probably, and if you wanted to provide your mansion instead, you're welcome to, but ample food, quiet sleep. It's a comfortable evening's rest. You all find yourselves through the evening. As you sleep, and having this being the first time many of you have slept in Terrah, it takes you a while. There is just a general low hum or vibration to the ground that you sleep on. You get the sense it's probably proximity to the Rift, but there is this slow, perpetual (rumbling). It's like a weird, low rumble. Like a heavy bass sound that never seems to dissipate that you hadn't noticed until you were trying to quietly sleep. But it's not off-putting and within ten or 15 minutes, it actually almost helps to lull you to rest. You all come to in the morning, gather your supplies, and are preparing for the next leg of your journey. What do you wish to do?
Travis: Could I attune, either before I go to sleep or when I wake up, to the Dwarven Thrower instead of the Bloodaxe?
Matt: You may. All right. Any other attunements, anyone wishes to--
Liam: I'll set the Deathwalker's Ward to acid.
Matt: All right, to acid. Boom.
Laura: Before everyone else gets up, can I go find where Vax is sleeping?
Matt: You may.
Laura: This is a tent. What do I do? Do I knock? Do I shake it? I'm not sure. Scratch?
Matt: They're lodging made from large pieces of shale and rock, jammed into a somewhat triangular pattern to form an earth yurt, if you will.
Laura: Oi. Vax. Are you naked?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Put some clothes on, then. Jesus. Keyleth, sorry.
Marisha: Keyleth opens the shamble door first with a little earth movement. I'm dressed. Yeah. I'm not like that.
Laura: You don't sleep naked?
Marisha: I'm going to go get coffee.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: (laughs) Keyleth darts off in the distance and the two of you are left within the tent.
Laura: Are you decent?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: I'm coming in.
Liam: I'm still naked.
Laura: Ugh, come on! So fucking weird. (groans) I turn my back to him.
Liam: I start putting on the rest of my armor.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Laura: Can I ask you a question? Well, I'm going to.
Liam: Of course you can.
Laura: I look down at my feet. Why didn't you ever try to take these back?
Liam: Well, they're going to be yours, anyway.
Laura: Oh, Jesus. You know, the only reason I do things is that I take great joy in irritating you. If you don't show irritation, it makes it not worth it. (sighs) Can I turn around now? I'm turning around.
Liam: I am covered.
Laura: Good. Why are you so calm? You're so calm and confident now. It's weird.
Liam: I mean, I'm on bonus time.
Laura: Is he still cold?
Matt: His skin is colder than a warm body, yes.
Liam: But I'm not Bobby Drake, right?
Laura: What's his heartbeat like?
Matt: (very slow heartbeat)
Laura: (groans) Jeez!
Taliesin: Wow, way to hang onto that one, Matt.
Liam: But look. (slashing noise) I mean, look.
Laura: Is there blood?
Matt: Yeah, he bleeds, and it's a pretty open wound. You watch as the wound slowly seals itself up.
Laura: (gasping) No fucking way!
Liam: Oh, I didn't know it did that. (laughter)
Laura: That's really cool.
Liam: Thank you!
Laura: Wow.
Liam: I don't know, this is the dumbest conversation. This is bonus time. I shouldn't be here. It was the long sleep or come back and help.
Laura: So she gave you the option and then you came back and now you're what? Super? Super half-elf?
Liam: Well, I'm just following through on a promise made.
Laura: And we defeat Vecna and you're done, you're gone. That's it? Instant? Is it like we kill him and you're gone that second or is it like we kill him and you're here for another week or until the Raven Queen realizes that you're still here?
Liam: There isn't really a handbook.
Laura: She didn't tell you?
Liam: When Vecna is destroyed, she will call me back to where I would be right now. I expect everyone-- Keyleth and I have barely spoken-- I expect everyone to be sad, but I wish you wouldn't be so sad, not exorbitantly so, because I--
Laura: Exorbitant? That's a good word.
Liam: I read. Not as much as some, but I read. This is the path that I have chosen for myself and I did it based out of desperation, at first. But everyone dies.
Laura: I know.
Liam: And I think our group has become a little spoiled. We're not your ordinary group of idiots. We have blessings.
Laura: We're blessed idiots.
Liam: Blessed idiots, yes, and I know that we've gotten used to feeling like we can overcome losing anyone, but your average farmer or seamstress doesn't come back. And everybody dies, and all that matters is what you do with what you have, and I have done a lot, and I've taken great pride watching all that you have done. And I have good friends and I have fallen in love. More than most, I've had.
Laura: Yeah. After you die, do you stand by her side?
Liam: That I don't really know. I imagine she'll keep me close.
Laura: Do you like her now?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: That's good.
Liam: She's necessary and she's of use, and I like that.
Laura: She brought you back to us for a while. I like her, too. Anyway, do you want the fucking boots back? Fuck! Yeah, sure, yes, fine, that's fine. I wanted to give them back, so there you go. I'm glad you asked for them back.
Liam: I don't have a lot of time. They really are my favorite thing.
Laura: I know.
Liam: Physical thing.
Laura: Just make sure you write it down somewhere that after you go back to the Raven Queen that your sister is your favorite in the universe.
Liam: Dear, every stitch on my body is yours when I am gone.
Laura: I don't want every stitch. None of it's worth you leaving.
Liam: I slide my feet into the shoes and I wiggle my toes around. Oh, I'm sorry. I also have a confession to make.
Laura: What?
Liam: I don't exactly have your shoes anymore.
Laura: What?!
Liam: I think that I left them in the Feywild.
Laura: The Feywild?
Liam: Yeah, I think I dropped them into a bog. They didn't fit me.
Laura: You are a motherfucker. You couldn't have just put them in the Bag of Holding?
Liam: I'm still me.
Laura: Great, wonderful. I like being barefoot.
Liam: You have very cute, small feet that fit in the boots that you gave me that did not fit my feet.
Laura: That's great.
Liam: There's probably shoes here.
Laura: Probably. All right.
Liam: I pull out her shoes and I put them down.
Laura: Well, at least there's that!
Matt: Got your shoes back. Keyleth returns with some coffee. The rest of you come to consciousness, and the morning sun is now blaring down over the Cliffkeep. It's a strangely clear sky for the north. While a lot of it is relatively cold usually, you're used to seeing the snow- capped mountaintops-- oh, you found it! There you go.
Taliesin: It was with you the whole time.
Liam: Must have been inside your shoes.
Laura: Oh my gosh! I put it in the safe place and I didn't realize it!
Travis: Thank you, chat.
Laura: Did they really know where I put it?
Travis: Yeah, they know where your shit is.
Sam: The chat knew where you put your stuff?
Travis: "It's in the page in front of your blue divider."
Sam: No way!
Laura: Wow, thank you. Thank you, guys!
Liam: How many fingers am I holding up?
Matt: So bringing it back in, guys.
Sam: Yes, we have a guest.
Matt: Yes. At some point. So what do you guys want to do?
Sam: Set off! For the Pools of Hatabah! (laughter)
Taliesin: For the forest near the Pools of--
Sam: The adjacent to the Pools of Hatafah.
Travis: We didn't want to bring any extra muscle with us, do we, from these peeps? Oh wait, we're misting a long ways away. Never mind. Sorry. Forget it.
Liam: Grog, you are our extra muscle.
Travis: See! High five! Up top.
Liam: I'm not dead.
Travis: His hand's cold.
Matt: So you're traversing via your Wind Walk?
Marisha: I guess. Are we wind walking there?
Laura: (mispronouncing) Wind.
Marisha: (mispronouncing) Wind walk? Wind walking.
Liam: (mispronouncing) Wil Wheaton!
Sam: Hey, before we leave, real quick  Kiki.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: Can you send messages or anything?
Marisha: No, man. We have been through this with our entire group so many times.
Sam: It's just you're so powerful.
Marisha: Thank you.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: What do you need?
Sam: I would send a letter, but it'll take weeks. So forget it. We'll be somewhere close to somewhere with magic soon.
Marisha: We can leave it in the hands of the Ashari, see if they can find somebody.
Sam: You trust these folks?
Marisha: Yeah. They're all right.
Taliesin: They're not the worst.
Marisha: They're not the worst.
Sam: All right, I'll scribble a little note and say-- well, no, there's no way they can get it to-- it's too far! It's too far!
Taliesin: I was really excited to see your face when you handed it to them and they're like, what are we supposed to do with this?
Sam: Here, I'll show you, Grog.
Travis: Write it out, bitch!
Sam: I write, a sphincter says what.
Travis: A. As. Good message. That's a big word at the front.
Laura: You could have gotten the last one, though.
Travis: What!
Sam: Yes!
Matt: Pike taps you on the shoulder and is like, "I'll teach you that later."
Taliesin: Thank you for the Ashley Johnson simulator. That was weirdly comforting.
Matt: Curse you, Blindspot!
Travis: Yeah! Are we misting?
Sam: Yeah, let's do it.
Laura: Should we eat a feast first, or should we save that?
Taliesin: Let's save that.
Laura: Okay. I don't know what we're going to find!
Matt: That's up to you guys. So preparations being done, you gather your materials, Keyleth completes the Wind Walk spell and you all feel yourselves grow slightly lighter on your toes. You concentrate. Over the minute transformation, you turn into your mist forms and take off in what direction?
Marisha: Towards the Falafel Pools!
Sam: We wrote it down.
Taliesin: Falafel pool is actually really tasty.
Travis: Pools of Wittebak.
Laura: Yeah! Towards the mountains!
Sam: He said "which direction?" He did not say "Where are you going?" He said "which direction?"
Laura: We got to look at our map.
Marisha: We have it on the map!
Laura: We have a map!
Matt: Okay! Well, you have Terrah locked down. The Pools of Wittebak would not be on your specific map that you acquired earlier. You can ask around within Terrah within a brief time and figure it out. Somewhere between 100 and 120 miles, and he points in a specific direction. You mark the sun's traveling and where certain landmarks are.
Marisha: I quickly do the math of how fast I can travel and be like okay, it shouldn't take long.
Matt: It's an eastward direction from where you are.
Taliesin: You did actually, legitimately point east, too, which makes that even better.
Matt: That's weird.
Taliesin: Yeah, that is weird.
Matt: I'm putting points in my nature skill. Or survival, I guess. Anyway, too many editions in my head. (laughs) As you all take off into the morning sky, you begin to rocket over, and you're hitting jets of wind that are beginning to find their way over the mountain ranges, and you get blown a little off-course, but you maintain concentration as best you can in that direction. Who is leading this venture?
Sam: I've been there. No, I knew of it, right?
Matt: You knew of it, yeah.
Sam: But I don't know exactly where.
Laura: After listening to everybody, I'll lead the way. That way, I can keep an eye out for the forest next, too, and the house and all the things we're looking for. I got a good look at the map that Pelor held up in front of us, as well.
Matt: Right. Okay, cool. I need you to go ahead and make a survival check. Actually, for this, I'm gonna say-- yeah, because it would be tracking in the wilderness. So survival.
Laura: Survival? Great. Any advantage on that?
Sam: Wilderness is your favored terrain.
Matt: It's mountains, technically.
Laura: That's also my favored.
Matt: Then yeah, roll again.
Travis: Because that was a one.
Laura: Oh! So much better. 28.
Matt: Okay, that'll do it. Your speed is tremendous when in this form, so what would have been an extended trek on foot over a series of days, it takes you mere hours to eventually get to a point where you crest one heavy peak. On the opposite side, you can see down the cliffside, the edge reaches a slight precipice, and there you can see what looks to be for a mile or so a cluster of dozens and dozens of pools of water of different sizes, all jammed together in a geothermic cluster, where you can see bright greens that move to a deep orange-maroon at the edges from the various mineral deposits that have collected over hundreds and hundreds of years. You can see large columns of smoke and steam of different chemical colors rising out of various large pools, and at a glance down, you can see a number of shapes: a number of hulking, humanoid shapes; somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 or so scattered at different pools, moving in small clusters or gangs. Some of them are jumping in, cannonballing and swimming through the actual pools. Some of them are lounging around and lying. Some of them appear to be returning, dragging things from the nearby forest on the eastern side of the bank.
Marisha: This is a vacation spot. What's that water park nearby?
Laura: Wet 'N' Wild?
Matt: Essentially, for a few hundred years, you get the sense that the Pools of Wittebak have been a hill giant water park. You can see these large mounds of mud and scrap wood and things that have been built into these large hill giant domiciles onto the side of the mountain not far from the pools. It's become a definite hill giant wandering zone. So do you guys continue over the pools, down towards the nearby forest ridge?
Laura: Yeah, past the pools.
Matt: All righty. You come to the forest ridge, and you can see it's not thick forest. The ravine comes down off the precipice where the pools are. You get a few hundred-- I'd say, actually more than that. A thousand or more feet away from that precipice before plants even begin to grow. It looks like whatever toxic chemicals have burbled up in some of these pools have made a lot of the ground there unable to give any forest life or sustain any large trees. As soon as the forest begins, it's a dense little pocket, maybe a mile and a half, two miles across. That's what you've got. What do you guys want to do?
Laura: Oh man. I should try to track any footprints in there and see if there's something around the edges, maybe, that lead back to-- shit, I don't fucking know. It's only a couple of miles.
Matt: If you guys begin to do a loop-over, who's doing a quick pass over the patch of forest? All right, make a perception check.
Laura: It's the forest. Do I get advantage on that one? Perception? What is that, 21? 21.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: Okay. Glancing over, you don't see any major glades or clearings. There doesn't appear to be any sign of bastions of civilization or any sort of logging going on. There's no areas where trees have been cut or cleared. It's a featureless forest top, from what you can see.
Laura: Can we fly down lower to where we're in between the trees?
Matt: You can go down into the forest, if you'd like. All right, who's going into the forest, then?
Marisha: I'll go.
Laura: I'll go. All of us?
Matt: So with Pike following suit, you guys all swoop down through the boughs of the trees and into the center of the forest itself. Within there, it's not a super thick canopy; it's not as heavy as the Feywild or some of the recent forests that cluster around Vasselheim. There are breaks in the canopy where you can see the sunbeams come through from the morning sun that's rising up higher and higher in the sky as you've traveled. The mist has burned away in this area, so it's a nice, warm forest. Glancing about, there is a lot of life in here. You can see signs of squirrels. You rush by what was a family of wolverine-like creatures that are rustling by. As soon as the wind scoots in and your mist forms come rocketing past, they all scatter and run off into the shadows. There's a lot of forest ground here to cover. For you to really super track with advantage, you'd have to go into human form. I'd give you a regular roll if you want to try and track in your mist form.
Laura: Not so much tracking right now, just a loose passover as we're going, looking for any kind of hunting traps or trails, signs of life of things that have been traversed a lot.
Matt: I'd say make an investigation check.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27. Begin coasting through tree after tree through small, tiny bits of clearing that immediately come into large clusters of trunks and knotted branches that all merge and cluster at different intersections. After about 20 or so minutes of this, trying to do a large spiral around the forest inward, out of the corner of your eye, Vex'ahlia, you glance over and see a quick glimpse of something that appears to be more structured. You look back and rush over and there you see amongst the trees what appears to be a humble-looking two-story home. You see a small balcony built on the second floor that goes over one of the larger rooms in the bottom floor. It's not huge, by any means, and is hidden by a lot of the local brush and trees there. Can't get a lot more detail at this distance, though.
Laura: Okay. We land. I land.
Marisha: I follow.
Laura: And behind a tree, I'm going to take form.
Matt: You take your form? Okay. So all of you land and follow Vex?
Sam: Yeah!
Matt: You all take a minute to go back to your physical forms. You glance over, and there it is, standing before you. It's very shaded in this part of the forest. You can see a little bit of what looks to be interior light, very faint.
Travis: Like a normal person-sized dwelling?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Natural 20!
Laura: Yay!
Matt: It would be a little small for you, Grog. But you could walk in it. Proportionally, it looks maybe like it was built for a little bit of a smaller person.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: I want to start eyeballing the ground of the house for any kinds of traps set out. Is that investigation, yeah?
Matt: That is investigation.
Liam: 18.
Matt: 18. Okay. So you guys begin to slowly--
Travis: Wait. Before we do, there are no random nudist giants that have run over in this area, right? There's nobody sees us over here taking off?
Taliesin: You're worried about giants streaking?
Travis: Not particularly.
Taliesin: That was very specific.
Travis: Well, yeah, have you ever seen a giant naked? You'll never forget it.
Taliesin: I might. I don't know.
Sam: Are you suggesting we set up a perimeter?
Travis: Yeah! I mean, it's a tiny house, I don't really want to go in there. I like having exits I fit through.
Laura: I don't want whoever it is to think that we threaten them in any way. But then, if they threaten us, I wouldn't want them to attack us, either.
Travis: Yeah, I'll just knock the house down from the outside.
Taliesin: Let's keep this structure standing for now.
Travis: I'll stay outside.
Sam: Are we knocking properly or are we just going to Invisibility in and see who's in there?
Laura: I feel like maybe knock properly.
Taliesin: If you think long and hard about it, it's not like manners have failed us very often.
Laura: Yeah. But do keep an eye out for traps or anything weird on the way up.
Marisha: I think we've failed at manners often.
Taliesin: We fail at manners more often. We'll see how this goes. We'll try being nice.
Travis: I'll stay out here.
Sam: I'll go knock on the door. It seems like a smallish door, right?
Laura: Yeah, I'll go with you.
Matt: Okay, so what's the marching order?
Sam: I'll go first.
Liam: Nothing perked up my spidey-sense?
Matt: From this current glance, no. You guys are behind a tree at a distance.
Travis: No nude giants, right?
Matt: Currently, no, but you're keeping an eye out.
Laura: I'm walking with a smile, looking very friendly.
Matt: Who's leading the charge?
Sam: I'll go knock.
Laura: I'll walk behind Scanlan.
Matt: We have Scanlan and Vex'ahlia.
Liam: I'm going to go, as well, and continue to eyeball for traps.
Taliesin: I'll be hanging back a bit, as well.
Marisha: I'll be comfortably back, as well.
Sam: Before we knock, what were we told was in this thing?
Travis: The key.
Sam: The key. Inside a person, inside a house.
Laura: It's possible the person is the key; we're not sure.
Matt: Is Trinket within your necklace for this?
Laura: No, he's out.
Matt: Okay, Trinket is out alongside you. Grog?
Laura: He's a very friendly bear, look at him!
Travis: I'm outside the house.
Laura: Trinket, smile! Be friendly!
Matt: As you get across this small walkway towards the front, as you're walking with a big smile, Vex'ahlia, something catches your eye on the ground right before her and you watch as she steps forward. You reach out and grab her wrist and hold her back before she steps down.
Laura: What is it?
Matt: There is a large, rusted, iron bear trap that is open that you almost stepped right into.
Travis: That would be have been donesies.
Laura: I was being friendly, and it almost crushed me. Trinket, be careful, this thing was made for you.
Matt: Trinket walks up to it.
Laura: No, no, be careful! Spit on it!
Matt: (growling)
Laura: Can he spit? Can Trinket spit?
Matt: (bear spitting) It's not very-- it's more of a power drool, if you will.
Liam: Is it easy enough to walk around?
Matt: You can walk around that one, and you begin to see what looks to be seven other ones that are clustered around.
Taliesin: This is probably a giant-infested forest.
Marisha: Yes, that's exactly why. Bear traps are the biggest thing you can get for a giant.
Sam: Can we evade them and get into--
Matt: You begin to walk around. Yeah, you would, actually. As you step around one, you can see, at the front door, there is a welcome mat that says "welcome." As you're approaching it, you can see the welcome mat, there's just something a little off about it. Like, it's raised higher than the ground should be.
Travis: Willkommen.
Marisha: Trapped?
Liam: Well, I could attempt to dicker with it, but we could just knock the door over it if we really are going on manners.
Taliesin: Double-check to make sure the door isn't a problem, either. I'd imagine if the welcome mat is.
Liam: The door's going to blow up if we knock on it? I mean, we don't have much luck with doors.
Laura: Can I grab a stick and lift the edge of the mat up?
Liam: Do you want to do that?
Matt: Are you stopping her from doing that?
Liam: Yes, I am! Let me take a look at it, please! I've already detected it. I will attempt to disarm it with thieves' tools, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: That's fine. That is a 29.
Matt: You walk over. You look and you watch. There's a small cord that is hidden amongst the brush that runs from underneath the mat through a small ring that goes up from the house, then up a branch or vine, so it's hidden amongst them. You look straight up about 40 feet, you see a nice, solid, thick trunk that is just (creaking).
Travis: That's some Predator shit!
Matt: Right above the door.
Taliesin: I feel like there's a complicated story that goes along with all of this. I'm really excited by it.
Marisha: Is this going to be an Uncharted kind of adventure?
Taliesin: We have found the cabin of Macaulay Culkin!
Matt: So knowing this, you walk over and grab the cord. Looking to see where the leverage is, you motion to Grog to come over and hold it. You find another piece of heavy stone that is by the wall to the side. With Grog's help, you snip it, bring it over, and tie it onto the edge of this piece of the stonework, like a small pole that was placed at the base of the house. It holds the weight of this suspended trunk and it no longer triggers based on the step.
Liam: Percy, I'm sorry, I know you like a good Rube Goldberg.
Taliesin: I was really excited by this thing. It's a shame to dismantle it.
Laura: It's still there. Maybe when we leave, we can crash it down.
Liam: Does the door look hinky at all?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: You did say kinky, right?
Liam: I said hinky. 18.
Matt: 18. It does not appear to be trapped, per se. It does appear to be locked.
Liam: Yeah, well, I don't want to pick it.
Laura: I want to use a stick, and oh! Here, Scanlan, you were going to knock.
Sam: (chuckles) What is this stick?
Laura: So that you don't have to touch the door in case it's magic.
Matt: Which as a note, the door, at full height, is about at the shoulders of most of you. You recognize this. This is definitely a homestead built on the scale for probably halfling or gnome. It's still pretty big for a gnomish home, meaning it's a little more spacious headroom, you'd probably be able to stand in comfortably, except for you, Grog, you're probably a little hunched.
Liam: So it's like an ostentatious gnome door. Little more than is needed.
Sam: Like me. I'll just rap on the door with my knuckles.
Matt: Okay. There is an awkward pause.
Sam: Hello? Bidet?
Matt: Darin, if you want to go ahead onto the stage, please. (cheering)
Laura: I'm glad he didn't murder us with his bear traps.
Sam: You need this? Oh, you need this. Oh! I've been goosed.
Liam: Hey, chaotic evil necromancer gnome.
Matt: You weren't supposed to tell them.
Darin: I didn't.
Matt: So you hear amongst your business for the day, out of nowhere (knocking) on the door.
Sam: Kaitiaki!
Darin: I open it.
Matt: Okay, you hear (clicking) what sounds like six or seven different locks unlock on the door, as it slowly swings open, and before them what do they see?
Darin: A very small, elderly gnome, bald on top, with a long white beard, and a bit of a distant look in his eyes, and he looks at you and says, are you real?
Laura: I think so.
Darin: You're real? Prove it! Say that you're real to my invisible frog companion.
Sam: I will step forward and say, hello, there. (whispers) I'm real.
Darin: Yes, you're real. There is no invisible frog companion. The voices in my head would not have spoken to that. (stuttering) They know a little bit better than that, but that doesn't matter, I haven't had people here in over 35 years. (laughs) But you're here! And you're real! Go away. (laughter)
Darin: Demistrik, show them out.
Matt: You watch as two tiny red claws come around the corner as these tiny, impish wings unfurl. You watch as a tiny imp releases from the edge of the doorframe. (wings beating) "Get out!" (door slamming) and slams the door.
Darin: And show yourself out, Demistrik. I don't need you here, 19 years of you is more than enough.
Matt: You hear muffling argument through the door as the voice goes, "I'll stay where I damn please. You gave me permission to stay. If anyone is going to leave, you're going to leave!"
Darin: I think you should go to Kraghammer and become a circus performer with a little tin cup and a little hat and say, "Oh dear, I am Demistrik, the magical imp." That's where you belong, I tell you right now.
Matt: "Sounds like a lot more fun than having to deal with you on a daily basis, you son of a--"
Darin: (offended cry) Language, imp!
Matt: The door creaks open once more. "Sorry." (door closing)
Darin: The door creaks open again. I'm sorry, as well. (whispering) For him, he's awful.
Liam: I stick my foot in!
Darin: No! (laughter)
Liam: I'm really very sorry to bother you, although I'm delighted to make your acquaintance. I'm having a very hard time not just smiling like an idiot. Could we trouble you just for a few moments? We mean no harm at all. We do need to talk to you. We've come a very long way... as farts. That's got to count for something.
Laura: (sing-songy) We could give you some interesting conversation. 35 years is a very long time.
Liam: We've done a lot, we've seen a lot, we could tell you all about it.
Sam: I play an old, traditional gnome song to soften him a bit.
Matt: Make a performance check.
Laura: What is an old gnome song?
Sam: I don't know. (laughter)
Sam: 24.
Matt: It's been a long time since you've heard music, let alone one that scratches an old memory of childhood. It's nice.
Taliesin: It's more or less whatever strikes your fancy, to be fair.
All: (humming Going to the Chapel)
Matt: You see the imp in the back going, "Ugh! Stop that racket!"
Darin: You don't even appreciate music. What would an imp song sound like? You can't say one, can you? Because you don't have music where you're from.
Matt: "I can, but it'll cause your ears to bleed! It sounds like this." (screeching)
Darin: I find that very entertaining.
Matt: "You're such a liar!" The imp (poof) vanishes before you.
Darin: He's gone. Don't worry about him. He gets a little bit... testy, if you will.
Sam: May we speak? May we have a moment of your time?
Darin: Oh, well... Very well. You can come in if you like. Oh! Be careful, there's illusions and thingamabobbers.
Liam: (stammers) Sorry, that's infectious. We have a really big guy. Are you all right with him coming in? Grog, are you all right with coming in?
Travis: How the fuck do I get in that damn door?
Liam: Have you not crawled on all fours before?
Taliesin: You should try it if you haven't; it's quite delightful.
Travis: Are you lying?
Taliesin: No. For once, no, I'm not.
Travis: Can I do an insight check on Percy?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: 19.
Taliesin: I have never actually been quite so honest in my entire life. I think you'll find it very therapeutic.
Travis: I roll in on all fours.
Taliesin: How does it feel?
Travis: I'm waiting for it to kick in.
Taliesin: Crawl forward, back a bit, stretch, downward dog, stretch.
Matt: You watch as this large, gray-skinned mountain of a man crawls his way in. You could duck-walk through if you really wanted to. This is worse than Gandalf in Bag End. All fours is probably the most comfortable means of transport through the house. But you walk in and immediately, you watch as your new gnomish friend is going around and quickly disabling small things, putting small keys and tying off strings and wires you saw that were set up around portions of the room.
Taliesin: I am going to try and map this in my head, the crazy stuff I'm seeing right now.
Matt: This place is a hoarder's den. You see shelves and shelves of books and papers and scrolls and stacks of them. You see on bits of furniture and chairs more stacks of books and sacks and satchels and quills and inkwells. Some spilled and left and dried long ago. This place is very lived-in, very chaotic, and very unique.
Liam: The first thing that I do as we come in is I scan the room, or rooms, for more Macaulay Culkin shenanigans.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Maculkins. I think we can just call them Maculkins now.
Liam: That is a 21.
Matt: Okay. You do see there's one portion of the floor that he keeps avoiding, instinctually, that catches your attention. You're like, "why does he keep walking around that?"
Marisha: What's your name, friend?
Darin: Oh, well, that was taken from me a very long time ago. I only have what they call me. You know, names are an odd thing, aren't they? Sometimes a name can stick to you like blood on a knife or your fingers on a wallet that might not be your property, and then who you were is not who you are and yet... here we are.
Marisha: That oddly made way too much sense.
Sam: What do they call you?
Darin: They call me Sprigg. There's more. They call me Sprigg the Obnoxious.
Sam: Sprigg the Obnoxious?
Darin: Yes. It's not my given name; it was a name that was given to me when it was given to me.
Liam: Did you used to be obnoxious? Because I'm not picking that up.
Darin: Oh. We're rarely who we used to be.
Taliesin: Is there mercury in those pools? (laughter)
Darin: Who? Is that a friend of yours?
Taliesin: I sometimes will talk to the fourth wall. It's a thing; ignore it.
Darin: It's a domicile. There has to be four walls. If there weren't, it would be a yurt. I don't live in a yurt, dear boy.
Marisha: I sometimes live in a yurt. They're quite nice.
Darin: I have nothing against yurts. (laughs) Like a stick that you would put in a yurt so it wouldn't fall over. I would want it to fall over, therefore, I have nothing against yurts. (wheezing laughter) Demistrik!
Matt: The imp just appears across the room and just goes, "Good one. That was-- I am so sorry."
Laura: Pike? Do you think maybe a Greater Restoration is in order?
Matt: Pike goes, "Why?"
Laura: No reason.
Matt: "Could I just touch your hand for a second? Is that okay?"
Darin: (stuttering) Why?
Matt: "Just to see if we can help your day."
Darin: Do you not think that I'm real?
Matt: "Probably not."
Darin: I assure you, I'm real. I'm here. My companions are long gone. They were like you, like you, like you, and you, and you, and I'm all that is left. You are looking into a mirror of your future.
Sam: I'm going to look like you, or you're going to look like me?
Marisha: No, I know what he means. Who were your companions?
Darin: Memories. They're all memories now. I don't even remember their names. I remember some of them, but we were heroes and now I am here.
Marisha: Oh no.
Liam: Were there no other gnome folk in your party?
Darin: No, there was one like you, there was a big one, a mighty one. There was one like you, brave and kind.
Laura: That's like me! That's exactly like me.
Darin: There was one like you. Smart, yet sad. And you, as well. Yeah, and I was you.
Matt: Pike goes, "Please?" She grabs your hand and concentrates for a second, you watch as the holy symbol flares for a moment and the warmth passes through her arms into your hand. And it feels nice. It's like holding a freshly heated cup of tea. And as the spell completes and she pulls back. "That's all. Thank you."
Darin: Thank you, very kind of you. Don't ever do that again.
Matt: "Right, okay. Okay."
Sam: Your companions. Not to bring up sad times. How long ago did they go away? Perish?
Darin: 37 years.
Sam: And how, was it in a fight?
Darin: Oh, yes.
Sam: Against a powerful entity?
Darin: Oh no. Against ignorance, against bravery that should never have been. And that's why I'm here and they're not, because I ran, you see. I'm your future. You'll all be gone. You and you and you and you and you, and you'll be left.
Liam: While listening to all that, Vax slid his hand into Keyleth's and quietly listened to the whole thing.
Darin: Oh, well. Perhaps we should talk of other things. Should we?
Sam: Yes. Yes, we want this to be a positive visit for you, so is there anything we can tell you from the world outside that you might be curious about?
Darin: The world outside? Who needs the world outside? I have everything here, and what I need, dear boy, I have taken from Kraghammer. All these books over there, you see, those are mine. They should have been mine to begin with, and I took them, and now they are mine. (wheezing laughter)
Taliesin: I'm going to peruse some of these titles, quietly.
Sam: The books, you mean?
Darin: Yes. You'd like to look at the books, would you?
Taliesin: I find it's the easiest way to learn quite a bit about a person.
Darin: Oh, you're very welcome to look at anything you like. What will you give me, dear boy? I require something. And yet, what do I need, living here? Not much. Intelligence, no. Secrets, no. Love, no. Sadness, bravery, power. What do you have that you would give me?
Travis: I reach in the Bag of Holding. I take out Percy's glasses. Would you care for a pair of these testicl-- spectacles?
Darin: I seek power, dear boy, not silliness. If I wanted silliness, I would talk to a Sun Tree. No one ever should talk to a Sun Tree, they should only listen to a Sun Tree. And so I shall say again, if you would like to peruse my book and perhaps find what you are looking for, what will you give me that would bring power and redemption into my life?
Sam: What do you have, Grog?
Laura: (whispering) Give him some ale.
Travis: But that's not fucking power.
Laura: You don't know. Bet it's been a while since he's had some of that.
Darin: It seems you have powerful items.
Travis: I do. I have these Bracers of Defense.
Darin: Ah, but that is strength. I require power.
Travis: (softly) Shit. Fuck.
Taliesin: Well, I reach into my bag and start cleaning a small green shard of residuum, polishing it.
Darin: Demistrik! If you excuse me for a just-- while you look, I'll just talk to my imp. You'll pardon us. (whispering) A word, Demistrik?
Matt: "Ugh. Just one moment. What?"
Darin: The big one worries me. I think we should have a code in case we have to jump him.
Matt: "What code would you wish?"
Darin: Goliath grab! But we need to remember that. We need to remember that.
Matt: "Goliath grab. Good luck!"
Darin: We need some sort of mnemonic device to remember goliath grab. G, goodness gracious, grab that goliath. O?
Matt: "O? Huh. I'll tell you what, I've got your back."
Darin: I don't feel that at all. You're right in front of me. How could you have my back? (wheezing chuckle) I got you. (laughing) Go away. So what do you have for me? You've had ample time to look in your Bag of Holding to produce something very--
Travis: Powerful. Well, I do have one thing that seems to be pretty powerful.
Marisha: Oh no, Grog.
Travis: I pull out of the Bag of Holding a small leather case. I open the flap. I don't know if you have any interest in this, but my experience with these items has been very extreme. Would you care to take a card?
Darin: Would you care to give them to me?
Sam: All or just one?
Travis: No, you can pick a card.
Matt: Make an arcana check. Roll a d20 and add your arcana skill modifier to it.
Taliesin: You are a madman.
Darin: 15.
Matt: 15. You don't recognize what he's holding in his hands, but you immediately see the leather casing around it, and your essence being able to read certain elements of magic-- It does appear to be a powerful enchantment, whatever he has procured from the bag.
Darin: Indeed. Perhaps one card for one book?
Travis: Yeah, sure. I mean, Percy, do you have a book out of all of these that you want to read?
Darin: What are you looking for? What do you seek? What knowledge? I've got it all here.
Sam: We seek a key.
Laura: To find a very ancient goddess--
Darin: Oh, don't say Ioun.
Taliesin: We're not going to say Ioun.
Darin: You just did!
Liam: Is there another name that you would like us to use? Like a nickname instead of Ioun?
Darin: The Broken Goddess. I know more than Ioun, please! Ioun. Gods, what do they know? We know more than they, for we exist! We live! We adventure! They merely observe. Am I right?
Sam: You have a point. They don't do much for us in the day-to-day.
Taliesin: Are you saying you know more than Ioun?
Darin: Of course I know more than Ioun.
Taliesin: Can you prove that you know more than Ioun?
Darin: Yes.
Taliesin: So if I ask you a question that is almost impossible to answer, you could answer it before Ioun could answer it?
Darin: Could Ioun create a rock so heavy that even she couldn't lift it?
Taliesin: Oh, please. I'm far too clever to ask such a simple question. That's easy. I would have to ask something that was very difficult to answer.
Darin: I will give you your answer if you give me a card.
Liam: You know, I was just saying what a good idea I thought it was, but I thought you were talking about the entire deck, Grog. I think the entire deck is a fairer thing than to have him pull a card, because that seems unpredictable to me.
Travis: Yeah, that sounds perfect to me.
Liam: We're all in a small, enclosed space together, Grog, and I like this fellow.
Laura: Sprigg, it is quite powerful, yes, but also maybe slightly dangerous.
Taliesin: A bit dangerous, to be fair.
Darin: I'm here alone. Well, there's... oh, yes. Go peddle your papers somewhere where they'd like papers peddled!
Laura: You're not alone at the moment.
Darin: That's true!
Laura: This is very true. And I'd rather not put my life in the hands of you, not knowing you very well.
Darin: Some did. I'm here.
Laura: Yes.
Darin: They are not.
Laura: So something bad could happen, and you'd run away, and we'd be stuck here?
Darin: No. 37 years. I ran away. I've been here deciding how to live again, how not to run away. That's what all this is about, isn't it? You can't just hide from the world. I've done it! Done it for a long, long time. Maybe you being here means that I should hide no longer. Or maybe I just have an invisible frog friend. Maybe I have nothing here, and nothing here.
Taliesin: Whoever has devised these contraptions and created this safety for you is a genius. I'm not saying you're necessarily--
Darin: It was both of us.
Taliesin: I somehow don't think so.
Darin: What?
Matt: "It was all me."
Taliesin: I've had my own demons to contend with in my life, to make me doubt my own intelligence. I get the sense that your compatriot-- I hate to call it friend, here--
Darin: I hate to call it friend, and yet I do. Isn't that right, friend?
Matt: "Unfortunately."
Taliesin: What are you doing here?
Darin: You can tell them.
Matt: "No!"
Darin: Just tell him.
Matt: "No! Why, because he asked me?"
Darin: Yes! Be polite. They're guests in our home.
Matt: "Oh, it's not our home."
Darin: 19 years you've been here, ever since your master died trying to enter and got tricked into one of my traps, and now you're here-- does that answer your question?-- now, why don't you tell him what I just said?
Matt: "My master died trying to get in here on one of the traps, and now I call this my home."
Darin: Beautifully said. Bravo. You should be a little performer in Kraghammer. You know what the reviews would be? Not very good! Shameful behavior. Abysmal behavior from the Abyss itself!
Taliesin: We don't have much. Many of the things that we carry are very dangerous. Obviously, you have a great deal of genius here. I'm going to show him the elemental shard. I don't know if this would interest you, but I consider it to be of great value.
Matt: So you're showing him the residuum piece?
Taliesin: The last piece of residuum I have.
Matt: All right. So this is a sliver of what looks like green glass. It's finely polished, about that thick, that long. You've read about this. You've read that condensed residuum is very susceptible to enchantment and/or the focusing of short-term magic spells. It's expensive, it's lauded, it's hard to find.
Darin: I will use that Ring of Telekinesis to lift it up and take a better look at it.
Matt: You watch as it darts out of your hand and wisps up, maybe two feet ahead of him, and slowly rotates above him as he inspects it.
Taliesin: Impressive, but not as impressive as the giant log.
Darin: Oh, yes. But is there power in this, dear boy? Or are there only secrets? For you are secrets. He is power.
Taliesin: I may be secrets, and that is of me, but I believe there is power in its secret. People died for that. Many people.
Darin: People die every day. Except me. That's my punishment, child. I live on. I live on with my shame and my intelligence and you.
Laura: Because of Ioun?
Marisha: What's your relationship to her?
Darin: What is anyone's relationship to a god?
Marisha: Good question.
Laura: Some of us are champions. Some of them don't like them. Some of them worship them but don't really get respect. What's yours?
Darin: All of that and more.
Laura: So you're a champion? Are you a champion of Ioun?
Marisha: You're a champion of Ioun. Of course he's a champion of Ioun.
Darin: I wouldn't say that.
Taliesin: But we might, wouldn't we?
Darin: Champion of Ioun?
Matt: (demonic cackling)
Darin: Are you going to start calling me Ioun's Champion?
Matt: "Only if it bothers you, Ioun's Champion!"
Darin: I like it. Drat, eh? Drat. You tell them what you know of Ioun.
Matt: "She's a heinous bitch who got what's coming to her 800 years ago."
Marisha: What?
Darin: It's a bit common, but that is his belief. What is yours? What is your thought about Ioun?
Sam: We know that she possesses knowledge that could help us in our quest to save the world, and therefore, no matter what her personality is, she is valuable to us.
Darin: And yet, is there value in saving the world? Or should you just let it all go away?
Laura: No, no, I think we should save it.
Sam: Yeah, we're pro-world here.
Darin: Are you? That is interesting.
Liam: Sprigg, you're seeking power.
Darin: I seek redemption. There is great power in redemption.
Liam: We offer you redemption. Collaborating with us grants you the power to fell a would-be god.
Darin: Excuse me. For one second. Can I speak to you for just a second?
Matt: (flapping wings) "What?"
Darin: He's tricky. I think we should get a mnemonic device on what we need to do if he becomes too tricky. We should say, elf boy grab! E! For egads! There's an elf, we should grab him. L! Let's grab that elf boy.
Matt: "Right, all right." You guys can hear all of this.
Darin: F. Forsooth, I shall grab this elf boy!
Liam: I'm not an elf. Not an elf.
Marisha: Why do people like calling you elf boy and elf girl?
Liam: We have vaguely pointed ears. Not even fully pointed ears. My mother was not an elf.
Darin: Just a second. He's not an elf!
Matt: "We'll stick with the device. I've got your back."
Darin: I still don't feel it.
Matt: "You will."
Darin: All right. Hello!
Sam: Hi. Hi, mirror man. Listen.
Darin: All right.
Sam: Let's cut to the chase here. We need information from you.
Darin: Indeed.
Sam: You need something from us. Grog, give him a card.
Marisha: Wait.
Sam: We're dancing around this! We need this man!
Laura: He took the stone! Are you taking the stone?
Sam: Are you going to take the stone as a source of power? He said it's too mysterious.
Liam: I thought we were talking about redemption.
Darin: If you'll allow me. You've been very quiet.
Marisha: Yes, I'm a little freaked out right now. You're my worst fear incarnate. Sorry, that seemed very rude. My worst nightmare incarnate.
Darin: That didn't make it any better, dear child!
Matt: (cackling)
Darin: (shushing) Go ahead. Why am I your worst fear in a carnation?
Marisha: I've seen you in my dreams.
Darin: Hear that?
Matt: "Go get her, tiger."
Laura: Trinket starts chasing the imp around the room.
Matt: "No!" Up into the corner, (hissing). Turns invisible.
Darin: Oh, I guess you found that unbearable!
Sam: That was a good pun.
Matt: You hear the tiniest little demonic fart by your ear.
Liam: I'm also gently steering Trinket away from the floorboard in the middle of the room as he walked by.
Marisha: Somehow everything you have said since the minute we've walked into this building has made 100% sense, and I think that's what scares me the most, is I understand everything you've said.
Darin: It should scare you the most. I was one of you. I did what you did. 37 years ago, I did it. And we fought, and we fought, and they were right here. They were right here!
Sam: Who is they?
Darin: My companions.
Sam: And who were you fighting against? You, we?
Travis: Vecna.
Darin: No.
Sam: Gods?
Darin: It was silly. It was hobgoblins. It should never have happened. It was a simple fight, and they died, and I ran, and I can't even remember their names.
Liam: Sprigg.
Darin: Yes?
Liam: Would you like to be needed again? Maybe it's time to stop running.
Darin: What would I do?
Marisha: We can grant you power in items, but I don't want to speak for all of us, but I think all of us can speak a little bit to the fact that items don't grant you as much inner power as you expect them to.
Laura: Unless they're boots. And then they're amazing.
Marisha: Unless they're very highly argued and debated-upon boots, in which case I still think the argument--
Darin: Are we about to have a debate about boots? I'm against them! Your turn.
Laura: I am for them, usually.
Darin: Continue, Councilor, but watch yourself.
Laura: Have you any idea where the key to Ioun is?
Darin: In the boots? We're talking about boots, are we?
Laura: Yes. Boots that hold a key to Ioun's location. Specifically.
Darin: I think the key might be here, but I don't really know.
Liam: Sprigg, the world is on the brink right now. It's worse than hobgoblins. We've come here in great need, and the world is in great need, and the power that I offer you is making a difference.
Darin: Then make me believe in Ioun. We'll make a difference together.
Liam: Make you believe?
Marisha: Of course he believes. Believing is not the question.
Darin: Books everywhere, you see. That's something you can hold. That's something you can learn.
Marisha: That's something that's tangible. Ioun is distant.
Laura: But she could be tangible if you'd help us find her.
Marisha: What if we have found her? What if Sprigg is right? What if all of the information that Ioun knows is here in Sprigg?
Taliesin: I really want to look at these. I want to look at these books really quickly. I'm having a moment. I just want to start looking at these titles. What are these books?
Matt: You go over and start walking towards the edge of the nearest bookcase, and all of you at once-- everyone but Sprigg, actually-- suddenly hear a voice come through, filling your mind, filling your consciousness, filling your ears. Sourceless, delivered to your consciousness directly. "Thank you for showing me where he is." And that's where we're going to take a break.
Liam: Fuck!
Marisha: How? We don't have the eye! What a cock!
Taliesin: Oh my god, he's been in the troll dick all along.
Marisha: It's always been the troll dick.
Matt: All right, we'll be in just a minute. We'll be back here in a few minutes, guys. For the Twitch giveaway, we have this awesome Peruvian walnut dice tray, leather interior. It's very nice. It's the same type that I have, actually, back here, which is nice. Giving it away for somebody in the Twitch chat, so run on over, and the code for the evening is Sprigg. S-P-R-I...
Darin: G-G.
Matt: G-G. Double G.
Darin: S-P-R-I-G-G spells Sprigg, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to win that valuable prize.
Matt: So pay attention in the chat. When it's time to, go ahead and enter Sprigg into the chat, and one lucky winner will be announced when we get back here. See you guys in a few minutes! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so first and foremost, we have our winner for the dice tray from Wyrmwood. That is our friend k0sn1ght, spelled in the way that you spell your XBox Live name: k0sn1ght. Congratulations, you are the winner. Go ahead and contact Danoba and get your information and we'll get that shipped out to you. Bringing us back in.
Taliesin: That was fast.
Matt: Last we left off, you all, almost all of you, heard a singular familiar voice. The low, gravelly undead voice of The Whispered One fills your minds, saying, "Thank you for showing me where he is." In that moment where you all pause in place, you hear a series of simultaneous sounds (arrows firing) as a number of heavy crossbow bolts from nearby windows all fire simultaneously at Sprigg.
Marisha: Do I have time for a reaction?
Matt: No, you do not. This is a surprise round.
Liam: This is the sound of bolts, no.
Travis: It's all right, he can't die. It's cool. We're all right.
Matt: So that first one is a 24. What's your armor class?
Darin: My armor class is 19.
Matt: Okay! So you take 23 points of piercing damage.
Darin: Okay. Oh, there we go.
Matt: That's 17. That misses you. It strikes your shoulder and glances off. One bolt sinks into your chest and you look down and you see it's this big, long heavy metal bolt and it's jutting out from the side of where your shoulder and pec is. Another one rushes by and glances off your other shoulder. The third one--
Darin: Well, this is different.
Matt: That hits. That's a 25. That's 23 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Matt: That one actually misses; a six and a one. It slams into one of the nearby books right behind you, barely moving past your cheek. Fifth one, that is a 19 exactly, so you take 24 points of damage.
Laura: How many fucking bolts are there?
Marisha: 24?
Matt: They're all sneak attack. And that is 20.
Darin: Another one?
Matt: Another one.
Darin: Okay.
Matt: That one's going to be 26 points of piercing damage.
Darin: I'm gone.
Matt: You guys watch as all these bolts (arrows firing and impacting) into Sprigg's body and Sprigg falls back, unconscious on the side of the room. I'm going to bring out a map now.
Darin: Fly, you fools!
Marisha: (yelling) No, Sprigg!
Sam: Darin, it was really great having you on. Thanks so much.
Laura: Whoa, cool!
Sam: Whoa, this is a cute house!
Laura: Oh, I can't see inside of it.
Matt: Moving the top floor off.
Liam: There's crates of apples!
Sam: There's a sack of something in the corner! Oh my god, how are we all going to fit in there?
Matt: Sprigg is currently unconscious on the ground there. Percival was there talking. Trinket is off to the side.
Laura: Trinket! Where's the imp?
Matt: The imp is not currently visible. Pike would be over on the side here. Keyleth, Vax, where would you guys see yourselves right now? Actually, tell me where you would be. I think that's what I'm trying to ask.
Liam: I would be right next to Keyleth because I was holding her hand.
Matt: As I chuck you onto the ground.
Liam: It's all right. It's fine.
Matt: Yeah, comes back in a day later. All right, cool. So you're there holding that. Scanlan, where would you be?
Sam: Near Sprigg-ish.
Matt: All right, so I'll put you right there next to the scroll in the ground.
Liam: And Matt? Could you touch on the map where the bad man touched you? No, where the bad floorboard is?
Matt: Yes, actually, I can do that.
Liam: None of you know this.
Matt: None of you know this, except for you, which is actually why I'm not going to show you. You know how to avoid it, but nobody else knows where it is.
Laura: Where is the front door?
Matt: The front door is right there.
Liam: There, over by Grog on your right.
Sam: These trees need to move.
Laura: I know, these trees are a pain in our butts. Oh no.
Sam: There's cloaked men everywhere
Matt: You watch as one that was up in the stairs vanishes up top.
Travis: Oh, he actually made it upstairs?
Matt: He fired, and then ducked up there. I need everyone to roll initiative.
Sam: Initiative?
Matt: Yes. Including you, even though you're on the ground.
Marisha: Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil. It's fine. Gil did all right.
Sam: I don't trust Gil. I never roll on his dice.
Liam: Rarely. I have, but I got my Matt Colville meteorite.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: 20.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Oh wow, so we have Percy, we have Grog, and Vax. Okay, 20 to 15?
Sam: 19.
Laura: Should somebody roll for Pike?
Matt: Yes, actually. Okay, yeah.
Darin: Also a 19.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You've got a very low initiative bonus.
Matt: All righty, anybody else?
Laura: 13.
Marisha: 12. I don't know why I did deuces. 12.
Taliesin: Peace out.
Sam: NKOTB.
Marisha: 12 initiative, Wu Tang out.
Taliesin: That's our next shirt.
Sam: Quidd, everyone. Quidd.
Laura: Quidd.
Liam: Quid pro quo.
Matt: All right, so top of the combat round. The surprise round is done, you watch Sprigg fall to the ground, bolts sticking out of the side of the neck, the shoulder, and the body. Unconscious, now beginning to pool blood underneath where he's bleeding out, and you glance around and you see a series of shaded figures in the windows that all dart out of the way.
Marisha: Cowards.
Laura: Dicks.
Sam: Oh, they left. The fight's over, everyone.
Matt: Percy, you're up first.
Taliesin: Wow, this is a lot that happened. I'm going to click my boots, and I'm going to run up the wall and run upstairs.
Matt: Which, for the purposes of this, I will place the upstairs over here. So as you dart up, Percival, you run up the stairway there where the one guy you saw was standing.
Taliesin: Is he right there?
Matt: Yeah, he ducked out of the way, and there's also one figure that you recognize from the Shadowfell earlier. You see one of the ghastly creatures that was darting through the ruins leaping from from rooftop to rooftop. Its skin is grayish and long, its limbs lanky, its fingers curled into claws, and this long tongue dangling from his jaws, it's getting ready to run down the stairs as you charge him, and it goes (growls).
Taliesin: Manners! Action Surge!
Marisha: Yay, Manners!
Matt: Okay then.
Marisha: We're bad at manners, until now!
Matt: All righty, so what's the saving throw on that one?
Taliesin: It's a DC 20 strength. Oh, I'm sorry, no. Never mind. It's an attack roll.
Matt: Okay, so you have to roll first to see if you hit it.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18? Yeah, that definitely hits. It hits, and you watch as you pull the sphere out and chuck it in the direction of the creature. Pulls its claws back, slams into its chest, and then unravels. It falls to the ground, prone, unable to move, right there in the middle of the floor.
Taliesin: Just making sure that I can do this.
Matt: Was that your action, there, doing that?
Taliesin: That was my action surge. I can only do one round. Just seeing if I have anything at a bonus that I can do.
Matt: You spent your action--?
Taliesin: My action, I activated my boots. My action surge activating that. Do I have anything I can do with a bonus action?
Matt: Not really.
Taliesin: I'm going to turn to the other guy and pull the ripcord on the glove angrily. (revving)
Matt: You load up Diplomacy. Good. That's your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Me? Oh? Can I go into a rage?
Matt: Yes, you may.
Travis: And he fell where?
Matt: He fell right there, on the ground, currently bleeding out.
Travis: Can I run over to Sprigg and shove a-- should I shove a health potion in his throat?
Laura: Well, we've got healers.
Travis: Right. I'll run upstairs to see where Percy went.
Matt: You rage-run just past Percival and you see there's one creature bound on the ground and there's another guy who's there with his crossbow, he's trying to reload, who sees Percival and is getting ready to pull it up as you leap in front.
Taliesin: Smash him!
Travis: Do you mind?
Taliesin: Please!
Travis: Yeah. (rage noises)
Matt: Go for it. Roll for a double attack.
Travis: Reckless! Not Great Weapon Master. Two-handed with the Dwarven Thrower. That's a lot. 30, minus-- oh, there is no minus. 32.
Matt: 32 hits. Second attack?
Travis: 31.
Matt: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.
Travis: So they're not giants. So I just roll a d10. That's a ten. Rage damage. 25.
Matt: 25 damage on the first hit?
Travis: On the first one. Second one.
Laura: 24.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Nice. With your hammer, two hands, whack right across the side of its head. You see the jaw unhinge from the side. As he pulls back, it's hanging loosely there, and the second hit you clock right in the side of the temple, and it nearly goes unconscious, and picks itself up again, gets its crossbow ready. It's still holding. It's not down yet, but it's hurt badly. You can see now, up close, you can see these figures, they're dressed in very, very tight black leathers, cloaks enshrouding their body, the hood is still up, but you've knocked it back. There you see a human male in his late 40s, early 50s, the head shaved completely bald, a tattoo of black tendrils around the left eye, and the left eye is missing from the socket.
Travis: Black tendrils? Okay, cool. That's my turn.
Matt: That's your turn. All right. Grog's done. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, let's talk this out. Click the Boots of Haste. I think, with 120 feet of movement, I can blur up the stairs to where Percy is in probably 50 or 60 feet. And then finish that movement and go past the guy, out the window, with all of my movement in 120 feet or less. Okay, so I'm doing that.
Matt: There's also a window here, a window here, and a window here. Just so you guys know, and a window here, if you wanted.
Liam: Definitely understand. Blur up the stairs, shoot past Percy, shoot past that guy, out the window.
Matt: You're on the balcony now, looking right about here.
Liam: Do I already see those guys?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 19 plus 14 is a hell of a lot.
Matt: 19 plus 14? Yeah, you do see them. And you glance down, you can see they're hiding amongst bushes, and they're specifically stealthed. But you're keen of eye enough to see where they're placed.
Liam: I stealth, hide. Bonus action to hide. I'm going to use Luck. That's better. 27.
Matt: 27. Okay. You're not sure if they see you or not.
Liam: All right, then from this spot, if they're in range, I'm going to throw Whisper at one of them.
Matt: Right now, you are currently up here. So you glance off and you can barely see one that's over the edge of the roof right there. That's the only one you can see.
Liam: But I can see them and I can ignore three-quarters cover because of Sharpshooter.
Matt: So you barely see the edge of one there. Sharpshooter. I'd say yeah, you can. You can hit both, if you want.
Liam: So the one that I can see, hidden, I will try to throw Whisper. I'm going to hopefully sneak attack him and bamf there. That is a 28.
Matt: 28. He does not see you. So you have advantage on that if you want to roll again.
Liam: Right. Natural 20.
Taliesin: Turn him into paste.
Liam: Okay. (counting)
Sam: Did Pike roll?
Matt: Pike did.
Laura: What did she get?
Matt: 11. Typical Pike.
Marisha: She's after me.
Laura: Well, no, but Sprigg is right after Scanlan. He's before we are. So I'd rather get him up before.
Liam: So that one is 60 on that guy.
Matt: 60 points of damage?
Liam: Yes, and I bamf there.
Matt: As you chuck the dagger, like right towards where the center of the shoulderblades connect in the back he (groans) and you watch as the crossbow that he had drops to the ground and he crumples over on top of it, but he slowly starts getting to his feet out of the bushes. He looks really hurt, but he's still standing. And you appear right next to him there.
Liam: So I did movement, I hid for my bonus, I have action-action as a paladin. And action.
Matt: You have attack-attack as a paladin.
Liam: Attack-attack as a paladin. And then my bonus action. That was the first of attack-attack, so now I'll just do a regular attack, which is a 20--
Laura: (sarcastically) I'm so glad he got those boots back, I'm just so glad.
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Liam: That is a ten and I'm going to pump him full of poison. He has to make a DC check on 15.
Matt: That is a seven. No. Four plus three.
Liam: So he also gets, that was ten plus 14 total. 20 total, between the dagger and the poison.
Matt: So the second dagger, you shiv him in the side and he (groans) goes to spin with the heavy crossbow and try and pull away, and as soon as the poison through him he goes, (gurgles) and you can see blood vomit down the front of his chest, his eyes roll back and he twinges and falls to the ground.
Liam: And there's another guy there who can see me, right?
Matt: Yeah, and he's hidden, but he's like (scared, heavy breathing).
Liam: Whisper.
Matt: Okay, he's trying to see that you're not being seen.
Liam: That is 31. Yeah, okay. So that is two plus eight is ten, plus psychic damage. 18. I'm going to bamf there with Whisper.
Matt: Okay. All righty. You hit him and you stand there. You're right in front of him now. All righty. That ends your go. As you appear over on the other side, you realize that over in the clearing there, there is another one of the robed figures, this one clutching a long, black, smooth staff that crooks over in the front that looks like a hand holding an eye.
Marisha: What? Where? Who? There were more of them!
Liam: But you guys don't know that yet.
Matt: You guys don't know that yet, just him. Ending your turn, Vax. That guy on the ground is going to try and break free. That is a 17. DC 20?
Taliesin: DC 20.
Matt: It struggles on the ground and can't seem to break free of the current magic manacles that hold it in place.
Taliesin: Yeah, he's stuck. I love that we have floors!
Matt: Another one of these darts through the window, leaps across the way, right in front of Sprigg, and you being right there, Scanlan, goes, (angry hissing) and lashes out at you.
Marisha: He's going for Sprigg!
Taliesin: He's going for Scanlan.
Marisha: But because Scanlan's over Sprigg!
Taliesin: Oh, that's fair.
Matt: Makes two claw strikes at you. First one is 16 to hit.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: All right. You suffer eight points of slashing damage, and I need you make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Oh boy. Not great. 16.
Matt: 16, okay.
Sam: Is it magical?
Matt: No, it is not magical, but you feel this pulse of some sort of necrotic disease hit your system, and you just manage to shrug it off. (relieved cheering)
Matt: The other claw comes towards you. That's a natural 20.
Sam: Natural 20 to hit, sure.
Matt: That is 30 points of slashing damage on the second hit. Make another saving throw, please.
Sam: That's 17.
Matt: 17. The second strike hits you and you feel as the side of your torso gets torn out of the side, the blood splatters onto Sprigg, who's already bloodied and now there's gnome blood on gnome blood. As you reach for your side, however, it does not take effect; you manage to shrug off.
Travis: Those are constitution saving throws?
Matt: Yeah. That ends the shadow ghast's turn. Sprigg, I need you to make a death saving throw, please. Roll a d20.
Liam: Come on, Sprigg!
Marisha: Come on, Sprigg!
Darin: 14.
Matt: Okay, so you're okay for now. You're stabilizing. You're not bleeding out, yet. Mark a success on your death saving throws there. Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: I am going to, bonus action-- down here, success, one.
Matt: Actually, before he even does that, what are you doing on your turn?
Sam: I'm going to heal him first.
Matt: That roll wouldn't matter because he may heal you before you come up. Don't worry about it.
Sam: I'll bonus action Healing Word him, 2nd-level. I will sing to him. I'll do a little line dance right in front of him and I'll say: (singing) I'll heal your heart, your achy breaky heart. I just don't think you'll understand. That if I heal your heart, your achy breaky heart, you got to wake up and kill a man!
All: Ooh!
Darin: (singing) If only you had used Mage Hand!
Sam: Nice!
Matt: So how much does he heal?
Sam: Seven plus six. 13.
Matt: You heal 13 hit points. That roll doesn't matter. You hear this echoing song in the back of your head. The second song today you've heard from your childhood. You come to consciousness. You wake up and look around you and you can see him singing to you as this giant horrible necrotic creature is looming right in front of you. You have metal bolts sticking out of your chest and an old sensation you haven't felt in a long time courses through your body, which is the need to survive.
Sam: It's my turn still.
Matt: It's both of your turns at the same time.
Sam: I will hold my turn.
Matt: What are you going to do?
Sam: Dimension Door, but I'm holding until either Pike or Keyleth heals him more. And I will also say to him, old man, do you have some fight left in you?
Darin: I hope so.
Sam: Hold that thought for one second.
Darin: Holding.
Matt: So what are you doing?
Darin: There's a bookcase, is there not?
Matt: There's bookcases here, bookcase there. There's books strewn and clustered in these corners.
Darin: I'd like to, if I could, use the Ring of Telekinesis to pull a bookcase down upon an attacker.
Matt: Okay. Currently there's a bunch of books up here on a shelf, you can pull them down on him if you'd like.
Darin: I would like to do that.
Matt: So from the ground, you yank a bunch of heavy tomes off of this large shelf that goes flying towards this creature. I'm going to make this a dexterity saving throw for it.
Marisha: The pen is mightier than the bookcase security!
Matt: What's the DC on the telekinesis ring?
Darin: Where was it? Ring of Telekinesis.
Matt: I'll pull it up here real fast. Looking up magical items really fast. I have it here. Oh, it's for the spell Telekinesis? That's right. What's your spell DC?
Darin: 17.
Matt: 17. No, that's a failure. So for this, go ahead and roll 3d6.
Sam: He failed, or the guy failed?
Matt: The guy failed. He didn't dodge out of the way. He's like, (confused snarling, book impacts) and gets pummeled from behind by a bunch of tomes, books, and random glass baubles that were on the shelf that shatter against the back of its head.
Darin: We have a six, we have a five, and we have a two. 13.
Matt: Then add your intelligence modifier.
Darin: My intelligence modifier is a four.
Matt: 17, nice! 17 points of damage to that one. As you slam it in the back of the head (impacts) and it doubles over and (snarling), its long tongue slashing around. You're still on the ground, and it's over you. Is there anything else you want to do on your turn?
Darin: Demistrik?!
Matt: You hear nothing.
Taliesin: Not cool.
Darin: Can I cast something?
Matt: That is an action to do that, so if you have a bonus action spell, you could do that.
Darin: I believe I do. Tasha's Hideous Laughter?
Matt: I believe that's an action to cast, unfortunately.
Darin: I don't think we have any bonus actions. Oh, are there any healing potions that I can use my Telekinesis to get a healing potion to me?
Matt: You can do that next round. The attack was your one action. You can stand on your feet, if you'd like to.
Darin: No, I'm gonna stay right here.
Matt: Got it. That ends your turn. Now, these guys go again.
Laura: That's good, they're at disadvantage, now, to hit you. They are! Because you're prone.
Matt: This guy's going to move in. This guy is still standing and is going to drop the crossbow and pull out his shortsword. Is going to go ahead and attack you, Grog, first. That is 13?
Travis: Misses.
Matt: And a 27.
Travis: That does hit.
Matt: You take five plus four, that's nine points of slashing damage, reduced to five, yeah. Round down, so it's four. Struck twice, missed both. Both of these guys are going to fire at-- one of them's going to fire at Sprigg on this end because it's their goal, here. With disadvantage, that is a 16? What's your AC again?
Darin: My AC is 19.
Matt: 19, yeah. It darts over you. It misses, it hits the side of the wall. The other guy's going to strike again with disadvantage. That's a 14. And you see the other guy pulling back with a crossbow and fire. You roll out of the way and it (arrow vibrating) into the wooden flooring right next to you.
Darin: Are there any traps that they hit?
Matt: No. That one is going to attack you, Vax, because you're right there in front of it. That's going to be a 13. Does not hit. Second strike, another 13. Both of its shortsword attacks, you duck out of the way and dodge, moving around very quickly. All righty. Those two right there, one of them is going to, because it saw that you got up, Scanlan, they're going to fire two bolts directly at you. That is a 16 to hit?
Sam: That hits.
Matt: Okay, and the second one is a 24.
Sam: Everything hits.
Matt: You are currently in base-to-base with one of their companions, so they both get sneak attack on you. 19 points of piercing damage from the first hit. 24 points of piercing damage from the second hit. And then they both duck around the side here.
Sam: What was the second one? 24.
Matt: They both, we'll say, they vanish from sight. You're not quite sure where they are right now. Those two also duck out of sight, not quite sure where they are, either. That ends their go. Now, the guy in the back right there, who noticed Vax show up, is going to, after you slaughter one of the guys, and stab the other one, is going to angrily go ahead and use Blight on you. Can you go ahead an make a constitution saving throw, please?
Liam: Natural 20. You fucking dick, necro guy!
Matt: All righty. That does half the damage.
Liam: It's still a lot.
Taliesin: I feel like a natural 20 should auto-fail this.
Laura: I know, right?
Matt: 21 points of necrotic damage to you.
Liam: All righty.
Matt: And is going to-- four, five, six. All righty. That ends his turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to run over to the window that those guys disappeared from.
Matt: Over this way or this way?
Laura: Right there, yeah. Can I see that motherfucker? Did I see him run past the window?
Matt: You know what? Yes, because he was not stealthing. You watch as he darts by, and you would have a shot, yeah.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to shoot at him. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him!
Matt: All righty, look at that!
Laura: Trinket doesn't have enough movement to get over by him, does he?
Matt: No, but Trinket can attack whatever's in your area, too.
Laura: I'm going to attack him with my Bramble Shot. With the Blazing Bowstring. Ooh, yeah. That's a 31.
Matt: 31? That hits!
Laura: Yes! Okay! Do I get sneak attack on him? I don't, do I?
Matt: No.
Laura: Damn! At least I got Hunter's Mark. Okay.
Liam: Hey Matt, I realized. I never shot out the wings, so I shouldn't have had as much movement as I did, so I think we should take the damage back from my last attack.
Matt: (counting). 50 to get up to the top there, so at your double speed, you'd be at 60, threw the dagger and threw the dagger. You're fine. It still works out.
Laura: Okay, 28 plus my 4d8 piercing damage. That's balls.
Matt: You're on deck, Keyleth, just so you know.
Laura: Seven, nine, plus nine is 37. 37 points of damage.
Matt: The first arrow hits him in the stomach, doubles forward and pulls back. Now, glancing over, saw you rush up and couldn't get out in time and now is going to try and back up as you're taking the second shot.
Laura: Does he roll a DC of over 17? A strength save?
Matt: Rolls a natural 17. Literally. Strength save? Minus one strength modifier. (cheering)
Matt: Oh, silly necromancer. You and your strength of nine. All right, so he is currently entangled in the brambles as the vines wrap around and pull him in, almost near the tree. You see the staff is pulled close to his chest.
Laura: Nice. Then I am going to shoot him. Oh, wait! I didn't add my Blazing Bowstring damage. Eight more for the Blazing Bowstring. And then I'm going to shoot him again. I'm just asking: do you get sneak attack damage if they're restrained?
Matt: You do, yeah. You can do that. You have advantage on the attack, remember, because he's restrained.
Laura: That's okay. Eight plus 14 is what? 32?
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Laura: Oh gosh! Okay! Ten, 11, 12, 13, plus sneak attack. 13. What's that? Ten. So 23. And then Hunter's Mark. Plus one. 24.
Matt: 24. Nice. The second arrow hits right in the throat, and you can see it doesn't hit anything vital, but you can see blood's starting to pour out. It's one of those things that if he were to pull it out, it would probably be very bad. But he's leaving it in right now. He's looking pretty rough.
Travis: The necromancer is?
Matt: Yeah. All righty. That ends your turn? Keyleth, your turn.
Laura: I'm going to step away from the window.
Matt: Okay. Step away from the window.
Laura: No, against the wall.
Matt: Against the wall there? You push the table back a bit; book almost falls off the top. What's Trinket doing?
Laura: Trinket is going to run over to Sprigg and Scanlan.
Matt: Up to Scanlan, or the guy who's there?
Laura: Just to the guy.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just try to growl at him and scare him because he can't attack him.
Taliesin: He's technically now engaged with the bear, so if he walks away, the bear gets an attack of opportunity.
Matt: That's true. That ends your turn. Trinket goes (roars) right in front of the creature. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Okay. In my weird, emotional panic, Keyleth is going to turn and look around and she sees Vex firing a bow and Sprigg down on the floor, and she's upset, and she's just going to scream at the top of her lungs and do a Fire Storm around the building. Just (screams) and then I'm going to go (boof) where I think people might be in my rage.
Matt: Okay! So around the building where?
Marisha: Around the building. Sorry, Vax. I don't really know you're there, but around here and around here, and I'm sure I see Vex shooting at things, right? I'm going to try and go around.
Matt: So you have right here.
Marisha: Here, around, and that way.
Matt: All right. Okay, because you didn't see Vax outside.
Marisha: No. He's getting hit.
Matt: You saw Vax run upstairs.
Marisha: I just know there were people shooting through this window and through this window, so I'm doing a perimeter around.
Matt: How many squares is it? Ten, right?
Marisha: Ten ten-by-tens.
Matt: These two here get caught in it, as well as Vax and that guy there.
Laura: What about the magician guy?
Matt: If she's doing a perimeter? No.
Laura: Did you know that I was shooting at somebody?
Matt: She doesn't see the magician. Doesn't know where it is. "The Magician." The Prestige!
Liam: I have evasion.
Matt: Which means it's either half or nothing.
Liam: Right. At advantage because of the boots. What do I have to match?
Matt: Her DC, which is 21, right?
Marisha: 21.
Matt: Dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Oh yeah, way higher than that. We're good.
Matt: Yeah, you take no damage. You duck out of the Fire Storm just in time for it to (raging fire).
Marisha: I need two more d10s.
Liam: Yeah, dexterity save, man. Area effect.
Taliesin: Smoky d10 and spiky d10. And you get rerolls!
Marisha: I reroll ones. None of these are ones, unfortunately. (counting)
Darin: I just noticed the little lanterns glowing. Bravo!
Matt: Oh! Bravo to Dwarven Forge, man.
Sam: Well, it's your house.
Matt: True. Good torches you have in there.
Travis: Way to be energy-conscious with those LEDs!
Marisha: 39 fire damage.
Matt: 39 damage. This guy incinerates. He screams and burns. He manages to dodge partway out, but even the partial damage burns him and he (screams). You see him run off into the forest ten or so steps, on fire, like a stun man shot in a movie before he (impact) on the ground and smolders there in the distance. Those guys take it. What was the amount again?
Marisha: 39, and they're on fire.
Taliesin: It's hard to stealth when you're on fire.
Matt: They're both on fire.
Marisha: So that was my action. I'm going to do that out of my staff as I slam it down. I'm going to look at Sprigg and say: gods damn it, Sprigg! And I'm going to use that as my Healing Word, and I'm going to cast Healing Word at second level. Which is 2d4. 11 points to you. And then I'm going to use my free action that I have to turn into a fire elemental.
Matt: Your free action?
Marisha: Changing into something's not a bonus, it's a free action to change into my beast shape. Circle of the Moon, bitch!
Sam: Did you just call your fiancé--
Travis: -- a bitch?
Marisha: No! Combat wild shape.
Matt: Combat Wild Shape makes it a bonus action, as opposed to an action. That's the difference.
Liam: I would like to retract my "bitch," please.
Marisha: All right, so I'm just Keyleth.
Matt: Does that end your turn? All right, so as Keyleth's turn ends, it comes to Pike's. The entire exterior perimeter of this part of the house is on fire. Flames are now starting to catch. It is dry wood; the entire building is made from wood of the forest, so your home is now in flames.
Marisha: Wait, hang on. No, I'm doing the perimeter. I did think about this, which is why I didn't attack the guy in the house.
Travis: If you napalm the forest, the trees will probably catch fire.
Liam: It's a quick jump, though.
Matt: In order to do the perimeter, it's not a blazing inferno, but it's starting to catch. Flames are starting to lick up the sides.
Liam: End it quick, we can save it.
Matt: Fire Storm's a dangerous spell.
Laura: Let's try to save those books before they all burn.
Sam: He's an old guy. We were either going to kill him or burn his house down.
Matt: It's Vox Machina's MO, man!
Sam: It was always going to end this way.
Taliesin: Things you own end up owning you.
Darin: So glad I wore a jacket.
Matt: Pike is going to rush forward and is also going to attempt to Healing Word you at level two. It's a heal fountain on you. That is six plus five. That's 11 hit points you heal.
Sam: As soon as she does that, I grab him and we Dimension Door out the house.
Matt: Where do you Dimension Door?
Sam: To the only place I know  front of the house. Outside the front door. Not right outside, but towards the edge of the map there.
Matt: Over here?
Sam: Yeah, anywhere around there, on approach to the house.
Travis: Or do you want to be more over yonder?
Sam: Where's the front door to the house?
Marisha: Right there.
Sam: So I'd be 20 feet, the way we approached to the house. So where you got it, if that's the way we approached.
Matt: You guys approached this direction. So you're there. Make a perception check, Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. Ten.
Matt: Okay. You don't see the two hidden fellows over here. You see something large and hulking moving through the forest this direction, at a quick glance.
Sam: Is it naked?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Then we're going to be okay.
Matt: You guys have pulled out of that house. You're still on the ground and all of a sudden your body physically shifts, and you're looking up at the trees. You glance around and you can see the back of your house, you can hear the frantic fray going on. You see the necromancer who's currently covered in brambles and held in place. You see a couple of guys on fire, on the side screaming on the side of the house, and your house starting to catch fire. That's okay. Pike, on her turn, is going to--
Marisha: Keyleth has anger issues. It's fine.
Matt: Because it's a single target...
Sam: It's the "This is fine" meme, except it's just Keyleth.
Matt: She's going to cast a level five Guiding Bolt because that's what Pike does. So ranged spell attack against that guy. 11 plus-- yeah, that hits. That's a 21. So that is 8d6 radiant damage. Nice. 19.
Laura: Is she doing it to the magician?
Matt: No, this guy right there, in the room.
Sam: He's an illusionist, Laura.
Travis: Is she doing it against Copperfield? Is David Blaine with them?
Matt: So after she heals Sprigg, and Sprigg vanishes, she grabs her holy symbol and goes, "Chill out!" and shoots this giant flashing beam of divine energy that slams into it. You watch as a lot of its flesh burns away from the impact. It's still standing, but it's a shining beacon. The next attack against it has advantage. And then Pike's going to back up with you, Vex, towards the back where the bookcase is and goes, "You smell something?" You now hear, simultaneously, (slow thudding) and watch as the side wall and the back wall explode inward, as splinters of wood and stone (crashing) comes from this wall here--
Laura: Oh no, all of his stuff!
Marisha: So I didn't destroy your house first.
Liam: Flames! Flames, less of a thing.
Taliesin: On the side of the house.
Liam: Flames on the side of the house!
Matt: Two familiar hulking entities come barrelling into the chamber. Remember those giant things you saw walking through the Shadowfell that you barely avoided with the mask?
Marisha: The censer?
Matt: Who has the censer? Not on you right now. You don't carry a fucking giant smoking censer with you!
Laura: Oh, really? I didn't realize it was that big.
Taliesin: I think at that point, I think we put it in the Bag of Holding.
Sam: But you did make a bunch of those herbs.
Marisha: I do have the herbs.
Sam: And there's a shit-ton of shit on fire right now.
Matt: They burst through. (roaring) This big yell echoes through their metal masks. It sounds like this horrible-- imagine a giant vocal scream that's peaking on the audio level against a tinny metallic speaker.
Liam: (Bane voice) Your punishment will be more severe!
Matt: Essentially. This one's going to go after Keyleth. This one's going to make two swipes at Trinket because Trinket's right there. As they barrel through, part of the roof breaks. Guys up top, Percy and Grog, you feel the ground buckle a little bit below you and you drop about two or three inches as the building is starting to lose its physical frame.
Taliesin: Oh god, Grog, what did Keyleth do?
Travis: Thanks, Keyleth. You beat me by one second!
Taliesin: I'm well aware. It was totally worth it.
Marisha: #thanksKeyleth.
Matt: That's one's going to go ahead and do two slam attacks against Keyleth.
Marisha: Yeah, I've earned it. Come on!
Matt: That's 23 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah, that hits.
Matt: And that's a 29 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: That's 20 points of bludgeoning damage from the first hit. And the second one is 30 points of bludgeoning damage. (two slams) And it slams you. The second fist actually pins you up against the wall there, and you feel ribs crack inside your chest and now-- they're both down low in this hulking mass. They're almost wider than they are any other dimension with how they're crouched down and the thickness of their body. They're taking up almost the entirety of the room right now.
Marisha: You said 30 points, right?
Matt: Yes, for the second one.
Marisha: So I'm at 83 points.
Matt: Correct. The other one's going to slam twice into Trinket. Giant fists. That's going to be a 28.
Laura: 28 hits.
Matt: And a 22.
Laura: 22 hits.
Matt: That is five plus six. 11 points of bludgeoning damage to Trinket.
Laura: Halved.
Matt: Halved, correct. And 22 points of bludgeoning damage, halved.
Laura: Okay, so 11 plus six is 27 points.
Matt: That ends their go. We're at the top of the round. Percy, you're upstairs.
Taliesin: Okay, this all happened. That's awkward. That's okay, I know where I am. I'm going to run out onto the balcony really quick.
Marisha: There's room over here.
Travis: That guy's still up there with us, right?
Taliesin: Yeah. I figure you're going to handle him. Grog, take care of these two. What do I see outside on the balcony?
Matt: You see, currently down below-- make a perception check. Actually, you wouldn't even see them from your perspective.
Taliesin: I just rolled a natural 20.
Matt: Right, it's blocking your vision from this side. You do see Scanlan, you see Sprigg who is currently conscious, you see this necromancer who is currently held with brambles, and you see two streaking flames and hear screams on this side of the building.
Taliesin: Weird question, really quickly. Where is that giant log trap?
Matt: Right there.
Taliesin: How much swing does it have? Is it locked all the way over here, or is it hung back there?
Matt: It looks more like a drop.
Taliesin: Oh, so it's a drop on the door. Good to know. In the meantime, I'm going to run on the exterior of the wall, like right over here, if that makes sense. That's going to be my movement. I'm going to take some fun, happy pot shots at these bastards.
Laura: At the necromancer?
Taliesin: At the necromancer! Let's start with that bound necromancer. He's fun.
Liam: With the Vecna eye.
Taliesin: With the Vecna eye. He's bound, so I have advantage to hit him?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to use my Animus gun so I still have a hand open, and I'm also going to burn a point of grit so that I can get him to drop his staff. Here we go with advantage. Oh darn, it was so close. 28.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That's-- ooh! Fancy. 18 points of damage, four points of psychic damage, and he has to make a strength saving throw or drops his items.
Matt: Oh, don't worry, he drops the staff, because there's not much left of his head. When you hit the arm, the staff's clutching, but you slam it and it hits the side of the head and causes the right side of the face to explode against the tree, the brambles still clutching as it falls limp to the ground, and they crush the body into a small rock of flesh.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Marisha: You get a grit point back, right?
Laura: You get a grit point back, you get a grit point back!
Matt: You just barely see them; they have three-quarters cover. But you have sharpshooter.
Taliesin: Three-quarters cover, what does that mean in this crazy world? I'm going to burn a grit for advantage and shoot one of them.
Matt: The one right furthest on the side there?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'll start there. Let's give it a shot. I love advantage; it's so wonderful. 32. I really should have done extra damage. So that's 1d10 plus six. That hits, obviously. 32 to hit?
Matt: Yeah, that hits. Goodbye, necromancer.
Taliesin: 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: How much was that, sorry?
Taliesin: 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay. All right, he's still standing. (bullet impact, yelps) He starts looking up to see where the shot came from as the giant bullet wound through the torso and out the back of the shoulder was clean through. You hear him breathing, gasping for breath. (gasping)
Taliesin: I'm going to take another shot at him. I'm going to make this a sharpshooter shot, and again with advantage because that's fun. Here we go. Damn! Almost a crit. That's 29. That hits.
Matt: That hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: 14 points of damage-- I'm sorry, 24 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: He falls to the ground, face first. The second shot hits him in the chest. He just goes down, crumples. His body begins to smolder.
Taliesin: I use my bonus action to reload and stare at the nice person below me.
Matt: That ends Percival's turn. Grog, you're up. You hear, downstairs, the (heavy thudding). There's the guy in front of you who's like, (angry breathing). What are you going to do?
Travis: Can I smash my Titanstone Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself?
Matt: You can! And your head goes into the roof! (thudding)
Marisha: We're real sorry about your house.
Darin: It wasn't a house. It was a prison.
Laura: Well, then you're welcome.
Travis: I'm hoping the floor gives.
Matt: The floor gives out. As your head (crashing) into the ceiling (creaking, crashing) it falls out from under you. You come falling down on top of this guy. Rubble falls around. Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw. I need Trinket to make a dexterity saving throw. The other shadow ghast fails.
Marisha: Nine.
Laura: 14.
Matt: Trinket, you, and the shadow ghast all take 22 points of bludgeoning damage as the roof caves in over on top. Large part of the upper floor now falls and this guy stumbles and is now prone there. He also takes damage. You take 22 points of bludgeoning damage from falling through the wreckage. Trinket's is halved, yes.
Marisha: Ugh, debris, ugh!
Matt: That kills him. The shadow ghast right here.
Travis: Because he had barely any left.
Matt: Yeah. He's like, "Huh?" (crashing) Gets rained on with rubble, broken, splintered wood and stone.
Travis: The guy in Manners, he fell too, right?
Matt: His part of the ceiling didn't fully collapse. He's just out of the way. He's dangling off the edge right now, as he shakes, it's making its way towards the hole. The whole ceiling didn't collapse, just the area right below.
Travis: Beautiful. Can I take Tweedledee to my right and make two reckless attacks against him? They're not giants, right?
Matt: No, they're not giants. They're considered undead.
Travis: They're considered undead. 30 to hit. And the second one.
Matt: Big targets.
Travis: 29.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: So ten. 24 points. Plus the Enlarge-- 25.
Matt: 25 with the first hit. (whack)
Travis: 22 with the second one.
Matt: 22 damage on the second hit. (whacks) You're hitting him. Laying on its back, it has these metal spikes jamming out of its flesh. You can see portions of other creatures that it had slain that have been jammed on these spikes and rotted away on its armor. So as you're hitting it, you're knocking away parts of partially decomposed creatures that previously fell in battle to one of these creatures. As you're slamming into it, you can see it's just rippling, partially decayed muscle that seems to be unnaturally strengthened by whatever necrotic energy keeps it stitched together and alive. It's a thick sack of hit points.
Travis: Wow. Cool. Good to know.
Matt: Is that your turn; are you doing anything else?
Travis: That's interesting. I'm going to go into a frenzied rage as my bonus action.
Matt: Okay, and that's the end of your turn? Okay. End of Grog's turn. Vax, you're up. You heard all this go on and now the whole building is starting to catch fire.
Liam: I'm going to bolt to that window.
Matt: Right there?
Liam: No, other way. So I have a view of Keyleth, the creature, and Grog. I'm going to throw Whisper-- I've got sharpshooter-- at that thing, and bamf there.
Matt: I will say, at proximity to the flames that are starting to catch, you do take three points of fire damage.
Liam: Fine.
Matt: You threw the dagger at the big guy?
Liam: Whisper goes to the window at that guy there.
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Liam: And it's flanking, right? Because of where Grog is, or Keyleth?
Matt: It's not flanking, but you get to add sneak attack modifier.
Liam: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. That's 32.
Matt: Yeah, that hits. So you appear next to it.
Liam: Three plus psychic damage is four plus this junk. (counting) 33, doubled to 66 plus psychic damage is 74. Bamf there.
Matt: And you appear next to it. As the dagger sinks into its torso, you watch as its chest muscles and the iron cage-like armor around it seems to swallow the dagger. As it goes inside, you watch as some of the muscles all of a sudden (squelch) fall off of its body, like whatever energy's holding it together is untethered and this weird, fleshy, stitched-together creature is starting to fall apart. It's looking pretty hurt.
Liam: Okay, so here's what I wanted to do. So movement-- and I have action-action, action, action-- action-action, action, bonus action.
Travis: (repeating) Action, action--
Laura: (repeating) Action, action--
Marisha: (repeating) Action, action--
Liam: Guys, it's the rules in the book! You can bust my balls all you want--
Matt: Well, that's your first attack, so you have your second attack.
Liam: So action-action for my regular attack, right?
Matt: Attack-attack!
Liam: It's just semantics. Attack-attack, hasted action, bonus action. So that was the first of my attack-attacks. And here's the second one.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 30.
Matt: Well, we have dagger, dagger, dagger. Now we have attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack as our next t-shirt. (laughter)
Liam: I'm dumping a level two Smite into this, against an undead. That's seven, 10, 11. Ooh, it's cocked. 17 for that hit.
Matt: 17 with the additional--?
Liam: With attack-attack.
Matt: Right. Well, but you said you dumped Divine Smite into that?
Liam: Into that one.
Matt: You did the additional damage for it being undead? Okay, so that was how much total?
Liam: Whatever I just said. It was like 16.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. 17 will do it, actually. So as you rush in with the second dagger, you jam up into the same space where it's falling apart, and you hear this dull (shockwave sound) on the inside as the divine energy radiates from the strike and its body (slurping) sloughs off of the bones and around your arm. It slowly falls around your arm like old gelatin and (slurping) slips into the ground, covering the floor around you.
Liam: Okay, I'm going to do the old crouch. Not that she needs it, but crouch in front of Keyleth. And then I have my hasted action for an attack and bonus action for an attack into the other one. 29, and the second one is higher than 29. I'm going to dump Smite into it. Three-- you're making me mess up the math, Laura!
Laura: Psychic damage.
Liam: (laughing) I can't keep track of the math!
Matt: (singing) Epic-level DND!
Liam: 25 on that towards that guy, with Smite added. And then the last dagger, with Smite, at level one, is two plus is 10, 14, 19.
Matt: 19, okay.
Liam: I dumped a ton of Smite into that.
Matt: You didn't add your modifier to the third strike, right?
Liam: I don't know, so why don't you just minus six? 19, so we'll call it 13. Some people might have been catcalling me while I was trying to do math.
Matt: That's okay. No worries. You hit with the two final strikes. They blast into it. You watch as some of the armor gets thrown off its body. It takes a little hit, but the other creature looks like it's largely all right. That finishes Vax's turn.
Liam: Let me enjoy my last two months of life!
Matt: Shadow ghast. What's the DC on the sphere again?
Sam: 20.
Matt: Is it 20? 19. He can't escape from this freaking sphere. The shadow ghast is up on the second floor going (growling). Manners, man. All right. Scanlan and Sprigg, what do you guys want to do?
Darin: I have a question. The gentleman who had an arrow in his throat: he's gone, right? He's been blown apart.
Matt: Yeah. Actually, make a perception check.
Darin: Okay. That's a d20, isn't it?
Matt: Yep, d20 and then add your perception modifier.
Darin: Got it. That's a 17.
Matt: A 17, okay. You glance over and you see two guys who are hiding amongst the bushes on the side there.
Darin: Now, it's too far away to cast a spell.
Matt: No, depending on the spell's range, depending on what you want to do.
Darin: Tasha's Hideous Laughter.
Matt: That we can do.
Marisha: That's such a good spell.
Matt: It's a fun one. So bringing up Tasha's here, looking at the range. There we go. It's a 30-feet range, so you want to get up and get a little closer, probably.
Darin: I will do that, if I could.
Matt: All right, so that's half your movement, and you can move two more spaces. You can hit one guy. So one guy of these two you can select.
Darin: The first one.
Matt: That one there? All righty.
Darin: Yes. I think his name is Dave? Roll a perception?
Matt: Make a saving throw, a wisdom save. That is a ten! Your spell DC is a 17. You watch as the guy there who has his crossbow out and sees you get up, spins around, has this giant, heavy crossbow, the bolt very recognizable because you still have three of them in your body. Aims it towards you and then suddenly (maniacal laughter) and drops the crossbow to the ground and doubles over laughing, falling to the ground and is now kicking and laughing like a hyena right now, unable to do anything.
Darin: Knock knock!
Matt: (maniacal laughter)
Darin: Right! (laughter)
Matt: All right, is that your turn?
Darin: Yes, it is.
Matt: All right.
Sam: There's another guy over there? Have I seen him yet?
Matt: You haven't, actually. You do see this guy's on fire right now, who is still around.
Sam: Oh, I see somebody.
Matt: Yeah, and you can see that hulking figure come running through, and you hear the (explosion) through the back of the building.
Sam: For the beginning of the round, I'll say, guys, I think large giants are coming. Be aware.
Laura: (screaming)
Travis: (screaming)
Sam: What? I can't hear you! Speak clearly!
Liam: Threepio! Where could he be?!
Sam: Okay. Shit. I'll approach the guy I can see burning, on fire. That's where the front door is, right? Is he in front of the front door?
Matt: The log is right up in this area.
Sam: Oh yeah. That. So I'll take out my Wand of Magic Missiles, and I will just take down the rope.
Matt: Okay. You watch as three missiles fire out of the wand and slam into the bits of rope up top. As they explode, it's enough of an impact to cause it, as opposed to fall straight down, just spin and fall. I'm going to go ahead and roll a dice to see which direction it's going to land from its front point. So we'll say inward would be one, two, three, four, five, six. That's a six. So it plummets down, hits the ceiling, scrapes off and slams down onto him. He's going to try and make a dexterity saving throw. That is a seven plus four, nope. That's an 11. Go ahead and roll 4d8 please.
Laura: 4d8?
Darin: Is this Dr. Comedy, who's writhing in laughter?
Matt: I think so. Oh. No, sorry, he's over here. This guy's on fire from her earlier.
Sam: Oh, that's a five. 16.
Matt: 16 points of damage to him.
Sam: That's not a lot.
Laura: You only got 16 on 4d8?
Matt: It's not enough to kill him, but it slams on him and then falls over. You see as both of his flaming hands on the ground going, (groans). He's currently restrained underneath it right there, and on fire.
Darin: Knock knock. (laughter)
Matt: All right, you going to stay where you are?
Sam: No. I'm going to move towards any entrance or window I see. I can't really see over there.
Matt: There's a window here, window here. This one has flames in front of it. This one's available.
Sam: I'll go towards that [no audio] other one.
Matt: Okay. Four, five. That's as far as you can move there. You see the guy on the ground who's laughing in front of you.
Sam: Yeah, no thanks to him. And for a bonus, I guess I will inspire Darin De Paul, or rather, Sprigg.
Liam: Why not both?
Sam: I will sing to him, (singing) You had a bad day, you gettin' knocked down. I sing you a song just to turn it around! You say you don't know, but please don't die. I'll sing you this song and maybe you'll go for a ride. You had a bad day. (speaking) I don't know how that song goes.
Matt: All righty, so you get an inspiration die. You get a d12 that you can use on any sort of skill. You don't have to use it right now, but whenever you use a skill check or an ability check you can add that to it if you want to. There you go.
Darin: Thank you. You know, I had a bad day.
Sam: (singing) You had a bad day. (groaning and laughing)
Matt: All right, so now it's the assassin's turn. Keyleth, how much fire damage does it do when they're on fire? Is it d10?
Marisha: (stuttering) Oh jeez. Fire Storm. Yeah, no. d10.
Matt: Thought so. All right, he takes eight fire damage.
Taliesin: Yay! Under a log.
Matt: Under a log. He's going to try and break free from restraint. Nope, that is a 14. He cannot move that giant tree that's currently crushing him on the ground. He tries to reach out for his crossbow and aim it out towards Sprigg with one hand because it's still loaded. But he has super disadvantage on this strike.
Sam: Super disadvantage. Is that in the book?
Matt: It is now.
Laura: That's in the new campaign guide. Super disadvantage. Only when you're stuck under a tree on fire.
Matt: Sure, I'll do all three. All right. Eight, 12, 12. I made him roll super disadvantage. What does this remind me of? Like a terrible old sci-fi movie where the bad guy's on the ground with the gun trying to aim it at the hero with his final shot and the hero just walks up and steps on the gun. You (whoosh) sidestep the bolt as it fires. Nothing on you.
Darin: Of course.
Matt: The crossbow drops, (grunting).
Darin: Knock knock.
Matt: (crying) On fire. All righty, that ends his turn.
Darin: (whispering) Comedy comes in threes.
Matt: This guy back here is going to go ahead and since you're the one who has his friend writhing on the ground, is going to go ahead and try to shoot you with his crossbow. You do see him, although he's unaware of that, so he thinks it's a sneak attack shot. That is a 14.
Taliesin: You got to get better cultists, man.
Matt: I know, seriously. They come in large numbers, so yeah. This one just (impact sound) hits the tree to your left. His aim's off.
Travis: He's missing an eye. His depth perception sucks.
Matt: Exactly. And he goes ahead and darts behind this building there, vanishing.
Sam: Did I see the bolt or any indication that he exists?
Matt: You do. He reveals himself when he fires. So you watched him come out of the bushes and (whoosh) fire and then duck around the side of the building. The guy on the ground is going to try and save against your spell. That is a 13 plus zero. Nope. He's still laughing. He's just on the ground, (laughing). Tears in his eyes now.
Taliesin: I love that spell.
Matt: That's the end of the assassins' turn. Necro's dead. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark the big undead monster in the room. And then I'm going to shoot him! With the Blazing Bowstring!
Taliesin: Be careful. You might catch the building on fire.
Laura: Oh, but I'm going to use the sharpshooter thing.
Matt: Take minus five and do additional damage? Okay.
Laura: Which I don't know if I should have done that on this particular one. It was 17 to hit.
Matt: 17 is exactly his armor class.
Liam: Yas, Pelor queen! (laughter)
Laura: Five plus eight is 13. Plus sneak attack, because he's got Trinket next to him. 13, 18, 23, sorry! 23 and then lightning damage. 24. 25, 26. And then Blazing Bowstring. God dang! 27.
Matt: Okay, 27. So that's your first strike. (arrow shot) First one just (impact sound) hits in the side and you see the bolt of energy arc out and the flames burn up the arrow. By the way, the wall behind you is starting to get really warm.
Laura: I'm going to move forward. I'm going to actually move toward the corner where Keyleth is.
Matt: There's a guy on the ground there.
Laura: Oh, there is?
Matt: Yeah. So you've got to step over him.
Laura: I'm going to step on him.
Matt: As you move past, he does get a swing with his shortsword at you. Oh, wow. That's a 25.
Laura: Oh, wow. He hits me. Probably because I stepped on him.
Matt: I think so. So you take nine points of slashing damage. Just like, (pain sound) as you're walking past.
Laura: (pain sound) Fuck. Ah, shit. Okay, I'm going to hit the big hulking thing again.
Matt: I realized he had disadvantage, but I rolled another 18, so it's fine.
Laura: Oh, okay, well, yeah. I'm going to do the same thing with the big hulking guy.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 25 to hit.
Matt: 25 hits.
Laura: Oh, I didn't add plus ten to the previous one!
Matt: Because of the sharpshooter, all right. 39 last time. So go ahead and take a swing at it.
Laura: Thanks! 14.
Matt: You're up next, Keyleth.
Laura: 14 plus six is 20.
Sam: Figure out how you're going to ruin Darin's life more.
Marisha: I know. That's my one goal in life. I'm a big old homewrecker.
Laura: I think that's just 32 because I don't get sneak attack again.
Matt: All right. So the second arrow slams into him. It's still holding firm. It's taking the hits and you see parts of its body are starting to spill black liquid out of the wounds and (growls) its red eyes still beaming out from behind the metal mask in front of its face. Its arm swings back and tears some of the ceiling beams out with it. It's looking pretty rickety right now. So that ends your turn?
Laura: I guess so.
Marisha: Is it in a fireproof safe? No? Okay!
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: All right. So I have this big asshole in front of me, yeah? The house is catching on fire, right? Yeah. Nope, she'd still be really upset and really angry. So continuing what I was saying before, she's gonna rage a little bit more and go into her fire elemental self.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Unable to contain her frustration--
Taliesin: This is a good plan.
Matt: You technically entered the space of the guy who's on the ground, becoming a fire elemental, which lights him on fire. (screams)
Marisha: Even more upset. I'm gonna move right in the space of this guy.
Matt: (whoosh) So occupying his space from this side, we'll say. She can catch you guys on fire.
Laura: But she doesn't have to.
Matt: I'll double-check that real fast.
Marisha: I mean, I'm magical.
Taliesin: Sparkle fire.
Marisha: I sparkle fire.
Liam: Also, we can take it.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's fire.
Matt: You know what? It can move through a space as narrow as one inch wide, so I'll say yes, you can maneuver through. Only if you want to, can you set things on fire.
Marisha: I'm going to go into this guy's space, engulf in flames, and do my multi-attack, two slam touch attacks.
Matt: Go for it. He is now in flames.
Marisha: That's cocked. Ooh, that's good, that's good. 21.
Matt: 21, yeah.
Marisha: And 16.
Matt: 16 just misses.
Marisha: Fucking balls. Okay. No, plus six to 11. That's 17.
Matt: That hits. That's what you needed.
Marisha: So both of those hit. 2d6 plus three. First one is eight. Plus ten. 18 fire damage.
Matt: He's looking pretty hurt. As you slam him with both of your flaming hands and claw across his body, where the flame hits, you see it (hissing) singes through the flesh and drags charred remains of where the muscle once was where you dragged your claws through. The body's starting to shake as it's holding its form together.
Marisha: That's all I've got, I think. That's it.
Sam: No. You have action, action, action, action, action. (laughter)
Marisha: Bonus action.
Taliesin: Bonus action.
Laura: Hasted action.
Liam: Send all your complaints to Mike Mearls and Chris Perkins at Wizards of the Coast.
Sam: Matt, not to be a dick, but has anyone stepped on the trap on the floor?
Matt: Actually, you know what, Vax would have avoided it. Because Vax is in the spot where it was, but Vax knew where it was, so Vax would have probably gone over it.
Sam: So cool. You're doing the little splits over it.
Liam: Splitsing. Van Damme-ing it.
Matt: Wait, you wouldn't have, because when you threw the dagger--
Liam: Let's do it.
Matt: It's not a big deal. Thank you for pointing that out.
Sam: But your boots are gone.
Liam: She stole them again? How did you do it?
Matt: You guys glance upward as you hear a (deep swoosh) and up above you in the hole in the ceiling where there once was nothing but air, you see hovering above you a giant beholder just appear. (guttural moan) All of its eyestalks curling around it.
Marisha: What do you mean, it's not a big deal? That's the part that I'm confused about!
Matt: Thank you for that. So that finishes your turn, Keyleth. Pike's turn. Pike sees this--
Liam: If we're retconning that in, I'm retconning (blows raspberry) when I see it.
Darin: Don't get Gargamel angry.
Marisha: Does that mean that Keyleth would have seen the beholder beforehand? You know what, don't worry about it.
Matt: No. You were so angry-- it's in the hole above. You don't quite see where that hole was at the moment, you backed away.
Marisha: Man, so much blind rage.
Matt: So much blind rage. Look guys, that's what we're doing. So anyway, Pike does actually make an insight check, and says, "It's not real. Don't worry about it!"
Laura: Thanks, Pike.
Matt: Fixed. (laughter)
Laura: It's not a big deal, you guys.
Matt: Pike, however, is going to go ahead and make another Guiding Bolt at the large guy there. That's going to be a 20. That hits. That's going to be 4d6. 14 points of radiant damage, which will do it. So you watch as Pike blasts it in the face with the Guiding Bolt. As it hits, the mask gets thrown off, and where the head was beneath it, you see this empty black void with two red burning coals for eyes that blink out as soon as the mask is removed, and the whole body crumples to the ground and turns into a horrible, thick, black-purple ichor.
Laura: I'm going to have nightmares about that.
Sam: For sure.
Matt: The beholder is still upstairs, staying in place going (hoarse screaming). (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, it's that kind of thing.
Taliesin: Brilliant.
Matt: That ends Pike's turn. They're both dead. That brings us back. Percival, it's your turn. There's the one guy on the ground there. One's laughing. We'll say for the purposes of this, for the time, most everything there is not much of a threat at this point. So systematically, the guy on the ground who's hidden by the tree, you can just--
Taliesin: I'm ignoring him. I'm not even gonna deal. I'm just hopping in the window. I'm going to grab my little guy there. I'm going to bring him out to the balcony, and I'm going to unceremoniously toss him out of the house.
Sam: Defenestrated!
Matt: You throw him (thud). He lands.
Taliesin: And then I'm going to jump and I'm going to crawl down the rest of my way and join him outside the house. And try and jump around the fire, dragging him away from the fire.
Matt: Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics check.
Taliesin: Acrobatics? Bless you for an acrobatics check. I'm rerolling that.
Matt: No, it's not a saving throw. You can't do that.
Taliesin: It's not a saving throw. Oh well, that's fine. That's a 16.
Matt: I'll say for the purposes of this--
Taliesin: I had the Spider Climb boots.
Matt: Right, I know. But Spider Climb boots only helps you if you keep on the surface. So as you leap, you manage to land on your feet, but the flames do catch you a bit, so you take six points of fire damage as you start to burn. For the purposes of time on this one, the guy who's currently under the log just burns to death there under the log. Pinned, he's trying to reach for his crossbow, but he's only fired the one bolt that was loaded in it. The guy on the ground is still laughing as you approach him.
Darin: Are there any rocks about?
Matt: Yeah, there's quite a few heavier rocks on the ground.
Darin: Well, I look at him, and I say, "It was a prison, but it was my prison." And I use the Telekinesis ring to lift a rock and drop it on his head.
Matt: (splat) A horrible sickening crack sound. It slams into the head. You lift it up. The laughing has stopped, but he's still moving and you can see the face is broken. The nose is smashed to the side and it's just blood. He's starting to try and get back up.
Darin: Well, tell them that Ethred Brokenbranch sends his regards.
Matt: Do you let him get up?
Darin: Yes.
Matt: He gets up. (grunting)
Sam: I'll Lightning Bolt him as he runs away.
Matt: Okay, we'll say for the purposes of this, he runs off in the distance (footsteps, yelp) and falls to the ground, no longer moving.
Travis: Can I kill the guy on the floor? Can he be mine, please? Can I please smash him? The guy that's lying on the floor in the house, please?
Taliesin: Just sit on him.
Travis: I haven't Gallaghered anybody in a while.
Matt: He's on the ground on fire now, going (frantic gasps) patting out the fire.
Laura: Oh, Grog, put him out!
Matt: He spends his action putting the fire out now, and is like, (frantic gasps).
Marisha: Keyleth takes a few steps back and motions as a fire elemental...
Travis: I skip on in and (gibberish yell).
Matt: He's like, (scream, impact). Just smashed on the ground. Red watermelon.
Laura: Fire's out, I'm assuming.
Marisha: I drop my fire form, turn, see my anger, destruction, get immediately guilty, and then do a Tidal Wave to quell the flames.
Matt: The building is standing, mostly. The whole front of it is blackened. The flames are gone. Most of the interior is destroyed. You have two giant holes in the back. Most of the upper ceiling is ruined. The house is in shambles.
Laura: What about the books?
Matt: A lot of them have been destroyed. Some of the ones on the back wall have been burned. Some of them have been burned by people in flames or made of flame or general black ichor that spilled out. The house is pretty wrecked.
Laura: Can I go over to them and see if I can find some books I think Percy would like?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: I'm running over to see that staff with an eye in it.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27? Okay. You start glancing through. You find some history books. You find some that relate to local history. You see some books that relate to various types of creatures; some animals and beasts. Many that are encyclopedias of various rivers and it's scattered everywhere. It's just universal knowledge of pretty much anything he can get his hands on. So some of it seems less useful than others but you hand-pick a few out that you think Percy would like.
Travis: I don't mean to ask the obvious question, but how did he know we were here?
Taliesin: No, that's not an obvious question. I have no idea.
Marisha: They have multiple eyes.
Laura: But how? Was he watching us? Is he scrying on us?
Taliesin: Must have.
Laura: Oh, he's fucking scrying on us.
Taliesin: Maybe he can feel you the way you can feel him.
Matt: You get the sense that's not how this works.
Taliesin: Yeah. I don't know.
Marisha: He had another eye, right?
Sam: Does that thing have an eye in it?
Matt: The staff you see? It's a carved eye. It's made of wood and paint. It's ornamental. It's mainly used as a focus, technically acts as a plus-one staff.
Travis: Sprigg. You said this place was a prison. Did you mean that?
Darin: Of course I meant it, boy. I've been there for years.
Travis: Could you leave? If you wanted.
Darin: Of course I can. The prison was more up here than in there.
Travis: Oh. Sorry about the prison, then.
Darin: Why would you be sorry? I asked you for power and redemption. Don't you feel you gave me that? We lived, child. We all lived.
Travis: Yep. Yes. That is indeed what I was hoping for.
Laura: I lean out the window. Hey, Sprigg!
Darin: Hello!
Laura: Hi.
Darin: Hi! How are you? I have some arrows in me at the moment. You like arrows, don't you?
Laura: I do. Come in here, I'll take them off your hands.
Darin: Okay. Question  if you do that, I'd probably die again.
Laura: I'll cure you, darling. Don't worry.
Darin: She called me darling.
Sam: She's the cutest.
Darin: (growls) I go in. (laughter)
Matt: You walk into your destroyed abode, managing to sidestep all the bear traps along the way. You've walked the path many times and you know it and I'm actually surprised none of you walked into any of them. You knew where most of them were, but none of you wandered out far enough into the open to do that. They're all inside. You can see your giant friend, of course, that you were talking to as you walked in is twice the size he was earlier. Previously where you had to hunch, you're now having to almost belly crawl inside the house.
Travis: But why? There's no separation between the first and the second floor.
Matt: So if you stand in that space, you're fine.
Travis: I'm in my space.
Taliesin: I'm going to prop our idiot up in the window so I can go in and keep an eye on him even while I'm inside.
Sam: We have a prisoner?
Taliesin: Yeah. I kept one.
Laura: But he's one of those creepy ghouls that probably doesn't speak.
Matt: And in the last minute or so has not been able to break free but is still trying.
Taliesin: He automatically fails until 24 hours has elapsed.
Matt: After the first failed save?
Taliesin: Any further attempts by the creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed. He ain't going nowhere. It's mean, man.
Laura: Me and Pike can heal him as I take the arrows out.
Matt: Okay.
Darin: At last you've seen the point of me, eh?
Laura: (sarcastic laugh) Sprigg, anything valuable in here that you want to save before we get you out of here?
Darin: Would like my organs! Oh, I would like to save those.
Laura: Yes.
Darin: All right. No. There's nothing.
Laura: No keys to Ioun? You know where she is?
Darin: I might. I hope I do. I hope that I can give you the answers you seek.
Laura: I hope so, too. I cast Cure Wounds.
Matt: Pike casts Cure Wounds on you, as well, and you heal 18.
Darin: Do I know her name yet?
Matt: No, you do not.
Darin: Cleric.
Matt: "Pike."
Darin: Yes. Ethred. Or Sprigg. Whichever you like. You can call me Sprigg. Can you help me pray to Ioun? We need answers, and I think together we might find them.
Matt: "I can certainly try. Do you have any items of her iconography?"
Darin: Do I?
Matt: Yeah, actually. You just reach over and find one of the undamaged books.
Laura: You healed 19, by the way.
Darin: Thank you. Use this and you talk to her where I can't. At least, not yet.
Matt: "I don't know if I can talk to her. I'm not... But I can help you pray. I don't know if it'll be enough."
Darin: Let's give it a go. There's a first time for everything.
Matt: "Grog!"
Travis: Yeah?
Matt: "Can you help me clear some of the floor, please?"
Travis: Not a problem! (grunting) Keyleth, catch!
Marisha: Ah! Ow! (laughter)
Sam: Floorboards! In her face!
Travis: I thought you were on fire. I'm really sorry.
Matt: Pike takes you over to the center of the room and tells you. "Kneel with me. Now take this book and close your eyes and... apologize."
Darin: For what?
Matt: "For everything you said about Ioun."
Darin: (grumbles) All right. Well, look the other way. Find some things that are of value.
Travis: (whistles)
Laura: Trinket sits down next to him and stares, but I'll turn around.
Darin: All right. I don't know if you're listening, Ioun. It's been many years since I've actually spoken to a god. I'd like to express my deepest sorrow. You see, this home... didn't mean as much to me as life. And I think these people gave that to me. If you could give us... If you could give me anything, any little hint, it would be greatly appreciated and I would be a warrior in your name forevermore. Please. Was that okay, bear?
Matt: (huffs, licking) Licks the side of your face.
Darin: No, I'm not crying. You're crying, bear.
Matt: You sit there in silence with your eyes closed, concentrating, holding the book before you. Doesn't seem to be an answer. Just silence in the darkness. Nothing. Everyone wants to look at him-- still turned away?
Marisha: Keyleth is definitely staring, but pretending not to stare.
Taliesin: I'm watching through the book.
Laura: I'm leaning against the wall and staring at him now.
Matt: Nothing. Nothing responds. As you have your eyes closed, you hear this soft chuckle in the far corner of the room. (cackles) "Really? Praying, are you?"
Darin: Yes. Can you help?
Matt: "Do I look the kind of guy that would help?"
Darin: Yes. I've known you for 19 years and I think anybody's capable of anything, so why don't you do something unexpected?
Matt: "I think you're right. It's no longer your prison. It's not mine, either."
Darin: That's true.
Matt: (flapping) Flies out the window.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Darin: Kraghammer has another performer, and not a very good one.
Matt: While you've been talking, by the way, and the silence has been sad. Taking in the slight emotional cut that not getting a response and putting yourself on that limb means nothing. The rest of you notice his torso is glowing bright blue.
Marisha: What? Is it really?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Your stomach is glowing.
Darin: Growing? What? I didn't eat anything. How could my stomach be growing?
Sam: You're blue balling.
Darin: What?
Sam: (whispering) Look down.
Matt: Pike looks at you and takes your hands and opens your arms and motions to your chest. And the book in your hand, you pull aside. You glance down and you can see, there's this soft, bluish glow that's emanating from your torso. Strange.
Darin: You see? I didn't have to believe in Ioun. I've found my religion. (chuckling) I'm Bluish! (laughter)
Travis: Aw, man!
Darin: It didn't happen!
Matt: No, it did. That's canon.
Darin: Wait a second, gentlemen. We'll restart for just a second. It'll be fine. That little imp is gone. So apparently, the key... is me.
Laura: Is you? It is you.
Sam: Is in you or is you?
Marisha: It is him. I've known it from the minute that I laid eyes upon him. It's him.
Travis: You did? You knew that the moment you saw him?
Marisha: No, I mean I had a hunch, I had a feeling, deep down inside. I can't say it. If I say it out loud and then if it's not true then I'm an asshole.
Liam: To be fair, we've only been here 12 minutes.
Darin: Yes. House gone. The imp gone. Burny, burny. Sad, sad. Pray, nothing happened. Now I'm blue. That's a day for you, isn't it?
Laura: So do you glow brighter the closer we get? What's the deal here?
Darin: I've never glowed before, child.
Laura: I think it's glown.
Darin: I've never glowned.
Sam: If you're the key, where's the lock? Where do we take you?
Darin: Well, I have been gone for many, many years, so English may have changed. To be fair. To be fair. I don't know. This is all new to me. I would have thought it would be in one of those tomes.
Taliesin: I'm going to pick up the book that he was holding when he was praying. I'm going to just try and read it.
Matt: Okay. You glance through it. The book is a simple book, talking about the construction of barricades and it looks like it was less the contents of the book and more just the image of the book itself.
Taliesin: I'm going to hand him the book again and see if maybe there's focus to be found. Maybe this is--
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: Oh, lord. Ooh. Let's call that a 28.
Matt: When you took the book from him and handed him another book, there was a very faint vibration to his body as you pulled it from him and gave it back to him. Which you haven't noticed, but there's a physical vibration to him.
Taliesin: If it's all-- with your permission, I'm going to take his hands.
Matt: Okay. You feel them, and you feel this very faint vibration to his body.
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Continue holding his hands. I pull out the Tome of Quick Movement. Hold. Hold while I find the paper. Hold.
Laura: What if he's a tuning fork?
Marisha: (shushes)
Darin: That's very rude.
Marisha: Where is it? I have a lot of things.
Sam: Divining.
Darin: Oh yes. A divining rod. A rod to the divine. Perhaps I am a divining rod.
Laura: That's what I mean.
Darin: Well said, child!
Marisha: I pull out the fork we that we got to get to Elysium. Is it similar?
Matt: When you pull out the fork and you hold it, you recall that whenever you cast the spell Plane Shift, there was a faint vibration to the specific fork when you cast the spell.
Sam: He's the tuning fork.
Taliesin: He's the tuning fork.
Marisha: Oh no.
Laura: What, no? This is good!
Marisha: No, it is good. It's good, it's just... Oh, Sprigg. No, it's fine. It's good. I don't know. Everything in my life seems to have this impermanence factor about it. So I hope he's not something that can be used and discarded.
Darin: I haven't been used in 37 years.
Marisha: Sprigg.
Darin: It's all right. At least I wasn't discarded all that time.
Marisha: I'm sure it's fine, I just--
Darin: Look. Look at me. Just remember. Whatever happens, remember me. That's all that's important.
Liam: That's good advice.
Darin: That's all that we have. My friends are gone and I don't even remember their names. I don't remember Thetapax or Zephyr or... the guy with the nose. He was my favorite. (coughs and sniffles) Dusty in here, isn't it?
Marisha: Oh, Sprigg.
Darin: (sniffles and coughs) I remember. (softer) I remember. See? It's all up here. So whatever happens, keep me there. All right?
Marisha: I guess I have to start getting used to losing things.
Darin: Yes. Or you can be hidden away in a prison for 37 years. And that's not life, child. That's hiding. Don't hide.
Marisha: I've already built my own prison. They don't know. I'm already there.
Darin: You can break out. You can. It's hard. But you can do it. Just take the first step. And then you take another one. And then you take another one.
Marisha: And I grab his hand, and with that, I cast Plane Shift to wherever he is leading to go.
Matt: All right. The rest of you gathered hands for this?
Laura: I guess so.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Is there enough of us? Trinket, in the necklace. Quick!
Matt: Trinket. (roars) Into the necklace.
Darin: Wait. My invisible frog companion.
Sam: Is he real?
Darin: Yes. (laughter)
Matt: There is a sudden (sucking noise). A shuddering of power energy around you as you feel the vibration out of Sprigg's hand emanate throughout the entire loop you guys have created throughout your grasp. The familiar bright light flashes before you, and you feel your body being pulled through, at incredible speeds, through darkness. There. The familiar racing of the divine gate. (fast travel noise) As you pass through one of its many portholes. Then, adrift. By now you've-- the times you've passed through the gate, you've passed through it a handful of times since now. Adrift. Still holding hands, but the circle's beginning to turn into an oval. You can all glance around and see each other. Did you miss your destination? Did you overshoot? What's next? (whoosh) Another white flash. And suddenly you're at a destination. You glance around and you're standing within a small chamber. It resembles a decadent bathhouse but with no water nor occupants. It's empty. There are marble pillars stretching to a domed ceiling about 60 feet above you all. Silk-draped cloths drift and hang at odd angles throughout the ceiling. Glowing points of magical light latched within iron cages dangle at the edges of these pillars about 15 feet up that give the faint glow to an otherwise darkened room. There are walls on each side of this chamber, about 30 or 40 feet from you, and one arched hallway across from you that leads to the only other chamber you've seen.
Marisha: I immediately turn and look to see if Sprigg is still holding my hand.
Matt: Sprigg is still holding your hand.
Laura: See? All that fucking shit was for nothing! He's still alive!
Sam: Are you the same Sprigg as before?
Darin: I hope so. Let's ask my invisible frog companion. Well, I guess we'd better go find what we are looking for.
Marisha: Okay. Glad you're with us, Sprigg.
Darin: It's good to be alive.
Marisha: Yes, it is.
Darin: Remember that.
Marisha: Okay. I will.
Matt: As you guys walk forward towards the singular hallway, you go through the domed arch, and the hallway extends on. Featureless, smooth grey marble. Like a solid punch that seemed to have carved out whatever this material was. It extends for 100 feet. 150 feet. And even though there's very very faint light, and many of you can see through darkvision, there is a darkness about 60 feet from you that seems to consume what you can see. You can only see so far beyond that radius, and you're not quite sure where that oppressive shadow is coming from. The air is chilled, but not uncomfortably so. You can hear the distant sound of pinched winds whining through small spaces. A familiar sound from the many times you've spent underground, through caverns that had some openings that allowed air to streak through to the surface. A few steps more and suddenly the hallway opens into a second chamber. Into a library, if you could even call it that. Bookshelves that stretch upward for seemingly hundreds of feet, before flickering lights fell from your vision. You do not see where they stop. These columns of just tomes and cases and scrolls and parchments stacking as in tablets and any form of recorded information seem to just be infinite in front of you, to two sides of this road and upward. They seem to stretch in almost every direction, the walls to the side of you. You see columns ahead of you, and they tend to wind and curl like a labyrinth made of bookcases, to no end. It's very Escher-esque in how the further up you look, they tend to curve and shift and bend around each other. Your eyes, now attuned to the realms beyond mortality, you catch glimpses of shifting wind gathering books and turning pages. Spirits of the library, though sparse as they may be from this entry point, organizing. Reading and learning from whatever words are within. You begin to almost get vertigo, trying to contemplate the strange and overwhelming construction of such a wondrous place. An endless sea of stories. Spectral custodians keeping the tales of each other and the history of Exandria past, present, and binding the pages to tell what will eventually be the present, currently the future.
Taliesin: I've dreamed of this place.
Liam: Inside Matt's brain?
Taliesin: This is immortality. This is everything. (sighs, chuckles) I may never leave. I glide over to Vex and hold her close. This is stunning. My god, I think they may have actually forgotten all the idiot things I said yesterday.
Laura: Feels pretty good, doesn't it?
Taliesin: I think they've completely forgotten. I'm sorry. May have panicked.
Laura: I give him a kiss.
Taliesin: I'll be right back. I'm going to run towards one of those stacks, like a child.
Matt: Okay. You begin to take the first--
Taliesin: I'm doing a title run. I want to figure out the organizational system before I touch a book.
Matt: There are no words on any of the spines.
Taliesin: I pick one.
Matt: Okay. You pick.
Taliesin: All right. I pick it up. I look around to see if anybody has a problem. And I turn to the title page.
Matt: It's ironic you do this, because the book is in Celestial.
Taliesin: I read Celestial.
Matt: You do. It's ironic that you did that. (chuckles) Glancing through, it appears to be describing a birth. Describing a tunnel, then a light, then a cry.
Taliesin: I skip to the end. Last page.
Matt: It seems to be an older man, surrounded by his family--
Taliesin: I've got it. I put it down. I pick up another one.
Matt: You glance through this book.
Taliesin: First page.
Matt: Begins very similarly to the last one.
Taliesin: Last page.
Matt: This one actually ends with what appears to be a horseback riding accident.
Marisha: Oh god, they're souls.
Taliesin: 115 pages in.
Matt: 115 pages in you get to a page that seems to talk about the sorrow of a lost romance, and trying to deal, coping at a young adult age.
Taliesin: I put it back and I turn. They're made of people.
Laura: Wait, what? It's skin books?
Taliesin: It's people! And I'm going to find the most interesting spine and I'm going to turn to the first. Birth. Death.
Laura: I can't read that, dear.
Taliesin: Birth! Death! Sex. Birth, death, some disappointment. I am just gone. I'm running back and forth, finding whatever interesting spine I can. Are they all in Celestial?
Matt: They are currently. All the ones you've picked up are in Celestial.
Taliesin: Oh my god. Okay. This is great. All right. I'm eventually probably going to pass out from mild hyperventilation and have to sit down.
Laura: We should maybe find Ioun, don't you think?
Taliesin: If we must, yes. Just as an experiment, I'm going to think about Vesper and try and touch a book. I don't expect this to work, but I'm going to close my eyes and think about, and pick it up and flip through it.
Matt: Make a religion check.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: You grab a tome and pull it forth, and as you read through the story, it's an unfamiliar one.
Taliesin: There's a system. I will discover the system. I'm going to keep running around like a kid.
Matt: What are the rest of you guys doing while Percival is running around like a kid?
Travis: I'm not interested in the fucking books.
Marisha: Distracted by Percy, Keyleth just scans. Does anything in Primordial stick out?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: That's good. 29.
Matt: Glancing about, none of the spines have anything written on them, so you have to start pulling a few books out and opening them.
Marisha: I hold my hand over and pull.
Matt: You open it up. It's not in a language you understand.
Marisha: I put it back and get frustrated.
Taliesin: I've stopped. I'm good.
Liam: Watched her the whole time and quietly walk up behind and give her a hug from behind and don't say anything.
Sam: Are there any doors leading forward or back?
Matt: It's a labyrinth of bookshelves. There's a path forward between, two or three ahead of you, but then it comes to an end where it splits off in two directions. Like I said, they travel up infinitely, so you're not quite sure which way leads where.
Laura: Is Sprigg still glowing?
Matt: Sprigg is, actually-- There's a very faint blue glow in him that never really faded since your arrival.
Laura: I wonder if we could follow the glow. Warmer?
Marisha: Hey, Sprigg. Stand over there!
Darin: All right. I run to where she's pointing. Is there any change in the glow?
Matt: No noticeable change.
Marisha: Damn. Sprigg, stand over there!
Darin: I just was shot with a bunch of arrows, so give me a second. I run over there, stop halfway and go, ow, and then I continue. When I get there, any change in the glow?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Darin: Oh, it's a one.
Matt: No discernible difference.
Sam: You're inspired, if you want to use inspiration.
Matt: It's a natural one. It's an auto-fail.
Taliesin: Is there a card catalog?
Sam: Is there a central area info desk?
Matt: You can make an investigation check to begin to wander around and try to find your way.
Sam: Oh, that's a natural 20.
Matt: Scanlan seems to walk with purpose into one of the random rows.
Sam: I'm clutching my Ioun stone.
Matt: Okay. All right. Anyone else do anything?
Taliesin: He seems to have purpose. I'm giddily following behind.
Matt: Okay, Percy's following Scanlan.
Laura: I'm going to walk with Percy. Oh, and Trinket's out.
Matt: Okay. Trinket (bear grunt) looks confused and starts looking up.
Laura: I know. I know, dear.
Matt: Falls onto his back.
Sam: Are Vex and Percy walking with me?
Matt: Yes, they are.
Sam: I'm going to whip out my flute and I start going, (wedding march).
Taliesin: Oh. He may have heard.
Laura: He heard?
Taliesin: I thought you were going to die! I may have panicked.
Laura: Wait.
Taliesin: We were asked to plead for your life, and I may have panicked.
Laura: Who did you tell? Percival, who did you tell?
Sam: Look at your shirt.
Laura: What? (screams) No!
Taliesin: I panicked!
Laura: Percy!
Taliesin: I panicked! There was a giant glowing sun, and I may have panicked. Well, I was a bit vague, but I was--
Laura: A bit vague? Scanlan, what did he say?
Sam: Well.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Sam: First comes love. Then comes marriage.
Taliesin: I may have hinted that we might have eloped. May have hinted.
Sam: Wait, you're married?
Taliesin: I may have hinted.
Sam: Wait, no, you said you were betrothed to be married? Wait, you're married? Oh, wow, you just spilled it!
Taliesin: Silence! Cone of Silence!
Sam: They're married!
Matt: You try and yell, and it's making no sound. It is just absolute quiet. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Darin: I run in the corner and see if I glow again.
Liam: Keyleth and Vax heard the (wedding march), so we had a very different silent scene over in our spot.
Marisha: Yeah, Keyleth was quietly sobbing in Vax's arms and then heard (wedding march) and went (angry roar).
Laura: Why is that bad? Why was that angry?
Liam: Because we don't get that.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Grog?
Sam: So you're going to ruin everyone else's joy. You're one of those couples.
Liam: Thank you, vacation Scanlan.
Marisha: Worst double date sangria partners ever.
Taliesin: He's back, ladies and gentlemen. He's back and taking no prisoners.
Sam: Are you guys going on vacation? We got a divorce.
Liam: It's the Debbie Downer SNL sketch.
Matt: Grog, what are you doing?
Travis: I'm as uncomfortable as I can possibly be. This is the worst-case scenario of my entire life. I'm not moving and hoping this is all over soon.
Taliesin: I love that.
Travis: It's just endless books, beyond what you can see! Are there chairs?
Laura: I feel like Pike would've comforted him.
Matt: Yeah, Pike comes over.
Travis: There are chairs?
Matt: No, there aren't. She goes, "Do you want to go with everyone else, Grog?"
Travis: I don't know. Do you?
Matt: "It's okay, yeah! They're walking."
Travis: I want to leave. Fast.
Matt: "The faster we follow them, then the faster we can go."
Travis: Okay. Let's go.
Matt: "I bet you could read some of these books."
Travis: I bet not. These are really tall books.
Matt: "Come on." She grabs your hand and begins tugging you behind her. What are you guys doing?
Marisha: Me and him?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Leaning into each other.
Matt: Okay. So you guys stay there.
Darin: I'm trying to see if I'm glowing anywhere.
Matt: You run around for a good minute and a half and you're not seeing any sort of change.
Darin: Nothing?
Matt: No.
Darin: Can I go forward into the bookcases and look right and left to see where they lead?
Matt: Okay, yeah. You turn around the corner and see them disappear around the edge.
Darin: I'll continue.
Matt: Okay. So you follow them. As you guys are having this silent argument, Sprigg catches up to you, but you hear nothing, Sprigg, as they're all going...
Taliesin: I just turned it off. I got everyone to agree.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hi. How's it going?
Darin: Glowing. You are, too! What's going on with that? Yeah, you seem to be blushing.
Laura: It's so hot in here. It's very hot in here.
Matt: Pike and Grog catch up around the corner.
Travis: What did you find? The way out? Exit?
Sam: Seems like it could be this way. We'll have to band together and go forward.
Travis: Really?
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: Where did you get the sunglasses from?
Sam: It's glowing in here.
Matt: The Ioun stone actually is giving a faint glow similar to the glow that you see emanating from Sprigg's torso.
Sam: Is it glowing any more than--
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh, okay. That's an eight. Maybe 11, I don't know. Do I add Jack of All Trades?
Matt: You do, yeah. If you're not--
Sam: I really want to know. I will inspire myself, and I'll add a d12. That makes it 16.
Matt: Okay. You start getting the sense, the further you walk, both your stone and Sprigg are beginning to emanate a slightly stronger glow, and so you guys begin to realize that this could be used as a path to something. You're not quite sure.
Sam: Let's keep going.
Matt: Okay. So everyone's going behind.
Liam: Imagination clarification, because a Silence effect went off there. Did Vax and Keyleth hear, "You're married?" Or was that all covered by Silence?
Matt: No, he crushed that in Silence.
Liam: So we heard the song, but that's it. Good to know.
Matt: Everyone else has gone ahead and vanished into the library. You guys are staying?
Liam: Noticing that we're totally alone, silently tug Keyleth down after them.
Taliesin: I felt that honesty was important at that moment.
Laura: No, it very much is. I'm very glad. I'm just surprised he didn't say anything. I spoke with him.
Sam: He was acting nobly. I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to.
Taliesin: We had to tell them eventually.
Matt: As you're following the stone, you hear some footfalls as Vax and Keyleth catch up to you guys.
Marisha: We already know. It's fine.
Liam: You're engaged. You don't have to--
Taliesin: Well.
Laura: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about that. Engagement. But you know.
Marisha: You fucking liars. You fucking liars! Just tell us! We know!
Laura: We got married.
Taliesin: We may have gotten married.
Marisha: Yeah. (sarcastically) Oh, surprise!
Taliesin: It was going to be--
Laura: (weakly) Celebration!
Taliesin: We didn't want to make it a thing. We wanted it to just be--
Sam: I think it's great.
Laura: Thank you, Scanlan.
Sam: It's wonderful when two people can fall in love and have each other forever and ever. That's nice. No, I mean it! You guys are great. You're super cute together. You'll make Whitestone-- You'll be celebrities there.
Travis: Do we have to get you gifts?
Sam: No, they eloped, so we're clear.
Taliesin: Very specifically, no. This place.
Marisha: Yeah, it's amazing. And Keyleth lights up her flame hands as she walks off in a fury.
Taliesin: Do you not know what this place means? Am I the only one who understands what this place means?
Travis: I would love to know.
Taliesin: It all matters!
Laura: None of us have forgotten.
Taliesin: No, I mean, really! It all matters! So much, and it's not going to go away! Nothing goes away!
Marisha: No, it only gets filed away in some library where no one else can experience it except for, what, one, maybe two people ever.
Taliesin: One and two people are all that it takes to experience something!
Matt: An echoing voice billows out from the right side of your troupe. A creaky, warm, matronly voice that surrounds and almost welcomes you with the intonation of a grandmother. It says, "Nothing is forever, Percival." You glance off to the right, and you can see there's a break in the bookcase. To your right, you see the shelves have stopped ahead in this direction to reveal a circular common area within the library, where the ground domes downward into an 80-foot-wide concave pit of cushions and tables, all standing at odd angles alongside this pit, but never sliding. Gravity seems to shift depending on where the dome stands. These tables hold teacups and writing implements and various other décor, and things that involve binding and writing. None of them slipping, all of them affixed to the table as the dome slowly comes to a central rest. Long, spiraling streams of silver, blue, and gray silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight, and they come down like drifting silks that push past as you enter the area. Sitting 40 feet from you in the center of the dome, no larger than a normal person, is an older woman with long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is somewhat weathered and wrinkled around her almond eyes, but the warmth of her smile, and her vibrant purple irises put you at ease immediately. Her blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that snake through the pillows like roots. She smiles as you turn and see her. "I felt that you would find me." And that's where we'll end tonight's session.
Sam: Wow, Matt. Wow, Darin!
Liam: Can everybody watching still at home give a round of applause for Darin?
Matt: Seriously. If you're available, you may want to, if you can, come and join us for the first half maybe. Not next week, but the week after Comic Con, if you're interested. Because I want to roleplay out you meeting Ioun.
Darin: It would be an honor. You know how important this is to me.
Matt: Great. I'll look forward to having you back in a couple weeks, then.
Darin: And I will see you next weekend, as well!
Matt: Yes, indeed. Oh, Comic Con. Guys, thank you so much. Great game, well done. Breaking stuff, apparently. Once again, we have no episode next week because we'll be at Comic Con, but we have our panel on Saturday for Critical Role. Love you guys, hope you have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Good night! [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hi, everyone! Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Good job, Sam. Thank you for your patience. Sorry we were off last week. I'm doing much better, for those who are worried about it. Happy to be back. Missed you guys, and happy to be back at this table. So yeah! It's been a couple of weeks. Let's go ahead and get into some announcements real fast. First off, tonight we have our fantastic sponsor, Shadow of War!
Travis: Shadow of War! Oh shit!
Laura: Are we allowed to say what we did in it?
Matt: Yeah, a number of us actually worked in the game. It comes out October 10th, actually.
Sam: And the full name of the game is Middle Earth: Shadow of War, for all of those who are looking for it alphabetically.
Travis: The sequel to Middle Earth  Shadow of Mordor.
Sam: Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling our asses off. I played a little character known as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording sessions.
Travis: I remember talking to you! I was Commanding Orc 1.
Sam: Oh, nice.
Matt: I was Professional Orc 1, as well as the Witch King of Angmar, the head of the Nazgul. I'm pretty excited about that.
Laura: Oh, nice!
Liam: I was Troy Baker's fluffer. It's prestigious.
Sam: You were in it, right? No?
Liam: I'm in the first one.
Sam: Oh, what did you do in the first one?
Liam: The thing I killed two weeks ago? That was me.
Sam: Laura, were you in it?
Laura: I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel.
Liam: You play a sword?!
Laura: I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf, right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be about my character.
Sam: Do you have a number after your character?
Laura: No, it's the only one. It's the coolest thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and Vax.
Matt: That's pretty great.
Laura: No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick. So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and she wears feathery armor. It's so freaking cool! So basically, it's like if Vax was a girl, which is Vex.
Travis: But with the sex appeal of Grog.
Laura: Of course, baby.
Matt: I will never forget being at the Shadow of War panel at Comic Con, and you mentioning the DLC and then going, "Has that even been announced yet?" And there was five seconds where I watched Laura wither away into a shell of a human before they went, "Oh, yeah, it's announced." And you reverted.
Laura: Even at this very moment, as I said it, aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?"
Liam: They scare you so bad that, even when it's official, I'm like "I'm in the--"
Travis: It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. We can testify.
Sam: We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right into the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us.
Travis: And make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order.
Matt: By the way, if you haven't played the previous game, the Nemesis system is one of the coolest things I've played in many games in a long time. I'm going to challenge you guys to try and pick out not only who you voice orc-wise, but then to try and make sure our orcs rise to the very top. So you have nothing but generals from Critical Role. I challenge you for this. Because that would be pretty cool.
Liam: I hope you like hearing the word ranger.
Liam: Ranger!
Travis: Ranger!
Laura: Ranger!
Matt: It's going to be fun. All right, thank you, Shadow of War for being our sponsor tonight. We're excited about the game, and hope you are, too. Also, there's been a lot of insane weather tragedies that have been in the news recently. I want to make sure that everyone knows that if you want to help support relief for both of the hurricanes that have come and torn through the U.S., we have a link to the Red Cross to donate and be part of that. It'll be available in the chat and throughout the rest of the game tonight, so if you have the opportunity to help out, I highly recommend it. Come help these people that have lost a lot in the past couple weeks or so. Give what you can. I've given, and we really appreciate that support.
Travis: They'll let you delineate between Harvey and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J. Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma, the damage is still accruing.
Matt: I grew up in Florida. I know the area well, and I have family out there that endured it. It's very close to me. So if you can, greatly appreciate it. Let's see here. Merch! Laura.
Laura: This feels so weird to say after you mentioned that.
Travis: Nah, but we make happy stuff.
Laura: Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully.
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: I'll show it to you, and my back brace, to make it really better.
Sam: Are we selling those in the store?
Matt: The back brace?
Travis: Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you!
Liam: We missed an opportunity to put Backblaze on that back brace. (groaning)
Laura: Next time.
Matt: Next time.
Liam: No next time!
Laura: There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled.
Matt: Thank you, Laura. Also reminding you guys, we have up to episode 40 of Critical Role now released on iTunes, Google, and geekandsundry.com has all the information for it. So if you want to listen to the podcast, or your friends have been like, "I don't want to watch it, but I just want to hear it."
Laura: I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it.
Matt: It's good for commutes.
Marisha: Also, clarification, speaking of saying things prematurely before I should have. I've gotten a lot of questions being like, "What happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said it, and then I looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But do not announce this part." Which, why was it even on our announcement sheet? Still my fault.
Matt: To be fair, I remember looking down at the sheet as you were announcing it.
Marisha: Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch. So ten at a time. That's what you get.
Taliesin: It's like one cookie at a time. You can't bake one cookie at a time.
Marisha: It's just better to do them in a block.
Matt: Thank you for the heads-up on that. We announced a while back the Critical Role six-issue mini-series comic book. We announced last week that it's going through Dark Horse, which I'm super excited about.
Travis: DM is very excited.
Matt: Oh, yeah. Dark Horse was my introduction. I was probably in fourth grade when I got into the Alien comics through Dark Horse. I didn't realize there was more to explore. Dude, I've been a fan of them ever since. Being able to take this into their realm is brilliant. I'm so excited. First issue drops on the 20th, guys.
Marisha: The digital issue. The first issue releases digitally this coming Wednesday.
Sam: Is it good? I haven't read it.
Laura: It's so good!
Sam: Why have you all read it and I haven't?
Marisha: Because you don't read your emails.
Sam: Yeah, that's fair.
Liam: You show up ten minutes after we start, you leave an hour before we end the game every week.
Sam: That's true.
Matt: So that's coming up. It will be on Comixology, iBooks, Dark Horse Digital, Kindle, Nook, Google Play, etc. It's written by our good friend, Matt Colville. It's drawn beautifully by our good friend, Olivia Samson from the Critter community, and the coloring and lettering by Chris Northrop. Super stoked, hope you guys enjoy it. So look out for that next week.
Liam: Looks fucking awesome! The writing is awesome! The art is awesome!
Matt: What he said.
Laura: Did you already say about the physical copies, too? When those will be released?
Matt: We'll have a trade available in spring 2018.
Liam: It's coming out with the DLC for Middle Earth.
Matt: Yeah, to tie in with it. Of course, we have Talks Machina coming up this Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here with our fantastic host, Brian. We'll be talking about our episode tonight. So look for that next week. All the Critical Role episodes are now available on Alpha. They've gone back and added the bells and whistles, the information, the stats, everything, for all the episodes before Alpha even launched. So if you ever watched it there, it's all updated.
Sam: I really should check my email!
Taliesin: We would miss this sense of wonder that we get to share with the community. It's really nice.
Marisha: They get your unbridled reaction.
Taliesin: It's like watching Home Alone next to Macaulay Culkin. It's great. I'm getting so much out of it.
Matt: All righty. Last few things. One  this is Sub-tember, guys, by the way, for Twitch. Sub-tember means for the next few weeks, Twitch has a special promotion where subscriptions are half off for new subs for every Twitch channel, including this one. So if you've been watching and you've always wanted to subscribe, but you never really felt like you can give the full $5, it's half off this month. So if you want to subscribe to our Twitch, now's the month to do it. Just giving the heads-up. It's pretty rad, and thank you, Sub-tember. Last but not least, Laura and Travis, you are going to be at an event soon, aren't you?
Travis: Yeah! End of this month, we're going to be at Anime Weekend Atlanta. The last week of September. Hotlanta, Georgia. We're going to be there with other people like Jennifer Hale and people like that. But we're going to be there. Come out, say hi, smack our hands, not our faces.
Laura: Give a high-five.
Marisha: I love Atlanta.
Travis: It's pretty dope. I want to get in that aquarium with those whale sharks. That's what I want to do. We're not going to have time for that. And then, also, in the middle of November, we're going to be going to Australia. Laura and I are going for two weeks. We're going to be in Adelaide, Brisbane. So for all the Aussies-- what?
Laura: I've got to get my passport.
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: Expedite!
Travis: So barring Laura's passport showing up--
Matt: You can hear the $400 burn away instantly. That's how much it costs to expedite.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm doing that tomorrow! I'm going to write a note in my calendar.
Travis: (sighs) Adelaide, Brisbane. If you're there, you want to see us, come see maybe just me. (laughter)
Sam: Everybody tweet Laura tomorrow at noon, saying--
Laura: No, but seriously! If you want to, feel free.
Travis: Will Friedle will be there, too. He's going to be my convention wife. Me and Friedle.
Laura: I'm writing an email to myself.
Marisha: Australia? Is that when we got caught with having to have those weird travel visas, as well?
Matt: Yeah. Make sure you get your travel visas.
Marisha: Yeah, we didn't know until we got to the airport. And then they're like, "You have to have one." And then we're like, "Oh, okay." Luckily, you can do it online.
Travis: Oh, I totally have that covered.
Matt: All right. Well, cool, guys! Thank you so much. Thank you for dealing with our long announcements. It's been a few weeks. However, I think, with that, it's time to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. I'll remember this. Why's everything targeting Scanlan in this battle? Welcome back, everyone. So last we left off, Vox Machina, preparing themselves for a final fray with the recently ascended god, Vecna, the Undying King, discovered that he had brought the city of Thar Amphala about 300 miles northwest, of Vasselheim on the continent of Issylra. Upon gathering allies to assail this region, you discovered that it was shifting, moving. And apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial earth titan had been risen and began marching its way towards Vasselheim with Thar Amphala embedded at the top of its torso, protected by some sort of magical barrier. With an advance army of wyvern riders at your back and J'mon Sa Ord giving you a ride between their wings, you made your way southward. Quickly depositing yourselves within a waterfall, expelling opening towards the hip of this large titan undead beast, you began to fight your way to the interior. Dealing with corrupted earth elemental shards, you began to make your way through the catacombs, the long ruined and abandoned dwarven city of Thomara, where you encountered the tomb of the dwarven king. Where you also managed to raid the tomb, found a magical item, and dealt with some fun traps in the process. Then, continuing to follow where this route led you upward, hopefully towards the underbelly of the city of Thar Amphala, you uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did battle with some undead trolls that immediately rushed in and attacked you. You managed to destroy them, and make your way out through a small cavern that had just momentarily collapsed, clearing out of the way. You all began to squeeze through the opening to find the next length of your journey. And that's where we left off. As you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening, you come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each impact of the feet of the titan you're currently riding within. It seems to be going at a steady incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to 45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet.
Sam: How do you play Dungeons and Dragons?
Matt: Two weeks, Sam? It's too much for you?
Sam: I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed to do now. Insight check! I got nothing.
Liam: I'm going to do my due diligence and scoot a little ahead of everybody and start looking for traps or anything hinky.
Travis: Wait, Vax. You should consult that little scrawny NPC fellow that was supposed-- oh, wait. Oh, he's dead.
Liam: Did anybody see that guy?
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Yeah, we did. We saw him.
Matt: Well, you saw the corpse after it was there, yeah.
Liam: Nobody asked me about him.
Laura: No, because you did a good job of killing that.
Liam: That clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating flesh, as I saw it, so problem solved. We're on a time table, yeah?
Laura: We should keep moving upwards, I'm assuming?
Sam: Did we get any items recently?
Travis: No, I picked up that hammer that was hitting me in the face.
Laura: Well, yeah. But Percy, the belt?
Sam: Yeah, what does it do?
Taliesin: Stuff, things. I'm using it right now.
Marisha: Do we need to do a switchery-poo of our items?
Laura: I think we maybe should do that, actually.
Sam: We all have potions, right? Did we pass out potions?
Travis: We all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon.
Liam: Are we going to take a little 20-minute breather here?
Sam: This is just for us to remember what we're doing. I don't know. Should we stop? I think we're on a timetable. We should keep moving, right? Does anyone need to heal?
Marisha: We just stopped, right?
Matt: You'd taken a brief rest after the battle with the trolls where you guys began to look about the inside of the vault. And that's where the part of the exit collapsed.
Travis: I didn't roll any hit dice. Should we roll some hit dice?
Marisha: You dug things out?
Laura: But he was doing something? He was reading, or something.
Sam: Yeah, you were trying to read Dwarvish, or something. And it took an hour.
Travis: I clearly do not remember this. That's right, I remember. I don't remember what I read, but I remember.
Sam: It just said, "Do not enter."
Travis: Yep. There were things.
Liam: We're doing the Vox Machina thing and standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to attune the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic damage.
Matt: All righty. Necrotic it is.
Travis: We also need to be on the lookout for that sword, remember? In the story?
Sam: The sword of Kas?
Travis: Just saying. Keep your eyes peeled, high-perception people.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I literally can't see anything.
Laura: Wait, we have light.
Marisha: (whoosh)
Laura: Yeah, see?
Matt: Between her hand, his dagger, and Pike's mace, you have a few light sources that you guys maintain.
Laura: Pike's mace is lit up. We said that last time.
Matt: But do keep in mind that light sources also do make you a bright beacon in dark places.
Laura: Probably your hands are less noticeable than Pike's mace.
Liam: Oh, I don't know.
Taliesin: I think they would be less intimidated by a glowing mace than by glowing hands, at this point.
Matt: Glowing hands is like a small torch firelight. The Mace of Disruption--
Liam: Is like a headlamp.
Laura: So maybe we'll not have the mace on.
Liam: "Yeah, okay. I'll put this away."
Laura: That sounded just like her.
Sam: She's turning more and more Canadian as you go.
Liam: She's kind of Canadian already. Come on.
Matt: So if I could have a marching order, please?
Liam: Yo. Up front, looking for traps.
Laura: Did you want this acid-resistant armor? You'd at least be resistant to acid.
Travis: And Vex is probably with her brother. I'll be right behind the twins. It's the twins and then me. Who wants to be behind?
Taliesin: I'll be behind you.
Matt: Okay. Do you have Trinket out, Vex?
Laura: Yeah, Trinket is out.
Matt: Percy's after Grog.
Marisha: Me.
Matt: Keyleth, and then we have Pike and Scanlan holding up the rear. All righty, there you go. Have that marked down. How far ahead are you tracking?
Liam: 20 feet.
Matt: So 20 feet ahead, you begin to make your way up the incline, and it is loose rock in this tunnel. As you step, there are elements that skid and fall beneath the pressure of your feet, and you have to be careful as you progress up the incline based on how much it continues upward to keep your footing.
Laura: Brother.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me.
Liam: I turn around and look at her and go  all right.
Laura: You said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me, I'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you.
Liam: You're stage-whispering and that's very easy to hear.
Laura: Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all right?
Liam: I love you. Perception check. Investigation for traps? Yeah. That is a 25.
Matt: Okay. No traps catch your attention. As you progress forward, you begin to notice the tunnel seems to be pincering a bit the further you go. The sides of the walls begin to close in and eventually, about 30 feet ahead, comes from the 15, 20-foot width that the initial entrance way into this carved tunnel was, pinches to about three feet wide.
Sam: How tall?
Matt: About five and half, six feet tall?
Taliesin: Is this pressure by design, or is this what's been done to the structure by the transformation?
Matt: You'll probably have to get closer to see. Where you are currently, it looks like part of the tunnel was carved outward and then shaken, and elements of it collapsed and loosened the earth that at one point was packed at the sides.
Laura: And the tunnel's rising steadily upwards?
Matt: Yeah. It's coming at an incline.
Travis: How's it look?
Liam: It's dark up there. I can only see about 60 feet up. Does it keep going beyond that?
Matt: The incline isn't increasing. It gets to about a 45-degree incline and then maintains that up until the outside of your visual range.
Liam: Okay. I'm a punching bag for this shit. Why don't you all wait here a minute. Wait.
All: Wait.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up there?
Liam: Well, will you go with me?
Laura: Of course. Can you not use your wings?
Liam: They're gone.
Laura: Well, then hop on.
Liam: This could be the last time we do this. Come on.
Sam: Oh god.
Liam: Well, there's only four games left, Sam.
Laura: You don't know that!
Liam: It's scripted! (laughter)
Marisha: That's going to be a Reddit thread later.
Laura: Do we have Pass Without a Trace on?
Liam: Yeah, I think that probably faded by now.
Matt: Not if you haven't recast it because after the short rest it would've been gone.
Laura: Should I cast that on us?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: No, wait! I shouldn't because I got a proficiency, so we're both stealthy stealth. We're fine. So we're just going to go. I'm not casting it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them.
Liam: Right. We'll go 60 feet up, see what we can see.
Laura: And then come back down.
Liam: Sure. Or you could stay there and I could go even further up 60 feet--
Laura: All right. As long as everybody's within 60 feet of me. Because we're getting really close and I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring.
Taliesin: That's right. I forgot about the ring.
Liam: All right. Let's do that.
Matt: So as you guys glide up on the broom, stealthily, I want you guys both to roll a stealth check, please.
Travis: Pick from your fucking 300 dice.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Travis: Almost poked my eye out. You almost made me Vecna.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 29.
Laura: 30.
Matt: All right. That's impressive. So as you both quietly coast your way past this entrance way, squeezing into this two and a half, three-foot-wide location, you get just within the 60 foot range and look up and Vax, you step off the broom and make your way quietly up to the other side of the range. You get about 30 feet beyond the broom before your vision meets where this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there is a solid, rocky blockage.
Laura: What do you see?
Liam: It's corked up. It's all right. Yeah, it's blocked up with stone. I guess I'd have to get a closer look to see if we could get through.
Laura: Well, get a fucking closer look.
Taliesin: If we have to, we can just have Grog beat it down.
Laura: Yes, but quiet is the key word.
Taliesin: Is it? We can try and time it to a step.
Liam: Hand on the sides to get my way up closer to it. Looking for any traps.
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check as you're climbing up to maintain the strength, as the incline is now towards the end getting more and more steep.
Liam: Get ready to catch me.
Laura: I'm going to hover.
Liam: Yes! My athletics is a two, but I rolled a 19, so 21.
Matt: Deftly, you manage to find the proper handholds and pull your strength up as the final bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight carrying situation, and you come to the edge of the rock and you see it. It does appear to be a rocky cave-in or larger boulder that has fallen or been placed to close. It looks to be one solid rock, yeah. At this point, the entrance is about four foot by two foot. And it's all blocked by one solid piece of rock.
Liam: Yeah. We're not getting through this. Hey. I'm not getting through this, you're not. Maybe Kiki can.
Laura: Do we see any other openings?
Matt: This would be a perception check.
Sam: Matt, my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way.
Marisha: That's what we're doing. While they do that, we're timing the steps out.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 20.
Matt: 20? Okay.
Taliesin: Ugh.
Marisha: Ugh.
Sam: 15.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: It's not that difficult to discern the pattern of the steps. The entirety of this titan shifts and quakes with each footfall, so it's pretty easy to find the pattern. It rarely changes, and you imagine any slight shift that you feel as they're going about this is because it's stepping on or through terrain that is not flat. But it is a pretty discernible pattern.
Taliesin: We could go have Grog smash it down in tempo with the steps so that the sound will be covered.
Travis: Like Shawshank Redemption and the poop pipe.
Taliesin: I was thinking of the Tainted Love Levi's commercial.
Laura: Do I see any other--
Matt: Not really. It mostly looks like loose rock and the more you glance about with each impacting footfall, you see two or three errant rocks go. You guys watch as more rocks tumble down the incline.
Laura: Maybe we need to do this quickly. This doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel. Hop on the broom, darling.
Taliesin: I like the idea of you punching this at the appropriate moment.
Marisha: It also saves me a 6th-level spell.
Travis: Well, that's what's most important. Are the Knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: And I would like to try and bash the shit out of this--
Taliesin: In tempo.
Laura: In tempo.
Matt: This is a tight tunnel for you. You have to crouch down, round your shoulders as you're doing it.
Travis: I'm going to do the one-inch punch.
Matt: Make an athletics check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Yeah, because I'm an angry monster. 21.
Matt: Okay. Here's the scenario  Vex and Vax, as you guys are on the broom in the tunnel, you look down and you know in Labyrinth, when the cleaner comes through the tunnel that fills the entirety of the space? You watch as this angry goliath starts up the tunnel towards you, and there does not appear to be much of any space you could squeeze through.
Liam: Is there a bubble at the top, maybe?
Laura: Grog?
Travis: What? (angry panting)
Laura: Can we pass under his legs or something?
Liam: Dive, dive!
Laura: Rage quietly.
Matt: You can both attempt to. Make an acrobatics check to attempt to squeeze between his legs.
Laura: At the same time? Acrobatics. 22.
Liam: 30-something.
Matt: It's not comfortable, but you both (popping) out the back, between his monstrous goliath thighs. From a backward perspective, those of you who are still waiting a little further down the tunnel from Vex: it's a unique sight, as the back end of your goliath friend suddenly gives birth to two half-elves. It's very Ace Ventura 2. However, you eventually climb your way angrily up to the very edge and there is the boulder, there, and you're about to go right towards it, but then stop and remember what your friends had said, and you wait patiently for the pattern of the next footfall. (boom)
Travis: (punch impact)
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Travis: Can I make it reckless-- oh, I didn't say it.
Laura: But you do extra damage because you're--
Travis: Oh, yeah, siege. Oh, it's fine. 30.
Matt: Yeah, all right, so roll 1d4 damage.
Travis: Okay, 1d4. Four!
Matt: Plus your strength modifier and your rage damage.
Travis: Eight. 27.
Matt: Whoa, wait, did you double it already?
Travis: No.
Matt: Wait, so it's four plus eight, 12.
Travis: And my rage damage is 15. Well, that's with the axe.
Matt: That's with the axe, yeah. No, that's your overall. So your rage damage at this level is four, because you just went up a level. So it's 12 plus four, so it's 16. So you do 32 points of bludgeoning damage with a single punch to this rock. With one hit, the entire boulder shifts and cracks, and you watch as part of it breaks away, and you see a brief glimmer of a dull light from the opposite side, as it rests back into place, heavily damaged.
Taliesin: (singing) Wait for it to go again and bump, bump, bump.
Matt: You wait for the next footfall of the titan (impact). You feel the impact and the shake. Do you want to go for another punch?
Travis: Do I hit it now?
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: Yes!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: Roll another attack.
Travis: Oh, that's even better. 33.
Matt: Easily enough. Go ahead and roll another d4.
Travis: Two plus eight. Ten plus--
Matt: Four for rage damage.
Travis: 14.
Matt: All right, and so with that, your fist slams into the boulder a second time. It explodes and shatters into hundreds of crumbled pieces of rock and stone goes firing across the distance of this tunnel, now revealing a little bit of flickering firelight. As you're sitting there seething with anger and your muscles and veins bulging with each breath--
Travis: I'm so swole right now.
Matt: Yeah. You can see above you, this entranceway opens up into a five-foot wide, ten-foot tall hallway that goes to the right and left. As you emerge, it goes a little bit to the right and front, and then to the back and behind you that direction.
Travis: Hey guys, it's a Z.
Laura: What do you see?
Travis: Let me find out. So I wiggle up a little more.
Marisha: So you know the first and last letter of the alphabet? Don't worry about it.
Matt: So you squeeze out of the small entrance way and step up into it. You can see now a well-constructed hallway. You can see there are stone slabs that are carved. The patterns and the angular architecture of this hall as it comes up into a trapezoid position. The hall comes in a bit, and the hallway rooftop is a flat, even surface. This is apparently a hall of dwarven make and seems to be a continuation of some sort of structure or pathway of Thomara.
Taliesin: Let the twins take a look. I think it would be safe.
Travis: It's a well-constructed hallway of dwarvish make. (groans)
Laura: We sneak under his legs again to like see what's going on.
Matt: You guys all eventually make your way up into this hallway. Now, it is still a five -foot-wide hallway, so you're still here in single-file progression one way or the other.
Liam: Twins are already at the top looking for problems.
Matt: Right, so you guys would be able to because it's a ten-foot-tall tunnel. You guys would be able to occupy a space above another party member if you were both on the broom.
Laura: Oh, should we be on the broom? No, you should be off the broom because you might check for traps. I'll check for traps along the wall and ceiling. And he's going to check for traps--
Liam: I'll take the lower half. That's called advantage.
Matt: So go ahead and make and investigation check.
Laura: Both of us or just him with advantage?
Matt: Both of you separately because you're investigating different elements of the hallway.
Liam: 18 for me.
Laura: Investigation? Natural fucking 20!
Matt: As you guys glance up and focus on the surrounding location. The hallway behind you goes for about 30 or so feet before it looks like a cave in. It looks like a mass of fully collapsed, broken stone. You can see bits of the hallway slabs that originally held up that part are collapsed inward and broken, left scattered across the ground. The other direction you go continues on and opens into a dark chamber about 60 feet ahead of you.
Laura: We should go toward the cave in, don't you think?
Matt: There are small built-in sconces that are magically, perpetually burning firelight.
Laura: Does this seem like there's any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the--?
Matt: You do not notice anything, as you were investigating specifically for that.
Taliesin: Check the sconces, see if they trigger something.
Laura: I'll look at the sconces.
Liam: I will look at the sconces.
Laura: I'll look at them better.
Matt: I included that as your perception for traps above. You did not notice anything that would be considered a trap.
Laura: You guys, there's no traps. We should head towards this darkened room.
Marisha: Save a life, check a sconce.
Liam: I'm going to creep about 40 feet down the hall and continue that search.
Matt: About 20 feet before this darkened chamber is there before you. As you get to the edge, you can see a little bit the very inside of this chamber. You can see a darkened brazier. It's your mind playing tricks on you. You thought you heard a raven.
Liam: Every day when I'm on the crapper, Matt. Everywhere.
Matt: A cold metallic brazier in the middle of the room. And that's as far as you can see into the chamber, before the edge of your visual range goes dark.
Taliesin: People don't install those unless there's something awful that needs to be done.
Marisha: Do we have any idea how far we've climbed?
Matt: You can make a nature check.
Liam: And do I need to make a extra roll to look for traps around this brazier?
Matt: If you want to enter the chamber, you can. You're too far away.
Marisha: Hey! Natural 20! That's a Gil 20!
Matt: As you take a moment, and think back to how far you've traveled path-wise and inclines and where you entered this titan and to where the city of Thar Amphala is placed upon its torso, you gather you're close to halfway through its torso, if not a little beyond it.
Marisha: If not a little beyond?
Sam: He's big.
Marisha: Okay, all right. Nipple level?
Matt: Sternum.
Marisha: The heartburn region? A little acid reflux?
Liam: We are the acid reflux.
Marisha: He has acid resistance against reflux.
Liam: Jesus Christ. Whoever that is.
Matt: You scoot up to the edge.
Liam: I don't want to go further than roughly 60 feet away from my sister.
Matt: Right. Which will put you right at the entryway to this chamber.
Liam: Yeah. So I will peep in from here.
Laura: I follow up and stand next to him. Did you want to go in?
Liam: I did.
Laura: Feel free.
Matt: So the marching order is the same? We got the twins up the front.
Taliesin: Yeah. I like this marching order.
Liam: Let this shit blow up in my face, so everybody hang back for a second. And I'm going to pitter patter in and look around the sconce, the room.
Laura: I think I was more stealthy than you a moment ago, so are you sure you want to be in front of me?
Liam: I love you anyway. Here I go.
Taliesin: He's better at blowing up than you are, dear.
Travis: Yeah. His heart beats once a century, so let him go.
Liam: Slower than this titan's footfalls.
Matt: All right. So as you enter the chamber, it's a small, about 20-foot radius square-shaped dark iron chamber with rounded corners. So it's about 40 feet wide from side to side, 20 feet from the center where the brazier is and the corners are slightly curved. It doesn't come to a straight, hard corner. There is no exit door currently visible; the chamber comes to an end. The room looks mostly bare, aside from an eight-foot-tall, five-foot-wide mirror coated in dust, framed in intricate gold and brass that sits across the chamber on the opposite side of where you entered.
Liam: Mirror in brass. So it's an iron room, right?
Matt: Iron room with a brass edge around this eight-foot tall, five-foot wide mirror. You can tell it's a mirror from this side. What little bit of light there is behind you, you can see your silhouette waving mirrored in the mirror.
Liam: So doorway, brazier, mirror.
Matt: Mirror. And then the rest of the chamber seems fairly empty.
Laura: And the brazier is complete dark?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: It's cold.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Laura: This is not good.
Liam: Look at his fake innocent face.
Sam: I think it's just a vanity.
Liam: Going to check for traps from right here to start. All right. That's totally fine. That's a jellyfish. That is a 17.
Matt: You begin to glance around the chamber, best you can, to take in the scenery. You notice small gold piece-sized buttons or pressure knobs set in the rounded corners of the chamber on the mirror side. One's embedded within the upper left and right corners and within the lower left and right corners.
Sam: Pressure knobs?
Matt: They're like little buttons that are gold piece-sized that are embedded in the upper right and left corners and the lower left and right corners.
Travis: Push them!
Liam: Stubby, come up here. I have a real bad history with pushing buttons.
Matt: You also notice very thin light piles of black residue or ash scattered in places across the floor.
Marisha: Called it. This is a fucking incinerator. I knew it! This feels like an incinerator. No? What? He's looking at me-- (nervous laughter)
Liam: (sighs) So we've got buttons.
Marisha: Or lasers.
Travis: Incinerator or lasers.
Marisha: Laser incinerator! Duh!
Travis: That was a great jump for me and my character.
Liam: If something stupid is going to happen here, I don't want it to be on me alone for once. So we've got an unlit brazier, there's mirror over there, and buttons, yeah.
Laura: Maybe the mirror is a door.
Liam: I thought that, as well.
Laura: Should we try to walk through it?
Taliesin: Maybe a second interrogation room and there's another room behind it, maybe?
Liam: Can we get your hub up here, please?
Taliesin: I am up here. I'm right here.
Liam: Jesus!
Laura: Hi, darling. I don't know why he didn't hear you. You used to be so good at that. Is the mirror leaning or is it on the wall?
Matt: It's on the wall.
Marisha: Is it curved? No. The whole room isn't curved. It's a square room.
Matt: It's a square room but the corners curve ever so slightly so there's no direct corner and in those curved corners on the side that the mirror's on, so the far side from you, there's these little buttons in the upper right and left corner and the lower left and right.
Laura: Can I reach down and touch the iron on the ground? The floor? Does it feel warm?
Matt: Mm. It's cold.
Liam: I catch her wrist. Just a second. You two do the thinking, all right? And I take a step into the room.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What do I do?
Laura: Go see if you can walk through the mirror.
Taliesin: Tap the mirror.
Travis: Light the brazier!
Laura: We've done that before and we all exploded.
Travis: Yeah, but it's Vax.
Marisha: Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some of the ashy stuff?
Matt: If you enter the chamber to, yeah.
Marisha: Hand me some ash. I'll test it.
Liam: I scoop some ash. Lady of the Grey Hunt, here. I scoop up some ash and I pour it into her hands.
Marisha: Okay. I do a nature check. What does this ash feel like it's made out of?
Sam: Human bones.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans)
Taliesin: Wow.
Laura: No. What is it? (groans)
Travis: Is it for real? You are lying!
Liam: Look at that face! You are not lying!
Marisha: Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil. I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe.
Matt: It's light ash. You're not sure what the basis of what may have burned here. You see more of it gathered near where the brazier is.
Taliesin: Is it in piles that would be about human-amount of ash?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: All right. I'll Gil this one. Yeah, natural 20. That'll do.
Sam: Only ones and 20s tonight.
Liam: That's it, yeah. Just quarters. Heads up, heads down.
Matt: More of it seems to be around the base of the brazier, but you do see there are thicker traces at different places throughout the chamber.
Taliesin: It's organic ash?
Matt: You've dealt with different types of ash. The carbon appears to have been organic-based at some point.
Liam: I pull off my belt and say  Hello, Simon. Wake him up.
Matt: Okay. (slithering)
Liam: Hi. Gosh, it's been a while.
Laura: Simon, go through the mirror.
Liam: That's right. Go check out the mirror, Simon, all right? Off you go.
Travis: Are we still in the room?
Laura: No, nobody's in the room. He's the only one in the room.
Matt: (slithering) Scoots over and heads up to the mirror and presses up against it.
Liam: I dart back one step out of the room as it happens.
Matt: The snake trying to push up against the wall but half of its body sliding against the mirror before it eventually scoots off and lands. It tries again, pushing against the mirror and then eventually (sliding).
Taliesin: I hate to say this, but tap the button?
Liam: That's on the list. Simon, buddy. Crawl up the brazier. Wrap around it. Go up to the top.
Matt: The snake slithers around and makes its way. It's a cross-metal cage. There are inch wide metal bars that all curl up like a basket and then there are bars that cross around it to hold the shape. It looks like there are some long-burned, blackened pieces of wood that have been left for a long time. So Simon curls up into the brazier and curls up around the metal, comes around the top of the outer rim of it, rests there.
Liam: There's two buttons low down. Oh man. The nostalgia here. All right, buddy. I take two steps back away from the door. Buddy buds. Will you go push those low buttons in the room?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: There's two, right?
Matt: There's four on the opposite side.
Liam: There's two high up. And I don't think he can reach the high, because he doesn't stick to walls. Get the one over here on the left first.
Laura: What if we all have to push every button at the same time?
Liam: That's true. That could be.
Matt: Simon (slithering) moves over.
Liam: I lean over to Percy, I say  science!
Matt: Hits the button. (click) Right on the entrance of where you are in the chamber, slams closed. Iron metal now closes off that entranceway.
Taliesin: I'm going to touch the door.
Sam: And say goodbye.
Taliesin: Simon, we barely knew him. Is it warm?
Matt: It is beginning to get warm.
Taliesin: It's an oven. I'm looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on the outside of the door.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: Is Vax in the room?
Liam: No, I took two steps back from the door.
Laura: No, nobody's in the room.
Taliesin: Let's say that investigation was somewhere around a seven? (laughter)
Matt: It's pretty solid at this point. The walls that lean in towards the ceiling there-- it is a perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the entrance.
Travis: No problem. I'll get it down.
Laura: No!
Liam: Wait. Simon is technically a magical item, so I don't think he would be harmed by anything going on in there, so why don't we give it five minutes?
Marisha: And maybe it'll open again.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Is there anything going on in the tunnel, on the outside of this door, where we are?
Laura: Coming up from behind us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Temperature check, anything like that? Natural 20.
Taliesin: We have been gone so long!
Matt: Gone for two weeks and you guys can't find middle math. It's only extremes.
Liam: Yeah, we've had blue balls for two weeks, and it's all coming out now.
Matt: So as you guys glance back in the shadow of the tunnel behind you, nothing seems to be catching your eye. It's still dark. About two minutes in, what was once dark metal is now giving a slight orangish hue. You can feel the heat emanating from it.
Travis: There's no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right now, right?
Matt: I'd say, because of your perception check, as you glance around, there does not appear to be any ash.
Travis: I don't want that door to fucking open all of a sudden.
Matt: About five minutes go by as you guys are waiting. Eventually, the iron wall begins to descend. The dull orangish glow of it is still there. As it opens, a wave of heated air emerges from the chamber. You all have to immediately close your eyes. Some of you instinctually begin to step further back into the hallway. On the inside of the room, you can see the black iron interior of the chamber is also that same orangish glow. The mirror is unscathed. You all step back and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly begins to cool off, the metal slowly darkening. You're too far away to look. You make a perception check to try and glance in?
Laura: Can't you call to him?
Liam: Simon? Come here, buddy.
Matt: There's no response.
Liam: (gasps) He's a magical item! Oh, but he could have turned back into a belt.
Taliesin: What's he going to say if you call to him? Was he going to say something?
Liam: He would come to me, Percy! Jeepers creepers! Perception check? 29!
Matt: You glance past where the button was that it hit. You see a limp belt left on the ground.
Liam: Okay, I'll get that in a minute.
Laura: When you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist.
Matt: Technically, since Simon's taken enough damage to revert to the belt form, Simon cannot turn back into a snake for the day.
Laura: How about that unseen servant?
Liam: I'm thinking, having no knowledge of magic, that we either want to somehow push all four of these buttons at once, as my sister said, or light this brazier, or both.
Laura: What about the brazier? Is it cold? Does it look like it's hot?
Sam: The brazier's the source of the furnace, I assume.
Travis: Are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it?
Matt: The pieces are still there, but it's black carbon. There's nothing in there that could burn. Whatever's been in there has been heated so much to the point--
Travis: It's not the source of the flame. Not for that much heat.
Marisha: If I was the person who designed this, why would I put a failsafe in here?
Liam: A way to get through that only the creator would know how to use?
Marisha: I feel like there's got to be another entrance because we can see another room, right?
Laura: There's no other room, it's a mirror. Oh, Keyleth, that's our reflection.
Marisha: No, I know that, but a lot of things have reflections.
Liam: Listen, all of you, or I, are going to be dead very soon. Are you sure you want to be that sarcastic right now?
Marisha: I go up to the mirror and check it out. It's cooled off enough, right?
Matt: Well, no. If you guys want to take a few minutes, you can wait until it cools off, if you want to.
Taliesin: Why don't we try pushing all four buttons at once?
Sam: Wait, before we do that, I'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling.
Matt: Okay, I take it you wait until it cools off. It takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully cool off, to the point where it's comfortable.
Sam: I'm looking for markings, indications of instructions, arrows, any hidden words--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Look for Dwarvish. I'm aces with that.
Sam: Ooh, a lot. 29.
Taliesin: He's coming up with some bullshit.
Matt: Okay. Because the room is not fully cooled off, it's still warm in there, somewhat. You glance through. The ceiling and the walls all appear to be solid iron, and there's a layer of dust across a lot of it, a bit of ash from whatever previously may have been incinerated in here, long ago. As you look from the opposite side of the room into the reflection of the mirror, you see a very faint orangish glow in the reflection. It looks like, in the upper corner and the lower corner of the opposite side of the mirror as you're glancing off across to the other side. As you look over to the wall, of the room you're in, there's no glow.
Sam: Wait, so the wall that we came in through?
Matt: Let's say you enter the chamber and you move to the corner immediately to your right. You look in the mirror at an angle. You're now seeing the reflection of the corner opposite to you, right? Looking in that reflection, you can see this very faint orange glow in the upper and lower corner, but you glance over to the physical corner across from you, and it's not there.
Laura: What do your gnomish eyes see, Scanlan?
Sam: I think there's magical buttons in here and we need to find them? So I'm going to look in the mirror. I go to the opposite corner and do the same thing.
Matt: As you have this conversation and look back, those two glowing sigils are gone.
Sam: Even in the mirror?
Matt: Even in the mirror. What you saw earlier is now gone.
Travis: But they're revealed by heat.
Marisha: Where were they?
Sam: They were upper and lower corner, yeah.
Marisha: I walk over and I heat them with my heat hands.
Matt: Okay, so you take your hands and you put them up near there. As you put your hands on the wall, nothing seems to happen. As you glance through the reflection where she has her hands, that symbol seems to be appearing again.
Laura: What is the symbol of?
Sam: It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it?
Matt: It looks to be a simple triangular symbol, marked in a circle. Make an arcana check.
Sam: Oh yeah. 14 plus six, that's 20.
Matt: It's the most basic of arcane marks. It's a variation on a spell that basically is a mark that a certain enchanter or somebody places to mark as their own. However, this is meant to be a basic marker, a visual draw. There's no language behind it. It's just an indicator.
Sam: Keyleth, do that same thing to the lower one. Same marking?
Matt: As you head down there, the one above begins to slowly fade. As her hands go there, the symbol appears below.
Sam: Same symbol? Let's do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones.
Matt: As you guys reverse, opposite sides, you go to the other corners, the ones that were immediately toward the entrance of where you walked in. Sure enough, two more symbols, mirroring where the buttons are on the far side corners.
Sam: So we push those? But there's a hidden button in there.
Travis: When you're a big fire, the walking thing--
Marisha: A fire elemental.
Travis: Sure. Do you take damage from fire? So you should be in here.
Laura: You should go in there, see if you can disengage the trap.
Liam: So you are impervious to being set on fire or burned?
Marisha: Well, when I'm a fire elemental.
Laura: Can you do that?
Marisha: Can I do it right now? Yeah. I just took a short rest, so yes, I can do that.
Travis: We also have an unseen servant.
Sam: So we're going to need four people.
Marisha: So what's the end goal? What am I doing?
Liam: Press all four buttons at once, although we've got at least three sharpshooters--
Sam: Not the buttons that we can see. What are these symbols here? I think they're buttons, as well.
Travis: It might be a depression on the wall or something.
Marisha: But what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols?
Taliesin: Let's try pushing all four buttons.
Travis: The regular buttons or the magic ones?
Liam: Please stand by.
Laura: I want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button.
Marisha: Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's nothing there, right?
Sam: Was there anything there?
Matt: You put your hand on there. Nothing. The wall doesn't move.
Marisha: It's just a wall.
Travis: No depression, no toggle?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: I've got this, you guys. Oh! Minus two. 17!
Matt: 17. Grog, as you step up and glare down at the place where Keyleth had placed her palm, you get frustrated and (sighs heavily). As you exhale, it looks like a bit of soot and ash that had been slowly drifting in and filling this space flutters away. You can see two lines, parallel to each other, about an inch tall.
Travis: Fifth Element, anyone? Oh look! Breath of Grog reveals all! Look, behold! Two. Lines.
Laura: What did you do?
Travis: I breathed on the wall.
Sam: What do they do? What do these lines do?
Marisha: I do a quick Gust cantrip.
Matt: Across the parallel lines? All right. As the wind blows across it, a lot more of the soot and the ash blows around the area. It creates an open space where it pushes out to the edges and darkens areas of the floor and the vicinity around Keyleth. That edge of that corner, where you blew the Gust cantrip that Grog had unfurled, is now clear, the iron revealed. Nothing beyond the two.
Laura: I fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go (blowing).
Matt: Okay. So up there. You blow on that one and it looks like--
Marisha: Hang on, I've got a paper ready.
Liam: How many people at home do you think have figured this out already?
Laura: We already figured it out!
Sam: Wait, you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols?
Laura: Yeah, to clear them out!
Travis: If you're looking at the door we came in, Grog blew on the lower right?
Sam: And that's two lines. Boom.
Matt: That would be lower right.
Travis: Two vertical lines.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: I'm in the corner above Grog.
Matt: That would be upper right.
Taliesin: I'm going to do bottom left.
Matt: All right, you blow, and you watch as the dust reveals. It's two more lines.
Laura: Two lines? Shit. I thought it was going to be another--
Taliesin: Bottom left. Getting out a hanky and (blows).
Liam: Did you use your ascot?
Taliesin: Yes, of course. That's what it's there for. The back of it.
Laura: The one clean spot left on it.
Matt: That one has four parallel lines.
Laura: Ooh! I'll go into the corner above Percy. There was a reflection there, too, right?
Sam: Blow! Laura, blow!
Laura: (blows) I looked straight at the camera as I did it. It was really awkward.
Matt: All right, that one has a single line.
Sam: Wait, so we've got one, two, two, four?
Laura: Is there one with three lines, or are there any more areas we saw a reflection?
Travis: What about above the door? It is opposite of the mirror, right? If one's a door, and the other one's a door?
Laura: Okay, I'll blow above the door.
Liam: And I'm going to start blowing around the mirror.
Laura: We all walk around going (raspberries).
Travis: Constitution check to see who passes out first?
Matt: What was that?
Taliesin: Does the mirror have a fancy frame?
Matt: It's not extremely intricate, but it looks like there's a brass or bronze frame around it.
Taliesin: Are any of these symbols mirrored in the frame itself? Is there a mirror of any of these symbols in the frame?
Matt: As you look in the actual frame itself, you don't see anything that matches the symbols.
Laura: What if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons?
Sam: Except we have two twos, and no three?
Laura: I know. One, two, four!
Taliesin: No, because you have to hit one, and then you have to hit the two together--
Sam: And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can we do a sweep for more?
Travis: Can I clear off the door area that we walked through?
Matt: So Grog, you go through, (rapid blowing). Blowing around. Okay. Make an investigation check.
Marisha: I take my mantle and start doing a--
Matt: You clear that archway very well, around the door. You do reveal Dwarven runes on the upper right corner, upper left corner, lower right, and lower left corner of the doorframe.
Travis: I only know Dwarven writing. I don't know runes.
Matt: Well, the runes are part of the Dwarven language.
Travis: The runes are part of the Dwarven language, so I know them.
Laura: Pike goes over and she helps you.
Travis: Help me, Pike! Yeah, I would like to decipher what these symbols mean.
Laura: "If you lift me up, I could see the ones above the door!"
Liam: "Yeah, the last time I wanted you to do it on your own, but I think we're pressed for time."
Travis: I hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway.
Matt: Okay, so turning around, upper left corner. Okay. That one is the Dwarven rune that represents the number three.
Travis: Three. All right. Now, to the upper right-hand corner.
Matt: That is the number one.
Travis: Okay. I put her on the ground and I say, okay, look at the lower right-hand corner.
Matt: So lower right-hand corner would be a two.
Travis: And now the lower left-hand corner.
Matt: A four.
Laura: Oh, yeah! We know! That's the amount of times you have to push the button!
Taliesin: So one-one, two-two-two-two, three, four-four.
Sam: Possibly.
Laura: Wait, I think we reversed it.
Liam: How long does your unseen servant last?
Sam: Not too long.
Liam: How long? An hour? Ten minutes?
Sam: I'll look in my memory. One hour, but I have to be close to it. How big is this room?
Matt: It's a 20-foot radius from the center of the brazier, so it's 40 feet on each side.
Taliesin: Is our physicality of this map correct? If we show you this?
Liam: Well, I have this jar. It's an oil of etherealness. You could potentially be standing in here, but not be in here. Lasts an hour, though. Same time gap as your friend. You could stand in here and not be in here.
Sam: From the doorway to the mirror, is it less than 60 feet?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, then I can be out of the door. Am I right with what I wrote down there?
Matt: All right, so this is the-- facing from the inside--
Sam: Yeah, from the brazier-- Frasier Crane. Looking at the door that we came in. Right?
Matt: I'm going to have to draw you one. I think you guys got confused on that one.
Laura: I think me and Travis got it right.
Sam: I think, Matt, you're wrong.
Travis: I have the same thing as Laura.
Liam: I'm pretty sure it's up up down down left right left right A B A B.
Laura: I hope we passed the test.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Did we get it right?
Matt: There, that's what you get! Sorry, I'm limited in my reach right now.
Marisha: I love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different. We're like, numbers, somewhere!
Matt: Yep, almost. Almost.
Marisha: Did you help us, or are you just saying "almost?"
Matt: I'm saying, looking back and seeing where the numbers lie and the runes in there, you have the correct configuration.
Laura: (victorious laughter)
Marisha: I think this is right. I think you have this. I think I have the right part of this and you have the right part of this.
Laura: We'll copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct.
Travis: Yes.
Laura: No, this is wrong. I'm just going to draw it. (counting)
Sam: Guys, Shadow of War! It's a great game by-- I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers!
Laura: Okay, so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons.
Sam: Yes, so now we've just got to do it.
Travis: Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame?
Taliesin: I gave it a little bit of a rub.
Marisha: I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror.
Matt: Okay. It taps.
Travis: Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: Three. You smear a bit of ash, but eventually get some semblance of shine through. Nothing catches your eye.
Travis: It's clear. We found everything there is to find.
Marisha: Grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash.
Sam: All right, should we leave the room and have Mr. Invisible start tapping buttons? All right, we'll do that.
Laura: We step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons.
Liam: (singing) Scanlan Man, Scanlan Man. Does whatever a Scanlan can. Makes a guy, pushes buttons, Scanlan Man-- I'm out.
Taliesin: Look out!
Liam: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Marisha: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Taliesin: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Sam: Would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Shit.
Travis: Well, there's no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly.
Liam: Also, what about shooting the button or firing an arrow at a button?
Laura: Yeah but the buttons are on this side.
Taliesin: How high up are the buttons?
Matt: The buttons? The top are about ten feet up.
Taliesin: So if he had something that was-- if he had a mop, basically, he could probably tap it.
Laura: The buttons are on the side of the mirror, so we could shoot arrows at them.
Taliesin: But only if we're in there and then we don't need an unseen servant to do it.
Sam: Want to give him a pole or something?
Taliesin: Let's give him a stick.
Sam: Do we have a stick in the bag?
Travis: I have a lance.
Taliesin: Yeah, he has a lance.
Travis: It's almost broken.
Taliesin: My god, it will finally be useful one last time.
Liam: We do have three trammels.
Taliesin: No! We are not disengaging a smoke alarm with a fucking trammel. There is a limit!
Travis: You have a slightly splintered lance.
Laura: Okay. Let's hit buttons. Let's do it! Let's get through this room.
Taliesin: Let's explain to the unseen servant what he's supposed to do.
Sam: Matt, can he hold a lance, or is that violating some-- he's not allowed to hold weapons.
Matt: He can hold them. He can't attack; he cannot be a combatant. It can hold things for you.
Liam: He's like a Kids in the Hall character.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. You're not wrong.
Sam: I conjure an unseen servant, whom I will name Simon Two.
Taliesin: Electric Boogaloo.
Liam: Not cool, man, not cool.
Matt: All right. There's this brief shimmer, and you watch as a bit of ash displaces on the ground where two footfalls (landing noises).
Sam: All right, Simon Two, take this lance. We're going to go tell you what buttons to press over there, good speed-- good speed? (laughter)
Sam: Godspell. You'll be fine. Hope you don't like burning alive. So you tell me what to tell him, because I don't have the paper. Upper left? Upper right? What do we start with?
Marisha: It's this. Tell him to do this.
Laura: The reflection of that.
Sam: Okay, so two upper right. Two pokes. Oh, wait.
Laura: So the upper left corner from where we're looking.
Sam: Yes, we're going to go mirror image of this, so project that across the room.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, that was the mistake.
Matt: Okay, so pressing the upper left twice.
Sam: Yes, mirror image of this, so upper left. Let's try that.
Matt: Heads over, holding the lance. You watch the lance wobble, and it misses a couple times, (clicking) hits the button, and it clicks inward. The lance is pulled back and the button presses back out outward into its position.
Sam: Any door?
Matt: No door.
Laura: We'll know if we push it again then we did it the wrong order.
Matt: Second time, (clicking) pulls off, the button depresses.
Taliesin: All right, keep going.
Sam: So below it, two presses.
Laura: In the corner, bottom corner.
Sam: Just like your name, Simon  two.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: Okay, opposite corner, up. One press.
Laura: Upper right-hand corner.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: And then below that, bottom corner. Four presses.
Matt: (clicking) (laughter)
Matt: The fourth one hits. There's a moment of pause, and the mirror shimmers faintly. You watch as, almost like a stone thrown into the middle of a still pond, begins to ripple from the center, and as it ripples, each ripple seems to fade, until eventually the five-foot-wide mirror is now an oval portal that leads to darkness behind it.
Laura: Let's go in!
Marisha: I told you there was a room behind the mirror.
Travis: Yeah, let's go. Hurry! We don't know how long it will stay open for.
Sam: Simon Two is coming with us.
Matt: Okay. You hear the faint footfalls of sound behind, and Trinket takes a moment to try and squeeze through this small entranceway. Trinket had a hard enough time getting through the incline. (moans) Into the necklace. You make your way through the opposite side, and as you all step through, the portal remains open for at least a moment.
Laura: Hey, we did it, guys.
Sam: We beat a door.
Travis: We beat a door.
Marisha: Guys, it took 111 episodes, but we bested a door.
Liam: The last episode of the third campaign will be a door that we do not open.
Matt: So the darkness you step through leads into a ten-foot-wide hallway of similar dwarven stone. Same slightly angled hallways about ten feet tall or so, about five or six foot wide. You get a few steps in and about 20 or 30 seconds after you guys make your way in, the mirror portal behind closes up.
Liam: Can we see?
Marisha: Can you see through it?
Matt: Through the mirror?
Liam: I meant where we are. Are we in pitch black?
Matt: You're in pitch black, but you guys with darkvision can see there is a staircase not too far, maybe ten feet from where you stand into this next hallway.
Travis: Iron stairs? Stone stairs?
Matt: Stone stairs.
Liam: I've got a dagger out.
Matt: All right, lights up briefly and you get a little bit of a vision beyond that, and it's gradual stone steps. They're not too wide; they're made for dwarven gait, so there are many steps that are relatively shallow.
Travis: These are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow.
Sam: We can see it, Grog.
Liam: Pike says, "That's actually right".
Laura: Is there any traps?
Matt: You're welcome to search for traps.
Liam: And I'm going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs and look as I go for traps. One. I'm taking it, but I'm still going and looking for traps.
Matt: You do have reliable talent, don't forget.
Liam: Does that oversee ones? Because I've been counting ones as ones for a long time.
Matt: The reliable talent as a rogue specifically says any roll lower than a ten you take as a ten.
Sam: Any roll?
Matt: Well, not any roll. Any ability check he has to make.
Liam: Okay, well, we wrongly assumed that ones and 20s were king, but no.
Laura: So he rolled way better than me because I rolled a ten.
Liam: That's an 18. My one is an 18 now.
Matt: Yeah, because that's one of the cool things about rogues. You guys make your way up about 45, 50 or so feet up the stairway, you keeping an eye out, no traps, nothing catches your eye as iffy or strange, and the stairs now switch back into another set. It's a small landing and then it continues upward.
Liam: Okay, but I'm only going to go 40 feet in advance. That's like ten fucked rolls of mine from the past 30 games! Anyway, I love it.
Marisha: So it's a big 180, going right up?
Matt: Yeah, it's a switchback. The staircase ascends, then there's a landing, and it continues upward and around.
Laura: Do we hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join in that perception.
Matt: So you're joining them up the staircase?
Taliesin: I'm behind. You know, the standard--
Matt: All right, so you guys are keeping up.
Marisha: Did you fuck the roll, too? Oh, what the fuck!
Taliesin: I got a 25.
Matt: Seriously, welcome back after two weeks and people just cannot-- wow.
Liam: But do you remember when we were at home and we'd go six weeks without playing and we'd spend 45 minutes trying to remember what we did, how the rules worked, what our names were, who you were.
Taliesin: Vex is right.
Travis: 25, you said?
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay. It's hard to discern what shifting in the distance is not the rumbling from the ever-occasional titan footfalls, but nothing seems to catch your attention. Occasionally, you hear dislodged rocks and stones clacking across the stone floor and the steps, and every now and then you catch a stone or two fall past and eventually come to rest either near or below you. You continue up the switchback stairs and lead into a third switchback that continues upward.
Liam: 40 feet in advance.
Marisha: We are following behind.
Laura: Are you looking for traps as you go, brother?
Liam: I am. That is an 18, anyway.
Marisha: I still have my hands guiding Percy, our blind human.
Matt: Leading the old man forward.
Taliesin: (old man voice) Where's Steven?
Marisha: (laughs) Where's Steven?
Matt: You do not find any other traps. There's no other issues that worry you upon this climb. You do eventually come to the top of the third switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight curved cavern. The stairs stop and it leads into a continuation of the dwarf-like hallway structure that you had below, but it is curving around now, in sections. I would say, as opposed to a gradual curve, the design in the structure here has a very rigid, geometric shape, so the curvature is in sections.
Liam: Yeah, I appreciate it as I go, and I look for traps.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Love it. That's an 18.
Matt: Okay. Coming around the edge  no traps, no plates. Nothing catches your attention. However, this tunnel comes to an end, and it opens up into a larger crevasse than the one that you previously saw that held a number of city buildings of the remains of Thomara. It looks to be about 100 to 120 feet tall, you assume, from the bits of the stalactites that you can see, barely reaching the edge of your visual range. Very faint bit of light here, bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish color that dots the edges of this interior chamber.
Liam: And is it like where I killed that motherfucker? They were built into the cliff face, right?
Matt: Yes. This one is larger than the one you were in before, and you can see just beyond your visual range, a number of these buildings, partially crumbled in some places, some still standing obstinately against the ever-shifting interior of the titan's form, the chamber curling upward as the ceiling crawls higher and higher just beyond your visual range, and you can faintly see the images of dozens of thin bridges that weave over themselves across different levels, up into the higher portion.
Liam: I want to confirm an intuition and use my last Divine Sense and feel undead.
Matt: Okay, what's the range on that one?
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet? You do not sense any undead within the 60-foot range.
Marisha: I think we're in the lungs. I think we're in its chest cavity.
Liam: Speaking into the earrings; they're all behind me. I think we're in a more populous place with the undead cannibals, know what I mean? There's a very large cavern in here and a lot of room.
Taliesin: I'd be grateful if anyone got a sample of that bioluminescent fungus.
Marisha: I can get that. I'm interested.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up and get some?
Liam: We're on a schedule here.
Marisha: Well, if it's on the way. We have to go that way.
Laura: We have to go up, right? Does it look like there's openings in the ceiling?
Matt: Well currently you're the only one who's stepped into this entrance to look up, the rest of you are now exiting into the chamber.
Liam: I'll wait, obviously. Nothing's going to explode on my friends, so they catch up with me.
Matt: Okay, so they're all behind you now where this entrance is, and as you look past it, this hallway that you're entering, it looks like there was a doorway here. There was some sort of hinge on the edge that held a door that had since been broken or toppled forward. You can see pieces of the door that once held this entranceway, and a number of the buildings immediately to the right and left. That's where you stand, what do you want to do?
Laura: Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole?
Liam: Everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Not in a long time.
Travis: Is there shattered remnants of the door?
Matt: Yeah, you see a couple of shards here and there--
Travis: Any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the ground or anything?
Matt: Make an investigation check. Lot of investigation checks today.
Travis: Two.
Matt: You scramble about and find a couple of pieces that might be, but no, it's just more stone.
Marisha: Can I see any stairs carved in the side, in the walls, trying to head up to this-- is that what you just checked?
Laura: No, that's what I was about to look for, too.
Liam: Is there any movement, because there's bioluminescent shit on the walls in here, so there's a little bit of light, right? Yeah. 26.
Matt: 26. As you glance about-- once again, your vision, because there is very little light in here and the very, very faint bits of fungus in the distance that give you a sense of the shape of this entire chamber. There isn't enough light for you to make out any shape beyond the exterior of your visual range, so you can't really tell.
Liam: A second thing I want to look for is what other exits from this gigantic cavern. Ways through, up. Yeah, you looked, but I didn't look.
Matt: Let me finish what I was saying first.
Travis: Roll! Roll again.
Matt: But based on the size of this chamber and the bits of what small elements of structures that you can see of the architecture within, this definitely appears to be more of the heart of the city of Thomara when it was once at its ancient height. You can see at the very edge of your visual range a cracked central fountain that is empty and dry, and you see, just beyond your range, the exterior of a large temple-like building that rises out of the ability to see any more of its height and structure.
Taliesin: Temple.
Matt: But like I said, you guys are still standing at the entrance to this cavern.
Marisha: What about the temple? Why?
Sam: Want to fly through here? Can we fly?
Liam: I don't think we want to stay here--
Sam: I know, that's why we just fly through.
Liam: Find another exit, yeah, but where?
Travis: I'd like to see the temple, if I can.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Travis: Well look, all right, my gloves--
Laura: Keep your voice down.
Travis: (whispering) My gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan. So if maybe they harvested pieces of my gloves, and it's in a temple, I don't know, you smart people could do something with that.
Liam: Right, what's your plan? You expect us to come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are connected to that temple, and you're going to get what? A Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bonus for doing so?
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Are your Titanstone Knuckles exalted yet?
Travis: Yep. They're just buzzing.
Liam: Yeah, are they still dildoing on your fingers?
Marisha: Are they buzzing more?
Travis: Are they humming more?
Matt: Doesn't appear to have changed.
Travis: Nope, just humming.
Marisha: Step two steps closer.
Travis: Two steps closer to the temple.
Marisha: Do they appear to be buzzing more?
Travis: Are they appearing buzzing more?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Ooh! 19.
Matt: Not bad. Nope.
Taliesin: Is the temple on the way? Does it make sense to cross through the city, or does it make sense to fly up?
Liam: We're moving towards Vasselheim now. I'm negative on our chances of dealing with this before Vasselheim, but that's the goal, right?
Taliesin: We've got some time, and I feel like this city is an opportunity to find some more advantages.
Travis: We are also looking for the Sword of Kas. What's if it's in the temple?
Sam: Why would Vecna keep the thing that could kill Vecna near Vecna?
Liam: I'm pulling Percy aside. I hear you, but this is a city that has existed here for a long time. Vecna didn't create this city. Vecna doesn't own these people. This is a fucking mountain that existed and now they're going for a ride. What do these people have to do with Vecna?
Taliesin: It's not a city that just existed.
Liam: No?
Taliesin: This is a giant primordial beast that people inhabited. God only knows what existed in here.
Marisha: Yeah, but as we've already seen from the other tomb, it's already been heavily, heavily plundered.
Liam: And Vecna's just a user. This place was just sitting there. He lifted it up and took it away. These assholes don't have anything to do with--
Travis: Why did he choose this?
Marisha: How far away is the temple? Do we know? Can we football range guess it?
Matt: I'd say, because you guys have darkvision of 60 feet?
Taliesin: If gods really understood how this world worked, this would not be happening right now.
Matt: It's at about the 50, 55 foot areas where the wall begins, then it vanishes beyond that.
Liam: Percy, this shitbird has appeared like three times wherever we were.
Laura: Well, he's not going to be able to do that right now because I've got a fucking ring.
Taliesin: He doesn't necessarily know this place as well as--
Marisha: Hang on. How long have we been in here, versus how far have we been from Vasselheim? Because we are on a time crunch.
Travis: 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from Vasselheim. 200 miles. With steps of?
Taliesin: What was the average land speed of a laden undead?
Matt: You've been within the titan for, I'd say, roughly three and a half hours, maybe.
Liam: Yeah, he's 110 miles out from Vasselheim, at this point.
Travis: We have time to check the temple.
Sam: All right, let's swoop in and swoop out.
Marisha: Super fucking fast!
Taliesin: I'm not even saying look in it, let's take a look at what it--
Laura: Did I see any stairs?
Matt: You do not see any staircases within a 60-foot radius of where you're standing.
Taliesin: We might be harder to spot if we stay on the ground for now, anyway.
Marisha: I just want to say, we gave you guys the other temple, in which you found your stupid waistband, but we got really fucked up from it! Everything has a consequence and a price and shit. Nothing is free.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a fucking Trace. It's my last Pass Without a Trace, but I'm afraid--
Travis: No, don't do it.
Laura: What if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us?
Marisha: Let me do it. I have Pass Without a Trace and one more 2nd-level spell left. I'll do it. Save yours.
Liam: I'm also going to put something on the table here: we're trying to save Vasselheim, but we're also trying to save the world. We might not be able to do this without recharging before Vasselheim.
Taliesin: I'm aware.
Sam: You want to go to sleep in this undead city?!
Liam: No, but we're trying to save the world, not just a city.
Sam: So sacrificing Vasselheim so that we can feel better about a fight?
Liam: What if we lose the fight Scanlan? Then who fucking cares? Vasselheim is gone. Westruun is gone. Kaylie is gone. Everything's fucking gone if we fuck this up!
Sam: Well, let's stay on the path and see how long it takes.
Marisha: How about this? Hold. Wait! We still don't know how to get up there, right?
Sam: Is that purple eyeliner?
Marisha: Yeah, do you like it? Thank you. It's a little metallic. Thank you, I bought it while I was waiting for--
Travis: Oh my god!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: Okay. I hate to say split the party, but what if we split the party? What if a few of you check out your fucking temple, and then the rest of us try to figure out a way to get up.
Travis: I'm cool. I'll vote for a temple party.
Marisha: Temple party. Who else is on temple party?
Sam: They need somebody who can help them in there.
Liam: I hate the idea, but I'm the stealthiest motherfucker in this room.
Taliesin: And then you three on the carpet, you on the broom.
Travis: I need the carpet.
Marisha: So wait, just the two of you are going to go check out the carpet?
Laura: Vax is going in with you.
Sam: I feel like one person with magic should go with them. I'll go with them.
Taliesin: We're all ear-pieced.
Marisha: Okay, so Grog--
Liam: Everybody but Keyleth.
Sam: No, it's Keyleth, Vex, and Pike are going searching. The boys are going in the temple, and the girls are going searching.
Marisha: Okay, cool, I'm on board.
Taliesin: This is in no way, by the way, an amazing mirror of that one time underneath Kraghammer. They're just going to find another Clarota.
Liam: The boys all die. The girls go to glory.
Laura: I want to kiss Percy before he goes. Don't die in this stupid temple.
Taliesin: I will not die in this stupid temple.
Sam: I'm going, too.
Taliesin: I slap him in the face.
Laura: Right on, Scanlan. Sorry, Percy.
Matt: Who's traveling in what group?
Laura: Girls are going to look for stairs, the boys are going in the stupid temple.
Liam: I yank the druid in for a kiss.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh wait, shit. Your fucking ring.
Laura: Fuck! My fucking ring! We can't split the party.
Taliesin: Okay, can't split the party. We all go looking for the stairs. Oh, you asshole, stop it! (laughter)
Laura: He was really excited about it!
Matt: I was waiting on that.
Laura: Oh my god, he was so excited about it.
Sam: All right, into the temple. Come on, let's just fucking go to the fucking temple.
Matt: I was like, you guys literally had this conversation an hour ago, but okay.
Taliesin: Whatever we do, we can't split the party (fast-forward noise). Okay, we're going to split the party.
Travis: Sam saved our asses.
Taliesin: That was Cabin in the Woods shit.
Liam: 40 feet in advance, Vax walks ahead of the group, hating himself. Here we go.
Matt: Go for it. What are you doing, you're checking for traps?
Liam: I'm checking for enemies hiding.
Matt: So as you push forward--
Laura: We're stealthed, we're Pass Without a Traced.
Matt: Okay, then roll some stealth, guys.
Laura: She Pass Without a Traced us.
Matt: Right, then roll some stealth.
Sam: Oh, we're all rolling stealth?
Liam: 34.
Sam: 25.
Taliesin: 26.
Marisha: 26.
Laura: 39.
Travis: Natural one.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Sam: He's so excited about that temple.
Laura: Natural 20 for Pike! Oh wait, she gets disadvantage.
Matt: She has the boots that make it not at disadvantage.
Taliesin: First time ever.
Liam: But that's a lot of good.
Laura: So much good for one shitty--
Matt: You begin to push forward past the cracked fountain, heading ahead of everyone, keeping an eye out for what's ahead of you. The high walls of the temple-like structure begin to reveal themselves, standing ominous over the debris-strewn streets with shattered carts and bone fragments. The bone fragments faintly quaking beneath every footfall of the walking mountain that you currently are walking through. You see long-decomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond reanimation lying scattered across the broken street paths ahead of you, deep grooves marking the splintered bone. A tangled network of partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal themselves above you, carved from the mountain, contains a ghostly image of a multi-level metropolis long fallen. You, make a perception check.
Liam: 29.
Matt: 29. You can see, as soon as you get to where the fountain is, the center of the street ahead of you. Dozens of slow shifting creatures moving throughout the streets and rubble of crumbling structures. You can see now, many of the undead citizens of the catacombs are now wandering, shaken awake by the lumbering titan that now carries them within. You also see a very faint blue pulsing glow emanating from one of the windows of the temple.
Liam: Can we put the goliath on the carpet so he doesn't kick something or be himself?
Laura: We don't know that he rolled shittily.
Liam: I know that, but he's a big, blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be--
Travis: On the chain. Literally on the text chain.
Matt: Which, as you're saying this, you hear a (clattering), and you glance over real fast and watch as Grog is walking by and the edge of his-- which weapon do you have attuned right now? You have the Blood Axe? The Blood Axe hits the edge of a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a corner angle and is currently being held by a small barrel, and as the axe hits it, it shifts (crashing) and rolls and comes to a rest for a second with this clattering, grinding sound. Parts of it chip and break, but most of it remains strong and sturdy upon impact. At which point, you see at the edge of your visual range, about seven of the wandering creatures go (raspy groan) and begin slowly slinking their way in the direction of the noise.
Sam: So a rock just fell?
Travis: A big statue just fell.
Sam: And is in pieces?
Matt: Parts of it are broken. It's still pretty sturdy.
Taliesin: Let's try and serpentine around and see if we can trace back.
Liam: And they're to the right or the left or ahead of us?
Matt: They're ahead of you.
Laura: Do they look like they saw us?
Liam: Go left. Jenga, jenga, jenga. Can we put Grog on the carpet now?
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: We're trying to go up, right?
Sam: No, we're trying to go towards the temple.
Laura: Towards that pulsing light.
Liam: We've got a little bit of business, a little bit of activity ahead of us, so we want to curve to the left.
Travis: All right, we move accordingly.
Matt: All right. So you guys move along the left and curve around the side. As you begin to move along the edge, you watch as about eight of these mostly-skeletal dwarvish corpses begin to shamble in the direction of where the noise came from. You can see elements of their long-mummified skin pulled tight against elements of the rib cage and the skull. Bits of chipped teeth, now broken against whatever things it's attempted to chew on its long un-life. As they move past, two of them glance over in the direction of Grog, and then all of them shift over in the direction and begin rushing forward in your path.
Liam: What's the distance?
Matt: At this point, they're probably about 50 or so feet from where you are.
Liam: Oh shit!
Laura: We don't want to make too much noise. I'm going to shoot a couple.
Travis: We could just go straight up.
Laura: There's only eight of them. We can take eight undead.
Liam: Pickle walks forward and takes a knee and waits with her holy symbol of Sarenrae, waiting for them.
Laura: I take two of them by surprise. That's auto-crit.
Liam: Vax does the same, watching his badass sister, and Pike waits to turn whatever's left of them.
Laura: Yeah, they're super-silent arrows.
Liam: So what happens first?
Matt: All right. She's preparing for it, right?
Liam: Yeah. She's waiting until she sees them.
Matt: Oh, well she also has darkvision of 60 feet.
Liam: So she's waiting until they're within range of her holy abilities.
Matt: What's the radius on that one?
Liam: That's a good question, because I'm a rogue paladin. (sighs) Goddamn it.
Matt: That's all right.
Liam: What if I look in the sorceror rules?
Matt: Nope. 30 feet.
Liam: 30 feet. So she's waiting for the twins to do their work and anything that's left over she's going to scatter.
Matt: Okay. All right. So as she holds position--
Laura: So it's auto-crit?
Matt: They know you're there. It's not a surprise. There's as threat, and they're rushing. But you do have advantage on the hits because they don't see you.
Laura: Well great, that's great. 20?
Matt: That definitely hits.
Laura: Okay. Oh, the other one super-duper hits. It's a 19 plus 14.
Liam: 25, 31, natural 20.
Matt: Okay. All right. So go ahead and roll damage on those. Are you shooting two different skeletons or one each?
Liam: I'm after my sister. She talked before I did.
Laura: I'll see how the first arrow hits?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 14. Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark. Whatever. 14, 15, 16. Two lightning damage. Do I add anything? Sneak attack!
Taliesin: Been a while.
Laura: How do we D&D? Plus ten sneak attack.
Matt: Okay. So the first skeleton, the arrow hits it and the torso explodes behind with ribs shattering and scattering across the stonework, its body falling and collapsing to the ground.
Laura: I hit another one.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Liam: Oh, and we go first, so it's advantage.
Laura: 14 plus four lightning damage. And that is plus eight.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. This one right behind it, its jaw unhinged slightly. Its tongue made of this slick rotting material that dangles through the hole in the bottom of the jaw. Comes around the corner, and you watch as part of its head explodes off one side from the secondary arrow, taking out what remains of the center of its skull, and the body crumples to the ground. Two skeletons down.
Liam: Sneak attack hits the first time we connect, right?
Matt: Yeah. You don't have to roll damage for that one.
Laura: Oh. Sorry, I did sneak attack on the second arrow.
Matt: Well, you can do sneak attack once per round.
Laura: Okay. I did eight damage too much.
Matt: It was still enough.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You don't have to roll damage for sneak attack.
Liam: So then that one's gone?
Matt: A third skeleton now is ruined. You hit it with the arrow in the middle of the spinal column, and it folds on itself.
Liam: Okay. So paladin action-action and my bonus action. So that's the first of three. The last one's the one that was a critical hit so the second one goes onto the next whole skeleton. It's just an eight.
Matt: Okay. This one the arrow slides into the side of the skull, and it keeps coming forward towards Grog.
Liam: Okay. And then the last critical hit, which is Whisper again, because it bamfed back, is two plus eight is ten. Two and three. It's not that much. It's 15 total.
Matt: Okay. And that one does finish it. So that's three skeletons down. Grog, I want to to individually roll an initiative check for me.
Travis: Natural 20. With Gil's dice.
Matt: So as you guys are watching this happen, the other five rush in to close the gap, but you are at the ready, and you get to strike before they do.
Travis: Nice. Am I hitting them? Yeah, Okay. Reckless, great weapon master. 31 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay, cool.
Matt: Your minimum damage will kill them. So as the first one comes up towards you, you swing up. As you slam into it, you watch as its bony body blows up against the side of the nearby stone building and then scrapes to the ground.
Travis: Can I use the other strike on another?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Reckless great weapon. That'll hit. That's like 30.
Taliesin: If there's anything left on Grog by the end of this, I'll try to swipe them off with my sword.
Travis: 32.
Matt: All righty. So two more detonate on this point. So there's three left. They're closing in on Grog. Does Pike want to take her turn?
Travis: We might want to save that Turnt Undead.
Laura: No, I think we should save.
Liam: I've already said it, but she's whispering to me to hold. She's half of Pike right now. You're half of Pike right now.
Taliesin: I'd like to pop in and see if I could take a couple--
Matt: Make an initiative roll.
Laura: Don't shoot, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm not; I'm going to use my sword.
Liam: Pike holds, breathing hard, looking at them coming on.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Yeah, that beats them by one. So yeah, as the three remaining ones start charging in towards Grog--
Taliesin: I'm going to run in, draw the silvered sword, and take some swipes.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Let's take three swipes right out of here.
Laura: Pike can use her mace on anything left in that area.
Taliesin: That's one natural 20, one natural 19. Do I crit on a 19 with the sword?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind. And a two. But that might be enough, because I have a really high-- that's a 15 as my lowest to hit. Does a 15 hit?
Matt: 15 does hit. Yes.
Taliesin: So the 15 is-- That's 14 piercing damage to the first one with a silvered sword.
Matt: Okay. You rush up and you carve through the first skeleton, and it breaks on the ground in front of you.
Taliesin: Number two is 13 points of damage to the second one.
Matt: Okay. The second one, you bring the blade down into the skull and cleave it in half. You watch as part of its skull breaks off to the side and the jaw falls to the ground and the rest crumbles in place.
Taliesin: I twirl around and take my third wonderful pirouette attack, which is 20 points of damage.
Matt: Okay, and as the final one lunges forward, in a fervent-- strangely faster than you expect for a skeletal undead, it begins to accelerate towards Grog. And with that, you take the blade and take the head right off at the neck, and it falls and crumples to the ground.
Marisha: So it's like 28 Days Later zombies?
Travis: 28 Days Later, they run.
Marisha: He said that they were fast.
Matt: Well, the last one-- it was flavor.
Marisha: Just wanted to make sure they weren't special.
Matt: Okay. As you finish the fray and hold yourself, you wait and wait. You do not hear or notice any more advancing undead from that direction.
Travis: Okay, how about I don't move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue glowy window?
Taliesin: We have to stick together.
Laura: Is the glowy window within 60 feet?
Taliesin: No, it's far.
Travis: When we were at the opening, we were 50 to 60 feet away.
Matt: The temple where you guys were at, at the time was 50 feet away from you, but you would have crossed the other side of the hall. So now it's about 100 feet away from you. At this distance, you can see it's a round, almost cylindrical building, Colosseum-esque. And there's a small square window about every 25 to 30 feet. And it's big. It's large, but you can see that faint glow between multiple windows from this distance.
Travis: So should we fly up to that window?
Taliesin: I think it'd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak. Because if we're the air, they are going to see us.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And we still have Pass Without a Trace, so let's go.
Laura: Yes, we do. She cast it.
Matt: All right, now that this brief combat has finished, those who took place in it, which would be you, Vax, Grog, and Percy have to remake your stealth checks.
Laura: You're like, "Gladly!"
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: What about Pike? Because she just knelt down. She didn't really fight.
Matt: She stepped out of her stealth. She was making herself visible.
Laura: My natural 20 for Pike, wasted!
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: We still have Pass Without Trace?
Marisha: Yes. I didn't do anything.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: Keeping that concentration.
Taliesin: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Marisha: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Liam: You're the doctor! Keep your patients on the run!
Laura: 30 for Pike. 29 for me.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to slowly make your way along the left wall of this large cavern.
Liam: 37, by the way.
Matt: Good to know. As you slowly move through the shadows, dodging through open doorways and through windows, trying the best you can to stay out from the center thoroughfare of this opening, you see more and more of these undead. Dozens, maybe even a hundred have crossed your path at the perimeter of your visual range and you can see in the catwalks above too, with the faint bit of the orange glow, occasionally shapes breaking across the orange. This entire cavern is swarming.
Laura: (whispering) Do we still have the thing?
Sam: Oh, the filter? The censer?
Laura: Do we have it in the Bag of Holding?
Taliesin: We also have the herbs.
Laura: What if we use it? What if we use it and it just repels them?
Taliesin: When it's time. We don't have a lot of it.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a very small amount.
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Taliesin: Let's prepare it, and when it's time--
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Marisha: Yeah it's dried. I spent that time. I spent time during the break.
Taliesin: It's just burning the herbs, though. We don't need the censer. Just hold it in your hands.
Liam: Do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern? Or are we totally fucking turned around?
Matt: No. I mean you have a decent sense. You are maybe 100 to 150 feet from where you began. Because you've been moving slowly. Staying stealthily, you're moving very carefully and very slowly and judging by the shape of the cavern and where you are currently, you're about halfway through it, or close to halfway.
Taliesin: It's good that we didn't go on the catwalk.
Matt: The temple's on the opposite side of the chamber.
Liam: Oh! All the way on the other side. I thought it was central.
Matt: I'm sorry. When you entered the entrance, the temple was to the front and to the right of you. You guys curved around the left, on the other side of it, keeping a view on it so you could see it from across the way. Are you making your way across to the temple?
Liam: So it's pressed against the opposite wall of this big place?
Sam: Are the undead all around the temple?
Matt: Further in. Nothing directly around the outside of the temple. So you guys curve around the entrance where you came and slowly make your way towards where the temple emerges from the rock wall. About a third or so of its exterior wall is actually built into the side of this cavern, and the large cylindrical-like Colosseum temple structure curves outward. You can see as you get closer to it, there's maybe the three floors to it but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and you can see areas where it looks like it's sustained some physical damage or eroded over time. You eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This is an old temple.
Liam: Is that light you talked about coming from one specific source, or all over the place? Every window.
Travis: Is there a story?
Matt: It looks to be coming from the base.
Liam: From down below.
Laura: Can we see in one of the windows?
Matt: You can look inside. Make a perception check.
Sam: Are there any bone laying around?
Matt: Plenty.
Sam: I am going to pick up two bones, give them to Simon Two, and tell him to go across the street, 50 feet away from us, and wait there in some building. Hold these bones.
Matt: You watch as two bone shards slowly glide over, then stand there.
Laura: 34.
Matt: Okay. As you pull up to the window and glance down, you immediately look inside the temple, and you see about 30 or so silhouettes of shambling dwarven corpses all standing inside the base floor of this temple. You see the silhouettes and shapes because they are all faintly outlined from the source of this blue light. You see a small, baseball-sized, bluish crystal that is resting, not in the perfect center of the temple but somewhere in the open middle floor area, and it looks like these 30 undead are surrounding it, and standing.
Sam: Smash and grab. You could go in there and get that thing, be out before they even saw you in there.
Taliesin: Also, have your unseen servant make a bunch of noise and have them all--
Marisha: Be a distraction?
Laura: Yeah, but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds.
Taliesin: We can have the unseen servant pick it up.
Marisha: How far away can he be, though?
Sam: He's 50 feet away, right now, and he's waiting to make noise.
Taliesin: What if he were to go in and get it himself?
Sam: He could.
Travis: He is invisible, isn't he?
Sam: He could go and pick it up and come right back with it.
Laura: But first don't tell him to come right out, tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they follow the light.
Liam: But what are our options if that doesn't work?
Sam: If he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work, or it doesn't move?
Liam: I want to do that. If that doesn't work, I can click the boots, and I can be there in a heartbeat and run, but what do we do next?
Sam: We need an escape plan, right? How many can fit on the carpet?
Liam: This goes back to my conversation with you, which is: are we going to find a pocket and rest?
Taliesin: Yes, but not here.
Liam: Agreed, but we're talking about Vasselheim, and is damage to Vasselheim a sacrifice needed to be ready to do what's necessary?
Travis: If he destroys Vasselheim, he does his miracle, his display of power, and he will be even stronger. That is not an option.
Taliesin: If we were to be clever, if we're at the edge of Vasselheim, the Vasselheim forces will be distracting his forces, so we'll have less to deal with, so we want this fight to happen at the edge.
Liam: So we're talking about no rest. I'm not talking about a short rest.
Taliesin: There will not be a long rest, I don't think.
Laura: There might be.
Liam: Not without him spilling into Vasselheim.
Marisha: I've been very conservative with what I've been doing for a reason.
Travis: I don't think a long rest is in the cards.
Taliesin: I've only burned one thing that requires a long rest.
Marisha: I agree with Grog. We can't sacrifice having him gain all of those followers, because then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers, which I'm not really comfortable with.
Travis: And he may be too strong at that point.
Sam: We don't need to discuss this now. We need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here!
Taliesin: If we can pull this off without burning anything important, then it doesn't matter.
Marisha: I want to go on record and say I think this is stupid. Okay, let's go.
Laura: That crystal looks really appetizing, and I want it.
Travis: How about we get ready to leave? I'll get on the carpet.
Laura: It looks really super magical.
Travis: Who's on the broom with Vex?
Laura: Me.
Travis: No, who is on the broom with you?
Taliesin: I'll be on the broom with her.
Travis: Do you want to get on the carpet with me?
Sam: Yeah, of course.
Marisha: I have to come with you because I have the Pass Without a Trace spell.
Taliesin: We all have to be together. We can't separate.
Travis: And he can fly.
Sam: No, he can't. He's done with his wings.
Liam: Yeah, that's right.
Sam: We have too many people for the carpet and the broom.
Liam: My wings are gone. There's no wings for Vecna unless we rest.
Travis: Well, kick Trinket out of the necklace, and I'll get in there.
Taliesin: I can also climb up the wall, if need be.
Sam: We can leave Trinket.
Liam: It's fine, I still have the boots. Just the wings. It was death or wings. I chose wings.
Travis: All right, so how do we fly? How do we do that?
Sam: I can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something.
Taliesin: Just for shits and giggles, I'm going to take one last look around to see if there's any infrastructure for getting up. There must be infrastructure for getting up here. There wasn't layers of a city on top of each other.
Sam: We could just run.
Liam: But wait, where are we going though if we get this thing?
Sam: Up away.
Liam: We have no verification of an exit or a hole or anything!
Travis: Yeah, sometimes you just got to leap, okay?
Liam: That's my entire life, but this is the last moment.
Sam: Every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit, right? Wait, no, lungs don't; they just have the one.
Marisha: Wait up, we argued more this game more than anything else. Okay, we know we still have to fly upwards, including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right?
Laura: No, the blue crystal is right here.
Marisha: Well, then what the fuck?
Laura: I don't know!
Liam: We have a plan for getting the crystal, just not how to get the fuck out.
Marisha: We fucking fly!
Travis: Who burns a spell to become an animal?
Marisha: I can burn a spell.
Travis: You do that.
Marisha: We're probably going to take another short rest, right?
Travis: Probably.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I can recall Simon 2. I can send him across the room, make a bunch of noise, draw a bunch of people over there. You run, grab the crystal, and then we hustle out of there.
Travis: What if only half the room leaves, though?
Laura: No, you go get Simon 2 to go get the crystal.
Sam: And there's going to be a floating crystal that marches across?
Travis: They don't give a shit. Do it. I'm on the carpet. We're ready to go.
Marisha: You're on me? And you're on carpet, and you're on broom?
Travis: Percy and Vex are on the broom.
Matt: Gnomes on the carpet with Grog. You and Percy on the broom. You're transforming into what creature?
Marisha: Giant eagle.
Matt: Giant eagle.
Marisha: Not yet, though.
Laura: And then we all, within 60 feet of each other, fly up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Okay, who's doing what?
Laura: Simon 2.
Sam: Simon 2 is going to go get the thing. Let's say they all start watching the thing come towards us. Grog, are you here? Are you with us?
Travis: Yeah, I have to be.
Sam: Can you throw something across the room to make a noise?
Travis: Yep. I can absolutely do that.
Laura: I'll prime an arrow.
Travis: I have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it. It will even burn when it lands. It's been sitting in there for four years.
Sam: This is a terrible plan.
Taliesin: This is why we hoarded it in the first place.
Sam: Guys, I'm just going to say this one more time before we do this: he's way faster than Simon 2. Simon 2 could create a distraction. He could (snatching noise).
Liam: Scanlan, only with the boots.
Travis: If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel, and we'll leave.
Taliesin: If they chase the jewel, we can grab it and run, anyway.
Sam: All right, Simon 2. Come back with your bones!
Matt: The bones shift over towards you ever-so-slowly.
Liam: (singing) Don't worry, be happy now.
Sam: All right. Simon 2, go to the middle of the room. Throw the bones away, far, then grab the crystal. You don't have pockets. Run back to us! Away, yeah. Should he cover it with a blanket or something? Do you have a hood?
Matt: The bones begin to drift.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm not saying no.
Laura: A handkerchief to put over the light.
Sam: So it blocks the light? All right, so go put this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only hope.
Matt: Is Simon holding bones or a blanket?
Sam: He's holding a blanket.
Taliesin: He's holding a hanky.
Laura: He's holding a hanky.
Travis: Put the bones down gently.
Sam: Give me the bones. I put the bones down. Here's a handkerchief. You'll put it over the crystal, pick up the crystal, and bring it back to us.
Matt: Simon begins to slowly walk, the handkerchief floating by.
Taliesin: This is like those little handkerchief ghosts you would make in kindergarten.
Matt: As you glance inside and watch as it happens, you can see all the undead that are in there are standing, unmoving, swaying a little bit in place. Simon's about 30 feet out from them. About 20 feet out. They don't notice his presence. You notice that all the undead are facing the crystal, by the way.
Laura: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: (laughing) That's crucial information.
Sam: Right before he picks it up, hock a rock as far as you can.
Travis: Not the lantern?
Taliesin: Not the rock, the lantern. Light the lantern and throw it.
Marisha: By the way, they're all staring right at you. They're 100 percent aware of what's going on.
Matt: They're not staring at you. They're staring at the crystal.
Laura: They will be staring at us. What if we destroy the crystal? I wonder if all the undead would die. Let's keep going.
Matt: The handkerchief makes its way forward. Simon walks between the undead, and they don't even notice.
Sam: That's a good guy, that Simon 2.
Marisha: What happens?
Matt: The handkerchief moves over onto the crystal, and all the undead look over to the crystal, and the crystal lifts, and they all begin to (groans).
Travis: I take the hooded lantern and I (laughs) I throw the fucking piss out of it.
Matt: Make an attack roll. Roll and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Oh, that's good! 19.
Matt: You're adding your strength modifier to that? Yeah. You're aiming at the opposite end?
Travis: If the entrance is here, I'm throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are.
Matt: With your strength? Easy enough. You lob it. It arcs over (flame noises) and explodes. The oil spreads across the ground. Flames ignite, and the bright light that emanates from it and the flames burst, and all the undead turn over (grunting) and begin to retract away. Two of them are following Simon. Only two of the undead are following Simon, currently. The others are distracted by the detonation of flame. They look confused.
Liam: How close are the pursuers?
Matt: They're making their way slowly. No, they're much faster than Simon.
Liam: I'm throwing.
Laura: I'm going to get down and shoot.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just the ones following Simon!
Matt: Both of you guys roll an attack.
Travis: Are they far away from the other ones that aren't leaving yet?
Taliesin: It doesn't matter; they're not paying attention.
Laura: 25. No, 33.
Liam: 29.
Matt: Roll damage.
Taliesin: They drop out of nowhere. They faint. It's going to be good.
Marisha: So we hope.
Taliesin: I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Travis. Come on. Now is not the time to get squeamish.
Laura: 24.
Taliesin: We made a solemn oath.
Sam: They were innocent.
Taliesin: We agreed, weeks ago.
Liam: I rolled a 77 for mine.
Sam: 77?!
Matt: These two skeletons almost atomize. As they're walking, they're both gaining on Simon, and as they both start reaching towards where the dull bluish glow, mostly muted by the handkerchief, is floating in the air, they (growl) towards it. You watch as both their heads and torsos scatter across the ground, like a heavy wave of force blasted them across the stonework. The scraping sound hits as the detonation hits. The flames are dying down, and... no, no other undead see it. Slowly, the stone floats past, out of the doorway, and makes its way back to you.
Taliesin: Drop it in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: At this point, Simon's getting real close to the end of his hour-long casting time.
Sam: You've served us well.
Travis: Bag of Holding. It doesn't hurt my hand, or anything, does it?
Matt: No.
Travis: Cool! We've got that.
Matt: Whatever it is.
Laura: I guess we have it.
Marisha: Nothing happened to them when we put it in the Bag of Holding? They were like, (groaning) and kept going? All the undead?
Matt: All the undead inside that were distracted by the explosion of the lantern are riled up now, and they're starting to wander around, and some of them are starting to make their way towards the entrance to the temple. Some are making their way toward the staircase to head upward.
Marisha: Are we flying?
Travis: Yes, we fly up.
Matt: All right. You go into eagle form, grab Vax, and all of you guys make your way up into the cavern entrance.
Laura: Bubble. Tight bubble.
Matt: Currently, I believe the eagle form has darkvision. Right now, you have no light source.
Liam: I do. I can say things to her. I can see.
Matt: Right, so you guys are able to maneuver. So as you guys head up into the center part of the cavern, above the catwalks, you can see as you push through, about a third of them are still standing. A lot of them have collapsed in the center, and there's edges of bridges that come to a halt where they've collapsed and tumbled down into the cavern below. You can see straggling undead wandering the catwalks and these pathways along the edges of the cavern. As you pass forward through them-- I imagine you guys are cruising through as fast as you can?
Taliesin: Trying to avoid them.
Laura: We'll try to avoid the clusters.
Matt: A few of them seem to glance up and see you as you pass and reach, but they have nowhere to go. As you begin to cruise through the center of this cavern, following it to the opposite side, it widens further, and now as you look down, faintly, you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent fungus that are growing within this city below. You can see elements of these beautiful statues that are partially crumbled. You can see small homes that litter the center of this chamber. You can see some of the catwalks that meet in the center of this actually meet in a suspended platform that contains another dome-like structure that is partially caved in. With another shake and impact of the titan's footfall, you watch as one of its suspension pillars cracks, and the entire center finally gives way and falls and slams down, collapsing into the center of the chamber, it being there for the final moment of its tensile strength. As it slams down, you watch as it crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below, and from that blast, you can see something on the interior of it was apparently explosive or flammable, and it explodes, giving a brief flash of light into the center of this cavern. Where you had the brief outside of your visual range, you now look around and see the entirety of these dozens of catwalks and the city below you. Hundreds and hundreds of roving skeletons and mostly decomposed, mummified dwarven corpses that all glance towards this explosion. Some have been blasted away from it by the impact of the detonation. Others are making their way towards what the strange sound was, drawn towards it, but you're keeping this central safe space between, where none of them can grasp or assail you.
Laura: Were there other buildings like that, ready to fall from the ceiling?
Matt: Currently, what you see is just the one.
Liam: I'm looking for gaps or holes or anything in the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out. MATT; You see entrances to homes that are built into the sides.
Sam: What about a tunnel or anything?
Matt: Make a perception check. Anyone who has darkvision can make a perception check.
Marisha: I have keen sight. Does that count?
Matt: You have advantage on your perception.
Marisha: Oh, shitty and shittier.
Liam: 27.
Travis: 18.
Laura: 18.
Sam: I didn't do one.
Marisha: 28.
Sam: I'm weeping over Simon 2.
Matt: Oh. Your keen eagle vision-- wait, you said you rolled shitty and shittier and still got 28?
Marisha: I have a plus 13, plus advantage.
Matt: Right. All right, cool. So glancing through your eagle vision, you can see the top of the chamber almost seems to come to a conical shape, and as you look up to the top of it, it emerges into a completely vertical chamber that rises up and out of the central opening of the city of Thomara.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: I take the lead, I guess. (caws)
Laura: (shushes) Caw quietly.
Liam: Vax is trying to appreciate his last ride.
Travis: Debbie Downer.
Liam: No way! I'm not going to stop. Fuck you all. Every game until the end, motherfuckers!
Matt: As the group of you make your way up into this vertical cavern, we're going to take a break. I need to take a break, myself.
Travis: Remember, we have the--
Travis: Sponsored announcement.
Matt: That's right. We have the Shadow of War video coming up at this break to give you a glance at this game coming up that we're all part of. If you haven't seen it, or if you have seen it, check it out, anyway. It's pretty awesome. Also, for this week's giveaway, Wyrmwood, we've got a little video for you here to show you what's up and what you can do and try to win it at the break, so pay attention, stick around, and we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.
Liam: This is what's up!
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so last we left off, you guys were all traveling upward through various means of flight, through a peak in the central cavern chamber in the center of Thomara, the long-dead dwarven city. As you begin to climb upward through this 15-foot-wide or so upward hallway, this cylindrical cavern, you continue upward for about 50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of this chamber, and then it opens up into a domed room. Immediately, as you fly up, you see a ceiling come up, and you have to coast off to the side. You catch yourself, hovering there as the rest of you guys make your way in there. This domed, mushroom-shaped chamber with a very thin, circular floor around the outside with the hole that you entered at the bottom. Whoever would stand on the edge there would have the opportunity to either leap into or toss something down into this hole that would then drop them right into the center of the city.
Taliesin: Weird question  if I were holding the blue gem and had dropped it down this hole, what would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up?
Matt: Not at all. It was a ways off.
Taliesin: Just checking.
Laura: Are there any undead around us right now?
Matt: Currently? Glancing around, you do not see any undead.
Marisha: You said things or people? Is this a body-sized hole?
Matt: No, it's about 15 feet wide. The full chamber is maybe 50 or so feet across. About a 20-foot walkway, circular, before the hole in the center.
Liam: Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave, or does it look made?
Matt: If you glance down and look about the interior of this chamber, it is not natural. It is all carved.
Laura: Can we look at the gem for a second, since there's no undead around?
Matt: If you want to. Grog has it.
Travis: Do you want me to pull it out?
Laura: Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it?
Sam: Sure. I can look at it.
Laura: How big is it? Is it baseball-sized?
Matt: It's about that big.
Travis: No undead, right? No creatures, nobody that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light?
Laura: We can't see anything around us?
Matt: Not at the moment, no.
Sam: I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18 arcana check.
Matt: Okay. It's definitely magical. The blue light from it grows stronger, then weaker. Stronger, then weaker. It has this rhythmic flash to it, like a heart or something that has a pulse to it.
Marisha: How is it lining up towards the steps of the giant?
Matt: Not at all. It's much quicker.
Marisha: Much quicker.
Matt: It's cold to the touch.
Taliesin: Does it do anything to the Titanstone Knuckles?
Liam: Is it faster than my heartbeat?
Matt: It's slower.
Liam: Slower.
Travis: That's slow.
Marisha: So it's very slow, but not as slow as the rate he's walking.
Travis: Is it a cut jewel, or is it rough?
Matt: It's rough. No jeweler's hand has touched it. There are some edges that have flat surfaces; it looks like there have been things that have chipped off the stone.
Taliesin: Does it have the vibe of something petrified?
Matt: No, it has almost a quartz-like look to it. Elements of it appear to be cloudier or imperfect, and some areas appear to be clearer, and light shines through a little brighter.
Liam: It's like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals.
Matt: Yeah, but there is an enchantment.
Sam: What about Pikey-pants? Can she detect if it's evil or good or something? Does she do that?
Laura: You should do that.
Liam: I'm going to do that.
Matt: Okay. You don't get a sense of any evil from the stone.
Sam: You said no sense of evil?
Matt: No evil coming from the stone.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to gaze into it super hard.
Matt: You look really hard into the stone as you hold it to your face, and your eyes almost cross as you glance into the very core source of this pulsating arcane energy. It's bright.
Laura: So bright, y'all.
Matt: It hurts a little bit, and you wince after a while.
Laura: I saw so many things.
Liam: She looked at the eclipse, too.
Travis: We don't have Identify or anything like that, do we?
Marisha: No.
Sam: No.
Laura: You know who had that?
Sam: No, who?
Laura: Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful.
Sam: Who is it? Oh, the fancy fellow? He's probably dead somewhere.
Travis: I think we should try and smash it.
Sam: Don't you think that about everyone and everything?
Marisha: I'm not against this idea.
Travis: What else are we going to do to it before we face El Vecna?
Taliesin: My only other thought of how it could be useful, at this point, with what we know about it--
Sam: Is "El Vecna" Spanish for Vecna?
Travis: Sí.
Taliesin: It seemed like the undead were crowding towards it, which means that if we do get attacked by a group of undead, we might be able to shiny-object them, unless, of course, it's dangerous in their hands.
Travis: Or we spike it down the hole, and it causes a hydrogen bomb, and we shatter this titan in half.
Taliesin: That literally made the dungeon master laugh, so I don't know if that's necessarily--
Travis: It's blue, right? That is the color of hydrogen.
Taliesin: That's the color of Dr. Manhattan. I don't necessarily know if it's the same thing.
Travis: It is known.
Sam: Why don't we hang onto it for now? In a moment of peril, we can throw it or smash it.
Taliesin: Not crazy, trying to crack it.
Liam: What if it stops this thing where it stands? We're all thinking that this thing could be its heart.
Sam: Its heart?
Travis: It's palm-sized, right?
Taliesin: It could be a chunk of heart.
Laura: Is it the same color as his Knuckles?
Travis: No, these are stone-gray. This is blue crystal.
Matt: There's nothing about it that gives you the sense, based on what you've seen both outside and within the titan, that it is of similar essence to the titan, from what you understand.
Travis: It could be a soul or something.
Sam: Soul glow?
Travis: Does Pike have anything that detects a soul?
Liam: It's not evil. It's not good. It could be the thing that's keeping these undead moving.
Travis: Well, then I don't know what else to do. I think we keep moving.
Liam: I like the spiking idea.
Laura: I'm okay squishing it with the hammer.
Liam: I think that you should let me squish it, because if that blows up--
Laura: I think it's funny that we spent so much time getting it, and then we're going to destroy it.
Liam: We spent ten minutes getting this thing.
Travis: We'll think about smashing it when we take our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself.
Taliesin: Hold onto it for now. It could come in handy.
Marisha: It's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a purpose.
Sam: All right, focus!
Laura: Let's get out of this dome.
Travis: Is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered?
Matt: On the edge of the circle? No. It's smooth stone, intently designed to be a drop or opening of some kind.
Taliesin: Are there exits?
Matt: Make an investigation check. You don't see any doorways or passageways.
Marisha: Wait, there's not a hole that we can go up?
Matt: There's a hole that you came through to come into this chamber. Imagine a dome. You're in the chamber.
Taliesin: I literally rolled a one. I'm aware that there's a hole.
Matt: You get vertigo as you stand in the chamber.
Laura: Is this investigation or perception?
Matt: You look about, and you don't see any exit. Investigation to see if there's any hidden or not-immediately-noticeable exits or entryways.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. As you do a pass around, looking closely along the wall, you see two small domed doors that have metal rods jammed through, almost like a small barricade that's been placed down on one side of a doorway. However, they are closed from this side.
Laura: So you could open them up?
Matt: You could.
Laura: Are they trapped? I'll look to see if they're trapped.
Liam: On it.
Travis: Also fair to assume that whatever's on the other side of that door--
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27?
Laura: I rolled an 18.
Matt: You're both looking at the same one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Neither of you notice any traps.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to try to jimmy open that lock.
Travis: Whoa.
Laura: I already said it.
Matt: Make a strength check.
Liam: Not locked.
Laura: Two! Wait. Yeah, that's straight-up strength, not a saving throw? Two!
Sam: Two?
Laura: I'm really fucking weak. You'd think I'd be stronger pulling the bowstring, but no.
Travis: Use your legs. Really, use your legs.
Laura: Okay. I put my legs up on the wall and (grunts).
Matt: It is not budging.
Liam: Can I use my finger skills to see if it's locked? Just my finger skills. I made a perception check to see if it's trapped. Wouldn't I know if it's locked?
Matt: The lock is the barricading mechanism on it. There is no handle.
Liam: I'm going to try to sidestep this lock with my lock-picking skills.
Travis: It's a barricade.
Marisha: It's a barricade.
Liam: There's nothing to do?
Marisha: It's like steel rebar in front of the door.
Travis: Is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door? Anything other than a portal to go through?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The room's pretty simple. The construction of it may be older than most of the things that you've seen in the city below and previous chambers. It seems to be built almost for function rather than ceremony.
Laura: It's a trash chute.
Marisha: That's what I was going to say. Is it a water chute? Drainage? Is this a drain pipe?
Laura: We could fill the city with water. Drown all the zombies.
Matt: One thing you do notice, which is interesting as you're glancing around at the side, looking at the ground at the bottom of it, there's a very faint groove in the ground that leads toward the central hole at the base of each of these doorways.
Marisha: Does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room?
Matt: No, just the two doors on the opposite sides.
Travis: How far apart are the doors?
Matt: Opposite sides of the chamber, yeah.
Taliesin: So there's a bar. The door is barred, then?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: So break it. Let's get out of the way and pop the bar. See if we can pop the bar right off the door.
Travis: Do we want to have Keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through, and she can Wall of Stone the door?
Marisha: I'll be with you. Yeah. I'm right behind you, man.
Travis: I will try and remove one of the doors. I don't know how to delineate between them.
Taliesin: The left one.
Travis: Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25.
Matt: 25. It immediately comes off to the side, and when you lift it, you realize that it's bolted to the wall to the side, and it curves upward and holds it in place. This is meant to stay in place.
Laura: Wow. Really? It was meant to move? I think I loosened it for you, Grog.
Travis: I didn't get that sense at all.
Matt: As you lift it up, the door is now unbarred.
Travis: Shall I?
Laura: Yeah, open the door!
Travis: Are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me?
Matt: It looks like it opens towards you, yes.
Travis: I'll pull open the door.
Marisha: I'm at the ready for whatever.
Matt: Okay. We'll say as you entered and landed, the door on the left. Okay, so as you pull that one open, immediately preparing yourself, a couple of rocks tumble out, and it reveals a packed-tight mass of earth and stone.
Laura: Shit! Let's try the other one.
Travis: Should I punch the rubble?
Laura: No, let's try the other door first.
Travis: I make my way around.
Taliesin: We set ourselves up.
Travis: 20 on the dot.
Matt: 20. (metal creaking) It lifts over without an issue. Pull the door open. You lift it open, and a few rocks tumble past, but a slick rockslide incline continues upward, dry, no water. Nothing.
Travis: A rockslide continues onward. Slick, dry.
Laura: How big is the tunnel?
Matt: It's about four feet wide or so.
Laura: So we can fit in?
Matt: Yeah, you can fit in.
Taliesin: We have some Immovable Rods.
Matt: When I say slide, I mean smooth stone, like an actual slide. You get the sense that there was some sort of aqueduct-type scenario.
Laura: We brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we don't slide down.
Taliesin: Whoever's in the back should have the Immovable Rods, so if there's a sudden rush of water, we can create a grate for ourselves.
Matt: You envision that at one point, long ago, this would have been a beautiful waterfall in the center of Thomara's chamber that has now dried.
Travis: Dope. That's awesome. I'm getting creepy as fuck now. I've got the Immovable Rod; I'll be the caboose.
Marisha: I've got the other one, so I'll be second.
Matt: So Grog is the caboose.
Marisha: Keyleth in front of Grog.
Matt: Keyleth in front of Grog? All right. Who's in front of them?
Sam: Me.
Matt: Scanlan.
Laura: Pike.
Matt: Then Pike. All righty.
Taliesin: Myself and the twins, I suppose.
Laura: Yeah. I want to be in the front.
Travis: I'll go ahead and take the Immovable Rod out and have it in my hand.
Marisha: Samesies.
Matt: So you've got both of those. Oh, I totally forgot there was a winner for this. I'm sorry. I should do that, huh? RyanBoo, you're the winner. Danoba will contact you and get you your cherry deck box soon. Now that's taken care of. You make your way up the slide, and it's relatively gradual; it's not too heavy of a scenario. You make your way upward, upward, and about 30 or so feet up, the walls of it separate out and appear to break into two smaller chambers, like this was a breaking point where a person could enter from either side to check on the flow or do maintenance on whatever the ducting was. The slide continues upward. Vax and Vex, you get to that portion and lift yourselves up, looking right to left. It ends on one side, and it looks like there's some dry-rotted wooden crates, and to the left, a staircase.
Marisha: So it looks like a landing?
Matt: It's a brief landing for somebody who needed to come in and do repairs, maintenance, or checking on the flow of water.
Laura: Keep going up the slide or take the stairs?
Liam: Quick glance in the crates?
Marisha: No, if you're going to take a quick glance, then we have to bust them open like a proper RPG.
Travis: They're dry-rotted. They'll break easy.
Matt: They will. What do you do?
Liam: Check them out. I eat some edamame.
Matt: So you lift the crates. There are only two of them, and they're relatively small: two feet by two feet. The first one, you open up and look inside, and there are rusted tools. Long iron bars; some appear wrench-like. It looks like whatever mechanism was used as the early aqueduct system for this, this box contained materials, though you're uncertain as to what their application was into this system.
Taliesin: I'll take a glance at these things to memorize their general shape.
Travis: After you're done with them, I'll actually take them.
Matt: You go and grab a few. There's five rods of varying widths. Some appear to be ratchet elements, where they fit around different metal caps. There's one that looks like a wide crowbar that's used to hold or wedge elements separately. Very basic; nothing too intricate.
Taliesin: This is some basic shit that you're picking up right now.
Liam: That was the first crate. What's the next crate? Is it whoopee cushions?
Matt: No, the next crate you open up and it looks mostly empty, but it looks like there are a couple of rows of small glass vials, half of which appear to be broken or shattered, but there are three remaining, with a faint bluish liquid on the inside.
Laura: Does that sound familiar to us at all?
Liam: Healing potions are blue.
Matt: These don't resemble healing potions, actually.
Taliesin: Do these resemble underwater breathing?
Matt: They do. You've seen these before.
Liam: For toilet diving.
Taliesin: Emergency, yeah. Let's take those.
Travis: Okay. I got them.
Liam: I give one of them to Percy for being so sharp. I give one to my sister. You don't need it. I keep one. No, I don't. I'm barely alive. I give one to Scanlan.
Sam: I give it to Grog.
Travis: I've got one. I've got two, actually.
Sam: All right, then I'll keep one.
Taliesin: Just in case.
Travis: I've got two vials of underwater breathing.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Why is there no water running?
Travis: Any other boxes to smash?
Matt: No.
Marisha: I'd imagine because he's vertical now instead of horizontal.
Travis: And undead.
Sam: Let's keep going up the stairs.
Matt: All right. Heading up the stairs in the same order?
Liam: 30 to 40 feet in advance.
Matt: All righty. 30 to 40 feet in advance? Okay. You make your way up the staircase. Roll stealth.
Travis: Immovable Rod's out.
Liam: 28 for stealth.
Matt: Okay. Are you stealthing, as well? Are you going along with him, or are you letting him go ahead?
Liam: She's coming.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: All right, so the two of you very quietly make your way ahead, the rest of you keeping within, I assume, the range of the ring. The staircase doesn't go too far; it goes maybe 30 or so feet, and then it opens into a hallway. You're stepping up through the floor, and there's about ten feet behind and to the sides of you. There's a slight element of a cave-in to the left of you, where part of the stone seems to have collapsed, and a bit of the earth has filtered in. It's a smooth stone floor that's tiled in places. The walls continue on, a somewhat trapezoid-like angle. There are other portions of the wall that have caved in on certain elements, and there are two large pillars that mark the center of this hallway, either used as support beams or decorative, but they go from ceiling to floor. You glance over the side, and you see a distant staircase on the far end of this hallway, maybe 80 to 90 feet from where you are, if not further, with larger stairs. You've seen some of the dwarven-based ones. These seem to be a little more grandiose as they lift up higher and higher. Part of that hallway is completely collapsed; it's a wall of fallen earth. But there's a hole carved out of it. There's a tunnel that has been pushed through. You hear this very faint buzzing sound. Very faint. This (low humming). A very faint vibration. You also see a figure stepping from a side wall crevasse, an opening of a similar shape to the circular opening in the wall.
Liam: I hide.
Laura: We were stealthed.
Matt: You guys were stealthed. You re-hide, while stealthed.
Liam: That's what I do.
Matt: You hear some muttering across the way in the shadow. There's a faint source of light that looks like a glowing orb that's floating in the air above and giving this faint greenish-white light; a bauble that's giving a light source to whatever this cloaked figure is. You hear the muttering, and two more walk down the staircase to join them. You recognize, from the faint bit of light, a glimmer of metal around the neck of one of them that is the symbol, the hole with the metallic fork. You see Remnants of Vecna.
Sam: Remnants?
Matt: You don't see any faces. You see a glimmer or shine on the metal from the light cast from the bauble.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: What?
Taliesin: This can't be happening right now.
Liam: We don't recognize faces? We don't see faces?
Matt: You see hooded figures that are walking in. There are three of them.
Marisha: Oh, so they're cultists.
Matt: Okay. So which ones are you aiming at? There's three of them.
Laura: I'm aiming at the first one I saw.
Matt: Okay, the first one you saw just stepped out of the center of the hall there, and then the two others walked down the hallway. You're aiming at the one that came out of the side of the wall?
Laura: Has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet?
Matt: There's been discussion over the shoulder. They seem to be aware of each other's presence, but they haven't come together to engage as three in the same area yet.
Liam: I will follow my sister's lead. If she attacks one, I send one to another one and two to the third.
Laura: I'll attack the first so he can take the second.
Liam: One. Two, three.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: These are auto-crits, though, because we are surprising them.
Matt: This is true.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: Yes, you can Hunter's Mark him.
Laura: Oh, so we don't have to roll for attack? It's an auto-crit.
Matt: Well, no, you still have to roll to see if you aim. You have advantage on the attack.
Laura: 27.
Liam: 27 on my first.
Matt: Okay, both hit.
Laura: Second attack. Oh my god, 20. 20 on the second attack.
Matt: Okay, that hits.
Laura: I got a one on both. Thank god they were both at advantage.
Liam: 27. 19, 25.
Matt: Okay, all three hit.
Laura: And they're all critical?
Matt: No, the first one crits.
Liam: Oh, really? Okay. The first is sneak attack.
Matt: They're not all crit. Once you hit the person they are no longer surprised.
Laura: Okay, so the first one is a crit. Solid! That's okay.
Marisha: Yeah, I feel so bad for you.
Liam: You are the most powerful person at this table.
Laura: 14, plus six lightning damage. Oh wait, you know what? Should I single out the lightning damage or say what all the damage is?
Matt: Well, it's an auto-crit, so lightning damage is doubled, as well.
Laura: So it's 12 lightning damage.
Matt: Right, plus whatever your sneak attack damage is.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's happening.
Travis: You already did 40 point of damage without doubling.
Laura: Don't do that.
Sam: Travis, shut up! These two and their gigantic damage rolls.
Taliesin: Huge, mammoth.
Sam: Huge, bulbous.
Taliesin: Turgid.
Laura: I had already rolled that, but it was a six again, so 40, plus 12 lightning damage. On the first.
Matt: 52 points of damage.
Liam: I got 48 on my first, but that's it. 48, done.
Laura: I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage on that first guy.
Matt: This is on the other guy; the second guy.
Laura: Add ten because of Hunter's Mark on the first one.
Marisha: Little bit of that reach around.
Sam: The dice smell a little bit.
Liam: 48. 20, ten.
Matt: So 48 on your critical.
Liam: That's the critical. That's the dice damage. I rolled really low.
Matt: 20, ten. Okay, then. All righty. Are you shooting the same guy, Laura?
Laura: Yes, I was all on one, unless he went down. Would I notice?
Matt: No, he did not go down.
Laura: Okay, then the second one. 21 on the second one.
Matt: That does it.
Travis: How much damage? Total.
Matt: Total on that round from you would have been 110 with the first hit between the two of you on the first guy and the second hit. So the one that was off to the side, who is leaning forward, hunched over, and looking over his shoulder. The first arrow goes into the throat and he reaches for it, and as he does, the dagger (impact) into the face, into the socket where there is no eye, which then looks up with a groan. Finger goes out as soon as the second arrow takes the other eye out, and then falls back down to the ground, dead. Pointing your direction like (gasping). As soon as the two other daggers go into the other two, they both see the one crumple to the ground, the two left there, the guy who is standing at the stairs--
Liam: May I also dump some poison?
Matt: Sure, into which one?
Liam: Into the first one. I did one into my first target and two into the second; the poison would have gone into the second person. It's a DC of 15.
Matt: All righty. DC of 15? Yeah, that succeeds. 16.
Liam: So nothing, right?
Matt: Nothing, yeah.
Liam: Balls!
Matt: As soon as the one crumples to the ground and the two other daggers into the other two that are there, they (grunt). They see the one fall. The one in the center of the chamber glances over his shoulder and says, "It seems I'm the lucky one. Odell, run back and tell that Viskorad found sneaky prey." The one immediately to the left begins to run up the stairs.
Laura: Can I shoot him again before he runs away?
Matt: Nope because you took your turn. This is their reaction.
Sam: Oh shit. You need help, Matt?
Liam: Initiative!
Matt: We're about to roll initiative, motherfuckers.
Laura: Sorry, guys. We did it.
Marisha: Viskon? We've heard the name Viskon before.
Sam: We've also heard the name Odell.
Liam: Yeah, Odell.
Marisha: Odell comma tell Viskon we have visitors. Wait, when did we hear Odell before?
Liam: I just know we've heard it.
Sam: There's been three Jamieson's in our campaign, too. Matt isn't an infinite fount of names.
Matt: Everyone else is still down the stairs right there.
Laura: I wonder if we should have let them talk for a second. Oh, well.
Liam: That's not our way.
Matt: Apparently not, as recent events have shown. So now, I need everyone to roll initiative.
Travis: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Laura: No, it's okay. I've got advantage.
Marisha: Don't let them leave. I agree with that.
Taliesin: Leave one of them alive, but don't let them leave.
Liam: Not good for Pike.
Marisha: Did everyone roll shittily?
Travis: No.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Laura: 23.
Travis: 21.
Liam: Get that long range. Get that runner.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Sam: 18.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: What's up, bro?
Liam: I'm not fast.
Taliesin: 13.
Liam: 13.
Travis: That's weird for you.
Taliesin: It's almost as low as I can go.
Matt: 13 for Pike? No, that's Vax. What's Pike?
Liam: Pike clocked in at four.
Matt: Pike is clocking in as Pike.
Liam: Yeah. Where's the remix of this song?
Taliesin: I know. (beatboxes)
Matt: All righty, so beginning of the round. Vex, you're up first.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine around here, so he can lash up and try to catch that wizard, the cloaked guy that's running away.
Matt: What's he have to roll for that?
Laura: He has to roll a dexterity save above 15.
Marisha: Get it! Get it, son!
Matt: That's an eight. He is running up the stairs.
Laura: So it snatches his ankle.
Matt: And then drags him.
Laura: Backwards. Then I'm going to shoot him twice.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Not that one. That one looks like he knows too much.
Laura: What is that? 32.
Matt: 32, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 14, plus four lightning damage. I don't get sneak attack on this guy, though?
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay. 14, plus four lightning damage, and then I'm going to hit him again. That is also a 32. No, that's-- well, it's very high. 27? 28
Matt: 28. All right, that hits. Roll damage. Grog, you're up next. You're in the back of the marching order.
Travis: We're not up at the top, are we?
Matt: No. So you've got at least 25, 30 feet before you can get to the top there.
Laura: 12, plus six lightning damage.
Matt: Nice. All right, 36 points of damage in one round. The arrows (impact) as he is pulled through the rock and rubble by the Grasping Vine that is currently wrapped around him.
Laura: I am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Grog, you're up.
Travis: As I hear the sweet melodical Miami Vice tunes of warfare being played, can I double dash up past my mates and into the fray?
Matt: Sure, so at 30 feet, it'll get you right at the edge of the stairs. Still have 20 more feet you can go.
Travis: Yeah, straight towards them.
Matt: All right, so that's there.
Travis: Then can I use dash to go the rest of the way?
Matt: To close the gap there? Sure.
Travis: Now, I only have my bonus action left, so can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may, yeah. All righty, so at that point you go into a rage.
Travis: That's my turn.
Matt: All righty, so now it is his turn.
Marisha: You have that guy? But this guy was the runner, I thought.
Taliesin: Yeah, but he's vined.
Marisha: Okay. He's currently grasped.
Matt: Okay, as soon as you rush up into his face, you hear the individual, the hood pulled back at this point. You see shaved entirely bald, older, late fifties to early sixties, missing one eye, but in that socket you can see a faint spark of arcane energy. Shouting out amongst the space, "Glory and reward is mine! Wraiths, go forth and devour, while I bring oblivion to them." As you rush up, is going to cast Wall of Force right in the space between there.
Marisha: Between him and Grog?
Laura: (singing) The space between.
Sam: (singing) Your wicked lies.
Matt: It pushes you back five feet, and now there is a Wall of Force that is blocking that side of the hallway from where he is.
Marisha: Him and the other guy? Or just between him? How big is it?
Matt: Sorry, the entirety of this chamber is the Wall of Force.
Marisha: Fucking fuckface.
Travis: What does Wall of Force do? Can I walk through that shit?
Marisha: Yeah, it just might hurt.
Travis: Will it?
Matt: As soon as the wall appears there, you see a slight short barrier that forces you back about five feet. You catch your back foot, and now as the barrier finishes shimmering, it's invisible. Looks like there's nothing there. He's grinning from there. He glances over to the right into the hole in the wall where his friend was earlier.
Travis: Which was that way, right?
Matt: As he glances over, he goes, "Odell, bring me the sphere." You hear the humming noise, the faint humming vibrational noise, now louder. That ends his turn. Actually, he is going to take a step back up onto the stairs there. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up? What can I do?
Matt: You're 20 feet down from the staircase.
Sam: My speed is 25.
Matt: That'll get you right up to about there, with five-foot steps.
Marisha: Don't let them leave!
Sam: Oh god, this looks like a crazy thing.
Travis: (counting) 60 is how far away he is.
Sam: Wow. There's a Wall of Force. Do I see a Wall of Force?
Matt: You don't. You actually rush up, and it looks like it's an open hallway right now.
Sam: Okay. I see Grog in attack mode, right? I see these two bad guys. I will send a Lightning Bolt at somebody.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: Looks like I can't see this guy because there is a pillar in between, so the other guy.
Matt: That's true, so it'll be that guy. All right. You'll have to move off to the side, or else you're going to hit Grog with the Lightning Bolt. It's going to be hard. He's up a few steps, though. You could probably aim it above and hit him without Grog. I'll let you do that. As you get to the top, you release your bolt of lightning. (crackling noise) It arcs forward, and as it gets right above Grog, it hits something solid and splinters. No effect.
Liam: So this Wall of Force visually is floor to ceiling?
Matt: You don't know; you don't see it. He saw a faint shimmer because something pushed him out of this space, but right now you have no visual perspective. That's going to end Scanlan's turn, I believe. All right. The other guy, who is currently held by the vine that falls limp off of his body--
Laura: It falls limp off of his body?
Matt: Well, it doesn't wrap around or keep him held. Every turn, it can pull something towards it. He's going to glance over towards the side, listening to what the other, Viskorad, said. Okay. At which point, that humming gets louder and louder.
Taliesin: He had the map. If he built the map, there's a way out.
Matt: You watch as a two-foot-wide black sphere of void-like nothingness comes carving through the stone wall immediately to the left of you, Grog, leaving a completely disintegrated form roughly the shape of its sphere. It's coasting in towards and into your space.
Travis: It's a Sphere of Annihilation.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: Oh shit, son!
Laura: Oh god!
Sam: Is someone controlling it?
Matt: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Oh my god, roll so well! Do you get advantage?
Travis: I do. I have Danger Sense. It fucks you up. Yeah, it hurts real bad.
Sam: I see this happening, right?
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You manage to duck out of the way as it enters the space, and you can feel this weird energy. Your beard is almost being pulled toward it, and the loud vibrating (vibration) hum before you. It's like staring into an absolute nothingness.
Travis: Take my life, but not my beard.
Marisha: Who looks like he's controlling it? Odell?
Matt: The guy who is being pulled by her is concentrating and moving it over, at that point.
Laura: Oh, the guy in red? The guy in red is controlling it!
Matt: All right. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: (yells)
Matt: I've got to rest for a second. Controlling enemies hurt. It's okay.
Sam: We can get dudes behind you to hold you up.
Matt: We'll see how I can do it. Keyleth, your turn.
Marisha: Oh my god. So much has changed from what I thought I was going to do.
Matt: You're about 25 feet down the staircase.
Marisha: Yeah. So I come up from the staircase.
Matt: Okay. That gets you up to the edge there, where the staircase stops.
Travis: Does the Sphere of Annihilation get an attack of opportunity if I run away?
Taliesin: Probably not.
Sam: Is it a thing? Is it a weapon?
Matt: It's a black sphere of void. One of the guys is looking focused, concentrating on it, and it moved under his willpower in the direction of Grog.
Travis: It's real bad.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to come up. I'm trying to think of what I have in range, and I'm terrified. And I'm going to stick with my original instinct and do Wall of Stone and try and wall these guys in so they can't run. I think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now.
Travis: They can, but at least they'll be here.
Taliesin: They'll have to move the orb to do that.
Marisha: Okay. I can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot panels, so I want to be a semicircle block off, bring up a whole wall of stone behind them.
Matt: Okay. Hold on a second.
Travis: Who can get to the other side? You have Dimension Door. But that's it, right? That's the only person that has that kind of a thing.
Matt: As you attempt to concentrate and create a Wall of Stone, you are unable to pick a point or an area beyond the barrier.
Travis: The Wall of Force? No!
Laura: Say it again?
Travis: And you need to focus, or is it a random?
Matt: It doesn't fizzle the spell. You have no area to release it on. The barrier, while invisible, is preventing targeting a specific area to create.
Taliesin: We need to dispel this shit.
Marisha: I do have Dispel Magic.
Matt: You've used your action to attempt it. You didn't lose the spell slot, but you spent your action attempting it.
Travis: Hey, man. That was a nice try.
Marisha: Can't cast through it.
Laura: Good to know. But the orb went through it?
Matt: No, the orb is on the other side.
Marisha: Even though it's a nature thing, going up underneath there, I can't get around it? No?
Matt: You're targeting on the other side of the wall. It has to be in visual range for you to create it to happen.
Marisha: (singing) I'll see you on the other side of the wall. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That's Keyleth's turn. No, sorry. At the end of Keyleth's turn, you hear this (breathy noise) sound as these two shadowy figures emerge from the nearby walls.
Liam: Ghosts! Shadows!
Travis: No. What? Ghosts or wraiths?
Marisha: Wraiths.
Liam: There's ten different kinds of things like that.
Marisha: Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth?
Taliesin: Oh shit, and look what they're doing!
Matt: This one hovers over and lands behind Keyleth. And it's going to attempt, as it seems to shift through the pillar--
Marisha: I look over my shoulder and go  Oh no!
Matt: This one here stays within the pillar, and it reaches out, as it's incorporeal, and strikes at you. That is 24 against you, Vex.
Laura: That hits.
Matt: All right. You suffer 21 points of necrotic damage, and I need you to succeed on a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Fuck! Come on.
Travis: My fucking god!
Sam: It's a 20? (screaming)
Matt: All right. Well, you suffer the 21 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 21.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: Until you finish a long rest. The other one's striking at you, Keyleth. That is a 16.
Marisha: Misses!
Matt: That's right, because your AC is 17 with the ring.
Marisha: That's right! I leveled up, motherfuckers!
Matt: All right. Cool. Technically, leveling up didn't affect your AC; however, calculating the magic item did.
Marisha: But I feated, so I'm good!
Matt: I know. So as it swings toward you, its claw streaks out and has no effect. And then they both vanish. You want to take an attack of opportunity? You can if you'd like to.
Marisha: War Caster?
Matt: War Caster. You can attempt to cast a spell on it as a reaction, if you'd like. This one's going to back away into the wall, as well. Vex, you also get an attack of opportunity if you'd like, with a melee weapon.
Marisha: Does it have to be a bonus action?
Matt: No, it can be an action. That's part of the War Caster feat.
Laura: I have a dagger, but I don't even have it drawn.
Matt: Then yeah, you're fine.
Liam: They're both out of visual range, right?
Matt: They both are now backing up.
Liam: One's in a pillar, and one went through a wall. Are they moaning and shit, in the wall?
Matt: You can't hear them.
Liam: I can't hear them. Can't see them, can't hear them. All right. Thanks.
Matt: No worries.
Laura: I have resistance to necrotic damage, by the way.
Matt: You do! Then you take ten points of necrotic damage, and your hit points are only reduced by ten.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now.
Taliesin: I have no ideas for anything.
Marisha: I have never done this before, but I have it learned. I will Ice Knife it in its face. Ice Knife! Level one, you create a shard of ice, fling it at-- oh, it's a flingy-thingy. But it's 1d10 piercing damage, and then it explodes?
Matt: Okay. It's right next to you. She has the feat where she can cast the spell as a reaction when something comes at her. Just know that whatever you're hitting is right next to you. So if it explodes, does any radial damage, it might come back and hit you.
Marisha: No, hit or miss, the shard then explodes, the target and each creature within five feet of the point where the ice explodes. Oh. I'm fine. I'm doing it anyway.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll to hit.
Travis: And Scanlan's in five feet of her?
Laura: No, he's behind her.
Taliesin: Oh, for fuck sake.
Marisha: What's wrong with us?
Laura: Wasted all of our 20s on goods.
Matt: Tonight is ridiculous.
Marisha: One.
Matt: All right, so as you release the Ice Knife, it slams into the wall. No effect. However, it does still explode, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So it does what damage?
Marisha: 2d6.
Matt: 2d6 damage. So go ahead and roll 2d6. To both you and the creature?
Taliesin: Yeah, all creatures within range.
Marisha: Technically, reroll ones. Three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, each creature. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes.
Matt: All right, so you take seven points of ice damage, and it hits the wraith. However, the cold damage doesn't seem to have as much of an effect as you would expect.
Laura: It's a fucking wraith!
Matt: That ends their turn. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: I hear a whole bunch of commotion, so I'm going to pop my head up out of the hole and see what the fuck is going on.
Matt: All right. You glance up and get just beyond where Keyleth is, pushing past. You have five more feet you can move if you want.
Taliesin: Well, I'm coming up the hole. I take a look. Oh, sweet god. I'm going to take a shot at the guy I see up on the table there.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's better.
Matt: Which guy?
Taliesin: Yeah, the gray. And that's 28?
Matt: Okay. (gunshot) You fire a shot and watch as it detonates against some sort of invisible wall that you didn't see was there before, scattering helplessly against the space in the air.
Marisha: I hate this force field shit.
Travis: It explodes near my head, and I'm like Stop shooting into this thing!
Taliesin: I'm going to drop back down the hall.
Matt: All right, you get right back down to right there. That ends your turn, Percy? Vax, you're up.
Liam: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to dance through to here, where I can see Grog and these guys, and I can see all my friends here, and I'm going to hold my action to attack anyone who comes right up to one of my friends within striking range.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Perfect. Ending Vax's turn, Pike's up.
Laura: Pike comes running up the steps.
Matt: She can get right up to here, and that's as much as she can move. She can still cast a spell if she wants to. She's going to cast Beacon of Hope for all of the allies within range, which is 30 feet.
Matt: All right, so that is everybody but Grog.
Laura: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: That's my fault.
Laura: That gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and any time you're healed, you regain the maximum number of hit points.
Sam: Even if we move out of the radius?
Matt: It affects everybody at that moment, and then you carry it with you.
Laura: Wisdom and death saving throws.
Liam: You got glitter-bombed with holy goodness.
Marisha: Wisdom and death plus what?
Laura: And full hit points when you get healed.
Taliesin: You don't roll; you get the max.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Matt: Okay. So ending Pike's turn brings us to the top. Vex, your turn.
Laura: Oh, great. Well, I've seen all the things explode. Fucking hell. I'm going to pull out my Vecna symbol, that necklace that we still had, and put it around my neck, because that fucking sphere is out and I don't know if it matters.
Matt: Okay, so you quickly throw it around your neck.
Laura: Do I still have control of the vine?
Matt: Currently, yeah.
Laura: Okay. And it's on the other side of the force?
Matt: This is true.
Laura: So I'm going to use it and I'm going to try to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is holding the force wall, right? But it probably is a concentration. The guy in red is holding the sphere.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: The guy in red is holding the sphere. I'm going to try to knock him down and see if I can break his hold on the sphere, maybe? Is that stupid?
Matt: He does not make his save. He isn't moved. It wraps around him and pulls him tight against the area where it is again, but it's barely shifted him, so he gets moved a few inches, but doesn't seem to affect him at all.
Laura: That's a bonus action. I still get an action.
Matt: Yep, and movement.
Laura: And movement. Oh god. I'm going to spread out. I'm going to come over here, maybe? Or here. Oh jeez. I don't know. I can't hit anybody! I'm going to wait. I'm going to hold my action until I see something getting through that fucking force wall.
Taliesin: Until there's something to hit.
Laura: So that I can attack him.
Matt: Sounds good. All right, Vex, that's the end of your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'm going to try and run through the Wall of Force. It's only five feet of my movement, and we'll see what happens.
Matt: All right, you slam face-first into a stone wall. Immediately, the anger fills through you, the familiar smell and taste of iron-like blood as you seem to have busted some element of your nose in the impact.
Travis: Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere? Not even an inch?
Matt: No.
Travis: What if I channel all the rage from my life, and I draw on the undead? Okay, cool. I'm going to turn around and run the other way.
Marisha: You didn't get through?
Travis: No, it didn't even give, apparently. (counting) 50, right there.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, that ends my turn.
Matt: This guy turns around and begins to make his way up the stairs and move double dash, and disappears up the stairs.
Marisha: (screams in frustration)
Travis: We can't do anything. Nobody knows Disintegrate or anything?
Marisha: Whose turn is it?
Matt: That finishes that guy's turn. It is now Scanlan's turn.
Sam: I'm going to take a few steps forward. I will inspire Grog, I guess.
Travis: Or yourself.
Sam: I'm okay.
Travis: Really? Okay.
Sam: I'll sing to him. (singing) Don't mess with that big black ball, it can really fuck you up. I really hate that big black ball, all it better do is miss you, make it miss you.
Matt: Oh my god, that was not my intent in creating this encounter. Take your d12 inspiration die.
Travis: Thank you.
Sam: And I guess I'll Dimension Door, try to go through the Wall of Force. We've tried this before, Matt. Who knows how this shit works?
Travis: And the previous ruling was it worked.
Sam: Yeah, but that could have been a gentle nod.
Matt: The wording is important on this.
Liam: I think the cultist shits his pants and his brain explodes. I think that's in the book.
Matt: I've had to look this up very carefully. With elements like this wall, it's a targeting thing. You cannot target something that is in full cover, total cover, which being behind a wall is. Teleportation, however, you're the target and Dimension Door and Teleport is unaffected by that.
Sam: Matt fucking hates this.
Marisha: Get the runner!
Sam: I don't know where the runner went.
Marisha: He went that way.
Sam: I don't see him, right?
Matt: You saw him run away, you just don't know where he is at the moment.
Sam: Can I gauge roughly how far he went down that hall? Do I see down the hall?
Matt: Not from where you were over there.
Sam: So I'm going next to the red guy.
Liam: Also, if you get out of range of Vex, Vecna knows all.
Laura: Oh yeah. Stay within 60 feet.
Matt: All right, so you Dimension Door there. That's your action.
Sam: That's my everything.
Marisha: We've got to take out these guys' eyeballs.
Matt: That's the end of your turn. At which point, Odell, who's standing there currently, is physically sweating, concentrating on this sphere right now. Looks over and sees you appear and goes, "Viskorad, the little one made it through!"
Sam: Who are you calling little?
Matt: At which point, you glance over your shoulder and you can see that the darting, cloaked one stops and spins and faces towards you.
Sam: That's not good for me, guys.
Marisha: It's not good for you, but it's good for us. Fuck them up!
Travis: Oh god.
Matt: That's as far as they can get. However, it completely disintegrates the central pillar. It is obliterated, like it lays with a top part and a bottom part, but wherever the sphere passes through, about a good six inches around it is turned to dust and is gone.
Laura: Oh my god, what if we fail these rolls?
Matt: He's then going to go back around--
Taliesin: No, he's grappled.
Liam: No, he's grappled.
Matt: No, it doesn't grapple. It just moves things toward it.
Marisha: You're confusing Entanglement with Grasping Vine. Two totally different things.
Matt: He's backing up, and he's looking over at the sphere, concentrating on it. You can see the beads of sweat pouring down his face, and he's glancing over nervously at you, but smiling at the idea that his friend is returning. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Seeing Grog slam into that. Ugh, fuck. This is a pretty beefy spell, yeah? Force Wall? Should I do fifth or sixth level to dispel this? Okay. Fifth or sixth level? Sixth level. I'm going to Dispel Magic this wall.
Matt: Okay. As you focus and concentrate, you release the essence of the Dispel Magic, the burst of arcane energy casts forth, and falls harmlessly against the exterior.
Laura: It's a higher level.
Liam: It's a higher level.
Marisha: Higher than sixth level? The spell.
Matt: Didn't appear to have an effect on the wall.
Travis: Come on, maybe it needed to be something else.
Liam: No. He did what Scanlan does with Counterspell. He beefed it up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You can move.
Marisha: It's higher than seventh level? Did you have to roll?
Matt: No effect on it.
Taliesin: Okay, it's going to be okay. Everything's okay.
Liam: So about that long rest...
Marisha: I don't know now, you guys.
Laura: We're fucked.
Marisha: I move forward. I guess. I don't want to move that far forward. No, I don't move that far forward! (laughter)
Marisha: I don't want to die!
Matt: That finishes your turn, Keyleth?
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Marisha: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Laura: Oh no, here they come.
Taliesin: Oh no, here they come.
Matt: They take minor damage being in the physical wall, but that's fine with them.
Liam: Boom, I attack! Sneak attack on the one near Keyleth.
Matt: Emerge. All right, so the one near Keyleth. Go for it.
Laura: What was I holding for? I was holding until I could attack something, or until I could get through the wall? I think it was through the wall.
Matt: The wall.
Liam: All right, 27 on that guy.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. So that is three, plus three is six, so ten. (counting)
Taliesin: If we can hit them, they're probably squishy.
Matt: You took out one of three between just two of your surprise attacks.
Liam: 34 for the first hit, and I have the second paladin attack, so if it's not dead, I will attack again.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That is eight for the second.
Matt: As it emerges from the wall, its blackened shadow form giving off small tendrils of dark black ether and abyssal energy, it reaches out to strike at Keyleth, and you immediately release two daggers in its direction. Both hit its form. It gives this pained sucking sound as you watch its beady, burning red eyes seem to blink in the pain, and it angrily lashes out at Keyleth, its form somewhat more disparate and unable to maintain a corporeal form.
Liam: When is Pike? Is it her turn? No? Okay.
Matt: No, she cast Beacon of Hope. So attacking against Pike. That is 21. What's her AC?
Laura: 23!
Matt: 23. It tries to strike at her, and she manages to take the shield and bash it away. The light from her mace arcing around causes it to flinch, and it actually strikes a little too wide. The one that's arcing towards you, Keyleth, that is fucking 16 again! Yeah, because it's plus six to hit. Okay. You dodge out of the way a second time. It's then going to move back into the wall over here. He's going to move back into the wall, as well. Both of you get reactions.
Laura: Pike definitely takes it. With her Mace of Disruption, she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage.
Matt: All right, so roll an attack on that one.
Laura: That's a 21 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I am wickedly out of my element. I'm running from an 8-ball.
Taliesin: We've got to get everyone away from that thing.
Laura: 27 for Pike.
Matt: 27 points of damage?
Laura: Is it a fiend or an undead? So it has to have a wisdom save of 15.
Matt: If it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, which it does not. That one has not taken a whole bunch of damage. However, it did take a relatively decent hit, and you watch as she swings the mace out. As it pulls back, where the mace impacts, it seems to almost evaporate part of the shadowed form, and it shrieks as it disappears into the wall.
Liam: For clarification, that is the one I hit, as well, right?
Matt: No, the one that you hit is where she was.
Liam: Oh, Pike hit the other one.
Matt: Correct. Keyleth, are you doing anything as a reaction?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to pull out my staff and do a Burning Hands on him. Dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Natural 20, so it takes half damage.
Marisha: Half damage.
Laura: Ooh, that's good. You did the six and the four.
Taliesin: And then there was a third one.
Marisha: And then there's a third one that is a six? Was that right? Six and six is 12, so 16.
Matt: 16 points of fire damage reduced by half which is eight, and even that impact seems to be lessened by the wraith-like being seemingly absorbing some of the heat from the impact.
Laura: Radiant damage is the bomb!
Taliesin: Radiant damage is what we need in here.
Matt: All righty, that ends their turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to stay in my little cubby hole. I've got some good visual on a couple of these guys down here. I'm going to yell at everybody to get the fuck away from the ball. I'm going to hold my attack until something happens that's going to give me something to shoot at.
Matt: Okay, so as soon as an enemy reveals itself that you can shoot. Okay, that ends Percy's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Fucking hell. I'm going to do the same thing except I'm going to move to here and wait for something to attack one of my friends.
Taliesin: That's awfully close to the ball.
Liam: I know it is. That's what I do. I'm waiting until one of them attacks one of my friends. One of the undead. I can't do anything about that. That's what I'm doing. That's my turn.
Matt: All right, Pike's turn.
Liam: Stupid, I know. That's what Vax does.
Laura: I can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up, right? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon. Should she do it at a second level? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like it's on fire.
Matt: Whereabouts? On the wall here?
Laura: No, near the wall, yeah. Up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing is down. And then she's going to hold her physical action until there's something that she can attack.
Matt: Okay, she's holding her physical attack?
Laura: Yeah, her mace.
Matt: Okay, that ends Pikes turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, that's me!
Matt: Yeah, that's you, actually.
Liam: You're Vex.
Laura: I'm Vex. I'm going to dart away from this ball as fast as I can, and I'm going to come up here.
Sam: Hey, you broke through!
Laura: I broke through the wall. I can't reach. I'm too fucking-- It's fine; I got it.
Sam: Make Matt stand up, Laura.
Matt: Please do. I appreciate it.
Laura: And I'm going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that I can attack.
Matt: Okay. All righty.
Marisha: I can't believe I couldn't fucking dispel that wall.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah, I am, aren't I? Okay. Cool.
Laura: Wait, I have bonus action still.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to use that Grasping Vine that I still have up, and I'm going to re-grab onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him towards the wall he's right in front of.
Matt: That's a 15. What's your DC on that?
Laura: 15.
Matt: He succeeds, unfortunately. It slaps out towards him and this time-- I forget the adage, but never mind. He dodges it. (laughter)
Liam: It took 425 hours, but we did it. We broke his brain.
Matt: Blame it on the painkillers. The vine whooshes out and tries to wrap around him. He dodges out of the way, and it slaps harmlessly against the stone and withdraws back into the small crack of stone where it's based. That ends your turn. All right, Grog.
Travis: I'm going to put my faith in Scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens. (counting) 30. Right up against the wall. Can I look to the left down that hallway? Can I see down there at all? Is it blocking the hallway off from vision? Is that a moveable space?
Matt: Looking off, it looks like the orb was being used to carve a path.
Travis: It hadn't finished doing it?
Matt: No. It was maybe 25 or so feet down and was hitting solid rock.
Laura: My spell DC may be higher. I don't know if I have increased that in a while.
Liam: It's eight, plus proficiency bonus, plus her spell bonus.
Laura: So my spell DC is 17.
Matt: You need to keep up on that, girl.
Marisha: That was how I lost to Grog in our battle.
Laura: I wanted it around his neck, just to make him annoyed.
Matt: It hits him against the wall. He's still glancing over his shoulder.
Taliesin: He's lost visual range of the ball?
Matt: No, he can still look over the rubble there.
Travis: Not enough to make a concentration check?
Matt: If that's what it does.
Travis: I'm there. I can't get into that hole anymore, can I?
Matt: Not with the way the Wall of Force is placed, no.
Travis: Fair enough. I will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance.
Matt: Okay, ending Grog's turn. At the top of the staircase--
Laura: Oh no! He's coming back for Scanlan!
Matt: This guy here, we'll say he got about that far from the stairs and continues that way.
Marisha: Sanctuary!
Taliesin: Like he's parting the Red Sea.
Taliesin: You shall not pass!
Marisha: You shall not pass!
Laura: Oh my god, we're going against Gandalf right now, you guys.
Taliesin: That's not Gandalf. That's a cosplayer.
Liam: Do you know many hobbits I have under my cloak?
Taliesin: Five hobbits in a cloak. That's all it is. It's not a wizard.
Matt: He glances down at the staircase where you are, and as he begins to smile, the flash in the eye begins to glow briefly, a pale comparison to Vecna, but there is an essence of energy lent to him from his worship of the newly risen deity. He begins to speak in a language you don't understand. And as he speaks one alien word-- how many hit points do you have?
Sam: A lot. 167.
Matt: Fuck, okay. I miscalculated. No effect.
Sam: Power Word?
Matt: Power Word  Stun. He assumed the smaller stature of the gnome was not as hearty.
Travis: He's upset that he miscalculated. The DM wants blood!
Liam: That's what he gets for profiling.
Matt: He's going to continue moving upward, 30 feet back up into the staircase as he keeps focusing on you. That's going to end his turn. You're up, Scanlan.
Sam: Hold on. I need to look up the range of a fucking spell. How far is he from me?
Matt: It's hard to tell at this point. You'd say somewhere between 50, 60, 70 feet.
Liam: I bet your spell is 120 feet, Sam.
Sam: I'm looking. That one's not.
Liam: Is it Thaumaturgy? Because that's right where your eyes are.
Sam: You said how far? Oh shit.
Matt: Between 50 and 70 feet from you.
Laura: You can move.
Liam: You can move.
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to move 25 feet towards him.
Matt: Okay, so that puts you up here.
Sam: And with my darkvision, do I get a sense for how far he is from me now?
Matt: Yeah, you'd say he's about 40 feet from you.
Sam: Fuck no, it's not. Shit, I need 30.
Laura: You can move five more feet. You've got more movement.
Sam: No. That's my movement. I have tiny little nubs.
Travis: Tiny little nubs?
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: What about long-range shit, man?
Sam: That's okay. Yeah, I've got longer-range shit, but it's not as bad news.
Marisha: Keep them from running away.
Travis: Damn it, Matt. Why'd you have to back up?
Matt: Because that tactically made sense.
Liam: Bigby's Hand him? Grab him?
Sam: I'm thinking. I'm trying to decide between two things.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on, let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel the love.
Marisha: This is all on you, man. This is all on you.
Travis: Do your thing. Listen, Shadow of War comes out October 10th. A lot of us are in it.
Sam: It's going to have a lot of wisdom. All right. I will Bigby's Hand. I assume he's got a lot of wisdom, so I will Bigby's Hand him. At level seven. And I will punch the shit out of him.
Laura: Punch him back toward us. Bigby's Hand on the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us.
Marisha: That's a good call.
Matt: All right, so that is 8d8 force damage if you hit. Roll a melee spell attack.
Laura: Inspire yourself!
Taliesin: Inspire yourself!
Sam: I didn't. I forgot. I rolled an 18.
Matt: 18 hits. He's a caster; he doesn't have a lot of armor.
Marisha: Kill him!
Matt: All right, so roll 8d8 force damage.
Taliesin: I have three.
Sam: And I've got one.
Liam: That's just some dude from Sea Org in a bathrobe. Punch him!
Taliesin: Wow, that was a deep cut.
Sam: Wait. Shit. What did I just roll? 16 plus four. That's 20. And then this is another-- 40.
Matt: 40 points of force damage.
Sam: 40 points of force damage.
Matt: All right, that's a 20 DC concentration check.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Come on.
Matt: 16. No.
All: Wall down!
Laura: Did we notice? Did we notice that the wall went down?
Matt: No, you don't see it.
Sam: I don't know. Right?
Matt: But Grog would feel it. Grog is sitting there waiting for something, as Bigby's Hand full-on sucker punches him in the body, and he slams against the steps and has to shake his head as he glances at the giant fist and down at you.
Sam: As a bonus action, can I do anything?
Matt: If you want to do a bonus action, you can't do Bigby's Hand again.
Sam: No, but can I throw something to see if it goes through the wall?
Matt: Sure. I'll let you do that. Roll an attack roll, just to aim it.
Sam: Sure. 17, plus I don't know.
Matt: What are you throwing?
Sam: Scanlan found these two really crappy daggers in the desk in the casino.
Matt: He pulls one of these jeweled daggers that he wore and throws it behind, and Grog, you watch as this dagger passes through.
Taliesin: I see that, and I take three shots at this fucker up here immediately. How far away is he?
Matt: Which guy? The who Bigby's Hand just punched? Okay, he is about 120 feet.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Bad News, then, because that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle. He's going to take that.
Laura: I'm going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me.
Taliesin: I can't use a bonus action, and I have to reload once, so I can only take two shots with my action. I can't take three. So two shots with Bad News. Here we go. That's a 25 and 27 to hit.
Matt: Both hit.
Taliesin: First shot is 22 points of damage. Second shot is not as good. 14 points of damage.
Matt: So as you fire those two shots, the echoing noise of Bad News's explosions echoes through the hallway and stairway above. Vex.
Laura: I'm going to sharpshooter him, the guy right in front of me.
Taliesin: There's a lot of noises going on in this place. I think it'll be okay.
Marisha: Oh, it's fine. There are tunnels collapsing and shit. It's fine. I'm not concerned about the noise at the moment.
Laura: 22 to hit?
Matt: 22 does hit.
Laura: 21 damage on the first. And then 19 on the second. That's also Sharpshooter.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: No, that's 19 to hit.
Matt: Gotcha. That hits.
Laura: 27 on the second.
Matt: All right, nice. The guy who's controlling the sphere, after the first arrow strikes him right in the chest, he looks and starts to run up the stairway, and as it does, you take aim with your second arrow and release it, and it hits the base of the skull. You watch him go down one of the stairs.
Taliesin: So the sphere is still there?
Matt: The sphere is still there.
Laura: But he doesn't have control over it anymore. This guy in red is down, so all that's left is the guy and the wraiths?
Taliesin: Was there a third guy?
Laura: We killed him. That was the first guy we killed.
Matt: That finishes Scanlan's turn, right?
Laura: Yeah, that was your turn.
Sam: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Okay. I run up as far as I can, 30 feet. Do I see this motherfucker?
Matt: Yeah, you see him. You have a 60-foot range of darkvision?
Marisha: Or I see the glimmering of Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you could probably see him okay. A little bit. It's very dark, but barely.
Marisha: Fireball! (laughter)
Taliesin: That's an answer.
Matt: As you rush up, from the edge of the staff, a bead of red light engulfs the hallway above in flames. You see a split second of him and Bigby's Hand's outlines before fire engulfs the space. Go ahead and roll damage on that. That's a natural 20 on his save, so he gets half damage.
Marisha: What the fuckballs?
Matt: I didn't even roll with advantage on that one.
Sam: You said Fireball on this guy? Bigby's Hand takes damage.
Marisha: Does he? Magical?
Sam: Yeah, he has hit points.
Taliesin: He could roll a save, though.
Sam: He could!
Matt: Let's check. Yep, it has no bonus, so you roll a d20 and see what you get.
Sam: 11.
Marisha: 29 points of damage.
Sam: It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points.
Matt: Yeah, it has your hit points.
Laura: That's amazing!
Sam: Yeah, it's me.
Matt: That ends Keyleth's turn. He's still alive. This one's going to move through the hallway here.
Marisha: He's still going after my ass?
Matt: This one's going after Pike.
Liam: I get to attack. I've been holding.
Laura: Pike gets to attack. Pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could, too.
Matt: So Pike gets her attack, and so do you.
Laura: So 20 to hit on Pike.
Matt: 20 to hit? That hits.
Laura: Where is my other d8? Here it is. (counting)
Liam: When you hold, does bonus action carry over?
Matt: Nope, just the action.
Laura: So it's 22.
Matt: 22. All right. And what's the saving throw?
Laura: Saving throw is 15.
Matt: 15. Four, no. As it comes out of the wall reaching for Pike, she swings wide with the mace. As it slams into it, there's a flash of divine energy. Her eyes seem to pulse with a matching burst of radiant power, and as it hits, the creature squeals and squeaks as the light from the mace actually dashes it from this existence or any other. That is scattered into nothing from the shadows.
Liam: I rolled an 18 and a one.
Matt: 18 hits. One misses.
Liam: Okay, so sneak attack. One.
Sam: One misses?
Laura: I know, right?
Liam: 39 for the second attack.
Matt: 39 for the second attack. All righty. And with that, as this one reaches out towards Keyleth, your dagger strikes the back of its body, and as it impacts, you watch as its shadowed form turns into nothing but a splash of dark, half-existing ether, which then fades as your dagger clatters to the ground motionless.
Liam: Back to the belt.
Matt: All right. Percival, you're up.
Laura: Kill him!
Taliesin: Reload. Going to take another shot.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Going to take a shot. Yeah, let's take another shot. Probably got a low AC. Let's make this a sharpshooter, just for fun. Yeah. That's a sharpshooter shot, so that's a 24 to hit?
Matt: 24 hits.
Taliesin: All right. So let's do (counting) 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 points of damage. (gunshot) The echo of the impact as you watch part of the lower jaw and throat of the cultist in the robe gets blown apart. He stumbles back onto the steps that he had barely started to get up off to and you watch and you hear the horrible coughing sound as his last moments of life are robbed of it as it tries to get back up and then stumbles right back and bleeds out against the steps.
Taliesin: We can still interrogate him. He doesn't have to be alive for that. Any other problems?
Liam: How's the ball doing?
Matt: It's hovering there in the center of the hall.
Laura: We can't do anything about that floating ball. Cover it with a handkerchief.
Marisha: You beat me to it, man.
Taliesin: Let's rifle through these guys' stuff. Which one do we want to interrogate?
Marisha: Keyleth goes up to the red robe.
Taliesin: Let's throw gray robe into the annihilation ball. Let's get rid of him.
Travis: Vax. Why don't you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming? Keep watch.
Laura: But stay within 60 feet. Everybody gather up around me again.
Liam: Sis, come up to where Scanlan is so I can go a little further ahead.
Matt: Everyone is barely still within 60 feet.
Taliesin: Everyone gather up. We're going to get our stuff.
Laura: Avoid the ball.
Marisha: Vax, can I borrow a dagger?
Liam: Yeah. I give her Whisper.
Marisha: I take it and I stab it in his other eye. Red robe guy.
Matt: Okay. (splat) Other eye is destroyed.
Sam: I'm going to use Bigby's Hand to grab the sphere.
Matt: Do you? Okay. Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs towards the sphere, and as Bigby's form attempts to grasp the chaotic point of destructive energy, Bigby's Hand suffers 26 points of force damage and is forced to pull back.
Sam: That's not so bad.
Matt: But cannot grasp it. Cannot move it. (electrical shock)
Laura: I'm going to rifle through the robes of red robe.
Taliesin: I'm going to get Odell.
Matt: That's the one she's rifling through.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. There was a third guy, right, that they killed early on?
Matt: Oh, the first guy. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.
Taliesin: Assume we're going through everybody and taking their shit.
Liam: I'm standing as far from Vex as I can, but I can't go much farther because obviously-- yeah.
Matt: Okay. Interestingly enough, based on the current scenario and what preparation has been, no money on them. They have no worldly possessions that are what you consider of use. They each carry a gnarled wooden wand that they've been using as a focus for their spellcasting. Beyond that, they have nothing on them except for the one that you shot has, you notice the left hand is withered and gray, the skin is pulled taut against the bone. But beyond that, there is no other possessions on them, beyond the symbol of Vecna they wear around their throat.
Marisha: How many of those symbols do we still have, and how many robes do we still have?
Laura: Well, we can grab their robes, I don't know how many of those we have, but I think we also have a necklace.
Liam: Also, we can have Pickle talk to one of these arseholes.
Taliesin: I think that's a good idea.
Marisha: The guy that I'm standing over, red robe, I'm going to rip his necklace off.
Matt: Okay. You tear it off.
Laura: I'm going to take his robes.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, we're taking all this shit.
Matt: So you take every set of robes. And these robes are different from the robes that you had seen in Thar Amphala before. These appear to be a little more ornate. They seem to have a little higher station, which is why it's interesting that beyond the robes and some basic undergarments and the wand, they have nothing on them. They are a sheer conduit of their own power.
Taliesin: Were they drilling? I want to take a little bit of an inspection. Were they drilling with this thing? Is that why they had it?
Matt: Looking around the pathway, you can see that a lot of the staircase probably was more caved in, but has been cleared out by the movement of this orb. It's being used as a form of excavation tool as they push deeper into the catacombs here.
Marisha: So they were holding on to that orb the whole time.
Laura: Yeah, the guy in the red was controlling it.
Marisha: Yeah. He didn't cast it, though. We didn't see him cast that.
Laura: It came out of the wall.
Matt: Yeah, it came out of that little gap on the side there.
Sam: I'm going to go over to the sphere and say to it: I command thee to respect my authority and obey me as your new master.
Matt: Are you trying to exert your will on the sphere?
Sam: I'm intimidating the sphere.
Matt: Make an intelligence arcana check.
Sam: Intelligence arcana check?
Matt: Just an arcana check.
Sam: Oh! 19.
Matt: 19? And you're standing right next to the sphere to push your will into it?
Sam: Yeah, I came closer to it.
Matt: Okay. As you stand there, you focus on the orb, and you can feel your will push past the event horizon of the sphere. However, the force is too strong inside, and as you pull out of it instinctually, it moves towards you. (screaming)
Taliesin: Why did you have to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature?
Matt: Yeah. Ten feet. Which is right where you are, so I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Matthew McConaughey is going to reach out of it for you.
Sam: That's not good. 11.
Matt: 11?
Sam: Bigby, save me!
Matt: The orb pulls back and slams into the edge of his gnomish face and chest, and you watch as his flesh is pulled towards and disintegrated at the exterior of the sphere.
Laura: Can we reach down and grab him away from it?
Marisha: Yeah, Grasping Vine!
Matt: You take 30 points of force damage, and it's currently now right in your square, right up against you.
Laura: I use my Grasping Vine and I yank him away from it.
Marisha: Yeah, move away!
Matt: Okay. So you all push him out of the way and the vine pulls him.
Travis: Two-Face!
Matt: Yeah, you look a little rough.
Laura: Scanlan, you're hideous now.
Sam: Don't look at me! I'm fine.
Travis: Some other voice starts coming out of him.
Sam: I think I can take this thing.
Liam: "So did you want me to talk to one of these guys?"
Matt: You got the sense that there is a way to exert your will over it the way these guys did, but in that moment, your will faltered, and you didn't quite understand the nature of the sphere.
Sam: I just need to try again harder.
Marisha: Wait!
Laura: You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you give yourself inspiration?
Sam: This is an ability check, right?
Matt: This is an ability check, yes.
Taliesin: Wait, was that a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: No. It was an arcana check.
Travis: It might be high, dude. You might have to roll a 30.
Taliesin: Let's leave it. Tend to the sick and leave the well alone.
Travis: Indiana? Let it go.
Laura: Or Dominate that shit.
Sam: I'll try one more time.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: All right. Let's all back up.
Laura: I get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him.
Matt: Okay. And everyone else backs up a little.
Marisha: Keyleth stares with a vague familiarity.
Sam: I'm going to inspire myself.
Matt: Okay. So make your roll first, as you begin to focus and exert your will towards it. You add it on to it.
Sam: Pretty good.
Laura: Now inspire!
Sam: And inspire?
Matt: Up to you.
Sam: Okay. Plus my what? Arcana?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ooh, that's a lot. 30.
Matt: Okay. As you this time begin to push your will towards the sphere, you push past the event horizon, your consciousness connects with some--
Sam: (garbled) Listen to me, damn it! Respect my authority!
Matt: Some ancient space of the void within this blackened circle. As it connects-- What's your intelligence modifier?
Sam: Plus three.
Matt: Okay. What are you trying to will it to do?
Sam: I'm trying to will it to-- Shit, it's just a big black ball. Slam straight into the ceiling!
Matt: It moves up ten feet and then it hits, devours the stone above it to create this small tunnel right directly above.
Laura: Oh my god! You did it.
Sam: We can use it!
Taliesin: Finally.
Sam: Have you guys seen The Explorers?
Taliesin: I'm in The Explorers, motherfucker. I'm in The Explorers.
Sam: You are?! That's one of my favorite movies of all time! Can I get your autograph?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: Were you kidding? Are you really in The Explorers?
Taliesin: Yes! I'm really in The Explorers.
Liam: Stop the game!
Taliesin: I'm one of River's little brothers. I'm Ludwig.
Sam: Oh, wow!
Marisha: Yeah, he knew River through that.
Laura: What if we use the orb and go straight up? We don't even keep tunneling, we juat go straight up to the city.
Sam: It only listens to me.
Laura: Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or anything?
Sam: No, this is a cool thing.
Travis: Yeah, but it only makes a hole its size. It's two feet across.
Taliesin: I think he's not ready to pop a wheelie on this thing yet.
Travis: Plus, remember the guy was concentrating super hard, so it's the only thing Scanlan will probably be able to do.
Marisha: But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are The Champions?
Sam: Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't! We'll never make it! Yes, we can!
Liam: All I'm thinking is I could come up and do Lay on Hands and heals, but I'm like, you made your bed, lie in it.
Taliesin: Yeah, no. I'm okay with this.
Laura: What do you think? Do you want to go up?
Sam: We're still investigating these guys and stuff.
Marisha: Fuck these guys! We got all their shit. Let's go!
Sam: I'm going to call this ball Simon 3.
Travis: Do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement?
Matt: You watched him push it, and it went about 15 feet.
Travis: The sphere can only move 15 feet.
Sam: It will slow us down.
Matt: It's a very slow-moving ball of destruction.
Taliesin: Bring the sphere back down so that we can throw their bodies into the sphere so that they don't turn into undead fuckwads.
Liam: Wait a second, though! God, I don't know what this will do. I have a spell called Zone of Truth.
Laura: So it forces them to speak the truth? Does it work on undead?
Liam: A creature that enters the spell's area for the first time. If it fails.
Laura: So you could cast it, and then Pike could cast Speak with Dead, and it would come up into the Zone of Truth.
Liam: That's right.
Travis: No, they have to tell the truth when you do Speak with Dead.
Liam: No, they don't.
Matt: They don't have to.
Marisha: They can lie.
Taliesin: Here's a weird question  what saving throw do they have to make to speak the truth?
Liam: An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. So it could avoid the questions.
Laura: But they have to answer the questions.
Liam: But they have to answer the questions because of the other spell.
Laura: Right?
Sam: Double mumbo-jumbo?
Matt: It can't tell a lie, as you're discussing this. Technically, a creature would be unable to lie in the area.
Liam: Unable to lie, and with Pike's spell--
Laura: They have to answer the question.
Liam: They have to answer the question.
Matt: Let me double-check for you.
Taliesin: And what's the save?
Liam: Charisma saving throw against my spell save DC, which is not huge.
Marisha: What is it?
Liam: 16.
Matt: I mean, it does have to answer.
Liam: I like it.
Taliesin: Are we going to try this crazy shit?
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: Might as well. Okay, hang on, though! What are we going to get from this guy?
Laura: Find out how close we are to Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah, what's the plan? What are they trying to do?
Liam: What has Vecna got cooking?
Taliesin: What's Vecna planning? How many of them are there?
Marisha: I'm going to go pee, you guys.
Liam: He might not know everything. How long does it take for Keyleth to pee?
Laura: No, but how close we are to Vasselheim? What's the plan of attack in Vasselheim? How big is his army? We get five questions, I think, with Speak with Dead.
Taliesin: Five?
Sam: How close are we? What's his plan? Where is he?
Laura: Where is Vecna within the city?
Sam: Who's with him?
Laura: Who's the death knight?
Taliesin: He might not know that. But what are they excavating for? What are they looking for?
Travis: I think I know that.
Taliesin: I think I know, too, but I want to hear him say it. It'd make me feel better.
Laura: Let's do it! Cast your Zone, yo!
Taliesin: Get in the zone.
Laura: (singing) Autozone!
Matt: (chuckling) Autozone of Truth?
Liam: Shit. So can anyone drag him down on his roll to save, or boost me?
Taliesin: No. Not me.
Laura: I don't think so.
Liam: Does anyone have a cantrip? Okay. All right. Let's do it.
Matt: All right. So which one?
Liam: Well, first Zone of Truth, then Pike.
Matt: Okay. So you create the Zone of Truth, you create the area, the radial space where the divine energy kicks in and the compulsion to not lie remains within. And then Pike--
Laura: Casts Speak with Dead.
Matt: On which corpse? There are three corpses.
Liam: Red robe seemed more fancy.
Sam: Who seemed more senior?
Liam: Red robe did.
Matt: There are three, technically.
Sam: There was the guy they killed right when they burst on the scene.
Taliesin: We'll take the fanciest cloak.
Matt: Okay. It's relative, but the guy who was controlling the sphere seemed to be at least different.
Laura: He had a different color. Yeah, red robe.
Matt: All right. So as Pike takes the time to focus and recite the incantation, she grabs her holy symbol and focuses and speaks aloud the words in Celestial of the blessing of Sarenrae. And as she completes the ritual, she suddenly screams out in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her knees. No effect. And she suffers--
Laura: Oh no! What did he do to Pike?
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: On 6d6, I rolled four sixes and a five. That's 31 points of psychic damage to Pike.
Liam: She tried to cast Speak with Dead Dumbfuck.
Matt: She's shaking and grabbing her face and rubbing her eyes, and it takes her a moment to come back to you and she looks around, and you can see a faint bit of blood slightly dripping out of the corner of her eyes. She's like, "All I heard was laughter."
Sam: Laughter?
Laura: And you said it was minus 36 damage?
Matt: 31.
Liam: Vecna is in these motherfuckers' brains.
Marisha: Everyone looks upset.
Laura: Pike got psychic damage from that dude.
Marisha: How much? A lot?
Laura: 31 points of psychic damage.
Marisha: Oh, that's a lot, yeah.
Taliesin: Burn the bodies. Fuck it.
Marisha: Throw them down the well.
Taliesin: Throw them into the sphere.
Marisha: Oh yeah!
Sam: Sphere! Do your worst.
Matt: One by one, you grab and take the corpses and thrust them towards the sphere, as they immediately crumple, fold and get pulled in, turned to nothingness, disappearing into the black void. There are elements of the way the sphere acts and manipulates things that remind you of the siphons, though differently. It's more violent in some ways, and it is its own contained magical entity. With each body, it vanishes in the sphere, and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath and deciding the next order of business in traversing the insides of this titan. And that's where we'll end tonight's game, because it's 11:30.
Marisha: I feel like I always come back from the bathroom right as we're ending games.
Sam: First of all, it's so great to be back!
Taliesin: It's so nice to be back.
Sam: Matt, thank god you're totally 100 percent healed and all better again.
Matt: It's great. Sorry. But yeah, missed you guys. We'll be back next week, pick up from here, see as the final charge gets closer and closer. What will you guys do next time? In the meantime, rest well, don't forget, if you can, to give to the Red Cross to help support the victims of recent hurricane battering in the US.
Laura: Look for Shadow of War.
Matt: Shadow of War coming out on October 10th.
Marisha: Our comic on Wednesday.
Matt: Yep, look for that. And we'll see you guys soon. Have a wonderful week, we love you, and: Is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]
