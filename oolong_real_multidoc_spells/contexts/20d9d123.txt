[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Everyone, welcome to the new episode of Critical Role. This evening, we luckily have Ashley Johnson back in as her character Pike. Unfortunately, Laura Bailey will be gone for most of the game, possibly, she might come in, 'cause she's busy recording a show with Wil Wheaton. It's gonna be a great show, but we'll miss her, until she shows up. However, we shall see what the next chapter has in store in just a moment. In the meantime, let's go ahead and get you situated with the character backgrounds.
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size. This barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (giggles), shiny things. But also ale. In his early years, armed with his two handed gray axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned, and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches. Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder clap) Under that unintimidating, petite frame is a vicious beast, waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants. Literally. (giggles) Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation, and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. Anyways. It wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities, and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped, and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stilben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise, and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest, and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river, and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well gird your loins ladies because he has his eyes on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troop, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter a distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts, and makes the females swoon. (sputtering)
Orion: Greetings, and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Tirex, located in the heart of Draconia. Born from a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the sorcerer's right, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges in the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps, of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learn of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse, and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands, in that respect. But it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that! (sputtering) I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy go lucky, and, well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax’ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capitol of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capitol didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night, and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journey back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax’ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (drawing blades) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax’ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance. And after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of a thief. While Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt, and to track, to spy, and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen trinket-- to fight along side her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable. And gives expert massages.
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this Barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (giggles), shiny things. But also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the wood--
Matt: Welcome back. Unfortunately, we don't have Pike's video ready yet. I'm working on it.
Ashley: My bad.
Matt: This week got away from me, and Ashley got it to me a little late, but we'll have it up next week, don't worry. However we are happy to have Ashley with us. (all cheer) She's come down from her BAFTA cloud. (all laugh) Which is amazing, congratulations again.
Ashley: Thank you guys.
Matt: So yeah, as a heads up too, if you wanna do any quick announcements real fast, I think you had an announcement you wanted to make.
Ashley: It's my mom's birthday today. (all cheer)
Matt: Happy birthday Ashley's mom, yay!
Ashley: Her name's Nancy.
Liam: Hi Nancy.
Travis: Happy birthday, Nancy. Totally watching this right now.
Marisha: Is she watching?
Ashley: She probably is. (all laugh)
Matt: Well, hello! Also for those who are Hearthstone players, the new Black Hawk Mountain Expansion came out today, in which I voice Nefarian and Ragnaros. (all cheer) My vanilla-WoW-playing self from back in the day is nerding out over that, so enjoy that. Anyone have anything else they wanna announce or talk about? Are we good to start?
Sam: Hi, mom!
Marisha: Hi, mom.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: I don't think my mom knows what the internet is.
Orion: Related, I leveled my undead holy priest to 64 last night, on Warcraft.
Zac: We're just about a thousand happy--
Matt: Congrats. Way to go, level 64. So you're just barely into burning crusade, good man. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I got one too. My brother who also works in video games gave a talk at GVC this year, and it just went online, and not now but later you should watch Alex Jaffe's talk on metagame balancing. It's really really fun, it's fabulous, and you learn a lot.
Matt: There you go, Alex Jaffe, look it up.
Marisha: Alex is brilliant.
Matt: All right guys, so, getting to the game at hand. So little overview for the story, the party has been sent to the city of Kraghammer, through a friend of theirs named Arcanist Allura Vysoren. A good friend of hers and a folk hero throughout the land known as Lady Kima of Vord, who's the halfling paladin of Bahamut, has gone missing. She went on a vision quest as part of a pilgrimage she's been on for the past year, and sensed a dark evil brewing far beneath the city of Kraghammer. Disappeared into the city and hasn't been seen for weeks. So Arcanist Allura asked the party, hired them essentially, to go and see her whereabouts. Upon getting to Kraghammer, they interacted with some of the local characters, eventually found theirself talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who owns the mines at the very bottom of Kraghammer proper. After a brief encounter with a mutated abomination of a Naga creature, they were then hired by lord Nostoc to go into the mines, find whatever's creating these abominations, destroy whatever is the source of them, and he will pay well and also pay for each creature head that is brought to him individually. After getting into the mines, a few battles ensue with some of the local denizens, couple of the umber hulks, that were turned into snails, and other interesting circumstances. The party then found what looked to be an entirely abandoned goblin city, and a series of goblinoid corpses, many of which had bored holes in their skull in various states of decay. They found a long bridge across an open chasm. Upon traversing it, Scanlan went invisible, and found what looked like a duergar war camp, which are like ashy-skinned, evil dwarves that live deep underground. Watched a dwarf get executed by what appeared to be some sort of strange alienoid creature, that was revealed to be an illithid, or a mind flayer. A being that is psychic and consumes brains.
Ashley: Brains!
Matt: Upon returning, the party had a plan to lead them off of a illusionary cliff, that went pretty well. Ended up taking out a significant portion of the charging army at the time. Vax here, however, got stunned on the way across by the one mind flayer, nearly fell, however was saved by Tiberius at the last moment. Nearly lost their magic carpet, but it was retrieved.
Ashley: Wait, you still have the magic carpet, right?
Matt: Yeah, it got recovered. Barely.
Marisha: We got it back, it's okay.
Travis: Not thanks to some.
Matt: (laughs) After brief discussion, Keyleth and Vex decided they didn't want to listen to anyone's bullshit, and hijacked magic carpet, flew down into the chasm below, and discovered behind one of the underground waterfalls some sort of a mind flayer who was cast out from the society, covered in rags, kind of a twisted physical form, and after a very tense discussion seemed to befriend it under the guise of mutually agreed retribution against those that are oppressive to this whole chasm area.
Marisha: Clarence.
Liam: Clarota.
Sam: Clarota.
Matt: Clarota. I don't think he'll take kindly to Clarence. However, this is where we left off the previous game.
Ashley: So nervous.
Matt: As you guys have gathered up, and you've finished your luxurious song to try and ease his torn form, he finishes tapping his toe in spite of himself. Looks about the rest of the group and says, once again, not vocally, but speaking directly into your mind, through a horrifying whispered voice that you cannot even close your ears to get rid of, "I think it's best we rest out of sight." He points across the chasm, to the war camp that is looming across the way. He begins to dart off towards the abandoned goblinoid village.
Orion: I guess we should follow him, then.
Sam: Yes, that's wise.
Taliesin: I think that's a great idea.
Sam: We follow.
Taliesin: No, nothing can be there.
Matt: As you guys make your way in toward the goblinoid village, you can see Clarota who is genuinely hovering about a foot off the ground, and kind of just coasting around in a very creepy way. Finds one tent, opens up and looks inside, "Here, here we can talk." Darts inside.
Travis: We follow.
Sam: We do follow, yes.
Matt: As you're following--
Travis: Oh crap.
Sam: Oh God, we're dead.
Travis: Why? Why would he touch his dice? We're gonna die!
Matt: As you're following towards the center of this town, you, see in the distance, a small light moving, back from the direction where you first saw that duergar camp, where Grog was assaulted.
Travis: I don't recall that.
Liam: Look back the way we came, there's some sort of light up ahead.
Orion: That can't be good.
Liam: Stay with Clarota, I'm gonna go take a look, Scanlan, come on.
Sam: I'm coming with.
Matt: Both of you guys roll stealth.
Travis: I'll stay outside the tent if somebody wants to ask him how to get a Magneto helmet like his. (all laugh) 'Cause I'm gonna need that.
Orion: I'll talk to him.
Sam: It's just a roll? Not great. Nine!
Liam: 29.
Taliesin: That's a number.
Matt: So, as you officially vanish into the ether and surrounding darkness, Scanlan, who still has that song stuck in his head from earlier, his slow jam is just... (laughs) Abstractedly humming to himself without realizing, and calling a little bit of attention, at which point you began to hear some footsteps in the distance that come to an immediate halt.
Liam: Grab Scanlan, put my hand over his mouth, and say, Quiet, man, what's wrong with you?
Sam: It's a nervous habit! I'm sorry! (all laugh)
Liam: With great power comes great responsibility, shut up!
Sam: It's a gift I have to share with the world!
Liam: Later, later. Save it for the mind flayer. So with him tucked under my arm like a football, I start to creep further. And try to make out-- if there's light from the lantern, I can see in dim light, thanks to daddy's blood, so. I'm gonna try to figure out what it is exactly that I'm seeing.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: I also have low light vision.
Matt: You can make perception check with disadvantage, because you're under his arm.
Liam: Perception check? Oh.
Sam: Nope.
Liam: Do I have any advantage on that?
Matt: No.
Liam: 11.
Matt: All right. Actually, directly looking in the direction of that duergar camp earlier, you can see behind a pillar that's blocking your view, it's obstructing your view of the actual camp proper, you can see some movement in the light. You hear some shuffling, it sounds like plate. You hear a voice just kind of muttering to itself. A familiar, female gnomish voice.
Liam: Pike?
Ashley: Hey guys! (all laugh)
Ashley: It's me, Pike!
Liam: Jeez, where have you been?
Ashley: Oh man, I've had quite a time. I've missed you guys terribly. A lot has happened. I'm sure for you guys as well.
Sam: Not so much.
Orion: I say into my thing, "Scanlan, what the hell's going on?"
Sam: Don't worry, it's a friend, we'll bring her back soon.
Orion: Okay, well, there's a mind flayer here.
Sam: Keep him busy. He likes slow jams.
Orion: Right, right.
Matt: As you guys take a look at Pike, you notice she's fully armored, but dirty, she's got sweat across her face, looks like she may have had a couple scuffles on the way through here.
Ashley: I did.
Matt: She's got a wild look to her eyes.
Sam: Oh my God.
Matt: Genuinely relieved to see you. Pike, you've managed to come down here through the front of the mines, which for the most part have been clear. You follow what details you can after asking around and discovering that the rest of your party had ventured below without you. You've followed the tracks best you can, and are glad that you at least chose the right path and ran into them before you ran into something far more dangerous. What you were inspecting was this campsite that appeared to have been abandoned. What caught your eye was against the stone wall right above the ring of stones that form the fire itself, there is a giant symbol carved into the stone that is a protective sigil of Bahamut, the platinum dragon, which is a religious symbol of protection, used in different divine rituals.
Liam: We were looking at that, we couldn't make heads or tails of it. You ever seen that before?
Ashley: No. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and make a religion check.
Liam: Are you sure? Think about it, just for a moment longer.
Ashley: Well give me, actually, let me rethink on this. I think maybe--
Marisha: So wait, are we all reunited?
Liam: Oh, it's a natural 20!
Marisha: Oh, welcome back Pike!
Travis: The first roll.
Marisha: Are we all reunited?
Liam: You just forgot.
Ashley: I just-- you know what? Actually, now that I'm thinking about it. (all laugh)
Matt: You clutch your holy symbol instinctually as you reach up and run your fingers along the stonework, tracing the carving across the stone. As you do, your eyes close, and you feel the warmth of Sarenrae's presence fill your mind for a second, and for a split moment, you can see a well-armored, very driven, female halfling with hair pulled back into tight brown braids, a dark green cloak thrown over one shoulder, who's currently carving that symbol into the stone. You're seeing Lady Kima of Vord, the one who left this symbol, to protect her campsite as she made up camp here. You don't know how long ago this transpired, but this was definitely left by her in this tunnel.
Liam: What is it?
Ashley: It was left by a woman.
Sam: Lady Kima, the one we're trying to find?
Ashley: Yes, Lady Kima.
Liam: How did you know that?
Sam: Me and Pike are like--
Travis: Oh, Jesus.
Sam: It's so great to see you, you look fantastic by the way.
Ashley: I don't feel fantastic.
Sam: Bring it in, bring it in, give me a hug. Ooh, you smell a little. I like it though. Somehow it works on you.
Liam: We're in a very complicated situation, a lot has happened to us. We found sort of a war camp down here, and there is sort of a being, I don't know what to call it. He's got a little of this going on, and he speaks and lashes out through his mind. We fought a huge force down here, and then we ended up falling into a cavern, and then Keyleth and my sister found another one, what are they called? They're called-- illithids.
Sam: Yes, yes. And we found a rogue one, and we may team up with him-- or her?-- to go back and get revenge and maybe kick some ass in the camp.
Liam: This just happened. He seems extremely dangerous, however, the forces we faced in the other illithid seem maybe worse. So that's where we're at.
Sam: So welcome back. Great, sounds like a fun time.
Sam: Let's rejoin our friends, shall we?
Ashley: Let's go kick some ass.
Sam: So we trot back over to the dead goblin village.
Matt: All right, you make your way back to the tent that was originally scouted out. The rest of the party's there waiting as Clarota is awkwardly sitting in the far end, just looking out as all of you slowly approach and enter the tent. Not speaking, just reactionary, and keeping a watch on all of you.
Orion: I turn to Clarota, I'm like, "Ooh, that's our friend, Pike. She's a good ally. Hello, Pike!"
Ashley: Hello everybody.
All: (gasp) Pike!
Orion: Sometimes we hug as allies, Clarota.
Marisha: Where have you been? ASHLEY Well, I had quite a time. When we were up on the tower, I noticed something, and I felt... I had to leave, because I started to have a vision.
Orion: Oh, those are fun.
Ashley: I feel like I should talk to you guys about this later, just because--
Sam: It's personal?
Ashley: What is your name? I'm so sorry. I'm Pike, it's very nice to meet you.
Matt: You get a better look as you approach this entity. You see what looks like a very tall, thin, gaunt-looking humanoid with a hood over the head as you approach. You get a better look at the facial features. Smooth, kind of dull, bluish-purple skin. These sunken, creepy, yellowish green eyes, and instead of where a mouth or nose would be, you see four slightly twitching tentacles. Barely obscuring what looks like a round lamprey-like toothed maw.
Liam: Pike, this is Clarota. We've just met.
Ashley: Can I shake his hand?
Matt: Do you wanna reach your hand out?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: There is no physical response, the hand is not extended, but you hear, in the middle of your mind, at full volume, a creepy whispered voice go, "Are you to be one of our allies as well?"
Ashley: Yes. Of course.
Matt: "Very well, she may stay."
Orion: Thank you very much, Clarota.
Ashley: I take my hand and scratch the back of my head. (all laugh)
Marisha: I take Pike and I kind of pull her out of the tent really quick, and I'm like--
Sam: Girl talk.
Marisha: Okay he's like a mind flayer, and we found him in a hole under a waterfall, but he's cool, but he wants vengeance.
Ashley: Is that-- the thing is covering, so he can't be--
Marisha: He's like outcast, yeah. But he's gonna help us fight all of his tribe who hates us.
Liam: Clarota.
Ashley: Do we know for sure he's helping us?
Orion: Yes.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: Can you help us understand your kind? Your history? How you've come to be here and who this individual is that is fucking with your shit? (all laugh)
Matt: Proverbial statement, I like that. At which point Clarota's eyes narrow, and you can feel just the general mood and energy of the inside of the tent grows dark. It grows mildly tense. Suddenly you feel this presence, a voice once again, fill your mind as Clarota says, "Seven years since I discovered my curse. My form was struck with the brand of the Arcane. And these foul arts proved difficult to conceal. My brethren could sense my impurity, my deviation, and cast me out. I was severed from the Elder Brain. And chased on threat of death, should I return. I wandered these tunnels in squalor, feeding on what paltry filth I could ensnare, and fleeing from the ones I could not face alone. In my wandering, I discovered a duergar stronghold, with a magma pool, and it proved to be a decent source of sustenance for some time. Paying off the occasional straggler. Suddenly a great battle took place. It appeared something had sieged the stronghold. Reading the surface thoughts of the deep dwarves I encountered in the following weeks, I found a shift of power. Whatever had taken this hold had now demanded fealty of them. And they accepted when faced with annihilation. This entity that took the duergar by force, they called K'varn. I caught no sight of it. But the fear I could sense, from within these doors were so primal, so great, that I knew to keep a distance to be safe. But four months ago one of my estranged people, was captured by these ash-skins, and brought within the obsidian walls, for what I assumed was interrogation. Long after, the bulk of the Duergar people marched in packs through the long, deep tunnels that led to my people's colony and attacked. Strangely, before much bloodshed could occur, which I only assume was the next step in this onslaught, the fighting stopped. And the colony allowed the ash skins to waltz directly into the temple, unharmed, unchallenged, where our Elder Brain resides. It wasn't until after I discovered whoever this K'varn is, they themselves infiltrated the temple, and somehow took the Elder Brain under their own control. I watched as my people had their will robbed of them. And they took the will of all the others that lived and breathed in these tunnels. Now, a terrible army is forged of both factions. And they walk under the banner of this K'varn. Since this, I've fled back to the higher tunnels, and scrounged for materials so I could shield myself from the iron grip influence of the now enslaved Elder Brain. It took me weeks. But I'm confident I'm safe from its influence. For now."
Taliesin: Is that the thing that you wear upon your head?
Matt: As it pulls the hood back, you see once again this kind of haphazard, metallic cluster of patches of metal, and iron, this dull kind of blue metallish glow, that you can only now see once he's sitting in near pitch darkness. As he reaches up and runs his finger along it, "Yes. This I feel can protect me. But I think... I think there is a way to change the tides of this circumstance, I feel that if I could somehow free my people from the influence of K'varn, release its hold on the hive mind, my people would allow me to rejoin the colony. To be one again with my family. My brethren."
Liam: I have a few questions. Is that all right?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: You and your brethren, without this, do you think as one?
Matt: "We think as individuals, but the hive mind connects us all. The hive mind gives us knowledge, history, direction. It is the source of our family."
Liam: So, one individual of your family sees something, the entire hive sees the same, is that correct?
Matt: "Yes."
Orion: Oh dear, that's no good. (all laugh)
Liam: And you mentioned the Arcane being a stigma upon you?
Matt: At which point it turns its gaze away, and slinks down into its form slightly.
Liam: What do your brethren put their faith in, if not the Arcane?
Matt: "They put their faith in the arts of the mind. Both understanding, manipulating, controlling, and devouring."
Orion: Clarota, we've already allied ourselves with you, as we've already agreed.
Matt: "You'll help me free my people? To be family again, to belong."
Orion: As we said, yes. But the thing you wear on your head, it would make us all the more equipped to take on this task. It's against such powerful mind creatures, such as yourself, I know my way around a couple Arcane things, but nothing of the mind control sorts. If someone like me were to be influenced, it would be very bad for our group. Even yourself, perhaps. It would do well to at least maybe show us how you built it, and-- You get what I'm getting at, right?
Travis: I would like a steel beanie as well.
Ashley: Basically, where do we get one of those?
Matt: "It would take weeks to build another."
Travis: Weeks?
Taliesin: I would like to take a look into it if possible, and see if it makes sense. I am a builder.
Marisha: Maybe we can figure out something a little bit more jerryrigged.
Taliesin: If we were all hidden, we would have a distinct advantage.
Travis: I have a very large bronze pot in the bag of holding. Could I wear that on me noggin?
Taliesin: If you like.
Matt: It gives you a look in response and says, "This protects me from the influence of the hive mind, my preexisting connection."
Taliesin: Could we be hidden from them? Would there be a way to cloak ourselves from their understanding?
Matt: "Stay hidden from the others. Their sight is the mind's sight. The Elder Brain is a collection of the once living mind flayers of my people."
Liam: I have one more question, and we have allied ourselves to you, that's true. But I'm curious to know, hopefully our goals intertwine, and we want the same thing. But once that is achieved, and it will be, what happens then for the Illithid? Do you return to your home below? Do your people harbor any ambition to move upward into Kraghammer?
Matt: It looks to the side and says, "Our ambition is to pursue the continuation of our knowledge-seeking. We have no interest in the surface. We only wish to spread our dominion here below. Expand our great city of Yug'Voril."
Liam: I'm sorry, what was that name?
Matt: "Yug'Voril."
Orion: Sounds like a lovely town, Yug'Voril.
Matt: "It's beautiful."
Taliesin: I feel that we could come to an arrangement.
Liam: I do as well.
Taliesin: We would require of you, at the very least, safe passage once we have helped you reunite with your people, for ourselves, and for a friend of ours who's lost in the darkness, who we are here to retrieve.
Matt: "For this deed, of freeing my people from this insidious presence that is K'varn..."
Taliesin: Freeing all of our people.
Matt: "I believe this could be arranged."
Liam: Scanlan, does he speak true?
Sam: Uh. Let's find out. (all laugh)
Sam: I'm gonna just see if I can detect any lies.
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check.
Sam: What am I adding to this?
Liam: Insight.
Sam: Oh. 13. I'm not an insight person.
Ashley: Oh, can I--
Travis: (scoffs)
Liam: 20 over here!
Taliesin: What are you doing?
Travis: She's rolled twice.
Ashley: Assisting, assisting. (all laugh)
Taliesin: All of your 20's, running out.
Matt: It's too late for the assist, unfortunately, 'cause it's already rolled.
Liam: But can she suss him out?
Matt: Best you can tell, those who are looking into it, he seems to be speaking from a point of desperation, and intent, as he has no other option. He is genuinely-- You can see it in the way he talks, and the way he speaks about his family. He's a little crazy. The isolation has put him to a point where he wants to return to his people, and will do whatever it takes to get back with them, however, he also seems to be, in a weird way that you can read, appreciative that you're willing to help, and seems to be, on his part, genuine. As a note, music's not playing? I don't know if there's a reason for that.
Travis: Did he say his eyes, the flayer's eyes, are what put people in trances, or their minds?
Sam: Yeah, the eyes, the eyes.
Travis: So if we wear helmets, it's not gonna help us.
Sam: No, the helmet is what separates him from his hive mind. It wouldn't help us at all.
Travis: I'll still wear the big bronze pot on my head.
Matt: You put the pot on your head. It's clunky.
Travis: On my whole head.
Matt: You cannot see with the pot on your head.
Travis: No, but I'm protected from the flayer.
Sam: Can you bore two like, ghost holes in?
Travis: I don't need it, I have incredible warrior skills.
Taliesin: Do their powers work with reflection?
Matt: "No, they can peer into your very mind."
Taliesin: But if we approach them using a reflective surface to view them, can they peer into our minds through a reflected surface?
Matt: "If they know you're there, you're in sight, they can read into you."
Travis: Shit.
Marisha: They can read our minds.
Matt: "If you are obscured, unknown to them, then you are hidden. They cannot sense you, but if they know you are there, they can peer, they can pry."
Liam: Is there any way to be hidden for us?
Matt: "Hidden from sight. Be hidden from knowledge. Be hidden from them."
Marisha: Clarence? Sorry, Clarota.
Sam: How about Clay?
Matt: "Clarota!"
Travis: Jesus.
Marisha: Sorry, Clarota. I just have one quick question. Why would you want to rejoin your colony after they've banished you? Why not leave?
Matt: "I have nowhere to go. They are my essence, my connection. I long to return. It is the way of my people, I understand this curse I hold. I spite myself, I look upon this disease, and spit. But perhaps, with this deed, they can overlook it."
Marisha: You're not diseased, you're special.
Travis: Oh, God.
Sam: Question, Clarota.
Matt: "You know nothing of my culture. You presume too much."
Liam: I think we do understand your desires though, and we can align ours with yours. So let us speak of specifics, Clarota.
Sam: Strategy.
Liam: Strategy.
Sam: Number one, that assortment of dwarves and some of your friends and ogres over there on the other side of the chasm. Is that something that we need to face headlong, or can we maybe surpass them, trying to find K'varn, or this temple that you speak of?
Matt: "We may if you wish. Their stronghold is far below. The magma leads the way. However, if I know what I've seen, the general resides in that camp. I know no way within the stronghold, without the brunt of their army. Perhaps the general can be pried for information. If you bring him to me."
Sam: "Bring him," so you won't be accompanying us on any adventure, or...?
Matt: "I will be coming."
Orion: We have to fetch him.
Sam: And the general is in that...
Orion: Where you were, right?
Sam: Yes, yes. So we have to go over.
Ashley: Did you say something about a temple, or did I completely misunderstand?
Matt: "There is a temple in our city. Where my people reside, that is where the Elder Brain sits."
Sam: We'll get there eventually, but first step is this smaller force across the chasm.
Travis: Yeah, we're gonna put the beat down. (all laugh)
Orion: Well said, Grog.
Marisha: You said there was a big army front, guarding this general? Of duergar?
Sam: Well, the general's right across the chasm.
Marisha: Oh, he's just right across the way?
Matt: "Their forces are gathering there. The bulk of their army currently is divided between that and the stronghold below."
Liam: Percy shot this one, I think.
Taliesin: I did.
Liam: I think it's important to point out that your kin, this general, is aware of at least three of us, of my dragonborn friend, the singer over here, and myself.
Sam: I don't think he knows about me.
Travis: No, you were invisible.
Liam: Just us, then.
Orion: I don't even know if he saw me. He saw my funny cards.
Liam: True, it could be just me then.
Orion: Oh, I cast Prestidigitation on Pike and I clean her up real quick.
Liam: You look lovely. How do you think your kin will react to that? What will their response be if they know that outsiders have come? If they've seen just me at this moment, plus a few illusions.
Matt: "They will be prepared. So you must find another way in. You must think how to not be seen."
Travis: Think. (all laugh)
Orion: Don't worry, Grog.
Matt: You've never ever, in your life, ever heard someone else chuckle inside your brain, but you hear within the center of yours: (chuckles) "Think, yes."
Travis: Oh ho, it echoes in the pot. (all laugh) But I start laughing to myself. (silly laughter)
Liam: Can I assume that you would have already given us any advice by now if you knew a way? Are we stuck with our own resources?
Matt: "I've only watched from a distance. Getting too close was too dangerous. I only read surface thoughts. If I were seen, I would be nothing, I would be destroyed."
Liam: So no back doors, no secret entrances that you know of, into the camp, anywhere near this general?
Matt: "None."
Liam: Fuck.
Travis: What's in the bottom of the crevasse?
Sam: It's water and magma.
Travis: Can we pick up the little loch ness monster and throw it at him or something?
Sam: Oh yes, down below, in the waters, our allies - Vex, and uh, somebody. (all laugh) Found some creatures under the water, snatching bodies as they fell. Keyleth. Yes, I forgot who went.
Orion: Her majesty, Keyleth.
Sam: Pike's beauty distracted me, you shouldn't have cleaned her up so nice.
Orion: I'm sorry.
Sam: Anyway, there were some creatures down below in the waters, are those anything that we could use, or should we just avoid them?
Matt: You see it actually hisses for a second, as soon as you mention this he goes, "No, avoid. That creature is older than all of us. It resides there, an ancient mind. One that should be Kept at bay. An aboleth."
Sam: Do you need a lozenge? (all laugh)
Matt: Its eyes narrow once again, not quite understanding the words you use, seemingly amused.
Sam: It's a gnome thing.
Matt: As a brief aside, too, I checked the connection on my iPad, I'm playing music fine, and the connection's in the iPad, I don't quite know where it's losing its connection. But I think we need some music.
Sam: All right, so let's review our options, shall we?
Travis: We're gonna charge in there.
Sam: We can't charge, there's a chasm.
Liam: How did that go with the little brain thing? Not too well.
Taliesin: The chasm is a problem.
Sam: Master switch.
Marisha: An entire colony of mind flayers.
Sam: We could fly in, right?
Liam: The bridge is gone, we have to--
Sam: We can fly in death from above.
Travis: I don't know if I can.
Sam: Well, we can figure out a way. Enough of us can turn into flying things to get you there.
Taliesin: We also have a flying carpet. We can repair the bridge if we had to, at least put a rope across.
Ashley: I think--
Sam: Or we could disguise ourselves somehow.
Ashley: I think I know where we need to go.
Sam: What?
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Really?
Liam: Get out of this city.
Marisha: Please, do tell.
Sam: So, hold on-- (static) (music)
Matt: There we go.
Sam: There's music.
Ashley: Oh wait, I think I read this wrong. (all laugh)
Sam: Pike, don't toy with our emotions.
Travis: You just got back.
Ashley: So you guys haven't gone to the war camp.
Sam: We have.
Ashley: You have.
Sam: We been there and we quickly retreated.
Liam: Scanlan took a poke about. He boofed himself out of sight and had a look around, and then we returned to the edge of it, and I kind of flipped the bird at them, and taunted them a little, but most of us haven't been in.
Ashley: Have you been to the lake?
Travis: None of us went in the water.
Sam: Lake? No, there's no-- what, there's a lake?
Ashley: Isn't that where that thing is?
Travis: The bottom of the crevasse, right?
Liam: Under the bridge, there was--
Sam: No, that's rushing water, that's not--
Matt: The area after the big drop that was at the bottom, there was a lake of water. And there was a waterfall coming out of the natural--
Liam: And the ogres were getting sucked under by something.
Travis: So we didn't go down there.
Marisha: Is there something under the lake?
Ashley: Well I just-- I don't know if I should be talking about this in front of him.
Travis: We could go away from him for a second.
Liam: He will probably hear the thoughts inside your mind.
Orion: Clarota is totally fine to talk in front of. He's amazing.
Ashley: Earmuffs. (all laugh)
Ashley: Well, shall I share a vision I had?
Liam: I think so, Pike. I think at this point, we should just move forward.
Ashley: In this vision that I had, I was pulled down toward the mines. Into the tunnels, below where the dwarves were working.
Marisha: Through the lake?
Ashley: Well, past the goblinoid creatures, and past a great underground lake. Past a jagged onyx colored fortress, framed in molten rock.
Travis: We haven't been there yet.
Ashley: Past a field of broken glass and bone. Have you seen any of this?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No.
Travis: I don't think an onyx fortress.
Orion: Those last things sound terrible.
Liam: Yes, that all sounds shitty. (all laugh)
Liam: The last thing we've seen is the lake, and we didn't go too close to it, because a couple of ogres fell in from above, and they disappeared like something grabbed them.
Travis: We didn't have him fly down there and get a close look.
Liam: No, we haven't had a look around.
Ashley: I wonder if there's like--
Marisha: I can cast Water Breathing on all of us.
Travis: Why don't we send one, like Mars Rover over here, and have him go check it out?
Marisha: I can always turn into, like, a whale.
Liam: Perhaps, but the water breathing sounds good to me. I feel like a head-on--
Travis: Isn't there something in the water?
Liam: -- run into the chasm is a bad idea.
Orion: I pull out my empty bottle, and I go, and I have this!
Liam: Yes, he's got a bottle, plus, we've killed a fucking dragon. I know it's not an easy task to accomplish, but we're pretty badass, I think. We might have a good chance.
Marisha: So wait, is going through the lake gonna get us through to the general?
Liam: Well, we don't know.
Travis: We haven't been down to the water's surface.
Sam: What's the best-case scenario? What, we come up behind them? It's still gonna be a fight.
Travis: But maybe there's a different vantage point.
Sam: We can fly over them, that seems like a pretty good attack point.
Taliesin: Some of us can fly over them.
Marisha: Well we can figure out to where where all of us can fly over them. I'm more concerned about us cloaking ourselves. Even if we're flying they're still going to see us.
Sam: There's an ancient death thing down there.
Travis: He might die, didn't say it was foolproof.
Sam: I don't know, man, he's volunteering you.
Orion: Wait, what's going on?
Liam: I mean, our options are we can vote on it, although we all know Keyleth is just gonna go fucking do whatever she wants. Our options are--
Marisha: That was one time.
Liam: Just the one time.
Marisha: Just one time.
Travis: Never to be forgotten.
Liam: Our options are a headlong advance into the middle of their camp. That's a big fucking force.
Sam: Or some sort of disguise, distraction.
Travis: Tiberius.
Matt: Is the stream down by the way?
Zac: It goes down every two hours and 17 minutes, it's been doing that for-- It comes right back up.
Matt: All right, so let us know when it's back up.
Sam: Two hours and 17 minutes, that sounds like Lost or something.
Travis: Tiberius. Do it.
Marisha: Amityville Twitch stream.
Travis: Go fly all the way down to the water's surface. Like Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future 2, and check out if there's any other tunnels that we haven't seen, or ways to go.
Orion: Isn't this the same water that you bended?
Marisha: I think so.
Travis: We didn't go down to the water's surface though, did we?
Marisha: Well, we went over the top of it, and kind of looked down.
Travis: Oh, we did? We went all the way down?
Marisha: When I was bending the water back, we were kind of in that area, right? That was that area, but the lake--
Sam: Do it smart. Let's go bomb them.
Ashley: What if, I mean--
Travis: Can you freeze it?
Ashley: Do you guys wanna like, put me down on a rope, and I can just run around, see if there's any openings? I mean I have a lot of armor.
Liam: Go fishing with you?
Marisha: Go fishing, yeah.
Ashley: Well no, just like halfway, and then I can run around and look for tunnels. Well some of us can fly, so we're okay.
Marisha: I can attempt to try and drain the lake a little bit.
Liam: And Keyleth said that she can cast Water Breathing, can help us breathe underneath the surface.
Travis: We have two underwater breathing potions.
Marisha: Control Water's a level five spell.
Matt: I realize that. But that's a lot of water.
Travis: But remember, we're slow as balls in water.
Liam: You were having trouble, if I recall, just getting the waterfall out of the way to create, I mean it was amazing, but--
Marisha: I managed to get it stopped--
Liam: I know, you fucking saved the day, but we're talking about--
Marisha: A lake.
Liam: Yeah, Lake Superior.
Sam: This is not just a lake, there is a death monster in there. If we go under the water, we're dead.
Travis: Can we stand on it? Anything, if we wanna fight it? Or are we gonna be fighting it in the water?
Taliesin: Well, we can all have Water Breathing.
Travis: Yeah, but we'll be slow.
Sam: And we'll be underwater, where there's a death monster.
Travis: I'm not worried about that part of the question.
Liam: There's 50 to 100 fucking creeps up top.
Sam: Well, then let's come up with a good plan.
Ashley: Maybe there's hidden stairs or something, like in Indiana Jones?
Travis: Can you electrify the water and fry the guy?
Liam: Hold up, hold up.
Orion: There's only 26 people up there. On our last count.
Taliesin: Before the ones we killed, or after?
Orion: After.
Liam: Those are the ones we saw, though. How do we know how far back the camp goes? How many are in the gate behind it?
Travis: Don't a couple of you have Lightning? Can't you deep-fry the water?
Marisha: I mean, I can make a giant whirlpool.
Liam: Wait a second, wait a second. Clarota, you've been listening to our thoughts for the last ten minutes.
Sam: And what clear thoughts they have been.
Liam: What do you think? What do you think?
Matt: "What resides in that lake is something you wish not to tamper with. An ancient mind."
Travis: Blah blah blah. Hodie-fucking-ho.
Matt: "It clouds the water with its own filth. You find yourself unable to breathe air."
Marisha: Didn't that happen already?
Matt: "Its mind, it takes--"
Liam: Have you seen it?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: It's big?
Matt: "It's rather large."
Ashley: Is it like a many-armed ...situation? (all laugh)
Matt: "One could say, yes."
Ashley: Okay. Swell.
Liam: What's the sitch?
Marisha: So we can face Cthulhu, or little Cthulhu minons, seems to be our choice.
Orion: Clarota.
Travis: Why don't I have Lightning, I swear. Can't you fry the water first? See if it hurts it?
Sam: We can fly overhead and just Lightning the shit out of it.
Travis: Do that, please. 'Cause maybe there's a way-- there's a tunnel, and we come up behind them or whatever it was.
Liam: That illithid took out my brain from like 100 feet.
Sam: You know what-- wait, wait, if I may. When I was there, I saw the main general control all of them instantly, when he was about to make a sacrifice, or feed, or whatever he was doing. No offense. He instantly had all of their command. If we could somehow get to him, and cut off that connection, distract him, influence him somehow to command them to all jump in the lake, for instance. That would get rid of a lot of them all at once.
Liam: Can you make me invisible?
Sam: I can get you there. I can make you unseeable, but not invisible.
Liam: What?
Travis: What's the difference?
Sam: I can make you a fly.
Taliesin: May I examine-- without removing-- may I examine your device?
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Travis: Oh man, Percy, Percy.
Sam: What's he doing?
Orion: He's asking to--
Taliesin: 16.
Liam: What's he doing?
Sam: Touching the hat.
Matt: He glares at you and says, "Our agreement does not include this interaction."
Taliesin: It may be the key to returning you to your people.
Travis: Tiberius.
Orion: Yes?
Travis: Would you go fry the fucking lake?
Taliesin: I won't touch. I will just look.
Orion: I'm reading my book.
Travis: No, I want you to--
Matt: It kind of bows its head, but does not move closer. It just slightly shows you an element of it.
Taliesin: Can I understand how it functions?
Matt: Best you can tell it looks like a skullcap that's been kind of decently made for what it is, but you can see some of the hammer marks on it, or whatever it was put together. It appears to be a very simple piece of metallic material.
Taliesin: So it's magic.
Matt: It looks like it is some sort of enchantment, probably what's causing the effect. It's not any mechanical device that causes it.
Travis: (metal clanging)
Taliesin: So there'd be no way to build something to create a feedback loop?
Marisha: Ooh. I see what you're getting at.
Taliesin: I wanna try and see if there's any way that I can take a look at this and figure out a way to build some sort of feedback system.
Marisha: We need to build a coconut radio.
Sam: We don't even have a laboratory.
Taliesin: He wants a coconut radio.
Orion: I love coconuts.
Matt: You have never interacted with anything psionic-based before. The time to research that, and the materials needed to do it would take months.
Taliesin: Plan two--
Liam: This is a fairly shitty situation.
Travis: While all this is going on!
Taliesin: Because if they can't see, what if we blind them?
Liam: How?
Marisha: With some sort of interference?
Taliesin: With a really bright light.
Orion: Oh, I love doing light things.
Taliesin: What if they are so blind they can't actually see us coming?
Marisha: I believe Pike and I both have access to spells like that.
Sam: I assume that would make us pretty blind as well.
Marisha: Not necessarily.
Ashley: Not if we wear our--
Sam: -- sunglasses? (all laugh)
Taliesin: Can I attempt to build sunglasses?
Sam: Before we build sunglasses--
Matt: You can probably make a couple with the materials you have on hand. You are limited when it comes to resources, as you are currently halfway underground.
Taliesin: Even better.
Travis: Vax could show his ass, that's a pretty white light.
Taliesin: That's as white as it gets.
Liam: It's pale as shit. When I go to the beach, I don't tan, I stroke.
Sam: But I thought we established that they don't need visual contact to influence us, they just need to be able to be aware--
Taliesin: Once they have visual contact they can influence us, but they need to make that visual contact in the first place.
Matt: "The dark, deep dwarves, they hate light. This I know."
Marisha: I think it'll stun them long enough for us to get across.
Taliesin: If we could perhaps put some Light spells on the back and the front of our shields, so that we are guarded from it.
Orion: If you can make a pair for our friend here, that would help him out, I assume.
Marisha: Wait, that's not a bad idea. Pike, can we temporarily enchant the magic carpet as a spotlight as we fly over? As a light death ray?
Liam: We've seen you surrounded in radiant light before, you think you can do that to the carpet?
Ashley: I mean, I have--
Marisha: We should have Daylight. Where's my book? Where's my Player's Handbook?
Liam: And Clarota, while they're figuring that out, if we remain to be hidden or blind our opponents as we approach your kin, will not know our thoughts 'til they see us?
Matt: "Yes. They need to look into you, by knowing you're there."
Liam: Can I fight one of your kin with a blindfold on?
Matt: "Perhaps."
Travis: I thought if they could see you--
Orion: Clarota. The mind hive that you possess, how close can one be before it actually affects? Say 100 feet, caught my friend in mid air, alas, in their run-in. Is its range about--?
Matt: "That's about the distance, yes."
Sam: You may not know the answer to this. I don't doubt your knowledge and wisdom, but I happen to have a ring with mind shielding, will that aid me in any way?
Matt: "It may. If it gives you resistance to psionic influence, it would be of aid, yes."
Marisha: Daylight.
Travis: Do we have a plan?
Liam: It wouldn't be hard to get hold of some pitch down here, some tar.
Sam: To burn?
Liam: No. If you can be invisible, and you have a ring of mind shielding, and you can carry a bucket of pitch to that motherfucker, you can splash it on its face, cover its eyes, and it's helpless.
Taliesin: My God.
Sam: Or I can hang that big brass pot on its head.
Travis: But I'm wearing that.
Liam: Yes, but it could take it off, possibly. If you smear sticky shit on its eyes--
Sam: So wait, I just have to blind it?
Liam: Then it can't control--
Sam: Well, I happen to have a Blindness spell!
Matt: "It may still try, but to be blind, it would be very difficult for it to pry into your mind."
Sam: Could it still control the others, though?
Matt: "Probably. That is a permanent enslavement."
Sam: So you want me to go in there, solo, invisible, and try to blind this thing.
Liam: No, not solo.
Sam: I'm in!
Liam: I like your idea of turning me into a fly. You and I go in--
Taliesin: And we've got Light spells.
Marisha: Pike and I can cast Daylight on our magic carpet.
Ashley: I can cast it onto my shield, and then on the carpet, and we would have a double--
Marisha: I have to take a nap, though. What's that?
Liam: But that could get us in close. Scanlan and I could get in closer, and blind it, and I could stab it in the head.
Marisha: I mean, technically I can also turn into something flying, I could back you guys up, if someone else wants to take the carpet.
Sam: We can all get there. We can all get there.
Marisha: I can cast Daylight on your helmet. On your pot helmet.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: That I'm game with
Marisha: All right.
Travis: I'll be like a lighthouse, walking around. Crushing life. (all laugh)
Matt: You'd be the cover of John Carpenter's "The Thing."
Liam: Did everyone hear Percy, that's a good idea.
Taliesin: Two fronts.
Liam: Yes, two fronts.
Sam: What is it?
Liam: You and I separate from the group, they go in shining like a beacon, you and I (buzzes) in, and while the illithid is focused on them, we go in, you blind him, and I stab him in his maw. It's pretty good.
Sam: That's a suicide mission.
Travis: I like it, let's do it.
Liam: What else are we going to do?
Taliesin: I'm behind this plan.
Sam: Surgical, special ops, seal team six.
Marisha: What does Vax have to say about this?
Liam: Vex, you mean? My sister Vex?
Marisha: Yes, that one.
Liam: That's a good question.
Sam: Oh, Vex, you look so tired.
Matt: Vex, your sister seems genuinely perturbed by the circumstance, but looks to you and says, "Look, I found him, you deal with the situation. Just tell me what to do."
Sam: She's so like that. (all laugh) ASHLEY Let's do it.
Liam: I gave up trying to understand her years ago.
Marisha: Do you know what time it is? I'm feeling a bit nappy.
Orion: Your hair looks fine.
Liam: Well, I--
Sam: Wait-- (shushes)
Matt: "If you need rest, then rest. Time of day has no bearing down here."
Marisha: I have to rest so I can-- I'm gonna read up on this Daylight spell, so that you and me can both cast it. ASHLEY Yeah, we'll just take a nap and just get, you know, rest our muscles, and get ready for the fight.
Travis: I'm gonna read up on this Chopping Head spell. Yep, I'm read up.
Sam: I'm gonna sing a little song to inspire a couple of my allies here, if I can.
Matt: Okay, I would recommend doing it after rest. The dice would go away while they rest.
Sam: Okay, forget it.
Marisha: I go ahead and I light an incense in our teepee, and I make some flowers grow. That's better. That's nice.
Taliesin: I'm gonna do a little bit of work on that first trick arrow. On the trap arrow. Since I've got a little time.
Matt: Go ahead and make a roll.
Taliesin: That's a-- What am I rolling?
Matt: Your engineering-- your tinker's kit.
Taliesin: Oh, it's just an intelligence roll, right?
Matt: Plus your tinker's kit proficiency. It's down underneath your skills. Proficiency, at the very bottom left.
Taliesin: Yeah, I don't have a number for that.
Matt: You can add your proficiency modifier to your intelligence check. Add your intelligence modifier plus four.
Taliesin: Ah, thank you. 17.
Matt: All right, and so what are you trying to accomplish with this arrow again?
Taliesin: I was just trying to make an entanglement arrow. It's a trapper's arrow.
Matt: Okay. You manage to work out what seems like a tanglefoot bag-type detonation, where if an arrow were fired, it would be a grapple check against the individual, probably give them penalties until they're able to break free of the grapple. So yeah, success on that one.
Travis: Nice job, Doogie.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be Hawkeyeing Laura out at some point, I got a couple of them.
Orion: Before I retire, Clarota, you said you wanted to speak with me later. Anything in particular, or you wish to save it for after the battle?
Matt: "Perhaps after. I just am curious about the source of your Arcane power."
Orion: Ooh, I'd be happy to discuss it. I could learn a great deal from you as well.
Matt: "Later."
Orion: Later, of course. I go to my books.
Matt: So Clarota closes his eyes, and kind of goes into a meditative stance. The rest of you, those who have spells to choose, go ahead and choose your spells accordingly for the next day.
Travis: Rub it in. I'm sharpening my ax.
Matt: Good. Good.
Travis: It is good.
Sam: Just doing my vocal warmups. ♫ Me me me me me me me me me ♫
Marisha: I'm meditating.
Sam: ♫ Molto bene, molto bene, molto bene, molto bene ♫
Travis: The human torch was denied a bank loan. (all laugh)
Matt: So as you all have your evening's rest... Not very comfortable. Number one, you're in the middle of a tent of a goblinoid city. Second, just the general proximity of sleeping near an illithid, you just have a general sense of unsettling dreams, imagery that is disturbing. Pike, you have many flashbacks to the vision you had, and actually wake partway through the night in a cold sweat. As you wake up, you all kind of slowly come to, it's about four hours into the evening's rest. You feel a slight tremor, a familiar tremor that you felt once before in this cavern. (rumbling) You feel the ground begin to vibrate and shake.
Taliesin: I get up and look around.
Sam: Is Clay awake? (all laugh)
Matt: Eyes are open, just sitting there.
Sam: Clarota, do you know what that rumbling is?
Matt: "There are many creatures that live in this rock. You'd best be still."
Sam: Ooh, still.
Matt: "Still."
Orion: Don't move.
Travis: So, vocal warm ups.
Matt: Everyone make a stealth check.
Marisha: Oh!
Travis: Fucking nipples.
Marisha: Pooper.
Travis: We get advantage on that, right?
Matt: Nope!
Orion: 16.
Sam: 14.
Marisha: 19.
Taliesin: 18.
Liam: 20.
Ashley: One.
Travis: One. (all laugh)
Matt: Two natural ones?
Travis: Yup!
Sam: After her two natural 20's.
Liam: Nothing to add.
Ashley: Nothing to add. Well I'm new to armor, you know.
Matt: You both rolled natural ones. Those both count as two failures.
Ashley: Fuck.
Matt: Thankfully, the rest of your group all rolled pretty high. So it was four versus five.
Orion: Yes!
Matt: You guys just barely succeed. As you all hold still, barely breathe, the rumbling intensifies, and goes on for a good minute, minute and a half, before it eventually subsides.
Travis: Aw. Thought we were gonna get a warm up.
Matt: Fades into the distance. Rumbling is complete. It appears to be no issue. Clarota says, "Many of these creatures, they pick up on movement, in that sound, be wary."
Liam: What creatures are you speaking of now? Is this something--
Sam: The rumbling creatures.
Liam: But what are they?
Orion: Probably buttholes.
Matt: "I've only got glimpses."
Liam: This is something worse than umberhulks, I assume.
Matt: "Larger, yes."
Sam: All right, we've all rested up.
Liam: Buttholes in the underdark!
Sam: I had a crazy dream. It said if Geek & Sundry got to 1,400 followers, there would be some sort of a giveaway.
Orion: Oh, I had the same dream, Scanlan!
Sam: Wow!
Matt: Yeah guys, just so you're aware, every 50 subscribers we get, we are giving away an awesome Geek & Sundry game package.
Zac: Ethanmyhead just won one.
Matt: Oh, there you go, congratulations! We already got a winner. We'll be putting those out for every 50 subscribers we get tonight. We'll be choosing one to win that awesome award, our wonderful package, so keep that in mind.
Sam: So the plan is again, you and I, stealth. The rest, attack with light? What's first, what's second, what happens here?
Liam: Well, I need to take a moment to find some-- I'm gonna look around and see if I can find any pitch, anywhere in the goblin camp.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a survival check. Actually, this would be investigation.
Liam: Investigation. I got the exact same number, 12.
Matt: Takes about an hour. You manage to find, essentially, a few piles of rather disgusting, sticky, goblinoid refuse, that you imagine will probably stick and burn pretty well. In a pitch-type way, yeah.
Liam: Goblin shit?
Matt: You find just a whole bunch of goblin shit.
Liam: Let's cook it up a little.
Taliesin: How do you feel about lacing it with gun powder?
Sam: I'll make some fire for you.
Liam: Feel pretty good about that.
Marisha: Goblin molotov cocktails? I like that.
Taliesin: Goblin poop cocktail.
Liam: So here's how I think this goes. I think the team infuses the carpet, and any shields, or head pots they have with radiant light. They go in and make a big stink on the side of the camp. You and I go in, you're invisible. I'm a--
Sam: Fly, flea, mosquito, dragonfly, whatever you'd like.
Liam: Yes, let's say fly. We go in, find the illithid, and then we pop in, you yell, "Hey, Spanky," throw goblin shit in its face.
Sam: Or I try to blind it with magic.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: Both.
Orion: Both! Why not both?
Liam: We want to increase our odds. As soon as he's blind, I go in for the kill. And then it's on us to deal with what happens after that.
Travis: It's playtime.
Liam: It's playtime.
Sam: Might I suggest one other wrinkle.
Liam: Yes, please do.
Sam: Remember there are some dwarves being held captive. We can make our way to them and release them.
Travis: We don't need all of them, though. Just to cause further distraction, or to get some allies on the inside.
Liam: It's possible they could be weary, frightened.
Taliesin: Mind controlled.
Liam: Seems unreliable-- yes, mind controlled.
Travis: They're probably ready to fight, like me. (all laugh)
Sam: Grog, we understand, you want to bash some things.
Liam: Your time to kill is coming.
Sam: All right, is there anyone else in the party who could help us with stealth, or anything?
Ashley: Definitely not me.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Clang clang. ASHLEY Clang clang clang clang.
Matt: As a note, just remember. Because you're the one who walked through. There is essentially a shanty town, a tent city of war tents. With a few rock formations. You also notice that, or you remember last time, that there was the main square that had the raised platform. And then there was the small stone barracks, where it seemed both the mind flayer and the duergar general both went back in.
Sam: So we gotta go into the barracks.
Matt: Well that's where you saw at least they were last time you were there.
Liam: That's our starting point, I imagine.
Orion: Well, there's two targets.
Sam: So we gotta get in, and then get in.
Liam: The main thing is to get the illithid, because if he's out, nobody's-- Then they're all separate. He's playing chess with all his minions until we take him out.
Travis: I hate chess.
Orion: So we all strike right on him. You two are going to take that little journey. The rest of us, what shall we do? I have many options and they're all fun. So Percy. Your sniper rifle. I should think that you want to post up and start taking out position.
Taliesin: I'll do that at first, but then eventually I'm going to just have to jump into the fray.
Orion: Yes, of course, onslaught to the rest of the camp, that we'll go about it too, right? Make a bunch of noise, a bunch of light.
Sam: How are you going to get Grog over there?
Marisha: I'm gonna put a giant sunlight beacon on his head, and I'm gonna release him to the wilds.
Liam: Yes, but there's no bridge, we talked about--
Marisha: Oh, how are we gonna get him over it?
Liam: We have an infinite amount of rope.
Sam: How do we get it over there?
Liam: Tiberius talks about making him light as a feather.
Travis: Or you can fly me.
Sam: Yes, you can fly him, right?
Orion: Perhaps you can fly.
Travis: Why don't we turn my pot into a lighthouse, and then you fly me over, and I'll do like, abominable snow man walk.
Marisha: I like that.
Liam: Clarota, is there anything you can do to help us on this endeavor?
Matt: "I can try to cloud his mind with mine, but you have to swear to protect me from harm."
Liam: You have our word.
Sam: -- that we will try. (all laugh)
Matt: "Then I will come. You must work swiftly. If we can leap most of the city, get to that barrack, storm it, and take out the mind flayer that resides."
Sam: Let's set down right in the middle of the thing.
Marisha: Well I was gonna say, can we set down where we're kind of backing you guys up, holding the fort down while you guys go?
Liam: There's no bridge.
Sam: We all have to get there.
Marisha: I'm not worried about that.
Liam: Get over together, get to the edge.
Sam: Yes, but where are we going to make land? In the middle of the shit, next to the barracks?
Marisha: I say we might as well go closest to the barracks as we can get.
Sam: Okay, then you and I can get in the barracks.
Liam: That's a good idea. If we go as high as we can, and just hug the ceiling of this motherfucker, and then go down in the middle. And as we're going down, you turn me into a fly and go invisible, and that's when all hell breaks lose.
Travis: I like that part. Let's do it.
Liam: No time like the present.
Travis: Hands up if you're in.
Marisha: I'm gonna start buffing people like crazy.
Orion: I cast Stoneskin.
Taliesin: Gonna be buffing us like a vampire slayer.
Marisha: Oh! Joss Whedon up in this bitch!
Sam: Question to the dungeon master.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: I think my Polymorph spell is a concentration spell.
Matt: It is, yes.
Sam: I'm going solo. (sighs)
Travis: Do it.
Sam: I can get you in. I can make you a fly, but I can't be invisible at the same time.
Liam: I will sneak through. If shit goes south, I will peel off and join the others.
Marisha: Well, I can cast Pass Without A Trace on myself, and as long as we hug close to me, there's an area around me that's like a dark shadow. We get like, all stealthy.
Sam: We're going in.
Liam: We're just gonna have to improvise that. We'll do it live, we'll do it live.
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait! Don't go in yet. Let me buff people.
Matt: You said you were casting Stoneskin? Stoneskin is concentration. The moment you cast another concentration spell, it goes away.
Orion: Oh, right. So I don't cast it, then. (all laugh) God damned concentration spells.
Travis: I would like to cast, um. (all laugh)
Travis: Blood Lust on myself. Blood Lust.
Marisha: I go ahead and I cast Enhance Ability on Vex.
All: Vax.
Liam: Sorry, everybody does it. Our mother did it, I do it sometimes.
Matt: To increase his dexterity?
Marisha: To increase your dexterity.
Matt: So essentially you have advantage on dexterity-based checks, yeah.
Marisha: Which is your stealth, right?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: And then I'm gonna go ahead and let me keep track of all this. And I'm gonna go ahead and cast Daylight on Grog's helmet. Are we ready for this, are we going?
Sam: Yeah, let's go.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And I'm gonna go ahead and cast Daylight on--
Sam: Wait.
Travis: What?
Sam: Wait. We're trying to sneak over them before we land. Don't cast Daylight on anything yet. We don't wanna be bright and shiny in the sky.
Matt: A giant flare coasting over the city.
Travis: We'll be like UFO's.
Liam: (hissing)
Marisha: I'm gonna go ahead and cast Pass Without A Trace on myself.
Matt: All right, so that's preparation there.
Sam: I'm gonna sing a little ditty to inspire Vax. ♫ I didn't see the Vax ♫ 'Cause he's so goddamned stealthy ♫ Da da da da da da da da
Travis: Was that "I Saw The Sun"?
Sam: Yes it was. (all laugh)
Matt: That wondrous rendition allows you a d8 inspiration dice, hold on to that.
Orion: Is everybody finished?
Liam: Vox Machina, let's do this shit.
Marisha: I turn into an eagle, and I'll take the gnomes.
Matt: All right. Scanlan. Pike is heavy with the plate mail, but it's still enough to carry with your giant eagle form.
Liam: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet, and Tiberius, are you good to help Grog fly across?
Orion: Fly.
Matt: At which point you feel this strange lifting sensation, for a second your stomach kind of has butterflies, and you realize that you can just think forward, and you drift forward. Think back, you drift back. Think up, you drift up.
Travis: Amazing, don't puke in the helmet though, that would be gross. (imitates puking)
Orion: Am I light enough for him to take me in?
Travis: I can't see anything. Just a cauldron on my head.
Orion: For him to carry me.
Matt: For him to carry you? Yeah, yeah.
Orion: I hop on your back. Let's go, Grog.
Travis: Great.
Marisha: I guess the rest of them are on the rug?
Travis: I can't see, so you gotta tell me. I start flying the wrong way.
Orion: Back up, the other way, other way, very good.
Matt: You actually clutch Grog by the sides of his face, and start steering him. (all laugh)
Orion: Wherever I move your head, just tilt that way.
Sam: Are we all in flight now?
Liam: We're all taken care of, yes.
Sam: And the carpet?
Liam: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet.
Sam: What about Vex? Is she with us?
Ashley: She's on the carpet.
Sam: She's staying behind.
Matt: Vex, for the time being, because it's just easier to organize for that, is coming on the carpet with you guys, and is preparing in case she is needed.
Taliesin: She's just quiet 'cause she's feeling smug about the last game.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: She's feeling smug about making another RPG right now.
Liam: She'll be back.
Sam: I wanna see how you fly, Grog.
Orion: It's really rickety!
Travis: It's one arm in and one forward. (all laugh)
Orion: Just think.
Liam: Do you propel yourself with thoughts?
Matt: It's an awkward zig zag.
Taliesin: Do you think happy thoughts?
Marisha: I'm gonna fly in the middle between Grog and the carpet, that way my Pass Without A Trace encompasses everybody.
Matt: All right.
Liam: I turn to Scanlan and say, Scanlan, we are probably going to die today. It has been an honor.
Sam: It has been an honor.
Ashley: You won't die today.
Sam: Only one of us will die. And it won't be me. I can be invisible. (all laugh)
Orion: You're not listening, it'll just happen.
Liam: What were you saying Tiberius?
Orion: Nothing.
Liam: Don't play it that way, what were you saying?
Orion: I was saying, if you're all finished, I'll just make you invisible right before it happens.
Matt: You guys are all coasting over the chasm. Now you're over the top of the large bridge, and the 200-foot-wide open hole in this tunnel that leads to the lake below. As you glance down, you can see just a little bit of a trickle from the soft red light that is deeper inside. You can see the small streams of lava, they're just slowly pooling at the bottom on the outskirts of the lake proper. As you begin to make it to the other side, you can see tiny shapes moving in this barely lit war camp of the duergar. As you're coasting over, and Clarota is along with you guys with his hood up, he kind of whispers into all of your heads, just, "Beware that some of these armies carry abominations created below within my city. I know not what to expect from them. So be wary." As this happens, everyone make a stealth check. Everyone, because of the Pass Without A Track, everyone gets a plus ten to their stealth check.
Travis: Plus ten?
Matt: Plus ten. Thanks to Keyleth.
Sam: Thank God.
Matt: Keyleth, however, you are carrying two gnomes, so you have a disadvantage on it.
Ashley: Oh no.
Liam: It's all right.
Marisha: Even with the plus 10? 18?
Matt: 18.
Sam: 15.
Taliesin: 22.
Travis: 27.
Sam: Wow.
Ashley: 23.
Liam: 28.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to crest over the very top of the war camp, and looking down you can see now, there are what looks to be the beginnings of tunneling siege engines being constructed.
Sam: What? Siege?
Matt: Siege. You can see giant wheeled carts with drills up front, giant auger bores that are being currently constructed. You can see what looks like a series of weapons being stacked at the ready. You can see there is a preparation for some sort of attack on the city above.
Liam: Want to take Kraghammer.
Matt: Continue to press ahead. There does not seem to be any reaction to your flying.
Sam: Don't say anything.
Liam: This close to the ceiling.
Ashley: Good thing we didn't cast the light.
Orion: We can all talk to each other.
Sam: Whisper to each other. Shut up!
Marisha: Oh, cool.
Sam: Just wait 'til we get there.
Matt: You guys make it towards the center portion of the city.
Travis: Roll shake it, roll shake it, roll shake it.
Taliesin: Die rolls.
Matt: You can just start beginning to see the opening in the center of this war camp. There is a circle where there are no tents constructed, you can see what looks to be a small wooden platform, and there is a stone building that is of makeshift functional construction. Not pretty, but functional, looks like a barracks, or some sort of a large bunker. Right on the northern side of that opening, that center portion of the war camp. That would be what you saw, both the general and the mind flayer head of this encampment go into last time you--
Sam: The barracks.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: With a roof?
Matt: There is a roof to it, you don't know if there's any roof access. But there is a roof.
Liam: Tiberius, can you turn me invisible now.
Orion: (sputtering)
Sam: But we're still in the air, right? He's gotta concentrate on that.
Liam: He's sitting on the carpet.
Sam: Yeah but he's--
Marisha: Thinking about--
Sam: Him flying.
Orion: I cast invisibility on you, that's when everything happens. (all laugh)
Marisha: Just falls from the air.
Liam: So are we floating above?
Matt: You guys are currently floating about 100 to 150 feet above the war camp, you do not appear to have been noticed yet.
Travis: Get down there and wing it.
Sam: Should we land on the roof? Or do we land right outside the barracks door? What do we do?
Ashley: Roof, roof, roof.
Sam: You guys wanna stay up and we'll go down?
Travis: You go! Yes.
Sam: Yeah?
Travis: Yes!
Marisha: We can start on the roof, that way that gives us time.
Liam: But I can't go invisible while you're flying.
Travis: Who needs you to be invisible? You're a stealthy bastard.
Orion: We land on the roof, we get in there, I cast Invisibility on you, and then you go do your thing.
Liam: We're running the risk of as we come down on Duergar, going (groans).
Orion: We would risk that anyway, either way.
Sam: I'm so scared right now. (all laugh)
Travis: Why don't we land on the roof and we all lay flat, except for the people that are going in, and you cast Invisibility.
Sam: This is the exact conversation they had when they were about to go kill Osama. (all laugh)
Orion: Wait, I have an idea.
Travis: Oh God.
Orion: Is there enough weight for me get on the carpet at this point?
Ashley: This is fucking stressful.
Matt: You can certainly try. There was weight, but you're not aware of how much was on it.
Orion: Yes I do, it's 1000 pounds.
Matt: You don't know how much weight is on there, total.
Orion: Everybody, how much do you weigh?
Sam: Don't ask a woman that!
Orion: I'm sorry, Your Highness, but I need to know. The idea is if, I can step off on the carpet, and hang with you guys, then Grog you can float down to the whatchamacallit, and take Vax here, then I can, oh shit, I need to be near you to cast it, damn it! (all laugh)
Marisha: Let's just land on the roof.
Ashley: Let's land on the roof.
Liam: We're gonna go in, we're gonna hit the roof, you turn me invisible, he turns him invisible, you guys light up the night, and we just do it, we just gotta go.
Ashley: We're lighting up now?
Sam: You light up on the roof? Let's look for access first. Don't light up 'til we give the go aside.
Ashley: We're still not safe stealthy.
Orion: We need to wait before we light up.
Liam: If anyone takes notice, then turn off the lights.
Sam: By the way--
Taliesin: Do not light up until you see the black or greens of their eyes.
Sam: By the way, Clarota-- Clarota you have definitely picked the right people to assist you.
Matt: There's no verbal response, but you do just emotionally sense a slight hint of regret. (all laugh)
Matt: Emanating from the mind flayer.
Sam: We got this! All right, let's go land on the roof.
Liam: All right, let's do it.
Matt: You guys descend.
Orion: Down, down.
Matt: Eagle flies down, you both, (wind rushing), as part of the landing, everyone make a secondary stealth check.
Taliesin: We still have that plus 10?
Marisha: We still have that plus 10?
Matt: You still have the spell.
Orion: Oh yes!
Marisha: Oh, that was cocked.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Oh, no!
Taliesin: You're a terrible person.
Sam: 30.
Orion: 20.
Marisha: I'm like those boobies, that crash land when they fall.
Matt: You rolled at disadvantage?
Marisha: Well, I rolled a one.
Matt: Okay. Two failures.
Taliesin: That's a 15, 29.
Travis: 23.
Ashley: 21.
Liam: 28.
Matt: Pass Without A Trace is the saving grace. A bit of a harsh landing, from your perspective, but thankfully you have two small gnomes to break your fall.
Ashley: (groan)
Sam: (groan)
Matt: You drag them a little bit across the stonework on the top. It's not stonework, actually. Most of this whole thing, is stonework, it looks like the roof of this is made of like a thick scavenged wood. Whether it was taken from the surface or from the mines itself, it is just wooden planks that are all keeping--
Ashley: Let's go in through the roof.
Taliesin: It's reclaimed, it's very nice.
Liam: If that thing sees us, though, it could be game over. I still think we should stick to the plan of blinding it.
Orion: Yeah, do it.
Sam: So some of us need to go inside.
Liam: You and I.
Travis: Yeah, the two go inside, and if shit goes down, we light it up.
Liam: I will fucking yell into my earring if shit goes down, and you guys gotta pray for me.
Travis: Go find shit!
Sam: We look around for any roof access.
Travis: Come on, Chip 'n' Dale.
Matt: Looking around, there is no roof entrance. It looks like it is purely a functional roof for any weathering, rocks, you do see there are a few small rocks and pieces of cavern that may have plummeted here.
Sam: No chimneys.
Matt: No chimneys, no nothing, there doesn't appear to be a fireplace, or any sort of interior like that. Glancing over the sides, you can see that on the floor-- You can't really tell if there's two floors or not, it looks tall enough to have two floors, but you don't see a set of windows or anything that belies that to you. May just be a really tall single floor. But there are a couple of small window openings, one on each side of-- [static]
Sam: We're gonna go--
Liam: Tiberius, could you do me a favor of making me disappear?
Orion: Yes, when I do this, though, it's going to be very cool. (all laugh)
Liam: Holy shit, where are my hands?
Orion: Right?
Matt: You immediately disappear from view. You currently, visually do not exist.
Marisha: And you still have my buff.
Travis: We're like, flat on the roof, right?
Matt: You guys are all on the roof now, you're fine. Your Fly spell vanishes, you feel your weight return to you for a second. For a split moment you're a little sad, 'cause you were having fun.
Travis: Oh. (all laugh)
Travis: I was a dancer.
Sam: We can see the window, we pick one of the sides, I don't know, west side.
Matt: West side!
Sam: Is it a single pane? Is it an openable window?
Matt: As you glance over, it is just an opening. There is no glass. There is nothing blocking the way. It is about roughly big enough to fit a normal-sized half-elf or human.
Liam: I take Scanlan by the scruff, and swing him down.
Sam: Oh, I turn invisible.
Matt: As you grab him and you're bringing him down, you cast Invisibility on yourself, you both vanish now, all the rest of you are kind of holding your breath, hoping that now that you don't know what's happening, it's gonna go well.
Liam: I'm scaling in after him.
Liam: Go ahead and just make an acrobatics check.
Sam: Don't roll a one, please don't drop me.
Liam: 18.
Matt: All right, yeah, you're good. You gingerly scale down the wall, the stones thankfully are just haphazardly put together, where there's enough grip space for you to catch on.
Sam: I have a climbing kit! (all laugh)
Liam: We're in, we're in.
Matt: Little late for that, but okay. (all laugh)
Matt: You lower him down, you bring him inside, you step down through the opening, into the center of the hallway.
Sam: We can't talk to each other.
Travis: Yes we get a map, finally!
Sam: We can't signal each other, and we don't know where each other is. I hold his hand. (all laugh)
Liam: We're holding hands, I'm leaning way down on the side.
Travis: 'Course you are.
Liam: Sam and I have done this before.
Orion: I use my earring.
Sam: I'm not gonna talk back to you, so whatever you say.
Orion: Just to remind you of how these particular things work, I'm not actually talking right now. So you can just talk to each other through the rings.
Matt: As the two of you step into this room, you look about you, and there are some ramshackle, makeshift beds in the room. Five to be exact, from right to left. This appears to be one portion of a barracks-type sleeping arrangement. Beds are empty, they're kind of tossed, they're not like well-kept or anything. There's sheets kind of tossed about, and it smells awful in here, but it--
Liam: First, I just heard Tiberius' voice in my head. So I'm going to test it out and think. Scanlan, can you hear me?
Sam: Can I hear him?
Matt: From?
Liam: I heard Tiberius whispering about.
Sam: From thoughts only, can I hear him?
Matt: No.
Liam: I tug on his hand to keep going into the barracks.
Sam: I notice that his hand is weirdly cold and sweaty.
Matt: Yeah, not weirdly.
Liam: You just lean to live with the stage fright, you never move past it. Should we pause right now?
Marisha: You didn't bring your stuff?
Laura: I didn't have it!
Orion: Come on in!
Liam: Look, my sister's here.
Laura: Hello!
Liam: We'll make it work. We'll bring you up to speed later, you're on the roof of Osama Bin Laden's house. (all laugh)
Liam: So question for the DM, I'm invisible. Do I need to stealth, do I stealth?
Matt: There's still a stealth check 'cause you're invisible, but noise is still a factor. You just have advantage on your stealth check.
Liam: So, I think we should probably stealth. And start moving in.
Sam: Yeah, that's, we tug each other.
Matt: Beyond being invisible, you guys make your stealth check.
Sam: I mean, I'm invisible, and I rolled a five.
Matt: You have an advantage, you roll twice. 'Cause you're both invisible.
Sam: 13.
Liam: 20.
Matt: All right. You both feel you're stealthed, there is one opening into a hallway here.
Liam: We have, does anyone have a laser light?
Travis: Yep.
Liam: All right.
Travis: Squeeze it together. Press the little button.
Liam: Squeeze it together? Ah, there we go. Okay so we're going to go down here.
Matt: Down to this one. As you guys step out, you can see immediately there are two duergar guards right by a door that leads to a central chamber.
Liam: So we're gonna go this way.
Matt: All right. Immediately you see--
Travis: I like how you guys have different-colored lightsabers.
Matt: Two more Duergar guards.
Travis: (lightsaber noises)
Liam: All right, I'm inching up, I'm pulling Scanlan behind me, but I'm inching up to this door, just peeking through, seeing what I can see.
Matt: Okay, looking inside, you can see these small symbols, basically just red stone, the glow stone, that lights the underground caverns here and in a large portion of Kraghammer, are just embedded in the wall in a small sconce. Peering through here, you see one against the wall, you also see along the edges here, what looks to be racks of spears and pikes and hammers and various war accoutrements of weapons, just hanging, and there's a set of armor, over a small, wooden arrangement, the armor itself is just being stored there. This looks to be like a fast-grab armory.
Liam: Okay. I pull Scanlan by the hand, and we enter into this room.
Sam: This is so romantic.
Liam: It's just like the day we met, Sam.
Matt: You guys enter.
Liam: Quietly walking this way. We're past the door, that looks like the front door.
Matt: It is the front door, it is currently closed, though.
Liam: We're gonna keep going this way.
Sam: Oh man, we're doing-- we're flanking!
Matt: Just come out this way. There is one duergar here. There doesn't appear to be a doorway or entrance to the central chamber on this side of the hallway.
Sam: That's pretty good.
Liam: I still have the pitch in a bucket. The shit in a bucket in my hand, by the way.
Sam: We can take these guys, I'm not worried about that.
Liam: But we'd make noise. How far apart are the two duergar standing in that door?
Matt: They're about five feet apart, just enough space, like one is on each side of the doorway.
Liam: Okay.
Sam: Wait. What are those red things right there?
Matt: Those are the small sconces with the glow stone, the red stone that lights the--
Sam: So we're trying to get there.
Orion: -- with Greater Invisibility, so you can attack, and you'll still be invisible.
Liam: I pull a gold coin out of my pocket, and throw it in this corner.
Sam: This is straight up Metal Gear. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and just make a general dexterity check.
Liam: And because of Keyleth, I have advantage, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Orion: Sure do.
Liam: So this is, what is this?
Matt: Just a dexterity modifier.
Liam: So that's a 17.
Matt: All right, you-- (coin ringing) Ringing sound, both of the duergar kinda look over. They look at each other. Grunt for a second. This one nods her head and begins walking over to inspect it, this one stays at its post.
Marisha: (Metal Gear voice) Must have been my imagination. (all laugh)
Liam: I pull Scanlan behind me, and tiptoe right behind this asshole.
Travis: Do it! Put it in him!
Liam: And take out my vorpal blade. And reach out and grab him by the hair and stick it in the back of his neck.
Sam: You got my dice.
Matt: All right, so, as you reach up, you grasp the back of this really nasty, wiry, thick duergar hair--
Liam: I'm so tense right now.
Matt: You yank the head back, and take the base of the blade, go ahead and make an attack roll. It's a surprise roll, so you have an advantage on the attack.
Liam: Okay, good.
Matt: I believe you have a bonus too, if you get the attack.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: Sneak attack?
Liam: Well, I get-- Yes, I get advantage, but you can't triple up on advantage I believe? (loud bang offscreen)
Sam: What was that?
Matt: That was to freak you out. All right, so just double-checking here as part of your ability.
Sam: Remember every 50 subscribers gets a free giveaway.
Orion: Subscribe now, kids.
Ashley: What is that smile?
Matt: If you score it, and the creature is surprised, it is a critical hit, that's the other thing I was going to mention.
Liam: Thank you. So this isn't a dexterity check, this is an attack.
Matt: This is an attack.
Liam: Okay. So that's a 26.
Matt: That is going to hit, and that is a critical hit. Go ahead and roll damage with Sneak Attack.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Laura: Die die die.
Liam: I'm sweating. Okay, that's two plus seven is nine. That's nine, that's just that part. Six. Seven. Nine. 14. And 19. Which is, what's doubled, the Sneak Attack damage?
Matt: The Sneak Attack damage and the dice damage.
Matt: And the dice damage, 19 plus, is 26, 52.
Marisha: Oh!
Taliesin: Whoa!
Matt: As you pull the head back, you can hear a slight, a slight (gurgles) is about as much noise as can make it out before the blade just, right out the front of its throat, blocking any passage of the air. As you hold it, you twist the blade, it goes limp in your hand, but you catch it and keep holding it there, so it doesn't make any noise. You're now clutching a dead duergar.
Sam: Easy, easy.
Ashley: (shushes) Night-night.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Travis: Lean him up against the wall! Like he's standing there.
Liam: Just had a thought, I'm going to sit him back against the wall, and let him slide against it, and grab Scanlan, and into the room.
Matt: Into this room?
Marisha: There's Scanlan.
Taliesin: He's still standing up, kind of.
Laura: Why is he leading Scanlan, what's happening?
Liam: (shushes)
Sam: While I'm invisible, I look around for traps. I'm just gonna see if there's any trap doors.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: Not great?
Liam: I got a 28.
Sam: Nine.
Matt: You notice no traps. What you do notice, though, is there a giant kind of war room table, at the top of this raised platform. It's about six feet up, and there's a stairway that leads up to it. You see at the table. One of the illithid mind flayers. The armored general that you saw before. And there are two other duergar currently at the table.
Travis: Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Ashley: Stay invisible.
Sam: We can't communicate.
Travis: You guys have got seconds until that other guard comes back.
Liam: We can't talk.
Matt: You hear footsteps behind you.
Liam: I put the bucket of shit into Scanlan's hands.
Laura: What are you doing?
Liam: Give him a little nudge, a gentle little nudge.
Sam: I step forward into the room, and I hurl it at the fucker's face. The mind controllers.
Liam: And I'm rolling behind him at the same time. Behind the illithid, ready to go.
Matt: So I'll say you go up here as well?
Liam: Oh yeah, behind him, behind him.
Laura: What is happening?
Matt: Make a stealth check, both of you.
Travis: Oh God, oh God. Oh God, over extended.
Sam: Wait, do we get the plus ten to stealth?
Matt: No.
Liam: Plus advantage, oh thank christ.
Sam: 19.
Liam: Using Scanlan's advantage, so 16, 29. (sighs)
Matt: Okay. You slink up behind, seemingly unnoticed. There's a slight twitch to the mind flayer's head, for a second, as you go ahead, and take a big ol'--
Sam: Bucket of shit!
Matt: And fling it. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and make an attack roll. It would be, you're not proficient with goblin shit buckets, unfortunately, so go ahead and roll a d20, and add your dexterity.
Orion: (groans)
Sam: My dexterity?
Matt: Dexterity or strength, whichever's higher, strength higher?
Sam: No, no, strength is not higher for me. Oh, it is higher! So 19.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Oh my God.
Matt: You fling it as the Invisibility spell wears off of you as part of the attack, you fling the bucket. A spray of thick, green, goblin fecal matter goes streaking through the air as the illithid turns, its eyes wide, to see you suddenly appear, and then suddenly see this entire batch of thick goblin shit just (splashes) across its face. Suddenly you see his tentacles writhing, as it screams, all of you hear in your head a scream.
Liam: I'm stabbing, I'm stabbing!
Orion: I cast Stoneskin immediately.
Matt: As this happens, you cast Stoneskin, you go in for the blade, and you hear a counter voice in your mind.
Ashley: Fuck.
Matt: Clarota going, "Now."
Marisha: I cast Light on Grog's head!
Matt: Your head comes to an extremely bright glow, all of you averting your gaze.
Liam: This is stealth, right? Stealth for me?
Matt: No, you're invisible.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Sam: Attack, attack, kill him!
Liam: 29! 29!
Matt: That definitely rolls to hit, you have surprise. Go ahead and roll.
Liam: That's a critical, right? I'm assassinating this mother fucker.
Matt: It's a critical, technically. Yep.
Sam: We're going for the general?
Liam: The illithid can control us all.
Ashley: Should we go in?
Orion: We don't know anything.
Matt: So, roll damage on this.
Liam: Roll my damage.
Orion: We just heard a scream. Oh, we can act on that.
Travis: And I rage.
Matt: Stone skin. Light on his head.
Travis: Rage.
Matt: Going into a rage.
Ashley: Daylight on my shield.
Matt: Daylight on your shield.
Laura: I'm so happy to be here. (all laugh)
Matt: I will say for the purposes of this battle, there is no Trinket here, because Trinket would not have fit across the way to get there.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Didn't you give her an arrow?
Taliesin: Yes, and you have an entrapment arrow now.
Laura: Okay, I get ready for that.
Liam: Okay, DM? 62 into the back of his head.
Taliesin: Oh, shit!
Travis: 62?
Ashley: How?
Liam: Critical hit.
Matt: You take the blade, and as it pierces the back--
Liam: Oh, it's a poison one by the way.
Orion: Damn!
Matt: It pierces the back of its skull, you feel the muscles in its neck tense in reaction to the blade, but the blade slips past. You can see a gout of purplish-black blood begin to spill from its neck, as it instinctually reaches up, and pulls the blade from the back of its head. What's the DC on the poison?
Liam: I have no idea.
Matt: It should be on the blade info.
Liam: Poison dagger.
Taliesin: Fuck. Ah!
Liam: I think it's oh, it's 15.
Taliesin: This was a good plan.
Matt: The poison does not seem to take effect, the body resists it. It is still alive. But it's clutching the back of its neck, as it turns around going (sputters), you can see its blood spurting out of its mouth, and its eyes are now just burning with rage. All the rest of these duergar are now reaching and pulling their weapons out. Everyone roll initiative. (all yell)
Laura: I don't have my stuff with me.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Oh, shit.
Sam: Let's kill some bad guys.
Travis: I don't know what you're doing.
Matt: All right, so. 25 to 20?
Liam: 20. Natural 20.
Matt: But you have no bonuses? You should have your dex bonus too.
Liam: Oh yeah, that's a 25.
Matt: So, I'm gonna say you're probably going in first, buddy.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: All right, 20, 25 to 20, anyone else?
Laura: Oh, I think I got like a 21.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: I got 16 plus--
Matt: Yep, that'd be 21, yeah. All right, so. 19, anyone?
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19, nice.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Gonna wing it.
Matt: 18, anyone?
Travis: 18.
Matt: Nice.
Orion: I got 16.
Marisha: Do you have like a picture, or a file anywhere, saved of your--
Laura: I got jack shit!
Marisha: Of your sheet?
Liam: We snuck into the war camp.
Laura: We're in the war camp?
Liam: We all landed on the top of their main building.
Matt: So, what's your?
Sam: 14.
Orion: I have 16.
Matt: 16, all right, so Tiberius. Scanlan, what was yours?
Ashley: Nine.
Marisha: Also nine.
Ashley: Not to brag.
Travis: Ashley's first two rolls were 20s.
Matt: All right, top of the round is Vax, with initiative.
Liam: I'm just gonna (grunts) in the back of his head some more. I'm still invisible according to Tiberius' Greater Invisibility spell.
Orion: No no no, as soon as I cast Stoneskin, you were attacking, that's why I said this is all going--
Matt: You are now visible, you are not stealthed.
Liam: Stab him in the back of the head. For assassinate, do I get the critical still here, DM?
Matt: No. You've gotten the one hit, it is completely aware of you, it is not a surprise attack.
Liam: So this is a 28.
Matt: It is so aware of you, it has never been more aware of you in its life. (all laugh)
Liam: I just rolled a 28.
Matt: Okay, that definitely hits. Attacking with your off hand?
Liam: Oh, so this is my bonus attack?
Matt: Yeah, you get the one attack, then you get the bonus hand. Which is just dice damage.
Liam: Okay, this is fire. My flame tongue dagger, I got two plus six is eight.
Matt: Eight?
Liam: Eight.
Matt: All right. And your other attack? Are you doing your bonus attack?
Liam: Was that the bonus attack? Or was that my main attack?
Matt: This is your new combat round, that was your main attack.
Liam: That's a nine, and here comes my bonus attack. Okay, 14.
Marisha: Kill him.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Liam: Here comes my keen dagger. Which is an eight.
Matt: Eight damage?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: So the first strike, you swing across with the flame tongue dagger. As it backs up, you put another gash across the front of its neck and chest area. It reels back and is looking at you with angry fury. You feel this coming shake, this horrible force of severe retribution coming to your mind, and as you're bracing for it, you take your other blade, you see its mouth opens up with frustration and anger as its tentacles kinda curl back, and just go in for the grab. You place the blade squarely into that maw, you feel the scraping of its teeth across your knuckles, but it doesn't matter, because whatever anger and light was once in its face, goes dark and dull. (all cheer)
Matt: As immediately it crumples to the ground, lifeless, pull the blade from the maw, mind flayer down. (all cheer)
Marisha: Yeah Vax!
Matt: He was next, but not anymore. As it falls to the ground, all the rest of the duergar immediately have a reaction. We'll get to their turn in a second. Vex, you're up. So you're on the roof, up here right now.
Sam: Gotta get inside first.
Laura: We have to run down in?
Matt: Run down, you're on a wooden roof surface, you heard before there's an entrance here, and an entrance there.
Liam: Windows are swing-down-in-able.
Sam: Unless Grog can just tear through the roof.
Laura: What was your initiative?
Liam: It's wood.
Taliesin: You can hold initiative.
Laura: I guess I'll hold, I'll hold, to see what the hell's happening.
Matt: So you hold on that. It is now this dude's turn, the general. He, unaffected by this, it seems, just angrily leaps on to the table, runs across, (groans), and jumps down towards you. As he does, you see his physical form seems to enlarge. His actual small dwarvish form begins to swell, his muscles tense. He's about the size of a normal person, if not a little bigger right now. He comes at you with this giant black, jagged metal war hammer. (groans) Comes down to swing at you, as he comes down, you see it burst into flame. There's fire now surrounding the head of this war hammer as it arcs toward you.
Sam: What?
Matt: That is going to be a 24 to hit.
Liam: Oh, it hits, but I use Uncanny Dodge to try to swoop out of the way as best I can.
Matt: All righty. You suffer-- That would be... 12 plus six fire damage, so, 18, reduced to nine. You take nine damage from the strike. As it strikes down, it goes for a back swing to attack you a second time. That is going to be a 15 versus AC. This time you just dodge completely out of the way. Derge out of the way.
Marisha: Derge.
Liam: Er mah gerd, I derged. (all laugh)
Matt: Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Just in case, I'm going to push off and wait for Grog. So I'm holding my turn.
Matt: Okay, Grog, your turn.
Travis: Right, so we're on the roof of the thing, right?
Matt: Correct, you are.
Travis: I'm in a rage, I take the pot still on my head, and I pick up my ax, and I draw one gigantic smash through the roof of the building.
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check.
Taliesin: God, yes.
Orion: This is all you're good for.
Marisha: Yes, come on Grog. This is all you're good for.
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Come on.
Sam: 15?
Matt: You bring your ax up, you bring it down on top as hard as you can, go ahead and roll ax damage.
Travis: Is that a d12?
Matt: It's a d12 plus your strength modifier. Plus two 'cause you're raging.
Travis: Do I get advantage on that?
Matt: No.
Travis: Seven.
Laura: Plus two 'cause you're raging.
Travis: Nine.
Matt: Nine damage, okay. As you swing the ax down, slam, it hits the wood. With the sheer weight of you there, and most of you guys conglomerated at that point, the actual roof breaks open and splits, into a small space. You slide down in the process.
Ashley: I jump on to Grog's foot. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. Go ahead, both of you make an acrobatics check.
Ashley: Oh, I wouldn't have had to do it. All right, well, I'm in the building.
Travis: 21.
Matt: Acrobatics check?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Pike? You have disadvantage 'cause you're in plate armor.
Ashley: Six.
Matt: All right, so Grog, you manage to land on your feet. Pike, you actually plummet off and fall off to the side, right there. You are currently prone, and from the fall, which you guys both dropped down, you managed to reduce the damage, but you from the fall, you take eight points of fall damage. You are now flat on your back, the wind knocked out of you for a minute.
Sam: Pike!
Ashley: I'm okay, I'm okay!
Sam: Oh okay, thank God.
Matt: All right. That brings us now, Vex and Percy are the same.
Taliesin: You first? Or should I go first?
Laura: Let's go down at the same time.
Taliesin: We'll go, we both jump down at the same time.
Matt: Both jump down, go ahead and make your acrobatics checks, guys.
Taliesin: 20.
Laura: Oh, I rolled really bad.
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: I rolled a two, but I add it to my acrobatics.
Matt: Yes, which is?
Sam: Which you don't know.
Laura: Which is like, I bet.
Matt: Your acrobatics, as you're proficient in it, and you have plus five dex, so that would bring it to 11?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Or no, 12.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Did you bring any Wheaton power from the other room? (all laugh)
Matt: You just barely land on your feet, you do take fall damage, but you don't fall prone. You take eight points of fall damage. Percy, you manage to land fine, without any damage, on your feet. On the ground, both of you kind of three-point landing. Avengers style.
Taliesin: Do I have time to get a shot off?
Matt: You do, that was your movement. So what's the deal?
Taliesin: Wow, I'm taking a second, and I see that Vax is getting attacked, and I'm gonna just take a shot at the-- The guy with the hammer. The biggest thing I see.
Matt: Do you have your glasses or goggles on?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's right, I have a helmet. So yeah, I'm wearing the helmet. I'm cool with that.
Matt: So go for it.
Liam: Do it, Starlord.
Taliesin: Ah! A natural 20. (all cheer)
Matt: Against the general, or one of the duergar?
Taliesin: The general.
Liam: The guy on the table attacking me.
Matt: Yeah, you can just barely see him, the stairway is up there.
Taliesin: Doesn't matter, as long as I have-- partial cover, it don't matter.
Matt: Right, I know, and he does have, he has three-quarters cover because of the distance, but you natural 20'd, so it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: I can ignore it, I ignore three-quarters cover.
Matt: You do, because--
Taliesin: I'm awesome.
Matt: Yep. (all laugh)
Taliesin: So that's double 1d-- I should have gotten some bonuses on that, I'm an idiot. Plus five. It's just double dice damage?
Matt: Double dice damage, then add your modifier.
Marisha: Woo!
Taliesin: That's 19 points of damage.
Matt: To the general, nice.
Marisha: Nice.
Matt: (explosion) He gets shot in the back of the shoulderplate, you hear it ricochet and a little bit of blood begins to streak off the back of his head. He looks over his shoulder with an angry grunt, you can see now this dwarf, who's still swelling in size. It looks, (growls), an angry nostril flare. You, have your bow ready?
Laura: I wanna do Lightning Arrow on the guy attacking my brother.
Matt: That guy there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll to attack.
Laura: Ugh, I don't think I hit.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: I had rolled a four.
Matt: A four, you had a plus 11 to hit, it's going to be a 15, unfortunately you miss. The arrow streaks past. Yeah, the arrow just ended up striking the wall back here and (explosion) arcs lightning throughout the wall, unfortunately does not--
Laura: I Hunter's Mark him anyway, just for future stuff.
Matt: You used your--
Laura: That was a bon--
Matt: You used your bonus action to cast Lightning Arrow.
Laura: Oh! So I get a regular attack now?
Matt: Well, that was part of your regular attack, like your next arrow you fired.
Laura: I get it. (all laugh)
Taliesin: You're going off-book, this is cool.
Matt: I think, let me double-check real fast, just to be sure. Because I don't wanna screw you out of a cool turn.
Laura: That is mine!
Matt: Next time bring your sheet.
Laura: I'm sorry.
Matt: That's okay. Yeah that's a bonus action to cast lightning, into your next arrow you fire, however, you do have two attacks. So you can shoot a second time. It just isn't affected by Lightning Arrow.
Laura: I roll 14.
Matt: That does hit, go ahead and roll damage there's 1d10, plus--
Laura: I think it was 1d8, actually.
Matt: Oh, for the longbow? Okay, 1d8 plus five for your dex, and then plus two for the bow. Plus seven.
Laura: Ten.
Matt: Ten damage, all right. So first arrow just streaks off, hits the wall. As he's kind of staring at Percy, he looks towards you, and as he does, the second arrow sticks into the plate, he kinda looks at it. (grunts) Just snaps it off in the armor. Grabbing his two-handed sword, or sorry, the war hammer in the other hand. Minis, it's confusing. All right, that ends your turn. Grog, the light that is beaming from your helmet currently right now is filling up the room, and it is extremely bright, most of you guys can handle it. You see all the duergar at the table like (groans), bunch of duergar come running in as well, as they run in, they're having to shield their eyes, but it's actually physically hurting them to be in that room right now. They're like (groans). Keeping it at bay, this one attempts to run in, this one's kind of making its way over. These guys here, this one's gonna go ahead and run here, this one's gonna go ahead and come to Grog. These two are gonna come up behind.
Sam: Is that guy the general?
Matt: That guy's the general, yes. This one's gonna come up behind to you. All right, they have disadvantage on their attacks.
Orion: Nice.
Matt: Because of the light. (all cheer)
Travis: 'Cause I'm so bright.
Matt: Attack against you.
Marisha: You're the brightest tool in the shed today.
Matt: That is a 17 versus AC. You just dodge out of the way. Next one, its war pick against you, Grog.
Ashley: Get skinny, get skinny.
Matt: That is 20 versus AC?
Travis: That hits.
Matt: That hits, all right. You take eight points of damage as it slams you with its war pick in the chest, you can feel it kind of gets about a half an inch of depth into it, but you just kind of shrug it off, and flex your muscles and it pops it out of your torso.
Travis: That's cute.
Matt: The two against you. That'll be a 19 versus AC.
Laura: Oh, yeah, that hits for sure.
Matt: And a 17 versus AC.
Laura: That-- hits.
Matt: All right, so you take two hits. That's 11 damage. And 13 damage as both of them start whaling you from behind with war picks.
Liam: Vex'ahlia! I yell.
Laura: 13 and what?
Matt: All right. Next up is the one that's attacking you.
Sam: Scanlan.
Matt: Scanlan, that's going to be, at a disadvantage, a 15 versus armor class.
Sam: 14.
Matt: 14? That still strikes you. You take eight points of damage from the war pick. Slamming you over the shoulder.
Sam: (yells out) Ah, I'm so awesome, Pike! (all laugh)
Matt: That ends their go, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: I'm still on the roof, right?
Matt: You're still on the roof, yes.
Orion: What can I see, like if I go down, what can I see?
Matt: You look through the hole, and you can see pretty much the entire battlefield. You're just up here looking down through it.
Orion: Oh, wonderful.
Matt: You're currently the only one still up there.
Orion: Yes, I think I'll stay right here, thank you very much. And how tall is the roof? How high is it? 15 feet?
Matt: It's about 25 feet up?
Orion: Okay, wonderful, wonderful. So, let me see here. This is fun.
Matt: You are technically, because I can do it.
Taliesin: Gonna use one of the little lifties, aren't you?
Matt: I am.
Marisha: Finally.
Liam: Bring the fire, Tiberus.
Sam: Oh. Toys.
Marisha: Now he's getting out toys.
Taliesin: Aw yeah.
Sam: Come on, do something.
Orion: I'm waiting for him to do something, 'cause it's so cool.
Marisha: I got him this for Christmas two years ago, and he's finally using it.
Matt: You are up here right now.
Orion: Awesome.
Travis: Three-dimensional fighting.
Liam: Toys, toys.
Matt: Is that visible?
Taliesin: Yeah. Sweet D&D rave.
Orion: Okay. I'm going to-- I see the two guards behind Vex, right? Is that what's going on?
Matt: Yep, right there.
Orion: And then the one duergar in front of Grog? Is that what's going on, too?
Matt: Yep, right there. Great, I will cast Grand Columns under all three of those dudes, and pin 'em. Right up against the roof. With my columns.
Liam: Clever girl.
Matt: The?
Orion: Pillars, yes.
Matt: But those pillars only go 15 feet up.
Orion: No, they go up to 25.
Matt: 25? Oh nice.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: That's why I always ask that question. It does 66 bludgeoning damage when it's pinned.
Ashley: Bye bye.
Sam: If they don't make their save.
Matt: All right, so. Go ahead and what is your DC on that? Your spell DC?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17, all right. All right, the heartiness of the duergar resilience gives them advantage on saves against spells. They all make their saves.
Sam: What?
Matt: But they are still up on these platforms now, raised above. So what is-- Does it do any damage if they make their saves?
Orion: (reading)
Sam: Come on iPhone, come on iphone!
Marisha: You're supposed to know everything!
Sam: iPhone five! This is the Fifth Edition.
Orion: Why doesn't it say? I guess it doesn't. It doesn't say.
Matt: So they are currently--
Sam: What is this madness?
Taliesin: Oh, you're crazy.
Orion: Oh, wait a minute, no. You make this call. If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 66 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a strength or dexterity check against the spell save DC. On a success they are no longer restrained, and must either move off the pole, or fall off of it. So they still, it still happens, but they're not pinned by it. Got you, okay. So go ahead and roll damage for all of them.
Marisha: Woo!
Matt: Good to know. (sings) New spells that just got released.
Liam: There's magic in the dwarves.
Sam: Magic in them.
Liam: The duergar.
Marisha: ♫ A whole new spell
Taliesin: ♫ A fantastic way to die
Marisha: ♫ No one can tell us no
Orion: 27 damage.
Marisha: ♫ Except for Matt (all laugh)
Matt: All three of the duergar are crushed.
Sam: To death?
Matt: Against the ceiling.
Orion: I did 27 damage to each one.
Travis: Nice!
Matt: Splat, splat, splat, they're all slammed into the ceiling, you can see limp dwarf arms and legs now dangling out of the stone pillars that are now permanently embedding them into the ceiling.
Liam: Yeah, son.
Sam: Crazy room!
Orion: I go like this, hah! I use two of my sorcerer points, and I cast Quicken Spell, and I look at the general, and I-- Because of my books I've been tampering with, I cast Blight on his eyes. Okay. 'Cause I wanna. (all laugh)
Matt: What's the-- the DC is 17, you said?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: All right, natural 20. So he makes his save. (all groan)
Orion: He takes 8d8 damage, and if he saves, he takes half the damage.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: 10, 15.
Liam: They were all eights, right?
Marisha: Well, he does all of them and then divides.
Sam: But you said half.
Marisha: He rolls all of them and then divides.
Sam: I see.
Orion: 15 plus, what is that, ten, 14.
Marisha: Your first one was--
Orion: 29?
Matt: So we'll say a solid 14 points of damage. All right, gotcha. No other effect, just the damage from Blight, right?
Orion: Yeah, because he made his save.
Matt: All right, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Oh, okay. I'm going to, (groans). God there's so few people to kill now. (all laugh)
Sam: You did it all, is it just us and the general?
Laura: Wait, that guy behind you though.
Matt: Just you guys, the general. There's a guy right behind you. Those guys got slammed.
Sam: Okay, I'm gonna cast Dominate Person on the general.
Travis: (laughs) What does that do?
Orion: Oh shit.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: He's a power top.
Matt: With advantage, he rolled a one and a two, on the saving throw. (all cheer)
Matt: That's ridiculous, okay.
Sam: I'm going to Dominate him and inform him, I can give him a command, right? Yes.
Orion: You can make him do whatever.
Sam: I'm going to tell him to stand down, and tell all of his allies to stand down.
Matt: All right. He turns around. Gives you a look, a strange look, he goes. "Men, all of you, drop your weapons! Now. We are surrendering to our new infiltrators." He throws his war hammer to the ground. The rest of them all kind of look around. Go ahead and, I'm gonna have you make intimidation check on his behalf.
Sam: Okay, on his behalf?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Do I add mine?
Matt: No, I'm just considering that, so you rolled 11?
Sam: 11. (sings along with the music)
Matt: The three other duergar look confused, look at the dead mind flayer, look at their general telling them to surrender, and they all kinda throw their weapons to the ground, and stand there with their arms to the side, kind of waiting for what's gonna happen next. As you finish that, Clarota slowly drifts down.
Sam: Oh yeah, Clarota, thanks for all the fucking help. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh no. This is gonna be bad.
Matt: Clarota just kinda looks around. Says, you hear this voice in your mind go, "I had my doubts, but, well done."
Orion: Thank you.
Matt: So. That ends that turn. Scanlan, do you want to move at all? Are you going to stay where you are?
Sam: I'm gonna stay where, well, I'm gonna move just a couple feet away from the guy right behind me, and I'm going to, as my bonus action, might as well give Grog some dice. And also just tell everyone, remember, let's not kill the general, we need him for information.
Liam: Probably if anyone tries to hit him, he'll snap out of it, so.
Sam: That's it. I also take a little poo in my pants.
Taliesin: Small kilo.
Sam: This is still-- A battle? Even though. No combatants?
Matt: I mean, if you guys are deciding not to fight anymore, what's your plan?
Marisha: I-- Come on down and I say, good work guys. That was cool, that was great.
Sam: He's under my spell.
Laura: Perhaps we should tie him up.
Marisha: That's what I was gonna say, I cast Grasping Vine and I just take a vine and I tie his hands behind his back. And kind of grapple him.
Sam: So that'll break the spell.
Marisha: Well no, I'm not damaging him, I'm just--
Liam: Hugging him.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Hugging him with vines.
Taliesin: Vine hugs.
Matt: As this is happening, you guys feel a familiar tremble.
Sam: Oh no. Be quiet.
Matt: In the ground.
Liam: DM is out of his mind.
Matt: Everyone make a stealth check. (all laugh)
Marisha: Damn it.
Orion: Oh, that's a 20.
Sam: That is a 20.
Marisha: (whimpers) This is the second time I rolled a one on my stealth check.
Taliesin: Wow.
Marisha: I'm not stealthy today.
Ashley: 17.
Liam: 18.
Laura: 19.
Travis: 14.
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: Pretty good overall.
Orion: Two.
Sam: 22.
Matt: All right. There is the rumble, gets louder and louder, and you can see the duergar looking around nervously. The rumbling kind of fades for a second. And with a cacophonous cracking sound, the stone floor beneath you splits open.
Sam: No!
Matt: Right here.
Liam: (groans)
Matt: Percy, make an acrobatics check and try to avoid whatever is coming through.
Sam: Whatever? It's a dragon!
Taliesin: 18.
Liam: It's a worm.
Matt: All right, you manage to just pull out of the way. As a large--
Laura: What the fuck is that?
Marisha: What is that?
Matt: A large armored four-legged creature comes bursting out of the ground around you.
Orion: Oh great, it's a rock butthole. (all laugh)
Matt: Lets out this horrible screeching growl, has this kind of hungry look in its eyes.
Marisha: Can I reactionary real quick, take my Grasping Vine and just lift him and kind of put him in the corner to keep the general safe?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Orion: Is he rooted?
Matt: He is currently-- Is considered grappled.
Liam: I have a question.
Marisha: I was just trying to keep him safe.
Liam: Can we take a potty break before?
Sam: A potty break? No breaks tonight!
Liam: No breaks?
Marisha: No breaks.
Matt: We're pushing through. You need a bottle.
Marisha: Exercise your kegels.
Matt: If you really need to go, you can. When it's not your turn.
Liam: No, I'm fine.
Sam: Just pee on Ashley, it's okay.
Crew: Suck it up, man.
Matt: As this entity comes burrowing up from underneath the ground, it immediately makes a strike against--
Sam: Guys, this is so exciting. And Laura has no idea what's going on.
Laura: No clue, good times.
Matt: This is gonna be a bite attack against you, Percy. That is, all right, 24 versus armor class.
Travis: Shit, bite is at 24.
Taliesin: Yeah, that-- That hits.
Matt: As you reactively attempt to move out of the way, this creature comes tearing out of the ground. Gets its bearings, rears back, and this giant, toothy maw comes clamping down onto your entire torso. You suffer 36 points of piercing damage.
Sam: Oh!
Taliesin: The fuck?
Marisha: 36?
Matt: 36 points of piercing damage. That's going to end its turn.
Marisha: Shit.
Matt: Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay, well.
Taliesin: That hurt.
Ashley: I'm still prone?
Matt: You are prone, you can use your movement to get back up.
Ashley: Okay, I use my movement to get back up. Do I also get an attack for doing that?
Matt: You still have your action, and your bonus action, it's just your move.
Ashley: Okay. I will use Guiding Bolt, and I'm gonna shoot that thing.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Sam: That's my girlfriend.
Travis: Come on, Pike.
Marisha: Does this guy appear to be messed up by the Daylight at all?
Ashley: Okay. Do I add anything?
Matt: You add your spell attack modifier, it's on your spell sheet. So the top of your spell sheet.
Ashley: Sorry guys. Oh sweet, okay, so. That would be 25.
Matt: That definitely hits. So, Guiding Bolt, what does that do?
Ashley: So I roll, where'd it go, I roll 4d6. I roll 4d6.
Matt: 4d6, go ahead and do that.
Ashley: Yes. 16.
Matt: 16, all right. So you reach back, clutching your holy symbol. You get back off the ground, release your hand as this suddenly flaring blast of divine energy comes cascading out of the front of your palm, blasting into the side of the face, nearly searing one of the eyes of the creature. It rears back, brings one leg up instinctually, (growls) slams the ground in the process-- How you doing? That's disadvantage to your next attack.
Liam: Aw!
Ashley: Wait, what are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 38.
Matt: It lands, puts its foot back on the ground, and kinda gears its attention towards you. It's angling around the room for what should be its next meal. Anything else you wanna do?
Ashley: Can I give him a healing potion? Can I heal him?
Matt: He's too far away. You could use your bonus action if you wanna use Healing Word.
Ashley: Okay, I'll use Healing Word.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll that for him. While you're doing that, brings us-- So Clarota now gets its action.
Marisha: Yeah, Clarota!
Matt: Clarota now looks wide-eyed, seeing this happen. You hear a slight voice in the back of your head go, "This is complicating." As it rears back, you hear the slight echoing, screeching sound, that just manages to skirt the outside of your mental capacity. You feel like if you were any closer, or if it was directed towards you, it would be a horrible ringing pain in your head. You're just peripheral to it. It makes its attack. Unfortunately, the exterior, the bulette, and/or its mind shielding is too strong, it seems to have no effect on the creature.
Sam: Damn it! Clarota, worthless!
Matt: A bulette, is the entity. That ends its turn, top of the round, Vax.
Liam: Okay, I think, where's the laser? Here it is. It looks like I have just enough squares to go one two three. Who's this right here?
Matt: That's a duergar. Weapon on the ground, not armed right now.
Liam: Can I get to here on a turn? I can't tell.
Matt: What's your movement?
Liam: It's 30 feet. I'll use my bonus action to click my haste boots together.
Matt: Okay, then you can definitely do that.
Liam: Okay, and since Percy is right up against it, I'm able to deal Sneak Attack damage, because there's another one of its foes.
Matt: Exactly, yes. You don't get an advantage on the attack, but if you attack, you do it.
Liam: So I'm gonna try to strike him in his underbelly.
Matt: All right. Even the underbelly itself is heavily armored, you have to kind of gauge quickly where the plate is.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20? 20 hits.
Matt: Go ahead and roll with your Sneak Attack damage.
Marisha: So 20 hits?
Liam: Oh, and it was-- Never mind. So three. There we go. 22.
Matt: 22 damage? All righty. Got it. Cool, that brings us to-- The general is going to attempt to make a saving throw.
Sam: Shit. He can do that?
Matt: Every time he gets a turn round, he gets a chance to break out of the-- And he does.
Sam: Oh, he broke out?
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Shrugs off the mental influence of the Dominate spell. However, he is not currently armed. He uses his movement, or action to pick up the war hammer. Fury and anger is in his eyes.
Marisha: He's still grappled.
Sam: No no, he just broke out, right?
Marisha: Oh, from the grapple, too?
Matt: Yeah, he used his whole turn to break out of the grapple and grab its weapon, that's all he can do.
Sam: Where is he?
Matt: Right there.
Liam: To fight the bulette? Or to--
Matt: You have no idea.
Liam: Oh, we don't know, oh. He could just be reacting to the bulette.
Matt: The flames on the hammer are out too. But it picks up the war hammer, it's cold black steel currently.
Travis: We got our Davy Jones in the room, he'll take care of the dwarves.
Matt: That brings us to... Grog.
Travis: (groans) Kitty! I would like to go into a frenzied rage, and charge at Clifford the big red dog. (all alguH)
Matt: You leap off the higher platofrm, come rushing out with your ax in the air, as you come down using the full weight of your body behind the attack, go ahead and roll your three attacks.
Travis: All right, I have nine, eight, 17.
Sam: You have one dice from me. I've inspired you.
Travis: Oh.
Sam: (singing) Grog. Grog.
Travis: Is it a 20 or is it a what?
Matt: You get to add a d8 to an attack roll.
Sam: If you have a shitty attack roll, add a d8 to it, if you have a shitty roll.
Travis: 17.
Orion: Grog, smash right through his plate thingy.
Matt: Barely hits.
Travis: 19.
Matt: Hits, all three attacks hit.
Travis: Yeah, that one hits, 16 plus eight.
Matt: So all three attacks hit, roll damage for three hits. As you come now, just slamming your grey ax, into the side of this armored beast, just over and over again. Cleaving this nice little wide section of its armor on the side.
Liam: Take his fucking head off.
Travis: 14. 21. 21 again.
Ashley: What?
Travis: 22.
Laura: Oh, so. 22, 21, and 14.
Sam: Whoa.
Laura: I was doing his math. (all laugh)
Matt: 21, 22, and 14 you said?
Ashley: 57?
Sam: 57.
Travis: I don't wanna do math and show you all up.
Liam: That's a level nine barbarian.
Matt: So, slam him, you see a portion of its side armor splits, you can see a little bit of that dark red, fleshy interior. You do a significant amount of damage, and leave a nice little weak point in its armor. However, it still doesn't seem to be entirely phased by the damage, it just kinda shrugs at the damage, and kinda glares at you for a second. One of its eyes that was focused on Percy and Keyleth, now looks over at you Jurassic-Park style, with the t-rex up at the side of the vehicle. Vex?
Laura: I back up a little bit. Yeah, like that. And I'm gonna cast Hail of Thorns on him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Sounds nasty.
Laura: Right? I'm gonna shoot like a regular attack.
Matt: So your bonus action to cast Hail of Thorns, and then you attack with the arrow, go for it.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You're adding 11 to it.
Laura: Okay, good, then that'd be 18.
Matt: 18? 18 hits.
Laura: Yes, so I was casting that as a level three spell. I roll 3d-- that means I roll 3d10.
Matt: Against the creature?
Laura: Against 14 which is my spell level thingy.
Travis: 3d10.
Laura: Yeah, 1d10 for damage.
Matt: Yep, go for it.
Laura: That is an eight-sided dice, yay!
Matt: There yougo.
Laura: An eight.
Matt: That'd be 25.
Laura: I get another attack, so I'm gonna do that. Natural 20! (all cheer)
Matt: Nice, all right, go ahead and roll damage, double the dice and add your modifier of seven.
Liam: That arrow just went slow mo.
Laura: Double the dice. 15.
Matt: 15, all right. So what happens here is you pull an arrow out, as you whisper a couple of words under your breath, you see all these thorny spikes being to shoot out the shaft of the arrow. You release it and as it strikes in the front of its face, the arrow actually splinters, sending a bunch of these thorns all over its torso, piercing an inch or two into its armor with each blast of these thorns. It kinda rears back and tries to shake itself off. As it does, you get a little bit of a look as Grog backs away from it, checking to see the wound he left. You take your secondary arrow, aim for the red soft spot, boom, slips right past the armor plating, doing the extra damage on the interior of its physical self. Awesome, that's your turn I believe.
Ashley: Good turn.
Matt: Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay, is my hand still stuck in its mouth? (all laugh)
Taliesin: I would like it to be.
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah, you could've left it there.
Taliesin: Do I have an advantage to hit if my gun is in its mouth? (all laugh)
Matt: You are considered grappled if you leave your hand there. You can remain grappled for advantage on the attack roll.
Taliesin: Done. So I get to roll twice?
Matt: You do.
Marisha: This is a whole new meaning to point-blank.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19, that'll hit.
Taliesin: Okay, I spent some grit on this, and did some interesting modifiers.
Matt: How much grit did you spend?
Taliesin: Two points of grit.
Matt: Okay, this is the--
Taliesin: The Deadshot. And I also took a negative five hit for a plus ten damage to this shot, and I'm using my fire modifier. I'm just being an asshole. (all laugh)
Marisha: That's amazing.
Taliesin: That's... 16 and 20, 35 points of fire damage inside of its mouth.
Matt: So, your hand inside, you pull back and fire, knowing which barrel is next. You hear this dull(muffled explosion) sound, and its eyes kinda pulse for a second, in intense fury and pain, smoke just billows out the sides of its mouth, and its nostrils, and it begins to kind of shake its head, lifting you about a foot off the ground, painfully, but you think it's worth the deal. Well done.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: Aw man.
Matt: I will say that ends your turn.
Liam: Thank you Gary Gygax, wherever you are. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. The duergar, currently seeing the situation, and the change of tone, go and grab their weapons.
Travis: Change of tone. (all laugh)
Travis: Shit got real.
Matt: This duergar is going to move up, back to you, Scanlan, as it sees that you were the one that took over the general.
Sam: Dicks, bring it.
Liam: Dicks.
Matt: This one comes rushing in.
Marisha: Aw, come on.
Liam: Freakin' tank in the room.
Marisha: There's a bigger problem, bro.
Matt: Opportunists, man. It rushes after you, actually.
Liam: ♫ Why can't we be friends
All: ♫ Why can't we be friends
Matt: All right, the attack against you, Scanlan. That is gonna be a 17 versus AC. All right, this one is actually also physically growing in size as it comes towards you.
Sam: It's getting hard. (all laugh)
Matt: You suffer 16 points of damage.
Orion: Such a bummer.
Matt: As the war pick comes slamming into your side. You see it's coming, but you're just not fast enough. It hits you, on impact, it may have cracked a rib, you're not sure. The one that's coming up against you, rolls, that's going to be a 17 versus armor class.
Liam: Fuck you.
Matt: You see it and just duck out of the way, its war pick slams into the stone wall next to you, with a horrible screeching stone sound. High-AC rogue, yo. All right that ends their turn, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: I'm looking in, I'm like, oh, that's no good. I look at where he made the crack in the armor, where is that, is that in the head?
Matt: It's in the head area, right over here.
Orion: Right, awesome. I'm going to kind of motion towards the mind flayer, and give a telepathic wink.
Matt: It is on the ground.
Orion: Yeah.
Sam: Are you flirting with it?
Matt: You make a telepathic wink.
Orion: And I'm going to cast Telekinesis, and I'm going to pry open the metal. I'm not going to target the creature, I'm going to target the armor.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: Interesting thought, okay. See if it-- the 17 is the DC?
Orion: Yes.
Travis: This could be cool.
Matt: All right, it fails. So here's what happens. For the effect of this. It suffers, I'm gonna say it suffers about 2d6 points of damage from the tearing. So go ahead and roll that.
Orion: Six damage.
Matt: So six damage, however, you have effectively reduced its armor class by five.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: In doing so.
Sam: Ooh!
Orion: And I'm going to spend two more sorcery points, and do the spell again. I'm going to do a-- I'm gonna do Firebolt, right in the hole. And I'm going to use my metamagic wand to fire the spell.
Marisha: Fire in the hole!
Matt: All right, go for it!
Sam: He has so many dice, it's crazy.
Orion: Oh, that hits.
Taliesin: Actually, does that crit? Does your 19 crit?
Matt: No. Usually, 20 is only crit, except for, I think he has a bonus ability.
Sam: Critical Role by the way, name of the show. (all laugh)
Matt: It's okay, you're good, and you're a fighter, which means eventually you'll end up with four attacks per round anyway, so you're fine.
Orion: Can't do that.
Taliesin: I'm looking forward to it.
Matt: Damage, what you got? Scanlan, you're on deck, by the way.
Sam: I'm ready.
Orion: I zap him, I zap him for one.
Matt: Okay. (all laugh)
Orion: No, no no no, I empowered it. Full, it takes ten damage. 'Cause I empowered the spell.
Matt: That's correct, so. As you pull down with the ray, it streaks down across the ceiling portion of the building, right into the fleshy, exposed part of its armor, now it looks like it has this giant jagged scar in the side of its head, where you can see muscle and sinew pulsing with each of its movements. You blast into it, you can see this darkened black portion of its interior flesh, it's now charred, slight embers beginning to percolate and burn on the outskirts of the impact. Well done, you gonna stay where you are?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: Scanlan, what you got?
Sam: Okay, I'm going, I know he'll get a hit on me, but I'm gonna run away from the guy behind me, run straight at the general, and just open out my arms in an outstretched big hug, and I'm like, come here big guy, come here! And I give him a big hug, and upon touching him, I cast Banishment on him and send him to another dimension.
Orion: Nice!
Matt: All right. (all laugh)
Matt: As you move away, the duergar is going to attempt to make, as a reaction, to make an attack on you.
Sam: It's okay, it's all cool for Pike.
Matt: That's going to be a 13 versus armor class.
Sam: Does not hit.
Matt: You hear it coming, as you're walking, "buddy!" (all laugh)
Matt: Duck under a war pick.
Matt: With advantage on its saving throw. What's the DC?
Sam: DC?
Matt: The DC on your spell?
Sam: Well, if I'm doing it through my cone, it's 19.
Matt: I will say for this, you do not have it through your cone, because you had your arms open, you didn't specify, however, it still fails it's saving throw. The general, as you reach up, he has his war pick ready. Pulls back its war pick as the flames burst in. (all laugh)
Matt: Then blinks out of existence. (all cheer)
Orion: Nice move.
Ashley: One down, one down.
Sam: Oh, he's gone, oh, where did he go? I don't know.
Matt: How long does it last, by the way?
Sam: It's concentration. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. All right.
Liam: Scanlan Shorthalt, playing Vegas, ladies and gentlemen.
Sam: Do I get a bonus?
Matt: You do get a bonus action.
Sam: Okay, I'm just going to sing a little ditty to Pike, just to give her a little inspiration. I'll just do some pelvic thrusting-- a little (guitar), that's a flute, by the way. (all laugh)
Orion: Super, play that thing.
Matt: His electric flute gives you a d8 inspiration dice, so you can add that to any attack rolls.
Liam: He can do anything with any instrument.
Ashley: Sweet licks on your flute. (all laugh)
Matt: All right, so, Keyleth.
Marisha: So, upon seeing this big thing crash in, and I'm like, oh. Now you're really angry. But I just kind of analyze him and I say okay, and then I go, (grunts), and I turn into a rhinoceros.
All: Ooh!
Matt: Okay, I don't have a rhinoceros mini on me, so we'll use a bear for the time being, but we'll know it's a rhinoceros.
Sam: Why don't you have a rhinoceros?
Matt: 'Cause I was not prepared for such things.
Liam: Way to slack off, Mercer.
Matt: Hey, I'm gonna order a rhinoceros now, you happy? I'm gonna go to Toys R Us.
Taliesin: Get the whole animal collection. Actually got them, the whole set.
Matt: So you transform into a rhinoceros, now basically facing an armored beast with an armored beast.
Marisha: Kaiju battle. (all laugh)
Matt: Whatcha got, whatcha doing?
Marisha: I'm charging him.
Travis: Activity in the Breach.
Matt: You leap down, go in for the attack, this duergar already used its reaction, so it can't attack you.
Marisha: So if he fails to save, I knock him over. That's plus seven, so 19?
Matt: 19 does hit.
Marisha: Awesome!
Matt: Does save though, is not knocked over.
Marisha: A strength save?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Aw, damn it.
Matt: This is a big creature.
Marisha: He does, I do 2d8 of bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Seven, nine, 14 damage.
Matt: 14 damage, all right. You have multi attack or did you get the one hit?
Marisha: Well, I charged, yeah.
Matt: Okay yeah, so the charge is the hit. But you slam into it, your horn gores, you can see actually, you slam it into the side of the armor wound that Grog left and then Tiberius pried open. Part of it gets pulled back, and you see a quick splatter of some sort of bloody splash as you're staring to actually pull apart its interior. The horn is jabbed in there, and it manages to shrug it off at the last point. You do significant gore to its side.
Liam: Good musical riff.
Marisha: Oh, wait. No no no, that's right, keep going. It's actually 15 damage. I always forget that I have a plus one to attack.
Matt: 15? Yeah, don't forget that. You need to remember that. After taking the arrow wound, and after everyone else attacking around it, it's going to try and get a different situation. It's going to jump. It rears back, and leaps into the air.
Sam: Oh jesus.
Matt: Landing right on top of Clarota and Scanlan.
Sam: Oh no!
Ashley: Wait, does he get, do we get--
Matt: You guys all get attacks on it as it jumps away.
Marisha: We all get attacks?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Do I?
Matt: No, you do not.
Marisha: We get advantage, right?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Did he take me, no he didn't take me.
Matt: No, actually, you are still in its hand. In its mouth, it carries you with it.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: Okay, so 19, you hit.
Liam: 24.
Matt: Hit.
Travis: 26.
Matt: Hit. No, it's the three of you, so that's it. So all of you guys just roll damage for a basic attack.
Sam: Come on, kill him before he gets to me.
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24 damage? 24 damage you said? Nice.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Was I close enough to him to get an attack?
Matt: No you weren't, unfortunately.
Liam: 11.
Matt: 11, all righty, and?
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: So, as it lands. All of you guys have to make a strength or dex saving throw, your choice. For Percy.
Taliesin: Dex.
Matt: And Scanlan, and I'm rolling for Clarota. Clarota fails.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: It's okay, it's okay, Scanlan. It's okay, you can do this.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: 20.
Sam: He's coming back from the other dimension. I rolled a nine.
Orion: Did it hit the floor or did you go again?
Sam: No, I used the one that rolled on the floor.
Laura: Roll it on the table, that doesn't count.
Matt: So Clarota is not prone.
Sam: Dungeon Master, does a roll on the floor count? What happened?
Matt: I usually roll on the table. I usually prefer to roll on the table.
Sam: It's even worse. (all laugh)
Liam: That'll learn ya.
Matt: You guys are knocked prone on the ground, and you all take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 14 points of slashing damage. As he just lands on top of you. Yeah, so 28 points of damage, as it crushes you, and its claws sink into you. Clarota takes the same.
Liam: Did it drag Percy through the air?
Taliesin: Yes it did.
Laura: It did?
Taliesin: My arms are still stuck in its mouth.
Matt: You're not knocked prone, but you do take 14 points of crushing damage, as its mouth bites down on your arm again, for free.
Taliesin: That's fine.
Matt: It's going to actually release you, Percy. So you're there.
Marisha: Think your arm might be a bit busted.
Matt: It turns, and makes a bite attack against Scanlan.
Sam: As he does I distract him. (air horn blowing) (all laugh)
Sam: Playing my shawm.
Matt: That's the sound a shawm makes?
Sam: Cutting Words reaction.
Matt: Okay, so as your reaction, go ahead and do that, so roll the d8.
Ashley: (imitates horn)
Travis: It's like the start of a Pitbull song.
Sam: Six.
Matt: Okay, he rolled a 27. Reduced it by seven to 19. So even with the reduction, it's not enough, you're on the ground. It sinks its teeth right into you. You take, let's see.
Liam: These games keep getting better.
Matt: You take 41 points of piercing damage.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Liam: Scanlan!
Sam: No worries, I'm just at negative 36 now. (all laugh)
Marisha: Really?
Sam: Yep.
Matt: Okay, so.
Marisha: Wait, how did that happen?
Taliesin: That happened fast.
Liam: He's unconscious, he's in bad shape, but we're gonna get him.
Matt: Scanlan's looking rough, Scanlan is now just being thrashed around in the mouth of the creature.
Travis: How many hit points do you have?
Matt: His limp arms and legs just (thumping) as it's kind of just running him around and across the air.
Liam: Hashtag save Scanlan. Strings of gnome blood are being flung across the room.
Liam: Oh, he's so little though, he's so little.
Matt: Pike, your turn.
Ashley: Okay, so time for a Cure Wounds. So I guess. Let's see.
Matt: You can't even see him right now. If you want to Cure Wounds, you have to touch him.
Ashley: I'll go, yeah, I'll go.
Sam: I'm being thrashed around.
Ashley: Can I just go, he's over there?
Laura: He's in the mouth of the thing.
Liam: She's 25 speed.
Matt: So you can move five squares.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Didn't you get that speed boost?
Ashley: How close can I get to him? I can't see the lines in the squares.
Orion: Don't forget your boots, Pike.
Ashley: Oh, I have sprinter's boots! I have sprinter's boots. Okay, so I'm gonna use my sprinter's boots. I can-- While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action, and click the boots' heels together, if you do, the boots double your walking speed for one minute.
Matt: So you can move ten squares, takes your bonus action.
Ashley: So then, I'm so sorry, I can't see the squares. So if I can get ten to get over there.
Matt: So you go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, there is a ledge there, and he's blocking the way up, so nine, ten, make an acrobatics check to actually jump and climb up onto the--
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: With disadvantage, 'cause you have plate armor.
Liam: But what about her--
Matt: Disadvantage, you roll twice and take a lower.
Ashley: Wait, wait, hold on. Can I cast Guided Strike? Which adds ten to--
Sam: I gave you a dice. I gave you a dice.
Liam: Which means you're-- Ten.
Matt: Total of ten?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: That's exactly what you needed. (all cheer)
Matt: That was the baseline. You run up, it takes all the strength you can feel, you're gonna be sore in the morning. All your muscles tense as you pull yourself up, with all the inertia from the run, your parkour up to the top, land, Scanlan's there, currently being flung around, you manage to reach up and grab him, and get in a brief tug of war with the bulette creature.
Ashley: Hey, get away from him, man!
Matt: As you cast Cure Wounds. Go ahead and--
Ashley: So that's Mass Cure Wounds, so does that heal--
Matt: Is it Mass Cure Wounds, or just doing Cure Wounds?
Ashley: I'll just do Cure Wounds.
Matt: So at what level are you using?
Sam: Don't chintz out.
Ashley: I'm gonna use it at the highest-- I'll use it at fifth level.
Sam: Cast whatever you can cast.
Liam: It's one or multiple people.
Sam: Can you do it at a higher level?
Ashley: Yeah, I'll do it at my highest level that I can cast, which is--
Sam: Let's not cheap out on Scanlan here.
Ashley: Sorry guys, I'm just warming up again. (all laugh)
Travis: Let's not skimp on Scanlan.
Liam: Remember when I brought you back from the dead? Remember that? Remember that?
Sam: Remember when my kiss healed you from death? Just throwing that out there.
Ashley: -- which I think is eight.
Matt: So it's 5d8 + 5. 5d8 + 5 is how much you're healing him.
Liam: You're gonna be all right.
Ashley: My spell attack bonus, plus eight?
Matt: You don't have to worry about the bonus, you're just touching him.
Ashley: So 5d8 + 5.
Matt: Is what you're healing him, yes. All right.
Sam: That's three.
Liam: I think you did it four times, yeah.
Ashley: 18, plus five.
Sam: I thought that was three, no?
Ashley: Yeah, 23, 23.
Sam: Plus five.
Liam: That was plus five.
Laura: Are you still unconscious?
Sam: But now I'm only negative 11.
Ashley: Wait, what?
Sam: I've taken almost 100 points of damage in this.
Matt: You're unconscious, how it works in this, and this is different from Pathfinder-- Yeah, you go to zero and you stay there. You are now up to 23.
Liam: You don't go below zero, you hit zero, and you're there, making rolls to see if you die.
Laura: You only have three chances if you roll, fail, three times, you die.
Matt: And if something hits you while you're unconscious, it's an automatic fail. Now you're 23 hit points.
Sam: Hey, I feel great, guys! (all laugh)
Matt: You're still in its mouth being shook around.
Sam: Oh shit! (all laugh)
Sam: What is this ride? This is crazy!
Matt: Pike, that's your turn.
Ashley: I can't do anything else, right?
Matt: Clarota's going to get up.
Liam: Come on Clarota, show us what you got.
Matt: Clarota looks pretty rough. Rears back.
Liam: Got to bring that mental power and that arcane magic, let's do it.
Matt: Taking a cue from the opening you left, Clarota pulls back its hand, you see a familiar spark of bluish electrical energy as Clarota reaches for unleashing a torrent of electrical arcane energy forward, into the form of a Lightning Bolt. Blasting across the bow of this giant creature. Let's see. Does not make its saving throw, so it's 32 points of lightning damage.
Laura: Clarota!
Matt: As the back of its armor is now seared, and you can see parts of its armored flesh are kind of blackened and charred and slightly crimping. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, so I've got enough room to run up to its anus, which I'll do.
Travis: As you always do.
Liam: It's got plenty of people around, so that means I can Sneak Attack him.
Matt: As you rush past, before you attack? This duergar that was right by you, that has currently grown to a larger size gets a free swing at you.
Liam: Ain't no thing.
Matt: That's going to be a 21 to hit.
Liam: Okay, that hits.
Matt: All right, with its war pike it takes-- deals 14 points of damage to you.
Liam: Who cares, I'm saving my gnome friend, okay. Here I go. 14, it's a 25 to hit his butt.
Matt: 25 hits.
Liam: This is my keen dagger, with vorpal blade, two plus seven is nine, that's just nine. Where's a pencil, that's a pencil. And then we add my Sneak Attack damage, which is six, seven, ten. 15. 21, plus nine, is 30.
Matt: All right, nice.
Liam: To the butt. Specifically to the butt.
Matt: As you rush up, you take a moment as it's thrashing about, and you can see what looks, anatomy-wise, to be probably where it expels whatever it eats.
Liam: The hole? Right in there.
Matt: You go ahead and just slash and eviscerate there.
Liam: How do you like me now?
Matt: Even back there it's heavily armored, it takes, you carve through, and it-- You've definitely left a lasting impression on this bulette.
Liam: Pucker up, baby, pucker up.
Sam: Hashtag, armored anus. (all laugh)
Travis: What, what, in the butt.
Liam: This is D&D in 2015, people, 2015. So that's the first attack, right? Now I get a second attack?
Matt: The general also, by the way, appears as the concentration spell was lost as you were unconscious.
Sam: I must have stopped concentrating for some reason.
Matt: However, it is right in front of, it's like. It's now in his face.
Liam: Second attack. 22.
Matt: That hits. Okay, and that's a four plus ten, ten points of fire-based damage to the butt.
Matt: All right. (all laugh)
Travis: Preparation H? Fire damage to the anus.
Matt: That brings us to his turn.
Laura: The general's?
Matt: The general's turn, who now is there from the bulette, sees it, looks over and sees you.
Travis: It's right in front of him!
Matt: Kind of sitting there with your bloody hand. It's still flaming, swings back, and goes for your head.
Taliesin: God.
Matt: That is a 23 versus armor class.
Taliesin: Ah, yeah, that's gonna hit. Armor class sucks.
Matt: Plus the fire damage.
Ashley: What are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 39 I wanna say?
Matt: Well, you take 31 points of damage. Including the fire damage from the pike, it goes for its second attack against you.
Travis: This thing sucks.
Matt: That's gonna be a 22 versus armor class.
Taliesin: That's gonna hit.
Liam: It's a tank.
Travis: One.
Matt: You take... That's gonna be 21 points of damage.
Taliesin: I'm out. Okay, Percy being pummeled and pummeled again. Loses, your gun falls from your hand, as you slump to the ground, your eyes roll back, unconsciousness and darkness.
Sam: We're droppin' like flies!
Matt: Taking you. That brings us to--
Ashley: Everybody knows shit's fucked.
Matt: Grog.
Travis: What, me? Bah! How tall is the thing?
Matt: Tall? I'd say it's probably about... 20 feet tall? 15, 20 feet tall?
Travis: Can I climb up on its back?
Matt: It's not your size, it'd be really, really tight, pinning in there.
Travis: I would like to run up to its right side and flank it.
Matt: Over here?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So you run around. Which you can do, 'cause you're a freaking barbarian.
Travis: (snarls)
Matt: All right, go ahead, you're making your attacks. Go for it, three strikes against it.
Travis: 21. Hits, right?
Matt: 21 definitely hits.
Travis: 16 plus eight, hits.
Matt: Definitely hits.
Travis: Natural 20! (all cheer)
Travis: Does that mean I get extra?
Liam: Double damage, it means double damage.
Travis: Oh, double damage, okay.
Matt: So first strike.
Ashley: Kill him, kill him, kill him!
Travis: 16?
Matt: 16 damage?
Travis: Yes.
Laura: 21.
Travis: 21, thank you.
Liam: Stay in school, kids.
Travis: Stay on the table.
Matt: It's the critical now, so double the dice roll.
Travis: 20, thank you, and. 15, plus that, 20.
Matt: You double the dice, then add the modifier.
Travis: Oh, double the second one.
Laura: So that's 40 on the last one.
Sam: Jesus.
Laura: So 61, 76.
Matt: How do you want to do this, Grog? (all cheer)
Ashley: Oh, you killed him?
Liam: Yes!
Matt: How you wanna do this, Grog?
Travis: I would like to chop down into the fleshy bit, and after I've sliced--
Matt: The fleshy bit is on the opposite side, by the way. So you're now at an unarmored side. However, it's still holding Scanlan in its mouth, shaking him around, so, how do you wanna finish it?
Travis: Can I get to its mouth at all?
Matt: I could say for the flavor of this, yeah, you manage to just barely make it over here.
Travis: I would like to swing through and catch the corner of its mouth, open its mouth wide, and then I'd like to reach in, and with my teeth, pull its fucking tongue out of its head, and start thrashing it side to side. (all laugh)
Matt: First you rush up with your ax, using all of the aggression, you take it and swing it, barely leaving you with a shave. You gash the side of its mouth, and draw this giant wound open. As it does, you actually snap, and cut through the tendons that clench the jaw, causing it to fall open and slack. Scanlan spills out of its mouth, hitting the ground with a dull thud. As its mouth is now open, it kind of rears back. You shake your head angrily, as the froth is gathering at the corners of your mouth. You drop your ax from one hand, grab the jaw, reach in, bite down on its giant meaty tongue. Using your hand at the back of it, you pull and yank and you feel the muscle tearing and tensing before, eventually it comes free, and is now dangling about 25, 30 pounds, of very very wet, tongue meat. With your third attack, how do you finish it? (all laugh)
Travis: What do you after you're biting its tongue in your mouth?
Matt: That's what I'm asking.
Travis: That's a good point.
Matt: It's looking really rough, but you still need to get that final death blow. What are you doing with this, Grog?
Ashley: Rip him apart.
Travis: Yeah, I'm gonna King Kong his jaw. I'm gonna take the broken part, the top of his head, and just pull apart.
Matt: Okay, so you drop your ax entirely, the tongue still dangling from your mouth. You reach and put one foot up into the bottom of the jaw, using your other hands you push and push, you hear it crack, and pull, as it tenses and is trying to push down. It has no tension because the jaw was destroyed. You pull back and hear a sickening snap, as the armor plate buckles underneath where the neck joint would be on such a creature. Its eyes kinda roll back for a second, and it begins to slacken. As it does, you reach up with your fist, and penetrate the bottom of where its brain would be. With a sickening (suction) sound, it goes entirely limp and collapses on the ground.
Liam: And that's why you're on the team. (all cheer)
Travis: And as it falls, the tongue that's hanging in my mouth, I look to one of the dwarves that's left, I go, who's next? (all laugh)
Matt: We're gonna end it there for the night. (all groan)
Matt: Damn guys, well done.
Taliesin: I'm sleeping.
Sam: Oh, Percy's dead, hashtag save Percy.
Laura: I want more chicken.
Matt: Before we finish, I'd say go ahead and throw a heal up on him.
Marisha: Oh yeah.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Ashley: Good plan.
Matt: It's nasty, man. You guys picked that, by the way.
Laura: Oh seriously?
Travis: They did? You dicks!
Taliesin: You suck.
Zac: That was the chat room.
Orion: Try harder next time.
Matt: We'll be doing more of those as time goes on. Not all the time, but whenever I have the opportunity to put it in there, I'm gonna start asking for you guys to help me figure out what to throw at these adventurers.
Liam: You sadists. (all laugh)
Zac: We shouldn't tell them the other options, should we, just in case we wanna save them.
Matt: Oh no, they'll come back in, don't worry.
Ashley: 25.
Taliesin: Oh wow, I feel much better.
Zac: So you guys, we're gonna be doing a Q and A.
Matt: Yeah, for anyone who wants to stay over.
Zac: Anyone who wants to stick around, the audience has a ton of questions for you guys. For the audience, it's a sub-only Q and A, so if you're been wondering whether or not you should sub, let me give you some reasons why. Number one, you can ask these guys questions in a little bit. Number two, every 50 subs, we're giving away tabletop promo kits that are like $250 worth of special stuff, and we will ship that internationally, doesn't matter. Even in Antarctica. We want someone in Antarctica to do tabletop day, do you know anyone?
Matt: I don't.
Zac: We had someone last year.
Matt: Well shit, we gotta reach out then.
Zac: They're gone, they were like the only people there, and they're gone.
Matt: There's nobody there left, they were the last bastion. Well, somebody needs to move to Antarctica in the next few days and let us know, so then we can totally use that.
Zac: We also do a Minecraft server, for subs only, but if you want in on that, there's no automated message for that server info, so just make sure and message the Geek & Sundry account, and we'll get you that sub IP address for the Minecraft server. I know we have more, there's lots more stuff. We do some other sub-only chats throughout the week. lots of emotes, other fun stuff. But we're gonna go ahead and roll some videos while we get set up for the Q and A. This was a lot of fun, oh! I would like to challenge you guys to do a quick little donation drive for the charity that you guys support.
Matt: Yeah, for 826LA. Had it going up in the chat room, if you have the opportunity, you wanna help support these children getting side educations and tutoring.
Zac: You guys wanna tell them about, just to get them psyched up for it? 'Cause we can get that command going.
Marisha: Yeah, 826LA, they're a non-profit organization that helps primarily with literacy and creative story children for children between the ages of like five and 18. They have a really great young authors book that you can buy that's a collection of all of the kids' book, and you can also go and check out the time travel mart, there's one in Echo Park and then there's also one in Marina Del Rey. But you should just google 826, 'cause I know there's one in Seattle, I know there's one in like Atlanta. New York, San Francisco. There might be an 826 in your city.
Liam: 826LA probably, right?
Marisha: 826LA is who we're raising money for. But yeah all of the 826 store fronts are a little bit different, depending on where you go. They're super cool.
Matt: Guys, please, check it out, it's awesome. It's a good group of people, what they do is fantastic. If you have the opportunity please do, go ahead and donate to the charity.
Matt: Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in for the fourth episode of Critical Role, with the grand return of Pike, our cleric. (all laugh)
Matt: Necessary. Glad to have you back, I'm sure everyone here is glad to have the healer back.
Laura: Especially today.
Taliesin: Very happy today.
Matt: And a surprise return of Laura, so.
Laura: What a time to join the game.
Matt: Heck yeah. All right guys, well, we're gonna take a little bit to set up for the Q and A. Those who can stay, feel free to, those who can't, totally understand. We have kids and families to get to. Those who can will be here for the Q and A for the next hour or so.
Zac: One more thing, just so they know we're following through. We have the picture for you guys to sign. So Niareth won this, when we reached 1,000 subs, so I think Pike is all that's left for that.
Matt: Pike is left to sign this Player's Handbook.
Sam: I haven't signed it.
Zac: And then we've got the picture. So we'll pass that around while we're doing the set up.
Matt: Do any of you have the gold marker?
Zac: I'll find it.
Matt: All right, cool. Yeah guys we're gonna go ahead and set up for this, we'll see you in a little bit for the Q and A, thank you everyone for watching. Thanks guys. Awesome day at Critical Role, thanks.
Ashley: Bye!
Wil: Hey nerds, I'm Wil Wheaton, I know right? And guess what? It is back. International Tabletop Day has returned, this year on April 11th. What is that, you say? What is Tabletop Day? Well, if you don't know, then shame on you. International Tabletop Day is a worldwide celebration dedicated to the tabletop games we love to play with the people we love. People we like, people we've never even met before, it doesn't matter, last year we had over 3,000 registered events across seven continents and over 80 countries, that is amazing! But this year we're going to make it even bigger. "Will Wheaton, how can we make it even bigger than last year?" That's what she said. Start now. Trend #TabletopDay on Twitter, because that was awesome. Broadcast your plans on the internet, make a video, share pictures, start a blog, create a dating profile for other sexy gamers in your area, whatever you want. Celebrate it in your own way, but we wanna hear from you. Be sure to use #TabletopDay, or @TabletopDay to let us know. It is up to you, world. Visit TabletopDay.com to register your event, or find one near you. You can also download exclusive content and check out some of our favorite games. We will be streaming our own live event, here in Los Angeles for you to watch. And there will be more on that soon. You love tabletop games, and we love you, so join us in the global celebration, on April 11th. Play more games. Hey everybody, I'm Wil Wheaton, and I am coming to you semi-live from the Twitch TV set here at the Geek & Sundry stages in beautiful downtown Burbank, California. I am here to tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Tabletop's RPG show, coming this June, but were afraid to ask. Or have been asking for close to a year and I've been saying, "We'll tell you at some point in the future." You can consider this the big announcement. It was incredibly difficult to cast this show. We needed people who were very comfortable improvising, who had experience playing role playing games, and who were available when we planned to shoot the show. It was surprisingly difficult to get a pool of people who fit all of those criteria, and choose the most awesome among them. So your cast playing in this wonderful show are: Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Bailey, Hank Green, and Alison Haislip. I'm really excited to have these people all together. They're all my friends, they are all wonderful storytellers, and they are going to be a tremendous party of adventurers. I'm only gonna try to kill them a little bit. The most frequently asked question since I announced that there was going to be a Tabletop RPG show is, hey Wil Wheaton! Why are you so awesome? The second most frequently asked question is, what system are you using to power this game? First and foremost, I needed a system that was going to support the way I play roleplaying games, and that is telling a story collaboratively with a group of players with me as the GM. I looked at some very well known systems like Dungeons & Dragons, and Savage Worlds, I looked at systems that I love, like Fate Core, and I even looked at the True 20, a d20 modern system. And I really wanted to use something that was released by an independent publisher. I wanted to bring something to the forefront of the roleplaying world that maybe not as many people are familiar with as I want them to be. But I wanna play the way that I played when I was falling in love with roleplaying games when I was a kid. I wanna be able to sit around on a couch and some chairs with my friends, not have to worry about a map on a table in front of us, and just work together to use our imaginations to tell a story. But there's a system that I really love that's elegant, it's easy to learn, it's easy to teach, it's very easy to understand, and it really just gets out of the way when you want to tell a story together. And that is the Adventure Game Engine that Green Ronin Publishing used to drive the Dragon Age tabletop roleplaying game. I asked the developer three years ago to please make generic, so that we can build a setting and put on top of it. They said actually this is something we really wanna do. And it's come together. We have been able to work together with Green Ronin to develop the fantasy Adventure Game Engine. This is gonna take a lot of the things you know from the Dragon Age RPG, and put it all together to support our world, which I have had the best time creating. I sat down three months ago with some amazing writers, and just started brainstorming about what kind of world we wanted to explore. But what I kept coming back to is, I love science fiction, and I love fantasy. Why not put them together? Why not build a world that is inspired by the 1978 Heavy Metal movie, and 1980's amazing Saturday morning cartoon show, Thundarr the Barbarian. I thought it would be great for characters to encounter goblinoid kind of creatures, and instead of them using crossbows, they're using laser rifles. I've got it all worked out, we have a huge team of writers that put all this together that built an amazing codex that gave terrific logic to all of these decisions that we made. We're not gonna tell you what they are. You may discover some of them during the course of the season. So what is the name of this incredible world? The title of our show is Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana. You can sort of come up with your own ideas about what those words mean. I know, but I'm not telling. 'Cause that's not how the Wheaton talks. Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana will premiere right here at Geekandsundry.com on June 2nd. For those of you not in America, Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana will premiere right here on Geek & Sundry on two June. So I hope that you're as excited about this as I am, and I hope that you will tune in, and then watch us for ten straight weeks of incredible high adventure story telling, and until then, play more games.
Ivan: Hey guys, Ivan here, the host of Game the Game, on Geek & Sundry's new Twitch channel. I'm here with Becca, Ify, and Hector, to get you excited about International Tabletop Day. So International Tabletop Day is going to be on April 11th, and all of our friends at AEG have brought us an amazing edition of Love Letter in order to play with you today. That's right nerds. It's Batman Love Letter. Now Batman Love Letter is a game of logic, deduction, and risk, in which you try to capture or hold the highest value card in your hand by the end of the rounds. In the meantime we'll all be playing cards in order to eliminate each other. But whoever has the highest-value card at the end of the round will win a token. So who will be the greatest detective in all of Gotham? It's gonna be Batman.
Becca: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it'll be Poison Ivy.
Ify: You guys both are wrong, it's going to be Bane.
Hector: It's probably not gonna be Robin. (all laugh)
Ivan: Now, normally we will play until seven tokens, but for the purposes of this video, we'll play until three. Whoever gets three is gonna win. Let's play. Pass out your cards Becca, one to each.
Becca: Burn the first?
Ivan: Burn the first. You have to burn a card before you even begin, because there is a mystery card that isn't in play normally. So keep that in mind when you're playing.
Hector: Burning a card, who are we playing with? The Batman villain Firefly? (all laugh)
Ify: Leave the jokes to me, Robin.
Hector: All right, fine.
Ify: Just so you know, I'm doing a set at the comedy store, and I need three friends to show up.
Hector: What night is it? I'm busy that night.
Ify: I didn't even give you the time yet.
Ivan: Hector, why don't you go first?
Hector: Robin.
Ivan: Robin, the man wonder.
Hector: Okay, here we go. I'm gonna play Robin. I've got protection for my entire next round.
Ivan: Right. So every single time you play a card, normally it has an action that is attached to it. So I'm playing Catwoman, who allows me to look at another player's hand. Poison Ivy? Noted. Now it's your turn.
Becca: It's my turn, so I draw a card. I'm gonna hang on to that one, maybe. And I also play Catwoman. And I'm going to look at Bane's hand. That's terrible.
Ify: You make fun of me but you lack the understanding of my strategy. I will play the Batman. I can't guess Robin's because he has immunity, but I can guess Poison Ivy's.
Ivan: If he can guess correctly, not only does he get a token, but she's eliminated from the round, and now there's only three of us available. So it's one step closer to victory. What's your guess?
Ify: My guess is Two-Face.
Becca: Incorrect.
Ivan: Robin?
Hector: Thanks, Batman. All right, here we go. I'm also gonna play Batman. I'm gonna guess that Poison Ivy has the Joker card.
Becca: Incorrect.
Hector: Darn it. Jiminey Jillickers.
Becca: Now you have to do something terribly embarrassing, right? Or is that just Half Scrolls?
Hector: Like maybe wear a Robin costume, cool, sounds good. Oh, already doing it, great. So great.
Ivan: I have two cards and I'm going to also play the Batman. You've been picked on a lot, Poison Ivy.
Becca: I've been picked on so much.
Ivan: You played a Batman.
Hector: Get him Batman.
Ivan: I'm gonna guess you've got a Poison Ivy.
Ify: You're wrong!
Ivan: (groans)
Ify: No survivors!
Ivan: (laughs) All right, I'm done, go ahead, Poison Ivy.
Becca: If anyone's wondering why so many Batman cards are being drawn, it's because there are five in the deck. There's either one or two of all the other characters. So I draw, and I will play, myself, Poison Ivy. This card says, choose any player including yourself to discard his or her hand, and draw a new card. Ivan, you look pretty confident. Discard.
Ivan: Discard, all right.
Becca: And draw a new hand.
Ivan: Had a Two-Face.
Ify: It's time for me to draw.
Ivan: I have a hard time thinking that we're gonna get anything out of you in that mask.
Ify: Oh, you'll see.
Becca: I'm sorry, what?
Ify: You'll see.
Becca: What did he say?
Ivan: I think it's something about seals?
Becca: Did you need help opening a seal?
Ify: I'll play the Batman, and I will guess Becca again, she has the Harley Quinn.
Becca: Incorrect.
Hector: Geez, we're terrible at this game.
Ivan: We're really, really bad.
Becca: I'm great at it.
Ify: Sooner or later.
Ivan: He's in there, or he's there. Not there, there. Not there, there.
Becca: There?
Ivan: There.
Becca: Where?
Hector: I'm going to play my own version of Bane. That was terrible.
Becca: You don't have the mask.
Hector: Myself and another player can secretly compare hands, and whichever hand is lowest is out. So I'm gunning for you, Poison Ivy. Because you kissed me that one time, and then you didn't wanna hang out with me afterwards, like that was really mean, so.
Becca: I had ulterior motives.
Ivan: I'm not looking, Batman's not looking.
Becca: I'm out of the game.
Hector: You're out, yes!
Becca: I had myself again.
Ivan: Which means you have a higher numbered card.
Hector: Yes, that is correct.
Ivan: Higher than five.
Hector: Good detective work, Batman. Real genius, this one.
Ivan: All right. This is the last card of the deck, which means after this, whoever has the highest card, wins.
Hector: Duh, Batman, we know, God.
Ivan: I'm playing Robin, Robin. All right?
Becca: That makes me think he has the Joker.
Ivan: Well, we'll find out won't we? What do you got?
Ify: I had myself.
Hector: Boom, Harley Quinn beats Bane.
Ivan: And the Joker beats Harley Quinn.
Hector: Darn it.
Ivan: I got you, Joker.
Becca: Take your token.
Ivan: I will take my narcissistic token that has my symbol on it.
Hector: This is just what Batman needed, an ego boost. Batman needed an ego boost, great.
Ify: Robin.
Becca: The deb chef, the deb chef.
Hector: You seem to live with a multi billionaire, yet can't afford contacts. What's the deal with that?
Becca: No burn card, no burn card.
Ivan: Oh, great. So since I won the last round, I get to play first, because I am the greatest detective. And I got a Catwoman, which means I think I'm interested in Bane's hand. Whatcha got, Bane? You got crap, is what he's got.
Becca: Choose any player including yourself to discard his or her hand and draw a new card. Hector, burn your card.
Hector: You got it, but it's Robin, and I'm not gonna tell you again. All right, I had Batman, which is cool, because he's the least value card in the game, so that's just gonna help me out, so I'm just gonna grab a new card.
Ify: All right, I'm going to draw. Draw a card. Oof, oof, oof, such a good card.
Ivan: Who are you gonna use it on, Bane?
Becca: It's probably Batman.
Ify: I'm gonna do a Batman card. Robin, do you have Poison Ivy?
Hector: (laughs) No.
Ify: My turn is over.
Hector: All right, it's my turn. Dick Grayson and Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, Carrie Kelley, John Blake, help me. Okay, here we go. My girl Selina Kyle, Catwoman, bam. And I wanna look at Bane's hand. Show me back here buddy, show me back here, whatcha got?
Ify: Got this.
Hector: Okay, good to know.
Ivan: All right. I'm going to just play my ward Robin.
Hector: You're welcome.
Ivan: Grant me immunity.
Becca: Batman. I'm gonna guess that Bane has Poison Ivy.
Ify: You're wrong!
Becca: You'll never have Poison Ivy.
Ify: I'll use Catwoman.
Becca: To look at another player's hands.
Hector: Pause for error.
Ify: I will look at Poison Ivy's hand.
Hector: Don't do it Bane, don't fall into that venus fly trap. Get it, 'cause it's a trap, 'cause it's. It's a plant based pun.
Ivan: Good job.
Ify: Ah.
Ivan: There it is.
Ify: Ah. Ah!
Ivan: Robin, Robin go ahead.
Hector: Okay, here we go.
Ivan: What's it gonna be?
Hector: I'm gonna play Batman. And I'm gonna guess that Bane Has a Batman card.
Ify: You are wrong.
Ivan: For once he doesn't have a Batman card.
Ify: I want to point out to the watchers. Hector looked at my hand.
Hector: Oh I did, that's true.
Ify: And saw me play the card. He knew exactly which card was in my hand. And chose the wrong card.
Ivan: This is why you're the boy wonder, and not Batman.
Hector: I'd like to point out, that my chest has made me very uncomfortable, and I'm clearly out of my element, and dressing me up as Robin was a good call everybody, good call everyone. Good call guys. Wow.
Ify: I really thought that was game over for me. I was wrong.
Hector: Oh my God. Your annoying voice has really gotten into my head.
Becca: That's his greatest power.
Ivan: I also have the Batman. So we know he doesn't have a Batman, you know what it is. Thanks Robin. Useless. So I'm gonna guess that Bane has Harley Quinn.
Ify: You are wrong!
Ivan: Damn. I tried. All the clues are there, just one missing element.
Becca: I played Batman, I'm going to guess that Bane has Two-Face.
Ify: You are wrong as well.
Ivan: He has the Joker then, or something. How can you throw that many Batmans at a single man, and not get what he's got in his hand.
Hector: He really did break you, he really did. And now I'm Nightwing, great, that's how long that took.
Ify: I'm going to say. Two-Face can trade hands with Becca.
Becca: (sighs)
Ivan: That's where it was. Robin?
Hector: It's my turn.
Ivan: Diddly fingers.
Hector: You guys think you're gonna win this? You don't know Dick. Greyson, because that's my real name. I'm gonna play Bane.
Becca: Bane-in it up.
Ivan: What's up, who's gonna compare?
Hector: It's gonna be you, Batman. Let's see what you got, old chum. Oh hoh, bye, you're out. (laughs)
Ivan: Batman card, so. Batman's out.
Becca: Batman's the worst.
Hector: Oh my gosh.
Ivan: How's it feel to knock a man down from his tower?
Hector: It feels great.
Ivan: Right, okay.
Hector: How's it feel for not giving me--
Marisha: Great for my back.
Zac: We're live.
Matt: What's up everyone, we got this camera right here in the middle, right?
Ashley: Hello.
Liam: Oh, hi.
Matt: Thank you guys for watching. Hope you enjoyed yourselves. These guys all being crazy players, and kicking ass, and occasionally getting knocked unconscious, and nearly eaten.
Zac: Any mods want to put this in sub mode for us? Let's do sub mode.
Marisha: So you have to sub. Bye everybody who's not a sub.
Ashley: Bye!
Zac: They can still watch, they just can't ask questions.
Orion: Oh. Okay.
Marisha: Well, your word is not important.
Liam: Laura had to bugger out.
Ashley: Wait, is that a little icon of you?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: What?
Orion: Yeah, he's an emoji now.
Ashley: You're an emoji?
Matt: It's weird.
Taliesin: He's made it.
Ashley: You've made it.
Matt: All right, so how are we doing the questions? Are we just picking as we go?
Zac: You can moderate yourselves.
Ashley: Laura and Sam did leave.
Matt: Unfortunately.
Ashley: Laura had to go to a thing, and Sam had to go to a thing.
Matt: Sam's thing is kids. Sam has two kids. Liam has two kids, but he--
Ashley: Hey look at-- (all laugh)
Matt: I am so sorry, everyone.
Liam: I mean he's pretty good at Dungeon Mastering, right?
Ashley: Yeah, he's pretty good.
Orion: Someone asked what alignment we are. First question, what alignment are our characters?
Marisha: We're all good.
Liam: Chaotic good.
Ashley: Chaotic good.
Orion: Tiberius is chaotic good.
Travis: Chaotic neutral, bitches.
Liam: What was your first roleplaying experience? I saw that go through.
Taliesin: GURPS in high school.
All: GURPS.
Matt: The second edition of Dungeons & Dragons in high school.
Travis: This.
Ashley: Was my first, yeah.
Liam: This guy just started. I did AD&D in high school, and I DM'ed while playing, which is totally cheating. This is the first pure experience I've had.
Orion: This is my first campaign also. I was a Magic the Gathering fan.
Marisha: I actually had Matt as my first DM, way before All this started. So I played a few other games, and then, now I'm back to the OG master.
Liam: I saw, when and how did you all start playing together? The reason this started is because, I directed Matt as Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil 6, and every time he came in he would say, "hey, you know, I'm running a game, you can come in and just do a one off." And I was like, "oh, I got babies, I can't do that, I can't do that, I can't do that." And then finally once for my birthday I thought, I can do a one off, it'll be the only time we'll do it, just see how it goes. Scanlan and I did a podcast together, and every week we would do some new thing, and we're like fuck it, let's play D&D. We all did it and everybody got snake bit, and it's been the best thing that ever happened. To me at least.
Ashley: Yup.
Orion: Our character alignments do matter on how we play the characters, an earlier question.
Matt: Yeah, they do definitely matter. A couple quick answers here. The conversion from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition was decided because, as we're going on to this show, and we had so many players, combat tends to get bogged down, and a lot of floating modifiers in Pathfinder. For large groups like this it's difficult to keep it flowing and moving. I felt once I had taken a look at Fifth Edition, that the combat system was a little more simplified, and a little easier to make freeform and just roll with it. So that was a much better decision. Plus Dungeons & Dragons generally has a better name recognition than Pathfinder, so when you're putting a show out there, it's probably easier to do with very minimal transition, it took a little bit of customizing, like for Percy's gunslinger. We just had to customize it, we made it ourselves. We sat down.
Taliesin: Took a day.
Matt: Took a day, and we worked out, some of the stuff we wanted to keep, some of the things that didn't break it, we wanted to make it interesting. It is a martial archetype for the fighter class. So it does give the bonus a fighter class does. Nothing is too overpowered about it, other than just having custom weapons, and some cool grit-based abilities that we kinda transferred over from Pathfinder. It's interesting. It's a good challenge to see how it works out.
Taliesin: It is, it's working out. I'm digging it. I keep reading and finding things I'm not doing that could be more interesting, so.
Matt: Keeping your hand and firing into the mouth of a bulette is fun.
Taliesin: That felt great.
Liam: Travis, everybody's asking about your shirt.
Travis: Oh. I think it's a website called redbubble.com? I just googled Grog, and there was that.
Taliesin: Just google Grog.
Travis: I needed it right away. Right, right.
Liam: I'm also seeing, why did we switch from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition?
Matt: I answered that a second ago.
Liam: Oh, you did?
Matt: Yeah, the idea being that the reason we switched was it was easier for large-scale combat, and the system was a little more simplified, and I felt for such a large party it'd be easier to do. Plus character creation for any guests we have in the future, so that was the main reason. I love Pathfinder, but at this size, it's good. Answering your earlier question too, I saw someone ask, a good party size. Legitimately, my preference is between four and six players. This works because they're amazing players, and because we keep it very freeform, and not getting bogged down in minutia too often. The four to six players I think is a good sweet spot.
Marisha: I see, does Keyleth have limitations on what animals she can transform into? Yeah, for the most part I can only transform into beasts and I have to be under a certain challenge rating. So right now, at my level, I can only turn into beasts that are a challenge reading of three or lower.
Matt: A third of your druid level, right?
Marisha: Yeah, a third of my druid level which is nine right now. But for the most part I can change into almost anything as long as it's under a challenge rating of three.
Matt: Pike, how do you feel about Scanlan? Do you return his affections?
Ashley: Oh, well. I'm on the fence about him. He's really pretty great, but I don't know. I'm not really sold yet.
Marisha: You know Pike, I feel like we haven't actually girl talked about this.
Ashley: I know, we never girl talked about it.
Marisha: We should.
Ashley: I know, we should talk. I just, I really like him, I think he's really funny. I really the fact that he's a musician, but.
Marisha: That's hot.
Ashley: I don't know, I'm not really sold on him yet.
Marisha: I'm just concerned if he could treat you well.
Ashley: Oh no, you know what?
Marisha: He's got bad habits.
Ashley: He likes to frequent brothels and things like that, which, you know. I'd wanna give him his freedom and his space. I don't know if I'm into it.
Taliesin: If I say it so you can understand it, what's the point?
Liam: Someone's asking if we like presents. I think we'd all like fan art.
Matt: Fan art's awesome, we love it.
Liam: Immortalize our shitheadedness, that'd be good.
Marisha: Oh, it's true.
Ashley: Another couple people on there were asking about my ears. And I really like supporting small businesses. And there's a store on Etsy called Tiny Tangerines, and she makes these by hand. And makes like deer, and bears, she makes a ton of stuff.
Matt: That's really cute.
Ashley: Check her out.
Liam: We still got that little one. Socrates asked what was a favorite moment before we started streaming the show? Our first game was pretty amazing.
Marisha: Our first game was great, I've got some good memories from that one.
Liam: Most of us, I was giggling uncontrollably, I couldn't believe we were doing it. And just watching my friends, who I work with all the time, just dropping into character, there was no like, oh, let's see, what will I do, what am I doing? I will move, I will roll. Like Bailey, Bailey dropped into character from the get-go, and was a ringer. But the moment I was thinking of was when Pike died. Pike died.
Matt: Like died died.
Liam: Shortly before we switched from private to public. It was emotional. A couple people started crying, I teared up. We put two and a half years into this, and we're all very connected to it. I'm not gonna get into it, but I've had a hard couple of years personally, everything's fine, but this was like therapy for me. And to see one of my friends go down?
Ashley: It was sad.
Liam: It was fucking emotional.
Marisha: I don't think a few people were crying, I think everyone was crying.
Orion: I was crying.
Ashley: I was definitely crying. I was like, "no, I love doing this so much!" I don't wanna, I mean, when you spend that much time with people, over two and a half years, you get so attached, and attached to characters.
Marisha: We know these characters almost as well as we know each other now.
Matt: Factoids, the tower you made for us in Minecraft is awesome. Seriously, well done, look at the pictures, it's great, we're gonna have to actually go through it.
Marisha: Wait, we have a tower?
Matt: A guy built an entire tower for the group.
Ashley: No way!
Marisha: They built a castle Greyskull?
Matt: Essentially, on the Geek & Sundry Minecraft server. No. Wait no I did see that! It was huge.
Zac: It towers over the entire --
Liam: Of what?
Matt: Of him! Someone made a sculpture of--. Did you make that or somebody else? You made that?
Zac: Oh no.
Matt: Okay, somebody else made it for you.
Liam: Do we have $50 in the budget to go on eBay and get a Castle of Greyskull set? Put it on the set somewhere? Let's do that.
Matt: There we go. I see a couple quick questions.
Orion: To answer your question, there is an origin of Tiberius, fully written. I won't say it all right now, but he comes from a political family, and there's a whole bunch of layers to him. He is a thought-out character. The buffoonery is half-planned.
Marisha: I mean, we're all really deep, thought out characters.
Orion: Well, they asked if I actually thought out a story for him. He does have a thing for this character named Allura.
Matt: Yeah, Arcanist Allura, the one that actually sent them on this mission, he has kind of a thing for.
Orion: She's super awesome. Hot, I think she's hot.
Matt: She's pretty hot.
Ashley: Super hot.
Matt: The gunslinger class info, I actually posted on Twitter a few days ago, it's in my dropbox if you look through my Twitter. It's on there, otherwise, we'll probably put it up on the website, when all the website stuff is up there. I'm happy to release it now. It's pretty balanced, it's fun. Might have some tweaks down the road, depending on how things play out. You should go to my Twitter, you'll find it there.
Travis: We're gonna have a website with all our characters.
Liam: Yeah, we're working towards that.
Matt: Working on it, yeah. Like a lot of things right now, it's a work in progress.
Liam: Someone asked what kind of food would everyone like?
Orion: Ooh, like Thai food.
Liam: I like Indian.
Matt: Ooh, Indian is good.
Ashley: I really noticed--
Zac: Let them know not to order food.
Liam: Don't, that's a terrible idea.
Orion: We just had a bunch of chicken.
Marisha: Oh you mean like right now? Yeah, don't do it right now.
Zac: If you tell them what you want, all of a sudden I'll get a call, like, "your food is on the way!"
Marisha: Yeah, no, not right now, maybe next week.
Travis: Matt, you're going to Wizard World in Philly. But we will not be joining because we don't own a private fucking plane.
Marisha: But I'll be there. Is anybody else gonna be there?
Travis: Oh really?
Marisha: We'll be there.
Liam: Somebody asked something, like, what do we hope is the result of this show? I can't remember the wording. Obviously we're doing this because we love each other and we're having fun together, but I also hope, D&D has been, its entire history has been like, "oh, it's this weird thing that guys do with dice in a room." Anyone can do this, I love video games, I work in video games, but D&D has changed my life. It is social, it is person to person, it is real, because it's people in a room doing shit together, and that's kind of lacking a little bit in our world, and I would say find some friends. I mean, I love that there are sort of online tools to play with people across the country, but if you can find three or four people in your town to do this, I'd say do it. Do it.
Travis: Yeah, do it.
Marisha: There's something really amazing about the fact that we're all essentially kind of building and communally developing a story together, and that's something that not a whole lot of things can grant you, and we don't really get in today's society much. We're all kinda creating this as a thing. And I think it's good that we're like, hey, this is socially acceptable. D&D's cool, everyone should play D&D.
Matt: Actually, the IT Crowd episode of D&D is one of the best on camera examples of a D&D game night thing.
Orion: That is an awesome episode.
Matt: Fucking hilarious, and a great, truncated version of this is kinda what the game is. So good on you.
Orion: Cut to them weeping.
Taliesin: So many questions going so quickly.
Matt: I know.
Ashley: I want a Grog shirt that says "do it."
Taliesin: And the kitty shirts were an accident. This was not planned.
Marisha: Oh yeah, our kitty shirts.
Liam: Someone's saying what edition to start with? I would start with the most recent, because you know they're gonna keep updating it over the years.
Matt: Fifth is great, Fifth is a great entry point.
Liam: It's really loose. I feel like all of us felt like, we were doing Pathfinder, and... Fucking loved it, otherwise we wouldn't be doing it, but it was really intricate, and we were doing it every six or seven weeks, when we were off-air, so. We felt like the rules were really complicated and we'd lose track of it. We loved doing it, obviously, but Fifth Edition is really fast and loose. I recommend that. And Travis just stuck his finger in my ear, he kinda does that. He hits me in the nads a lot.
Matt: This is a homebrew campaign. I wrote it all just kind of for the hell of it. Custom, don't really base it on anything existing. I feel like I'm playing more in that world, and I always hate the idea of, in the middle of DMing, having to go to a module, or having to look for a rule that wasn't my own. It feels more detached. There are modules that are great, and I've run great modules, but for me personally, with the pacing, and the flow of the game, I prefer to do homebrew.
Liam: Connected to that, someone asked, if you had any tips, and I'd like to know the answer to this too, because I'm running a game for my eight-year-old son and his friends who are about to start, do you have any tips for new DM's?
Matt: Yes. Let's see. I could do a whole panel on that. Tips for new DMs. Preparation is important. You wanna outline cities, come up with ideas for NPCs, that you think would be essential to a story, or like people that really run elements of the town. Simple notes can be like, they're this race, this is their disposition, if you have a particular voice you wanna try for, make a note of this kind of voice. So whenever you come back to them you have a reminder. And spend a lot of time building that structure, you don't have to be too detailed. Always leave room to play in the world, because you never know what your players are gonna do. Be prepared to improv. I prefer loose preparation, and then just kinda rolling where the players take you.
Liam: Although you wrote a monologue for Clarence, right? Because that was very intricate. We were all just ready--
Ashley: Yeah, there's no way you just thought that up.
Matt: There are certain elements, part of the notes I take is for certain NPCs I'll write down key information that they know, and depending on how you ask them, what you say to them, and what you try and extract from them, they might give you some of the information, they might not, if you coerce them, or intimidate them. Or if they're willing to give up the information, I have all that written down. So for that information today, you guys were asking him, and since you allied with Clarence, he was willing to discuss with you. So I had all that prewritten, but depending on how much you said, it was what you guys asked.
Liam: Do you have random encounters ready, in case we're like, "ah, fuck it, I don't wanna go down to the dungeon, I wanna go back up and beat up some dwarves." Do you have shit kind of ready?
Matt: Yep. I have a stack of different creature and encounters already prebuilt, based on what you guys may encounter. Tonight was an example of players being able to pick what happened. But also it's one of those things where it depended, I don't know where you guys are gonna go. I present a story, I present an idea of a general throughline, but how you guys go from point A to point B, that's entirely up to you. Sometimes that can be a very long, meandering line, sometimes it could be a direct ray, so.
Travis: There was a question, how much do you improvise, and when is it appropriate to improvise?
Matt: A lot, and always.
Marisha: Always, yeah.
Travis: The answer is yes.
Matt: I've had whole games where I've prepared a session, and none of it happened, because people just put an entirely wrong direction. Not wrong, but a different direction. So the whole game was just me pulling everything out of my ass.
Marisha: Like that time we walked through the back door of the Thieves' Guild, that was fun.
Matt: Yeah, there was that.
Marisha: What's up, Thieves' Guild. 'Sup.
Orion: Donkey Kong, Pikachu.
Travis: What?
Orion: Somebody asked me what my favorite Smash Brothers character is.
Travis: Oh.
Liam: Somebody asked how we pick the character class that we picked. When we first started this game, and I said, "hey, it's my birthday, I wanna play a game." Laura really likes rogues as well, but I made sure that as fast as I fucking could.
Travis: She was pissed.
Liam: So she, yeah. She plays rogue, in like Dragon Age and everything. That shit's a favorite class of hers, so I know I got it out there. Also, the reason that we're twins is because Laura and I have the exact same birthday, May 28th.
Ashley: I didn't know that.
Marisha: I didn't know that either.
Liam: That's why we're twins.
Marisha: That's cool.
Ashley: I knew-- I came in late to the game, and there were only a couple options left. And I had never played, so. I picked gnome because I was like, oh, that's funny. And then cleric, I didn't really realize what a cleric was. And how detailed it can be if you've never played. And important to the game. So when I started I was like, well shit, this is a little tougher than I thought it would be. But it's been awesome, I love being a cleric.
Liam: I'm so glad we pulled you in.
Ashley: Me too, man, me too. Oh, also, someone asked, who is Pike's deity. And it's Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, among other things.
Matt: Which is carried over actually from Pathfinder. Fifth Edition has its own suggested, there's never a definitive pantheon. But they have the deity pantheon. But we're carrying over Pathfinder deities that were prominently in the campaign up to this certain point, because why the hell not? We're not gonna make her change her deity, that would be weird.
Marisha: Travis, how did you pick your character?
Travis: What? Oh. I asked what the biggest playable character was, I think. One that liked to fight, drink, and fight.
Liam: One of the greatest pleasures for me, and I'm obviously a huge nerdlinger, and this is just me reliving high school. When I was talking to Sam about starting all this, and saying hey, let's get together, it's what I wanna do for my birthday, we pulled Travis in, Travis is fucking tight, look at him. He's not the stereotypical D&D player, and he was as snake bitten as the rest of us. Play Dungeons & Dragons, please play Dungeons & Dragons.
Travis: It was so good.
Ashley: It's the best.
Liam: It'll make you so happy.
Orion: What about you? Keyleth?
Marisha: I remember at the time I had a, we were playing another campaign, and I had like a rogue assassin, that you were in with me. And I had a kind of assassin character who was super seductress, and really high charisma. And I remember when I joined this game, I didn't really know any of you guys really all that well, and I was kind of new to this world, so I ended up going with a kind of druid, and I kind of deliberately made her introvert, in a weird way to kind of reflect my newcoming to the group, but I was like, "whoa, it'll be like I can be quiet." so Keyleth has a really low charisma, but I kind of spin it in that she's naive, and doesn't really know. And that's why she says things like, "but Clarence." (all laugh)
Marisha: "You're just special." Because she's naive, and kind of quiet. So she was just different than anything I've played before. But I really love being a druid. Druids are great.
Taliesin: I played a lot in school. Other than Matt, I probably had the most experience playing D&D, and playing roleplaying games.
Travis: Yeah you did. Genius.
Taliesin: So I was really excited by the gunslinger in Pathfinder just 'cause it was something I hadn't done before. So I found it the most interesting and unusual, but I was not, and I also felt it was a hole within the group that could be filled very well.
Liam: Thedouginator keeps asking you, Matt, how you brought the party together the first day of play.
Marisha: Wait, we haven't heard Tiberius' story as sorcerer. Then we can answer that question.
Orion: When this was going on, I asked Matt if there was a caster yet, like any glass cannons, and he said no. So I debated between a wizard and sorcerer. When we went over the different mechanics, how a wizard and a sorcerer works, I was more drawn to that. And I'm a huge RPG guy.
Liam: You're so entertaining.
Orion: To piggyback a quick question, to seal off the Tiberius thing, somebody asked if any of our voice acting influences our characters. Tiberius, absolutely. I played Elminster Aumar in the Neverwinter MMO. Which is a D&D MMO. And when we started this I'm essentially doing Elminster, but I made him super bubbly.
Taliesin: No, someone asked how the group, yeah.
Matt: We got together, first session, essentially, was in a swamp town named Stillben, and the group at the time had, for their own separate reasons, been in this town, needing money, and had kind of come together as a mercenary group out of necessity. So the first session was them having known each other from a circumstance where they all ended up helping out an individual in the city, long story short, they had a small rapport, and knew at least each other were useful, and needed cash. And there was a job board in the town. So the first session was them being hired to look into a conspiracy within this swamp port town, Stillben. That was their first real adventure together. And when that finished, they kept going from there.
Orion: Uh, troll penis story.
Ashley: Troll penis. (all laugh)
Marisha: That's fair.
Orion: I know you guys keep asking.
Liam: Take it away, Mercer.
Matt: There was a battle. Subterranean battle that involved the party sneaking upon a group of two trolls that were around a fire. The idea to work past this came to Tiberius to transform himself visually into a female troll so he could Bugs Bunny them. Hey boys, you know, that thing. Not knowing the temperament of trolls, especially ones that are deep underground, and don't get to see female trolls very often, they immediately just got extremely aggressive, and he found himself almost between a rock and a hard place.
Orion: I was getting raped by trolls.
Matt: The party then descended upon these trolls, and in the middle of battle, at numerous times, I believe Percy once and Laura the other, both took specific shots at each troll's dick. Rolled a good shot with enough damage to blow them off. Now being a troll, they regenerate. But it was still a good effect, and when the battle was over, it was decided by the party to at least take one as a trophy and place it in the bag of holding.
Travis: That was decided by me, thank you.
Matt: By Grog, and as such, it stayed for a while, until it was used as an implement of distraction in another encounter I believe.
Travis: It worked.
Matt: Yeah, it worked. That was where troll dick came from.
Orion: It was spitroasting.
Liam: Jake Bodro asked what's it like playing for three hours in front of 2,500 people? I think our games have gotten a little bit better, only because when we play privately, there were sometimes lulls, where we weren't sure what to do, we would go off to bathroom, we would take a break. But now there's a little bit of the element of theater to it. Just a sprinkle of it. And it kinda of gooses the energy up.
Orion: I'm doing the same thing for the record.
Travis: I keep seeing this one. For the 11 year old Sadie, the son of Odin shall have that cookie!
Matt: Aw, that's sweet.
Ashley: There you go.
Matt: There is one bag of holding in the group, and Grog always has it.
Travis: A troll dick and a bulette tongue.
Matt: There are many things that go into the bag.
Travis: It hasn't gone in that bag.
Taliesin: Is there still a cow in the bag?
Travis: No, Dork the ox.
Matt: Dork the ox is probably not.
Travis: That's when we first learned its limitations.
Matt: Why does Scanlan have so many awesome spells? Bards in Fifth Edition have one of the options they can choose. As they level up, can choose a couple of spells from any spellcasting class, which is great, and the boon that bards kinda needed to be more combat-effective. And you can choose the School of Lore or the School of Combat, I think, for the bard. He chose the School of Lore which allows you even more spells from other classes to boost your repertoire, so he became a fucking amazing bard.
Liam: Also, Sam Riegel did a lot of a capella in college.
Travis: He did, he really did.
Liam: He helped write several seasons of The Voice, which was all about a capella, so Samis sort of a ringer for the bard class.
Matt: Yeah, kinda had to happen that way.
Travis: Can Marisha do her dwarf impersonation?
Marisha: Nope.
Liam: Yordee yorda--
Marisha: Yorda youree yourdee yourd.
Ashley: Someone asked if Grog could keep one of his women in the bag of holding. You can't put living things in the bag of holding.
Taliesin: As we've learned.
Matt: You can.
Marisha: With Dork.
Matt: They just die.
Travis: There's no air, it's like a vacuum. A magical vacuum.
Matt: Dork the ox did not survive.
Travis: One giant dead ox came out of the bag.
Liam: Someone keeps asking if any of us have hirelings, or henchmen, and the simple answer to that is no.
Matt: That's not true.
Liam: Just Trinket.
Orion: At our Keep.
Taliesin: We do.
Liam: Oh, that's right!
Travis: Yeah, we battle-tested them.
Orion: We have a Keep back in--
Liam: Right before we started.
Travis: The game before we came here. After they saved the kingdom of Eman, the sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, as part of his gift to the group for essentially saving his family and the city itself, had a Keep constructed for them, and took about six months or so, and the Keep was finished, and then the party's first session was them finding who they're going to hire to take care of the Keep for them.
Liam: It was like one episode of the Sims.
Matt: Kind of. It was great too, 'cause Grog's whole idea of making them to see who would be the better hire was to break the pool cue and be like, "who survives?" Make them fight, it was pretty great.
Taliesin: For Tone17, I played a modified Malkavian, and a Smetty if you can believe such a thing, which was badass.
Matt: There you go.
Liam: We've been playing for two and a half years. Someone wanted to know how long.
Taliesin: Oh my God, really?
Travis: Did we tell them about your podcast with the recording of the very first one?
Liam: If you want, Sam and I, it's kind of languishing, but we have a podcast together called AllWorkNoPlay.
Travis: It's amazing.
Liam: We're both parents, we have kids, so we have no time to do anything. Enough time to take a shit. The first or second episode, the first episode is about us playing the first game, and there's audio from the first game. Again, go to iTunes, or to AllWorkNoPlay on Pod Bean, and you'll hear about two minutes of us dealing with a puzzle that Matt threw at us.
Marisha: It was timed.
Liam: Yeah, it was timed, there was an hourglass going off. It was us discovering D&D really for the first time. AllWorkNoPlay, all one word.
Marisha: Actually one of my favorite stories that I tell all the time is about you, from our first game, 'cause if you remember, I didn't play. I just kinda helped Matt help you guys. I was like a D&D minion. And I remember I was helping you, and I remember you were like, "So, if I just wanted to go up and punch those guards, I could do that?" And I was like, yeah, well you would go up, and you would punch them, and then Matt would tell you how you'd do that. And then you went like this, you were like.
Travis: Computing.
Marisha: Yeah, you were like, "so, we can do anything?" (all laugh)
Marisha: And I was like, yeah.
Liam: Taliesin on game one was actually not Percy, he was a dragonborn paladin?
Taliesin: I was a dragonborn paladin.
Liam: You fucking blew our minds, we were like, "what do I do? Can I do damage points to stop this puzzle." There was this tunnel with all these moving parts, we thought we were gonna be crushed, and he was a dragonborn for the first episode. It's in the recording on the the AllWorkNoPlay podcast. And he just breathed ice on this water-based--
Taliesin: Contraption.
Liam: And froze it, and everyone was like, "you can do that? You can't just roll dice and hit it?" And that's when we kind of understood oh, it's whatever the fuck you want.
Taliesin: That was such a good game for learning the basic mechanics. Such a well put together game.
Orion: Matt does control the music while we play.
Matt: Yes, I have playlists. They were much more broad playlists before, unfortunately on the stream, we have to use only approved royalty-free music, so it took me a while to figure it out previous to this.
Travis: I do miss those Madonna songs.
Matt: I know. I used to play a lot of Bush.
Marisha: Hey, would that count as fan art? If fans made us music?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Could we then use that? Yeah? He's nodding.
Zac: They can send us whatever they want.
Marisha: Some consent forms? Yeah.
Travis: If one of your characters died, would you roll a new character?
Orion: Music people out there.
Marisha: Any music people. Anything atmospheric.
Liam: No, no, that's an important question.
Travis: Ignore it.
Liam: No, it's important. Someone's asking, if we die, would we roll in a new character? And plus, we just started this show, so part of us were wondering like, what if we die the second episode? What happens? We recorded this opening to the show that's coming.
Matt: So here's how I run the world. I feel that one of the problems in some RPGs is that death becomes flippant when magic allows you to completely undo it. In my campaigns certain powerful spells like Greater Restoration, Resurrection, things like that are a challenge, meaning you can definitely undo death, but a lot of it is based on your capabilities as a spellcaster, your attachment to the people you've been traveling with. So if ever a character does die, a resurrection can be attempted, but it is a challenge. Which means there's a possibility of it failing. In which case, if the resurrection fails, the soul is lost, the character is permanently dead. The player then can leave and never come back if they want to, but they have the option to create a new character, and be reintroduced to the campaign like half a level lower than the rest.
Ashley: That would suck so much.
Liam: When Pike died we had, all of us, many series of dice rolls to do, and it was very story-based.
Marisha: Yeah people are asking how she came back.
Liam: Yeah, I mean, luckily we were in a big city, there was a huge temple. There were very wise clerics who were good at bringing people back. But still, we all had to roll. There was three rounds we had to roll, he might have fudged numbers, I don't know. But we were all still scared. We had to all, the majority of us, had to have good rolls three times in a row. Scanlan had to put--
Travis: The tears of three women in the room.
Liam: The tears, Scanlan had to kiss her on the head, he put a figure that he carved of her, it was very elaborate. This one was majorly in tears. Laura was in tears.
Ashley: I was in tears.
Taliesin: Laura was hyperventilating.
Orion: And when that was going on, I remember, when that went off, being still Tiberius, I was like in half character but half not, and I was not crying, I was like, (grumbles) the whole time, and as soon as she sprung back to life, because the cleric--
Matt: Breathed in her first breath after that.
Orion: We luckily, because I know it was a tight roll.
Matt: It was a very tight roll. It was a DC of 14 in the final roll, and because Scanlan brought out this figure of her that he had carved for her like two months beforehand as a gift, sets it down and kisses her on the forehead, and it was kinda the final connection point. He needed 14, he rolled a 12, but, because he-- There's a plus two modifier to the skill check, being a bard, and that was what he needed, he just made it. Basic, basic--
Liam: Someone's asking if we drink while playing, and the answer is no. (all laugh)
Travis: It's just water in those tankards.
Taliesin: Coffee.
Marisha: I almost did, yeah.
Orion: When she came back to life is when Tiberius, I was like, "oh my God, she's okay!"
Ashley: I think also having-- Because with magic and everything like that, just bringing somebody back to life so easily, since we don't have that as much as maybe other games-- It's heightened, so every time someone gets hurt, we're all, I think now, after having that death, all of us are like, "where are you at? Where are you at?"
Orion: Where are you going? I wish I could turn to Sam, but he's not here.
Ashley: We're all so stressed out now, which is, it's kinda cool.
Matt: Mortality's a real thing you have to deal with, and up until Pike's death it was kind of a thing people weren't considering. It just happened so suddenly.
Liam: One I see keep coming up since we started is how would we react to life if we were our characters? I don't know, or differently from our characters? 'Cause I wouldn't stab my children when they frustrate me.
Matt: I'd be in a padded room. (all laugh)
Marisha: I feel like everyone tries to make decisions in a game that their character would make in real life, 'cause that's kind of the point. I take into consideration that I have shitty charisma, whenever I open my mouth. I feel like we all try and take into consideration our background and our alignment, because that's, you know.
Taliesin: I feel significantly more badass than my character.
Orion: I feel... Tiberius is just me with magic. So that's how I feel.
Travis: Grog was easy, he makes bad decisions, which is just all that I do.
Matt: Pike died when they were fighting what was called a treachery demon, or a glabrezu, which had basically infiltrated the Sovereign Uriel, and the city of Emon. And when it revealed its final form, it got one lucky critical hit on Pike when she was too close, and just instantly took her out. That's how she died. Someone's asking if they can (laughs) send us equipment we need for the show. Zac.
Zac: Yeah, they can.
Matt: What do you need?
Zac: We'll put it on the wishlist.
Matt: There you go, it's on the wishlist.
Orion: There's a wishlist?
Matt: I didn't know there was one, but now there is.
Zac: Castle Greyskull on there.
Liam: How do we feel about Team Demihooman, and inspiring them to play D&D for the first time? I think the number one reason we all wanna do this is because we love each other, and we love this game. The second thing is we all knew, we kind of felt like-- We're gonna make Dungeons & Dragons cool again.
Matt: Try at least.
Liam: And make it open for anyone to do, there's no reason not to do this. If there's someone you know who doesn't understand it, don't worry about it. Just find some friends and connect with them.
Matt: I find one of the difficult things is explaining to somebody who has never played an RPG, or a game of D&D at all, they're like, "how does it work, what is it?" And it's hard to explain, so if anything, now we have an example with this show. Other than the IT Crowd episode, or the Community episode, which are both great examples for quick little succinct things.
Taliesin: If we had the power to bring one guest player for one session.
Orion: Oh, that's easy. Tom Hanks, for sure. (all laugh)
Marisha: Mazes and Madness.
Zac: Everyone is asking for you guys to somehow get Vin Diesel.
Marisha: I was gonna say, Vin Diesel.
Orion: He lives for this shit!
Matt: Vin Diesel's good. Top of my list is Stephen Colbert, because I know he also plays.
Ashley: That would be amazing.
Taliesin: I would love to see Joss Whedon do this. I admit I would like to see Joss Whedon play D&D. That'd be interesting.
Zac: That might be possible.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm throwing that one out there.
Orion: What, Tom Hanks isn't?
Marisha: Felicia's got some.
Matt: But he's also a super fuckin' busy man.
Orion: Guys, tweet at Tom Hanks to come play with us.
Travis: I'm Morgan Freeman, and I rolled a one.
Matt: Right now, Critical Role Hanks. See if we can make it trend. Patton Oswalt would be great.
Orion: That'd be hilarious.
Zac: What about Dan Harmon, just so I can get fired, can we do that? (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah. Hardwick used to play D&D with Patton Oswalt in the mid-2000s. I can't even imagine what those games were like.
Orion: I'd like to like-- Amy Poehler, I'd like to have one of those.
Zac: She might be open to that. She's a partner with Legendary.
Orion: I'd love her, Tina, Tina Fey.
Liam: Someone keeps asking about Troy, I don't know if Troy Baker is ready.
Orion: I don't think he's ready for this jelly. You guys think he's ready for this jelly? I don't think so.
Matt: Whenever it comes up in conversation, Troy always gives me that look of like... "All right."
Travis: You can see him swimming in the infinity of--
Marisha: "That's not cool."
Liam: He has some preconceived notions.
Marisha: "My scarves are cooler than you."
Matt: Once we get him like a proper plus two enchanted scarf.
Ashley: Can we ship Grog and Vex?
Travis: Grog and Vex. No, I'm here to annoy Vex by smacking her bear around, and she's here to tell me not to kill myself. "Don't jump into the crevasse, it's 1000 feet deep."
Ashley: Troy Baker is Pike's distanced dad. (all laugh)
Matt: That's pretty funny.
Liam: Answer this question I like, I saw it a couple times, how did you guys get involved in streaming for Geek & Sundry?
Travis: Virgin sacrifice.
Matt: The best way I know that happened was, we had been playing for a while, and we all work in the industry. People began to hear about our voiceover D&D game, weirdly. Like I'd come into sessions with directors I've never worked with before, they'd be like, "Oh yeah, you're the guy that runs that D&D game." How did that happen? How is that my thing? I'm cool with it, like heck yeah, my little high school self is like, I'm okay with being known about that. But then over time eventually Geek & Sundry contacted us. Felicia had heard about it. They called me in for a meeting, and we spent a number of months trying to figure out what format we were gonna try, if we wanna do it like multi camera, filmed canned episodes, then eventually the Twitch possibility came up, and we were like no, this is a much better format for us. And that's kind of how it happened.
Liam: Are you kosher with me, you took this film, there's a video of you breaking the news to us that Geek & Sundry came to you about it. Are you kosher with me sharing that video?
Matt: Yeah, I don't see why not.
Liam: All right, I'll find a way to put it through my Twitter. So just keep your eye on my Twitter.
Ashley: Wait, what are you sharing?
Liam: There was a video that Orion took when Matt told us about Geek & Sundry coming to him. And us all sort of toasting and laughing.
Orion: Reacting.
Liam: Giggling like idiots.
Matt: Why is D&D Pathfinder making you so much more attached to the characters than a regular RPG? If you mean like a video game RPG? I mean you get attached either way, but with this, because you are so much more fluid, with how you can influence the world, and the character, and the way the character reacts to the world and how it can influence it is so much more--
Marisha: Personal.
Matt: Personal, a good way of putting it. It's just that much more involving, and you invest so much into that atmosphere. And it depends on the group, some people just like to do dungeon crawls, and kill and get loot and experience, and that's totally cool too. For me at least. I like 'em both for different reasons. I still play the crap out of video game RPGs.
Liam: Someone asked if given the chance, would we like to do a live game at a convention like Acquisition Inc.? I'd like to do, although there's nine of us, so that'd be kind of--
Ashley: That'd be a long game.
Zac: We may be asking you guys to do that soon.
Liam: Oh good, then yes.
Matt: As long as you're handling the tech, I think we'd be fine with that.
Liam: I'd like to do it.
Zac: We may be streaming from Comic Con, I don't know. We may be asking if you guys are gonna go through that hell hole.
Liam: The answer is yes.
Orion: Can we get a jib? I like crane shots.
Marisha: Ooh.
Ashley: A helicopter? A helicopter shot.
Orion: Put it on the wishlist.
Zac: Put it on the wishlist, a jib.
Liam: How many of you aside from Matt have run a game of D&D or another RPG? In high school I ran a D&D game, I ran a Rifts game for a little while.
Matt: Rifts, yes.
Liam: I ran a cyberpunk game for a little while.
Travis: Really?
Liam: Yes. The last two months I have been helping my eight-year-old son and two of his friends from school create characters. And I wouldn't have done this if Matt had not forced this shit into my life. I wouldn't have done this, but I'm about to start running a game for my son, the half-elf druid, and his two friends, the dragonborn fighter, and the dragonborn rogue.
Travis: What if they die?
Liam: That's just how the cookie crumbles, motherfucker.
Travis: Oh man, you are teaching life lessons.
Marisha: Gotta teach lessons.
Travis: Go Fish and then D&D.
Taliesin: I ran a Rifts game as well in high school. Then I ran a game of Vampire the Masquerade, and I was in a bunch of them.
Liam: Of course you did.
Taliesin: Couple rounds of Paranoia, and Hole, because that's funny. Hole was amazing.
Matt: Which you gave me books for. For my birthday, which was awesome.
Marisha: I was a part of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer tabletop RPG for a while. Yeah, it's actually quite fun. I was a pyromancer.
Orion: Somebody asked a fun one, they asked if we play, what's our favorite video game?
Marisha: What's our favorite video games? Oh that's a hard question.
Orion: Is it?
Marisha: There's so many!
Orion: Well we can skip it.
Liam: Metal Gear, Dragon Age.
Ashley: Probably Portal, Portal or Dragon Age.
Matt: Portal's great.
Liam: Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, I played 'til I had blisters on my thumbs.
Matt: Symphony of the Night, yeah, dude. What is a man?
Taliesin: Borderlands 2, and I'm happy--
Ashley: Borderlands 2.
Liam: Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64.
Orion: Oh shit.
Liam: Baldur's Gate, which I played again on my iPad a year or two ago. Somebody, oh go ahead.
Orion: I was just saying.
Liam: Somebody asked how we focus in the room with the sexual magnetism that is Scanlan Shorthalt.
Ashley: Ooh, it's tough man.
Liam: I don't know.
Taliesin: I wear a codpiece. I wear a codpiece that keeps everything in check.
Matt: I'm heavily sedated most of the game, just for that reason. Otherwise the clothes would just come right off.
Liam: I just let myself get a gigantic boner every week.
Matt: Does anyone play League? Generally.
Marisha: Sometimes. We're playing Heroes of the Storm more now.
Orion: I'm a big Final Fantasy fan. I like all kinds of games. I definitely would say if I had to pick one RPG, cause I'm an RPG guy, I love Chrono Cross, that'd be my favorite game. I've played that more than I have Chrono Trigger, which is way too many times.
Travis: Dragon Age race/class. Ash, anybody that plays?
Matt: Elf rogue.
Taliesin: Human fighter.
Travis: Always the mage.
Liam: Travis, stupid question, Thor, Odinson, or Hulk, in a knock down drag out?
Travis: Oh (scoffs).
Orion: Type-0 also, dammit.
Travis: Contractually, Thor, realistically, Hulk. I mean I am Thor, I can't say any other guy.
Taliesin: Hulk's on a scaling power level, 'cause he just gets too mad.
Travis: Yeah let's just be real about that. That's Hulk.
Matt: Tried new Final Fantasy yet?
Ashley: ChocolateSweets a bunch of times has asked would you guys consider cosplay for the games?
Taliesin: Well technically. We already did.
Marisha: You'll see, maybe next week?
Matt: He's trying the best he can. We have an intro coming up some point soon.
Zac: Halfway done.
Matt: Halfway done, we all shot loosely in character costumes inspired by everyone's characters, so you'll be able to see that soon.
Taliesin: If anyone would like to make us costumes.
Liam: One man doing it all.
Travis: A million arms.
Ashley: I think it would be kinda hard for me to play the game in cosplay, 'cause I have probably the most armor now.
Matt: You do. You wear the most armor.
Orion: That's a cool question. If you had to switch characters Matt, if you had to switch characters, which one would you be?
Marisha: If you had to trade places with one of us?
Orion: Yeah, if you would switch characters.
Zac: That question was Matt included, question was for everyone, if you guys could switch characters with anyone, who would you pick? Including Matt.
Ashley: I would probably switch with Liam or Travis.
Taliesin: Tiberius would be mine, I'd take Tiberius.
Liam: Scanlan, I would be Scanlan.
Matt: I would be Scanlan, bards man. Bards are my favorite class.
Marisha: I'd be probably either Scanlan or Pike.
Travis: I'd be Trinket.
Matt: Yeah you would.
Travis: Why are you peeing on everything?
Marisha: Bards and clerics are great.
Orion: I'd definitely be Grog. Just the complete opposite of what I can do.
Taliesin: I'm a WoW player on occasion, I haven't played in ages.
Orion: For the Horde.
Matt: Player wants to play a lizardfolk monk, what's my opinion about the idea? That's fine, I mean a player can play whatever they want to, as long as you as the DM want it in your campaign. Just make sure they have more to their character besides "I'm a lizard monk!" have a good reason why they trained as a monk. If they make a cool personality behind it, work it into the social structure of their lizardfolk people, and see whether the monks will be shunned or accepted, are they an outcast of the society? Think of those ideas, and make a cool character based on the story, from a fighting standpoint? That'd be cool. I used to play a lizard monk in Ruins of Kunark back in the old EQ days. Oh man. That was a while back.
Liam: Someone asked when Trinket came into the mix. Day one.
Travis: Day one. She had that shit like that. She knew she wanted a pet bear.
Marisha: He hasn't died yet.
Orion: He hasn't died, it's amazing, this thing has not died. He should have died so many times.
Matt: She spent all of her character focus in having a pet from combat, and then never puts it in combat, because she doesn't want it to get killed, and it's fucking hilarious.
Travis: We put it jeopardy situations before.
Matt: Yeah, you have. Every time she goes, "never again!" And I'm like, all right, well.
Taliesin: The day that bear dies, it's gonna get ugly.
Ashley: It's gonna be bad.
Orion: It's good to change her, as a character.
Travis: Alignment shift.
Taliesin: So much black to wear.
Marisha: Douginator asked me a super detailed question. So I don't wanna blow over it, 'cause it was awesome. He asked me how my path has gone, and my personal Aramente journey, and how working with the group has helped and slowed it down. For the Air Ashari and for Keyleth's journey, it's kind of expected to take her maybe ten, maybe 20 years? It takes her like, the Aramente is expected to take a long time, and part of it is her kind of proving herself a hero. So she kind of ended up tagging along with this motley crew in order to kind of help her so she's not doing it alone. So it's a good thing that she's tagging along. But she also has to deal with sometimes the moral dilemma of maybe choices that she might not normally make if she wasn't with the group that she has to go with.
Liam: I see two questions I wanna address. One is what is each of our favorite kill?
Orion: I was gonna say that was a good one.
Liam: And the second one is what's the story behind the Super High Intensity Team? (all laugh)
Liam: Let's start with the kills, and then we'll get to the SHITs. My favorite kill, I finished off a blue dragon we faced. We all chipped away at this dragon, someone who had disguised himself as human for a long time, then we came to their secret cubbyhole, and they revealed themselves. We chipped away and chipped away, then at the end I sort of parkour-ran up a wall and shoved the daggers into its neck, and just slid down its entire body and finished it.
Orion: My favorite kill is actually--
Liam: Until today.
Orion: When Pike kicked the bucket, and that moment all of us realized what happened, and there was an instant shift in real emotion, where whatever the hell, I don't even remember who we were fighting, because I went like, fucking cast this, and everyone's just, kill this thing, because we all cared so much in a real life situation, where we hated this thing, with real emotion, and we just slaughtered it.
Taliesin: The demon-possessed royal family was my favorite.
Liam: That was the same thing.
Taliesin: Yeah, that was my favorite fight. Just using the light, also we were shooting, I was getting to shoot holes in the glass.
Matt: The entire throne room had a glass dome overtop, but because the family had been possessed by the shades, these shadow entities, it was all covered. They were able to force these spirits out of the physical bodies without killing them by being able to tear off the cloth or shoot holes in it to allow sunlight in and use that as part of the battle tactic, it worked out really cool.
Marisha: Yeah, that was fun.
Travis: My favorite kill wasn't even an enemy, it was when Scanlan summoned that pony, when we were facing those five wizards. (all laugh)
Travis: He summoned this pony, and then I turned and abruptly cut its fucking head off, and reached in and grabbed its organs, and smeared its gore all over myself, and started screaming. And Mercer was like, "okay."
Orion: The fight ended there.
Matt: Roll intimidation, with a bonus.
Travis: Butchered a pony for intimidation.
Matt: Yeah, it worked.
Marisha: I think one of my favorite Keyleth moments, it wasn't a kill, but when we were in the crazy, Michael Jackson, Neverland Ranch, sorcerer dude's plane of existence.
Matt: The Dread Emperor.
Marisha: Yeah, when we were in his plane of existence, and we encountered that big tree rock monster, and I just happened to take Command Plants, and he happened to be a plant monster, so it just worked out perfectly, and I was just like, "we don't wanna fight you! back down." and avoided an entire battle.
Taliesin: Getting the magic carpet was also pretty badass.
Marisha: Oh yeah, that was a good story.
Liam: Another fabulous moment that you guys have to know about is we wanted to get into a tower at one point, and there was a very intelligent sort of right-hand man to whoever owned the tower. Scanlan just started fast-talking, which is his defining characteristic. Took his finger and put it right here as a mustache, and said, "hi, I'm Burt Reynolds." (all laugh)
Liam: And he rolled, either Scanlan rolled a 20--
Travis: I think it was a natural.
Matt: He rolled a natural 20.
Liam: And you weren't expecting it to work, in any way, shape, or form, and you went, "okay."
Travis: Mr. Reynolds.
Marisha: Burt Reynolds just announced that he's gonna be at Philly Wizard World with us, so we could theoretically tell him that story.
Matt: I have to.
Ashley: Burt Reynolds would be a dream guest.
Orion: Him and Tom Hanks.
Travis: He'd have to play on a bearskin carpet.
Matt: The whole family history organized.
Ashley: I've only had one kill.
Travis: But, it was what?
Ashley: And it was a dragon.
Travis: Yeah, dragonslayer.
Ashley: But the thing that I, probably the whole battle with the family that was sort of possessed when I actually died, that was probably one of my favorite battles. Maybe not after I died, prior to. When I got to finish off the dragon--
Taliesin: Was that on Christmas?
Ashley: The dragon? Yes. That night was so amazing because we had, we made it a winter festival. So we all came in our pajamas. It was close to Christmas, that's why it was a winter festival. It was like our little Christmas party.
Marisha: Our holiday episode.
Liam: That was sad for me because it was my idea but I had health problems at the time and I had to bow out, and I was very, very, very sad.
Matt: But you made it to this year's. I made it the following year, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, we had a whole little thing, it was really nice.
Matt: I would love to play D&D with Dame Judy Dench.
Marisha: Heck yeah.
Matt: You guys can tweet at her so you can get her to agree.
Liam: The SHITs. How did we become the SHITs?
Matt: Yes. So the party had run into a, debearded, actually, shaven dwarf named Grimthorn, who wanted to represent them for, what is occasionally, a roving brawling guild, essentially. Like underground fighting rings that happen around the world at different points throughout the year. It may come up again, we'll see. But they had to think of a team name. And Scanlan. Recommended the Super High Intensity Team. Which stuck for a while, so the group name, against the better judgement of, I think, a lot of the group, became The SHITs. So their name for a while was The SHITs, they were announced as The SHITs in the ring, when they won the tournament. That was when the pony was cut in half, to intimidate the opposing team.
Travis: Scanlan's idea also.
Orion: Tiberius and Keyleth were not happy.
Matt: SHITs stuck for a while until eventually they got rid of the SHITs, as all of a sudden they were about to go to the winter festival parade in their honor for saving the entire city of Eman, and the Sovereign Uriel said, "what should we announce you as?" and it was decided not to announce you guys in front of the city at your parade as The SHITs.
Ashley: I was super into it. Still love The SHITs.
Matt: Instead the name became Vox Machina. So if you've heard them say that, that's the official team name they've created for themselves as a group.
Orion: With credit to Sam as well, which was voted down was also the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood. Which I was a huge fan of. I really wanted it to be the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood. But Vox Machina sounded cooler.
Ashley: The Brotherhood of the Sisterhood of the Order, or something like that?
Marisha: The Order of the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.
Orion: So Tiberius recognizes as the Vox Machina/Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.
Liam: LargoSensei keeps asking, what are your most cathartic voice acting experiences? I'm gonna guess for Ashley that's The Last of Us, since that's your fucking heart ripped out of your chest.
Ashley: Probably, yeah.
Liam: Gollum was pretty sad for me, because he's a miserable bastard. Also Angel from Wolverine, the X-Men.
Orion: Wait, does cathartic mean sad?
Liam: Well it just means get your fucking demons out. Chew it up.
Taliesin: Mine's really old, it's probably either Monster or Paranoia Agent. I'm gonna go that far back. Yeah, all the way back.
Matt: Fate Zero for me had a moment that was pretty intense emotionally, that I really enjoyed.
Travis: Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic. (all laugh)
Matt: Sonic Boom, yo.
Marisha: Boom, Sonic Boom.
Travis: What's that?
Liam: Infamous, maybe?
Travis: Oh, yeah.
Liam: Pretty fucking sad.
Travis: Brothers. Brotherhood. Brotherly love.
Orion: I'd say for me it was doing Type-0. Not so much the actual lines, 'cause I had a lot of fun. I don't know if that's cathartic, but. Completing an actual real life dream goal. I've said this a couple times before, but the last day I was recording the last stuff, I was literally crying on the way home, because I finally got to level myself up. And this thing kept it up, and it was really cool.
Travis: Matt, who were you in Fate-0?
Matt: I'm Kiritsugu, Kiritsugu Emiya.
Travis: Bless you.
Matt: Thank you. That's the dark assassin character.
Taliesin: Saw a question about Percy's home, and his family. Percy has a really really big family, that I don't mention in the video, and he has not been home yet. He has no interest in going home yet, 'cause that's terrifying. So we have not dealt with that.
Matt: That's going to be interesting when that comes around.
Travis: What's under the freakin' lake?
Liam: What's under the freakin' lake, Matt?
Marisha: Yeah, what's under the lake?
Matt: You were told.
Orion: Yeah, it's one of those big--
Matt: Aboleth.
Marisha: Oh yeah that's right, I did write it down.
Matt: Which you encountered one underground.
Marisha: Yes, I was a shark.
Matt: Put the slime into the water. You could only breathe water and couldn't breathe air.
Marisha: Remember, 'cause I was like, "I'm gonna be crafty and turn into a shark," and then I started immediately drowning.
Orion: How do you keep players from getting OP, Matt?
Matt: Make the monsters more powerful.
Orion: Behind the scenes, I'm always constantly up his ass, trying to make Tiberius as OP as possible, and he's always stopping me a lot.
Matt: Balance is important. I mean, the characters, everyone here has really good characters that have a lot of cool abilities, but they also have a lot of challenges that come at them that make them, not only use those abilities, but also, monsters can have cool abilities too.
Liam: Bracheon89, you said Stephen King plays D&D?
Ashley: Yes, that's what I was trying to say. What?
Liam: Bracheon, we're going to wait for your answer. How do you know he plays D&D?
Ashley: Are you sure?
Liam: Let's get him in here.
Matt: I'd love that.
Taliesin: The group's worst decision in D&D was the dragon, I think.
Marisha: Oh yeah, Grog?
Taliesin: Grog.
Travis: Listen, there was a shitload of gold.
Ashley: I still don't think that was a bad idea.
Orion: Oh, when he started hoarding all the gold?
Marisha: We still don't know if that--
Liam: Takes a lot of stupid.
Marisha: He might have been an ally. We might have killed someone who was valuable.
Taliesin: You were still freaking out like a month later, you were feeling really bad.
Travis: Well, I did almost get us killed.
Ashley: I feel like it was a good decision.
Matt: To be fair, it's the only time I've ever had a player rage loot before. (all laugh)
Matt: You went into a rage, and used it to just loot more. And then the dragon revealed itself, and you looked at it, and you just kept looting. (all laugh)
Travis: You guys take care of this.
Ashley: That was hilarious.
Matt: That's Grog.
Liam: Somebody keeps asking, and we'll do a show of hands here, Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones?
Ashley: Oh, come on.
Marisha: Ooh, that's tough.
Liam: What do you prefer? 10 seconds to think about it, and then I'll--
Taliesin: That's like Star Trek or Star Wars.
Marisha: Yeah, hard.
Liam: They're asking the question.
Zac: Don't be afraid, come on.
Travis: That's tough.
Liam: Lord of the Rings, fuckin' Lord of the Rings. There you go, there's the answer.
Ashley: I don't know, man.
Taliesin: Lord of the Rings, but I see Game of Thrones on the side.
Liam: I love Game of Thrones.
Marisha: Of course we do.
Travis: Lord of the Rings.
Taliesin: We wouldn't have Game of Thrones without Lord of the Rings.
Marisha: That's the thing.
Liam: Maybe possibly not Dungeons & Dragons without Lord of the Rings.
Ashley: This is true, it's the OG. I don't know what that even--
Taliesin: You said that. That just came out of your mouth.
Ashley: Please let's leave it alone. Moving on.
Travis: That's the OG.
Ashley: What is this, what do we have over here? Well, who was the old gnome that Grog saved in his intro video?
Liam: Pike's daddy.
Ashley: No, that was my great great grandfather.
Travis: That's right.
Ashley: Yes, great great grandfather Wilhand.
Travis: Wilhelm, hand? Wilhand.
Ashley: That's right.
Liam: Wilhand the money.
Travis: Grog has an intelligence of six, he's gonna get names wrong from time to time.
Liam: Everybody, if you could choose whatever fantasy world to live in, what would it be?
Travis: Marvel.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Orion: I would live in the... Next Generation world, universe.
Taliesin: You had me at Marvel.
Travis: Yeah.
Zac: Here's the thing, you could live in Marvel what you live in, if you couldn't live in that world as a superhero, just as a normal person.
Travis: Right, not in New York. Anybody that lives in New York in the Marvel universe is just stupid. Like rent's gotta be $1.50.
Taliesin: Terrible idea.
Matt: I'd say Myst. So I can just write my own worlds to infinity from there.
Liam: Lord of the Rings.
Matt: Or Amber as well.
Ashley: I was gonna say Lord of the Rings. Maybe Rivendell.
Marisha: I'm gonna say Final Fantasy 10.
Matt: Grey Havens. If you're gonna do Lord of the Rings, do Grey Havens, 'cause you're far enough away from Mordor, where it's generally not gonna be a problem.
Liam: I wanna be one of the Fellowship. Ashley Johnson lived in a Marvel universe already, right?
Matt: That's true.
Orion: See, and it's a big hassle.
Marisha: It was a big hassle.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Before the stream, our D&D session--
Marisha: High insurance rates.
Matt: Before the stream our D&D sessions would happen once every month to month and a half, more like month and a half.
Liam: Why is Matt Scarlet Witch?
Matt: I'm down with it. 'Cause I alter reality. Power makes sense. Our sessions used to be once every month, or month and a half, and they would be about six to eight hours. But the problem is we'd play so infrequently, every session I'd have to remind everyone what happened, and it was hard to schedule. Part of the reason we're even doing this show, is because it's technically work, which allows those of us who have families and children more of an excuse to come more often. So yeah.
Liam: Googoo17, Arkazey keeps asking, what's your favorite nerdy t-shirt you own? Mine is one that says Mordor World Tour, it looks like a rock 'n' roll t-shirt, but it says Mordor World Tour.
Marisha: That's cool. Favorite nerdy t-shirt.
Taliesin: I've got a Sons of Anarchy Doctor Who t-shirt, I'm a really big fan of. I'll wear it next week.
Marisha: I've got like an army, kind of soldiery, looking t-shirt that says Chimera, like Chimera Corps.
Matt: That's actually the one I was gonna say, that's my favorite shirt too.
Marisha: I like your displacer kitty you've got.
Matt: Displacer kitty's kind of cool. Adorable.
Taliesin: I like your shine on me shirt.
Matt: Oh God. If you guys haven't watched. Chris Dane Owens, on YouTube, Chris Dane Owens, Shine on Me. It's a music video, watch it. Chris Dane Owens, Shine, or Shine on Me, YouTube, do it.
Taliesin: I love that you own the shirt from it.
Matt: I bought a shirt from it, 'cause it's that amazing, I had to.
Travis: Did anyone tell Pike that Scanlan killed the naga for her?
Matt: I don't think someone's done it yet.
Liam: Scanlan had his first kill. You saw it, right?
Matt: You saw it on the stream.
Ashley: I saw it, me, Ashley saw it, but Pike did not hear about it yet. Who knows, that could be the thing that seals the deal. I'll be like, you killed the naga? Okay, let's do this. (all laugh)
Marisha: Any betrayals in the game?
Matt: No betrayals, disagreements, and occasional--
Travis: Trippings and beat-downs.
Matt: And stealing of flying carpets.
Ashley: I actually did step, I kind of did hurt Liam one game. Or Vax.
Liam: The game we played together? We did just the two of us one night.
Ashley: There were some of the girls changing in a room.
Matt: I forgot about this.
Liam: I was very curious to see you naked. But that's kinda fallen on the wayside.
Ashley: Vax was very curious to see what a gnome looked like naked.
Liam: Never seen it before.
Marisha: So you did a little peeping tom?
Liam: Why wouldn't I wanna expand my horizons?
Matt: So he rolled stealth.
Ashley: So he rolled stealth, and he did, and saw or whatever, and then when I came back out, and I found out about it.
Liam: Looked good, it was compact.
Ashley: It was just a small human. And I think I stepped on your foot, and gave you some damage.
Liam: Maybe a hit point.
Ashley: Yeah, a hit point or two.
Matt: You earned it.
Ashley: I earned it.
Orion: Somebody, seagullblaster--
Liam: No, Vax didn't spy on Vex, sorry, go ahead.
Orion: Asked-- Tiberius said something about the Palestone, and what it is, and this is, somebody asked a different question, this is kinda gonna answer both. I, and everybody else, wrote backstories for Matthew to essentially give him so he could construct our universe. Tiberius' particular quest is looking for particular artifacts. Essentially I made him like Mulder. Nobody believes in the city that these things exist, except him, so the truth is out there kinda thing. So I made up these five different artifacts that do different things. And I don't know what they do until I might maybe find them, and if I do, it's up to him, to Matt, to determine what they are, if they are anything. They might be nothing, I don't know. I've found one item so far, and it's awesome, and all of us have given him bits and pieces, and that's how he constructs our story with things that you throw in yourself.
Matt: Yeah, and each player, all their story lines work into the world. Not all of them will happen immediately of course, some people have had personal encounters and story encounters already, some are yet to occur, and there will be points throughout the campaign where the party will probably have to move and individually deal with each person's story to some extent.
Marisha: Dealt a little bit with each person.
Matt: Touched a little bit like-- In Eman, we've seen Vex and Vax's father.
Liam: Vex and I ran into to our father again for the first time in many years, it was a little frosty.
Matt: Had a new family.
Liam: Have a little half sister.
Travis: Matt, you have a favorite voice? And does it hurt to do the gnarly monster voice?
Matt: If you do it for an extended period of time it can be kind of shitty.
Ashley: I don't know how you do this new one.
Travis: Breathing in and out.
Liam: That's inward singing, man.
Travis: It is inward singing.
Liam: And then I'm fucking singing, and then--
Matt: Actually, it's funny, a bunch of my NPCs that I've done since high school have ended up turning into characters I've booked. I'll go into an audition and be like, "I'll go ahead and do Nutibe Curios, from my Second campaign," and I'll end up doing that character. Alof in Pillars is a character I NPCed back in high school.
Liam: That's awesome.
Taliesin: They still haven't heard my favorite voice from this campaign yet. 'Cause we haven't gone back to the city yet.
Matt: Oh, Gilmore?
Liam: Gilmore is a wonderful magician who owns a shop.
Orion: Was that the fancy--
Liam: Yes, in the city of Eman, he's got a big friggin' crush on me, and wants me. Wants me and some day you and I will actualize that.
Matt: We'll have to roleplay that.
Liam: Maybe in a game. Maybe not.
Travis: What do we think is taking over the hive mind?
Matt: What do you guys think is taking over the hive mind?
Marisha: Well we know it's named--
Orion: Obviously some butthole.
Ashley: I think I might have an idea.
Travis: Yeah, you had a vision that we don't even know about yet, right?
Ashley: Well.
Travis: Taking those mushrooms, having those visions.
Ashley: Taking those mushrooms.
Liam: Someone asked how do game devs find us for acting work? We all audition, hundreds of people audition, for every role in Los Angeles, we all just try. Today I worked on a superhero game, and the guy who was directing me for voiceover said, "hey, so what are you doing for the rest of the day?" And I said, well, I'm gonna go to the gym, I'm gonna do this, then I'm gonna go do that, do you know about that D&D show that a couple of us are doing? And he's like, "yeah, I heard about that." And the guy who had written the game went, "yeah, I've watched every episode." (all laugh)
Matt: So awesome.
Taliesin: That's so cool.
Ashley: Someone wants to hear Gilmore's voice.
Taliesin: I think we should save that for, wait until they actually meet Gilmore.
Travis: Yeah, we can't give it away.
Matt: Gilmore's a fun one.
Ashley: Gilmore's awesome.
Matt: Gilmore is very Broadway. He's very--
Taliesin: Not the gargoyle.
Matt: No, no. I could see him being a character in a John Waters film.
Taliesin: Oh my God, yeah.
Ashley: Totally.
Liam: Give him a pencil-thin mustache.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm trying to catch up.
Travis: Greater overall motivations?
Matt: That may or may not be secret, depending on the characters.
Marisha: What is each person's favorite D&D monster?
Travis: A dead one.
Liam: I liked it when Grog got it on with a, what was it, a nymph?
Travis: What?
Matt: Yeah!
Travis: You don't know man, I went through the portal, handled my business like a champ.
Liam: In the air.
Travis: I don't kiss and tell. Nobody knows. I got what we were supposed to get.
Liam: A nymph could have attacked us, but Grog looked her in the eye, and she liked what she saw. Then he disappeared for a little while, and he came back and he was in a really good mood.
Travis: I flashed her the look, man. She was mine, what can I say?
Taliesin: I like the little green gelatinous cubes. I think they're fun, and then if you make 'em right, you can just make 'em out of jello, and eat them when you're done, that's awesome.
Matt: I don't wanna answer that question necessarily, because I might be using them in the campaign at some point.
Orion: Which one?
Matt: Nothing.
Ashley: So that means we haven't used 'em yet.
Matt: But overall, I just love the tarrasque because it's like the game ender. It's the godzilla. It's the one DM's move where he's like, "I'm done with this campaign, hey guys, you're gonna fight a tarrasque, either you're all gonna die, or you beat it, and you beat the game!" So the tarrassque is always fun.
Orion: Is it the final boss?
Liam: I've always been fascinated with the mind flayers. You're fucking throwing an army of them at us. 'Cause they're dangerous.
Matt: Yeah, they're terrible.
Liam: And they're so outside of the norm.
Matt: And hey you stealthed up, and pretty much killed one in one round today.
Orion: That was insane. When the mud on the face, and the stab in the fucking back of the head.
Matt: You guys black ops'ed that entire barracks.
Liam: I'm proud of the knife.
Taliesin: I know what you're talking about.
Travis: Grog and Scanlan have no bastard children, that we know of. Or that you can prove.
Liam: Other streamed D&D games, like Rollplay hosted by itmejp?
Travis: No.
Liam: No. Maybe we will, though.
Orion: I won't.
Liam: Everyone play Dungeons & Dragons.
Ashley: My favorite NPC character is a little butler who I think became--
Travis: Yes!
Ashley: He's the cutest little thing you will ever see, and I think now he works at--
Taliesin: He works for us now.
Matt: Yep, you guys hired him, and he's currently helping keep your Keep in good shape.
Ashley: What's his name?
Orion: The old fellow, right?
Matt: I'm trying to remember, I'll have to go look at the list again. I have so many NPCs, I have a hard time.
Ashley: He's just the sweetest little thing you ever did see.
Matt: Grog's flatlined intelligence, anything like that happen before? That was the first of that type of situation.
Travis: I went unconscious once 'cause I fell, how far did I fall?
Taliesin: Wow, you fell.
Orion: Oh, that was a crazy one too.
Matt: They were there fighting in an underground cavern, and at the very, very top of this giant, like 170-foot ceiling, which they had all kinda floated up to, and put a rope, anchor in.
Travis: I was ready to Toro the bull.
Matt: The first umber hulk you guys ever encountered, ended up pushing Grog out of the hole, bullrushing him. Had the rope tied around his waist, but unfortunately Grog weighs about 600 pounds, rope snapped, and he took enough damage to go from full health to unconscious and bleeding out in one round.
Marisha: 'Cause he confused you, right? And you just hari-karied off the hole?
Travis: I was gonna dodge and be all awesome, and say ole or some shit, but I was just out.
Marisha: That was when I was a spider tiger. 'Cause I cast Spider Climb on myself, and I was in tiger form, so I was spider climbing all over the place.
Matt: That's also one of my favorite risky rolls, which was after that happened, Tiberius, you pushed the umber hulk onto the ground, or through the hole, it fell.
Orion: I had this amazing spell with Pathfinder called Aquasphere, orb, and you can like, capture large creatures. I literally can waterbend a sphere and carry this dude and drop them down, it was amazing, I miss it so much. Continue the story.
Matt: So essentially Tiberius decided, 'cause Grog was unconscious, and the creature was down there. All of them were stuck 170 feet up, in this little hive essentially. Tiberius said fuck it, he jumped out of the hole, swan dove down, and cast Featherfall on himself at the last minute, had to make a concentration check because of the wind rushing past, and having to cast a spell while falling. It's a very difficult thing. He had about a 40% chance of success, 60% chance of instant death, and he made the roll. I love risky moments like that so much, I love 'em.
Travis: It was pretty legit.
Orion: I did it again and held that fucker, it was intense.
Marisha: I'm wondering when we're gonna face a beholder.
Matt: That'll be nasty.
Marisha: That's my favorite D&D monster.
Orion: With all the eyes?
Marisha: They're like a big floating head with a giant eye, and they've got tentacles, with eyes on the end of 'em, and each eyeball does a different ray of effect.
Travis: A beholder?
Matt: Nasty.
Travis: You know what that is too?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: They're nasty.
Ashley: Bad news bears.
Marisha: They're super awesome. One of these days we're gonna fight one.
Matt: One of these days.
Liam: They're a signature character of Dungeons & Dragons. They represent D&D.
Travis: What made the dwarves get bigger today in the battle?
Matt: That's actually an ability of the duergar.
Liam: Viagra.
Matt: Yeah. They can summon through sheer force of will, and just the way they've been bred over time, they can increase their form for a short time to increase their damage, and be just a general asshole, so. It's an ability the duergar have.
Travis: Long lost son.
Liam: I'm gonna guess that none of us have been to Sweden?
Matt: I have.
Ashley: My dad was from Sweden.
Matt: That's awesome. I've been to Gothenberg.
Taliesin: That's not surprising.
Orion: I have not, but I would like to go.
Marisha: Yeah, who wouldn't want to go to Sweden?
Liam: Makes sense. Pale and blonde.
Matt: Have you been?
Ashley: Never been.
Matt: It's beautiful, I spent two weeks in Gothenberg, Sweden, on business years ago. It was gorgeous. Food was amazing. Nothing like walking down the street and seeing a giant gothic stone structure with an archway and a gargoyle perched, and you walk in and it's a 7-Eleven. It's pretty hilarious. All the architecture there is old, but it's been repurposed, it's great.
Liam: If you had to choose would you pick to receive an extra level, or Matt's hair?
Matt: God damn it.
Liam: Matt's hair. (all laugh)
Ashley: Hair, obviously.
Marisha: Receive an extra level or Matt's hair.
Travis: You can't get hair like this without unicorn blood. My God.
Matt: I'm gonna shave my head one of these days.
Liam: Shave his head, he can't DM anymore.
Matt: I'd wither. It's like Sampson. I would just like become this little raisin, I'd be David Tennant.
Liam: The beholder strikes for the-- mawp. Mawp.
Matt: Let's see. What are the questions we got up there?
Marisha: It is 11 38, by the way.
Liam: What is the most outrageous and unexpected thing to come from a natural 20? That was Scanlan.
Ashley: Probably the--
Liam: Scanlan as Burt Reynolds.
Marisha: Oh right.
Matt: We'll take about five more minutes of questions. Five or ten more minutes of questions, then we gotta take off.
Liam: How long will you be doing this show? 30 years.
Matt: Considering we've been playing for two and a half years, and everyone's level nine, we can keep going for quite some time. Whether or not we continue past that, means either we do a new campaign, or we go into epic or mythic levels? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I mean, I'd love to keep playing for as long as people wanna play, but also people get busy, life changes, we'll see how it goes. I'm in for the long haul as much as everyone else is.
Liam: Matt, multiple people are asking what the music is that we're hearing on the show.
Matt: What you hear in the show is a combination of a gentlemen named Kevin Macleod, who has a website called Incompetech, which he produces really amazing, royalty-free musical tracks. I've used them for many web series for many years. He's very talented, and I contacted him, and asked him permission to use on the stream. He's like, "yeah, anything on Twitch, go for it." And the other half are a lot of soundscapes I use from a company called Platemail Games, which make great custom RPG soundscapes, and some tracks that are just creepy, and dwarf cityscapes, and dark forest night. It's a great, great resource. Those are my two big ones for this Twitch stream.
Orion: And yes, we did roll for our starting stats.
Matt: Yeah it was 4d6, drop the lowest, arrange as desired. So it was a powerful campaign.
Liam: What was the most nail-biting moment the group has seen? It was Pike's death.
Marisha: Pike dying.
Matt: Definitely. Do you prefer being the DM, or do you like mixing it up and being characters? I never get a chance to play games really. It's kind of one of those, always a DM, never a bride circumstance.
Liam: You wanna play with my kid?
Matt: Yeah. I'll be an evil character and murder them all, you're going to regret it immediately, make 'em just cry.
Liam: "Listen, that's the game, suck it up!"
Matt: Yeah, turn it into Mazes and Monsters.
Taliesin: Is that why you play so much War Machine, is because for once you don't have to be responsible?
Matt: Probably. I occasionally, I got to play a game of Diaspora for a while, with Philip Eisner, the guy who wrote Event Horizon. So playing a sci-fi kind of horror-based universe with him running, that was great. That was very brief.
Liam: Matt, can you give us any teasers of things to come?
Matt: No. See as they happen, man, that's part of the fun, the mystery of it all. I know what's coming. I got stuff planned for years. It's gonna be fun.
Liam: Do you have any advice to get into voice acting? Learn to act, study acting, go to where the work is, keep acting, in anything, in fucking anything. Go to where the work is. Act.
Matt: What age did you play your first tabletop RPG game? For me it was Second Edition Dungeons & Dragons, and it was freshman year of high school.
Taliesin: GURPS, 13. I was, yeah, 13 years old, GURPS.
Ashley: Favorite tabletop games, not D&D?
Liam: Get Hulk Hogan to play.
Orion: That's not D&D?
Taliesin: Mansions of Madness.
Marisha: Mansions of Madness is great.
Orion: Is MTG, Magic the Gathering a tabletop? Is that considered tabletop?
Marisha: It's a card building game.
Orion: Magic.
Marisha: War Machine.
Matt: War Machine is really fun.
Marisha: I'm a Cryx player.
Matt: It's awesome.
Ashley: I'm just starting.
Matt: You're the awesome Retribution.
Orion: I'm Circle of Orboros.
Taliesin: We played with Scanlan, of course we do.
Travis: It said do you ever think about sexuality while playing, besides Grog, of course. Scanlan does, I'm sure other people have.
Taliesin: It's hard not to think about it with Sam.
Travis: We just pay for it.
Liam: Are we gonna release more background information of your campaign?
Matt: Yes, actually.
Liam: We are?
Matt: Time has been hard, but I'm trudging through. What I'm gonna make essentially is a video recap of the previous two and a half years of the campaign. I'm gonna narrate it, it's gonna be very simple. It's gonna be just information, with the occasional slides of stuff in the background. But I'm working on a video, kind of like your guys' intros, that'll be a synopsis of the story up until this stream stared.
Travis: Claymation, that's awesome, man.
Matt: I will destroy you, I will fucking stab you.
Liam: If you want, it's not much, but I have a Vine account that's under the name VoiceofOBrien, and I took a lot of Vine videos from our private game. So it's not a ton, but you'll see us acting like shitheads.
Travis: That's seven seconds at a time.
Marisha: Seven seconds at a time, yeah. I think I still have the video of you trying to woo the nymph lady.
Travis: Try?
Taliesin: That was a good video.
Marisha: It's basically just you flirting with my boyfriend.
Taliesin: I have some videos of the tarot game, and a couple of us
Travis: Matt is now a nymph.
Matt: Yeah, we sat there, and, hey man, I've had to flirt with quite a few of these people as characters, it's interesting.
Liam: Who's your favorite NPC that you brought to life for us?
Matt: Oh, that's a tough one. There's been a lot of good ones. I really enjoyed Grimthorn, the dwarf that was--
Liam: Clarota is pretty good.
Matt: Yeah, Clarota is great. He was the one eyed dwarf with the shave, that was taking you guys to the fighting ring. He was fun. I'm enjoying Balgus as well, he's a good one.
Marisha: Ballsack.
Liam: Ballsack.
Marisha: Do we have nicknames for all of our NPCs?
Matt: You know, I really enjoy Arcanist Allura Visoren.
Orion: So do I!
Matt: She's an awesome, powerful, headstrong elven sorceress, who is part of a, not a secret, but a very powerful circle of magic practitioners around the world, and also a member of the council of Tal'Dorei. She's one of the largest allies that this group has had through a lot of the adventure arcs, and I love playing her, she's great.
Liam: Grog, have you even thrown a gnome as an attack.
Travis: The very first time we played, I picked up Sam and chucked him across a room. That was full of a trap.
Marisha: Fastball special.
Travis: And it worked. It was awesome.
Matt: What character type would I play if I ever got a chance to play? I would probably be a bard. I wanna make a bard that actually conducts the battle. Meaning, sits there and watches the fight, and he's conducting, like music happens when other people attack. Cymbals go off, and drum beats, and all of his abilities are tied to music, so he's actually conducting the battle like a symphony. That's what I wanna make.
Marisha: That's cool.
Ashley: That's badass.
Matt: One day.
Liam: Would you ever play an evil character? My contingency plan, if I get killed, I don't know about evil, but he won't be as nice as Vax.
Matt: Evil characters have to be discussed with the DM. I'm iffy on the evil character, unless they have a good reason, and a personality that isn't going to completely derail the campaign. Doing an evil campaign, that's fine. But if you're building a character that is going to inherently be a troll, and basically diminish everybody else's good time in the story, it becomes a problem.
Zac: It's the internet though, man.
Matt: I know. If you make a cool, interesting evil character, that can be evil but still like, like a good example would be in Baldur's Gate, Edwin.
Zac: What if one of your guests, that came on for one night, would they be allowed to be?
Matt: Yeah, they'd be allowed to. They may not survive.
Orion: Tiberius might not--
Marisha: Or kill them.
Liam: I don't know about evil, but if I have to come back, I might be a lot more selfish.
Matt: In it cool news, tabletop columnist, offering to DM a game for me. I may have to hit you up on that some time. 'Cause that'd be awesome.
Taliesin: He deserves a break.
Zac: How do you remember all the voices that you've done of the NPC's over the years?
Matt: I make notes and audio files.
Travis: You do?
Matt: I do. As a reminder in case I forget.
Travis: Jarvis. (all laugh)
Matt: I have notes written next to every NPC, like an accent or dialect that I chose for them, a general texture. Kind of like what you'd see for breakdowns for a character you're auditioning for. I basically make that for each NPC to remind me of what I've done. And if it's a particularly weird voice that I don't know if I could replicate in the future, after the session I'll go and do a little audio file of me doing the voice so I can go back to it later.
Travis: You're a freak of nature, man.
Taliesin: Seriously.
Matt: Good question.
Marisha: There's a lot that goes into it. I think Matt, just to put it into perspective, for everyone in the chat room, I think Matt probably spends close to eight hours, at least, on each time before we play. Or I guess at least we used to.
Matt: For our big session, I'd spend as much time preparing as we did playing. I'll put it that way, I spend as much time preparing as we play. So for these sessions, I'm spending about three hours a week, preparing, what, three to four hours a week? For old sessions that was bigger.
Liam: Someone asked, what was the reaction to discovering you had a magic flying carpet? Which you can see if you go to Matt's YouTube channel. There's a video that Ashley made of us playing, and you see our reactions to that.
Marisha: Who was it, was it you, or Vex? That tried to float down with the carpet, and then we realized it was magic?
Liam: Yeah, underneath.
Marisha: But we tried to just use it like a parachute.
Matt: It was a crumbling tower, it was Allura's tower. You guys went into, realized she was missing, because the tower had been attacked. You set off essentially a defense system of her arcane tower, which caused it to crumble into a tiny pearl.
Orion: Tiberius jumped out the window and just cast Featherfall.
Matt: Yeah, and just kinda glided away. You turned into an eagle and grabbed the gnomes. The rest of the party had to try to rapidly escape a crumbling tower that was compacting on to itself.
Marisha: I think it was mainly the twins in the tower.
Liam: Hey, Grog almost died once. He fell from a great--
Matt: You fall a lot, but when you fall on to something, that thing is fucked.
Matt: All right, we're winding down here, 'cause we gotta leave here shortly guys. Two more questions.
Liam: Three more questions.
Zac: Closing messages before you guys go, too.
Matt: Oh yeah, all right, so we'll do a couple more questions, then we'll go to closing messages. Who wants to pick?
Liam: Let's make it a magic three.
Marisha: Let's do a good one.
Matt: Three, three questions, make 'em quick. Let's see.
Marisha: Waiting for a good one.
Matt: How much does Grog weigh? Grog weighs approximately 600 pound we decided.
Travis: Just under 700.
Matt: So he's kinda rough.
Travis: It's all muscle, bitch.
Matt: Yeah it is. Muscle and brains.
Travis: Muscle and wang. 500 pounds and a hundred-pound wang.
Matt: Any of you consider running a game for fans of the stream? Actually, I've run a couple games at conventions for some groups. I had a couple of sessions I ran, actually in conjunction with Wizards, they sent stuff out for us.
Taliesin: And for charity.
Matt: Yeah, we've had some charity D&D games out here in L.A. So we've done them before. I'd consider it if there was time available, and a venue that allowed it. So if it does happen, we'll definitely announce it here.
Travis: Best item in your inventory?
Orion: That's for a magic item?
Travis: Oh, did we already say that? I'm just blanking.
Orion: No.
Taliesin: It's hard to read this quickly.
Matt: You guys have some good questions.
Travis: My brain's turning into applesauce.
Ashley: I know, me too.
Liam: Do you realize how lucky you all are to have such a nice group of friends?
All: Yes.
Matt: Very much so.
Taliesin: The world is cold and unfeeling.
Liam: Let's close it on that. I love these guys.
Matt: And I like to think that this is, because there are so many good people out there in the world, and we were lucky enough to find each other through weird circumstances. And there are so many good people in the world out there, don't close yourself off to it. You'd be surprised how many awesome--
Travis: How long does it usually take the woman in the back to tie her boot?
Marisha: I'm multi-tasking.
Matt: No, that's the question we end it on. That's the question.
Marisha: I've just been tightening my laces while I've been kicking it back here.
Zac: I'm gonna squeeze in here really quick. So I have some thank you's I wanna call out while you guys are here. I figured they'd appreciate me calling them out the most while you guys were on screen. 'Cause they like you guys for some reason.
All: Aw.
Zac: So these are all people that have sent us stuff off Amazon, to help make the studio better. So Danielle Denny.
Ashley: Thanks Danielle!
Matt: Danielle, thank you so much Danielle.
Zac: Bradley Dealman?
Marisha: Dalman.
Matt: Bradley Dalman.
Liam: Do we know what they sent us? Can you tell us some of the things they sent?
Zac: I have, I-- Well I mean they're like-- new microphones for that station and lights.
Marisha: That's amazing.
Zac: Wii controllers.
Matt: Brad, thank you, that's amazing.
Zac: And other stuff for tech we needed that we didn't have. Shane and Russell said thanks for all your hard work, and everything you are doing.
Matt: Aw. Thank you Shane!
Zac: Ty Odlinger.
Ashley: Ty!
Zac: Timothy B. Hudson.
Ashley: Timothy!
Zac: Timothy B. Hudson, he went nuts.
Matt: Timothy!
Taliesin: Triple threat.
Zac: Kathel T. Stockdale.
Ashley: Cool name, Kathel.
Zac: Yeah, that's rad. Luis Archuletta.
Matt: Luis Archeletta!
Ashley: Luis!
Zac: Steve Chua.
Matt: Steve!
Zac: Here's a little something to help you guys out. Another one from Chua, here's a little something to help you guys out. And I know there's more coming in, this is what we've got so far. Thanks everybody.
Matt: That's so cool guys, thank you.
Zac: And they also have asked that a couple of you guys come on Honesty Hour sometime.
Liam: What is that?
Zac: It's a show I do on Monday nights, where it's 100% no-holds-barred. I will answer any question that they ask.
Travis: What?
Orion: I would love to do that.
Travis: Sounds like a horrifying idea.
Zac: Okay, they've asked specifically for Ashley, they've asked for Matt, and as for, actually I think everyone has been asked at one point in time. So I'll say maybe I'll have you guys once a month.
Ashley: When is Honesty Hour?
Zac: It's usually Monday nights from nine to, whenever the fuck. Like it went to 1:30AM the other night.
Crew: Isn't it really an Honesty Time?
Zac: Don't do it! It's only for subscribers. It's not that bad, because they ask really great questions, a lot of them have been about how have you gotten through certain aspects of depression, or what kind of thing--
Marisha: Oh that's good.
Zac: It's pretty inspirational.
Liam: How many times have you been hit in the nuts in your life?
Zac: I can say twice. And would probably explained how it happened, and what I did. It's just story time. Sometimes the questions get a little inappropriate.
Matt: That's okay.
Zac: That's fine.
Matt: But like for the most part, the audience here's been so awesome, they're all super intelligent with great questions. I'd be down, I'd totally be down.
Ashley: Wait, is this Noncompliant?
Zac: Yeah.
Matt: Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, I got the Noncompliant tattoo this week, actually.
Marisha: Oh yeah, I saw your picture.
Ashley: That's amazing.
Zac: We have a comic book show on Tuesday.
Travis: (air-horn sound)
Zac: Real talk with Zac. But thank you guys so much for doing this. The subscribers really wanted to do it, so hopefully you guys enjoyed as well. And we will come back next week.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Yay!
Zac: Tomorrow, if you guys are at Wonder Con, are any of you guys gonna be at Wonder Con?
Taliesin: Saturday.
Marisha: I don't know, maybe.
Orion: I'll be there Saturday.
Matt: I'm sadly not gonna be there.
Zac: I will be there tomorrow from 12:30 to one, for a meet and greet, which I'm going to pretend is an autograph signing, and I'm going to bring my own pictures.
Matt: Yeah!
Zac: We're gonna have fun with it. Going in costume. Becca and I are going in costume, and then Hector and Ify will be at four. And then Hector and Ify are doing a Q and A, or no, a trivia game that night on the stage for Geek & Sundry and stuff like that. So Geek & Sundry will be there, you guys should stop by.
Liam: Thanks for all those greater than three's, guys.
Matt: Less than three's.
Taliesin: Greater than three, too.
Zac: The computer, the story behind that, is during the charity drive, we had a robot read off all the donation messages. And the robot would say, and when they made a heart, it would say, "we less than three."
Matt: So beautiful.
Zac: So we turned that into a thing.
Liam: (robot voice) We less than three you.
Matt: It fucks me up every time you do that.
Zac: Cool. Thanks guys!
Taliesin: Forgot you speak-and-spell.
Zac: Thank you so much.
Marisha: Bye.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone, to the next episode of Critical Role! This week, we have a full party. We'll be continuing just after the climactic battle with the twisted beholder, K'varn. We're going to go ahead and play a couple of videos here while we're waiting for the rest of the party members to settle in, so we'll be back here in just a few minutes. Sit tight and we'll get this party started. We have some fun announcements, some cool gifts that came in we'll be opening towards the end of the session today, but we'll go into those details shortly, so see you in a little bit. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn!
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods; she preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, guys! Welcome back. Thank you for your patience. We have the whole group, finally seem to have defeated the horrible atrocity that is 13th-level Los Angeles traffic. (cheering)
Zac: What's up, internet? I've got a quick announcement.
Matt: Yes.
Zac: Guys, we have a big giveaway today, when we get to 3,300 subscribers. I think we're 50 away or around 48, something like that. When we get to 3,300, we're giving away a dice box, a signed t-shirt, a starter set, and a signed Player's Handbook all in one box for a lucky winner, so if you guys get those subscribers rolling in, that's what helps pay for this show and pay for the entire channel as a whole, so get on that! And we wanted to say thank you to Aaron's Books in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania for sending us this stuff to give away to you guys. (cheering)
Matt: Seriously guys, seriously, that was so cool of you to send that out there, and we want to say, happy sixth graduation, Aaron, congrats to you, well done. (cheering)
Zac: Aaron's a little young to be running a bookstore. That's all I have to say.
Matt: I consider that a very fine entrepreneurial position. You're getting started young, good man.
Zac: So guys, enjoy the game.
Matt: Thank you so much, and thank you again, Aaron and Aaron's books. That's awesome, guys.
Travis: Who was that strange masked man just now?
Matt: I don't know, it's so weird. Okay, so a couple quick things. First off, thank you guys for coming back and watching. Last week we had a few members away, so we had a fun little mini-game with a few folks, some who had played before, some who hadn't, and it turned out very interestingly. I hope my DM's tips were helpful for some folks out there. There's been some great feedback, and hopefully we'll do more things like that in the future for off-days. So, thanks to you. Welcome back, we're getting back into the main story line. Couple other quick things I wanted to mention: first off a big shout-out, birthday shout-out to Kit Buss, our fantastic artist for the show. (cheering)
Travis: Happy Birthday, Kit!
Orion: We love you, Kit.
Ashley: Happy birthday!
Matt: She's awesome, she's amazing, and I've seen a couple little previews of the next piece of art she's been working on and it looks pretty awesome. I think you guys are going to dig it. So she's not done, when she's finished drinking her birthday shots, then I think we'll hopefully see that soon. (laughs) Awesome, thank you so much, Kit!
Marisha: Yes, shots first, then draw.
Matt: Exactly, it's priorities! Also, anyone have any announcements they want to mention before we start the game? Any upcoming stuff?
Travis: The Justice League thing!
Matt: That's true, yeah! DC Kids on Youtube just released their new Super Friends animated series that both me and Travis are in.
Orion: Who are you? Who do you guys play?
Matt: Well, you play Lex Luthor.
Travis: Lex Luthor, and you play Superman.
Orion: Son of a bitch!
Sam: Interesting choice.
Taliesin: You can feel the tension.
Matt: It's a really, really cute show, it's a lot of fun, it's very much a playback to the classic Super Friends cartoon, that kind of comedic atmosphere. You should check it out.
Sam: You're Superman?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: (Clarota voice) Does he talk like this?
Matt: Yeah, it gets a little weird around episode three. I don't think DC's happy with how we treated the license for that one. (laughter)
Travis: That's the best.
Matt: That's every character I do now. Matthew Mercer, reading for Superman: (croaking noise) Also, if anyone else has any other announcements they want to mention?
Marisha: Yeah!
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: You go first.
Orion: Whatchamacallit, a few weeks ago me and Matthew wore these really cool shirts with the vermilion bird from Rubrum, which is in Type-0, the Final Fantasy that we're both in! That shirt was made from Greven, g-r-e-v-e-n, at Redbubble, and we wanted to thank him for those shirts, along with this awesome Final Fantasy shirt, made by August8913, where she did this super cool, it says Nine on the back, his says Trey. Thank you guys, for the really cool shirts.
Travis: Aw, yeah! Jumped on the jam, boogie-woogie jam-slam.
Marisha: I'm going to be at Lock and Load this weekend in Seattle, which is the War Machine Hordes con for Privateer Press.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah! It's awesome, I'm going to be dressed up in my Scar costume. It's going to be awesome, I'm going to be doing a big transformation with Espionage. Yeah, and we're actually going to be pushing the stream; they're going to be streaming it and Geek&Sundry is going to be hosting the Lock and Load stream, so tune in and watch me prance around at Lock and Load in Seattle.
Taliesin: Those are impressive shoes to prance in, by the way.
Marisha: Yeah, some intense stripper heels, yeah.
Orion: Who'd you play?
Matt: Kreoss.
Orion: You were Kreoss, by the way, War Machine Tactics, Matthew Mercer is Kreoss.
Matt: Kreoss, Asphyxius, couple other guys.
Orion: Yeah, yeah, check it out.
Matt: It's fun, it's on Steam.
Liam: Asphyxius?
Matt: Asphysius is the character's name, lich lord Asphyxius, he's bad in town.
Marisha: I'm Haley and Deneghra and Fiora.
Laura: We're going to be at MetroCon next weekend.
Matt: Awesome! MetroCon next weekend.
Travis: (sings) In Tampa.
Laura: (sings) In Tampa, Florida.
Travis: Tampa, Florida.
Matt: Okay. Real fast, before we get to that, I will be, for those who are near--
Marisha: You already did it?
Travis: How many did we have to go?
Zac: 50.
Laura: Ridiculous.
Marisha: 50 subscribers.
Matt: Well, we already hit the mark!
Marisha: Don't we normally hit that in, like, a show?
Matt: That works, you guys are amazing!
Ashley: Yes, that's awesome!
Orion: Thank you, everyone!
Matt: I'll finish my last announcement, then we'll go to that.
Zac: I'm going to go ahead and start the giveaway.
Matt: Go, start the giveaway!
Travis: When is the next giveaway?
Zac: We're going to do-- Those pictures already exist, they shared them with the chatroom. Yeah, so we're going to do this. We're going to do a whole other set of these when we get to the next 50.
Marisha: Oh, a whole other set? There's another one?
Zac: Technically, we have four sets.
Liam: See you in five minutes.
Matt: So we have four sets of those to give away. Every 50 subscribers another set goes out, guys, so that's amazing.
Orion: I could have Sam fart on this for you, if you want.
Sam: Again? Already done, friend, already done.
Matt: Whoa. Okay, there we go. (laughs)
Travis: The world just ended.
Matt: That was close. I just rolled a one on my camera save. Final announcement before we get to the game, for those who are-- (shushing noises)
Orion: Sorry. Okay.
Matt: Can't all talk at once. Also, this weekend I'll be in Sandusky, Ohio, at Colossal Con along with such great folks as Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Blum, other fun greats--
Travis: Is that at the water park?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Son of a bitch.
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, because water parks are totally sanitary. Hot tub's going to be great.
Travis: The dysentery afterwards is--
Zac: Flyingsquid63 is the winner.
All: Flyingsquid63!
Matt: You are the winner of the first set. Congratulations, that's awesome.
Ashley: It's an awesome name.
Marisha: Oh look, and it's green. You're winning green speckled dice, like squid colors.
Matt: There you go, that worked out well, very Cthulhu-ian.
Marisha: I'm justifying. Shut up, Liam! (laughter)
Matt: Well awesome, so we hit our next 50, we'll do another giveaway, we have three more of those packages to give out, guys, so hopefully keep that up. All right, anything else or should we get back into the chaos?
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: I'm scared!
Matt: You should be.
Ashley: I really am.
Sam: We beat the bad guy! It's fine, it's all fine.
Matt: Where we left off.
Orion: I forgot to ask you something before the game, it's fine.
Matt: It's okay. The party, as they ventured deep into the Underdark beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, they sought and discovered Lady Kima of Vord, a folk hero, a paladin of Bahamut who had been captured and tortured by the duergar that lived beneath it. After saving her, they discovered that there was an even deeper, darker, more dangerous evil brewing beneath the surface. There was an illithid, or mind flayer, city of Yug'voril deeper within these cavern structures, and currently the Elder Brain of the colony was under the control of an entity known as K'Varn, they came to find out was a self-mutilated and advanced beholder, who had come into contact with a dark artifact known as the Horn of Orcus that was actually gifted many many, many many, like hundreds of years ago by the god of undeath himself, Orcus, to one of his avatars. Somehow it found its way to this beholder, and gave it enough power to where it gained complete dominion over this colony and these caverns as a whole. The party fought their way through and made a few allies, including the ousted mind flayer, Clarota, seeking to return to his colony, has been fighting alongside them, as well as Lady Kima, the paladin they came to save. Upon finding their way into the final cavern, they used their magic carpet to completely go around the giant city of Yug'Voril, perch on top of the temple in the center of the city, and using a polymorphed fomorian giant (laughs), cascading down hundreds upon hundreds of feet, through the glass structure on top, managed to break their way into the temple, after which a very dangerous battle with K'Varn the beholder took place. A number of very close calls. I posted the stats for them after the fight, if any of you guys got a chance to see it. They made saving throws where it counted, or we'd have a lot more party members that'd be permanently dead. But they managed to take him out; using Tiberius's Telekinesis, they tore the horn from its forehead and the beholder fell to the ground, unmoving and finally killed, as opposed to its undead form, and that's where we begin. As you guys all sit there looking around yourselves, adrenaline still pumping in your ears, the flow of blood.
Orion: Pike--
Ashley: That's me! What do you need?
Orion: Do you have spell of Restoration, the thing that can reverse stone?
Ashley: Yes, I do.
Orion: Clarota, what do you suggest we do? Do we stay, do we leave, or do we-- what do you? There are hundreds upon thousands of illithid rushing at us right now, and they don't like me very much, by the way--
Laura: We should get out of here!
Matt: At which point, Clarota turns to you and says, "You. Bring her." Points to Kima, who is still frozen in stone mid-wielding her maul.
Ashley: To carry her?
Matt: "Stay but a moment; I will talk to them."
Sam: Talk to the hive.
Orion: Very good. Wait, do you want her un-stoned, or still stoned?
Marisha: Well, hang on. Maybe before we unstone Kima, we talk about what we should do with the Horn.
Orion: This is exactly what has to do with the Horn. Is there any way, Pike, could you perhaps half-cast it and hold the spell, don't quite undo her legs from stone, I don't want her to be mobile. I want to ask her--
Ashley: I don't know if I--
Sam: If I may, very quickly, are you with us, Tiberius?
Orion: We will discuss that when we get out of here.
Sam: Because you disappeared for like, the whole fight. Are you with us?
Orion: I am with you.
Sam: Are you going to disappear again?
Orion: To be fair, Scanlan, I never disappeared to begin with!
Sam: Well, you weren't there when we needed you the most. You were out doing God-knows-what.
Orion: Quite the contrary. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be fighting that damn thing.
Sam: What on earth are you talking about?
Orion: Silence. (laughter)
Sam: Dispel Magic. Yes, I did.
Orion: Counterspell.
Sam: Do I have a will save?
Orion: No, you're done, you're quiet.
Matt: That low enough level? No, unfortunately.
Orion: The idea, which I will share-- we don't have time to do that--
Sam: I turn him into a goat.
Orion: He has to say that, it doesn't work.
Matt: I know that. (laughter)
Orion: So the idea is, Pike, if we ask her why she wants the horn, if there is any other reason but to destroy it, we have to--
Sam: Okay, then I'll Banish him.
Laura: (gasps)
Ashley: How about-- well, hold on.
Taliesin: He can't stop it, he can't talk!
Matt: Also requires verbal casting.
Sam: I have to touch him, right?
Matt: You also have to be able to speak.
Sam: Fuck!
Matt: So while you're talking to them, Scanlan is tapping you and mouthing words angrily.
Orion: The idea is, if she doesn't want to destroy it, I say there's something awful, and Keyleth, I believe you want to destroy it, yes?
Marisha: Well, yes, I mean why does she want to take it back up to the surface if it's that terrible?
Orion: I know this is, did you say Orcus, is that his name?
Matt: Orcus, yes.
Orion: This thing is no good at all.
Marisha: Why don't we just throw it in some lava?
Orion: Where is some lava? I would much like to do that.
Marisha: Well, we're around lava, right?
Travis: We were.
Laura: We're not around lava now.
Taliesin: It's a thing of earth. Perhaps taking it to the surface is necessary to destroy it. Why don't we have a conversation with her?
Orion: But she wanted to take it back to Emon. That is not appropriate, we need to destroy this.
Taliesin: Let's get some information first.
Orion: I dispel Silence.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's get some information, let's figure out--
Sam: Oh hi, hi there.
Orion: Sorry, I just wanted to get the point across.
Ashley: I can un-stone her.
Taliesin: We'll un-stone her, it's not like she can take it from us.
Ashley: That's my last 5th-level spell, so we might need to rest.
Taliesin: If something horrible happens, we're going to run anyway at this point.
Matt: I assume you guys have come down in here then.
Orion: I'm staying up, can I not--
Sam: Then how did we have this whole conversation?
Orion: Oh, then I'd be down there.
Laura: I was planning on staying up. I'm not leaving Trinket up there.
Matt: Okay. Good.
Taliesin: Why don't we find out what happens next? And if we have to, you can teleport us out of here, correct?
Orion: Oh, I have a wonderful escape plan.
Marisha: Okay, so Clarota, how much time do we have before something happens next?
Matt: As you say that, Clarota turns, and the two stone doorways on each side of the temple shift open and you notice three mind flayers glide in from the side of the room.
Laura: I notch my arrow.
Orion: No, no! Stop, no don't. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Matt: Two small, bi-pedal, brain-like creatures.
All: No! No.
Matt: At which point, Clarota puts his hands up like this.
Travis: I'm grappled, so.
Matt: Yeah, you're still being held back, but you can try to break from the grapple if you want to roll an athletics check.
Travis: (laughs) I would like to, just because these things ate my fucking mind away. Seven.
Matt: Nope, you're still held against the bars.
Taliesin: You're like an extra in Big Trouble in Little China.
Travis: Oh, it's a 12! I looked at acrobatics.
Matt: Still not enough, unfortunately.
Ashley: Wait, but I cast-- nope, never mind! Keep going!
Matt: Okay. As they begin to move in, and are hovering forward, looking around the room, taking in the scenery, but they're all focused toward the center, they're all just moving towards the Elder Brain. And they make their way up towards it, looking very intent and very frightened at the prospect of what maybe has happened in this room. As they all approach, you can see that low, dull, kind of purplish glow of the Elder Brain is still pumping, but slowly brighter and brighter, almost like it's coming to more life. You can hear the cage rattling of the various entities that are still inside, like the one that's still grappling Grog off to the side. The horn of Orcus, which is still being held aloft by your Telekinesis spell, is just hovering through the air, slowly rotating on its own, little strips of K'Varn's flesh still freshly tumbling from the side.
Orion: And it's at the halfway point between where she is and where I'm standing.
Matt: So right here?
Orion: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Not this big, of course.
Orion: It's really heavy, guys!
Matt: As they all move towards the center, Clarota, with his hands up, turns around, pulls back the hood, and steps towards the other mind flayers, hands stretched out, moving up to the point here.
Ashley: (whispers) Can you instill an inspiration?
Sam: Inspire him? I think he's pretty good on his own.
Orion: "Don't do anything." I'm saying this on the ears.
Matt: The three illithid look over and notice Clarota, and there's a good 20 or 30 seconds of silence as they just look at each other. At which point, Clarota kind of turns around to the rest of the group and looks at them, looks at all of you and lowers his head a little bit as the mind flayers move in towards Clarota, one reaches over and pulls the cap from the back of his head, removes it, at which point Clarota raises up, and if you think you've ever seen an entity with tentacles for a mouth smile, the creases in his awful, rubbery, fleshy face almost give a look of joy, of rediscovered connection, and he looks out to the rest of you and bows a head for a second. I need Grog, Scanlan, Tiberius, Vax, and Pike to all make--
Travis: Tiberius, if he fucks us.
Sam: I think he's about to.
Matt: Intelligence saving throws.
Travis: Oh, I'm grappled! I'm raging, but. Fuck yes! Intelligence saving throws?
Matt: Intelligence saving throws.
Travis: Thank god I rolled high.
Orion: Natural 20.
Travis: (laughs) I get a negative two modifier, that's such bullshit. (laughter)
Matt: Not very wise, there, Grog.
Travis: 17.
Sam: Is this a charm?
Matt: This would be-- no, it would not be.
Marisha: So wait, am I still an elemental? Is that the deal?
Orion: It's 23.
Matt: 23, 20. Scanlan?
Sam: 12.
Matt: 12. Pike?
Laura: She needs better dice.
Ashley: I rolled a six.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Ashley: Six total. (laughs)
Travis: Oh. 17.
Matt: Okay! So. Currently, all the mind flayers at once, including Clarota, angrily lash out with a Mind Blast. You feel your brains all of a sudden fill with searing, horrible pain. Some of you manage to shrug it off, but the rest of you find your bodies locking in place. All right, everyone who failed their save, which would be-- Keyleth, what'd you roll?
Marisha: You didn't have me roll.
Matt: Oh, you need to roll as well, sorry, you're in the blast there. You're still an earth elemental.
Marisha: I thought I was immune to this kind of stuff. (groans) What do I-- not good.
Matt: Not good? All right, that'll be 22 points of psychic damage to Grog, to Pike.
Travis: I passed, right?
Matt: No, you passed this. You're fine.
Laura: Teleport us out of here!
Orion: It doesn't work like that. It's what I was trying to say earlier!
Matt: Scanlan, you are currently stunned, you are actually unable to physically move. Pike, as well. The rest of you manage to resist the Mind Blast, but at this point in time you can now see that this crew, including Clarota, now reconnected with its people, your purpose serving its end, you're about to be swarmed by the rest of the entire city.
Travis: Son of a bitch, taint, fuck!
Matt: Let's roll initiative, guys.
Marisha: We should've gotten out of here!
Travis: I never trusted that Magneto motherfucker! Fuck.
Matt: All right, so. 25 to 20?
Laura: 21.
Marisha: 21, as well.
Matt: Nice. 20 to 15?
Orion: 19.
Taliesin: 17.
Ashley: 16.
Matt: All right, 15 to ten?
Liam: 14.
Sam: 13.
Matt: All right, Grog?
Travis: Eight. Against mind flayers. We're fucking fighting brains and mind flayers again.
Laura: We're all going to die.
Marisha: Okay, wait, you guys run.
Matt: Vex, you're up first.
Marisha: I can start bringing down the palace.
Laura: I'm stuck at the top. Until we can run, we're stuck, because there's only one flying carpet.
Travis: Tiberius has got something for us, right?
Laura: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the Elder Brain and shoot Hail of Thorns into the Elder Brain.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Yes! I like that idea!
Marisha: I'm going to start bringing down the temple! Are we okay with that?
Travis: We're still in it.
Orion: Not while we're still in it.
Marisha: Well, I mean it'll take some time, I'm sure.
Travis: Or it could happen really quick.
Matt: As you guys do notice-- you guys are beginning to see what looks like shadows seemingly coming out from the outside, and you hear what seems to be slight cackling of things sort of in the doorways. So you're shooting Hail of Thorns down into the Elder Brain? Go ahead and roll for the attack.
Laura: 19?
Matt: 19 will hit, yes.
Sam: We're going to be dead in ten minutes.
Matt: What, the teleportation one?
Orion: We'll talk about it later. Plan B, it's ten minutes.
Matt: One minute.
Orion: Sure!
Matt: Pretty sure it's one minute
Marisha: Wait, does this mean you can go and we'll distract?
Orion: No, don't look at it! You said one minute, that's the DM, DM is god.
Laura: Do I roll regular damage, plus the Hail of Thorns?
Matt: I thought it was.
Travis: If someone asks you if you're a god--
All: You say yes.
Travis: You shouldn't look! You shouldn't waste your time.
Matt: Spellcasting time  one minute.
Orion: Oh, yes, I'm so glad I'm wrong.
Laura: 39 on the first hit.
Orion: How many of us are down there?
Ashley: 39?! Yes!
Marisha: All of us except for Laura and Trinket.
Taliesin: And I'm on the carpet, so I can head that direction.
Laura: And then 18 for the second.
Matt: Okay, so you release the first Hail of Thorns. The arrow shatters into a whole--
Laura: And anything within five feet takes damage, as well.
Matt: That'll be all four of them. How much damage do they take?
Laura: They take the same amount unless they make--
Matt: Unless they make a what? Do they have a saving throw against it?
Laura: Oh wait. Yeah. They take half damage on a saving throw.
Matt: Okay. Against what? So two of them make it, two of them don't.
Marisha: Look, look, I do double damage to objects and structures. That's the thing, I'm really good at tearing shit down.
Orion: Now, sometimes fighting isn't the right thing to do!
Marisha: That's why I'm not talking about fighting, I'm talking about collapsing buildings!
Matt: All right, so Clarota and the one nearest to it get behind a pillar for a second and manage to reduce the damage a bit, but the other two are completely pierced all over their bodies where shattered pieces of these kind of jagged thorn arrows exploded all over them and the Elder Brain. The pulsing begins to-- you hear this shrieking in your mind, like the actual presence of the Elder Brain is starting to yell out in pain. You feel it's hardy but hurting. I mean, it's very hefty, it's a large chunk of matter, so god knows how long it would take to take that one down, but it's definitely-- (laughs) it hurt. It's not happy with that. Do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are?
Laura: I want to do my second attack.
Matt: Yeah, that's right!
Laura: Yeah. 15?
Matt: 15 does not hit, unfortunately. You actually fire down and it hits the stonework and the arrow splinters against it. Stay where you are?
Laura: I don't know what else to do. I'm stuck up at the top.
Matt: Jump? What could possibly go wrong! Okay, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Sam: Keyleth!
Marisha: I think my best use-- I agree we need to get out of here, but I'm going to--
Matt: You have shadows moving in from the two open doorways on each side right now.
Marisha: What, so the Elder Brain-- is this a wooden well, or a stone well? What is this?
Matt: Essentially it's a giant stone platform that houses the Elder Brain at the center.
Marisha: Here's what I can do. I can start breaking the well, or I can start blocking entrances. I can start pulling down--
Travis: That one, the second one.
Taliesin: The second one.
Marisha: The second one?
Travis: The second one, close the doorway.
Marisha: All right. Who's coming in from where?
Matt: This is one doorway. That's the other.
Travis: I thought he said it was big.
Marisha: All right, I am going to-- I can make it there, right? That's 35 feet?
Matt: That-- ooh, that's maybe not enough. Yeah no, that's longer than 35 feet.
Laura: Just bull rush and tear down the well.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Fuck it, do what you want to do.
Matt: What do you want to do?
Marisha: All right, all right!
Matt: Just letting you know, just putting this into perspective, here: you're fighting four illithid in the room. You have a city swarming on you right now.
Laura: We need to get out! Or take down the Elder Brain.
Marisha: All right. I am taking down the doors.
Matt: Okay, what are you doing? Are you casting a spell?
Marisha: No, I'm going to start-- can I bull rush, not necessarily right next to the door but like right here, and I'm going to elemental-slam into the wall and siege monster this.
Matt: What's the movement speed of the earth elemental?
Marisha: 35 feet.
Matt: 35 feet? As it's still able to move through stone as well?
Marisha: Yeah! Well, actually, no. When I move through stone I think I can move 60 feet!
Matt: Okay, it is a thick floor. You actually shift into the stonework of the flooring itself and coast through, popping up right out there. That'll get you right at the doorway. You can see there is a slow spiraling incline, like a small-- like an inclined pathway that you can see four illithid making their way up right now, with some large looming stomping sounds coming up behind them.
Marisha: Perfect! So I materialize, using my girth to take up the door, and then I just go (deep voice) boom! And start bringing it down.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make your slam attack or attacks, depending on how many--
Marisha: Slam, I guess.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Get it, Keyleth. (cheering)
Marisha: 26!
Matt: 26, okay go ahead and roll damage on that. Since you are an earth elemental, you do extra siege damage against structures, don't you?
Marisha: Correct. Double damage. So (laughs) okay. So does full damage, plus five, so that's 21-- 42 points of damage.
Ashley: Yes!
Matt: 42 points of damage. So the stone structure, which is pretty rigid and this is an old, old structure; the strange, weird, non-Euclidean design of it has a slight warbling feel to it. You take both of your earth elemental fists and slam them into the side. As you do, the structure gives way and a good 30 feet or so crumbles down around you. You can feel the stones raining onto you. Because of your proximity, you take four points of impact damage.
Marisha: I like it! It feels good! This is what I bathe in!
Matt: This entire doorway is ruined, and there's a good 15-foot pile of stonework now blocking that entranceway.
Marisha: 15-foot pile?
Matt: Yeah. But there's a hole above it, where the stone fell through. So there is about 50 feet up a section of the wall that is collapsed down.
Marisha: Whatever, it'll make it harder. Right, that's my turn.
Matt: Okay, do recall that mind flayers do levitate.
Travis: Aw. (groans) God! Maybe not now, they don't?
Matt: All right, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Yeah, okay--
Matt: You can also see forms swarming through the other doorway over there.
Laura: Teleport us!
Orion: This isn't good.
Laura: Fly us! Get us out.
Orion: How far? Scanlan's only like a foot away from me, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: I'm right next to him!
Matt: Yep.
Orion: Oh!
Travis: Beam us out, Scotty.
Orion: Shit. Okay. I cast Fly on myself.
Sam: (laughs) Bye, Tiberius! (laughter)
Orion: I redact that, actually. Is it possible-- I'm at least standing next to him, right?
Matt: You are.
Orion: I don't have to use a move action right now. I can, like, look at him.
Sam: I leap!
Orion: Okay, can I give him-- can I take off my Ioun Stone as an action, and swap his crown?
Matt: No, I'm pretty sure-- if the item says "attunement" on it, you have to spend a short rest attuning yourself with the weapon. If either of them does.
Orion: But he didn't. He hasn't attuned himself to the thing yet.
Sam: To what?
Matt: Right, but your Ioun stone-- you mean take it from him?
Orion: Yeah!
Matt: You would have to attune it to yourself in order to use it.
Orion: How long does it take?
Matt: It takes a short rest.
Orion: Shit! Okay, that changes everything in a very bad way.
Matt: What are you doing? The other doorway isn't blocked, you have mind flayers running in, you have probably more and more swarming from underneath the temple, probably over at some point, from what you've seen of the temple structure.
Orion: Okay, so I'm going to attempt to crush the Horn. With a thousand pounds of pressure.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Because my Telekinesis is still going.
Matt: That's true.
Orion: I can't do anything else without dropping this thing because as soon as I do anything else, I drop the horn. So I have to do that first.
Matt: Okay, so you use your action, go ahead and roll for that, for the crushing of Telekinesis.
Travis: Oh god.
Orion: What am I adding?
Matt: You're adding your modifier, which I think is five.
Orion: Oh, 23.
Matt: As you focus intensely, you feel that the Horn itself-- the sheer force of the artifact is far too powerful for your meager magic to have any sort of effect on its physical structure.
Orion: I thought so.
Matt: As you focus your arcane intent on crushing it, you feel almost like the back of your brain begins to crawl with cold energy, and if you could hear-- if you could hear laughter come from something that is inanimate, you're hearing it coming from the Horn right now.
Travis: Fuck that horn.
Matt: That's your action.
Orion: I'm going to--
Laura: Float it into the Bag of Holding!
Orion: I'm going to maneuver around the chaos because I'm not within range of anybody to hurt me, right?
Matt: Not currently, no.
Orion: So I'm going to hop on the carpet.
Liam: This is all taking six seconds, by the way.
Matt: 30, that's as far as you can get.
Orion: Well, I can run.
Matt: You already used your action to Telekinesis.
Orion: Oh. That's stupid.
Matt: That's how it works.
Orion: "Hey, Percy!" (laughs) That's my turn, that's all I can do. And I still maintain the thing.
Matt: Okay. That brings us-- end of Tiberius's turn, to Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to start flying straight up, and while I'm flying straight up, I'm going to take... two shots with the Pepperbox at the big brain.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll twice.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Sharpshooter. That's a 21? That's 21.
Matt: 21 does hit.
Taliesin: And should I do both hits?
Matt: Yeah, roll both.
Taliesin: Oh, and-- no, that's right, I don't critical at 19?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: No, I need a specialty. Damn it! And that hits, so both hit, and they're both with Sharpshooter, so that's nice. (sings) I haven't pulled my dice out yet. There we go.
Liam: Come on, gunslinger!
Taliesin: Oh, that's nice! 25 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And 17 points of damage.
Matt: All right, gotcha.
Taliesin: Oh, sorry. I forgot, sorry, four points of fire damage.
Matt: Okay, good. All right, so as you (gunshot) turn over the barrel of your weapon, fire again, the second one bursting into flame as it hits the top of the Elder Brain, you can see both bullets sink into the flesh. There's no impact; they just seem to be absorbed in by it. The flame one, you see a jet of flame go from the inside and the flesh of the actual large Elder Brain quivers for a moment. You hear another shrieking, angry pain growl in your minds just by the proximity of this entity. You don't see it doing too much to it, but it's definitely hurting it. That ends your turn?
Marisha: Things can hurt really bad and not do that much damage.
Matt: Clarota spins and comes up behind you--
Laura: Don't be a dick.
Travis: Remember our days watching Saved by the Bell together?
Matt: You are stunned currently, so it gets advantage on that. So that's 24. All right, so Clarota's tentacles wrap around your head-- (gasping)
Travis: Whose?
Matt: You immediately take 15 points of psychic damage and you are currently grappled.
Sam: And stunned.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: (sings) Grappled and stunned, so grappled and stunned!
Matt: All right, that comes to Pike! Pike, you're stunned currently, mind still reeling from the pain; go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Ashley: Ugh, okay.
Travis: We're just trying to stay alive.
Ashley: I just rolled a one.
Matt: Your physical form is still unable to pull yourself out of that continuous psychic pain, you're like (groans) trying to just tear your mind out of it, unable to do so. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I click my Boots of Haste and I'm going to-- where's the thingie, do we have a thingie here?
Ashley: What do you need?
Liam: The light.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: All right, great. How's this work? Like that. If I can run right between Pike and this little brain jerk right here, does that get me within five feet of Elder Brain if I'm there? I can't tell from the structure.
Matt: You can rush there, you would have to get up onto here.
Liam: Yeah, that's what I want to do, and then, I don't know. That's not my full double-movement, I don't know how that affects the number of attacks I have Hasted, but I just want to stab it as many times as I can, standing on top of this thing.
Matt: All right, got it.
Liam: Where's the meteorite die?
Orion: Fuck you, couch!
Liam: Using my poison dagger.
Travis: Prison shank that thing.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to shiv him in his shank or shank him in his shiv, whichever is the more accurate phrase.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for attack twice.
Travis: Can you scream out "lobotomy" while you do it?
Matt: As a note, as you rush by, for an attack of opportunity, the intellect devourer does reach out and strike at you with its claws.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Rolls a one. You just kick it off to the side, it rolls on its side, its brain matter (clunks) on the ground.
Liam: Do I get two or three attacks?
Matt: You get three if you use your bonus to attack.
Liam: First one misses. Second one is-- oh wait, the first was a 17, is that--
Laura: That doesn't miss.
Liam: Hit or miss, it's a brain, right, I'm standing--
Matt: Total 17? That would still-- it doesn't miss, but as you strike down for it, there's a psychic field that's defending it, and your blade is held at bay by the protective sphere.
Liam: Okay, then I'm using now dagger of venom is 26.
Matt: Okay, that does hit.
Liam: Okay, so that's four plus six is ten, because this isn't Sneak Attack or anything.
Matt: No.
Liam: That's ten plus a poison for a DC of 15?
Matt: Okay. It makes its saving throw. Rolled a 17.
Liam: So that was that, and then the third attack I'll go back to the keen dagger. 14.
Matt: 14. The second one strikes through, the poison tries to pulse through but once again it resists the impact; the third dagger comes down and before it even gets halfway towards, there's a blast of psychic energy from the inside of the containment unit that holds the Elder Brain that (boof) forces your hand back, the attack deflected entirely. That ends your turn. The other three illithids now go.
Ashley: I wish we had inspiration.
Orion: Isn't there a rope still hanging from there? Throw the damn rope!
Laura: You can climb it.
Liam: Yeah, I can probably get up 15 feet and hang there.
Travis: Yeah, I'm getting a massage right now.
Matt: This one's also going to turn around, reach forward, and its tentacles are going to attempt to wrap around Pike's head--
Travis: Don't you touch my friend.
Matt: That's going to be a 20?
Travis: A natural 20?
Matt: No, it's just 20. So Pike, you go ahead and take-- this'll be 15 points of psychic damage.
Liam: It was a good run, folks.
Marisha: What happened?
Laura: He rolled a 20.
Ashley: So he rolled a 20.
Matt: I rolled a total of 20. And you're stunned currently, so you take 15 points of psychic damage as you feel-- as you're trying to resist yourself, these cold tentacles wrap across the front of your field of vision, and you can feel this weird, toothy, pointy, biting sensation beginning to push towards the back of your skull. This one--
Ashley: That's it, that's all she wrote.
Matt: This one here is going to--
Laura: He's going to try to eat her brain!
Matt: Tiberius, that is a 15 versus AC.
Orion: Nope!
Matt: What's your AC?
Orion: 17, man!
Matt: 17, as you're rushing toward the magic carpet that just took off, yeah, you look over and the tentacles swing toward you, you duck just underneath and manage to avoid the attack. Now the two intellect devourers. One's going to go ahead and look up towards the magic carpet that's taking off and-- here we go. Oh, within ten feet? No, you're too far away. So instead it's going to go for you on top of the Elder Brain. I want you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw, Vax.
Liam: 20, natural 20.
Matt: Natural 20!
Sam: Needed that.
Laura: That's not to Matt, that's to the little brains.
Liam: The brains, the brains.
Marisha: Fuck you, little brains.
Matt: So you feel a similar blast of screaming energy, like you feel from the illithids, but it's more primal and more guttural. You manage to shrug it off in your mind and angrily look down at this weird, fleshy creature. The other one moves up and attempts to blast you again from the opposite side. Make another intelligence saving throw.
Liam: 19.
Matt: 19! Once again you feel from the back of your brain this like stunning impact and you shrug it off looking over this way.
Liam: (jeering) I'm smart! (laughter)
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: I'm grappled and stunned.
Matt: Yeah, so go ahead and make your saving throw.
Travis: Come on, buddy. (cheering)
Orion: Boom!
Matt: You shrug off the stunned effect, you're currently grappled by the entity.
Laura: You're so smart!
Ashley: You're so smart!
Marisha: You're so smart!
Travis: Cardiac kid, come on now, here we go. Table's getting hot.
Liam: Aren't you inspired?
Matt: And then also make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: Oh, Jesus. Because he's also got the things on me.
Liam: Just say 20.
Sam: Seven. (laughs) Plus two.
Liam: Big nine.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I said big nine.
Ashley: He rolled a 20, so that's gotta mean something.
Taliesin: I think a nine is a big six.
Marisha: The 20 carries over one, right? (laughter)
Travis: Residual?
Marisha: You take the one and you carry it over.
Travis: Natural 20 residual.
Liam: I personally can't wait until we roll new characters next show.
Laura: No.
Marisha: Shut up!
Matt: Unfortunately, you're still stunned.
Sam: Still stunned? Oh, so I got off--
Matt: You resisted the mind effect, but the tentacles on your head are now locking your brain in place, and your eyes are kind of rolling back in your head as you feel the illithid's mouth begin to push against the outside of your head. Grog?
Travis: I've got to break my grapple, right?
Matt: Yeah. Just go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Travis: One.
Matt: A natural one?
Sam: This guy.
Matt: A natural one; it rolled a four!
Orion: Plus your strength! Oh, it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: It doesn't matter.
Matt: Okay. So it's still holding you in place; you have your axe you picked up off the ground with your chain of returning; you can't physically move from your position as it's holding you there.
Travis: The axe is across the room, remember?
Matt: Well, no, you threw it over here and retrieved it at the end of the battle.
Travis: Well that's a good, that's a good plus.
Ashley: (frustrated noise)
Marisha: The fuck!
Matt: So what do you want to do?
Laura: You could attack with your chain.
Travis: I can attack with the chain?
Matt: You have your axe with your chain of returning, you just can't move, but you can still throw if you want to.
Orion: Oh, awesome.
Marisha: Can you chop the dude's arms off?
Travis: I have no-- it's holding me, I don't think I can be like--
Ashley: Maybe the guy that has him, his tentacles or whatever?
Travis: I was going to try and save you.
Ashley: Well. That's far.
Travis: Can I reach the illithid-- it's far?
Matt: Well, you can throw to either of them right now. They're both bent over gnome heads, they're bigger--
Travis: Where's Scanlan?
Ashley: Why the gnomes?
Matt: He's here, and that's Pike.
Ashley: Why the gnome hate?
Marisha: It's rare. It's a rare delicacy.
Matt: You guys were right there.
Travis: All right, I can't-- I'm going to try and throw it at the illithid that's on Scanlan.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Ashley: Tasty gnome.
Liam: All the fans who implied that Matt went light on us the last game--
Travis: 22?
Matt: 22, definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Okay, it's just one, two, three. Shit balls. 14.
Matt: 14 points of damage, all right. That one, you throw the axe, it slams into the shoulder of the illithid that's grabbing on to him. You see it look up at you angrily and a large portion of its chest is now gashed open and blood is pouring from the wound, but it's still holding tight right now. I think that's going to end your turn.
Travis: No, I'm done.
Matt: Do you want to pull your axe back?
Travis: Yes, I would like to.
Matt: Go ahead and you (grunts). Go ahead and make your check.
Travis: What do I, what the fuck do I roll, to the thing. What do I roll? A 12?
Matt: Yeah. A 20, you have to roll a d20, that was a d12.
Travis: Okay, good. (laughter)
Travis: 18.
Matt: So you pull on the chain of returning and it yanks the axes out of the wound and you catch it in midair, preparing for the next round.
Travis: (laughs) The 12 was a one. (laughter)
Matt: All right, first round of combat over. Let's roll better, guys. This is looking really dire. Vex, you're up.
Ashley: Get it.
Sam: Save everyone.
Matt: You're up at the top, you have a clear view of everyone.
Marisha: That's true, you're the only one with a bird's-eye view.
Sam: Just run. Save yourself.
Matt: As it is, these two illithids look kind of hurt, these two look really rough, this one looks really rough, both of these guys haven't been damaged yet but they have low hit points.
Sam: Save yourself, start a new race of people.
Laura: I am going to attack--
Sam: Hunter's Mark!
Laura: I'm going to put Hunter's Mark on-- oh, my brother just died.
Liam: I fainted.
Laura: On the one attacking Scanlan.
Taliesin: Not on Scanlan, on the one attacking Scanlan.
Matt: Oh right, sorry. (laughter)
Travis: What did he do?
Matt: In the confusion--
Sam: (shrieking) Help!
Orion: Friendly fire!
Ashley: That was amazing.
Laura: 14?
Matt: 14 unfortunately does--
Ashley: Plus! Plus War God's Blessing?
Matt: You're stunned.
Ashley: But can't I just do it just because?
Matt: No, unfortunately.
Marisha: Once, just this once, please?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Laura: But he's bent over and I've got a bird's-eye view of him.
Matt: You know what? He is grappling and he is right in the way, I'll go ahead and give you advantage on that attack. Roll again.
Laura: Yes! So I just roll again?
Matt: Roll again. Take whatever it is.
Laura: 22!
Matt: 22 will hit, okay. Because it is a stationary position, completely engulfing, and you have such a great view from above.
Laura: Right? 11 points of damage?
Matt: Okay. Did you roll your Hunter's Mark damage?
Laura: No, I did not.
Matt: Don't forget Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I won't, though. Three extra. That's for Hunter's Mark.
Ashley: 14 total?
Matt: Okay, gotcha. That's your first strike.
Laura: Okay. On my second one, should I just try to attack him again, kill him? All right, I'm going to kill him, try to hit him again. 18?
Matt: 18. Okay! So both strikes (whoosh). Go ahead and roll for damage.
Laura: 16 plus-- 19.
Matt: 19, okay. Both arrows (zoomf, zoomf), one embeds itself in the wound that Grog had left with the axe and you see the body tenses. Clarota stares up at you with this beaming angry look on his face; you realize, oh shit, Clarota's the one that's going after Scanlan. Your second arrow you bring down and release and it pierces the side of its face, gashing through and embedding itself in the chest. You can see now Clarota's looking really rough, but he's still holding taut. This horrible thought goes into your mind suddenly, a familiar voice saying, "You've all done your work. Now it's time to feast!"
Sam: (gasps) He turned on us!
Laura: I knew he was going to do that!
Sam: What? None of us knew that!
Laura: I totally knew he was going to do that.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn; Keyleth, you're up.
Travis: I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. (laughter)
Ashley: Every week.
Travis: Every week!
Sam: You know who would help us right now?
Laura: Kima would help us, but she's stone.
Sam: Can we make her not stone?
Ashley: We can make her not stone, except we didn't get a chance to.
Liam: If we live, we're in store for so much I-told-you-so. (laughter)
Liam: It's a big if.
Sam: Maybe we should leave her. I don't want to deal with that.
Travis: Who's up?
Marisha: I can make, I'm going to-- aw, crap. I'm going to phase down, and I'm going to pop up, and I'm going to break the well that's holding the Elder Brain.
Ashley: Get it!
Matt: Okay, so you're going to pop up here? Over here?
Liam: No, not there!
Matt: Right there?
Marisha: Not where I might hurt Vax.
Sam: Well, that's anywhere.
Laura: Just do the other side!
Marisha: You might have to do, like, a flippy-poo off it.
Matt: So what are you doing on the well, you're just grabbing it?
Marisha: Can I? Can I flip?
Matt: No, it's embedded in the ground. What are you doing?
Marisha: Oh, okay, so I want to take and I want to just punch to crack a big side of it to help spill out the brains.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a slam attack on the side
Marisha: Bust the side of it open.
Ashley: And then we'll stomp on him and make brain juice.
Marisha: I mean, it's an item, it's a stationary rock, so what do I add? Oh wait, I add-- so plus-- sorry, I'm not used to this. Plus eight, 16?
Matt: 16? You slam into the side of this; you're not attacking the brain, you're attacking the stonework. You can feel there is some psychic resistance, but because you're not attacking the brain directly, your fist slams into it, making purchase in the stone. Go ahead and roll damage against the stone.
Travis: Come on!
Matt: Double damage on this.
Ashley: Big damage!
Marisha: 20 damage.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: 20 damage. The side of the stonework crumples inward. Pieces of the stonework itself seem to be jutting in toward the Elder Brain, but it's stopped by some sort of psychic resistance, but the whole side here to here is now just open entirely, and you can see now the hole, the mass of-- there's probably hundreds of various illithid brains that have slowly congealed into one large brain structure as now you can see the underneath area. The liquid it kind of sits in is now pouring out, down the side of the structure.
Marisha: Hope they have flood insurance. (groans and laughter)
Travis: That was the worst Schwarzenegger action line ever. (Terminator voice) Hope they have flood insurance, ja.
Marisha: The Geico slayer!
Travis: Holy shit. That was amazing.
Marisha: Flo just got real, all right? Flo just got real.
Taliesin: That's no better, actually.
Marisha: From Progressive Flo? All the flow of the-- you know what, never mind.
Matt: So you only have the one slam attack? Earth elemental doesn't multi-attack?
Marisha: Yes, just the one. My slam attack is--
Matt: Right. Cool.
Marisha: Oh no, wait! I have multi-- earth elemental makes two slam attacks!
Matt: That's good to know. Go ahead and make another one.
Marisha: I could have done that last time?
Matt: Are you attacking the stonework still?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm just going to take the other chunk and punch it.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say you used some of your movement to move this way. By the way, guys, you can break up your movement. You can move, attack, then move if you want to.
Marisha: You can?
Matt: Yeah!
Travis: Unless Tickle-me-Elmo is holding you by the cage.
Marisha: It's cocked. 16 plus eight, so 22.
Matt: That'll definitely do it; go ahead. Is that total damage? Oh, that's the attack. Okay, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Ugh, four plus-- 18 damage.
Matt: 18's fine. So you break out the second half and now the entire side of it is open. All the fluid just spilled out the side and you get the sensation this is very frowned upon. (laughter)
Matt: That ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up!
Travis: A tentacle frown.
Orion: So I rush up, and Percy takes off?
Matt: As a note too, just so you guys are aware--
Taliesin: I didn't know you were coming to the carpet, sorry.
Laura: Oh no, we never closed the other door!
Matt: You start seeing a series of other entities slowly making their way up from the downstairs tunnel area.
Sam: I think we can beat them all.
Orion: Seeing what's going on-- there's an illithid right behind me, right?
Matt: There is. Right behind you, yeah.
Travis: I thought she closed the door.
Laura: No, we didn't.
Matt: Yeah, the other door is open.
Marisha: I closed the one, but then he said that they could levitate so I decided it wasn't worth it.
Sam: Hey, man. Grog's being held prisoner by an 80-pound dude.
Orion: So I'm running off and then Percy takes off? So I can't get to him?
Matt: Yeah, he's (whoosh), you can't get to him.
Orion: Awesome.
Travis: I'm so ashamed right now.
Orion: I need a technical question. Can I move the Horn and let go of the spell so I can then do my turn? Or does that take a thing to do that? Like, I want to let it go--
Matt: No.
Orion: Good. So as I'm running up to the carpet, I see Percy go and I'm like, "(growls) Damn Tiamat-lover!" So I bring over the Horn and right at the tip, on the carpet, I let it go. "You deal with it then!"
Matt: Percy? (loud clatter)
Laura: Oh no, K'Varn!
Matt: That's what you get!
Orion: I don't give it to Percy, I let it land on the carpet.
Matt: I know. I'm saying it's on his carpet right now, staring at him from the side.
Ashley: Put it on, Percy!
Orion: I see the-- oh god. Okay, I can only do this once. I see the-- they're not inside yet, right?
Matt: No. They're just starting to get to the doorway. You can see them right there.
Orion: Awesome. Okay, that is a-- and this is a-- Okay.
Matt: What you got, Tiberius? (laughter)
Travis: (Tiberius voice) Poppycock, poppycock.
Orion: Right. I have-- I blow everything. I'm going to blow everything.
Travis: Yes! Blow everybody. (laughter)
Matt: How diplomatic of you!
Sam: I'm stunned!
Orion: You cannot resist!
Matt: So, Tiberius.
Orion: As I leave the Horn there, I turn to where the door is. Obelisk of Stone. I seal up the entryway.
Matt: How many with that, what level are you using it?
Orion: Well, how wide is it? Like 15 feet?
Matt: It's a little over five feet wide.
Orion: Great. I only need one, right?
Matt: Technically, yeah.
Orion: Okay. So I seal that one-- I'm going to use all three right now.
Marisha: Seal the other one, too. I only partially sealed it.
Orion: I'll seal the other one.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: And I'll use the other one on myself.
Matt: Okay!
Orion: And I'm going to use-- I only have three left. Yeah, okay. And I'm going to use my last three sorcerer points that I have, and I have zero points after this, and I'm going to cast Blur on myself. And that's my turn.
Matt: All righty. You now start hearing (boof, boof) slamming sounds from the other side of the stone walls. Both sides of the walls are now sealed off with pillars, and a large pile of rubble on that side. All right, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, before I go anywhere, I'm taking a shot at Clarota.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Betraying bastard.
Taliesin: With Sharpshooter, that's 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 19 points?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That hits, and let's do my damage. That's 22 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. So, Scanlan, as you're stunned, you feel the tentacles swirling around the back of your head. Teeth are grinding into the back of your skull, and you feel this horrible pain as all of a sudden, Clarota's mouth is beginning to find a way towards your skull. (laughter)
Matt: And then the tentacles suddenly go limp as the back of Clarota's head (gunshot) becomes a mess.
Taliesin: Traitor!
Marisha: Traitor!
Laura: I can't believe we killed Clarota!
Taliesin: Some people have no sense of fucking honor! (laughter)
Marisha: Traitor!
Travis: Oh, Percy!
Matt: In a split second, your longtime ally, now turncoat, is scattered across the stone floor. You're released, you're no longer stunned.
Sam: (gasps) Hi, guys!
Taliesin: I still have another shot.
Matt: You do.
Marisha: There's someone on Pike, right?
Matt: There's still one on Pike right now, yeah, right here.
Taliesin: I'm taking a shot there.
Travis: Come on, Perce!
Ashley: Perce!
Marisha: Pew pew!
Taliesin: Oh yeah! So that's 17-- 17, 18, 19--
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Okay, that just hits, all right. I'm trying to use Sharpshooter, so it changes everything. And that's 18 points of damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And did we get a short rest before this fight happened?
Sam: No.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Fuck, never mind.
Matt: No you did not.
Marisha: That's why we're all burnt out on spells.
Taliesin: That's why we're all burnt out on shit, okay.
Orion: Except me.
Matt: Yeah, the other one--
Taliesin: I'm going to go up further.
Matt: Even further? Okay.
Laura: "Because I didn't help you guys!" Thanks, Tiberius!
Ashley: "I abandoned my troop!"
Orion: It's going to come in handy now!
Taliesin: Am I high enough yet for her to jump down onto the--
Matt: Yeah, you could probably pull it off.
Taliesin: So, if you and your bear want to jump on?
Matt: It'd be an acrobatics roll, but yeah.
Sam: Wait, why would you-- you've got to come save us!
Laura: Yeah, no, go down and save them, honestly, because I'm staying up top for right now, unless we can teleport out.
Taliesin: Oh, in that case, instead of going up I'm going to go fly to the right, then.
Orion: Pick up Vax!
Laura: Why?
Orion: I said Vax.
Laura: Vax?
Marisha: Vax? Pick up Vax?
Orion: Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah, so I'm going to fly down towards Vax, as well.
Matt: Okay. So you're going down to here instead?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you can get about-- we'll say, if you're just going--
Taliesin: Yeah, go there.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Hi.
Ashley: Hey you guys!
Taliesin: Hey you guys!
Marisha: Hey you guys!
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn. That brings it--
Ashley: Did anything happen to the guy that had me--
Matt: He just took damage, but he's not done yet.
Ashley: He just took damage, he's still (slurps).
Matt: So, Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: It's my turn.
Matt: Go ahead and roll to get rid of the Mind Blast stun.
Ashley: Come on.
Sam: Come on, Pikey.
Ashley: Fuck. It's seven.
Matt: Seven? Nope. You're still locked in place.
Taliesin: Can you heal yourself?
Matt: She cannot move. Her entire brain is locked in with a searing clenching pain, psychic energy is just clutching her brain and holding it hostage.
Sam: Still beautiful, though. (laughter)
Matt: You feel, once again, the teeth beginning to pierce the back of the flesh. You feel the teeth of the mind flayer beginning to scrape against the skull, the actual bone it's found in the back. Vax, you're up.
Liam: What did Clarota do with his hat?
Matt: Oh, it's somewhere on the ground over here.
Liam: Over behind--
Matt: Over behind this.
Liam: Okay, I'm still Hasted, I'm going to run down the center over Clar-- I'm going to step on Clarota's-- I don't know if he has nuts, but whatever's there, I'm going to step there, run around Scanlan, and place his fucking hat on my head.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And then run up behind that third mind flayer, who I don't think has taken a hit yet, and just start stabbing him in the back.
Matt: Right here?
Laura: No, on Pike!
Liam: I can't get back there.
Laura: You can't?
Liam: I don't think so.
Laura: Would he be able to make it?
Liam: Well it's up to-- oh dear.
Matt: You can't, with the speed you're running there, because your Hasted speed is doubled, so it's 60 feet.
Liam: I'm Hasted, I can run 12 spaces, so if you think that I could have run around the mind flayer, put on the party hat--
Matt: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. You can move right there.
Liam: Okay, great. So I'm going to start stabbing him in the back, angrily.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Okay, yeah, so, first one is a 15?
Matt: Unfortunately-- no, that does just hit.
Liam: That's a Sneak Attack, because she's next to him. There's nothing in the rule book about stunned, or unconscious, or anything.
Matt: How Sneak Attack works is if they're next to someone that's aggressive toward them; they feel like they have people on two fronts, which is why you get the benefit.
Taliesin: He is, to be fair, very occupied.
Matt: I will say, circumstantially though, because he is currently grappled on to Pike, and is in the process of trying to grind into her brain with his mouth, he is a little preoccupied at the moment.
Travis: He's sucking head.
Matt: So I'm going to go ahead and make a perception roll versus your fast movement. Go ahead and make a stealth-- roll stealth to see whether or not he takes notice and changes his position in defense.
Liam: I rolled a 24.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead. The first attack you rolled was a 15, that hits!
Liam: Okay, thank you.
Matt: And that is a Sneak Attack, he did not see you coming that quickly.
Liam: All right, so that is four, plus seven is 11, plus-- okay, that's 17, 21, thank you. 26, 30, 33. 33 with keen dagger.
Matt: 33 with the keen dagger?
Liam: And I'm sticking that in the back of his neck.
Matt: Okay. That was your first attack?
Liam: That's the first attack.
Matt: Okay, so the first dagger (shnk) sinks into the back of the neck. You just manage to miss all the seriously vital stuff, but you carve a giant section out of the side of its head. The rest of its leathery black outfit's now slick with its own blood. You see it angrily growls, almost this weird guttural, this (gurgling growl) sound as it still remains taut and clenched on Pike, its eyes glaring at you, basically telling you, "Look what I'm about to do to your friend."
Liam: Okay, so good thing I have more knives. So I take the other one, flip it in my hand and then stick it into the neck afterwards. That's a 24.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Yeah, it does. That's eight. Fire damage, I don't know if he takes any fire damage, and I'm going to then stick him with my poison dagger, which isn't going to poison him. But that is a 26 which hits as well.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: And that is eight.
Matt: Eight points of damage. So the first one you stab in the side of the head, you pull back and toss it in the air, catch the second one. As it bursts into flames you place the searing dagger down into the center of its back between its shoulder blades. Its back tenses, and as it does it reaches back and tries to grab for the dagger as you pull back the third one. As it looks back at you it brings up one arm to stop you as it goes in to directly go after Pike's head. The third dagger you then stab it right in the front of the skull. Its eyes roll back in its head and its tentacles limply drag off. (cheering)
Liam: As a bonus action, I would like to Goodfellas-kick him about eight times in the ribs. (laughter)
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: I'll allow it. Oh my god. Because that guy was next! If we didn't kill him this turn, she would've taken 55 points of damage.
Travis: 50-- Let's not even say the number.
Ashley: You saved my life.
Matt: Yeah. And if it takes you to zero hit points, they extract the brain and eat it.
Laura: Now we've got to squish those little brains.
Liam: There's still a mind flayer.
Travis: We're coming real close.
Matt: Let's see if they get their Mind Blast back. Nope. Nope.
Liam: This show is not good for my blood pressure.
Marisha: I know! It's like constant fight or flight.
Travis: I think I'm going blind in my left eye.
Marisha: This should fix your sleep schedule though, right?
Travis: Yeah, totally.
Matt: Seeing both of them get immediately slaughtered, both of these illithids just Plane Shift. A defensive standpoint, self-preservation is kicking in. However, intellect devourers do not have self-preservation. They're there for a specific reason. So this one here is going to move over to this side and is going to attempt to make a Devour Intellect attack against Keyleth. Keyleth, go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Marisha: I'm an elemental, so.
Matt: You keep your intelligence score as you.
Marisha: Oh, I do?
Matt: The physical attributes you get from the elemental form. You keep your intellect, wisdom, and charisma.
Marisha: Okay, then 18.
Matt: 18, Okay. You resist the blast of mental impact from the intellect devourer, now on the ground with its four feral legs, its brain form rippling. The second one is going to turn over here and saw the two shots, the one that took out Clarota. It turns up towards Percy, as you've lowered on the magic carpet, Percy. Go ahead and make an intellect saving throw.
Taliesin: Eight.
Matt: Eight? All righty.
Sam: Oh boy. That ain't no good.
Matt: You take 11 points of psychic damage.
Taliesin: There's an "and" there, isn't there?
Sam: And it's undone immediately. (laughter)
Matt: And you take eight points of intellect damage.
Laura: Oh, this is what happened to Grog!
Travis: You're better off than six, right?
Taliesin: Eight points of intellect damage. What does that mean, precisely?
Liam: Minus from your intelligence.
Sam: You would know if you had more intellect.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: No, no, no, no. For this, it basically-- what's your intelligence?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16? Yeah, the blast hits you and you just shrug off the impact. It has to exceed your intelligence.
Taliesin: So do I still take eight more points of damage, though?
Matt: No, no no. You just the additional--
Taliesin: I just, I'm just going to go duh-duh. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, the intellect damage is not permanent.
Taliesin: I like purple.
Matt: Not quite that bad.
Travis: I can't not do it.
Matt: All right. That ends their turn. That brings us to Scanlan. You're no longer stunned. You now have full capacity of yourself and you're looking around, oh shit.
Sam: Do we get out of here or do we try to kill these things?
Travis: Can you get us out of here?
Sam: I can get some of us out of here.
Marisha: Start getting us out.
Sam: Are we getting out or are we fighting?
Travis: Getting us out.
Marisha: Because we still have these fuckers we have to--
Ashley: Because Tiberius can get some of us out, right?
Liam: It's just the brains. Just the little brains.
Sam: It's just the little brains. For now.
Matt: Make a perception check, by the way.
Marisha: For now, but people can beat through those doors. That's not a permanent thing.
Taliesin: We need 60 seconds to get out of here is what we need. We need 60 uninterrupted seconds.
Marisha: Well, we can start gathering our shit and packing up.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Marisha: We can start packing up.
Sam: Am I leaving or am I staying?
Travis: You do what you want.
Liam: Do what you want. It's chaos.
Sam: (sighs) All right. Then I'll attack.
Matt: Swarming thing that drift up the sides of the temple from the floor. Coming from inside the temple and out toward the top.
Laura: We should probably get out of here! They're coming up the sides!
Ashley: We can't get you out of here if you don't come--
Sam: I run up to Pike. I grab her hand. I say, "I want to have babies with you." (laughter)
Sam: Let's get out of here. (sings) So now I come to you with Dimension Door.
Ashley: Wait! Can I do a Mass Cure Wounds before we leave? (laughter)
Sam: And we get out.
Matt: You're still stunned from the Mind Blast. You haven't made your save.
Sam: We're going up to the top of the-- to the thing. Just to the roof there.
Laura: They're coming up the sides!
Ashley: We've got to go somewhere else.
Sam: Well, I didn't know that. (laughs) It's done.
Orion: It's fine. It's good that they're up there.
Sam: And, as a bonus, I'm going to send some inspiration to Grog.
Matt: Okay, as you Dimension Door you just go ahead and look back. Using the song of love you gave to Pike, you give back, give a wink to Grog. Grog, you take a 1d10 inspiration. 1d10 inspiration dice to you.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Grog, we would like you to rage.
Travis: I'm already there. I'm just being fucking grappled. Is it my turn?
Matt: It is now.
Travis: Oh, can I try it for the third time to break free?
Matt: You can. Go ahead and go ahead and make your athletics.
Liam: Use that inspiration die, man.
Travis: I'll use the inspiration die just in case I rolled balls again.
Matt: Well, you can use it after you do it. See what you roll and then add it.
Travis: It's athletics, right?
Matt: Athletics, yeah.
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18?
Liam: Come on.
Matt: Yeah, you (boosh) break out of the creature's grasp. Suddenly it's reaching at you from behind the bars. You can see there's this slick, brackish oil on your body from where it was holding you. Fleshless arms clutching you to the bars.
Travis: So is everybody leaving? Should I climb up the rope?
Matt: There is Lady Kima who is turned to stone.
Marisha: We've got to get Kima out.
Travis: Fuck Lady Kima!
Orion: Pick her up!
Laura: I thought you had a crush on her?
Ashley: Can he grab her and climb?
Matt: You can. She's not a big stone structure.
Travis: Okay, cool. I pick her up and start trying to climb up the rope.
Matt: Okay, so you rush, you grab the stone form.
Sam: Put her in the Bag of Holding!
All - sam - matt: No!
Travis: She's stone! It doesn't matter!
Orion: Don't do that!
Travis: I take her and-- oh, fine. I'll hold on to her.
Sam: No, put her in the bag!
Marisha: Can you make one of those baby slings? Stuff her in your belt?
Taliesin: It's not time for arts and crafts.
Matt: You run up. You grab Lady Kima. You grab her in your arms and you rush. The rope is currently dangling from this side where you guys first came in.
Laura: Stomp all over the brain to get to it.
Matt: 50 speed. You can get up to here. You can just get up to the rope and we'll say as your dash action you can begin to climb, if you'd like.
Travis: I would like to climb.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I would like to raise.
Travis: I would like to rage. Rage climb.
Matt: It gets you about there. Rage climbing like (grunts).
Orion: Yes!
Matt: One-handed up the rope. That's pretty intense. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Marisha: Yes. That Crossfit training come in handy.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. Yeah, it's sore. You know that arm is going to be dead tomorrow, but right now it doesn't even matter. You're just clutching Lady Kima, still locked in her attack pose, in one arm as you're overhand grabbing the rope and getting yourself up as fast as you can.
Travis: You better remember this when you wake up. (laughter)
Matt: Rage-climbing up the rope.
Liam: He's climbing the Cliffs of Insanity! (laughter)
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: I should just stay where I am, right guys?
Taliesin: And you should shoot things.
Laura: I'm going to do that, yes. Is there any other-- there's just a little brain in there right now?
Matt: Right now there's two brains, and you can see just in the outskirts of the temple's side here, two more illithid that are making their way up the side of the temple.
Laura: Oh, fuck me.
Matt: With about a hundred or so just now gathering towards the bottom of the temple base.
Laura: Jesus. We're going to get out of here real fast! You guys are listening to me, right? Because things are coming up the side and we need to get out of here.
Sam: But what if there's gold down there to find?
Laura: I don't give a fuck! I'm going to Hunter's Mark a little brain. Or should I keep attacking the Elder Brain? What do you guys think?
Taliesin: Elder Brain is spilling out the side now, isn't it?
Matt: The Elder Brain is still inside, just the stonework on the outside of it is currently knocked out.
Taliesin: Yeah, I have a carpet anyway, so let's just jump on it.
Liam: I mean, it might get sent reeling, that brain.
Laura: I know, that's why I'm kind of like, hm.
Liam: Maybe if-- we should try to get out of here, but maybe if we can frigging hurt that brain it'll stun them or send them reeling or something, or make them mad.
Laura: All right. I can do Hail of Thorns on it again, so I'll Hunter's Mark it and then I'll do Hail of Thorns on it.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 27.
Matt: That'll hit. Releasing again, in midair you can see all the thorns appear out the sides of the arrow shaft. It explodes into a giant conical-- just a ray, almost like a blizzard of thorns.
Liam: Get it.
Laura: I don't add-- do I add Hunter's Mark to that damage, or just my regular and then that?
Matt: At the end of all the damage you dealt with the attack, you then add Hunter's Mark to that.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Big money.
Laura: 22. 24.
Matt: 24, all righty. Keyleth, go ahead and make a reflex saving throw.
Marisha: What's happening?
Laura: Oh, right, because you're right next to it, sorry Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, it's okay. My reflex-- I use my dex modifier for my elemental, correct?
Matt: Or deflect, yeah, sorry, old carryover, it's dexterity.
Marisha: Ten.
Matt: Ten? Versus your spell save of--
Laura: 14.
Matt: Yeah, so you take the same damage. You take 24 points of damage.
Laura: Sorry. Oh right, you're really, really strong.
Marisha: Yeah, I've got 100 hit points still.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: So how many points? 21?
Matt: 24. So, all the thorns explode against your rocky physical form; you just shrug it off, like it's nothing. (laughs) It tickles a little.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm good.
Laura: So I'll try to-- I guess I'll just attack it again, because I've got nowhere else to go.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: 17?
Matt: All right, 17-- actually no, 17 will miss.
Laura: Oh really, with it oozing out and everything?
Matt: The second, there's some sort of psychic protective field in the brain. As you fire down, the arrow looks like it should strike and then it just arcs off to the side nonsensically, and then just splinters against the stonework next to the--
Laura: Fudge!
Travis: Fudge.
Matt: You going to stay where you are? You going to move?
Orion: Get on Trinket!
Laura: I'm going to climb onto Trinket for some reason, because that makes sense.
Matt: Okay, you climb onto Trinket's back. That brings us to Keyleth. You're up.
Marisha: Okay, what's the situation with the brain soup?
Matt: The liquid is poured out.
Marisha: And how are the brains? Are just brains just floating downstream?
Matt: No, it's actually all-- at a long distance, it looks like one giant brain, close up it looks like all of these smaller brains have all congealed into one giant mind.
Laura: It's like a jello mold of brains.
Marisha: Like a jello mold of a brain. And there's fluid coming out from underneath of it?
Matt: Yeah. Literally the fluid it was sitting in, it was mostly submerged in, is all now poured out onto the ground near you, beginning to get slick.
Marisha: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be like, phase under, phase down, and I'm going to get under where the brain would be, and I'm going to Superman punch it!
Laura: Yes!
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: From underneath.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an attack roll.
Travis: Come on, punch it in its big brain anus.
Marisha: 23!
Matt: 23, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: (laughs) 11? Wait, is that my--
Taliesin: No, 22.
Marisha: Oh, 22! You're right, 22.
Matt: It's not double damage, because you're not hitting the structure. So 11 points of damage? All right, now I want you to go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: Okay, that sounds fun.
Matt: So just roll and add your strength modifier of the earth elemental.
Marisha: 14?
Matt: Okay, as you punch upward, you're still partially absorbed into the earth, but your fist comes through and it slams in, and you feel this sickening thud sound as your fist hits the interior of the brain. It still moves a little bit but it stays in its place held aloft by its own psychic defense mechanism. Make your second attack.
Marisha: Okay, yeah, same, 21.
Matt: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that one.
Laura: Big damage!
Marisha: Come on.
Taliesin: Big money.
Marisha: Oh, that's better. 16.
Matt: 16 damage. Go ahead and roll another strength check.
Marisha: Eight.
Matt: Eight? Okay. Once again, you slam your fist into it and you feel like the impact is absorbed partially by the psychic field around the brain. It holds itself in place. It's still not moving from within that small--
Marisha: Do I stay or do I get out?
Laura: Get out.
Orion: Get out.
Matt: You still have about-- I'd say it only took you about 15 feet of movement to get underneath it.
Marisha: In my burrowing speed, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: So, I'm going to start burrowing up the side of the mountain-- up the side of the temple, so I can pop out next to them.
Matt: Okay, so we'll say 25, 30, 35, 40, 45. What's your total burrow speed?
Marisha: 60.
Matt: So you'll be about there.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So you're about as high as Tiberius is, partially up the wall.
Marisha: I'm in the wall.
Laura: They won't see you.
Travis: Vax, you're still on the floor, right?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Up on there. As you glance in, you kinda have a brief look at the outside of the wall and on the opposite side there are two other mind flayers. One more coming up on the side and another troll behind it. And the troll's slamming onto the bricks you left up. And these two illithids are starting to look up and see you moving up, and their eyes go up and they can see the opening in the top of the-- where the wall collapsed earlier. And they both look up and kinda start drifting up towards it. So that ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: What's the order after me?
Matt: Well, it's Percy, Pike, Vax, and then they go. Then Scanlan, Grog.
Taliesin: I was going to hold my turn to get everybody on the carpet.
Liam: I'm coming.
Orion: Okay, okay, good. I cast Fly at 5th level. I cast it on myself. I cast it on Grog. And I cast it on-- you're not there.
Laura: Trinket!
Orion: Trinket. (groans)
Travis: She's on Trinket.
Laura: So I can fly if I'm on Trinket, right?
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: Sweet!
Matt: All right, so Grog, Trinket, and--
Orion: Me.
Matt: Yourself. Okay.
Orion: And I (flying noise).
Matt: What's the fly speed on that?
Orion: Um, outside?
Liam: A skillion.
Orion: I dunno, it's right here. It's right here.
Matt: It's on the card, the cards I gave you.
Orion: The cards! Look at the cards. It's 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet. You make your way up top and you're now hovering. Trinket's now having another Peter Pan moment with you on his back awkwardly. It's just gotten used to flying on its own, that one time it had. Now it has an extra weight on its back. (bear noises)
Laura: You can do it, buddy. You can do it.
Ashley: You got it, Trink.
Matt: All right.
Orion: Oh wait, hold on-- I want to turn to to everybody and go, "Fly, you fools."
Matt: It's a free action, I'll let you do that. (laughs) Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm holding my turn.
Matt: You're holding back?
Taliesin: I'm holding my turn.
Matt: Okay. Percy, holding back. Pike, go ahead and make an intellect saving throw.
Laura: Yes!
Ashley: 19.
Matt: 19. You finally shrug off the effect of the Mind Blast. Your eyes clarify.
Sam: Does she fall in love with the first thing she sees? (laughter)
Matt: (laughs) The first thing you do see is Scanlan holding you. You're now outside of the temple. There's the dark, kind of dull glowing green atmosphere outside the entire Yug'Voril city around you, with bits of blue crystal, you know, against the cavern walls. It's scary. You look around you, you can see illithid charging up the side of the temple, just gliding toward you angrily. You look forward and on your shoulders, clutching you, is Scanlan, blood streaking down the front of his face with a big smile.
Ashley: (gasps) Scanlan, are you hurt?
Sam: I'm fine, baby. How are you?
Ashley: I'm great. Well, not really, but I'm just going to pretend I'm happy so that everybody can be okay. (laughter)
Orion: That's right, Pike. Bury it deep inside.
Ashley: Well, can I do a spell? Okay, Mass Cure Wounds.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: For the, well, hold on a minute. How low is everybody? Not really that low?
Laura: Nobody's really low.
Travis: I'm at 32.
Ashley: He's pretty low.
Taliesin: You two are the only ones.
Laura: Yeah. Can you cast something on Kima? Oh, no. We should just keep her stone for now.
Sam: You're low. You're super low.
Laura: Yeah, cast it on yourself, man.
Travis: Heal yourself.
Taliesin: She can hold this part of her turn until everybody's up there.
Matt: Mass Cure Wounds on yourself? Because Mass Cure Wounds is for multiple people.
Ashley: No, can I just do--
Matt: You can cast Cure Wounds on yourself.
Ashley: I can?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: But he needs it, too.
Matt: It's your choice. It's also touch. You have to be next to him to do that.
Ashley: Shit.
Travis: Just do your thing. You need it.
Ashley: All right, I need it? Oh no.
Matt: At six hit points, I'd recommend it to you.
Travis: The DM recommends it. (laughter)
Matt: You were so close to dying again. I was so scared.
Travis: I stringently urge you.
Liam: Four out of five DMs recommend. (laughter)
Ashley: All right, 17.
Matt: Okay, so you heal yourself 17 hit points. You clutch your holy symbol. You feel the warmth fill your body and your wounds seal up slowly. You feel a little better, because you were on death's door there. All right. You want to move at all? Anything else you want to do this turn or are you good?
Ashley: Now I'm at 23. Wait, so bonus action?
Orion: Get on the bear!
Laura: No, he can't--
Matt: You don't have to.
Ashley: He can "bear-ly" hold one. (groans and laughter)
Laura: Ba dum tss.
Ashley: I can't do that, right?
Matt: What?
Ashley: I can't get on Trinket?
Matt: Right now, Trinket can barely hold Vex.
Ashley: So as a bonus action, I'll give Scanlan a kiss on his cheek.
Sam: Oh! Do I get an inspiration for that?
Matt: You do. (laughter)
Matt: A d6 inspiration dice.
Sam: I'm never going to wash it again.
Orion: You never wash it to begin with.
Matt: It's this strangely romantic moment as she reaches forward, grabs him and kisses him on the cheek and pulls away and he looks at her with this beautiful smile, and then the sound effects kick in again, of the bats screeching ahead and the (inhales) of all the illithid swarming up the side of the temple.
Marisha: Oh god, we're still in a war zone!
Ashley: Oh no, we got to get it together.
Matt: All right, Vax.
Liam: Okay, I run up the dais, land on the brain. I'm on my way, but before I go, I'm going to kiss you goodbye. Dagger, dagger, dagger. Stabbing into the brain before I leap onto the carpet. So here I go. First one-- misses. Second one is a 25.
Matt: 25, okay.
Liam: Which gets nine damage.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And last dagger is a 13.
Matt: No.
Liam: Okay, so I'll give him a little cut, a little nick, and then jump on the flying carpet.
Matt: Jump on the flying carpet. All righty.
Liam: And I grab Percy around the neck and kiss him on the cheek, and say, "Let's get out of here, you bastard."
Taliesin: Do I get an inspiration point for that? (laughter)
Matt: No.
Laura: That's a double standard.
Taliesin: You know how I feel about you.
Liam: Fight the patriarchy.
Matt: Down the road, maybe. This is the start of something beautiful.
Taliesin: I'm feeling something new.
Matt: Let the seeds germinate for a while. Then the dice may come naturally. So you're holding your turn? Percy, you want to go now?
Taliesin: I want to go now.
Matt: All right. So, that brings you here. Percy, go ahead.
Taliesin: I'm just going to reel straight up. And on my way up, I'm going to take two more shots at the brain.
Matt: Okay, okay. We'll say here for the purposes of this. Taking two more shots?
Taliesin: 16.
Liam: Oh, I'm suffocating in the brain!
Matt: Oh no, it's fallen over. What's the first roll?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 does hit. Oh, it's not even flat, okay. We're just going to put it down there.
Taliesin: And 19.
Matt: 16 doesn't hit. The 19 just barely hits it. It pierces through the psychic barrier. (zoomf) The bullet sinking again into the fleshy membrane.
Taliesin: The second one has a bonus die, yay.
Matt: Ice shot.
Taliesin: Ice shot.
Marisha: Maybe you'll freeze it.
Liam: Percy and Vax, ship it!
Taliesin: That's 13 points plus two points of ice damage.
Matt: Okay, so 16 total. All right. As it blasts inside, you can see the ice, these strange crystals of frozen liquid, they burst out, almost like it actually freezes the blue explosion in place for a moment, and then the ice just slowly melts away. Yeah, there's some damage dealt to it, but this is a hardy sack of hit points. And it's coming online. So with the end of your turn, the brain, now taken a bunch of hits, begins to pulse with energy, now that it's been freed from its control and it's slowly brought itself out of this trance-like slumber that it was placed in by K'Varn. The Elder Brain is now becoming conscious once again.
Liam: Oh dear.
Taliesin: Can we go up there? Can you put us at our height now? (laughter)
Marisha: Can you represent us accurately?
Matt: So at a 30-foot radius, which you guys are, it gives off a pulse of energy, (boomf) this giant psychic burst of purple-ish, psychic blast just cascades out of the center and just fills the room for a second with this large dull thud-like "thoom" sound. All of you instinctively look down and see this explosion that just dissipates as it crests the bottom of the magic carpet, which is just out of range.
Taliesin: You're wearing the helmet, at least.
Matt: At which point, you guys who are at the top, looking off to the side, all the illithid that are rushing up the tunnel, there's a sudden flash of purple energy in their eyes simultaneously. Like now the Elder Brain has come back online and has reconnected with its people.
Laura: Out, out, out!
Matt: All right, that brings us to Grog. Grog.
Travis: I can keep flying up?
Matt: All of the sudden, the rope is really easy to go up. It's nothing, you're just going hand over hand.
Orion: You can fly, Grog!
Travis: I have one more level three, whatever it's called, level three healing potion. They're called called superior or something? What's the word for it?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I'd like to take that.
Marisha: I have so much adrenaline during these kind of fights.
Taliesin: I know.
Matt: They're moving around, they're angry, they can't quite get to their targets.
Travis: I heal 24 points of hit damage.
Matt: Fantastic. Rolling for the bottom of the attack round. Okay. The troll bursts through the door, filling in with the two mind flayers behind it. They both look up, frustrated. And both begin to drift up.
Laura: No!
Matt: As far as they can get.
Travis: Fuck this house of horrors.
Ashley: How do we get out of here?
Laura: How are we going to get out of here?
Matt: They are going to attempt two Mind Blasts. All right. That's as high as they get with levitation. With the full height that takes the top, because technically you guys are up here, I just couldn't put the structure that high up. The only people-- The only person that's in the radius would be Scanlan and Pike. Again.
Ashley: All right.
Matt: Both of you guys make intellect saving throws again.
Sam: I'm just looking into her eyes the whole time.
Ashley: Can you sing?
Marisha: You've got that inspiration die.
Sam: Oh, I do. I don't need it though.
Matt: What did you roll?
Sam: I'm at 20.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: 14.
Matt: 14? All right.
Sam: Can I sing for her?
Matt: (laughs) Unfortunately, you have to do that on your turn. You manage to resist the effects of it. You take 22 points of psychic damage and once again your brain clenches--
Laura: Good thing you healed yourself, Pike!
Matt: Damn good thing you healed yourself.
Sam: She was at 23! That's 22. That's one point!
Laura: Yeah. That's the second time this round.
Matt: You feel all of the sudden, the blast hits you and you see her eyes roll back in her head as she reaches up and grabs the side of her head again, nearly dropping her shield and mace, which you manage to catch before they clatter down into the temple.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: Baby, come on.
Ashley: Maybe we'll be okay?
Marisha: Do you want some more dice?
Matt: All right, Grog, you're up. Oh no, you're up there, they went. That brings it to the top of the round. Vex, you're up.
Marisha: Take it, take it. Give it to her, please.
Orion: Head to the beach!
Sam: Wait, top of the round?
Matt: Yeah, we're at the very top now. At the very end, the new guys burst in and attacked.
Laura: I'm going to-- (sighs) Is that brain fluid still floating around it? Like, out and stuff?
Travis: Well, we woke it up.
Laura: I know.
Liam: But now it's awake, so--
Matt: Percy shot-- No, actually, you didn't do your turn on that one. I'm sorry, I think we skipped Scanlan.
Sam: Should I kill the brain, or try to kill the brain?
Liam: If you can also flee at the same time.
Orion: Well, he has to wait for the carpet.
Sam: The brain is down there in the puddle? In the pool? Is that big scaffolding still hanging over it?
Matt: It's currently dangling over to this side. Because it's been busted from three different corners and it's precariously hanging.
Sam: But it's not right over the thing?
Laura: But it might fall and tip.
Sam: Or it could not.
Ashley: Could somebody also use Telekinesis to pull it to fall the other way?
Orion: I do not have the necessary item to do two concentration spells at once.
Sam: Is it super heavy?
Matt: It's pretty heavy. It probably weighs close to 700 to 1,000 pounds.
Marisha: What does?
Matt: The giant brass structure.
Sam: And how high above it is it? Like, would it get a significant amount of force?
Matt: It would fall down and then topple over.
Sam: Unless I made it fall--
Matt: Unless you made it fall. In that case, we'll see.
Sam: Do I do that or do I just Lightning Strike? Okay.
Liam: It's your decision.
Marisha: Go bold!
Travis: Do what you were going to do. Do it.
Sam: I'm feeling handsy. (laughter)
Sam: (sings) Bigby's Hand! So I take Bigby's Hand and I sort of try to wrench it off the last thing that's holding it up, but in the direction of the--
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Of the brain.
Matt: Go ahead and make a roll, adding your plus five for your casting ability.
Sam: Well, that's not good.
Orion: And inspiration!
Sam: Oh, yeah! Okay, so that makes it 13 plus what?
Matt: 13 plus five, which is your charisma.
Sam: Okay, then 18.
Matt: 18. As the spectral Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs the top of the structure, you can see the weird bit of bent metal that was once part of the mostly-destroyed structure that held it aloft in the center of the temple (metal creaking) wrenches forth and snaps as the entire structure begins to be pulled at an angle.
Sam: (sings) It's Bigby's Hand.
Matt: It slams down at an angle into the side of the brain and coming to rest on top, crushing even further the corpse of Clarota, currently smeared across the ground. Oh, man. Go ahead and roll 6d6 force damage on that. Crushing damage, as this heavy thing jams itself into the brain.
Liam: Six cubes, Sam, six cubes.
Sam: Orion's my dice bimbo.
Orion: Here you go, boss.
Ashley: There you go, boss!
Sam: 16.
Matt: 16, so the structure slams into the Elder Brain, and you can see like a bit of purplish black liquid kinda squirts out to one side and for the first time you can see a part of the brain is actually torn open, and the purplish glow that you see throbbing in the middle of its folds is now visible from the interior. You can see now, it's taken some real damage. Immediately the two mind flayers that were floating up look down, freaked out, and begin moving towards the brain now, instinctively, to defend it.
Sam: And bonus action, can I pour some superior healing potion down Pike's beautiful throat?
Matt: You can. (laughter)
Matt: I'm not going anywhere with that.
Taliesin: Yeah, no.
Sam: I'm just pouring my potion down Pike's throat.
Matt: Anyway. All right, so Vex, what're you doing?
Sam: I don't know what superior is.
Matt: Oh, it's a superior one, superior goes to, it's 8d4 plus eight.
Sam: Do I roll or does she?
Matt: You roll.
Sam: Oh!
Matt: It's your potion.
Sam: 8d4 plus eight.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Holy bajeez. One.
Matt: Five, nine, 13.
Sam: 15, 18, 21.
Matt: 15, 18, 21.
Matt: One more.
Sam: 22.
Matt: Plus eight, 30. You heal 30 hit points.
Ashley: What? Awesome.
Sam: I got some good potion.
Matt: Very, very expensive potion used. All right, so. Vex? You're on Trinket still, do you want to hold your action and wait for the rest of the carpet, do you want to attack anyone, what do you want to do?
Laura: I want to attack the Elder Brain.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Laura: I'm going to-- I think all I can do is a Conjure Barrage.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: So it's the cone of attack.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: So that will get hopefully all the things, because I'm shooting down, right?
Matt: Well, how big is the cone?
Laura: It's 60 feet.
Matt: 60-foot cone from your angle here, if you're going for the brain it'll catch this guy, maybe, as a cone that goes down this way.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Unless you want to go this way and hit these guys, or this guy.
Liam: You could get the edge of the brain.
Laura: Yeah, can I do the edge on the brain and get--
Matt: Yeah. You can get, you can get probably these guys there.
Laura: All right, let's do that.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So they get saving throws, right? How does that work?
Laura: Yes, they get saving throws.
Matt: So roll damage, and we'll see what their saving throws are.
Laura: Okay. But do I have to roll to see if it hits, or it just hits?
Matt: No, for that one, it's just a barrage and they get to roll a saving throw against it.
Laura: Oh! Okay, cool. 17?
Matt: All right.
Laura: Plus Hunter's Mark? On the Elder Brain.
Matt: Yeah, so the Elder Brain takes additional damage.
Laura: Three additional. Do I get plus two for the bracers on that Conjure Barrage?
Matt: Technically, yes you would, because they're ranged.
Laura: Okay, so that would've been 19.
Matt: 19. All right. Cool. And then this guy fails its save, so total damage on him?
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19 on him? Okay. So it's still alive, just looking really, really rough. The brain's just now pierced with a bunch of arrows, some of it, it's barely holding itself on top of its feet. And the troll also takes the damage as well, just seems to shrug it off, just seems to angrily-- roars up from the bottom of the temple at you, now seemingly helpless in the current circumstance.
Laura: So then I want to attack the Elder Brain again.
Matt: All right. So you release it down.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Very nice, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: All right. 11.
Matt: 11 points of damage, all right.
Laura: Oh, wait, wait! No, lies! 13.
Matt: 13, okay, there we go.
Travis: (laughs) No, lies.
Matt: (laughs) Reach down again, release this one, aiming towards the now torn-open wound on the side of the Elder Brain as the arrow now sinks in, there's another pulse of purple energy, and you hear, all of you simultaneously in your heads this scream, this screech (screech) that echoes through your heads. As it does, the two illithid that were hovering towards it grab their heads momentarily out of frustration and glare up at you angrily.
Orion: Ooh! I took notice of this.
Matt: That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm going to take the rest of my burrow speed to get up to the top.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I'm assuming I'm there?
Matt: You just manage to make it to the top of the temple, yeah.
Marisha: Okay. Drop earth elemental.
Matt: All right. Keyleth is on the field.
Marisha: Would you say--
Sam: Oh boy. (laughter)
Matt: Nothing good ever comes out of this. What do you got, Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Theoretically.
Matt: Theoretically?
Marisha: Our brains are made up of water, right? Would you say that there is water in the like jello brain mold, like water molecules would be in it?
Matt: Make an arcana check.
Marisha: Okay. I don't know much in terms of arcana, but I can try. Ten.
Matt: You have no idea. You have never encountered an Elder Brain before.
Laura: Yeah, give it a try!
Taliesin: Give it a try!
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to cast Control Water. I'm going to assume that there's water, it's 300 feet, I got the range and I'm going to take the brain where it's already kind of sliced down the middle where Vex has already made progress, I'm going to take it and I'm just going to rip it apart.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier to it.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Wait, you're saying brains are made of water?
Taliesin: Whoa!
Marisha: 23.
Matt: Okay. There is an element of liquid to its structure, however it is difficult to extract it from a form that you're unfamiliar with, let alone one that's this stable. You manage to find a way to pull moisture out of parts of it and actually deal damage to it as you're beginning to shrivel sections of the brain. Go ahead and roll 3d6. You do 3d6 points of dehydration damage.
Marisha: I'll take it, I'll take it.
Ashley: Make some brain jerky.
Marisha: They'll have a really bad hangover tomorrow.
Matt: Oh yeah. Oh, you don't even know the half of it.
Marisha: Ooh! Just 3d6 or plus anything?
Matt: Just 3d6.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: 15, all right. 15 points of dehydration damage to the Elder Brain. You can see now the portion of the wound that's been opened, the corners of it kind of shrivel in and tuck in and the actual purple glow in the inside dulls slightly. And you now have, currently, in the air, a small amorphous globule of brain fluid that's just kind of floating there in this, in the air.
Ashley: Awesome.
Laura: Gross.
Marisha: Cool. (laughter)
Marisha: Scanlan, smell it! Smell it!
Sam: No, thank you.
Matt: Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Did you say there was illithid coming up on the sides, too?
Matt: Yeah, they're swarming up the side. They're probably about halfway up.
Orion: Okay. I turn to the group. I suggest we go to the beach immediately. There we can shore up defenses and I can cast a spell and get us out of here. As I say that, I go (fwwt) and throw a Fireball right at that fucker's head.
Matt: Okay. Are you using your movement to bring the carpet, to take control of the carpet from Percy and move it up higher?
Orion: No, I'm up top. I have Fly on myself.
Matt: Oh, that's right. Sorry. Yeah. All right, so.
Orion: Yeah, I just let a Fireball down on the brain.
Matt: Into the brain, all right. All right, so that's enough to get both of these guys. Go ahead and roll damage. And they both failed their save, so full damage.
Travis: Crush the nuts.
Ashley: Little brains.
Matt: I like that, good.
Orion: 40.
Matt: 40?
Laura: Whoa!
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: Those incinerate. And 40 points of damage to the Elder Brain as this giant echoing explosion blasts up from below. All of you at the top, you are underlit momentarily from the flash of red and yellow flame. As you look down, there's now a sizzling sound and this like smell of horrible burnt flesh as part of the Elder Brain now that was originally dehydrated is now also burnt and singed. You can see now, it's looking a little rougher and it's very very unhappy with its current circumstance.
Laura: I want to kill it before we leave now.
Matt: All right. Pike, go ahead and make a saving throw.
Marisha: Come on, Pike!
Laura: Why a saving throw?
Matt: Still trying to get rid of the stun.
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: So intellect saving throw.
Ashley: 16?
Matt: 16. You shrug off the effect--
Ashley: Yeah! Man. Thanks, Keyleth. Much better now.
Marisha: New dice!
Sam: What? I've been doing it wrong this whole time.
Ashley: Can I do anything, or that's my turn?
Matt: That's your turn.
Orion: My movement, by the way is I head to the beach.
Sam: You're ghosting?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: You just get the fuck out of Dodge, Tiberius is that way.
Ashley: Wait, where do we go? Nobody's taking us?
Laura: No, you've got to hop on the carpet when it comes up.
Ashley: Oh, okay, got it.
Marisha: Classic Tiberius.
Taliesin: All right, here's a question  can everybody still fly?
Matt: Vax?
Orion: As long as I'm thinking about it.
Liam: Well I'm still sitting, still kneeling on the flying carpet with Percy, so I'm just throwing daggers at the bacon brain.
Matt: Okay. They're at disadvantage at this distance.
Liam: Okay. So that means, aw man, 17 on the first.
Matt: 17? (ricochet sound) Reflected, deflected by the arcane shield on the brain.
Liam: All right, so then the second one does as well, and the last one definitely does, so.
Matt: Yeah, so all three just (ping, ping, ping).
Taliesin: Take the wheel!
Matt: As it gets more and more damaged, it's waking up more and more and it looks like it's actually gaining power the more it does.
Liam: Okay, and then Percy yelled in my ear, so I take some of the little carpet tassels.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. So as your movement, you manage to move the carpet all the way up, it swoops up into the center of--
Laura: Grab the gnomes!
Matt: This right here. You guys are all looking precariously at this carpet that is now floating up from the center of the temple. As you get to the top, you look over and you can see there's probably close to 20 mind flayers that are swarming up the side. That brings us to, Vax, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I pull out Bad News. And I'm going to lie down on my stomach, hanging off the edge of the carpet.
Sam: Hanging brain!
Taliesin: And I'm taking a shot straight down.
Matt: Okay. I'll say it takes you your--
Taliesin: My movement.
Matt: Movement to get it out. So you're there, you're unable to move the carpet, you pull the Bad News out, you get down, you're precariously off the side of it, and it is sagging as your weight touches it, you get ready, go ahead and fire.
Taliesin: Firing a deadshot.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, come on.
Taliesin: That's 18.
Matt: As you fire, the blast sends you up almost onto your feet on the carpet again, and you hear this impact sound, this (crash) of the blast hitting stone as the psychic field around it deflects the bullet, sending it into the ground.
Laura: I thought 18 was the number that we were aiming for-- shit.
Taliesin: Wait, did I have an inspiration dice from last-- fuck.
Orion: You did.
Taliesin: I did have an inspiration dice from last game! I did! What do you give people with it?
Sam: d10.
Taliesin: d10? Oh fuck, that's right.
Orion: Can he add it now?
Matt: Yeah, I'll trust you on that.
Taliesin: I did! I did, because I'm always excited when I get them, because I never get them.
Matt: That's true, okay, yeah. All right. Go ahead and roll for that.
Taliesin: 21!
Matt: That'll do it.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: As the brain continues to wake up, it improves its defenses, improves its capabilities--
Laura: Oh, I understand.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: But that will hit. So go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: Okay.
Orion: It's Hulking?
Matt: Essentially. So as you release the blast, it hits the psychic field, the first impact you hear is it hitting the psychic field and pushing through into the actual brain matter.
Marisha: Come on!
Taliesin: Let me double-check that I'm doing this right, hold on, deadshot's weird. Plus weapon damage. Okay, so that's eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13... 25 points of damage.
Matt: 25 points of damage. Boom! You see the section of it that's kinda charred and burned gets blown off, and now there's a corner of the brain that's just an open and gaping wound. The purplish glow on the inside is pulsing more and more angrily. It's taken a beating, but it's hanging in there.
Taliesin: Oh my god!
Marisha: Will not die.
Matt: This is, you guys have left a good mark on it. You get the sensation, with the swarming incoming, you may start to consider self-preservation, because the Elder Brain looks like it's taken some hits, but it's not on death's door yet.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Marisha: Let's get out.
Laura: We need to go.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Scanlan is up?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: We're out of here?
Taliesin: We need everybody to hop on the carpet first.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: You're hopping up?
Sam: No, I'm going to turn into a huge pterodactyl and carry some folks.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: What?
Laura: You can do that?
Sam: Sure, why not?
Marisha: He's got Polymorph.
Travis: Yeah, turn into a batwing.
Matt: Cool, so we'll say for the time being, we'll use this as Scanlan.
Sam: Great.
Matt: You are a giant pterodactyl, a creature that you've read in books in the past, you haven't actually seen in person. And what are you doing?
Sam: Who can I carry?
Matt: You can carry one person with your claws. You haven't used this form before, and this is you figuring it out, so pick one and you can take them with you.
Sam: I'm going to take someone heavy.
Liam: Grog.
Matt: Grog can fly.
Laura: I can fly on Trinket, yeah, everybody's covered, man.
Sam: There's only one person I can take.
Matt: As the pterodactyl Scanlan swoops down and both its claws grapple on your arms and lift you off the top of the temple, flying after Tiberius.
Taliesin: How do you make that weird?
Matt: All right, so they're now out of harm's way. Very top of the round, that brings us to Grog. Still carrying Kima under your arm.
Travis: We're getting out, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: So I don't have to worry, so up and out.
Matt: So you just awkwardly fly with Kima under your arm, off with the rest of the group.
Liam: (sings) Sweet bird of prey, fly, fly away.
Sam: (sings) Up, up, and away, I'm a beautiful pterodactyl.
Matt: We'll get these guys off the board here because you do have two Illithid that get up to the edge here. They're going to attempt a Mind Blast.
Liam: We're gone, man, we're gone!
Laura: Not yet.
Matt: Still holding back. So--
Liam: I jump up to get out of range.
Matt: That can just get Trinket and Vex, if you can go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw for both of you.
Liam: Don't fuck with my sister.
Orion: Trinket and Vex are still there?
Laura: Yeah. I know, I didn't get to--
Sam: They never flew.
Laura: I know, I didn't use the movement on the last turn.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: I just didn't say it because I'm an asshole.
Sam: You are.
Liam: What kind of saving throw?
Matt: Intelligence.
Sam: Intelligence.
Laura: Ten? On me.
Matt: Okay. Roll for Trinket.
Liam: You rolled nine, plus two is 11.
Laura: Oh. Okay. 11.
Matt: So go ahead and roll for Trinket.
Laura: Oh! I rolled a nine, plus two, plus two.
Liam: For what?
Laura: For my ring that I'm wearing.
Liam: Okay.
Laura: So whatever that was.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 13.
Liam: 13.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: For me.
Matt: And roll for Trinket.
Laura: Which is going to be a major fail because Trinket is the dumbest. (laughter)
Sam: Don't talk about Trinket like that.
Travis: Is he the dumbest?
Laura: No, that's a minus four. So that would be a nine for Trinket.
Matt: Nine for Trinket.
Laura: Who is, by the way, my only way to get out of here right now.
Matt: So communally, both you and Trinket freeze in place, and Trinket, who is flying, slumps onto the top of the temple, limply laying across the edge, about to tip over off the temple.
Sam: (whispering) Told you we should've left Trinket behind.
Matt: That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: A lot of Sandmen in there.
Marisha: Well first and foremost I'm going to get on the carpet.
Matt: Okay. So you leap up here with these guys.
Marisha: Secondly, I am going to-- Okay, wait, Trinket's stunned?
Matt: Trinket is currently catatonic (moans), just barely holding herself right there. You can see she's struggling with the flight spell, like she's kind of levering herself into the ground--
Laura: Trinket's a boy.
Matt: Him, sorry. I was thinking of you.
Laura: If he's about to die, at least get his gender right.
Matt: I apologize, Trinket. I'm sorry.
Marisha: Wait, shove him?
Taliesin: Shove him onto the carpet.
Marisha: No, I can't shove him.
Sam: Wait, he's floating.
Marisha: Okay, can I do this? Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm on the carpet. I'm going to cast Grasping Vine from the carpet and wrap around Trinket and have a Trinket tow vine.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Like the Macy's Day parade!
Matt: So as you leap onto the carpet, you reach down, and the fibrous nature that the carpet was originally made from, you manage to pull the essence of that out to create a vine of similarly patterned color of the actual magic carpet material. The various silks form into this tendril that wraps around both you and Trinket and pulls you guys hanging behind the carpet, so you guys are essentially now towed to the carpet.
Marisha: Let's go!
Orion: Can she take control of the carpet, too?
Marisha: Can I now use the rest of my movement to be like--
Matt: You currently do not have control of the carpet because you used your action and everything to use that spell and your concentration at that point.
Marisha: Okay, I'm just holding.
Matt: You're just holding them there. That brings us to Tiberius, you're off, flying off. Pike is off, Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm steering us the fuck outta here, man.
Matt: You tow Trinket and Vex out behind. As you guys pull off at full speed, the rest of the illithid swarm to the top, you can see about 15 or so get to the front top here, look down at the Elder Brain, look up at the rest of you with this angry look, and as you're pulling away, your eyes adjust to the darkness of the cavern and you look down and you swear you can see hundreds and hundreds of sets of purple glowing eyes just staring up from the city as you all slowly fly away to the far end of the cavern. As you're moving, so are the eyes.
Laura: (sings) We've made some enemies. They're coming after us.
Orion: I want to make a note, because I'm way ahead of everybody at this point, as soon as I land on the beach, I cast Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Barring that there's nobody there, but I do that immediately.
Matt: All right, so. A few minutes go by, you guys are moving past and over the water channel that's between the north side of the island and the beach where you guys previously set. (laughter)
Matt: As Tiberius, you land on the dirt. You land, immediately begin casting the Circle of Teleportation, you begin scrawling this circle on the ground, running your finger across the gravel surface to build the runes. As your fingers drag across, you can see the arcane light beginning to glow and form the sigils and the runes as you're drawing them feverishly. The rest of the group eventually catches up to you about 30 seconds into it. As you all eventually get back, you and Trinket manage to shrug off the effect. And you find yourselves halfway through being towed by this vine awkwardly.
Laura: What is happening right now?
Marisha: Stupid wrench.
Matt: A few seconds pass, you finish the incantation, you place your hand down on the center of the sigil, this wave of arcane energy blasts off, and suddenly, above this circle, this tearing sound pulls out of the middle of the ether, and this kind of purple shimmering doorway opens above the circle sigil that he crafted on the side of the beach.
Orion: By the blessings of Bahamut, I choose Emon!
Matt: At which point, the doorway that he just created takes some sort of a solid form and from what you can see on the other side, there appears to be some sort of low-lit room.
Liam: Greyskull!
Laura: (gasps) Greyskull!
Orion: I run right through.
Matt: All right. Tiberius runs through. Everyone else?
All: Yes!
Sam: Are we there?
Matt: You guys have all landed on the beach as he finished casting this, yeah.
Laura: Run!
Marisha: Run!
Matt: You all rush through the portal, one after the other, towards the very end is Grog, you bringing up the rear, holding Kima, you go rushing towards it as it begins to slowly close, this only lasts a round, you barrel through just in time as it closes behind you with a sparking sound.
Taliesin: We are time bandits. (cheering)
Travis: Oh, fuck. I just caked my pants.
Taliesin: Squish-squish.
Laura: I hate that phrase.
Orion: That was something, now, wasn't it?
Taliesin: That was fantastic.
Travis: Chocolate cake.
Matt: You all emerge within a small 20-foot-by-20-foot white stone chamber. You all are kinda crammed in this space currently, but you are all apparently safe and sound. As the doorway closes behind you, you turn and look, and on the ground there is a similar circle across the stone flooring, different patterns, different, you know, arrangement to the one that he had drawn, but with some similarities that are kind of a reminiscent glow, almost like a code to this circle, fade away, based on what he had drawn previously.
Laura: They won't be able to open that back up?
Orion: We are safe.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Just a quick request  she is made of stone. Holding Lady Kima.
Ashley: Yes! I'll go over and cast Greater Restoration on Kima.
Orion: Hold on just one second.
Travis: Hold on.
Orion: We still have the Horn to deal with.
Taliesin: The Horn is on the carpet. It has been specifically not touched.
Matt: So it's just kind of sitting there. The carpet's bunched to the side now as you guys kind of flew into the portal and kind of left it there and the Horn's just resting there.
Orion: I think we should get it out of her view before--
Taliesin: I think we should put it in the Bag of Holding.
Travis: Sure, yeah. Do you want to teleport it in the bag?
Ashley: If your crushing couldn't kill it, the thousand pounds?
Orion: We can store it there.
Liam: Where are we? You said we're in a room.
Matt: It's a small yellow room, sorry, a small white stone room and there is a kind of yellowish brown stone doorway that is closed. There's some very faint white orbs that are locked into the wall. So you're not in Greyskull Keep now.
Marisha: Oh, we're not in Greyskull.
Matt: You guys don't have a teleportation circle installed in your Keep yet. You don't know where you are.
Sam: We're in a room right now?
Matt: You're in a room, you're in a 20-foot-by-20-foot room, with two small white orbs on the sides that are kinda set into the walls to give off a faint white arcane glow. There's a single doorway that exits the room that is currently closed.
Orion: The way Circle of Teleportation works is when I learned it I get to pick two locations that I know innately. I picked Emon as one of them.
Laura: Oh, okay. Okay.
Marisha: So we're somewhere in Emon.
Orion: But I just had to pick the two.
Marisha: So we could be in someone's living room right now?
Orion: I'll use Telekinesis to lift the Horn off the carpet.
Matt: Okay. You still have the spells?
Orion: Yeah, I can burn one from my Ioun stone.
Laura: Should we wrap it at all?
Taliesin: It'll be fine in the Bag of Holding.
Liam: Not knowing what else to do, Vax is going to go to the door and just inspect it, see if it's trapped.
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. All right, the door does appear to be locked. It is not trapped.
Liam: Not trapped. Okay, I'll get to work on it, then. 32.
Matt: Okay, 32. You, relatively easy, the door comes unlocked, the small, it's like a very very intricately carved brass handle that has swirls upon it, like it's almost like a burst of wind being blown and frozen in gold. You turn it and the door opens slightly.
Liam: Pull up, I'm still wearing my tin hat and I pull up my hood from my elven cloak, and I go stealth. And I am stealthed, because that's a 32. And I have a look around outside the door.
Matt: Okay. As you open the doorway, it leads into a secondary chamber. This is an 80-foot-diameter circular chamber now, so you're entering the edge of a giant circle. There are a series of other doors, almost in respective rows next to each other, and you also see, in the center of the room, a vibrant chandelier made of white crystal like the spheres you saw in the previous room you were in, giving off a warm, atmospheric glow to the entire room. In the center of the room, there is a semi-circle desk that is also made of a similar white stone material that the rest of the room is made out of, with polished gold leaf trimming on the edge, and you do see what looks to be an elven man sitting at the desk, longish gray-white hair, he's wearing robes that are finely dressed, and he's half-falling asleep at a desk with a series of books kind of piled up on the side. As soon as the doorway opens, he looks up, and you hear a slight little arcane tinging sound, like a little bell being rung, as you open the door. He looks up for a second.
Laura: Say hello.
Liam: Yes yes yes. I just walk forward and pull down the cloak and say, "Hello."
Matt: "Stay right where you are! Do not move!"
Liam: Hands up in the air.
Matt: "Do not move!"
Liam: Nothing in them. No threat, no danger here. A little lost, apparently.
Matt: "Apparently."
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "Who else is in, who else goes there? Who else, please, step outside! Reveal yourselves!"
Liam: They're--
Laura: Hi!
Marisha: Hi.
Ashley: Hello.
Sam: (pterodactyl screech)
Matt: As soon as he sees you, he goes, (screams).
Orion: I cast Dispel Magic on Scanlan.
Sam: Do you have it anymore?
Orion: Yeah, I do.
Sam: You just did it to me earlier in this round.
Orion: No, Counterspell, and I Silenced you, this is Dispel Magic, which ends your spell.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Sam: Oh. Hello.
Matt: So as you cast the spell and transform, he stops in the middle of casting a spell reflexively and goes, "Oh. And a bear. Interesting."
Orion: He's friendly.
Sam: He's real.
Liam: I have a very long, very strange story, every word of which is true, and if you will give me five minutes, I swear I can convince you--
Matt: He opens a book and starts thumbing through the pages.
Liam: No ill intent. Intent? Yes.
Matt: "We have no expected arrivals at this hour. I need to know your business, your names, and your affiliations immediately."
Marisha: We will totally do that when we know--
Laura: We are affiliated with the king.
Liam: Yeah, emperor. Just tell the emperor that Vox Machina has returned from Kraghammer, and we have news for him, and--
Matt: "Well."
Laura: We were on very secret business for the crown, actually. And that is why you weren't informed of our business.
Orion: Yeah, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. How are you?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Did you wink?
Orion: I'm responsible for casting the spell to get us here to begin with.
Laura: (laughs) With advantage.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: That would be a 20-- no. 35.
Matt: All right. He looks to you, as you guys are saying, he--
Laura: That's not possible. 25.
Matt: 25. (laughter)
Matt: He stands up from the desk and gives you all a look-over and says, "Well, I am Gatekeeper Xanthas, I am the evening keeper of the Traverse Junction here in the-- it's the Traverse Junction."
Orion: Gatekeeper?
Matt: "Here within the Lyceum. The hour is late. We are two hours past midnight."
Taliesin: Well, I am Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, and, hello, and we would love to report to the emperor of your great hospitality at this unfortunately early hour, and we would look forward to reporting of all of your kindness and good housekeeping.
Liam: I imagine he would be very upset if we were delayed. We come with very grave news.
Taliesin: I would hope not to imagine it.
Matt: "Well. I'm certain the Headmaster would like to know your business in the morning."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Headmaster Thurmond. He runs this Alabaster Lyceum within the Erudite Quarter. If you would please submit a report for your reasons for using the Lyceum Junction property by tomorrow, I'm sure that would suffice for the required paperwork."
Laura: Of course we will.
Taliesin: You are too kind.
Laura: In the meantime, we'll just go to our Keep that we have in town.
Orion: Greyskull Keep.
Matt: Gives you a very, a disbelieving look and kinda goes, "Very well."
Taliesin: Good day, good evening.
Sam: I cast Friends on him and I tell him, "You know of our Keep, don't you?"
Matt: Okay. He goes, "I seem to recall hearing about a Vox Machina at some point discussed, but I don't get out very often. Running the graveyard shift here at the Lyceum has taken its toll on my social life."
Laura: You poor thing, you should get out more.
Matt: "Well here, let me show you out." And he walks you through the rest of the hallways. It's a beautiful, beautiful kind of domed center chamber into a long series of white stone hallways, similar material to what the first room you arrived in looked like. Eventually to a main foyer area, which has a very high ceiling and a series of beautifully carved pillars that show different creatures, almost like devas and demons battling each other as they spiral up these pillars, to the front doorways. There are two guards that are adorned in kinda silver and gold armor with these very high, elven in design-shaped helmets, and they step to the side as the doors open on their own.
Laura: Love the hat.
Matt: Guards do not respond to you whatsoever, they just step to the side. Gatekeeper says, "All right, well, here is your way out, have a wonderful evening and do please return for your report on the morrow."
Laura: Of course.
Sam: Oh, one more question before you leave, what district are we in right now?
Matt: "The Erudite Quarter."
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: Gesundheit.
Matt: "Good night." The doors slam (boof) behind you as you guys exit, and you're now--
Laura: Holy shit, we survived! What was that?
Marisha: Oh my god! Keyleth just goes down on her knees and starts kissing the ground.
Taliesin: Well, that could've gone worse.
Marisha: Oh, we're home.
Ashley: I just want to get in my bed so bad.
Marisha: Look! Stars!
Matt: You look up and, for the first time in close to a week, you can see stars, you can see a crescent moon, probably just past its single quarter phase. It is a sight for sore eyes right now.
Ashley: I'm so happy.
Travis: Would you say it's a beautiful sight?
Matt: Currently? The most beautiful night sky you've seen in all of your years.
Travis: I ruin it with a fart. (laughter)
Orion: I'm glad you held that the whole time we were down there, Grog.
Travis: I've had horrible stomach pains this whole time, I'm sorry.
Laura: What, are we just carrying around this stone Kima with us, or are we taking her back to our--
Liam: Yes, but don't stand right in front of her when you undo the stone.
Orion: Actually, hold on a minute, let's all rest before we deal with this one.
Travis: Yes.
Ashley: No, because I want to be able to have an extra 5th-level spell.
Travis: Oh, right.
Laura: But we're in town now, so we're safe.
Ashley: Yeah, let's go to the Keep.
Laura: Yeah, so it'll be fine.
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: It's a long way. We've got to go across the whole town to get there.
Laura: Well, we've got a fucking flying carpet.
Sam: We do have a flying carpet.
Taliesin: The metro's running at this hour.
Liam: We can probably flag down a wagon, too.
Laura: Yeah, we're in town!
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Fuck it. Everything's possible.
Taliesin: Let's go drinking.
Marisha: I was going to say, what bars are open?
Liam: We've got a lot of bling and a cursed Horn. The sky's the limit.
Ashley: I know, should we go to a tavern and get some ale?
Sam: What, who are you?
Travis: Really? You mean it?
Ashley: Well what do you mean, do I mean it?
Travis: It's all empty, can we fill it please?
Ashley: It's all empty?
Marisha: We should get some ale. Wait, maybe we should drop off the Bag of Holding so we're not carrying it around.
Travis: And the stone gnome.
Marisha: And then go out drinking.
Liam: We don't want to lose it in a game of cards.
Marisha: Yes, exactly. Exactly.
Travis: And stone Kima.
Sam: We'll be fine, we've never lost it before. There's eight of us, we'll be fine, let's go drinking.
Ashley: How far is the Keep from here?
Matt: I'd say it's probably a good hour walk.
Marisha: Oh, we've got time.
Taliesin: We could do a pub crawl, we'll just have a beer at every pub we hit on the way back to the Keep.
Marisha: Yes, let's do that! Pub crawl!
All: Pub crawl!
Marisha: We're going to pub crawl back to the Keep.
Liam: Starting here at Geek & Sundry.
Ashley: But should I go just in a bush just behind and--
Sam: Do you have to pee or something?
Ashley: No, and cast Greater Restoration on Kima?
All: No!
Sam: We want to enjoy this.
Orion: She doesn't have a sense of time, she won't know.
Sam: Or humor.
Travis: Let's put her in the bag. She's made of stone!
Laura: We won't tell her how much time has passed.
Taliesin: We'll un-stone her once we're back at the Keep.
Travis: She's stone. Stone doesn't breathe. Right?
Taliesin: It'll be fine.
Sam: We don't know.
Laura: Do not put her in the Bag of Holding! Do not. (laughter)
Liam: For the record, I think she'd be fine, too. But we could bring her around and introduce her; it could be like Weekend at Bernie's. (laughter)
Travis: Ah, yes! I put a fancy robe around Kima's stone statue.
Laura: This is so messed up.
Matt: All right, so as you guys begin making your celebratory pub crawl, starting with the Laughing Lamia Tavern, you buy drinks, laugh, chatter, and kind of take in the lively atmosphere that you would find at 3AM. Which is a little, at this point most of the fun folk are pretty drunk, but at this point you don't care, you'll take your own, and we'll take a quick five-minute break to use the bathroom and we'll pick up from there in just a moment, we'll see you guys here in five minutes to continue.
Travis: We lived!
Marisha: We lived!
Matt: Holy shit, guys.
Orion: I was fine. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time.
Matt: Welcome back. We got a little refresher here and apparently our Overlord has an announcement.
Zac: You guys, we're only four away from another giveaway, which is--
Lucas: Two away!
Zac: Two away, you know what, I'm guessing this is, we're going to get that before I even get back to my seat, so we're going to go do the giveaway. It's the shirt, the dice, the handbook, and the starter set. The handbook and the shirt will be signed by the cast.
Matt: Yep.
Zac: And we still have, if we get to 400, correct, next? Lucas?
Lucas: Yeah. 3,400.
Matt: 3,400.
Zac: If we get to 3,400 by the end of the night, we'll give away a whole other kit like this, with the signed stuff, so you get to subscribe and it supports the channel, keeps us running. I'm not going to interrupt these guys, so when we hit the number I'm just going to give it away through the chat room.
Matt: Awesome, guys. Well done and congrats to whoever ends up getting that, real fast I hope. So, thank you Overlord.
Taliesin: Oh wait, this is in here. Can I throw this? Oh no.
Matt: Pass it off, it's fine.
Taliesin: You get the horn.
Laura: Can I hold it for a second?
Travis: No.
Orion: No. Oh, I mean in real life. Yeah.
Marisha: No.
Orion: I was like, don't touch it.
Matt: So. Eventually you all manage to make your way towards the outer wall of Emon to the southern portion of the city. The guards let you through. Two of them recognize you from the Winter's Crest celebration that occurred about seven months beforehand. Don't do that, that's going to end poorly. You make your way around the bend to the large grass hill that is surrounded by the river that skirts the outer southern portion of Greyskull Keep. Looking up, you can see against the moonlight the very welcome sight of your home there, beckoning to you to rest. You make your way to the front gates that surround the outskirts of it, and an iron bell kind of goes off for a second, and as you look up, you hear a voice go, "Who goes there? Speak your mind, or a bolt to the throat you'll find."
Marisha: Shayne, is that Shayne?
Orion: Is it dark right now?
Matt: It's dark, yes.
Orion: I cast Light. "It's us!"
Matt: Okay, a light pierces off, and you guys look up and you can see, sitting on kind of the watchtower perch--
Marisha: Or wait, is that Jarett?
Matt: No, you see up there, short, rough red hair, Shayne Tranter, one of the mercenaries you hired--
Marisha: Oh, it is Shayne, I was right the first time!
Matt: She's got her crossbow ready to go, and she's just kind of sitting back and pointing it at the group, and she goes,
Liam: Hello! Hi!
Laura: Hope you remember us!
Marisha: Shayne!
Taliesin: We're drunk!
Sam: We pay you!
Matt: She laughs. Takes her crossbow, sets it to her side.
Ashley: We forgot our key!
Matt: "Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? It's been nearly a week since you left."
Laura: That's it?
Sam: Feels like a month.
Ashley: Feels like three months.
Taliesin: Feels like eleven weeks. It feels like a very long time.
Matt: "Well, it's probably closer to two weeks. Fair enough. Either way. Open the gates! Cordell, open the gates!"
Sam: Cordell? I don't remember the names of any of our guards.
Matt: Cordell, he's one of the other half-orc guards that you hired when you left.
Marisha: We have Shayne, Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick, and Nitebe.
Laura: Jarett was the one we appointed as the head guard, right? Captain?
Marisha: Jarett? I think so. I didn't write that part down.
Laura: I don't remember about the little fellow.
Sam: Our staff is so unappreciated, guys.
Matt: So as the gate slowly opens, Cordell walking out, this is the hearty half-orc merc dressed in scale armor, and he has a large sword slung on his back, just shoves it open to about a two-foot distance. "Come on. Welcome home." As each of you guys walk through, he kinda claps you on the back as you walk in. You make your way into the small courtyard leading to-- making your way into Greyskull Keep. Towards the front door, as you get there, the front door opens on its own as you're about ten feet away and peering from the inside of the low-lit interior you see a woman's face, a plump blond woman's face, peek through. This is Laina. Laina goes, "Oh, you're back, fantastic! It's early." And she rubs her face and you see as she pushes the door open a little more, she's wearing her nightgown, and she's excited but still very tired. "Come in, come in, come in, please, please! Who's that?" And points to the large stone statue you're dragging behind you.
Laura: Oh, we decided to get a statue for the garden.
Taliesin: Garden gnome.
Matt: "Very well, very well, come in."
Ashley: Hey! (laughter)
Travis: He's drunk.
Taliesin: I'm drunk!
Matt: So the human woman leads you all back in.
Laura: Put the gun down, Percy.
Ashley: Bad News.
Liam: It's not Cinco de Mayo.
Matt: She steps back with her knitted boots; she's definitely in comfortable mode. She eagerly hugs each of you as you enter, happy that you've all arrived, she's like, "I swear it's-- I've not had an employer leave so quickly after my hiring. But glad to see you're all safe. Shall I make everyone a meal, are you hungry?"
Marisha: Starving.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: "I'll get right to it." And she turns around, and you see further down the hallway Erwen Dastell, your older halfling servant who shuffles up with his nightcap on, it's long and dangling off his shoulders, he's got this long night robe on, he's kinda carrying a small candle. "My goodness. The hour is late of your arrival, but I can't say I am not excited to see you. Come in, your beds are ready, everything's been cleaned and made to your specifications. Laina! To food!" "I'm already on it, Erwen." She kinda smacks him on the back. He says, "Very well, then."
Sam: I love their banter.
Laura: Yeah, they're so cute.
Matt: "I will go back to bed, if that's fine with you."
Sam: Is there any urgent, oppressing news, any visitors that we should know about who came while we were gone, anything before you retire for the evening?
Matt: "No, I believe your friend, the mage woman with the blue robes came by once."
Sam: Allara?
Matt: "Allura. She came by a couple days ago, just to see if you had returned. But I didn't know where you were, and she said she'd try again later."
Sam: Any packages, mail, post?
Matt: "None that I know of, no. In fact it's been very quiet."
Sam: All right, thank you.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Quiet is good.
Matt: "Back to my quarters." And he shuffles off, goes towards his bed. You guys make your way into the main dining chamber of your Keep, four large round tables set out with the chairs around it. You can see, for the most part, it's been untouched other than a couple of chairs that are set ajar, probably by your mercenary soldiers who've been eating and/or have been keeping up. There's a couple of empty tables set on the side that immediately Laina goes, "I'm so sorry, I guess I should've taken care of this." And she stumbles off towards the kitchen and you guys all eventually find yourselves sitting, sore, exhausted, mildly intoxicated, around these chairs and take a very deep-breathing sigh of relief at being back home here in Emon in Greyskull Keep.
Sam: Should we un-stone Kima, or should we sleep on it?
Orion: I stand up and I head towards the sleeping quarters and I just say, "Leave her to stone tonight, we'll deal with it tomorrow." And I go to bed.
Sam: I turn him into a rat.
Liam: Dispel Magic.
Matt: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw, Tiberius.
Orion: Hold on a sec. I can still cast as an animal, right?
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Nope, you cannot talk.
Orion: Oh. I still go to bed. (laughter)
Orion: So yeah.
Travis: Hoo baby.
Laura: That's adorable.
Matt: You go under your covers, go to sleep, nuzzle in.
Orion: In between my pillow.
Marisha: It's quite comfy sleeping like an animal.
Ashley: He's a little rat and he still went in his big bed.
Liam: I pick up the sleeping rat and just kinda scritch him.
Laura: He's in bed.
Liam: It's all right, he's fine. Look, see, his leg's going, he's dreaming about something nice.
Travis: We ate already, right?
Matt: You snacked a bit as you made it through the town, but for the most part like, a meal's being prepared. You begin to smell now the cooking of meat, Laina's setting it up for you guys.
Liam: You're dreaming of magical artifacts, aren't you?
Laura: Quick question, friends  So we kind of started a war, am I right?
Liam: Yeah. Pretty sure we did.
Laura: Kraghammer is potentially in grave danger, am I right?
Marisha: We might want to let them know.
Laura: We should probably let them know as soon as possible.
Liam: First of all, Clarota was lying through his noodles, and second, even if he wasn't, which he was, he's now fucking pissed off--
Laura: He's dead.
Liam: Well, they're all one hive-mind, right? Listen. This is number five tonight.
Taliesin: They weren't particularly connected until the very end, he was dead before they were actually connected.
Liam: They're angry. They were following us.
Taliesin: They may not know who we are.
Marisha: That's interesting.
Liam: You don't think they're going to scurry up the bottom of Kraghammer and tear that place apart?
Taliesin: We'll let them know, but we may have time, we hurt them very badly.
Liam: It took us about a week to get from Kraghammer in, so we've got about a week.
Marisha: Well, why don't we do some research, I mean, this was the first time.
Sam: Yeah, we'd have to stop them on the way out the hole, right? There's only one way in and out.
Ashley: Don't the dwarves already know that they were there, and they were already prepping for battle?
Sam: They don't really know what's coming for them.
Liam: They don't know anything about mind flayers, they know about weird things coming out, but not the mind flayers.
Travis: So let's send a pigeon or something.
Taliesin: The mind flayers have been down there for ages. There's nothing new.
Laura: You don't think they'll come up and attack?
Marisha: To be fair, we also did sort of release the mind flayers from their evil dictator.
Liam: Yeah, they seemed very grateful.
Sam: We could stop them on their way out.
Taliesin: I think this will also be a conversation that Lady Kima will have some--
Marisha: Okay, well, the thing we then need to immediately decide, before we un-stone Lady Kima, is what're we going to do with the Horn?
Taliesin: I think if we have Allura here, and begin that conversation, then we can have Allura's insight.
Marisha: Before we un-stone Lady Kima?
Taliesin: Yes. I think we tell Allura before we un-stone Lady Kima. Everything that's happened--
Liam: The only person, the only person that would remotely know is you, Tiberius, and I don't think--
Sam: He's a rat.
Liam: Oh, that's a good boy.
Travis: And he's asleep.
Liam: He didn't seem to know anything, I think Allura is the person to go to right now.
Laura: Well, you need to share it with us.
Ashley: Wake up from bed!
Travis: He's sleeping.
Taliesin: No, let's wait until Allura's here, I think, and we can--
Travis: Do we tell her, do we tell her we have the Horn? Or do we not?
Liam: Yes, yes, we do.
Marisha: Why don't we just wake up Tiberius?
Laura: Tiberius. Little darling!
Sam: I'm still punishing him.
Liam: I'm still cuddling him.
Orion: Did they wake me up?
Liam: No! I'm holding you.
Orion: Okay.
Liam: I don't want to wake you up.
Matt: You start to wake up, and then he scritches the side of your cheek and you go right back to sleep.
Laura: Damn it, he's so cute. I don't know what to do.
Matt: Laina comes out with plates for you guys and sets up these--
Travis: Thank. God.
Matt: They're not pretty, but functional meals of cooked pork, some fine mashed potatoes.
Travis: I would like to eat.
Matt: And you do ravenously, and this is the first warm meal you've really truly had in five, six days.
Travis: I take Lady Kima's portions and I--
Matt: There were no portions made for your garden structure.
Travis: Never know.
Matt: That's okay, there's plenty more.
Sam: So talk to Allura first, then unfreeze Lady Kima?
Liam: She sent us after Kima. Kima thinks that she's in the middle of a fight, the moment she comes out she'll be all hot and bothered--
Marisha: Okay, hang on, hang on. That's true, she did send us after Kima, so what if they're both on the side that we don't--
Travis: Yeah, Allura's going to unfreeze Kima.
Taliesin: We're going to have to trust somebody.
Travis: Why don't we just hold onto the Horn for a second and see what they do without it.
Laura: Why don't we tell them we didn't find it? Why don't we just hide the Horn?
Travis: We just hold onto it in the bag.
Marisha: Don't we have a safe? Didn't we build a safe in our Keep?
Matt: You did not have a safe built, but you could possibly have that done.
Ashley: Wait, so why are you guys so against giving the Horn to Kima?
Marisha: I just feel like if it's so terrible, why does she want it for herself?
Laura: She doesn't, she wants to hide it.
Ashley: Does she want to destroy it?
Laura: Maybe she wants to destroy it, maybe she wanted to get it up above ground so she could destroy it.
Sam: There's a second Horn, maybe she has the other one and wants the matching set.
Taliesin: Do we know that there's a second horn?
Laura: She's a paladin, she's good, paladins are good by--
Sam: I'm fine trusting her. I was fine trusting Clarota.
Travis: Do you want to wake up, do you have something important to say?
Marisha: Right, because no one of the church has ever been bad before.
Liam: We didn't trust Clarota. We were using him as much as he was using us.
Laura: Some of us truly trusted Clarota.
Liam: It went south. Well, most of us.
Travis: All right, fuck it, I walk over and I take the rat out of Vax's hands and I shake it awake.
Sam: He's still a rat!
Travis: I shake it a lot.
Marisha: I undo his Polymorph, I undo his Polymorph.
Sam: With what?
Matt: With what?
Marisha: By Polymorph.
Matt: You re-Polymorph him?
Marisha: Can I release Polymorph by using Polymorph?
Matt: No. It's his incantation.
Travis: I spit on Tiberius's head and rub it in vigorously.
Marisha: Scanlan, come on. We need to talk to him.
Orion: I'm trying to bite Grog. I am not happy.
Matt: It's like this viscous Grog spit mixed with chunks of pork and mashed potato rubbed in your fur.
Marisha: Scanlan, he's nipping! Scanlan. Tiberius is nipping. Please.
Sam: All right, fine. He's a human thing again.
Liam: He's not human at all.
Sam: A dragonborn.
Orion: Why did you wake me up? I was so comfy being furry! (laughter)
Orion: I always have scales. It was nice having fur!
Marisha: I told you. It's nice being cuddly.
Orion: I was so soft.
Laura: Tiberius, we're sorry to wake you.
Taliesin: Tiberius, we're having a lovely breakfast. Tell us a story.
Orion: Have I rested? What's going on?
Matt: No, it's been ten minutes.
Orion: What the fuck? (laughter)
Travis: Vex has a question for you.
Marisha: We're all still drunk and awake. We don't want to go to bed yet! Just, just talk with us.
Laura: I just want to hear your lovely little explanation, darling, about what the Horn is and why you don't trust Kima.
Orion: Oh!
Taliesin: Tell us a story.
Marisha: Tell us a story!
Laura: Please. You haven't told any of us anything.
Marisha: We haven't talked to you in a week.
Orion: The Horn of Orcus.
Matt: Horn of Orcus.
Orion: This thing comes from a devil, a demon. Nothing good could ever come from anything it made in existence. It needs to be destroyed. And I'm sorry. Let me articulate these words a little bit more. There is nothing that you can use this particular artifact for any reason of good. The fact that it is even here is a very bad sign because it was taken from one of these beasts.
Ashley: So why don't we destroy it?
Orion: That's exactly what we need to do.
Travis: Isn't that what Kima wanted?
Laura: What if they want to destroy it?
Orion: I don't think they wanted to bring it back.
Laura: Question. Why?
Orion: Because there is-- the liquid hot magma that was below where it was being held was very sufficient for it to be thrown in.
Marisha: That's true. See, I'm with him.
Laura: Wait, but your crushing fist couldn't destroy it, so maybe lava can't destroy it, so maybe it needs something extra special that only they know about.
Travis: It needs the Sword of Gryffindor.
Orion: No. Pike could destroy it.
Ashley: Ex-squeeze me? I don't think that's true.
Orion: Give yourself a little bit more credit. You killed a dragon.
Laura: You did kill a dragon.
Travis: You did kill a dragon.
Ashley: I did kill a dragon. Huzzah.
Marisha: And you died. And come back to life. By the way, we haven't talked about that. What was it like on the other side?
Travis: Let's stay on topic here.
Marisha: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little tipsy.
Liam: Vax shoves another flagon in front of Keyleth.
Ashley: I don't think I can destroy it.
Taliesin: From what I understand-- is it possible that it's not possible to destroy this and instead it has to be banished somewhere, perhaps?
Orion: No. If it could be a permanent banishment, yes. But we don't know what kind of plane and what creatures lie there that would, perhaps, come upon that artifact. What are the elements? Fire burns earth.
Laura: Wind blows.
Orion: Light destroys darkness. Pike, you're the only one who--
Sam: Rock beats scissors.
Orion: Exactly, Scanlan. You're the only one who could-- if your weapon had any kind of light enchantment on them, could probably smash this thing to bits. Then we would have to scatter the remnants, the pieces, far from each other, if not find different ways to destroy those pieces.
Laura: Why don't you trust them?
Orion: Because it comes from something that would--
Laura: Not the Horn. Why don't you trust Kima?
Orion: Because they wanted to bring it somewhere where they-- I don't know. Which is why I wanted you to do the half thing, where we could question Kima without her attacking us or trying to attempt to take the Horn from us.
Marisha: Well, here's my thing. Even if she has good intentions. Say she has good intentions and maybe they just wanted to bring the horn back to study it. And no one should be messing with this whatsoever.
Laura: I think they want to destroy it.
Taliesin: I'm of the opinion they probably want to banish it somewhere.
Travis: Yeah, I think they do.
Marisha: Then why don't we just agree to not hand it over.
Taliesin: No, this is good. This means that there's no reason, necessarily, not to trust them. We just know that we don't trust the Horn, and that's a perfectly reasonable way to come at it.
Liam: In the short term, Scanlan, are you able to send it to another dimension for a while?
Laura: No, I don't trust it anywhere out of our sight.
Sam: I cannot. It is not alive. I cannot.
Travis: Put it in the bag.
Laura: It's in the bag.
Taliesin: It's perfectly safe in the bag.
Travis: How about we rest, we put the Horn in the bag, we wake up Kima, we go, "Oh, we brought you back, sorry we don't have the Horn. If we did, what would you do with it?" And then we decide what we do.
Taliesin: I like half that plan.
Marisha: I kind of like that plan.
Orion: I like that plan, too.
Laura: I think we should tell her we didn't get it and see what she does.
Orion: Allura is somebody who should not be here when this conversation happens, because if they turn south, she's a more powerful sorcerer than I.
Marisha: We need to decide, do we tell her that we destroyed it, or do we tell her that we just didn't get it and that it's still down there.
Travis: We can't say destroyed because we don't know how we did that, right?
Laura: No, we didn't destroy it. We say, "Oh no, they, we got overrun and we had to leave."
Taliesin: But then they're going to tell us to go back for it.
Travis: That's fine, but if we ask like what she would've done if we had it, and when she leaves we go, "Hah, we have it."
Laura: Or we go, "Oh, well good, then actually we do have it, you can do that."
Travis: Yeah, if she wants to study it or use it or transform it into something, we don't give it to her, we try to destroy it ourselves. If she wants to banish it and do something that Tiberius is happy with, then we go like, "Hey, we have it."
Liam: When we meet her I don't think we should have it, I think one or two of us should take it away. We don't all have to be at that meeting.
Taliesin: I think we just keep it in the Bag of Holding, she'll never suspect.
Marisha: Well, hang on, it's in the Bag of Holding right now?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes.
Orion: Grog, is there nothing else in that bag of holding?
Travis: Nothing it can, we took out all the stuff it can turn into some like evil transformer or something.
Liam: You know, the other characters can make insight checks too, you know that, right?
Matt: There's a pile somewhere with armor.
Travis: Everything has out with parentheses next to it.
Liam: If we have it, then she's, she could say you're lying--
Laura: Or she might not be able to tell because we're so good at lying. (laughter)
Liam: I don't think your winks will work on her.
Sam: Legitimately, no one can tell when I'm lying.
Marisha: I mean, we could Stone Shape it and I could like Stone Shape it and bury it somewhere in our Keep.
Travis: One person should leave with it. I'll leave with it.
Liam: Yes, it's fucking simple.
Taliesin: That's genius.
Travis: Yeah, I'll leave. It's not like I'm going to talk to the sorcerers.
Liam: You and I could take a walk with it and play tiddlywinks or something in the woods. That's fine, what's wrong with that, it's easy.
Taliesin: That's a very good plan.
Orion: Do you want it very far away?
Travis: Yeah, you're a talker, I'm not.
Taliesin: No, we don't.
Marisha: Wait. You're talking about just taking a stroll through the forest with the Horn of Orcus?
Travis: No, I'll just hang out outside.
Orion: In the Keep, how about just stay in the Keep?
Liam: Just be somewhere else. Anywhere else.
Ashley: You could hang out in the temple downstairs.
Laura: I fall asleep on the table.
Travis: Shall we sleep?
Sam: Let's sleep and meet with Kima in the morning.
Taliesin: This was a fabulous breakfast, good night.
Liam: Vax gives his sleeping sister a wet willie.
Laura: Ugh!
Travis: I put my head right in my food and fall asleep.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's not forget, you've still got a funny toe.
Sam: I check my bed to make sure no one shat in it. (laughter)
Orion: I did leave a little rat turd before I got scooped out. Just so you know.
Laura: Trinket, let's go to bed.
Marisha: I turn, I go Minxie and I curl up by the fire.
Travis: Yeah, Minxie!
Liam: Scanlan! Turn Tiberius back into a rat.
Orion: Oh yes, I'm going to bed.
Liam: Back into a rat.
Marisha: You can curl up with me.
Sam: Would you like to be a rat?
Orion: I like being furry.
Sam: Well then, no. I'm still punishing you. (laughter)
Orion: That's fine. Have your fun tonight, people, you will have your licking in the morning. I go to sleep.
Matt: All right. You guys all go to rest for the evening, the best rest you've had in a long time, your beds are comfortable, well set, it's a warm interior.
Ashley: I'm starfished on my bed.
Matt: This is the first time in a while that Pike, you've been able to sleep without your armor on, and it's so nice.
Laura: That's great.
Matt: You sleep hard, you sleep for an extended period, eventually you all begin to rouse, as you all wake up, the smell of fresh breakfast food is already coming to--
Laura: That and Pike's stank from her armor.
Matt: Yeah, you're going to have to wash that armor, girl.
Travis: It's like when you take a cast off, you're like, ugh.
Matt: It's bad.
Marisha: Actually, is there a bath house in the village?
Matt: You haven't inquired. You could ask around if you want.
Marisha: We should have a girls' day at the bath house.
Orion: I woke up and took a dirt bath.
Liam: You're not a rat, though.
Matt: Yeah. Oh, but he didn't transform you, though.
Orion: Huh?
Matt: He didn't transform you.
Orion: I know, in lizard form.
Sam: Gross.
Orion: In my form.
Taliesin: That's awesome.
Orion: Scales, you rub it off with clay?
Matt: Yeah, there you go. Out in the front of the Keep.
Laura: Gross!
Orion: I have a little dirt in my room.
Laura: A little pile of grossness.
Liam: We just don't fear for our lives for the first time.
Sam: Let's go down and have our meeting.
Matt: So you guys head down into the dining room again, Kima's still standing there with the maul, left where she was. Grog is still face-down like on the table, grabbed the plate up against his face with mashed potatoes across his cheek. Across the way at the far table, you see Cordell and Shayne are both finishing their breakfast, and are sitting there at the table with their arms kind of gathering as you enter. "Morning!" "Morning." And they both kind of finish their meal. Get up and stand up. "Enjoy your breakfast. You've earned it." "I think our shift is done." She pats Cordell and they both get up and they exit out.
Laura: Have a good night! I know, I know, but they're sleeping.
Travis: I start awake with food on my face and I wipe it off and eat it. "I had a horrible dream about two walking testicles that were hurting my mind."
Sam: That was no dream! (laughter)
Liam: I am so sad that you woke up. I was just about to go to the hearth and get some ash and draw a penis on your head.
Travis: I had a feeling something was coming.
Liam: Next thing out of my mouth, that's a promise.
Ashley: Where's the Bag of Holding?
Travis: I've got it.
Ashley: Can you check in your bag to see if the Horn is still there?
Laura: And it's okay?
Travis: I look in the bag of holding and I see a Horn?
Matt: You look in the bag and you see nothing. You imagine something, you reach in, you pull it out.
Taliesin: Don't do that.
Laura: How are we going to get it out of there?
Orion: I can.
Ashley: Can you tell if it's in there?
Sam: Can you teleport something out of a bag?
Orion: It's Telekinesis, I can picture it and--
Laura: Teleport it, can you pull it out and make sure it's still there and okay?
Matt: Okay. So you use Telekinesis, you lift the Horn out--
Orion: No, I don't do it. I'm assuming it's there. I'm not doing that right now.
Laura: Wait, no, check though, I want to make sure it's okay.
Orion: I'm pretty sure it's there.
Laura: But I want to make sure.
Sam: All right, I will check with Mage Hand or whatever, I got something else. Mage Hand, yeah, I'll Mage Hand it.
Matt: Mage Hand gently and slowly lifts it out, you can see the Horn kinda holds there for a second, it moves very slowly.
Travis: Yeah, put it back in.
Matt: Put it back in the bag.
Travis: Thank you, tie it up tight. I'm going to go down to the, what is it, the temple below the thingie?
Ashley: Okay, yeah, go down to the temple.
Travis: All right, I'm going to go play in the dark with myself. That sounded wrong.
Matt: Okay, so you head down into the temple to Sarenrae, which is beautiful, it's all like a giant two-story stained glass three-set walls with trees and hedges set up and flowers, bunch of wooden kind of long benches set up towards this, the altar in the center, it's beautiful, especially this time of day, it's close to noon right now so the sun's streaking through the top of it, and it's cascading through the tree boughs of the two trees that are closest to the entrance. It's a beautiful sight. Even you, Grog, are moved.
Travis: Just because I'm nervous, I reach into the Bag of Holding and pull out a vial of holy oil that I have. I have three vials of holy oil and I just hold it in one hand while I'm down there.
Matt: All right. So while he's down there, the rest of you guys, what're you doing?
Orion: I'm going to cast Circle of Teleportation in my room.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: No, I'm going to go to the treasury first, I'm going to take out 500 gold pieces, and then I'm going to go to my room and cast Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius is gone.
Sam: Let's heal Kima.
Laura: You just left us?
Orion: By the blessing of Bahamut, I choose Draconia.
Matt: Tiberius is gone.
Ashley: Okay, so, I'm going to stand behind Kima and--
Taliesin: We're going to face her towards the wall.
Ashley: Face her towards the wall.
Liam: Good idea.
Ashley: Or towards something happy.
Taliesin: We're ready to pull you away when she starts to move.
Ashley: Yeah, okay. So.
Marisha: Wait! Are we unfreezing her?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: No, I thought we were going to talk to Allura first.
Laura: No, we're going to talk to her first.
Marisha: Oh wait, that's right. And we were going to do that thing.
Laura: You were drunk, it's okay.
Marisha: That's right, I was probably tipsy, sorry. We came up with like eight plans last night.
Laura: You were so drunk.
Sam: Wait, shouldn't Grog be here, he's the one who likes her.
Travis: Oh, the things I sacrifice for the group.
Ashley: So I cast Greater Restoration on Kima.
Laura: And then run away!
Matt: Okay, you reach out and touch the back of Kima. Her stone armor turns to gold and rapidly her entire form goes back to flesh. As she finishes her swing with the maul (impact sound) against the stone wall. And she kinda steps back for a second, confused, and looks over her shoulder at the rest of you.
Sam: Everything's okay, everything's okay, we're out of danger, we're at home, it's okay.
Laura: It's fine, it's fine, guess what, we are alive.
Sam: We lived.
Matt: Just drops the maul for a second and kinda leans back against the wall.
Marisha: I just get the leftover mashed potatoes from breakfast.
Matt: "Thank you, thank you, oh thank you. What happened?" She's not even using utensils, she's just like scooping it with her hand at this point.
Laura: So we killed K'Varn, right?
Matt: "Obviously."
Sam: Funny story, you were right about Clarota. He was horrible, we killed him. We killed him! Hey, you were right.
Laura: But not before we were overrun with a bunch of evil brothers of his.
Taliesin: And we got a very fancy hat out of it.
Laura: Hey, right, look at his hat.
Sam: We should've known all along, you were right, we should've trusted you, sorry.
Matt: "It's all right. He had his uses, certainly."
Liam: You were right, we were wrong, you're very attractive, we're all quite ugly.
Matt: "That isn't necessary, but the compliment is appreciated, regardless. Thank you for bringing me back with you. You could have easily left me back and I appreciate that you took the time."
Sam: So, you're alive, that's good because you were sorta on a suicide mission.
Matt: "Not a suicide mission."
Laura: What exactly was your mission, Kima?
Matt: "Where's the Horn?"
Laura: Well, thing is, it's not here.
Matt: "All right. It's not with the illithid, is it?"
Sam: It's in a safe place.
Matt: "How safe?"
Laura: Pretty safe.
Taliesin: Why, what can it do?
Matt: She looks visually nervous and she goes--
Laura: Nothing can touch it.
Matt: "Well, that's what the Order that originally sealed it believes. Even if it's somewhere safe temporarily, we can possibly relocate it. But we have to-- (sighs)"
Liam: You saw your mission as a suicide mission, but if you had secured it, what were your plans? What was plan B? What were you going to do?
Matt: "Well, if I were to fall in the process of trying to get the Horn, others would come after me. I sent word to my Order that if I did not return they would send more."
Laura: Can I insight?
Matt: Go for it, yeah, go ahead and roll insight.
Laura: 19.
Sam: Ooh!
Marisha: Whisper time! Sweet, sweet whispers.
Sam: Keep subscribing, guys, because whispering action doesn't come free.
Marisha: How many subscribers away are we?
Lucas: 38.
Marisha: 38 subscribers.
Travis: That's a lot.
Marisha: That's a lot.
Sam: That's a lot.
Marisha: That is still a lot.
Sam: Keep subscribing to Geek and Sundry, where you can watch Matt Mercer whisper at people.
Matt: And she goes, "So this Horn, which is one of two, if Allura is correct, was sealed a thousand or so years ago by those who originally cut it from the head of the avatar of Orcus of which it was bestowed. They, once he was slain, did everything they could within their power to destroy it, yet this artifact, instilled with the purity of Orcus, was indestructible to their knowledge. So the least they could do was to seal both horns across the world from each other and forget that it even existed. Which worked well until recently. It wasn't until these visions came to me and other members of my Order that we knew that this, this was a thing, and me being the closest in my pilgrimage, we took that as time of the essence I was to go in there with a team and retrieve it. If it couldn't be destroyed, at the very least we could convene and decide a safer place to possibly reseal it and forget. There are magical ways of forcing those of us who know how to forget. That would be the safest thing for it. If there is a way to destroy it, we don't know, but that could also be sought after. We have arcane and divine knowledge we didn't have back then, so, in the long run it needs to be retrieved, the longer it stays down there in the Underdark, no matter where you placed it, it draws like a beacon all darkness to it until something else like this beholder K'Varn will take up the mantle and themselves be as dangerous or more so than he ever was."
Laura: So the other Horn is still safe?
Matt: "As far as I know. The visions only gave me access to where this one was. I can only assume that it's out there, but if someone else were to find it, I would know that they probably have knowledge of the second one existing, as well. I don't know if K'Varn shared this information, but if someone else takes the mantle of this Horn, what's to stop them from seeking the other?"
Liam: Bummer.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "Regardless, I appreciate that we're all alive and we're together, and where are we?"
Laura: Oh, you're in our home.
Sam: Greyskull Keep. It's in Emon.
Matt: "We're in Emon?"
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "Well, that's wondrous, we can speak with Allura. She would have the wisdom to know what to do with this next."
Sam: Hypothetical. What if an army of darkness was slowly approaching Emon to kill all of us?
Matt: "What are you saying?"
Sam: Well, we killed Clarota and K'Varn, but we, there was a lot of bad guys down there that we could not kill--
Laura: We hurt that Elder Brain real bad, but not bad enough.
Matt: "I don't know much about the illithid themselves, but they reside deep and they are not fans of the surface. I believe that it was K'Varn's initial onset that was pushing them, both in union with the duergar and pushing them towards the siege. They spoke of something about bringing twilight to the surface world. I don't know what that was about, but I fear what knowledge they have if left alone. At the very least, I know that they're probably having to return and lick their wounds where we left behind. It would be folly for them, especially knowing that we're aware, to attack now."
Laura: Okay, that's good.
Matt: "But we can notify those in Kraghammer to buffer their defenses, close the tunnels that you took down there and my army as well, and that should give us time to prepare if we choose to seize or at least seal them off."
Laura: And your Order is what?
Matt: "The Order of the Platinum Dragon."
Laura: Right. That's a really good Order, right?
Taliesin: History check, can I do a history check?
Matt: It's a religion check.
Taliesin: That's a religion check, not history check?
Marisha: Pike.
Matt: You could roll a history check and probably gain some knowledge based on that, but the--
Ashley: Could I do it?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Ashley: Are you doing a religion check, Percy?
Taliesin: I'm doing a history check, if you want to do a religion check.
Ashley: I'll do a religion check.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: 22.
Ashley: So fucking close.
Matt: I mean, you guys are familiar loosely with the name Bahamut, you've heard Tiberius bring it up before, you've seen temples to it, but your knowledge knows that Bahamut is very well regarded as the lawful good deity of justice and honor and is primarily one of the great good gods of this pantheon.
Taliesin: If we're going to trust anyone, I think this is a good--
Travis: Yeah, I feel pretty good about this.
Taliesin: I trust the organization, they have a sterling reputation.
Marisha: So, Kima. Pie-in-the-sky goal? You would destroy the Horn?
Matt: "If we had the means of doing so, yes. We'd have to talk to the Order, we'd have to talk to the Council, we'd have to bring people that we could trust and that had the capabilities of knowing if this were possible how we would go about it. It's beyond my knowledge."
Liam: I think what worries us is anyone coming in contact with it would be corrupted.
Matt: "Don't go into contact with it."
Laura: No.
Liam: No, of course.
Marisha: Just within range.
Sam: Yes, is proximity okay?
Matt: "I don't know, I saw it for as long as you did."
Laura: This could be bad.
Sam: Evil Grog?
Laura: Kind of uncomfortable.
Matt: "The essence of most artifacts like this, it goes more than just touch, one has to be imbued, bond with these artifacts, to attune with them like any powerful magical item to truly gain its power, but that's not to say that itself does not contain some sort of foul intelligence."
Ashley: Can I go downstairs and go get Grog?
Matt: Okay. So you walk your way down.
Travis: (sings) I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
Matt: As you're walking past, as you walk past you are immediately met in the hallway by Erwen, your servant, your halfling elder servant who walks up and says, "Dear, I wanted to let you know that a scroll came for you, some sort of a summons." And he hands it to you.
Ashley: Me?
Sam: Probably jury duty.
Matt: And he kinda walks past you in the tunnel.
Taliesin: Always the worst time.
Matt: You open it up a little bit, it's not, hasn't been opened, you kinda pull the paper and open it up. It's a summon to the Council of Tal'Dorei, it's written by the hand of the clerk, and it says, essentially, the sovereign Uriel has been notified of your arrival and would like to see you at the council chambers posthaste.
Ashley: Okay. I'm still going to go get Grog, but I'll pass the scroll around. Hey Grog, come upstairs.
Travis: Oh yeah?
Marisha: That was for all of us?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: It was addressed to Vox Machina.
Travis: Is it clear?
Ashley: Just don't say anything yet, but just come upstairs.
Travis: Did she ask about me?
Laura: She definitely did.
Ashley: She did, yeah.
Travis: With my bald head.
Matt: All right. You make your way back in, Kima finishes her meal, and you guys are chatting a bit, she's just like, "All right, if I may ask, how did you seal it? I feel uncomfortable knowing the process and that it's at least safe."
Marisha: Oh, we have one of the best defense mechanisms. Grog!
Travis: Hello, Lady Kima.
Laura: It's in a very secure magical item.
Matt: She glances at you and goes, "All right, very well. Just be mindful that you don't go reaching in there."
Marisha: I use my Druidcraft as he enters to make little sparkles and lightning bugs appear around him. "Grog!"
Matt: Lady Kima, who is currently covered in dirt and sweat, still in the golden armor that she wrestled from the long-dead corpse of a dwarf in the Underdark, her chin is smattered with dried mashed potatoes and a bit of her breakfast, kinda gives--
Laura: So she's covered in food as well.
Matt: (laughs) Gives you a look as you're walking in like. "It's good to see you alive, friend."
Travis: Yeah, more than alive, I think.
Ashley: And also, he actually pulled you out of the cavern with one arm while you were stone. Out of the whole place.
Travis: Oh, stop, I don't like to brag.
Matt: She stands up and kinda wipes the food off her chin, clutches her symbol, and then steps right before you, looking up towards your face and says, "I thank you, friend Grog."
Laura: Friendzoned!
Matt: And then reaches out and gives you a big hug.
Liam: Plus he decided not to put you in the magical bag when you were a statue.
Matt: She releases Grog slightly, and kinda gives you a keen look and goes, "Also appreciated."
Travis: Yeah, well, you know.
Laura: Oh my god, thank god.
Sam: Why don't you go rest? We'll summon Allura and we'll continue the conversation from there, I guess.
Matt: "Please, I'd love to see her, it's been too long. All right, I'm going to, is there a room I could rest?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: You could use my room.
Taliesin: There's a guest room.
Laura: Yes, we have a guest room.
Sam: We should use it.
Orion: I would've had your back, by the way, there.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: Erwen, who's by the door, leads her to the guest room and you guys take a moment to rest. We'll go ahead and pick up next session at that point, where Allura's being brought in, so we'll stop the game there as I have to rush to the airport, but before that we have some gifts to open from you guys.
Travis: You're rushing to the airport tonight?
Matt: Huh?
Travis: You're rushing to the airport tonight?
Matt: Yeah, I got a redeye, 1AM. To be in Sandusky, Ohio. At Collisi--er no, Collosalcon. Please come.
Travis: You're going to do the waterslides, right? You won't ride waterslides?
Matt: It'll be fun. Guys, thank you so much for watching, that was a lot of fun.
Sam: We lived!
Matt: And everyone lived! Barely.
Marisha: We lived!
Matt: Barely, oh my god.
Marisha: Holy shit, we lived.
Travis: One roll away from her being--
Ashley: That was rough.
Matt: Her and Scanlan.
Laura: One point, twice.
Matt: Twice for you.
Travis: Twice.
Taliesin: I'm going to go get our d20s back.
Marisha: Crazyballs. Oh yeah. We had two sparkles and a green one.
Ashley: I was just rolling bad.
Zac: Hey, guys. We got some gifts for you from the chatroom. Some letters.
Liam: I got an Asus computer with an "aren't we clever" sticker on it?
Marisha: Sweet.
Zac: Man, I'll give you an "aren't we clever" sticker if you want, it's worth about the same. We also have some donations to read off. (cheering)
Zac: So guys, as long as we're live, that subscriber giveaway still stands.
Laura: How far away are we from it?
Zac: 36 subs away from another giveaway. All right.
Matt: All right.
Zac: If you want to go ahead and, actually I don't know if she wanted this to be read. Oh, okay, but this is cool. Do you want to hand me those disposable cameras? Where did he go? Oh, I lost him.
Matt: Essentially it says, "Vox Machina, I have sent you a disposable camera. Basically I had this idea to send this to you and have you guys go crazy, fill up the camera with random shenanigans, whether it's behind-the-scenes, setup during a stream, or elsewise of your shoes, and then once you guys have filled both cameras, you can send them back with the already printed label included in the box I sent this in, send it back to me, I can get the pictures printed and doubled and then send you guys a set back once they're developed."
Marisha: Aw, that's a good idea!
Matt: "I thought it'd be something different for you guys to do, hopefully you enjoy it and I can't wait to hear back from you. Becca."
Marisha: That's fun!
Matt: Thank you so much, Becca.
Marisha: Awesome.
Ashley: Thank you, Becca.
Matt: Yeah, we'll keep the rest to ourselves. We've got an awesome picture of Grog and Mustang Scanlan. Look at that.
Taliesin: (sings) Mustang Scanlan.
Travis: Horse head. Evil horse head of doom.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: (sing) Slow your mustang down.
Marisha: (sing) Slow your mustang down.
Matt: All right, here we go.
Zac: All right, so let's get through these messages here.
Matt: All right, let's get this going, because I've got to get running soon.
Laura: All right.

Zac: Oh, Minecraft server.
Matt: Minecraft server surprise for you. "Come to these coordinates--" We have the coordinates here. "--and you will find your temple."
Zac: Somebody should probably write this down.
Matt: "1350 by 1350 z."
Zac: 1350 x.
Matt: "1350 x by 1350 z and you will find your temple of Sarenrae."

Matt: "By the way, Matt, when I get my copy of Arkham Knight, is it possible to get it sent somewhere for an autograph?" Send it to this studio with return post, we're happy to do that. That's fine. As long as it's sent with return postage already paid, I'll be happy to sit here one of these days.
Laura: That's an important thing, return postage.

Matt: Yeah, you should. All right. Rona Konandario. "A friend showed me Critical Role a few weeks ago, just as our long-time group of friends started our game. It must've been destiny.

Laura: This is for me?
Matt: That is for you.
Laura: Holy crap!
Sam: Wait, Laura, what did you get?
Matt: Oh my god, you got Jonathan Frakes signed?
Sam: Is he a fan of the show?

Laura: Oh my gosh. You'll always be my Number One.
Zac: This is for you to give to--
Laura: This is from Team Wishlist. Thank you so much!
Liam: This is a magic carpet for the group.
Marisha: Look at that shit, he's got a magic carpet!
Sam: On camera, on camera.
Liam: Thank you, Kat! Thank you Katkitten112 for this craziness, oh my god!
Matt: That's amazing.
Taliesin: That is so badass.
Matt: I'm going to say that's the keen dagger.
Laura: Look at how many daggers he has now! Ludicrous.
Liam: Just ten more.
Marisha: So many daggers.
Matt: All righty, guys, so. As a heads-up. "Attn Geek and Sundry Twitch. To the awesome people at Geek and Sundry, please forward this package to the members of Critical Role on my behalf. I have made them each a personalized pendant with their character names, plus a few extras. Earrings inspired by Keyleth, Pike, and Vex'ahlia for Marisha, Ashley, and Laura, and four Vox Machina pendants which can be kept or given away. Many thanks to all involved for making Critical Role possible. Those short videos of their campaign on Vine were never enough to know what was going on. Sincerely yours, Ipec Psy." That's so awesome. Thank you so much, Ipec. Okay, pass this down to Percy?
Orion: I got this amazing Tiberius pin.
Laura: So cute!
Taliesin: So fantastic.
Zac: Tiberius.
Laura: Oh, it's got a little deck.
Orion: Pike. Ashley. A three-inch figure of Pike is coming for you and a three-inch figure of Scanlan is coming. They're on their way.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous!
Orion: David.
Matt: It's your holy symbol.
Marisha: They're little flowers!
Zac: Hey, guys, we have some boxes of very special dice here, and they included a letter, but it says, "Please do not read on stream," so this is for you guys to read when we go offline, but we're going to hand these out as well.
Marisha: Holy crap.
Laura: Oh, this is for me!
Marisha: I'm pretty sure she has an Etsy store.
Taliesin: She does.
Laura: Oh my god, this is the best day ever.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous!
Liam: It's Critmas!
All: Critmas!
Liam: Whoa, look at that. That's a die, it's dangerous.
Travis: No it's not.
Matt: That's so cool, you guys are ridiculous.
Sam: Whoa, that's an awesome die!
Travis: Are you fucking kidding me?
Sam: Whoa, the first roll was a 20! (cheering)
Laura: This will never go in the dice graveyard.
Zac: Each one is unique to you guys, it's nuts.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Travis: Skulls!
Ashley: What? I got a Celtic knot!
Laura: This is the coolest thing ever.
Taliesin: Holy shit.
Marisha: What does yours look like?
Taliesin: Holy shit.
Laura: Let me see!
Ashley: Nice, what the heck!
Travis: It's made of skulls.
Laura: Wow, I got a 20!
Marisha: Whoa, with the whitewash on it.
Zac: Okay, wait.
Taliesin: I just rolled a 20! Look at it, look at it!
Marisha: Wait, did everyone roll 20s on their first roll?
Matt: These are magically enchanted handcrafted dice.
Travis: I rolled an eight.
Marisha: I rolled a four.
Matt: I got a Sputnik dice, by the way.
Ashley: Thank you so much!
Taliesin: Thank you so much!
Marisha: These are crazy! Holy balls!
Sam: Okay, a benefactor sent the holy charm of Sarenrae for me to present to you.
Marisha: Oh my gosh, that's so pretty!
Sam: In, I think, holy matrimony?
Ashley: Oh, well, let's just--
Matt: Ellie, these are all amazing. Thank you so much.
Laura: Thank you, thank you.
Ashley: Thank you, thank you.
Orion: A dragon-bone die for the dragonborn.
Matt: I've rolled nothing lower than a 16 on this die, so it gets used a lot moving forward.
Liam: Also, for my birthday I got (Gollum voice) precious.
Marisha: That's awesome!
Orion: Good job, guys.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous.
Zac: You guys are all going to post pictures to Twitter, right, because everyone's asking.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, this is happening.
Liam: (Gollum voice) Precious!
Zac: While these guys are still opening their presents, I wanted to-- go ahead.
Marisha: Ellie, whoever made the jewelry, to tweet at us and let us know her Etsy store.
Matt: Ellie did the dice, wasn't it, I think?
Marisha: Ellie did the dice.
Matt: Yeah, the pendants were--
Zac: Ellie did the dice.
Marisha: The pendants were from Ipec.
Laura: Oh, I've got to get all my presents in the picture.
Marisha: From @millena, let us know about your Etsy.
Ashley: Guys, thanks so much.
Matt: An awesome letter from Meghan Levann, cards from Meghan Levann's site, we're going to go ahead and pass these out, and I'll read this after the stream. That's so awesome, thank you so much, Meghan.
All: Thank you, Meghan!
Zac: While these guys are still going through their presents, I just want to remind you guys, thank you for tuning in, and tomorrow we have So You Don't Have To, and we're going to play Jazz Punk on the stream, and it's a lot of fun, and then after that we'll have Gather Your Party and IndieKate is joining us, the all-female punk band Blood Candy is joining us, and then we have the-- oh my gosh, I feel like a dumb-dumb now. What's the name of that-- the Dance Free Movement people? The group that threw the party for the guy that was shamed on the internet, the--
Matt: Mercer shirt. Dice on the back. DM represent.
Zac: I'm sure a lot of you guys heard about the man that was shamed on the internet.
Marisha: Yeah, the punk teenagers made fun of him?
Zac: Right. Made fun of him on the internet, and a large group of-- the Dance Free Movement came Together, flew him out to Los Angeles, and threw a big party for him, so we have the Dance Free Together group coming tomorrow to play Just Dance with us, to talk about their movement and everything like that, so make sure you guys tune in tomorrow, it's going to be a lot of a fun, that's from 7-10PM. And we had a couple more donations really quickly come in. Just wanted to say thank you to--
Matt: What's that?
Lucas: Did you read the dice on the shirt?
Matt: (laughs) Nice and hidden. Didn't notice that. The dice say, 'How do you want to do this?'
Laura: Awesome!
Taliesin: That's so cool.
Laura: Oh, that's really cool.
Zac: For the people that donated after we started reading the donations, I know Matt's trying to get outta here pretty quick, so thank you, FoxyForsythe, Zopher, Metheram and Hunter, I'll make sure these guys get the messages that you guys sent, but we're going to go ahead and let these guys start packing up. I know that they have lives!
Marisha: We're tweeting pictures of our dice and our things so everyone can see now.
Laura: I'm hashtagging Critmas.
Zac: Did we make that sub goal?
Orion: Oh my god, is that your die that you got?
Zac: We did not make the sub goal, so we'll get you guys-- no, we're not going to get it, so we'll get you guys with a giveaway tomorrow.
Matt: Next time, you can do it then. You guys are ridiculous, thank you so much. Have a wonderful night.
Ashley: Thank you guys so, so much.
Matt: See you next week on Thursday.
Marisha: We love you guys, you're amazing! [dramatic music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, and good evening everyone, to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight's going to be an interesting evening based on how we left off last week, so we'll get to that here in a moment. First and foremost, let's get through our announcements. At the top, we are excited. This episode and the episodes of this month are brought to you by our new sponsor for this month, Loot Crate. (cheering)
Matt: Me and Marisha have been Loot Crate--
Marisha: --purveyors for like three years.
Matt: But they've been awesome enough and interested in helping us sponsor this next month of content, so that being the case, if we want to go ahead and open some of these boxes real fast, and see, so you're aware of the kind of stuff that Loot Crate does. While they're opening this, Loot Crate is a monthly subscription box service that's 20 bucks a month and you get six to eight unique items that are based on a specific theme every month.
Laura: Leeloo Dallas Multipass!
Taliesin: This is the one that comes with the Harry Potter socks.
Laura: Sorry, Matt, you were talking.
Matt: That's okay. You guys show off what you got.
Liam: I have a little cute facehugger for the face.
Marisha: Yes, a drinking horn!
Sam: I got a shofar! I'm still saying we should rename the show Crate-ical Role for this month. I'm just saying.
Matt: No, I'm good. I'm good on that, thank you.
Taliesin: This fabulous Labyrinth t-shirt, which Travis is sporting.
Travis: I think if David Bowie can't keep you alive, I don't know what can. Original War of the Worlds and The Day the Earth Stood Still prints?
Matt: So, the cool thing about this is, they send you a new crate every month that has a certain theme and the content in that is based around that theme. If you go to www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole, you can enter the code 'criticalrole', one word, to save $3 on your new subscription, so if you're thinking about it and you want to try it out for a little while, go ahead and use our code and get yourself a nice little discount, which is rad.
Liam: The other neat thing about Loot Crate boxes is you can turn them inside out and they become something. This one's an arcade machine.
Marisha: This one's got a maze on the inside.
Taliesin: I keep all my stuff in these boxes.
Marisha: Yeah, they're good storage boxes. Or regifting boxes.
Matt: That the invasion box?
Travis: Yeah. There's an invasion box, a quest box, and a power box, but we don't have that yet.
Matt: Not yet, power box, I think, is this month.
Ashley: There's so much X-Files stuff in here. This is awesome.
Matt: (laughs) That was a good month.
Laura: I think May is World of Warcraft, DBZ. It's got all these amazing things and I was like, I'm a part of all of these things and I want it!
Matt: I like how it's essentially a really tiny pre-stream Critmas.
Sam: Guys, you could watch us open stuff all night.
Matt: I've already lost control of the episode.
Travis: Go to Loot Crate, click the link. Show some love.
Matt: So, yeah, lootcrate.com/criticalrole. You can put in 'criticalrole' as your code there and you'll get 3% off your subscription.
Marisha: $3 off.
Matt: Or yeah, sorry, $3, not 3%. Much better than 3%. I'm so stupid. $3. It's awesome. Thank you, Loot Crate! Next announcement we have, for those who missed it previously, it is now available: the latest issue of Rat Queens, in which Vox Machina make a cameo appearance during a certain bar-crawl portion of the issue. And some wayward bard ends up trying to buy a drink for one of the members.
Travis: He's got glorious hair, though.
Matt: He has glorious hair, which, mine is shorter now, but it'll grow. Don't worry, those of you who freaked out. I've already gotten people who're like, "You cut it!" and I'm like, "It's hair! I live in the Valley where it's hot."
Laura: Well, it's not really hot right now.
Matt: Yeah, not today. Today, the weather's been nice. So, yeah, next up on the list, Taliesin. Supposedly, for those who haven't seen it, the next run on Signal Boost, the show that Marisha writes and produces for, has a new person hosting the next series of episodes.
Taliesin: Who's hosting the new series-- Oh, fuck. I'd better start working on that right now. Oh. It's going to be great. No, I'm having a lot of fun. We're putting it together, and--
Marisha: It's going to be weird. We're going even weirder. So for everyone who already hates how weird it is, buckle up.
Matt: All right, so, look for that. All right. Also, there is a new series of Geek and Sundry website content coming up called Ask Vox Machina, in which Vox Machina members have been written to by various people living in the world of Tal'Dorei, asking how to solve their problems. Our wondrous players here are answering them in character. I believe the first one is going to be Sam, right?
Sam: Yeah, Scanlan got some great letters from the fans, and he replied with some award-winning advice. So, check that out tomorrow on geekandsundry.com.
Taliesin: Participation awards all around.
Matt: (laughs) Did you say anticipation awards?
Taliesin: Participation.
Matt: Oh, I like anticipation awards, too. There's a video game that some people may have heard of called Uncharted 4 that's coming out. Reviews have been coming out and everyone's giving it the best game of forever.
Laura: It's amazing!
Matt: So, and I believe one of our own Vox Machina plays a rather awesome role in that, Laura? (cheering)
Matt: Nadine Ross in the story.
Laura: Yeah, she's a villain, so you get to face off with her. It's really fun.
Matt: That is exciting.
Liam: You are a good actor.
Matt: And in the multiplayer you might hear me try and kill you a couple times.
Liam: Yeah, kill him a lot for what he's about to do!
Sam: You also might hear me try to heal you a couple times.
Matt: Okay, so between us, we got you.
Laura: That's right, I remember when we were going in for multiplayer, it was like, we've got several members of Vox Machina as the multiplayer characters, which is pretty ridiculous.
Matt: Should be fun. All right. Also, we put the new full title intro on Facebook yesterday, so you guys can get it in hi-def glory at your request. And we've already hit a million views on it in a day.
Travis: (laughs) Which is weird.
Liam: Dungeons and Dragons!
Matt: It's a good time when you can dress up as your D&D characters for a weekend and people on Facebook are like, cool. Like, that's the weirdest thing ever.
Taliesin: A million people go, huh.
Matt: Huh. That's a thing. (laughs)
Laura: Although I did get made fun of already.
Matt: Did you?
Laura: Some fan pointed out that I looked stupid.
Matt: Did they really?
Sam: I wouldn't call that person a fan, necessarily.
Matt: They say that (funny voice) I love the intro but Laura Bailey looks stupid.
Laura: (fake cries)
Sam: I'm sorry I wrote that.
Laura: It was Sam.
Matt: All right, last couple things here. The title song actually for that intro, written by our wondrous friend of the show, Jason Charles Miller, who you saw play as Garthok, the half-orc rogue a number of episodes back, who wrote our original theme and the new one, has it up on iTunes. So if you want to have the most badass, nerdy ringtone and/or music to play on repeat until you start bleeding out of your nose, that is now available on iTunes, so you can search for the Critical Role intro music. It's awesome. All right, Liam, you want to take it away?
Liam: We've come a long way to get here tonight. It's true we may die, and when our bones are turned to dust, carry them away in Wyrmwood gaming boxes, the finest wooden boxes for carrying the remains of the dead ever. They're great! Oh and you can put dice in 'em too, which is probably their intended purpose. And if you like them, they have many different kinds of woods, you go to wyrmwoodgaming.com. And if you want to pay for shipping, you can, but if you don't want to pay for shipping, use the code 'critrole'.
All: Critrole!
Liam: Feels so good. And you'll get free shipping. And then also, lastly, this is the last couple of hours for their kickstarter for the sentinel box. You can get our logo onto any box, like this, or you can get the real swag and get the master box. It looks like this on any wood. And you put your dice in it, cards in it.
Ashley: My favorite part of Wyrmwood Gaming is the magnets. Magnets, bitch! (laughter)
Matt: It's so satisfying.
Liam: So, that kickstarter, a couple more hours, then finito if you want to get in on that. Okay.
Matt: Cool. And last but not least on my list, it says 'death to all puppies'. I don't know who wrote that.
Travis: Who would write that?
Laura: It was you, Matt. It was you!
Matt: I'm going to assume it's Sam. It's usually Sam. All right. Well, then, let's go ahead and bring this down now to get in the mood for tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. So! Leaving off from last week's episode, the party of intrepid adventurers, Vox Machina, trying to save the whole of Tal'Dorei from the Chroma Conclave, a collection of chromatic dragons that have destroyed many of the main cities here, have gone about searching for items called the Vestiges of Divergence, magical artifacts from a war of ancient times that apparently hold some great power that could aid in defeating these dragons. One of which, apparently, is being held by Kevdak, the leader of the herd of roaming tribal barbaric individuals that Grog once belonged to, and had beaten the crap out of and left Grog for dead long ago. While the dragons had destroyed part of Westruun and left it behind, this tribe utilized that time to take over the town, enslaving or keeping most of the people under their thumb, and making an accord with the one black dragon, Umbrasyl, that is currently in a tenuous relationship right now with these herd members, Herd of the Storm, as they're known. You, having sent a few of them to their death via a trap on the outside, found your way into the city, saved some of the individuals that lived there, as well as Kaylie and Dr. Dranzel, and Grog went ahead and issued a challenge to the Herd to meet with Kevdak himself. After some fairly decent intimidation checks, it was agreed, and while most of the party stealthed behind, you made your way to the very center of the town square, where Kevdak leapt off the top of the ex-Margrave's homestead and the two of you began to do battle in a pit of spikes that was gathered in the center of the town square, surrounded by a number of the clan watching on. During this fight, it went back and forth a bit before Grog felt that this was a losing battle should it continue in this way and decided to, at least it seemed to me, call out to his friends for aid with the classic Shakespearean battle cry of, "Vox Machina, fuck shit up!"
Liam: That's from Coriolanus.
Matt: Oh, sorry, Coriolanus, thank you. And that is where we're picking up. So--
Sam: Before we go, I have to inspire everyone with this. (laughter)
Matt: Holy shit. What the-- what?
Taliesin: What are you? What the fuck are you? Oh my God!
Liam: I want a d10!
Sam: And look, Ashley's, like, somewhere, I can't even see.
Matt: Please tell me that was a gift from somebody.
Sam: No, I made this myself, because I wanted you all to know how passionate I was about tonight.
Liam: Sam? Could you kiss your right gun?
Ashley: Kiss it! Kiss it!
Sam: Mm. Tastes like strawberries. And sweat.
Matt: Inspiration granted and immediately taken away.
Travis: Do your pants also have photoshopped lightning coming out of the crotch?
Sam: No, my pants are just jeans.
Ashley: Wait, how far down does it go?
Sam: All the way, baby.
Matt: That's the first step of the process. The pants come soon.
Laura: Did you just do that at home with a--?
Sam: Yeah, I just penciled it in.
Matt: I can't even. That's a thing. All righty, so, with that, we are going into the realm of battle. Let's go ahead and kick on the proper music for this. So, with Vox Machina currently on the rooftops here and hiding within the bottom of this building, we have the four archers that have appeared on the rooftop of the Margrave's house. We have most of the individuals that are surrounding this, along with the few innocents, which just for the sake of appearance, here, I will go ahead and attempt to mark with a few markers so you know who you're looking for, innocents-wise.
Liam: We're the innocents, Matt. We're the innocents.
Matt: No, you're not. Not anymore. All right, so, the red markers are going to act as markers for the innocent, just so you're aware.
Travis: Percy. Percy! Taliesin! You're on that roof, right?
Matt: Percy's over there. All righty, so, that all being the case, guys, as Grog shouted, at this moment the individuals in the center of the square start looking around, confused, not knowing where to come from. At this moment, a few of them manage to catch up a glance at the individuals that are on the rooftops. I need everyone to roll initiative, along with you, Grog, because combat has begun again at this point at the top.
Marisha: Wait, all of us?
Matt: All of you guys. This has started.
Taliesin: I mean, that's not amazing. That's better. 14.
Marisha: You're still ahead of me. You rolled a nat 20?
Ashley: Why's he laughing?
Travis: Because he's fucking evil.
Matt: 'Because he's fucking evil'? Is that what you said?
Travis: Who said that? I will beat him with my fists.
Matt: All right, so, for the sake of this one, we have 25 to 20.
Laura: 27.
Liam: 24.
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21, okay, so we have-- let's see.
Liam: All the people who wanted to go first are going first.
Matt: All right, 20 to 15?
Travis: 18.
Matt: All righty. 15 to ten.
Taliesin: 14.
Marisha: 13.
Ashley: 12.
Matt: Pike, getting into the double-digits!
Ashley: Oh, you know. Moving on up.
Taliesin: I'd rather have my low roll here than for anything else.
Laura: Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.
Travis: It's like a roller coaster. We're just going tick-tick-tick-tick-shooom.
Matt: A lot here I'm keeping track of, guys. All right, so, the surprise round affects all the archers. It affects everyone except for these four individuals, or these two individuals with the clubs, and these two women here with big swords, and Kevdak. So, top of the round, Vex.
Laura: Does the second story of the house that I'm in have windows? Can I see?
Matt: The second story does.
Laura: Can I run up the stairs, then, so I can get a better look at the playing field?
Matt: Actually, this one was supposed to go this way for the entrance point there. All right. So you are currently now looking out the side of the window.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to-- I'm already hiding, right?
Matt: Right, no one's seen you at this point.
Laura: Okay, then I'm going to Hunter's Mark Kevdak. And I'm going to hold my turn--
Matt: Putting a green on him for the Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I'm going to hold my turn until it seems like he's better incapacitated or until something happens. I'm going to hold my turn.
Matt: Hold your action until--?
Laura: I think until Scanlan goes.
Matt: Okay, so that finishes your turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Am I at a window as well, downstairs?
Matt: You are by a door.
Liam: Am I half on a street? In a door?
Matt: You're inside the house right now. The door is technically partially ajar because you guys did slip in.
Liam: All right, I'm going to click my boots, crack the door a few inches, and I'm going to hold my turn until one of our magic-users pulls a trick or Kevdak takes a swing at Grog.
Matt: Okay. That'll end your current actions. The archers are surprised. They do not go. It is Kevdak's turn. Kevdak sees you shouting out. He rolled a natural 20 on his initiative.
Laura: No, he didn't! That's why you shook your fucking head.
Matt: Yeah. I was like, man, all right. Let's start this right.
Marisha: Fucking Wheaton!
Matt: They had Wheaton come in and touch all my stuff. All right, so he's going to go ahead and, seeing you shout like this, he looks about for a second. He's going to continue his rage. He glances about, looks over and he sees nothing immediately on the rooftops, but looks down at this individual now shouting out for help before him, prostrate, and he gives you a glance and says, "Well this seems real familiar, doesn't it, Strongjaw?" At which point he's going to go ahead and take two of his reckless attacks against you. That's going to be a 28 to hit.
Travis: I'll have to look, but I think it hits.
Matt: Yeah. Second attack is a 30 to hit.
Travis: These aren't Great Weapon Master, right?
Matt: No, these are not Great Weapon Master.
Laura: What is his attack fucking bonus?
Taliesin: At least ten.
Matt: You take 30 points of slashing damage, reduced to 15. And two points of necrotic damage, because it's not reduced. And second one's going to be 22 points of slashing damage, reduced to 11, and then five points of necrotic on top of that.
Sam: However, for the second slash, I'm going to use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.
Travis: Before he does that, you said 17 on the first one, 11 on the second attack, and how much necrotic on the second one?
Laura: Seven overall. Plus two necrotic on the first hit. Five necrotic on the second.
Matt: You might have to get a little bit closer to make sure that he can hear you.
Laura: Plus that would be giving away your hiding.
Matt: What're you going to do, Sam?
Sam: I step forward closer to him and I use Cutting Words.
Matt: Okay, you step to the very edge of the rooftop here.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of this, right there.
Sam: And I shout, oi, Kevdak! I have a message from the people of Westruun! And I moon him. (laughter)
Sam: And I say, kiss our metaphorical hairy arses!
Matt: Just like that on your shirt. As he brings around his axe for a second swing, he hears that and glances over his shoulder and sees this shiny gnome butt up on the top. Continuing the swing, though, to attack. Go ahead and reduce the damage using your Cutting Words.
Sam: Ten, right?
Matt: Uh-huh.
Sam: Pff. One.
Matt: So you take ten points of slashing damage from that strike. Oh, you're wielding Mythcarver, so his next saving throw is at disadvantage, right?
Sam: Yes, it is.
Matt: Because you're not currently wielding your weapon, Kevdak's going to go ahead and take a step back and glance over at you, as he's going to move his fingers up and point towards the roof. And you see a bunch of the other entities and archers, whoosh, shift their attention over in your direction, Sam. All right, that finishes Kevdak's turn. Scanlan, you're up next. Actually, you do get an attack of opportunity on him with your fist. Because you're not holding your warhammer right now.
Travis: I rolled a five, plus what? My strength?
Matt: I mean, it's your strength modifier plus your proficiency modifier.
Travis: 13?
Matt: 13, no. You punch his back and it just hits off his muscle. All right. Sam, you're up.
Sam: Okay. From my crouched, butt-out position, whilst holding my Hand Cone of Clarity.
Matt: Where are you holding it?
Sam: It's shoved up there.
Liam: Between the legs, upside-down.
Sam: Before I make this attack, when I scanned around, did I see any of his allies without any weapons or carrying a staff or something like that?
Matt: No, they're all the type of people that would be at all times wielding something at their side. There are two individuals that you do notice, there is this one here, and there is Greenbeard right there, and they both appear to have some sort of a quarterstaff-type implement, but everything else is either bladed or giant clubs or some sort of big melee weapon.
Sam: But they're surprised anyway.
Matt: They are, yes.
Sam: Okay. Okay. Well, then, I will cast Hold Person at level three on Kevdak.
Matt: On Kevdak.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Oh boy.
Sam: At level three, so I get to target one other individual.
Matt: You would, yeah.
Sam: And I would target the beardy guy with the staff.
Matt: All right, Hold Person. For a minute, wisdom saving throw, for the duration. Okay.
Sam: Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage.
Matt: With disadvantage, yes, that is true. Kevdak. All right.
Sam: Because of Cutting Words.
Matt: He rolled a 19 and an eight. Taking the eight, that brings it to a ten, so that's a failure on him. (cheering)
Laura: For Hold Person, does it un-paralyze him if we hit him?
Sam: No. He's just paralyzed. You can have at him. And can I still move and do other things?
Matt: You can in a moment. We have to figure out if the other guy makes his save. He rolls a natural one.
Laura: Yay!
Matt: Aw, man, the rest of these people are going to be real pissed.
Liam: This is where my held turn comes in.
Laura: Me too, but I was in front of you.
Liam: Yeah, go for it.
Travis: If you hit him, does he become not paralyzed?
Liam: No, he's stuck.
Matt: Yes. At the end of each of his turns, the target can make another wisdom saving throw. And paralyzed, for those who are aware what paralyzation does, a paralyzed creature is incapacitated and cannot speak, automatically fails strength and dexterity saving throws, attacks rolls have advantage, and any attack that hits the target is a critical hit if it's within five feet of the creature.
Laura: Oh, five feet. Damn it. Oh, but that's good for Grog. Okay.
Sam: Okay, wait. I still get my move, right?
Matt: You do.
Sam: Okay. Is there any cover? Are there chimneys? Is there anything I can duck behind?
Matt: You can duck behind the other side of this roof if you'd like.
Sam: And still maintain sight? Oh, wait, no, I'd be more than 60 feet away.
Matt: I mean, it's more the casting time. You can still move away once you've cast the spell and hold it there.
Sam: Okay. Then I'll duck back behind some cover. And as my bonus, I still get a bonus, I will inspire Grog and I'll say, Grog! Now it's your turn to fuck shit up. (laughter)
Sam: All right.
Matt: And that finishes your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: Yeah, that's it.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: He's paralyzed.
Matt: You watch as he steps away from you, points up, and all the archers turn towards that, everyone else looks over at the rooftop and you hear a cacophony of voices around growling, before Kevdak takes another step and (grunts). And you see the gleaming ass of Scanlan in the distance, the high noonday sun bouncing off of his pale, sun-dappled, gnomish skin. These two round globes of victory staring down from the rooftop.
Sam: Round globes of victory! I love it.
Travis: Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak?
Matt: Do you want to pick up your weapon first, or?
Travis: No.
Matt: Nope? Okay.
Liam: Do the twins go first or does Grog go first?
Matt: Oh right, because you held your actions, so, up to you.
Sam: Okay, do your thing, do your thing.
Liam: I'm going to go.
Laura: I'm going to go.
Matt: Yep. All right. So. We have now Vex, taking your shots.
Laura: Yes. Yes. I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. So that's three attacks on the first attack.
Matt: Yes, and they all have advantage because he's paralyzed. This is bad for Kevdak, but we'll see how it works.
Laura: Okay, so.
Matt: Still raging, so everything's half-damage.
Laura: So 19 plus 12 probably hits on the first attack.
Matt: Yeah, that does.
Laura: Okay. 19 plus 12 hits on the second.
Matt: Yep.
Laura: And 17 plus 12 hits on the third?
Matt: Yeah, they all hit.
Laura: Okay. I'm adjusting my glasses, I'm so nervous. Okay. 28 on the first hit.
Matt: 28, reduced to 14, okay.
Laura: 21 on the second hit.
Ashley: Get him, baby.
Laura: 16 on the third hit.
Matt: Okay, that reduces to eight. All the arrows strike true, thump-thump-thump, but still each one is only piercing the flesh so far, he's generally so dense in his musculature, each impact is not having the same satisfying (impact) sound you're used to. But that ends your held action and it is now your turn.
Laura: Oh, but I get another attack, because that's just one attack.
Matt: Oh right, that was the sky sentinel, go for it. Take a second attack.
Laura: My second attack, I'm going to take at Greenbeard, and I'm going to shoot through the flaming bowstring.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 17 plus 12 probably hits? 17 plus 12?
Matt: Yeah, that's going to hit.
Laura: Okay. Gah! 14 on that one.
Matt: 14, okay. 14 damage to him. Greenbeard is currently stuck there in place, the arrow sinks into his robe and you don't even see the impact, it absorbs into the cloth and he goes, ah, and you hear the escaping air from the impact but he can't actually move.
Taliesin: Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I hunter's marked, he's hunter's marked already.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: At this point, you'd better.
Taliesin: We're not panicking, no, not at all.
Laura: Not at all. Hunter's Mark! I did it, I swear!
Matt: All right. You're up.
Liam: Just to verify, because Kevdak is still raging, am I denied the surprise attack from inside here?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay. So I'm going to use sharpshooter and drop five to hit harder, I'm going to throw a dagger at advantage, yeah?
Matt: So you're moving up into the doorway.
Liam: Yeah, to the doorway, right, so the first--
Matt: Who are you attacking?
Liam: Kevdak. 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet, you'd, okay, yeah, you can get right into there and probably still hit him from there. Because you have sharpshooter, you don't have the second increment range, go for it.
Liam: Okay, so it's 25.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Four, oh, hold on, I'll save that four. 20. Okay.
Travis: My hands are fucking shaking.
Liam: (counting) 31, 37.
Matt: 37. And half of that is going to put it at 18.
Liam: Okay. I'd like to use my bonus action to throw the next--
Matt: You had the held-- a held action is just your action.
Laura: Oh, yeah, you did the clicking the boots of haste already.
Liam: I thought that was a gimme-- oh, that's the bonus action?
Matt: Well, the idea being that when you hold your action, you have an action that you hold until it triggers. The bonus action's a whole different thing that you have to take on your turn.
Liam: So taking a hold is an action? I don't understand.
Sam: Holding your turn loses your bonus action.
Matt: Yes, essentially you have your action and your bonus action. Holding your action means you hold that one bit of it but your turn still continues past it.
Liam: Okay. Which doorway, where am I on the map, I can't see myself? Right there? Could I run to the corner of the building that the archers are on and scrabble up the side of it?
Matt: Over here?
Liam: And get to that archer?
Matt: You can certain try it. (laughter)
Matt: You rush past one of the peasants, fear in their face, they're confused and looking around and you see there's mud and a little trickle of blood that's dried down their face. As you (darting noise) by, they go, (gasps) You don't pay too much mind to them.
Liam: Acrobatics check?
Matt: Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30. You manage to make it up to the top.
Liam: Do I have an action left?
Matt: No, you used your action.
Liam: Action, action, bonus action with the hasted boots?
Matt: Technically, you wouldn't be able to move at this point even, but I'm letting you do that. Usually your move, it's a little weird.
Liam: Okay, so I'm outta gas.
Matt: So yeah.
Travis: This is the most epic map ever, by the way.
Matt: Trinket's just chilling in the house. (sad bear noise) All righty. So that ends your held action, now Grog, you're up.
Travis: Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak, please?
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Knowing that he pointed up with a hand at Scanlan's beautiful ass, hand still on his greataxe, paralyzed, can I try and rip-- continuing my rage because he hit me last round-- can I pull the axe from his hand?
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: He's going to fail this one.
Matt: With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: 27.
Matt: Oof! You yank the bloodaxe from his grip.
Sam: Yes!
Travis: Because I'm frenzied raging, do I have another move?
Matt: I mean--
Travis: Like, can I hit him with it?
Matt: Let's check on that, because I don't know if it's an attack-action-based, because you didn't take an attack action last turn, you used your action to pull it away. Looking at that right now, the berserker is here. Let me see.
Sam: Lots of rules tonight, guys. Upper-level rules.
Matt: Yeah, it's a bonus action, so you could if you wanted to. The weapon isn't attuned to you, so it would just act as a regular axe, possibly.
Ashley: Make it attuned to you!
Marisha: That's a short rest.
Travis: Can I, looking at the axe, say, oh, I do hope you have a necromancer in your group, because I'm looking at a fucking dead man. (laughter)
Travis: Can I aim right above the gauntlet below the elbow on his left arm? Swing to his side with the axe.
Matt: Like on his left arm? Sure. You're going to be-- it's going to-- okay, so you're raging. Advantage. Well no, reckless attack would be the advantage if you wanted to.
Travis: Well, he did it against me so I get it against him.
Matt: Well, you have advantage against attacks with him anyway, because he's paralyzed. I will say, it'll have-- okay, you'll have advantage on the attack, but I will say it's a general minus five to the attack, just because it's a very specific called shot. Go for it.
Marisha: Do it, do it.
Travis: Oh, that's much better. 20.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I don't know what the attack bonus is with the axe.
Matt: It's a d12, and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Okay. Where is it? Jesus.
Laura: That's it, that's it, that top one. That one. Yeah.
Matt: Poor d12.
Travis: This one? Plus what?
Matt: Strength modifier, which would be three.
Travis: Ah. So five.
Matt: Five. Whoosh, you hack the blade and it sinks quite a bit into the arm right above the elbow, you can see as you pull it out, a bit of bone is exposed from it, but the arm is still intact. It wasn't enough damage to go through, but he's like, (stifled yell)
Travis: And it hit him, right? So is it an automatic critical because it hit?
Matt: Because you were within five feet, so, yes. So double the dice. So what'd you roll on the dice?
Travis: So it was a two.
Matt: So four. So instead it would be seven damage. Still not enough. But you do do a significant amount of damage to his left arm. His now-open hand's gripping nothing. Actually the one hand was holding the axe and the other one was pointing up, so he's like, (strained sound) looking at you right now as the blood begins to seep out of the fresh wound on his left arm.
Travis: Do I have any of my movement left, can I move around behind him? 50.
Matt: You can move three more spaces, so yeah.
Travis: I'll either flank him or, yeah.
Matt: Three. That's where you can get, right there. Okay. That ends your turn. Surprise back, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: This'll be fun, we'll see what happens. All right, first thing I'm going to do is cast Hex on Kevdak, on the asshole, I'm going to Hex him.
Matt: (laughs) Cast Hex on the asshole.
Taliesin: So he is now enveloped in my dark smoke of death. He's also now at disadvantage on all strength checks.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: That's a thing.
Matt: That's the thing with Hex, all right. So yeah. You watch as Grog walks around him, Grog's shadow seems to stretch out from his form, reach up, and wrap itself around, almost merging with the tattoos across his torso. The actual bear tattoo almost seems to be almost covered with shadow.
Travis: I love you.
Taliesin: I know, I'm so happy. I'm going to take a little step back to get a slight bit of cover from those archers for when they start hearing the big bang-bangs coming from the house, to get half-cover, so I can still--
Matt: Which way are you going?
Taliesin: I'm going from my current vantage point, to about seven o'clock, eight o'clock.
Matt: About here?
Taliesin: Yeah, about there. For a little bit of cover from the arrows. And I can still see Kevdak.
Matt: Yes, you can.
Taliesin: So if I wanted to take my little pistol and start carving a little-- and I've got a nice little chunk of bone I can see in his arm-- can I take a sharpshooter disadvantage to hit that point?
Matt: You could. I'll move this board a little bit so you guys can see better.
Taliesin: So I'm going to shoot with sharpshooter specifically for his arm.
Matt: His left arm, you do not have a view on it right away.
Taliesin: Oh.
Matt: I would say from your perspective on the rooftop, because he was turned this way and is facing this way, you would have a big ol' view of his back and shoulders.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to take a shot for the elbow.
Matt: On this arm?
Taliesin: I'm going to try, yeah, on the visible elbow.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to sharpshooter through that shit, see what happens.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Okay. And I'm happy if you want to put any weird disadvantage--
Matt: You have advantage on the attack because he's paralyzed.
Taliesin: No, I don't, because I'm at distance. Or do I have advantage be--
Marisha: He's paralyzed.
Taliesin: Oh, he's paralyzed! I have advantage on the attack.
Matt: You have advantage on that, and then you have disadvantage because it's a called shot, plus minus five.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fine. But I get the bonus ten points still.
Matt: You would if you hit.
Taliesin: Okay. All right. That's fine. Natural 20.
All: Oh!
Travis: Oh my god, are you serious?
Marisha: Yeah, yeah.
Taliesin: Should've used the big gun, really. All right, that's okay. So that's, oh, hello baby, you're over here. Actually, I'm going to use the pink one--
Matt: What's the first range increment for the pistol?
Taliesin: 400 feet.
Matt: Yeah, okay.
Taliesin: I'm scary.
Matt: Gun. Go for it.
Taliesin: I know. Sorry. I know, I thought about that. Come on, baby, no whammies. Do I double the dice?
Matt: Double the dice and then add the modifier to it.
Taliesin: Okay, so that's 16, (counting), 32 points of damage for the first shot.
Matt: 32 points of damage? Okay, half of that into 16. (gunshot) You watch as the blast hits into the side of his arm. The arm actually hyperextends and part of the bone shoots out the side, and he goes and screams out. The arm does not, you know, it looks like it's in a rough place.
Taliesin: I'm shooting again. Same thing.
Laura: Oh my god, he's going to shoot his arm off.
Taliesin: 17, good enough. 17, I'm rolling good.
Matt: With the disadvantage?
Taliesin: No, it cancels out because he's-- it's no advantage, no disadvantage, right?
Matt: You got advantage because he's paralyzed, yeah. You're right, you're right. Hold Person, man. Nasty.
Taliesin: (counting) 25 to hit. That hits.
Sam: This is like 127 Hours, except with a gun.
Taliesin: That's the title of my, '127 Hours With a Gun'.
Liam: And remember, this is happening in about ten seconds.
Taliesin: I know. I actually, also, I rolled the wrong die, he didn't take nearly what, that's okay, so here.
Matt: Too late.
Taliesin: I know, too late. I know. I fucked that up.
Marisha: You rolled four, though.
Taliesin: Yeah, I know, so I did okay. Five, six, seven, eight-- (counting) 24 points of damage.
Matt: 24 points of damage. So minus that to 12, this is the same elbow?
Taliesin: Same elbow.
Matt: (gunshot) You see now, the arm actually is dangling now from some sort of sinew and bone that is barely keeping it on at this point.
Taliesin: Do you have a d6 that I can borrow? I'm going to go for my third, can I borrow your pink d6? I want to Bowie this shit. Yeah. I want to be flamboyant as fuck. All right. Going to call it. 14. (counting) 24 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Goodbye, elbow. Eh, well, not bad. (counting) 23 points of damage.
Matt: Lower that to 11. Okay. This shot hits the elbow again, actually destroying a big portion of the upper forearm. It's now essentially but a single leftover bicep muscle that's holding it in place as blood's pouring from the wound right now.
Liam: Who wants bacon?
Taliesin: All right. I'm calling it for now.
Matt: All right, that ends Percy's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to roll up this roof like a big, ominous fog cloud. And come up, and I want to do a Whirlwind on those two archers up there.
Matt: Up here? Are you coming from up here, you mean?
Marisha: Yup.
Matt: All righty. Let's take this here.
Marisha: So they must make a DC 13 strength saving throw.
Taliesin: I haven't burned any grit yet, I'm so excited.
Matt: Balancing here, there we go. A DC what? Oh no! Keyleth's dead.
Laura: No!
Ashley: No!
Taliesin: Ironically, crushed by a tree. Curse you, nature.
Matt: All right, what's the DC on that?
Marisha: The thing that she loved killed her. 13. Strength.
Matt: Strength?
Taliesin: Strength check or save?
Matt: This is a saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh, damn. Does he still have disadvantage?
Sam: Except she's not attacking him.
Matt: Okay, one of them fails, one of them succeeds.
Marisha: Okay, so the one that fails takes 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage, which is pretty good. 11, and he's flung 20 feet away. In a random direction.
Matt: In a random direction? All right. Let's go ahead and see what direction, that's a one, so he gets flung this way 20 feet?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Five, ten, 15, 20. (yells, impact). Falls prone there.
Marisha: He takes another 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every ten feet he was thrown.
Matt: Yes, that would be-- 2d6, that puts it at, I rolled double sixes on that, so that's 12 points of damage.
Travis: Yeah yeah!
Marisha: And he's knocked prone.
Matt: Yes he is.
Marisha: And the other guy--
Matt: (yells, impact), as this whirlwind of--
Laura: Ow ow ow ow.
Ashley: Ow ow ow ow.
Matt: Yeah, as you see, of the roof itself up there, portions of the rooftop are cracking off and spinning into the void of wind that Keyleth's currently creating within herself. Portions of the tree branches are swirling into it as various leaves and dead plant life that had been scattered around the roof are all filling this giant vortex that has appeared on the roof of the Margrave's house, tearing into both of the archers. One of them flung off, landing face-first, the other one--
Marisha: Takes half damage.
Matt: Takes half damage. Okay. All right. Five points of bludgeoning damage. All right. Does that finish your turn?
Marisha: Yup.
Matt: All right. Pike, you're up.
Sam: Yeah, Pike!
Ashley: Since I can't reach Kevdak, I'm going to send over a Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Range is 60 feet.
Matt: Spiritual Weapon. As a cleric. That's a level... two?
Ashley: I'm going to do it at a higher level, I'm going to do it at a level five.
Taliesin: Five? Five?
Ashley: It's a big one. (laughter)
Liam: In the shape of Madeline Kahn and it's out for blood.
Matt: We'll use this metal d20, where do you want to place it?
Ashley: Right above him.
Matt: We'll say in this central area there.
Ashley: It's, I don't even know, a big--
Matt: What weapon of Sarenrae's retribution would you want to summon in spiritual form upon Kevdak?
Sam: A beartrap!
Ashley: I just want it to be a big sword.
Matt: Okay, so a large greathand sword, almost a light reflection mirror-image of the Craven Edge that nearly tore the soul from your friend--
Travis: Yes!
Matt: You see a large light blade of Sarenrae's wrath emerges out of the stonework in the center of the square. Floats in the air for a second, and you want to go ahead and make that, and this is your bonus action--
Ashley: This is a bonus action, yeah.
Matt: If you want to use your action to cast a spell, you can't do higher than a level two right now. Because of the limitations on spells in our homebrew. However, do you want to have it attack Kevdak?
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll for the damage. With advantage.
Ashley: That would be a natural 20.
Laura: C'mon, Pike!
Ashley: All right, okay.
Marisha: We talked for a week!
Taliesin: Hundreds of text messages.
Matt: Wait 'til the surprise round's over.
Liam: You mean 30 seconds with the earring.
Matt: All right, so, you're looking at 4d8.
Ashley: Okay, I'm going to use Divine Strike to make it 5d8.
Matt: Well, that's only on your melee attack, it's not your actual spells.
Liam: It's all right, you're already a badass.
Matt: So roll 4d8, multiply that by two.
Sam: Multiply by two.
Matt: Critical hit.
Sam: Oh my god.
Ashley: What did you say?
Matt: You roll 4d8 times two.
Ashley: 22.
Matt: So 22 plus your wisdom modifier.
Ashley: Is 30.
Matt: So 30. Half that to 15.
Ashley: Aw.
Sam: Hey, that's good!
Matt: As the blade strikes down onto the now currently brutalized Kevdak who is still held in place angrily being whaled upon by the majority of you. So what else do you want to do this turn, if anything?
Laura: Oh yeah, you can still do other things!
Matt: You can move, you have an action.
Laura: This is a bonus!
Matt: It lasts for a minute, and it's not concentration.
Ashley: Yeah, I should probably, I should probably--
Matt: As a bonus action you can make it move and attack every round, so.
Ashley: Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to, would it be possible to get down on that bottom roof and hide?
Matt: Here?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: You could. Make an acrobatics check.
Taliesin: Clang clang clang.
Laura: You're going to roll, roll for it! I can't even read that. Oh.
Matt: What's the total?
Ashley: Five.
Matt: Fresh off the 20. Pike looks over the edge, leaps, hits a little bit to the side, her feet actually break-- from the weight of the armor and the angle you hit, break some of the shingles on the rooftop and you end up slipping onto your shield and you slide off the roof.
Laura: No!
Matt: And end up on the ground there.
Matt: You take seven points of damage from the fall, and you're knocked prone currently on the ground as you now see staring at you-- You're prone. A number of these angry Herd members that are all intent on murder at what's been happening.
Liam: I still think you're really cool.
Ashley: It's okay, I can run out of there with my Sprinter's Boots.
Matt: All right, Pike, that ends your turn. Now. I get to do some more stuff.
Taliesin: She's made of armor.
Sam: They're coming for you, Pike. You got a reaction or something?
Laura: Seriously. Pike, they're all coming for you.
Sam: Yeah. You're dead. Do you have a reaction of some sort? Do you have a reaction?
Marisha: Don't die, you are not dying tonight.
Ashley: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, we're going to be fine, we're going to be fine.
Taliesin: She's made of armor and they're people with sticks, with sharp sticks.
Sam: Oh my god, she's going to die.
Marisha: She's not going to die, she's not going to die.
Sam: Love of my life.
Taliesin: Not in one round.
Marisha: There's only one guy who ran up to her.
Laura: Scanlan, would it say 'reaction' here?
Sam: She knows what her reactions are. You do have one.
Matt: All right, so. Three of these individuals, some of which you may have passed in your time, and two of which you see are members that were absorbed into the tribe from what was previously the Rivermaw tribe, (roar) give off these angry roars and go into an immediate rage, breaking the surprise element, and charge. Three of them on you, one of them goes darting across the field right towards you, Pike. With that, these, pull out this sheet here, these Herd of the Storm warmongers are going to go apeshit on your ass. Grog, that's six attacks on you. Because of the flanking rules, that's going to put four of them at advantage.
Sam: Oh my god.
Matt: First one is going to be an 18 to hit?
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Misses. The first one goes and swings towards you, and you duck underneath it and whoomph, misses you by a mile. However, as that's happening, another blade comes the other direction, that's going to be a 25?
Travis: That hits.
Matt: Natural 20. Third one, so one hit. Second one's going to be a 28, so that's two hits and a critical. And then one that doesn't have advantage on you with both strikes is going to be 23, that hits, and a 16 that misses. So.
Sam: You do have inspiration.
Matt: Four hits and one crit.
Travis: I can't use it on this stuff, though. Only when I attack.
Matt: All righty. So, the four hits first. That's going to be 15 points of slashing damage.
Travis: Reduced to seven?
Matt: Reduced to seven. Right. Ooh, 19 points of slashing damage, reduced to eight.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: 13 points of slashing damage, reduced to six. And another 13, reduced to six. Now for the crit.
Taliesin: I would like to remind you that potions are a bonus action. Thank you.
Matt: (counting) That's going to be 22 points of slashing damage on that, reduced to 11.
Taliesin: Whew, you are a tank.
Laura: Unless he's unconscious.
Matt: Pike. So you're now surrounded on all sides, Kevdak's there before you, but you've now been completely swarmed in by three of these entities. Pike, this one rushes towards you, (battle-cry), this female half-elf, you can see a line of drool from her face with the sheer speed she was running and the froth that was forming at the corner of it. She leaps into the air, blade in front, and is going to come down on your tiny form. (counting) That's 28 to hit on the first one.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: And a 28. Rolled 18s on both advantage ones.
Ashley: Okay okay okay okay.
Matt: Right, so two hits on you, you take 19 points of slashing damage from the first strike.
Ashley: That's not halved? No, it's only halved because he's--
Matt: Only because he's raging.
Ashley: I'm a barbarian, too! (laughter)
Matt: 19 on the first strike, the second one is 13, so that's a total of 32 points of slashing damage to you. And that's going to end the barbarians' turn, everyone else finishes out surprise round, now we're back into full initiative, everyone's in play, top of the round, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. If I aim an arrow, it's at disadvantage?
Matt: If you aimed specifically for something? It would be at disadvantage and a minus five to hit.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to cast, I'm going to cast--
Matt: I mean, he's paralyzed, so it would have advantage, so it would cancel out, it would be just a regular attack at minus five.
Laura: Okay, here's my question.
Matt: Yes?
Laura: The siege arrow that Percy gave me, is that a magical weapon or a technical weapon?
Matt: It's a technical weapon, it's used essentially against structures, objects.
Laura: So just structures.
Matt: It's an explosive in an arrow that is used primarily to destroy structures, yeah.
Laura: So it wouldn't harm people?
Matt: I mean, it would hurt people like a regular arrow, and it might do a little bit extra, but--
Laura: Not anything crazy?
Matt: Not that you know of, you don't have a full understanding of what the arrow's capable of. You did not create it.
Taliesin: I gave you the big debrief with the arrow, I gave you the how-to--
Laura: I know I know I know I know.
Matt: What're you doing? Hurry.
Laura: Okay okay okay! Okay!
Matt: Vax, you're on deck.
Laura: I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at third level into a group, the group. At Kevdak.
Travis: No. Whatever you're going to do. Just do it.
Laura: Just do it? I'm going to do it at Kevdak and anything that is close to him gets hit. Anything--
Matt: Within five feet of him? And you're doing it at what level?
Laura: At level three.
Matt: Level three, so that's 3d10 points of piercing damage. All righty. Okay. So go ahead and make an attack against Kevdak, that is going to be-- Yeah, with advantage because it's not an aimed shot, so go ahead and take it.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: Are you serious?
Taliesin: You've been doing it all night, too. I figure, you know, it's only fair.
Matt: I've gotten like one.
Taliesin: No, you've had more than one. We've been counting.
Matt: I've had two?
Liam: Two for Kevdak's initiative and two for here.
Matt: That's true, that's true, I actually, could've been worse. All right, so. Go ahead and roll against Kevdak, that is going to be six, or 3d10 times two.
Laura: Oh, 3d10? Oh.
Sam: Yeah, oh.
Laura: 20, plus an additional-- oh no, Hunter's Mark dropped because it's a concentration. But I am sneaking-attacking. An additional six. Oh, that's 12 then, because it doubles the dice.
Matt: Correct, yeah.
Laura: So that's 32 points of damage.
Matt: 32 on him, reduce that to 16 piercing. All righty. And then all the rest of them have to make dexterity saving throws against your spell DC. What's your spell DC? This includes Grog.
Laura: 15.
Sam: C'mon, Groggy.
Travis: What, what was it?
Laura: 15.
Travis: What 15?
Sam: You got to make a save to get outta the way. With inspiration.
Laura: With inspiration.
Travis: 17.
Matt: All right, so half damage to you, Grog.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Which is halved again, one quarter, because there's a whole bunch of raging individuals.
Travis: 32, halved is 16, which is eight.
Matt: Two of them succeed as well and also take eight damage.
Laura: They're barbarians as well?
Sam: They're raging? They're raging.
Matt: And then one of them takes full damage at 16. All righty. So. That concludes your action. You want to move, or you going to stay where you are?
Laura: If I fly on my broom, can I go down and grab Pike? As an action? I mean, as a movement?
Matt: It's going to be hard-pressed for you this turn to pull out your broom. I mean, you've been clutching your broom with you this whole time, you leaned it up against the wall as you hid down there?
Laura: Okay. I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going to hide against the window so nobody can see me.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Against on-- yeah, like that.
Matt: That brings us to the next in the initiative order, Vax.
Liam: All right, I want to preface this with, last week I misspoke, I thought I had one Luck left as I used it, but I got it backwards, so I have one Luck left this week in case I want to use it.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Go back and look at the videotape.
Liam: You can. Well no, I said the wrong thing. But anyway, I want to use my first action to shove that archer backward off the roof.
Matt: Shove them?
Liam: Yeah, shove them off.
Matt: All right, let's go ahead and do a shove action. Find myself on this one here-- all right, so, for shove-- I need you to go ahead and--
Liam: Strength?
Matt: --make an athletics check.
Liam: Athletics check.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: I'm going to trigger the Luck right now.
Matt: All right.
Liam: That helped it, yeah. That gets it to 20.
Matt: To 20? That's going to be a 12.
Laura: Yay!
Marisha: Yay!
Matt: So you shove it five feet. This way? All right, so it's going to go ahead and make an acrobatics--
Liam: Ah, no, towards you, Matt, was my intention, yeah.
Matt: Towards me? All right, this way. Shove, they do make an acrobatics check but they do land off the side here. So they take eight points of damage being pushed off the side. All righty.
Sam: This board is incredible.
Matt: So that person's now fallen out of sight (yells), off the side.
Liam: Now, question  am I able to use my bonus action to hide behind that chimney from Kevdak's view, and the archers are, am I able to do that? Just with Kevdak?
Matt: Yeah, the chimney should offer you enough, and you have a tree between the two of you anyway.
Liam: Okay. So I hide behind the chimney.
Matt: Make a dexterity, make a stealth check.
Liam: Stealth check. That's 25.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And I would like to use my last action to throw at Kevdak, so I should still have advantage, because he's held, and I should have, if I'm hiding, it's a sneak attack, isn't it?
Matt: Well, sneak attack is if it's an attack with advantage anyway.
Liam: Oh, my friend's still next to him. Oh, then, then, excuse me, I would like to throw two daggers.
Matt: Well, the shove was your action.
Liam: Right, and I did the boots, so I have action-action-bonus action.
Matt: Okay, hold on. Let me see if it's-- You don't have two actions, you have two attacks. Let me check and see if it is. There is a distinction there.
Liam: Every millimeter counts tonight.
Matt: Yeah, this attack replaces one of them, if you have multiple attacks, with the attack action, which you don't. So you have your offhand bonus and the haste one, so you do have--
Liam: Two attacks right now. Okay. So first one is an 18 to hit Kevdak, second one is a 25 to hit Kevdak.
Matt: Both hit.
Liam: Both hit. Okay. So the first one, (counting).
Marisha: That rogue damage. That rogue damage!
Liam: I'm missing a big pile of dice! Eight, 12, 13, 19, 22, 28, 30, 36.
Matt: 36, half that to-- I know, that brings it to 36, 18.
Liam: Is it? It's not a crit, right?
Matt: No, but it's half-damage for him.
Liam: Right, I have to be right up against him to get a crit, and the second dagger does eight halved to four.
Matt: Okay, four damage, gotcha. Total 22 points of damage on him. As he's taking all these hits. All right.
Liam: And I have a little bit of movement, right?
Matt: You do have a little bit of movement, because you--
Liam: I'll go fwoosh, right up against the flat side, right below Keyleth, pressed against the wall there.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Looking up her windskirts?
Liam: No. Not that.
Marisha: I've got a Marilyn Monroe thing going on in my air elemental, oh.
Matt: There we go. So you're now hidden up against that roof right below there, and your stealth check was 25 earlier, so we'll go with that.
Liam: All right, maybe, maybe a quick look. Maybe a quick look.
Matt: Move the board a little bit for the people that are watching so they can get a better view here. There we go. So you're over here. Right here, Liam. All right. So! That brings us to--
Liam: Oh, shit! Never mind.
Sam: Six more attacks!
Matt: No, you're done, your turn's over.
Liam: Never mind, I didn't say it, I didn't say it so it doesn't matter.
Matt: Yeah. All right, so. This archer here is going to turn, looking over at the-- let's see. He's currently handled, he's okay right there. This archer saw you firing. Over in that hide, he's going to turn to you.
Taliesin: I'm looking at him right now, actually, I've got my gun in my left hand and I'm looking at him.
Matt: Archer's going to take two shots, pulling on his longbow, (arrow sounds). Two arrows at you, Percy.
Taliesin: I smile the whole time. Bring it.
Liam: Staring at him with that dead-in-the-eyes Percy look? Yeah.
Taliesin: Do not fuck with Reed Richards. He will fuck you up.
Matt: That is a 20 to hit on the first one.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: And a 25 on the second.
Taliesin: That, that also hits.
Sam: Everybody's rolling high tonight. Except us.
Matt: First one is 11 points of piercing damage to you.
Taliesin: 11 for the first one?
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: I take it in the shoulder.
Matt: All right. The second one is going to go ahead and do 13 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: That one I'm going to catch.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll for it.
Sam: Gloves of Missile Snaring!
Taliesin: That's 14, so not only does it do no damage, I actually take it and catch.
Matt: You catch the arrow in front of your face.
Taliesin: Snap it.
Matt: (laughs) That's amazing.
Taliesin: And the gun is going to turn to look at him.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: Nice, Percy.
Matt: You can see from the distance the visage of this half-orc looks back as you do that and goes-- And goes to shakily-- hand reaching back for another arrow. This archer's going to go ahead and leap down onto here. Oh, you do get an attack of opportunity on him.
Laura: He knocks down a tree in the process.
Marisha: What a dick! That's a natural 18, so that's a 26.
Matt: Pretty sure that hits. Also rolled a natural 19 on the acrobatics check, so lands fine, but you do manage to do one attack worth of damage to him as he jumps down.
Liam: Airsoft shot to the nuts.
Marisha: I rolled double ones.
Laura: Pathetic!
Marisha: Plus five, so seven.
Laura: That's not bad, that's not bad.
Marisha: Little damage.
Liam: Something to remember you by.
Ashley: Maybe he only has like ten hit points.
Matt: Cool, so your elemental form swings wide, manages to slam the bottom of them as they leap down, sending them into a spin, but they do manage to catch themself because they're quite acrobatic. In doing so, they step up to the very edge here to their friend, who is currently on the ground, who is also going to get up there, and they're both going to look at each other, pull their arrows out, and they're going to go ahead and make a series of strikes. Let's see. This one here is going to go ahead and is going to shoot at Pike, because Pike's on the ground. And this one's going to go ahead and strike at Grog, because it can't see Percy over there through the tree. So Grog--
Laura: Natural one, natural one.
Matt: That is a 19.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Misses you? (arrow sound) One arrow hits the bit of your shoulder armor right here and shatters off the bone. The second one, however, is a 26.
Travis: Yes, that hits.
Matt: All right, so. From that one, you take, I don't like that, cocked. Nine points of piercing damage. Reduced to four. The one that's taking two strikes at you, Pike, because you're on the ground, now.
Ashley: It's also probably very hard for him to shoot through the people that are attacking me.
Matt: There is one individual attacking you that is on the other side of your body, so you're pretty visible from that point in time.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: She's really little.
Matt: However, the attack, because you are prone, it has disadvantage on the attack rolls with you because it's not within five feet of you. But it's going to go ahead and attempt to make it. Two 17s in a row. Plus ten, that's-- sorry, not plus ten, plus eight on the archers, yeah, plus eight. So that's 25?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: And natural one on the other disadvantage, so that misses. You take 13 points of piercing damage from one of the arrows, (arrow sound). So it's going to do there. They finish their turns. This one is going to, being pushed, shoved off, come around here.
Marisha: What? Who's that?
Laura: Oh, that's the one you pushed off the roof.
Matt: Is going to come over this way and hide to the side. Just going to watch what's happening. That finishes the archers' turn. Kevdak. (grunts) Unable to do anything, is going to attempt to make a saving throw. And that is going to be a total of 18. What's your DC?
Sam: 20. (yelling)
Travis: Oh, Scanlan! I will make out with that fucking shirt, I swear to god!
Sam: I mean, my spell DC's 18, but with the Hand Cone of Clarity, okay.
Taliesin: Don't talk him out of it.
Sam: Just making sure.
Matt: Oh man. All right, well, that ends Kevdak's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Okay. I, while maintaining concentration I can still use the wand to do things, yeah? So I'll use three charges of the Wand of Fireballs.
Matt: What're you doing now?
Sam: I'm aiming a Fireball right around there.
Matt: So moving up to here.
Sam: Oh yes, I guess I have to move forward to attack. Can I get a radius that includes Kevdak and these guys over here?
Matt: Yeah, you can do that.
Sam: But not Pike. And hopefully not Grog if my aim is true.
Matt: Yeah, if you get it there you can manage to hit all of them but Grog right there.
Sam: Okay.
Ashley: Go Scanlan!
Matt: One, two, three, four, five, six.
Sam: Okay. Three charges is 10d6.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll that. Kevdak automatically fails, because he's paralyzed.
Liam: Yeah. MVP.
Matt: So does Greenbeard.
Sam: 34.
Matt: All right, so. 34, reduced to half because he's raging. That brings it to six, no, 17. All right, and then Greenbeard takes 34. The other ones there, they do not get advantages because they're all just fighters, that's a failure, failure, what was the spell DC on the wand? Because it's different from yours.
Sam: DC's 15, I wrote it down. DC 15.
Matt: Okay, so that's a success. Success. So two of them over there take-- all right.
Taliesin: It'll be fine, it'll be fine, things are working.
Matt: All righty. Great, so (explosion). Giant burst of flame hits, it actually sets fire to this entire structure. The wooden barricade is in flames, we'll say for the purposes of considering that.
Sam: There's flaming spikes on the field!
Marisha: Flaming spikes!
Matt: All right, so. There we go. There is currently--
Taliesin: I was really hoping you were going to come up with a-- oh wow, that's actually-- never mind, I am not disappointed at all.
Matt: So those are on fire.
Marisha: Hah, 'I thought you were going to come out with a f-- that, that, yeah, that works, that.'
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: I'm going to try to do the Pike move and jump down one level.
Matt: Down there? All right, make an acrobatics check.
Sam: Oh, Jesus. Okay, okay. 14-- 19!
Matt: 19. You leap down and make it right there.
Sam: Okay. And I will, with the bonus, I will heal Grog with a Healing Word.
Matt: Healing Word, okay. What's the range on it?
Sam: Oh. 60 feet for Healing Word, I believe. Right?
Matt: He's just out of your range.
Sam: Okay, well then I will heal Pike, is that okay?
Matt: You can do that, you can shout over the side. You have to get into view of her, which means you have to move a little bit closer to the edge, but yeah.
Sam: Okay, I'll do that.
Matt: Okay, so you get about there, glance off the side. All right. Go for it.
Sam: I'll peek over the side and say, (singing) Never going to fuck you up, never going to let you down, never going to run around and not heal you. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll your heal for Pike. Grog, you're up next.
Sam: Yeah, seven points!
Ashley: Oh, I'll take it.
Matt: Hey, it all helps. All right. And with that, Grog, you're up.
Laura: Oh my god. (singing) Natural crit.
Travis: So in my frenzied reckless attacking, great weapon master, can I bring my axe up high and swing it for the first attack to his left side where dangly hand is?
Matt: You can, go for it. Your regular straight attack. You have advantage, and then it's disadvantage for that, so that brings it to a regular attack. Minus five.
Travis: Disadvantage for the?
Matt: Because of the called shot.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: But then advantage because it's reckless?
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23? Hits. With the minus five?
Travis: No. 18.
Matt: Still hits. (cheering)
Taliesin: You asshole.
Matt: So it's a d12.
Travis: (counting) 20 for the first one. 30, with great weapon master.
Laura: But you double your dice because it's a natural crit, because he's five feet away.
Matt: Because he's paralyzed and five feet away.
Travis: 60.
Laura: No, just your dice, double your dice.
Matt: This is with your axe, right? So with the axe, it's a d12 plus your raging bonus, plus your strength.
Travis: 11. Which is seven. Or eight. Rage bonus is eight.
Matt: Well, the rage bonus should be plus-- the total becomes plus--
Travis: Oh sorry, the total bonus is eight.
Matt: Three plus-- four, isn't it, right now? So it should be seven.
Travis: That's why that's a seven. That's it. Right.
Matt: Yeah. You're not using your warhammer. You're not attuned to this weapon.
Travis: Right, okay, so whatever.
Matt: So what'd you roll on the dice?
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. Technically it's a critical hit. So, I mean, it's a critical hit, so you do your brutal critical. You roll two more d12s. So it was an 11 times two, that's 22, plus seven, that's 29, plus 2d12.
Travis: Five, so that's 34.
Matt: 34.
Travis: And a nine, so that's 43.
Matt: 43 reduced to half, that's 21 points of slashing damage.
Travis: And that's the first one, called shot.
Matt: With that, thunk, the blade finds its way into his side, as you hear cracking on the rock below him, the sound of the left gauntlet, (cracking) hitting the bottom of the square. The fingers twitch in the gauntlet as he's currently standing there with his left arm bisected from the rest of his body.
Laura: Does he shrink?
Matt: No.
Laura: Dammit.
Travis: Second attack, straight across his back.
Matt: Okay, straight into his back?
Sam: Does another smaller doll hand come out to replace it?
Laura: Teeny tiny.
Travis: That is a 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Travis: Yeah, 22. Okay. And that's four, so double this-- 12, right? So four times two is eight. Plus four is 11. Math is a bitch. And two more of them? Because it's a critical? Okay. Seven. And a nine.
Matt: 28, half that is 14.
Laura: Math! Math is fun!
Matt: So you're hacking into him, you see the wounds are opened and his body is shaking from the amount of pain that's wracking him at this time. He's still holding up against a lot of damage that's come to him, but he's starting to look a little rough.
Travis: So I have my third frenzied attack for a bonus action, right? With my bonus action I have one superior healing potion. Can I take that?
Matt: You can, yeah. That will heal you, a superior, let's see. Superior is 8d4 plus eight.
Travis: 8d4 plus eight?
Matt: Your superior, that's the expensive one you guys got.
Liam: 8d4, four-sided, the four-sided. Pyramids.
Travis: Fuck me, asshole. Fuck. Fuck me asshole! Seven. Nine. Ele-- 12. 14. 16. 19. 20. 20.
Matt: All right, so you heal 20. All right, that ends your turn, Grog. All righty. Unless you want to move.
Travis: Can I, can I-- huh?
Laura: You could pick it up.
Travis: I can't pick it up, I can only move.
Matt: I mean, you have, you wouldn't be able to wield your axe.
Laura: But can you put it in the Bag of Holding?
Matt: Next turn, if you want to try it.
Travis: No, I'm going to, can I move, if I stay in his flank, if I move away from the three guys that are surrounding me, they're--
Matt: They're all going to get an attack on you.
Travis: I'll stay.
Matt: All right. All right, so that finishes your turn, Grog.
Travis: Yes, thank you.
Matt: Next up is Greenbeard, who is currently frozen in place, however, rolls an 18 plus five, as far as, his wisdom is plus ten, so that puts him at 28. So he resists the Hold Person and is currently no longer affected by that. All right, that finishes his turn, though, because that's the end of his turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right. This is going to be fun. That asshole who just shot me, I'm now aiming at him. And I'm going to push him off the roof, this'll be fun. So, pushing him off the roof, am I going to do extra damage to him, or am I?
Liam: If he hits. If he hits the ground.
Taliesin: Well, I mean, I'm debating whether or not to sharpshooter it to do-- no, I think I'll just push him off the roof. It's funnier.
Travis: I can feel my heartbeat in my face.
Laura: I know, I can't tell if it's actually really warm in here or if we're all just really hot.
Matt: Probably a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. What was it?
Taliesin: 28 to hit.
Matt: 28 hits. Non-sharpshooter?
Taliesin: Non-sharpshooter.
Sam: Dullshooter.
Taliesin: But I'm doing a torso shot. So he gets no save, there's no save for the torso shot, he's going to take his damage and move ten feet away from me.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So. That's 14 points of damage, of piercing damage.
Matt: 14 points of piercing damage and he gets shoved off the back of the roof, he's going to make an acrobatics check, which he succeeds, so he lands down there and he only takes one point of damage from the fall, but. There you go.
Taliesin: Fine. I'm going to reload, and now, what am I going to do? Let's see.
Sam: Jump down the chimney, deliver presents.
Taliesin: Surveying the field, trying to make some decisions.
Sam: Help Pike!
Taliesin: I can't. Well!
Marisha: Can you hit Greenbeard?
Taliesin: I can hit Greenbeard, I'm going to hit Greenbeard. He's got the magicky creepy thing, right?
Laura: Yeah, he's gross. He's got mold on his neck.
Matt: Fungal moss on his whole neck and chest area.
Taliesin: All right. Well, we'll see how things go. Let's do a sharpshooter shot at him right now. Let's see what a little bit of damage does to him. So sharpshooter with Retort. Don't miss. And my pistol goes (breaking sound). (groaning)
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: And I'm putting it away, so.
Matt: Okay, all right, so that's going to end your turn? Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: All right. Tornado's coming down the house. I'm going to hit these two guys with a Whirlwind again.
Matt: Right here?
Marisha: Yep. 13 strength save.
Matt: 13 strength saves on both of them. Archers-- all right. That's a natural 19 plus two, and two natural 19s in a row. Yeah, they both make their saves.
Marisha: So nine plus-- oh, one more d8. Plus another five, so that was 12 plus five is 17, plus another two, so 19 halved.
Matt: 19 halved? All right, so that puts them at nine points of bludgeoning damage each. Not really having much of an effect at this point in the fight, however, as you swirl around, picking up the debris from the roof as you can, it slams into them and they brace against it, but they still, glancing over their shoulder, realize that they've got to continue what they're doing now. The bigger threat appears to be out in front of them.
Marisha: I'm staying in their space, by the way.
Matt: Right, right, so you're up in there. Up in their shit.
Laura: Up in their business? Oh, it fell anyway! It happened.
Matt: There you go. No. All righty. Finished your turn? All right. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: All right. I'm going to put on my Sprinter's Boots.
Matt: They're on you, right?
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: So you're getting up, that's half your movement to stand up, all right.
Ashley: Yeah. Okay. And I'm going to run around towards the back of the house.
Matt: This way?
Sam: Door.
Matt: What're you doing? Ashley, what're you doing? So your Sprinter's Boots activate, which gives you double movement. Right? So you can move 50 feet. But you moved up, it took you 25 to stand up because it's half your speed to get up from prone, so you still have 25 feet you can move.
Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to go around to the side.
Matt: This side? All right, so you move. Here? Right?
Ashley: Yeah, as far as it'll--
Matt: Okay, so you rush over there. That one guy takes a swing at you as you rush by, gah!, or girl I should say, the female half-elf swings with the giant blade. That's going to be a 23?
Ashley: Fuck. Yeah.
Matt: Okay. As the blade smacks you from behind as you rush past, you suffer 14 points of slashing damage. In your back. But you keep running around the edge. All right, what are you doing?
Ashley: All right, I'm going to heal myself.
Matt: All righty.
Ashley: A little, doing a little rough here. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself. At third level.
Sam: Isn't this exciting?
Liam: Yes it is!
Marisha: Good times, guys.
Sam: We're fighting a horde of goliaths!
Matt: What you got, Ashley?
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: What you got, what you doing?
Ashley: Oh, I cast Cure Wounds on myself.
Matt: And you're done? You're healed up? Okay, that's the end of your turn.
Ashley: I can't do any, don't I have a bonus action?
Matt: You have a bonus action still if you want.
Laura: You got your spiritual weapon still.
Ashley: Okay, I'm going to use my spiritual weapon on him again, on Kevdak.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and swing for the attack on that one.
Ashley: Okay, and I'm going to use Guided Strike?
Matt: Well, I mean, yeah, you have advantage. You have advantage on the attack, by the way, he's paralyzed. He's still paralyzed.
Laura: Oh, that's good!
Ashley: It's still under it.
Laura: Don't you add anything to it?
Matt: Add your spell attack.
Ashley: Oh, yeah, well then I'm great. Fuck, I'm forgetting everything, I'm so nervous!
Matt: It's okay, you've been away for a while.
Ashley: Okay. Yeah, we're good to go. 22.
Matt: 22? That hits. So go ahead and roll your 3d8, I think it is, no, 4d8.
Laura: 4d8.
Matt: Plus your wisdom modifier, which is plus-- what's your wisdom modifier?
Sam: She's doing math, give her a second.
Taliesin: Dice are doubled, too? The weapon's within five feet.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: (nerdy voice) Oh, the weapon's within five feet.
Laura: Do you add the spell attack bonus to it?
Taliesin: Suck it, nerd. Dear god.
Matt: No, it's not attack, it's your wisdom modifier, but what's the dice, the dice are doubled because it's a critical hit.
Travis: 18.
Laura: Times two.
Matt: 36, half that to 18. Then add your wisdom modifier.
Laura: Plus four!
Matt: Plus four. All right, so. Half of that would be two, so 20. 20 points of damage to him from the strike of that. All righty, that finishes your turn.
Travis: Does your piece of paper back there look like Stephen Hawking's chalkboard?
Matt: Kind of, right now, yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: That's actually way more organized than I thought it would be.
Travis: Young Stephen Hawking. You horrible, horrible person.
Matt: First, the woman who just swung past you is going to go ahead and rush around the corner as well and follow you, since you got out of the way. Rush into and go after you, Pike. The three that are on you, Grog, are still going to, after watching you cut one of Kevdak's arms off, roar angrily around you, all three of them (roar), and go into another round of angry, angry strikes against you.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: All right, so that comes to you, Grog, since you did reckless attack on him for the stuff, they all have advantage on you anyway, so all the attacks are with advantage, that's six attacks.
Marisha: Six attacks.
Matt: That's a natural 20. (yelling)
Matt: 26 on the second. 23 on the third.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: 24 on the fourth.
Taliesin: Can you roll poorly?
Matt: 26 on the fifth.
Sam: Wow.
Liam: Welcome to our production of Julius Caesar.
Matt: No, they all, five hits and one crit.
Laura: What?
Matt: They all hit, yeah. Reckless attack puts you in a bad position when you're surrounded with guys that can do multiple hits that are also barbarians.
Liam: Here it comes.
Marisha: Get that barbarian's resistance.
Matt: We'll do the crit first on you.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: You already used the Stone's Resistance. Oh, the barbarian, yeah. So that'll help.
Travis: Don't say the word yet.
Marisha: Well.
Sam: Is it that thing where you die?
Matt: Seven plus eight, 15, reduced to half, that's seven. So I'll give you the direct amounts here. So this is with the reduction. So that's seven points of slashing damage. Another seven.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Another seven.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Here we go. That's a nine.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Not that great. That's a six.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And then now the crit.
Laura: I thought you said the first one was a crit.
Liam: That's what you said.
Matt: And then I thought differently but I didn't say it out loud, but because you're calling me on it, I'll let it happen.
All: No, no, no.
Liam: Are you saying what's in your head is different than what's in my head?
Matt: Okay. That was double sixes. So that's 22 plus eight is 30, so 15 points of slashing damage. On all those strikes against you. Pike? Two attacks on you.
Sam: You still alive there?
Matt: That's a natural 20. And that's 15.
Ashley: No.
Matt: No, so. That is a one and two, so that's three, six plus eight, you take 14 points of slashing damage from this barbarian female who's all up on your grill.
Ashley: I hate this bitch!
Matt: Ending that turn, it's now the druid's turn over here. End of surprise round, the druid's going to rush forward here. And do a 5th-level Cure Wounds. On Kevdak.
Taliesin: No!
Marisha: I mean, he doesn't have an arm, he doesn't have the arm. That was-- he can't get that back.
Liam: He can't get the bone or stuff, I hope.
Marisha: I know, how does that work if you only have half your--
Liam: Ask that guy.
Matt: All right, we're looking at 5d8.
Sam: You know what? Fuck it. I'll Counterspell that.
Matt: Yeah, it's too high, or no, okay. So. It's at a fifth level. Go ahead and roll for it, adding, so it's d20 plus five, plus two because of your bardic knowledge.
Laura: That's not concentration, it doesn't do anything.
Sam: It's not concentration, right, Counterspell? So what do I do, just a d20?
Matt: Roll a d20, add seven.
Sam: 17.
Matt: Let me check here real fast. Plus the spell's level. Yeah. It's dispelled.
Sam: It's dispelled?
Matt: Yeah, Counterspell. (cheering)
Matt: It was 15, was what he had to beat.
Marisha: MVP this fight!
Taliesin: Oh my god, Sam. Oh my god.
Liam: Scanlan's going to Disneyworld!
Matt: Okay. (laughs) All right. That ends his turn. Now. So. This guy here, let's see. Got to stand up for this one, pardon me.
Sam: Oh, shoot.
Laura: Shit. Shit.
Ashley: Should we just take a break or something?
Sam: The benches we're sitting on are covered in so much ass sweat right now.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of this, going to put him up there.
Sam: Who dat? Who's up there? What's going on right there?
Matt: This guy jumps up this way.
Sam: Hey wait, well, that's where I am, I don't want him to come up there!
Matt: Too bad.
Taliesin: Does he get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: These two guys rush forward and grab these innocents here.
Laura: Oh my god. This is where it all turns.
Ashley: Because I fucking fell off the fucking roof.
Matt: Yeah, into the middle here, towards the fire.
Liam: Head of the snake.
Marisha: Into the fire? What?
Matt: Pushing them towards the fire with what remains of their movement. Let's see, this guy's going to move in towards Grog there. This archer's going to get back up--
Sam: (belches) Pardon me. Was that out loud?
Marisha: It's okay, we're not live.
Laura: No!
Matt: Well actually, no, archers aren't part of this movement. This guy here's going to move into Grog there.
Sam: Now he has seven people attacking him.
Matt: I don't know what to tell you, man. These guys here, seeing, hah. This guy's going to be up with this one here. This guy can't really get over there, so he's going to go ahead and rush forward.
Laura: How many people are there? I feel like there's so many more people than there were.
Taliesin: How do you own this many models?
Laura: Why are you doing this to Pike? Stop hurting her!
Sam: Only you can protect her.
Ashley: We should've killed the guys first.
Taliesin: There's no should'ves, this is what we got.
Ashley: Okay guys, we can do this, we can do this.
Marisha: It was going pretty well.
Laura: Why did it all turn?
Marisha: How did he fucking scale that fast?
Laura: Because he can roll acrobatics just like we can!
Matt: Because they're-- yeah, you guys can do it, they can do it too. And they're pretty strong. So he basically runs up, puts the sword on his back, jumps up onto the roof, pulls the weapon. He doesn't manage to get an attack on you, because it took all of his movement to get up there. But he gets up there.
Marisha: No one wants to fuck with the elemental? Really? No one?
Matt: Right now, you're not a huge threat to them at the moment and they're both going to focus actually on you, Scanlan. When it gets around to their turn, though. This guy's going to go ahead and pull both of these innocent folk in front of them as a shield. This guy's going to get freaked out, rush around the building and try to escape there. Okay. So! Bringing us into the combat portion of the round, Grog, you have two more attacking you. This is the bladestorms.
Travis: Bladestorms?
Matt: With advantage, that's going to be a 14.
Travis: That'll miss. I haven't said that much tonight.
Matt: 18?
Travis: That misses.
Matt: So first one, both attacks swinging across you, you're feeling it on your back, but it's catching most of your armor and part of your flesh that is nice and calloused and does not really do any damage. The second one rolls a 20. Second one, and second attack on the second one is a 21.
Travis: That hits, yeah.
Matt: Yeah. Okay. So you get a critical and hit on this one. So this is the bladestorm. Critical is going to be 16, eight points of slashing damage on that one. And the next one's going to be four points of slashing damage. This is already halved. Just so you know. So that's that round there. Against Pike, only one of them could get to you and still attack this round, so Pike, that's 19?
Ashley: Misses.
Matt: And that's going to be a 15.
Ashley: Misses.
Matt: So one strikes against you, hits the back of the armor and streaks off, so you spin around as the second blade comes around and you deflect it with the shield angrily.
Marisha: Yes!
Ashley: This is so fucking stressful!
Matt: That brings us back to the top of the initiative order. Vex, you're up.
Sam: What, they just approached me, they didn't attack me?
Matt: Oh, there was the one guy that got up there with movement. Thank you for the reminder. So before that happens, actually, reminder, this one did have enough movement to get up there and still get attacks off on you.
Laura: Okay, he's attacking Percy.
Sam: No, he's attacking me.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: That's going to be a 13 with the first strike.
Sam: That misses.
Matt: Misses, second one's going to be a 22.
Sam: That just hits. (laughter)
Matt: All right, that's going to be 17 points of slashing damage from that greatsword, whoosh. I need you to go ahead and make a concentration check.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Yeah, you have Warcaster, so you have advantage on that.
Laura: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: 15-- plus anything?
Matt: It's a constitution.
Sam: Ooh. Plus two. 17.
Matt: So 17.
Taliesin: That's pretty good.
Matt: Going to check it real fast, concentration here-- plus ten, half the damage you take. So that would be ten, yeah, you maintain concentration.
Laura: Oh, thank god.
Travis: We might as well just be doing this on a treadmill, because I think I'm pretty close to 130?
Matt: All right, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to fly out of the window on the broom.
Liam: The roof blows off.
Laura: Out of the window.
Matt: Where do you want to go?
Laura: I'm going to fly down and I'm going to shout, Grog! Raise your arm! And I'm going to go down and I'm going to hit his hand with the Pokeball.
Liam: Shit.
Matt: You're going to scoot by here?
Laura: I'm above, I want to be high up in the air but low enough that I can reach down and touch the locket to Grog's hand.
Matt: Okay, it's a good thing Kevdak is paralyzed, because otherwise he'd get an attack on you.
Laura: I know, I know.
Matt: This will put you in range for their strikes, so you're going to have to stay in place or move past and suffer five attacks of opportunity.
Laura: Wait, all of them can attack, but I'm in the air!
Matt: But for you to get low enough to hand him that, they all have big double greatswords, and they're-- well, half of them are half-giants. So you can do this. As you swish up, which you've already said you're going to do, you fly up and you reach down.
Laura: With the locket and I hit.
Matt: With the locket and you hand over to him, do you--
Laura: I don't hand it to him.
Matt: Okay. So you just hold it there?
Laura: I'm putting Grog in the fucking locket.
Matt: Oh.
Travis: She's trying to medevac me.
Matt: I misunderstood what you were trying to do. All right, so, what--
Laura: I want to fly by and poof and keep going.
Matt: What's it say again?
Laura: It's a wisdom save, but if it's a willing person they can go in.
Matt: Yeah. So, Grog, are you willing?
Travis: Well. Yes.
Matt: And with that, as you reach down and touch Grog with it, you see Grog's form shimmer for a second into dark shadow, and then vanish inside--
Laura: And I want to fly on past and go up to the next roof.
Matt: Okay. So Grog is currently off the table as he's locked inside the gauntlet.
Laura: Where should I go, where should I go?
Matt: Where are you going? As you rush away, you do get--
Laura: I'm going to fly back into the-- I'm going to fly around the back of the big building.
Matt: Back here, you mean?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. We'll say for the purposes of this, you are back here.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: As you fly off from doing this, all of them swing wide at you, that's five attacks of opportunity against you. That's 20.
Laura: Hits.
Matt: That is 17.
Laura: It did? What'd you, what'd you give me?
Travis: Yeah, she gave you, she handed out, before we moved out.
Laura: Oh, that's right, she gave me a blessing.
Matt: Well, it's Aid, you have 15 extra hit points. So that's what it is.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Ashley: I thought it was the armor class goes up one.
Sam: I got 15 extra hit points.
Matt: Yeah, Aid just gives you guys extra hit points. So anyway. 17. Doesn't hit. All right. So three more attacks. That was cocked. 19?
Laura: It's my armor class.
Matt: All right, 26?
Laura: Fuck. Balls. Shit. Mother bitch.
Matt: And that's 19 again. So four attacks hit you.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: First one is for 14 points of slashing damage.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Next one, hoo, that's eight, 12 points of slashing damage.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: Doubled. Halved.
Taliesin: Stop it! Don't be helpful!
Matt: Nine plus four-- another 13 points of slashing damage.
Laura: Dammit. Okay.
Matt: And the last one. That's going to be 15 points of slashing damage.
Laura: Great, cool, great. I'm fine and I'm just going to keep going.
Matt: You streak off as all these blades hammer into your side, cutting the bottom of your feet, one of them hits you in the back of the neck and curves across your lower back, and as you pull away clutching it, you look at your hand with the blood pooling in the middle of your palm, and you look at the gem with a faint glimmer of a form of a human inside the gem that's currently mingling with all the blood that's smeared across your body, as all of a sudden you coast around, through the air, the wind whirling past you, and you spin around towards the top of the Margrave's estate. And you can hear the blood in your body-- (heartbeat sounds)-- in your ears as you start getting a little dizzy and realizing just how rough you are at the moment from that exchange.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Wow.
Matt: Technically you'd probably be higher than this. Up there, if you wanted to fly around. Okay. So. That ends your turn?
Laura: That-- yeah.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm going to use my bonus action to dash, and hasted I get 24 squares of movement on this board.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: I'm going to drop off the roof, staying along the wall, I should be able to take a diagonal at that corner and totally avoid Greenbeard.
Matt: Oh, you mean, dodge off--?
Liam: I want to go, no, I want to go straight this way. Towards the tree, and drop.
Matt: Towards the tree, drop off here?
Liam: All right. Yep. I want to go along the wall. I can swoop around it and avoid Greenbeard, I'm going to run past this barbarian, she'll probably take an attack but I'm wearing that cloak so she's at disadvantage. I'm going to run up to Kevdak and I'm going to stab him twice-- I should get sneak attack damage and a crit, because he's frozen.
Matt: You do.
Liam: Then I'm going to run the fuck out. That's what I'd like to do.
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Matt: You rush up, you manage to avoid Greenbeard, there is one of these guys there who was holding his place, seeing what things were going on, he had no target at the moment, was staying nearby. With disadvantage, that is 21?
Liam: Misses. 22.
Matt: 22!
Liam: Daggers out, hasted. Raven Queen armor, fuck y'all.
Matt: As you dart past, this blur of dark motion swings towards you, and where it is about to catch some of the armor, there's a burst of black feathers that lift behind where the blade struck through. As you dart up right into the face of Kevdak, who's like, (strained sound), trying desperately to resist the effect of this. Go for it. Advantage on the attacks.
Liam: Okay. Advantage on all these, right right right.
Laura: Oh my god. Ermagerd.
Liam: Ermagerd. 22 for the first, which hits. Ah, yeah, they both hit. And 26 for the second. First one. Three plus-- oh my god. Three plus-- Eight, ten, 16, 22, 23, 29, 32. Which is doubled to 64 plus six.
Matt: Well, 32 plus six, because he takes half-damage.
Liam: Right, well, let's get it up to the top and then halve it. So 32 to 64 plus six is 72 halved.
Matt: Right, 72 halved puts you at 36.
Liam: That's the first, and then the second one does two plus six is eight, no, two and, da-ba-ba-ba--
Laura: Four, right?
Liam: That's just the dice is doubled, so four, it's ten.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And I'd like to use the rest of, well, go ahead.
Matt: So yeah, so as you rush up, you slam your dagger square into the side of his body, and as you push it inside, you can see his eyes glancing back down towards you, held in place, his arm broken, still dangling from the little elements of ligaments that keep it shifting there. With the impact of the slam, it swings from the sheer force of the blow. As you push the blade to the hilt and even further in, you feel your hands actually push into the wound itself about an inch, your fingers getting dark and wet with the crimson gore of the interior of his body. As you push up inside, you pull back, pulling the blade around, in your pommel, and jam it over the top of the shoulder, into the side of his body, the muscle flexes from the tension of the Hold Person spell, managing to reduce a portion of the damage, but it left a pretty serious wound.
Liam: Any movement I have left, I want to use to run up to the other side of the wall that Keyleth is on. If I have enough, I'll climb up, if not, I'll go behind that barrel. But if I, before I go, quietly I say to Kevdak, your fate is sealed here today, my friend.
Matt: Okay. He does not get an attack of opportunity on you because he is paralyzed, and the guy already took one against you so he already used his reaction, you rush past him. You do not have enough movement to get to the top, but you do get to the corner right where the barrel is. Okay?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: That ends your turn. It's now the archers' turn.
Laura: Oh god.
Sam: Oh god. So much bloodshed.
Travis: Can we do some recreational drugs or something? Take the edge off?
Laura: We're going to, we're all going to die.
Sam: All we got to do is get Kevdak and they're fucking lost.
Taliesin: I've got a Scrooge McDuck-sized pit of Xanax at my house I'm just going to dive into.
Laura: Once we kill him, his gauntlets are going to be there, we have to go in and get his gauntlets.
Sam: Yeah, that's a point, that's a point made. You know who could get them, who's fast and strong? Trinket.
Matt: This guy here is going to go ahead, he's out of range of you, Marisha. Shoving this barrel off the side to try and get away from you.
Taliesin: Attack of opportunity.
Matt: Marisha, you do get an attack of opportunity, it does fall and hit the barrel next to you, I mean, next to Vax. It doesn't hit you, but it spooks you momentarily as it slams onto the barrel next to your side and rolls off.
Marisha: Rolling terribly.
Matt: What'd you get, Keyleth?
Marisha: Ten total.
Matt: Ten total? Misses.
Marisha: Oh no, oh, I had to roll to hit. I'm sorry, I was rolling damage.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Marisha: I didn't roll to hit. To hit, that is, plus, 16 to hit?
Matt: 16 versus the archer? 17. Just misses.
Sam: You really... blew it.
Taliesin: To be fair, she's a bit winded.
Sam: Oh, she's winded, that's nice, that's nice.
Matt: They're both, having now made out the connection between the mooning and Kevdak holding himself in place, they're both trying to take you out. One of them has disadvantage because you're in its spot and it couldn't get away from you, it had nowhere to go really. So one's taking two attacks at you, Scanlan. That is going to be, heh, a 12.
Sam: Miss.
Matt: And a 26.
Sam: Hit.
Matt: The other one's going to have two attacks with disadvantage against you. That's, even with disadvantage, that's a 21.
Sam: Hit.
Matt: And the other one with disadvantage is a 15.
Sam: Hit.
Laura: What? 15 hits you?
Sam: I am not wearing some things.
Matt: Yeah, it's true. So three attacks hit you.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: The first one is going to be, all right. That's a full ten plus-- 14 points of piercing damage.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Go ahead and roll your concentration.
Sam: Oh, yeah, that.
Matt: So roll and add two.
Sam: Roll and add two, or?
Matt: Because it's plus your constitution.
Sam: Oh. 19.
Matt: 19? Okay. The next attack deals five points. Go ahead and roll again with advantage.
Sam: 19.
Matt: Damn. All right. And the third one. Yeah, what's your constitution saving throw, it's plus two, right?
Sam: Yep.
Matt: Last one does 11 points of piercing damage to you. And make another series of checks for concentration.
Sam: 17.
Matt: Fine.
Laura: We're fine, we're okay, we're okay?
Matt: That Warcaster feat, man. Okay, that finishes those two guys. This one here's off to the side, this one's going to go ahead and turn around this way and get around the edge. Actually, he's going to--
Laura: I'm going to start crying.
Matt: This one over here didn't notice you swing by over the top, swoosh overhead. It does see Percy on the roof that shot it, you do have partial cover, so. We'll say that's half cover, so plus two to your AC against this guy's two arrow shots against you. All righty. That is 26 to hit.
Taliesin: Well, that hits.
Matt: All right. Second strike. Same thing, 26.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: 18 and 18.
Taliesin: 18 and 18? I can use the-- yeah, I only have one reaction, so. All right.
Matt: So that's nine points of piercing damage with the first shot.
Taliesin: I'll take that.
Matt: And 14 points of piercing damage with the second one.
Taliesin: I'll fight that one, I'll contest that.
Sam: This has been a long fight, guys.
Liam: No, this is like 30 seconds later, if that.
Matt: What are you contesting it with?
Taliesin: Gloves of Missile Snaring.
Matt: How many times can you use that?
Taliesin: It's a reaction. It doesn't say, I can make an attempt to catch.
Matt: Yeah. So go ahead and make the attempt.
Taliesin: That's 14 points?
Matt: 14 points, yeah.
Taliesin: Dexterity modifier, 11, so I can reduce it to three points of damage. I still got hit, so.
Matt: So go ahead and mark that. Okay. And this guy over here at the very top moves over as well and is going to go ahead and take two more shots at Scanlan. Since there's currently not a whole lot he can see in the area that's a threat to him, near this gleaming beacon of pink and purple up on the rooftop another friend of his is currently whaling on, so. Two attacks against you. That's going to be a 19.
Sam: Hit.
Matt: And 23.
Sam: Hit.
Matt: All right. You take another six points of piercing damage. Go ahead and make your--
Sam: Yeah, 20.
Matt: What was it? 20? Okay. Second one is 14 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Oh, Jesus.
Sam: Six.
Matt: And with that, the Hold Person fades, concentration lost from the barrage of arrows from the nearby Herd archers. You hear a roar across the battlefield, (roars). Currently with one busted arm, no arm on the other side, Kevdak is screaming in terrible pain and anger.
Liam: But he's great at riverdance. (laughter)
Matt: All right, archers finish their turn. It comes to Kevdak's turn. He's going to go ahead and use his bonus action to go ahead and use Second Wind. Heals 17 hit points on that, rolled a ten. He is then going to-- let's see. Huh.
Marisha: No one's around him.
Matt: Yeah, he has no axe. He reaches over and picks up your hammer.
Taliesin: With his broken hand?
Matt: Oh, yeah, no, actually no, he can't do that right now.
Sam: With his beak.
Laura: He kicks the hammer.
Marisha: He, yeah. He teabags it.
Travis: He kills one of his subordinates for letting him--
Matt: Yeah, he turns to one of his subordinates to the side and says, "One of you, pick that up. The rest of you, kill them." And looks over to the other two innocent that are on the ground right now. He then is going to go ahead and start moving over towards Greenbeard.
Sam: Because he moves.
Matt: Yes?
Sam: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?
Laura: Oh, the Spiritual Weapon!
Matt: A Spiritual Weapon is technically not a creature. It doesn't get a reaction. It's only on a bonus action you get a chance to attack with it. Yeah. He's going to move over here, around the flames, up to Greenbeard. Okay. That finishes his turn, there's not much else he can do at this point. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Pike, how you doing?
Ashley: I'm at 20. I'm pretty rough. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I have an idea to try and get out of it if I need to.
Sam: Kevdak or Pike?
Laura: They're all clustered right there. If you have something that does area.
Sam: They are, I don't care about them, I just care about Kevdak.
Liam: End the fight, Scanlan.
Laura: Well, Greenbeard can probably heal Kevdak.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: That's probably what he's going over there for.
Sam: I don't think I'll be able to do a Fireball without hitting either Kiki or that innocent.
Marisha: I'm fine, I haven't taken any damage.
Taliesin: She's up 60 bonus hit points.
Marisha: No, I'm up 90 bonus hit points and I haven't taken any damage.
Sam: All right. I'll do the same thing, then. Shit.
Matt: What're you doing, Scanlan?
Sam: Yep. The Wand of Fireballs again.
Matt: How many--
Sam: I have seven charges, I've used three, I'll use three more.
Matt: Okay, where, in the center here at Kevdak?
Sam: Yes, Kevdak is the center square.
Matt: That would hit that archer.
Sam: Would it hit that innocent?
Matt: It would hit those innocents there, both of those innocents.
Sam: Okay. Angle it a little over towards Kiki so it doesn't hit the innocent?
Matt: Yeah, with your angle, you could angle it this way.
Sam: Oh, would it hit Vax that way?
Matt: Yeah, it would.
Liam: It's all right. Do it.
Sam: Okay, I'll kill the innocent.
Liam: Do it!
Sam: I'll kill the innocent.
Liam: I can dodge that shit! I can dodge that shit!
Laura: Scanlan! Don't hurt the innocents!
Sam: I said it already, it's too late.
Matt: Yep. So Scanlan fires the Fireball at Kevdak, it detonates.
Liam: I could've avoided it completely.
Sam: Okay. Yes. Do I just roll? 10d8.
Taliesin: 10d6.
Sam: Six. Six, yes.
Matt: Kevdak, save for that, yeah, he makes his save.
Marisha: Gah, fucking fucker.
Matt: Because it's DC 15. Greenbeard also makes his save.
Sam: 42.
Matt: 42. Damn. (counting) Ten. So Kevdak takes ten points of fire damage.
Sam: Ten? He made his save.
Matt: Because he made his save for half damage, and then he takes half that from his rage. Greenbeard takes 21. He's looking rough, Greenbeard is now burned and (grunts) is looking a bit frenzied at this point. The archer does make the save, high dex, they take 21 points on him.
Sam: (belches) Pardon me.
Matt: This archer there also makes it. However, that one's taken-- no, that one hasn't taken a lot of damage, it was that one over there. This one here does also make his save.
Sam: Ah, Jesus. These guys are unkillable.
Marisha: They all made their saves.
Laura: Surprise attack would've been really good on these guys.
Matt: That guy there does make his save, they're all rolling 15 or above on this.
Laura: God.
Matt: This guy here rolls a natural 20 on his save.
Laura: Fuck all of them!
Matt: Well, that was the innocent there.
All: Oh.
Marisha: Good job, guy.
Matt: It's still 21 points of damage for a peasant, he is incinerated and you hear the horrible scream of pain as--
Sam: Hey, we killed something, guys!
Laura: That was the first thing we killed in this fight.
Matt: First thing you killed in this fight was an innocent villager.
Laura: That is terrible.
Matt: And with that scream that echoes in the back of your mind, knowing the decision you made, a little part of your heart sinks in your chest. However, Keyleth, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity save as well.
Marisha: Yeah. On it. Natural 19.
Matt: All right, so you take 21 points of fire damage.
Sam: Even though I can't see her--
Matt: And actually, that guy technically would be-- yeah, that innocent there would also be in range. He doesn't make his save, he is also incinerated. Both of them burn.
Marisha: Whoops.
Laura: Two peasants dead.
Sam: Sorry.
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: Even though I can't see her, I'm so connected to her, can I try to heal Pike with a big shout?
Matt: As a Healing Word spell? A creature you can see within range, so no, you have to be able to see her to aid her.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Which you could do if you wanted to risk it.
Sam: I don't know if I want to move, this guy is on me.
Taliesin: Yeah, but you're also getting pummeled by arrows.
Laura: That's true.
Taliesin: So maybe standing there is not necessarily the--
Laura: Like, up and over would probably be better.
Sam: He's going to take a whack at me.
Taliesin: He's going to take a whack at you in a minute anyway.
Liam: Can't you stay alongside him the whole time?
Laura: Yeah. If you're within five feet of him, he doesn't attack.
Liam: Just circle him.
Sam: Okay. I'll circle. I don't know, I can't even really see where I am, but. Yeah.
Liam: Just going around him. Kitty-corner.
Matt: So yeah, you get over this side here.
Liam: Oh, he's dead.
Laura: (laughs) Every time.
Matt: All right, so you move around him. And you see Pike now surrounded by a number of the barbarians.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: You can use your bonus action to heal her if you'd like.
Sam: You have some plan or something, right?
Ashley: I mean, who the fuck knows if that's going to fucking work?
Sam: My healing is barely anything. So I'll inspire you instead, I think.
Ashley: Okay. I'll take it, I'll take it.
Matt: How do you inspire her?
Sam: I sing, (singing) Well then I saw her mace, now I'm a believer, without a trace, of blood in her hair. I'm in love.
All: (singing) Ooh-ahh.
Sam: (singing) I'm a believer.
Matt: (singing) Take your d10.
Ashley: (singing) I'll take my d10, use it later.
Matt: Ends Scanlan's turn. That's the end of your turn. Grog, you are sealed. You have no turn.
Laura: Sorry, Grog. I was trying to keep you from dying.
Matt: Brings us to Greenbeard, who's in a rough place right now. Greenbeard is going to go ahead and finally do something.
Sam: God dammit, he's going to heal fucking Kevdak. It's a new round.
Matt: "Kevdak. Protect the Herd." And he reaches forward and touches him.
Ashley: Fuck that guy.
Sam: Yeah, I'll counterspell that too.
Matt: As he's right there. That's Heal.
Marisha: No, I knew it, I knew it, it's going to heal him for all of his hit points.
Sam: I'm counterspelling.
Matt: Okay, so that's a 6th-level. Go ahead and roll, add seven, and you have to get 16 or higher.
Sam: Can I cast it at a higher level?
Marisha: Heal is a 7th-level spell.
Matt: What level are you casting Counterspell at?
Sam: Do I know what this spell is?
Matt: No, Heal, 70. Old version was almost all your hit points.
Sam: Fifth level.
Matt: At fifth level? All right, so you're casting it at fifth level. Counterspell, mark that off. Less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you use. So it is fifth level, doesn't do anything. Because what fifth level does is it increases the equal level of the spell to cancel. Fifth level, it's a 6th-level spell, so now you just roll. So now roll. Add seven. You're trying to get 16 or higher.
Laura: No!
Ashley: What is it, what is it, what is it?
Sam: It was a three. But I get advantage.
Matt: No.
Sam: Because I'm wearing this.
Matt: With that, Greenbeard reaches out and touches Kevdak. Kevdak roars in pain as all of a sudden the muscles and tendons in his arm reform and in his still-wounded but now-functional arm, he crushes the gauntlet in his hand. "Bring me the other!"
Laura: Shit.
Matt: And you see the other one who was over there reach for the gauntlet.
Marisha: God dammit, I was about to handle that. I was about to handle that! Who's bringing him the gauntlet?
Matt: Greenbeard is now going to go ahead and back behind here, trying to get behind the tree as he now notices he's in the open.
Liam: Burn him up.
Matt: Done his business in that moment. No, as a bonus action, he's going to go ahead and turn into an earth elemental.
Marisha: Who is?
Laura: Greenbeard.
Marisha: Fucking druids! Fucking druids!
Ashley: Kill him! Kill him, Keyleth.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Everything just flipped.
Matt: Now. Percy, you're up.
Sam: Kill Kevdak.
Taliesin: I was going to say, I can't kill Kevdak, he just healed for--
Matt: Kevdak was on the cusp.
Ashley: But now he has 70 extra hit points.
Matt: He does.
Laura: He heals 70 extra hit points? Oh, not 70 percent of his hit points? We can still take him, we can still take him.
Taliesin: Oh, seven hit points.
All: 70.
Travis: 140. We have to hit him for 140.
Taliesin: He healed him 70 hit points. Is he still raging, though?
Matt: Yeah. He continues to rage if he's taken damage since the last round. He's taken a lot of damage.
Marisha: We've got to get those fucking gauntlets.
Laura: Don't let him get the gauntlets, Percy!
Marisha: Where's the gauntlet, can we see the gauntlet on the battlefield?
Matt: It's over here right now, it's on the ground.
Liam: He told somebody to pick it up, but they didn't do it yet.
Taliesin: Okay. No, I can't do that, can I? I look at the guy next to me, I'm going to take a look-- oh god. I'm going to take a running jump off the front of the house.
Sam: Oh my god.
Taliesin: Straight into the--
Laura: In the kill box, you're going into the kill box?
Sam: You're not fast, you're not a fast person!
Taliesin: No, I'm going to jump for the other house.
Matt: All right, go ahead and make an acrobatics check. Oh right, this is a jump, so this would be athletics.
Taliesin: Is it not an acrobatics, I can't do an acrobatics, I can't parkour this? My hands are free.
Matt: I'll say you can make an acrobatics with disadvantage or an athletics with a single roll. Since this is actually the strength of the run, it's not a big distance, so it's not a huge DC for a jump, but it's your call. What do you want to do?
Taliesin: I'll take an athletics. What do you think, athletics or? Oh, no no. I'll acrobatics it with disadvantage.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Yeah, I. Yeah, no.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a one.
Matt: You rolled a one? So, as you leap off the side, your foot hits the edge of the tile, and the blade behind you swings. Which I believe is going to hit you with a 20. Is that your AC?
Taliesin: My AC's 18.
Matt: 18, yeah. You take seven plus four, 11 points of slashing damage.
Taliesin: I'm fine with that.
Matt: The blow, however, is just enough to throw you off-kilter, and you go plummeting down into the alleyway.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Falling prone. You can use your movement to get back up, the remainder of your movement, but you can't move from there. The fall does deal an additional five points of bludgeoning damage.
Taliesin: Don't care.
Matt: All right, so you get back up-- You're now in this alleyway right here facing this line here is all you can really see from your perspective.
Taliesin: Who can I see from my perspective?
Matt: You can see Vax, you can see Kevdak, and you can see this dude here, and an archer, but has partial cover because of the--
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to, as a bonus action I'm going to do a quick heal.
Matt: Okay. Second Wind?
Taliesin: Second Wind. Just to make that go away. God, that's amazing. 18 back, so, I've got--
Matt: Second Wind, man.
Taliesin: And  ow! I'm going to pull out the big gun and I'm going to take a nice heavy serious look at Kevdak. What am I going to hit him with? I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot in his face. I'm going to go for a headshot with the big gun.
Matt: A headshot? With the big gun?
Taliesin: A headshot. With the big, with sharpshooter.
Matt: Right, so you're using the trickshot on him.
Taliesin: Trickshot on sharpshooter. I'm doing a combo. 23 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: I don't feel good.
Travis: I have the worst headache right now.
Taliesin: I feel really bad right now. I don't feel happy. All right, so that's-- first the damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: That's 26 points of piercing damage.
Matt: 26 points of piercing damage, reduced to half, 13.
Taliesin: Plus he has to make a constitution saving throw against a DC of 19.
Matt: Constitution, yeah, that's a 23.
Laura: Wait, what?
Marisha: He just made his constitution save.
Matt: He's got a high constitution, saving throws, it's kind of his thing.
Taliesin: Reloading, taking another shot. I don't care, I don't care.
Matt: Same thing, sharpshooter?
Taliesin: Same thing, sharpshooter, I'm going to--
Matt: Any other trickshots you're going to use, or? Deadshot, anything you want to use?
Laura: This is heroic death music right now.
Taliesin: I hate this music you're playing.
Matt: I could switch it up, if you want.
Taliesin: No no.
Liam: Benny Hill?
Taliesin: I'm going to drop a grit for advantage, because--
Matt: Okay, for deadeye shot?
Taliesin: Deadeye with sharpshooter.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: That's good. It can only go up from there. And we do, all right. That's 19, 26 to hit, that hits.
Matt: With the minus five?
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, no, that's with the minus five, how about that, I rolled a 19.
Matt: Yeah. Great, yeah, so go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: Asshole, asshole, that's better.
Laura: (laughs) He's saying 'asshole, asshole, asshole'.
Taliesin: That is a seven. So that's 17, 18, 19, 20. 30. 36 points of damage.
Matt: 36 halved to 18.
Taliesin: 18. And that's my two shots so I'm not reloaded.
Matt: That's your three attacks. Shot, reloaded, shot.
Taliesin: Shot, reloaded, shot. I'm now going to burn my action surge.
Matt: Okay, angry Percy's angry.
Taliesin: Can I-- I was going to say, can I burn that as a run or can I only burn that as an attack?
Matt: As part of the function, it's like-- You can use your action as a dash, so you could.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my action as a dash to, oh fuck, there's no way around, is there? Fuck it, then, I'm taking another shot.
Matt: All right, so your fourth attack is a reload, fifth is an attack. Go for it. Is this deadeye as well or just regular?
Taliesin: This is sharpshooter as well, no deadeye.
Matt: Okay, sharpshooter, go for the shot.
Taliesin: 23 to hit.
Matt: 23 hits.
Taliesin: I want to save some grit for some problems. (raspberry)
Sam: That's not bad.
Taliesin: Yeah it is.
Marisha: Wait. Did you roll that?
Taliesin: Oh fuck, yeah, thank you! That's the wrong one. Oh, that's so much better.
Matt: Hah, you rolled a 20-sider instead of a 12?
Taliesin: I can't count, my brain.
Laura: We're all breaking.
Marisha: I know, we're breaking under pressure.
Taliesin: 32 points of damage? 32 points of damage.
Matt: 16 points of piercing damage, all right.
Taliesin: And a reload.
Matt: And a reload. That's your turn. Percy is done, dealing a grand total of 47 points of damage in that round. (cheering)
Laura: That's good!
Sam: And I did ten, so we're almost back to where we were.
Marisha: Okay, angry at the fact that I'm not doing much, I'm going to slowly, for flavor, my air elemental's going to start burning a little fire, I'm going to drop my air elemental and I'm going to do Firestorm.
Matt: Okay, Ryan, I need the mini-box that was not brought.
Ashley: (singing) Mini-box.
Liam: Borrow the Thordak mini.
Laura: What if we all die and the dragons take over everything?
Liam: No. No.
Sam: You know, it's this kind of intense fun that you can get in every Loot Crate. (laughter)
Matt: Dammit, Sam.
Sam: Every month, you'll be on pins and needles to see what's in this box.
Matt: All right, for the time being, I'll use this one here. All right, so Keyleth, you revert back.
Marisha: I revert back.
Matt: We'll use this barmaid for the time being.
Laura: You're a barmaid.
Marisha: Aw, I've been demoted.
Liam: Beers for everybody.
Taliesin: We were at the Ren Faire, to be fair.
Marisha: This is alternate timeline version.
Matt: All right, so, Keyleth, what are you doing? You dropped form.
Marisha: I drop form and I'm going to Firestorm all up in this bitch.
Matt: Oh, shit. All right. What are you firestorming, where, what are you doing?
Marisha: Seventh level, so it's ten ten-square-feet. So let's do like--
Matt: Ten ten-foot cubes.
Marisha: Ten ten-foot cubes.
Sam: Jesus. Well see, those peasants would've died anyway, it's not me, it's her, she did it.
Marisha: I could've gone around them.
Matt: So how do you want to arrange this here?
Marisha: So let's start, can I do ten including this archer, ten?
Matt: You can do there, which would burst off the corner, it would hit Kevdak, the archer, and Greenbeard.
Liam: Set that tree on fire.
Marisha: Actually, as part of the spell I can choose to not set the tree on fire. So I choose to spare the tree.
Matt: All right, the tree is spared.
Marisha: All plant life is spared.
Taliesin: Vegan. Sorry.
Marisha: I am not a vegan. From there-- is that a guy, who's that, who's that?
Sam: They're all baddies.
Laura: Everything's bad unless they've got a red ring around them.
Ashley: Kill 'em, baby, kill 'em.
Liam: C'mon, Red!
Laura: C'mon, Kiki!
Ashley: C'mon, Kiki!
Marisha: Another one there.
Matt: Okay, so we have there. There. You'd be able to get one that wouldn't actually hit any of them.
Marisha: That's fine, and then that one. Bam. And then let's go. Can I go four, and then--
Matt: Six, seven, and that's about all you can get.
Marisha: And that got all of these guys? And then can I go eight, nine, get this guy--
Matt: Eight, nine, ten, it wouldn't be able to get that far over. I mean, you could-- (counting).
Marisha: And get all of 'em?
Matt: You could probably get this section there, yeah. Because they're all pretty clustered, just barely.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: And you're doing an "S", which is cool.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage on that, Keyleth.
Marisha: Zorro!
Laura: Sorro!
Marisha: Okay, ten-- Sorro! Sorry.
Laura: What are you rolling, what is the damage?
Marisha: 10d10. Or no, sorry, sorry. 7d10. Wait. Let me double-check. Let me double-check what it is.
Laura: That's a lot. All tens.
Matt: I'd say you'd be able to get this guy, this guy you wouldn't be able to, but all the rest of these you could. As long as you get over there.
Marisha: 7d10. Okay. 7d10.
Matt: 7d10. Dexterity saving throws, correct, against your spell DC?
Marisha: Uh-huh, which my spell DC is 19. Eight.
Sam: Oh, some of those are good.
Marisha: Some of those are good. Plus six, so that's 14, 16, 18, 19. Another nine, around another-- 29.
Matt: 29 total points of fire damage?
Marisha: 29 total points of fire damage.
Matt: Hm. Okay. Kevdak takes-- he failed his save, but he takes half that, so 14 points of fire damage.
Sam: He's back to where he was before the Heal.
Matt: Yep. Greenbeard takes the full. 29.
Laura: But now he's a tank. Greenbeard's an earth elemental.
Matt: Yeah, Greenbeard's taking earth elemental damage now. That archer, that archer burns up, archer screams in pain as it incinerates from the Firestorm.
Sam: Wait, somebody died?
Laura: An archer died!
Sam: Oh, thank god.
Matt: That bladestorm there takes 29 damage. That guy there, they all take 29 damage. That druid fails.
Taliesin: Are they on fire now too?
Laura: They're all burning to death slowly.
Matt: 29 damage there. That druid and the rest of them, fail, success, fail with a one, fail. Fail with another one. Okay, so 29, all righty.
Liam: While the entire square sets on fire, Vax quietly and quickly falls a little deeper.
Ashley: Falls a little deeper in what?
Liam: In love.
Laura: Oh. Aww!
Ashley: Oh. Aww!
Matt: All right, cool. All righty.
Marisha: I light Vax's fire in the meantime.
Matt: So. That finishes your turn with a Firestorm?
Marisha: No it does not, I'm going to use a bonus action to do Grasping Vine.
Matt: Too high-level, you can't do it, Grasping Vine's a 4th-level spell. You can only do up to a second level as a bonus.
Sam: Can you use your bonus action to heal?
Marisha: I could do a bonus action to heal somebody. Who's down really bad, can I see Pike?
Matt: You can't see Pike right now, Pike is out of the room.
Laura: Can you see me up in the air?
Marisha: Are you rough? Have you taken some damage?
Laura: Can you see me in the air?
Marisha: Can I see Vex flying off into the distance?
Matt: Currently, roll a perception check.
Marisha: Not great, 14.
Matt: Nope. You do not see Vex, you have no idea where she is right now, you just saw her.
Marisha: I see, I can't hurt him anymore, I see Scanlan, that's all I can really see?
Matt: Scanlan you can see over there, but even then he's too far away for a Healing Word, I think.
Marisha: That's it, that's my turn.
Sam: Well, kill Kevdak, then.
Matt: Pike, you're up.
Ashley: All right, so I'm going to look at the three around me, one of them fell off the roof, so there's only three there, right?
Matt: Correct, there are three, ah. There are five there total, actually.
Ashley: Well, one of them fell the roof.
Liam: You accidentally knocked one off the roof, Matt, five minutes ago.
Matt: That's good to know.
Ashley: There's how many there?
Matt: There's four of them there.
Liam: He's drunk, fell asleep.
Matt: No, it's fine.
Ashley: I'm going to tell them.
Laura: I'm a barbarian.
Ashley: I'm a barbarian.
Matt: There we go. That'll work.
Ashley: I'm going to look at them and I am going to Command all four of them to attack each other. At fourth level.
Liam: And they're all by their allies so they should get advantage on each other.
Matt: Well, technically it doesn't work that way. All right. All right, so. What's the DC on that?
Matt: Spell DC.
Sam: Spell DC.
Ashley: 16.
Matt: That's a failure. That's a failure. That's a 20, so that succeeds. That's a failure. So one of them succeeded, three of them didn't.
Travis: What a call. What. A. Call.
Ashley: Well, hopefully, hopefully.
Matt: So. Does that end your turn?
Ashley: No.
Matt: Your bonus action still, what are you going to do?
Sam: Heal thyself!
Matt: You do still have Spiritual Weapon up if you want to use your bonus action to do that.
Ashley: I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: The Spiritual Weapon can only move 20 feet.
Ashley: Say again?
Matt: It can only move 20 feet as a bonus action.
Sam: Oh, so it can only catch up to him.
Liam: Diagonally. Right on his ass. Yeah!
Taliesin: It flies over objects, too.
Matt: But you can't see him right now, you'd have to move over to have him in view.
Laura: And one of them would get an opportunity now because--
Matt: One of them would, if you were to try and dodge past, yeah. What do you want to do?
Ashley: I have to move anyway.
Matt: It's up to you. What do you want to do?
Ashley: I'm going to try to-- yeah.
Matt: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check as you try to tumble in your armor between the legs of one of the guys in front of you.
Sam: Tumbling!
Laura: You can do it, Pike!
Ashley: I have inspiration?
Sam: Oh, you do have inspiration! And you'll need it, it looks like.
Matt: Whatever your acrobatics is.
Sam: With advantage. With triple disadvantage.
Matt: What is it?
Ashley: 14?
Matt: 14. Let me double-check here real fast.
Sam: Oh, he's going to the book for this. For a somersault!
Taliesin: And isn't this guy technically flanked by enemies now?
Ashley: I mean, I'm not going to somersault, I'm going to sneak around.
Liam: Can't she run under his balls and--
Sam: It's okay, let the DM DM.
Matt: Let me deal with it, guys. You don't want to prod me right now.
Sam: Chapter three  Somersaults.
Taliesin: All that I have and more.
Liam: Matt, you do amazing, every week you do amazing and we're all going to die.
Matt: Let's see the roll there. All right, so you manage to barely push past, but you do trigger a second attack of opportunity to do so. From that guy, that big half-orc there that gets in your way. So that's two strikes against you, that is a natural 20. And that's going to be a 13.
Ashley: Okay, well that misses.
Matt: So that is a pretty low roll, ten points of slashing damage.
Ashley: I'm alive, I'm alive.
Matt: What are you at? What're you at?
Ashley: I am at 15.
Matt: So as you dodge past, get slammed by two blades, you arc around the corner and they're all looking at each other, confused, some of them affected by this magic they aren't expecting, and you rush around and you see in the distance Kevdak, who's now getting shot a couple times, gets set on fire, flames burst up, and he starts screaming out in pain. As you turn the corner, you look over at your Spiritual Weapon, and you can nudge it forward. Right there, its full movement, 20 feet. Go ahead and make an attack with your spell attack modifier. Does not have advantage because he is no longer paralyzed.
Ashley: 20.
Matt: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. So 4d8 plus four.
Sam: Oh wow, that's good.
Taliesin: Oh no, it doesn't fuck around.
Matt: Still halved, but.
Liam: Yeah well. C'mon Sarenrae.
Ashley: Okay. Plus what?
Matt: Plus four.
Ashley: All right, 24.
Matt: 24 halved, to 12.
Ashley: Fuck!
Travis: I know, I forget about it too.
Matt: Yeah, I know.
Travis: I forget about it too.
Taliesin: This is how we all feel watching you fight, by the way.
Matt: So the blade drifts over and in a giant arc swings down with a resounding shining metallic slam. The blade streaks through and cuts this swath, the blade doesn't stop, it passes through and leaves this scar across his body of burned radiant energy. (grunt of pain) Looks over and glares at you from across the open cobblestone of this marketplace, and you see for a second that look that Grog saw that caused him to drop his weapon, you suddenly feel this quake in your soul. This is a powerful entity whose hatred is now bent on you.
Ashley: I can still move a little bit more, right? Because that was only--
Matt: You can if you'd like to. You may take more attacks of opportunity, though.
Laura: What, why?
Matt: In order for her to move further, you might move out of combat with the other guys that are there.
Liam: But they're all attacking each other.
Matt: The Command move means on their next turn they attack each other. Doesn't mean that they're charmed or dominated.
Ashley: But how many feet did I move, how many feet am I able to move anyway?
Matt: That would've been ten feet, you can move 15 more.
Ashley: Okay, I can move 15 more anyway.
Matt: Yeah. But you will take two attacks of opportunity if you move out of range of these two.
Ashley: But wouldn't that be included in the attacks that I just took? If I can move 15 total?
Matt: You can move 25 total because of your tiny feet. You moved ten, you have 15 more feet you can move.
Marisha: Your tiny feet.
Ashley: Should I stay? I'll just stay.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: You need to heal yourself, dude.
Ashley: I know, I know, I know.
Matt: Barbarians are going now. This one picks up the gauntlet and is going to rush over.
Marisha: Fuck!
Matt: And bring it to Kevdak, and he's going to go ahead and hold it there, as Kevdak takes his arm and--
Marisha: Is the arm still in it?
Matt: The arm is still in it, yeah. And he looks at it and takes it with his free hand and clutches it to his chest. And looks around at the other ones, says, "We're going." And he--
Taliesin: Wait, was he holding a weapon?
Matt: Yes, he has no weapons, his weapon was pulled away from him.
Taliesin: I thought someone brought him his weapon.
Matt: Oh, brought the hammer, he brings up the hammer as well, but he doesn't--
Taliesin: But I thought he was hold--I'm trying, yeah, no, I'm desperately trying to give a reason why this couldn't work.
Matt: No, he has no weapon on him currently. He tried to reach for it, but he had no functioning arm at the time. He told someone to pick it up, so someone has your flaming warhammer. These guys here are going to move over here. Move over here. And that one's going to be attacking Pike. Over here, that's two attacks on Pike. That's going to be a 13? And a 14. Rolled really low on that one.
Taliesin: Praise Sarenrae, praise Sarenrae.
Matt: You hear the growl behind you, and without even turning your head, you slam your shield up and deflect one of the blows. Look over your shoulder and glare at it as another one comes down, and this-- you take your mace and swing it in a wide arc over and slam their blade against the stone wall of the side, deflecting the entire attack. As that's happening, both of those guys go forward. Two and a one. Goes up against one of the peasants and strikes and the peasant ducks out of the way and manages to avoid the attacks.
Laura: That's good, that's good.
Matt: This guy here with the giant club goes down and dodges one of the attacks, the other one does come down at 11, yeah, this peasant gets smashed.
Laura: Oh no, was that the little kid?
Matt: No, this was the drunker guy.
Ashley: Well, he didn't feel it.
Taliesin: Died happy.
Matt: All right. That ends their turn, it's the druids' turn now.
Laura: There's so many. They all get to go.
Sam: That's how they all feel when we attack.
Matt: This druid here is going to move forward, seeing you over there, Vax. Reaches out towards you as it only has its 4th-level spells and lower left, because of you, you Counterspell motherfucker. It's going to go ahead and cast Blight on you, Liam. I'm going to need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, as the druid reaches out at you with its hand and says, "Kevdak! Inside!" and concentrates, gripping out. This female goliath, you can see with these thick braids in the back of her head, pulled into a very, very tight braid down to the lower part of her back, reaches out and grasps. You feel the blood begin to pool in parts of your body and your veins turn dark around.
Liam: Now, constitution save, right?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: This is real bad. What is that? That's eight.
Sam: Eight total?
Matt: Total. All right.
Liam: I'm Kate Moss, man.
Taliesin: Don't make that face.
Matt: You take 41 points of necrotic damage.
Marisha: Wow.
Matt: As you feel the energy pulse through your entire body and it's like all the blood in your body momentarily becomes toxic. Your vision blurs and you feel the dizziness hit you and you almost stumble to one knee but you catch yourself against the wall.
Liam: It just halved me.
Matt: That ends the druids' turn. Now the blademongers are going to go. All right. These guys are all going to attack each other.
All: Yeah!
Matt: Except for that one.
Taliesin: Are they not going to attack him as well?
Matt: Well, one of them's going to go ahead and attack Pike, because it was the one that wasn't affected by the Command spell. That's going to be a 19. No? Okay!
Ashley: Just misses.
Matt: And a 13. No. Cannot hit this armored little gnome, who's pushed against the wall, and you're deflecting blows and taking hits against the armor that are denting the front of it, and you're grinning and bearing it.
Ashley: I'm growling! Arrr!
Travis: Arr!
Ashley: Arr!
Matt: These guys are attacking each other now. That is seven-- it hits. They can't hit you but they can hit each other. Two attacks against that guy, and then the other guy. Both hit. So the first guy takes 14. 24 points of damage.
Sam: Are you okay?
Ashley: 15.
Sam: Do you want us to do something?
Ashley: I can. I'm like--
Marisha: Just focus on the mission.
Ashley: Focus on the mission at hand.
Matt: Ends up-- That guy there then also takes 22 points of damage on them. Okay. They start hacking into each other with their blades suddenly, trying to figure out what's happening. And technically another barbarian strikes, so the third one who actually missed you? That would've been an attack against its own guy, because that was the one that didn't hit, so he would've been-- Once again against this guy. So he deals an additional 13 points of damage against one of the other ones. Okay. Got you. So that finishes their turn there. So these guys here are going to move around the fire, this guy's going to move up here.
Liam: Everyone's at disadvantage with me, just a reminder.
Matt: Yeah. This guy here is going to go ahead and move one, two, three. And then using Greenbeard, who reaches out and grabs him with his elemental arm and alley-oops him up onto the roof. With the acrobatics roll. Rolls a one.
Ashley: He dies!
Matt: This guy gets slammed into the side and falls back to the ground, missing his turn.
Laura: Falls right back down like some other loser that I know of.
Matt: Yeah, (laughs). Greenbeard miscalculates and actually slams him against the wall. And then the goliath sort of slides down. Takes four points of bludgeoning damage from that. (laughter)
Matt: All righty. And that guy there is going to go ahead and strike at the child.
Laura: No!
Matt: A three. And 14.
Marisha: Shifty kid, c'mon.
Sam: He's a little weasel, he's a little weasel.
Matt: No, he's going to hit the kid.
Laura: He's a scrapper, he's dodgy. No!
Matt: Kid gets cleaved.
Laura: We didn't save anybody and we killed ourselves.
Ashley: If we kill everybody, maybe I can raise him.
Matt: They're now trying to find a way to draw you out. They're taking turns doing this, keeping, as each person they strike down they look about the rooftops again for more of you. That's going to go ahead, and these guys here are going to go ahead and start swarming over towards the front. This guy here (counting) can't quite get to you, Vax. This guy here, seeing Percy jump down, is going to go ahead and jump down to meet you from behind. See if he makes his. He fails on a two. He falls prone. Takes--
Liam: "I'm coming. Whoa!"
Matt: He takes 12 points of falling damage
Liam: "Ah, help."
Matt: However, he does use the rest of his movement to stand back up and is going to take two swings at you, Percy. That's going to be a 23 to hit?
Taliesin: I'm going to pull my magic shield, actually, I would have to have a 24 AC for that not to hit.
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, I'm--
Matt: Okay. Second one's a natural 20. So the first strike hits you for 12 points of slashing damage. Second strike, double ones on the crit, so that's four, eight points of slashing damage with the second hit. (laughs) I rolled double ones on his crit, that's really frustrating. You're fine with that. All right, that ends their turn, top of the round, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: As you're standing there now, bleeding profusely, holding the necklace that holds Grog, what are you doing?
Laura: I'm going to fly over right above Kevdak.
Travis: How high?
Laura: Like a good 50 feet.
Matt: Yeah, that's 50. All right.
Laura: All right. I'm going to Pokeball Grog right out so he can attack straight out of the gate. Just like I would Cannonball Trinket.
Travis: And I am willing.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Aren't you at death's door?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: I'll say essentially because you held your action last turn, if you wanted to go ahead and take your action to do a drop attack on this point here.
Laura: Can this be my bonus, so I'm dropping him out is the bonus, and then I still can attack? I mean, it's only a locket. It's not like it's a whole move.
Matt: Yeah, I'd say it's your bonus action to do it, yeah.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So, Grog, you were released, falling down to land on top of Kevdak with the bloodaxe in a downward arc.
Travis: And a big windup as we're coming down.
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Travis: Any chance I can make this reckless?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: No! Then they all get advantages against you again.
Matt: Up to you.
Travis: Oh, thank god for that. Natural. 20. Look at it. The first one was a one.
Ashley: Fuck you!
Matt: Ones and twenties, man, you got to stop this. And that's why he did reckless. (screaming and cheering)
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll damage on this.
Ashley: Get 'im, Grog.
Laura: Does that mean he gets the three 12s again?
Matt: With the Brutal Critical at this level, how many extra dice is it for you?
Travis: Brutal Critical is one additional damage die during critical hits.
Matt: But then that's gone up since you leveled previously.
Travis: That's true.
Matt: So you are now at, I believe-- so Brutal Critical, yeah, 13 increases to two. So you roll an additional 2d12 on the attack. So roll 1d12 plus, you're not raging anymore, because you spent the last round.
Travis: That's right, that's three.
Matt: All right, so plus three.
Travis: So ten.
Matt: Ten. Plus two more d12s.
Travis: 12. So that's 22. And a ten. For a 32.
Laura: And then double that? His crits don't get double?
Matt: You only double the first roll.
Travis: Yeah, double the first, right. Which was ten, so 20, so 42.
Matt: 42, brings it to 21 damage. How do you want to do this? (screaming and cheering)
Marisha: It worked!
Liam: Poetic justice!
Matt: As the shadow fires from the necklace as she holds it aloft, bleeding and shaking, you appear, and dive down in silence. The square coming towards you, as Kevdak, clutching in the one nearly ruined arm, the other arm that you bisected, is turning the corner, about to open the door to dive into the house to avoid it, looks up just in time to see you streaking down. What do you do?
Travis: I say  For Strongjaw! And I sink the axe right into his neck and part him perfectly down the middle.
Matt: With the sheer force of the blow, the weight behind it, and the intent, the axe hits him right in the side of the neck, cleaves off part of his ear, shaves off part of his skin here, exposing the jawbone, hits here, breaks the clavicle, tears through, and every single rib is destroyed. It cuts right through the center of this giant body until it gets to about the midsection where it catches, finally. The upper torso splits open and covers you with gore, however, you still impact, not raging.
Travis: Yep. Nope.
Matt: You take--
Sam: He's going to die.
Travis: Don't care.
Matt: 25 points of fall damage from the impact.
Travis: That will put me unconscious and 21 points under.
Matt: And 21 points under. You have that barbarian ability-- Would that be part of this?
Travis: I have Relentless Rage.
Matt: If you drop to zero hit points while raging, you're not raging. So yeah. As you shout, the blow, in a very Superman-versus-Doomsday way, cleaves him in half, and as you slam into the ground, you pull the axe free as your shattered legbones give under and you fall to the ground. You smile as you see his form crumple, and then you (impact) face-first into the ground before him.
Laura: Who's next? Oh, I'm still going. It's still my turn!
Matt: It's still your turn. You watch as every single Herd member in the entire open square gasps at this whole sight. They all turn hearing you scream "For Strongjaw" and see this happen. As Kevdak's body slumps to the ground, it shrinks back down to its average size, and you crumple to the ground, smiling, and fall next to him. And everyone takes a moment of breathless silence. What are you doing, Vex?
Laura: Oh my god.
Sam: Wait, are you dead, Grog?
Laura: He's unconscious.
Liam: He's unconscious.
Laura: I mean, my only option to heal him is to land and touch him.
Sam: He's surrounded by baddies.
Laura: Well. Fuck it, I'm going to land and touch Grog.
Matt: Okay. What's the speed of the broom?
Laura: I don't know.
Matt: It should say on the broom how fast you can move on it.
Laura: Do I have that somewhere?
Sam: You know, in your broom chapter.
Matt: Here we go, I'll find it for you.
Laura: Oh wait, wait.
Matt: Just a moment, guys. Broom of Flying. Speed of 50 feet. So you moved from over here, which would have put you-- it's about 50 to get there. So you could use your action to dash with it, you'd land, that's all you could do.
Laura: I couldn't do anything else? Okay. Then I guess I'm going to stay where I am and-- Jeez. Can I hold my action? I'm going to hold my action until--
Matt: Yeah, it's an action to feed a potion to anyone.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: What are you going to do, Vex? Hurry up.
Laura: I'm going to hold my action until Grog is healed.
Matt: Okay. Okay.
Laura: And I-- can I shout anything?
Matt: If you want to.
Laura: I'm going to shout, witness Grog Strongjaw, and bend the knee!
Ashley: It's great, it's great, it's great.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Laura: Natural 20! (yelling and cheering)
Matt: Don't hit the table, I was going to go inspect it.
Laura: No, I hit, I hit, but it was, it was a 20, I swear.
Matt: No, I trust you guys. I trust you guys.
Sam: It's all ones and twenties. We have these two-sided dice. Just a one and a 20.
Matt: This is going to be an interesting night to explain to the internet, guys. All right.
Liam: You opened it up to the dice, and the dice decided.
Ashley: We witnessed, we witnessed.
Matt: Okay. So. At this point in time, you watch as Greenbeard's form shrinks down and shifts back into his goliath form, still busted, he's looking down at the destroyed, crumpled body of Kevdak, and you there on the ground as well, looking up at you above and hovering. He looks over at the other goliaths nearby here that are rushing in, and they all step out and backwards, inspecting this body. There's a pause, a moment of pause. But they've all paid attention to what you said. That ends your turn. It is now the archers' turn.
Liam: Not me right after Vex?
Matt: I'm sorry, you're up next.
Liam: Yeah. I'm going to use disengage to back a little bit away from them, I'm going to scrabble up the wall-- where's the light, no-- I want to go up by Keyleth.
Travis: You're pointing at the screen.
Matt: So you move around.
Liam: I'm not the first one to do that. And pass her, I want to jump down and land in front of Grog.
Matt: Okay. So you run past there?
Liam: And jump in front of him, between him and-- not Greenbeard, between Grog and everyone over there.
Matt: Okay, so you'd be leaping, technically onto the body of Kevdak is what you'd be doing.
Liam: That's fine.
Marisha: Squish.
Matt: So you land onto Kevdak's form, very angry slash, I'll say for the purposes of this you're there, because Kevdak's body is way too big right now to put on the field.
Laura: But we are so going to loot that.
Marisha: So going to loot that shit.
Matt: All right, you land.
Laura: If we survive this.
Matt: With your hasted movement, make an acrobatics check for the jump.
Liam: That's fine. 25.
Matt: Yeah, you scale up, run, leap, land there, feet sinking into the body.
Liam: And I land on him and I say, Kevdak has fallen. Will you let Strongjaw rise? And I hold my action to attack if they come at me.
Matt: Okay. It's the archers' turn. This archer has its arrow trained on you and is going to hold its action. This archer here is going to move up to see what's happened, dashing to look out and see what happened, doesn't get its turn. This archer here, who's now moved, moves over to this side with its arrow trained on you as well. It's also going to hold its action. And they're all looking at each other at this Mexican standoff moment where they're all poised and ready. Everyone's holding their actions right now. It would be Kevdak's turn, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm pretty far. I'm going to jump down off the roof and move towards Grog.
Matt: Okay, so you run down. Okay. The guy who was up against you has looked over and is not paying attention at this moment. Make a stealth check.
Sam: Oh. Stealth check. 13.
Matt: 13. As you rush down the thing, he looks over, looks at you and goes, "Hey. Hey!" And can't even catch you, you're too fast. Make an acrobatics check as you leap off the roof.
Sam: 19.
Matt: 19. You gnomish three-point-land in this square. You're right next to Pike now, you've landed next to her. As you're around the corner now, you see Scanlan (impact) right next to you.
Ashley: Hi!
Matt: You've got about 15 more feet you can move if you wanted to.
Sam: Move 15 feet? Okay. I will, can I, I can't take her hand and walk too, she can't move right now.
Matt: No, not at the moment.
Sam: Okay, well I'm going to continue to walk.
Matt: I mean, I could say if you wanted to, you could move half your movement and take her with you.
Sam: Okay, I'll do that. I'll take her with me.
Matt: Okay, you take her hand.
Sam: I'm going to use Healing Word, oh shit, what just happened?
Matt: You and Pike move there, holding each other's hand.
Sam: Okay. I'm going to use Healing Word on Grog, and I'm just going to start chanting, Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw!
All: Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw!
Sam: Communicate that as a Healing Word.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll the heal on that. I also want you to go ahead and make a persuasion check.
Sam: Me?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Heal is eight points. What's that do?
Matt: So you go to zero, and then eight.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: And then persuasion check?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Well, I mean, come on.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: That's 23.
Matt: Okay. Good to know. Finishes your turn, Scanlan--?
Sam: No, I have an action still.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: So I will cast Bigby's Hand and lift Grog up 30 feet like a fucking god. (laughter)
Sam: If he's willing.
Matt: I will say for the purposes of this, because I want to do this, this is ridiculous.
Sam: Oh, I had to cast that at level six, by the way.
Liam: Is it full palm-up, or is it Barcalounger style?
Marisha: Is it like a chair?
Sam: You know what, because he's the god and the hand is subservient, it's the back of the hand like this. It's a dainty lift. (laughter)
Matt: I will say Grog is now currently being held aloft right there.
Marisha: Nice!
Matt: As the hand is clutching Grog Strongjaw, lifting him up into the air, you're conscious now as the hand's holding you on its back and you get up from one knee. Grog, it's your turn.
Liam: Pinkie's up?
Sam: Pinkie's up. Tea-time.
Travis: My herd. Hear me. Fallen is your mighty leader Kevdak, the very goliath swine who would have domesticated you like a common household cat, who would have made you bend a knee to a mere dragon. I show you this. And I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull out one of the dragon's teeth that is still in there and I toss it into the middle of the square.
Matt: Clatters to the ground at the feet of one of the nearby bladestorms. It stops at his foot. He looks at it, picks it up.
Travis: I would tell you that under the correct rule, and a return of power to this Herd, dragons would bend a knee to the Herd of the Storm. Where is Zanror?
Matt: They all look at each other and Greenbeard hobbles out, still wounded and hurt, into the center of this area.
Sam: Does he have an actual name or is that just his name?
Matt: Greenbeard's his name.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: Steps out into the middle, looking up at you. "Strongjaw. You stand above us all. In a way." (laughter)
Matt: "Claiming dominion over a herd that you fell to and left behind for years. Though you struck down Kevdak, what do you think makes you aligned with the interests of our people?"
Travis: Oh, you mistake me, Seer of the Herd. I do not mean to lead this herd, but rather to empower you to more powerful game. I'm here to inspire your aspirations. Never would I ask you to bend the knee. Only would I ask you to live and fight and perhaps die in the most beautiful death you can possibly attain. Join me and my fellows. Come to our aid when I call. And with that, we will chase down dragons, gods, and more.
Matt: Make a persuasion check with advantage.
Laura: Come on, come on, come on.
Matt: With advantage on that.
Travis: Fuck. That's only an 11.
Ashley: Can I use War God's Blessing, or?
Matt: I don't think it works for abilities.
Marisha: Can I assist him with a skywrite 'Strongjaw'?
Matt: (laughs) Bing! Strongjaw.
Marisha: I mean a stormcloud above him?
Ashley: Inspo, inspo, inspiration from anywhere?
Matt: It's a little late for that. It's okay. At this point Greenbeard sizes you up from a distance. Everyone else is waiting for a word, you can see everyone is hand on the side of their weapons looking at each other and there's this extremely tense air. Greenbeard turns around and looks to two of the individuals near the front of the building and goes, "Bring out Zanror." And the two of them go inside the door and close it behind them. They step inside the building and there's this long silence. You wait for 30 seconds.
Laura: Can I take a healing potion while they're inside? I'm up on the thing.
Matt: You can, yes.
Ashley: Can I heal Grog?
Matt: Are you going to step up?
Ashley: I can see him.
Matt: You can see him, yeah.
Ashley: So I'm going to cast Heal on him.
Matt: You're going to cast Heal?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: As you begin to go for your holy symbol, you can see two of the warriors behind you twitch for their weapons.
Travis: Hold! It is not necessary. Brothers, look me in the eye. Has the taste of food lost its appeal? Has the zest for life fallen from your hearts? Living in this domesticated dwelling. I promise you this: hear me, and I promise you adventures and glory that is worthy of this herd.
Matt: The door slams open from the front of the Margrave's home. You see as the two individuals come out with chains over their shoulders as they drag out into the center two individuals. You see another half-giant goliath man, one that you've all seen once before on your way to Kraghammer months and months ago. Well. Yeah, about. You see him swollen in the face, bruised, and in shackles, dragged out and thrown to the ground. And the other one holds over his shoulder another chain. He pulls out behind him a half-giant woman with the hair on the sides of her head shaved, one single long mane of hair, and it looks like she's with child. Also in shackles. And she's pushed to the ground with Zanror. Zanror looks up and you can see him closing his eyes like the daylight itself is very bright and he probably hasn't seen light in a period of time. "Strongjaw."
Travis: Cousin.
Matt: "Well. This is a surprise."
Travis: Your face seems a little different.
Matt: It's at this moment that he looks over and glances, and can see the body of Kevdak on the ground for the first time, and then he goes, "You did this?"
Travis: Scanlan. Lower me down.
Sam: I swoop him down. Do you want to be on the ground or just above it?
Travis: On the ground.
Sam: On the ground. But I release him and I make a fist that clenches right next to him. Just in case anything goes bad.
Matt: So. As you're brought down to the ground, Bigby's Hand sets you gently on the cobblestone.
Travis: I take a few steps forward. Yes. This my work. A debt fulfilled after many, many years.
Matt: (sighs) "I fear the Herd's lost its edge. Priorities. My father had grown docile in this place. But he wouldn't be if whispers hadn't found his ears." And he looks over at Greenbeard. Greenbeard immediately steps back and goes, "Look at him in shackles. This isn't a warrior, this is a slave. Both of 'em." Spits in their direction.
Travis: Strange. I would ask, why is he in shackles? What did Zanror do that would draw this sort of ire from the Herd?
Matt: The one that's holding the chains on Zanror pulls them a little tighter and Zanror's lifted up a little bit off of his leaning-forward position, he's now on his knees and his arms are pulled up, in towards his torso. And Greenbeard looks back towards you. "This skyshield here spoke against his father. He was attempting some sort of a mutiny. But we quelled that right quick. Gave him time to think about it. His father was deciding what to do with this traitor. And his next of kin. You, however, seemingly stopped his trial, so I think it's only fitting that you do the honors of finishing the job." And you can see as you were lifted off the ground and everything, you did not have your weapon with you, as you were on the ground, lifted up. Greenbeard steps over and takes the bloodaxe from the ground, walks up to you, and hands it out, and looks over to Zanror.
Travis: I am sorry, Zanror. But I will make it a glorious death. Bring me the gauntlets as well.
Matt: "Let it be." And two of the other individuals, one of the half-orc individuals looks over, hushed, and starts backing away from this, this is too much for him. There's now this tribal tension, this cultural tension that only exists within the initial Herd and has been only recently adopted by the Rivermaw that were absorbed by the Herd and are still confused by this. Two of the goliaths step over and pull and pry out the somewhat soggy leftover arm of Kevdak.
Laura: Kind of like when you're eating lobster, to get the claw out, yeah.
Liam: Shrinks as it leaves.
Matt: They toss it to the ground before you.
Travis: I stand. Put on the gauntlets.
Matt: Kevdak at this point is still being held up by the chains and says--
Travis: Zanror.
Matt: Sorry, Zanror. Thank you. "It was unbefitting of us all to be living under one of those beasts. Under my rule, we were going to take back our power as a people."
Travis: Quiet yourself. I've heard enough. And I lift the bloodaxe and I say: you are a disgrace to this herd and I will return this herd to power. And I pivot, and I drive the bloodaxe into Greenbeard.
Matt: Oh shit! Roll an attack.
Taliesin: Yeah you do, buddy.
Travis: Reckless?
Matt: If you want to.
Laura: No!
Ashley: Get the fuck out!
Laura: It's a fucking natural 20.
Matt: Roll damage.
Sam: We're going to have to get these dice calibrated later.
Laura: But why does it only happen when it's a story element?
Travis: That's an 11.
Matt: Watch as next week Critical Role implements dice cam. (laughter)
Matt: No, that's awesome.
Laura: Oh, let me take a picture, I'll take a picture.
Travis: So that's 15.
Matt: All right.
Travis: And then two more?
Matt: Two more, yeah.
Taliesin: Watch next week as we fail to open the door to his house for an hour and a half.
Marisha: Yeah, yes, can't roll above a five next week.
Travis: That's 27. 37.
Matt: How do you want to do this?
Sam: Oh, you got it?
Matt: (laughs) He had taken a shit-ton of damage in the battle, and was already moving by--
Taliesin: Yeah, he was pretty low.
Matt: He had like 12 more hit points left, so.
Travis: It seems all the poison came from his head, so I'll remove that from his body.
Matt: And with that moment, (swishing), with a very slick snapping sound, the blade coasts through and the neck retreats as the head continues forward and tumbles to the feet as Greenbeard's body takes an instinctual step backward and then falls, lifeless, in the center of the marketplace. All the rest of the Herd moves for a second, nervously.
Travis: I spin and I say  do you see? Do you see what staying in one place does? This is what weakness looks like. I would return you to the wild. I would return you to power. But you will have to do it under this goliath's rule. Unchain Zanror.
Sam: I point Bigby's Hand like he was too. (laughter)
Matt: As Bigby's hand points to Zanror, the two that are holding the chains move up and begin to unchain them both, taking the shackles off his hands and the female goliath at his side. Eventually he stands up, reaches over and puts his arm around her and says, "I am sorry, Worra."
Travis: Worra.
Matt: Worra. She stands and goes, "Do not be sorry. It seems we've been delivered from our judgment." She looks up towards you. You don't recognize her.
Travis: I don't.
Matt: She's not from the original Herd.
Travis: Zanror, she is quite a beauty. Congratulations.
Matt: "You saved us narrowly being executed, Grog." And he stands up and gets to the front of all the rest of the Herd there. "Call forth the rest of our people. We do not leave this town yet. We claim Westruun home for one more night. For it is tomorrow at dawn, we slam our blades against the hide of a dragon."
Travis: No. This is honor. This is pride. This is a life worth living.
Matt: "Will you join us in this glory and pride, fair cousin Grog? You have proven yourself worthy of life and respect and the might of the Herd of Storms."
Travis: How many do you number?
Matt: He looks about and takes in the mental math of all the people that were killed.
Marisha: Yeah, we didn't kill that many.
Matt: I know, you took a few down. "We'd stand, between the people that were loyal to me and my father, a good 43 men strong."
Travis: More than we need. And I grab my earpiece and I go, (meekly) thoughts? (laughter)
Sam: I mean, we have a busy day tomorrow already, I don't know if we should add dragons to it.
Taliesin: We're hunting another dragon.
Sam: Just say yes, we can always leave in the dead of night.
Travis: All right. All this bloodshed is giving me a terrible itch in my ear. We shall stay with you and tomorrow we will bathe in the blood of a dragon.
Matt: He steps forward to you now, there's a slight limp to his walk, but there's too much pride for him to show it as he tenses and reaches out his hands to you and clasps it in his own, Beastmaster-style, holding onto it.
Travis: Yeah, strength and honor!
Matt: "For the dragons, it shall be."
Travis: It shall be.
Matt: He releases the grasp. "Let them walk amongst us as brethren. Come. We have much preparation to do." And he goes back to Worra and limps into her arms, and she takes him up and it's her strength now lifting him on his feet. And the two begin to make their way across the rest of the center of town. All the rest of them take their weapons and they relax, and they still keep a very wary eye of you. The words have been said and there is still this tenuous truce, but they're still coming off the cusp of adrenaline, warfare, and the slaughtering of their previous leader. However, they are going along with the words that were spoken, and there is a look of general fear and respect in their eyes, guarded as it may be. What do you guys want to do?
Liam: I would like to sever the remaining gristle away from his arm that's holding the gauntlet on.
Matt: The gauntlets have been retrieved. And given to Grog, yeah.
Liam: Then I would like to loot Greenbeard's body.
Travis: Could you do me a favor? Could you butcher me a skull of Kevdak, please?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah, yeah. I'm going to land.
Matt: You're going to land, all right.
Laura: And I'm going to call Trinket out.
Matt: Trinket, who's been hiding in the back room there.
Laura: Because things happened so fast for him!
Matt: They did happen.
Laura: And there were really strong people!
Ashley: And I got to go over and heal, yeah. Already healed him.
Sam: I'm going to go over-- are there any remains of the little boy?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Do you have anything that can heal the little boy or bring him back somehow, Pike? Key? Anything?
Marisha: I go and check the little boy. How bad is he? Is he beyond the point of return?
Matt: He's done.
Ashley: Could I--
Sam: Resurrect him or something?
Ashley: I have Raise Dead.
Matt: Do you?
Laura: Does it turn him into a zombie, or does it--
Matt: No, it just raises him from the dead.
Laura: Okay, yeah, do that.
Ashley: Okay. I'll go over to the little boy and see if I can--
Matt: Okay, this will take a while. All right. So, as the rest of herd move on, following Zanror, they begin to separate to gather the rest of the herd throughout the town. A few stay behind, keeping watch--
Marisha: I'll assist Pike in any way that I can.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to sit and fix my gun.
Matt: It's going to cost-- 500 gold are consumed by the casting of this spell as part of the--
Laura: I'll help.
Matt: Okay. Takes an hour. So, as you guys take this time, this is a short rest for those of you who aren't part of this ritual. You complete the ritual. Go ahead and make a religion check.
Laura: Hey, you already boxed up your stuff.
Matt: She was like, I'm done, I'm out. Peace.
Ashley: 20?
Matt: d20, add your religion.
Laura: That's good.
Ashley: 24.
Matt: Okay. Vex, you said you wanted to help. What did you want to help with the ritual on?
Marisha: No, I said I wanted to help.
Laura: She was assisting. I was helping with the money.
Matt: Right, sorry, helping with the money. How are you aiding with the ritual?
Marisha: What? How am I aiding with the ritual?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: What were you doing?
Matt: Well, she was casting-- she was preparing the ritual, preparing seals and taking out the components and praying to Sarenrae and speaking the rites, which channel through her in Celestial language. Although she doesn't understand Celestial, she speaks it through as part of the spell, almost like--
Taliesin: I speak Celestial.
Marisha: I also speak-- no, I speak Primordial. I keep getting that confused.
Matt: Yep. How are you aiding in this?
Marisha: Can place my hand on his chest and place my other hand on the ground and try and use natural healing to assist?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and make a straight wisdom roll.
Marisha: Natural one.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Can I assist?
Matt: How would you like to assist?
Taliesin: I would like to come over and start listening to the chanting that she's doing in Celestial and harmonize and bring a voice to it since I can actually speak Celestial.
Matt: Roll a performance check.
Sam: Performance.
Laura: That's lovely.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: All right. As you finish the ritual, both the voices of Pike and Percy begin to harmonize across these various refrains in a language that, especially when spoken in this rhythmic, ritualistic way, it seems to almost create a third voice. And then you hear, clearly, there is a third voice harmonizing with them that you don't know where it's coming from.
Sam: It's me. I'm off here in the corner. (sings scat)
Matt: As the beautiful musical tones of the singing come to a close, your holy symbol, the glow fades, and a moment passes before you hear the soft coughing of the child's throaty expulsion, himself taking in his next breath of air. He sits up, cradling his head. "What happened?"
Marisha: It's okay. I dump a Cure Wounds in him now.
Matt: It's okay! (laughter)
Marisha: Not a potion! I cast Cure Wounds.
Matt: Okay, okay.
Taliesin: Take it, take it!
Matt: He's like, (choking sounds).
Laura: I cast Grasping Vine and lift him up by the neck.
Liam: Shot right in the chest.
Taliesin: Six years of Celestial, and when are you ever going to use it? It finally pays off.
Ashley: Thanks for helping, Percy.
Taliesin: That was lovely, thank you.
Matt: All right. So the child is brought back to life, healed, confused, dazed, but not really understanding the circumstances around him, just happy to--
Marisha: He heals 24 hit points.
Matt: Yeah, he's good to go. His wounds close, the dried blood's still there, but he seems to be in perfect health at the moment, although a little weak and worse for wear.
Laura: Where's your mother, child?
Matt: "I don't know."
Laura: Was she here in the square with you?
Matt: "No, everything went by so fast. They tried to pull them out, but they found me and pulled me out and brought me here. That's all. There was a fight and a lot of yelling. That's all I remember."
Ashley: Where do you live?
Matt: "Up by the temples."
Laura: Okay. Well, we'll help you find your family. And maybe while we're there we can see if your grandfather's around.
Matt: He smiles a little bit. You can still see the dried blood streaks across his face, but you can see past that to the smile that peeks through beneath his dirty face.
Laura: I lift him up and put him on Trinket so we can start walking.
Matt: Okay. He laughs and Trinket licks him and takes some of that off and he is excited to be grasping something, although he slides a couple times. You can see he's weak from the remnants of the resurrection spell.
Marisha: I give him a boost.
Matt: Okay. Anybody else doing anything for the short rest?
Travis: I would like to not only remove Kevdak's head, just the upper part, no jaw, just the skull, and I would like to use the bloodaxe to flay the skin around the bear tattoo off.
Laura: Is there anything else to loot off of Kevdak?
Matt: I mean, there is the bloodaxe, there is the--
Laura: Gauntlets?
Matt: The gauntlets, and he has four plus-one enchanted javelins that he did not have an opportunity to use this battle.
Laura: (sings) Bag of Holding!
Liam: I already called Greenbeard.
Travis: I'll take the plus-one javelins. And I'd like to put the flayed skin in your refrigerated bag.
Matt: So mark that, mark down in your refrigerated bag, flayed bear tattoo of Kevdak.
Laura: Flayed bear tattoo. Got it.
Matt: That's disgusting. General leather armor, quarterstaff. You do find one potion of greater healing he did not have the opportunity to try.
Laura: Nice. I'm putting that down.
Matt: That's all he has on him.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to spend the rest of the time that they did that ritual gathering up the bodies, the remains.
Taliesin: I'm going to fix my gun.
Matt: Okay. Make a tinkering check.
Taliesin: Just barely. By one point. Did not break.
Matt: Good. All right.
Liam: I'm going to start a fire--
Matt: There's already a fire going.
Liam: Is it?
Matt: Well, it's slower-burning embers now. One of the barricades that had been set fire by the Fireball earlier.
Liam: I'll stoke it, and then put the bodies on.
Matt: Okay, so you take the bodies of the dead villagers that had been lost in the battle and the handful of the other combatants that had fallen, and you throw them onto the fire and it crackles and burns over time. The smell of burning bodies fills the space around it for a while.
Taliesin: We have a house to procure some items from. And a conversation to have with Zanror at some point.
Sam: What time of day is it now?
Travis: Are there any other goliaths in the square that are lingering?
Matt: There are three lingering that are keeping an eye.
Travis: Can I walk over to one?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Tonight we prepare for an incredible battle. Go. Release any meager prisoners you may have kept. They will do nothing for our fight.
Matt: "Very well. These two stay, though. No offense, but you did just kill one of my friends naught but an hour ago."
Travis: I did. And your claim is fair.
Taliesin: These two?
Laura: Who's these two?
Matt: There were three Herd members that were keeping an eye--
Laura: Oh, okay.
Matt: Two of them are goliaths. One of them is human. The human and the other goliath stay behind. The one you talked to walks off and seems to be following through on what you told him to do.
Taliesin: Is it Lord Zanror, by the way? I may request an audience with Lord Zanror at some point. With your supervision.
Travis: Yeah. Have at it.
Matt: Now Thunderlord Zanror.
Travis: Yeah, Thunderlord! I say that in my head.
Sam: We have Pike's dad to find, we've got a house to loot--
Marisha: We've got a child to deliver home.
Matt: Did you want to look over the items you found on Kevdak?
Travis: Oh fucking shit, yes, may I please?
Taliesin: And a unique opportunity to maybe really fuck up a dragon. If we want to be smart.
Matt: There's your bloodaxe. And there's your Titanstone Knuckles.
Laura: (laughs) Bowing down like he's been knighted.
Taliesin: Hm? We have a dragon who's going to go pick up a giant package of whatever we give him.
Laura: Oh shit, you're right.
Taliesin: We could make some interesting decisions on what's in that box.
Marisha: That is an interesting point.
Laura: I mean, do we have to stay in the square, or are we allowed to?
Matt: No. Doesn't seem to be anything holding you there other than the ritual that was done. When the ritual's completed, you're welcome to go about what you're doing. At which point you do see as time has passed, a few people start poking through windows, who apparently were either hiding in some of these buildings, and see you guys and check out and then go back into hiding again. The town still has people living throughout it. Many of them stay hidden whenever things move in their vicinity.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So.
Sam: What's our thing? Do we want to achieve anything else tonight or just rest?
Laura: I feel like we should return this little boy to his family. And see if we can find your grandpa.
Liam: In the short term, we should be able to walk freely, though.
Matt: All right. So, as you guys gather yourselves, partially rested and breathing a sigh of relief at the not horrible circumstance that nearly transpired there thanks to the luck of the gods in a lot of cases.
Laura: I can't believe we're not all dead.
Matt: You make your way northward through Westruun, toward the temple district, small child at your side with the intent--
Laura: On Trinket.
Matt: On Trinket by your side. And possibly to prepare for whatever the Herd has in store for dawn. And with that, we'll finish tonight's game.
Marisha: Now we're going to have to have another huge conversation.
Laura: We didn't die! I seriously thought we were all going to die. When he got healed and everything was running--
Travis: Yup. Yup. I was like, we might as well make it cool, because we're dead.
Liam: We had it, then it flipped and it was gone. And then we snaked it outta the fire.
Marisha: But we had them on the run!
Matt: He, by the way, on that Hold Person, that Cutting Words/Hold Person. Like, that's exactly what that--
Travis: Dude. Yes. Give it up for the fucking bard. Who has an article in Dear Vox Machina.
Sam: Oh yeah, appearing tomorrow.
Matt: Yeah, no. Kevdak hadn't used his action surge yet.
Marisha: What was that?
Matt: Kevdak hadn't used his action surge yet.
Sam: Action surge? What does that do?
Matt: Multi, it's what he does.
Taliesin: What I do, where he can take an extra action.
Matt: He can do four attacks in one round with the bloodaxe.
Sam: Did he ever get to attack?
Matt: No. Couldn't make his save. His arms were gone by the time he came around.
Laura: Oh my god, getting his arms off him, brilliant.
Matt: Plus, he had four more superiority die and the riposte ability. So he could--
Travis: What is riposte?
Matt: When a creature misses him with a melee attack, he can use one of his superiority die to do a reaction attack as well. So he could in theory get five attacks in one round.
Travis: Oh. Holy shit. That's that half-fighter side, right?
Taliesin: That's sexy.
Matt: Yeah, that Hold Person really changed the dynamic really fast.
Liam: We had a very heated discussion over the earring in that 30 seconds, let me tell you.
Taliesin: Well, we had that whole long walk. That was the theory.
Ashley: I think that was the most stressful game I've ever played.
Laura: This was incredibly stressful.
Sam: Pike almost died, Grog died.
Taliesin: I was about to be toast. Two more hits from that guy and that would've been the end of me.
Travis: That was fucking amazing.
Marisha: That was a three-hour battle. We did nothing but fight.
Matt: And honestly, mucking it up with the archers helped too, because they were all about to start focus-firing on whoever was visible.
Laura: Yeah. So I'm glad we split them up. Getting Grog out.
Matt: Getting Grog out was key. If you hadn't pulled him out and taken all those attacks of opportunity? You would be gone. They weren't going to stop when you hit zero.
Travis: No no, that would've been it.
Matt: They were going to cut you up until you were dead.
Travis: Yeah. Yep.
Liam: Look at that guy.
Matt: What?
Travis: I know, look at the face, you saw it too, didn't you? The shadow of a man that wished he could have butchered somebody and didn't quite get to. (laughter)
Travis: The shadow of Craven Edge lives behind those eyes.
Matt: It's okay. Bunch of dudes. You guys have dragons to deal with.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: All right, well, guys, thank you very much for watching. Thanks again for Loot Crate for being awesome and being our sponsor--
All: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: If-- I dunno, if he's still around. Is our guest still around?
Laura: Is he?
Sam: No, there's no way.
Travis: Why don't you mention the Loot Crate link again?
Sam: Oh yeah, we should flash up the Loot Crate link and we'll be tweeting that out later.
Matt: Yeah, it's ww (stammers), www.Loot Crate.com/criticalrole.
Sam: So that's five w's?
Taliesin: And the code is "criticalrole", not "critrole".
Matt: They didn't coordinate with Wyrmwood.
Liam: Missed opportunity.
Taliesin: I got Loot Crate for my little brother. It's his nerd of the month club.
Ashley: It's the best. I have Loot Crate and it's the best.
Travis: Yeah, it's a bash. Every time around we're like, aha!
Marisha: I know, it's like a little present to yourself that you forgot you got.
Taliesin: Also, anything I don't want, I put into a big bin and, at Christmas, I am Santa Claus to all the kids on the block. It's intense. They all want to know what's up with me.
Matt: That's fantastic. All right. Well, in the meantime, we'll be back next week to see what this next chapter in the Westruun portion of this adventure holds. Well done, guys. That's the largest battlefield I've made so far.
Sam: That was an amazing battlefield.
Laura: Good job, Matthew Mercer.
Marisha: Thank you, Dwarven Forge!
Matt: Is he-- he's not here? (groans of disappointment)
Matt: Well, we had the pleasure of having Patrick Rothfuss in the office today to watch the game, so wherever you are, Patrick, pleasure to meet you, and maybe we'll drag you--
Ashley: Big fans, big fans.
Matt: Maybe we'll drag you on the show sometime. Next time you're in LA. So, anyway guys, have a wonderful evening, see you next week, and is it Thursday yet? (cheering) [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: (cheering)
Kevin: All right! (cheers) Welcome! Is my mic on? It's on, whoa, yeah, welcome to the very first inaugural premiere edition of Critical Role live! Guys, my name's Kevin. I am the social media director for Geek and Sundry-- yes, thank you very much, I am indeed a very cool person. I've been with Geek and Sundry for about eight months now, it was really intimidating at first because I kept mixing up Vax and Vex. Yeah, I still mix up Vax and Vex. But okay, what I was going to say was that Critical Role fans are the warmest, most welcoming fans. (cheering)
Kevin: Yeah! Except for that guy. Right? But no, I love you guys, give yourselves a big hand, thank you so much. (cheering)
Kevin: I want you guys to know, this is our first time doing this, this is as I said the first inaugural premiere, they're all synonyms, right? So if you're like me you're extremely excited. But please remember that all the people at home are still watching, say hi to the people at home, hi people at home.
Audience: Hi!
Kevin: Right? So please do me a favor, put your phones on silent, all right? The house lights are going to be kind of dim, so you can use your phones, you can tweet, you can do social media posts, whatever you want, if there's a Cubone somewhere please let me know, tweet at me. I need like ten Cubones. So yeah, just put everything on silent and be silent about it. You can tweet about the show, please use the hashtag #CriticalRoleLive, surprisingly enough. Do me another favor, don't do the concert pic thing where you put your phone up and record for ten minutes at a time, because there are people behind you, as you may or may not know, so I'd really appreciate that. The other thing is, this not a Rocky Horror thing, so don't shout out like, I would like to rage. Don't do that stuff, don't "how do you want to do this?" Don't do that stuff. Be respectful of the people on stage. Think of this as a funny play. You can laugh, you can woo, but maybe don't shout out suggestions. Especially the suggestions that I know a lot of you have in your heads, right? Wait, I have one other thing. There's a merch thing. The merch table's going to be open after the show, is that right? Yes. After the show, the merch table's going to be open, so if you didn't get a chance to get merch, you're going to get another chance to get merch, so don't worry about that. Is there something else? VIPs will get your posters after, so if you're a VIP, you'll get a poster, just come-- where? Upstairs. Okay. Don't worry. Right. Thank you. Let's hear it for Claudia once again, guys. (cheering)
Kevin: All right, so, do you guys want to bring them out? (cheering)
Kevin: All right. Let's start with the master of dick-lightning and shit-scrying, playing Scanlan Shorthalt, Mr. Sam Riegel! (cheering)
Kevin: All right!
Sam: Thanks! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car!
Kevin: Guys, get your tickets to the gun show, because the gun show's coming to town. Playing Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone. Yeah, right, right. Taliesin, let's bring him out, Taliesin Jaffe! (cheering)
Kevin: Guys, put your hands together, put your antlers on your head, for Keyleth. Marisha Ray! (cheering)
Kevin: Is she here? She's so stealthy, I don't understand.
Marisha: I'm an independent woman, all right?
Taliesin: Never mind, I give up.
Kevin: All right, let's bring out the man I have a massive man-crush on--
Sam: I'm already here!
Kevin: Liam O'Brien as Vax'ildan! (cheering)
Liam: What the hell!
Kevin: This next woman was stuffing exotic animals into tiny balls before it was cool. Laura Bailey as Vex'ahlia! (cheering)
Kevin: She's got the hipster glasses to prove it.
Laura: Yeah, that's right. It's not for seeing at all, I don't...
Kevin: And the next guy, the next guy, get out your tubs of mayo for Mr. Travis Willingham as Grog freaking Strongjaw! (cheering and chanting)
Kevin: All right, let's, let's bring it down. Guys, there are certain names that people whisper with reverence. Because those names belong to the breakthrough artists in their field. Jim Henson, Bob Dylan, Madame Curie. (laughter)
Kevin: Tonight we have one of those names with us. You may know him. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Matt Mercer. (cheering)
Matt: Oh boy. That's a lot, that's a lot of people.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Matt: All righty, let me shore up my positioning here on the camera for you fine folks and open my energy drink because that's what makes this show happen.
Travis: Caffeine and drugs.
Matt: (shushing noises) Anyway, welcome everybody to our first Critical Role live, all of you folks there on the internet and everyone here in person in Los Angeles, California. (cheering)
Matt: Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors get together, roll dice, and play Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight we have a fantastic pick-up of last week's story where the adventuring party Vox Machina found themselves wandering through the Feywild. However, before that happens, let us get to our fantastic sponsor for the evening. Once again, this episode is brought to you by Loot Crate, they've been awesome. So thank you guys so much. (cheering)
Matt: The current Loot Crate theme for July is Futuristic, includes a lot of awesome Rick and Morty, Futurama, Mega Man, Valiant Comic stuff, Star Trek, that fun element there. We've got music playing, it's on. Oh man, I feel like things are happening.
Sam: Music's working?
Laura: Music works, you guys, music works.
Matt: There we go. Perfect. Tech stuff is coming together. Yeah, so Futuristic is their crate theme this month. We also have the anime Loot Crate is themed Squadron. Has a bunch of stuff from Gundam, Gate, Arpeggio of Blue Steel, Antimagic Academy, a lot of exclusive stuff, of course you guys can go ahead and get $3 off a subscription by going to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and putting in "criticalrole," one word, in your nice little Loot Crate subscription bonus.
Travis: I chew on Goku's head a lot. I'm a fixated-- it's cool.
Matt: And the paint is actually healthy to eat, apparently. That's not at all the reason why Grog's intelligence is that low. So, if you haven't checked it out yet, check out Loot Crate, thank you guys so much for sponsoring our show, we love you. Great. So. Next up we have-- we recently had a t-shirt contest, didn't we? Laura, if you want to take that away for me.
Laura: Oh, this? Okay, so I get to announce who the official winner is?
Matt: You do, actually, yeah.
Laura: Oh my gosh, this is so exciting. Okay. So the official winner of the first Critter contest is... Against the Chroma Conclave, designed by Antmageddon! (cheering)
Laura: So! As of right now, that shirt is available in the Geek and Sundry store for preorder. It's going to be there for I think two weeks? And it's available in sizes small through 3XL, which we're really excited about. And yeah, so that's that, so.
Travis: Go get one!
Laura: Go you guys for voting on that, you rock, even with shenanigans.
Matt: There were so many amazing contenders for that contest that the community puts out, so we--
Marisha: And we got hacked, which means we made it.
Matt: Yay! Next announcement I have, when I arrived here I discovered that there was an actual PokeGym as a part of this mall, I'd like to ask Team Valor to go ahead and make sure that shit leaves red. (cheering and booing)
Travis: What a response!
Laura: That was a mixed reaction.
Matt: Look, the whole San Fernando Valley's blue, okay, give me something! All right, anyway. Yeah, it's become a thing. And we have another cool announcement. Travis, do you want to take it away on that one?
Travis: Yes we do, the response to this live event was so amazing that we are super stoked to announce that we are going to also be doing Critical Role live in Indianapolis during GenCon on August 6, Saturday night. Tickets will go on sale- I think they're on sale now.
Laura: Right now.
Travis: Right now, so if you want to like, silently on your phone or just ignore it because it's a much bigger venue, so tickets should be available, but we're all going to be in Indianapolis on Saturday night and GenCon to roll some dice with you bitches live. (cheering)
Matt: Hell yeah. So if this wasn't nerve-wracking enough for me, we have another one in a couple of weeks.
Travis: Pressure's on, dude, pressure's on!
Matt: But I'm super stoked, it's going to be my first time at GenCon, I've been wanting to go for many years and this is a nice way to go, I guess. So. Check it out. Hopefully we'll see you guys there. That brings us to the end of our announcements and will bring us down--
Laura: Wait. Before we go into not-regular announcements, should we make sure that people know that we're not having an episode next week because of Comic-Con?
Matt: That's true, actually, yeah.
Sam: Way to bring down the room.
Laura: I'm sorry, guys.
Matt: Because all the company, everyone's going to be at Comic-Con doing panels and scheduling and stuff, there will be no episode next week, but I promise that we'll make the episode the week after that extra cool. (cheering)
Matt: I hope. So yeah, let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Sam: We're on! (cheering)
Matt: All right, all right, we've got to do a story here! It's appreciated, but--
Sam: We should probably just finish.
Matt: All right, so, bringing us in now, back to tonight's episode of Critical Role. Guys, pay attention.
Liam: Illithid syphilis.
Matt: The camera's already on.
Liam: Yeah. Okay.
Matt: So. Our intrepid band of adventurers, Vox Machina, found themselves recently traversing the Feywild in search of another Vestige of Divergence. In doing so, they managed to find an old friend in the nymph Nahla, acquired some information, trading a book, and found their way towards the ever-shifting grasses northward in search of where the Divergence, the object of the Divergence lies. In doing so, they found a new ally, a new friend. A little satyr by the name of, where is it here--
All: Garmelie.
Matt: Garmelie, thank you. Now Garmelie, who had made some really interesting sketches of the party upon being caught was then dragged into Scanlan's magnificent mansion, at which Pike asked him to make a fantastic mural for the interior of that place, which I think still resides there to this day. And on the internet, as we've discovered. Upon traveling further north, hopefully to find their final destination in the form of the Shademirk Bog, where the Fenthras bow seemingly exists, you instead came upon Syngorn, the city from the youthful days of Vex and Vax. Upon speaking to the head-- pardon me; you see, all the nerves gets the belching out. It works out well. Upon encountering Watcher Iova watching the gate, recognizing the twins, let them within the actual city of Syngorn. And that is where we left off. So, as you guys walk through the beautiful verdant city, tall seemingly endless trees around you, many buildings naturally formed and built from smoothly carved stone, various ancient sigils carved throughout the entire cityscape, the very heavy-armored Verdant Guard gathered in places, and a general air of intensity and building military might within the city of Syngorn, you have your invisible companion Garmelie, who at some point in the near future agreed to tell you what it is he wishes you to steal for him as part of the deal that was made by the twins. So. What would you like to do?
Liam: I feel like I should be very stern right now, but I can't stop smiling.
Travis: You're gloomy. Lock it up, here we go.
Laura: I feel like the first thing we need to do is go see our father.
Liam: Right off the bat?
Laura: He's the one that's going to give us access to the rest of the city.
Liam: All right. Is Iova still here, or has she trundled off?
Matt: She's walked off. She literally let you guys in the city and went, do what you've got to do, and then turned away and the rest of the guards--
Laura: Oh seriously, so like... no, no the guard is following us.
Liam: And we remember where we're going, right, because it's all the same as it was.
Matt: The city is the same as it was.
Liam: Well, I imagine we'd go to his home. Our home. His home.
Laura: What time is it? I mean, we don't know what time it is.
Taliesin: It's dusk.
Laura: Thank you, Percy.
Sam: But we just woke up.
Laura: All right. Okay.
Liam: Look at all those elves.
Laura: So many elves.
Travis: Is the little satyr-- is he holding onto my skirts, basically?
Matt: You actually don't feel a general presence, and then as you move you feel a slight tug at your belt.
Travis: Right, so can I like, how far away is that guard that's on our tail?
Matt: About 15, 20 feet back.
Travis: Oh yeah. Can I like super slyly whisper, okay, so at any point are you going to tell us what it is you want us to fucking steal?
Matt: You hear a whispered voice that curls up by your ear, strangely given the fact that he's so small, so the voice is being thrown right into the side of your eardrum, goes, "Just be quiet! Find a place in which we can speak privately, and then I will be happy to tell you. Shh! Stop talking to the air; it upsets them."
Travis: It's really quite normal for me.
Laura: Hey, Grog. You should really watch that gas of yours with him back there.
Travis: Oh, you're so right. Hey, pull my finger. (fart sound)
Matt: (coughs)
Travis: Yeah. That's the family reserve. Oh, he said we're supposed to find somewhere quiet to talk.
Liam: Maybe we should do that first, actually.
Laura: We have guards fucking following us. We have to go find our father.
Taliesin: We also don't know where we're sleeping tonight, or whether or not it's even permissible. We should probably have a conversation with whoever's in charge. Is your father in charge?
Liam: No.
Laura: Ish.
Taliesin: Ish.
Liam: He's a bureaucrat.
Taliesin: Excellent. (laughter)
Liam: All right, let's go see Dad, then.
Marisha: (whispers) Grog.
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispers) Your pants, they're sagging a little bit, why?
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispers) They're sagging.
Travis: Oh, it's like the new rage amongst the kids. It gives me super street cred.
Marisha: Where's Garmelie?
Laura: Keyleth, shut up about Garmelie!
Travis: Yeah, ix-nay on the Garmelie-- I think I'm doing Pig Latin wrong. Yeah.
Liam: It's this way. And I start walking off towards Dad's house.
Taliesin: I'm going to follow the twins.
Sam: Sounds good.
Marisha: I look regal and as we pass elves I say, good day.
Matt: The few that look in your direction, Keyleth, take a moment to nod, look you over and then continue walking, seemingly perturbed by the sudden interaction and the immediate realization that you're not of full blood.
Laura: Yeah, sorry Keyleth, your ears aren't large enough.
Marisha: That's not normally what people tell me.
Sam: It's not the size of your ears...
Marisha: That's right.
Matt: So. As you guys continue following Vax'ildan towards the abode of their father, you keep an eye out towards the rest of Syngorn proper. You see the further into the city you go, interspersed with a few Emon guards, you see a handful of individuals that are human, and they're dressed in the actual attire of the guards of Emon, and they're intermingling right now with the Verdant Guard, the military might within Syngorn.
Marisha: What were the name of the guards in Emon? Did they have a name?
Matt: The Emon guard.
Marisha: Yeah, totally.
Matt: There is a name, and it's somewhere in my notes but we're good.
Taliesin: From this perspective, I can see your panic folder. It's so exciting. That's where the magic happens.
Marisha: Yeah, that's true, we never really see that!
Taliesin: This is exciting for us. (laughter)
Matt: So. You guys continue making your way towards the abode. After traversing on the outskirts of what would be the tangleward side of the city, the eastern side, you travel in through an area of buildings that are very beautifully crafted, many of which seem to have stemmed from some sort of a tree growth, but upon closer look you can see that it's actually carved stone to resemble a tree. And then it eventually rises up into a somewhat spherical building, and there are many that build off of that to create this kind of neighborhood of various elven abodes within Syngorn.
Liam: Fucking hate this place.
Laura: Me, too. It's hideous.
Marisha: This is gorgeous. Look at the craftsmanship. It's incredible.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day.
Matt: You make your way towards the end of this particular-- (laughter)
Matt: The guards still keeping track behind you. You find your way to the end of the main road, and it splits into two smaller avenues. You know to take the left that leads deeper into the more political family houses of Syngorn. While your family is not a political house per se, your father, as an ambassador to Emon, was given a home in this location. It is your old home, although it appears to have been even further renovated and is much nicer than you remember, but the door is closed and the dusk sun leads you to pause as you look upon the outside of this abode you have not seen in many, many years.
Sam: Do you want me to burn it down?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: No, just seriously, you seem super gloomy. Are we getting in a fight?
Laura: No. No fights.
Matt: The guards now step up and flank a little bit, keeping a close eye as you've now approached and effectively knocked on the handle of a relatively middle-to-high-ranking individual within Syngorean society. Eventually the door opens and you see a woman standing there: bright blonde hair, braided and tied up in the back. She's wearing more of a work-gown for the day. You recognize her as Devana, the new wife of Syldor, the one that you had once met before in Emon when you guys came upon your father last time. As the door opens up, she looks out for a second, taking in the whole group that has gathered on the outside of their home and goes, "My god. Vax'ildan, Vex'ahlia, we weren't expecting you!"
Laura: No. I can't imagine you were. Is he here?
Matt: "He is."
Laura: What time is it?
Matt: She glances out, looks up. "That's always a good question. The longer we stay in these realms, the more confused my daughter becomes."
Liam: How long has that been?
Matt: "Weeks now, I assume. Best that our timepieces can keep."
Laura: Is Velora around?
Matt: "She is, would you like to see her?"
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "Come in. Is it just you two?"
Laura: No.
Liam: No.
Laura: It's everyone.
Travis: Hi.
Laura: And Trinket, you remember Trinket.
Matt: (bear noises) Nudges your arm to the side and comes forward and sniffs out to Devana. She shrinks back a little bit and reaches her hand out to the nose and taps the edge of Trinket's face, and Trinket licks her fingers.
Marisha: Good day.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day. They respond better if you say "good day" and if you have your head up.
Travis: If we say "bidet?"
Marisha: Bidet, yes. Good day.
Travis: Bidet.
Taliesin: So close. So very close.
Matt: The two guards closest to you, within their helmets their eyes narrow, they look at each other and shake their heads.
Travis: Oh, bidet.
Liam: Your accent is perfect. Don't change a thing.
Matt: Devana goes, "Very well. If you would all proceed to be quiet if you could, Syldor is working. And you may stay outside," she says to the guards. And they both, "We were given orders, milady, to--" "I understand that. But this is already a lot of people in our home. Stay close within earshot, it'll be fine. I trust them." The guards, (sighs)
Laura: I wink at them as I walk inside.
Matt: No reaction whatsoever. You guys make your way into the home and are immediately caught with a very strong smell of cedar. It's a very pleasant-smelling home, and the hearth is warm. It's everything you wanted your home to be, and it immediately hits you to walk in here and see this kind of life away from a life, seeing elements of it that remind you of your childhood, things about it that flag memories to your head of good times and bad, in just a few mere moments. And at that same time, there's a sadness because so much of it has changed, so much of it seems better than the memory. And for a moment there, you feel a little tinge of wondering how different it might've been. At which point that thought process is broken as Devana steps in and goes, "Would anyone like tea, perhaps?"
Sam: Sure, yes, do you have an oolong?
Marisha: Maybe a chamomile, it would be great.
Matt: "Something like that, yes. It's been a little scarce in the Feywilds. More difficult to farm herbs here than you'd think."
Marisha: Oh, here. I pull out some herbs that I brought from my garden. Some glisfoil and other things.
Matt: "Thank you. Appreciate that."
Marisha: They won't scream at you when you pick them. Good. It's good.
Matt: "Thank you. What was your name again?"
Marisha: Oh, I'm Keyleth of the Ashari.
Matt: "A pleasure to meet you again--"
Marisha: Good day.
Matt: "That's, that's really not necessary in my home. You, sir, your name?"
Taliesin: Whatever's available would be just fine.
Sam: I think she means your name.
Marisha: I think she means your name.
Matt: "That's a curious title."
Marisha: But you can call him whatever's available, as well.
Matt: "Very well, coffee table. What's your name?" (laughter)
Liam: It's easier than the actual name.
Taliesin: For you, it is just Percival, and I am another visiting royal from man's world.
Matt: "All right. You, sir?"
Sam: I am called the Kingslayer, Chuck Norris, Burt Reynolds. I have many names. You see, when you've traveled a road as long as I have--
Matt: "Black tea, got it. And you, sir, the large one?"
Travis: Oh, yeah. Bidet. The name is Grog.
Matt: "Very well. I'll return with Syldor once he knows you're here. It may be a while if you don't mind waiting, but the tea will come out posthaste."
Laura: And Velora? Where's she?
Matt: "Let me get her for you, she'll be very like to see both of you, she asks from time to time." She brushes a little lock of hair that's fallen in front of her face behind her ear, and smiles and darts off towards the kitchen. A few moments pass with you guys sitting in awkward silence, looking about the space in the vicinity. Looks to the twins. Eventually Devana comes out and sets tea for all of you across the central table in this meeting area, and behind her you see, clutching the edge of the skirt, you see this tiny, long brown hair that is braided, but the braid's coming undone, tomboyish looking elven girl that peeks around the side of her dress and hides again behind the back. [high-pitched noise]
Matt: Welcome back, sorry about that. (cheering)
Sam: What a battle!
Matt: The technical aspects. We're working through it, but we got through it, thank you for your patience. So the last few minutes, we're not quite sure how much you guys may have missed, but the party wiped. We're rolling up new characters. No, for the Monday episode we'll go ahead and make sure to splice in anything that may have been missed for the past minute. But the party had come to the home of Syldor, the father of Vax and Vex. They had a brief discussion with Devana, his new wife. They were given tea after introductions and then briefly discussed the merits of being a warrior with their half-sister Velora Vessar, and upon discussing apparently a war of some kind, Syldor made his way into the room, and you look and you see the long dark hair of Syldor, his pale complexion, his stern face, staring back at you all from within the doorway as he closes it behind him and steps into the room. You see Devana sits up now and comes over to him and says, "My dear, would you like us to leave you alone?" He goes, "Don't worry, it will be fine. Have a seat. Besides, we're all family. Well, some of us, at least." And he looks over to Grog.
Travis: Bidet. (laughter)
Matt: "Good day, indeed." He comes up and sits, and he's wearing long, dark brown robes with golden and red embroidery on the side, but it's very casual home wear, and he sits down, pulling up a chair across from you guys in this area, and takes one of the cups of tea and sips it. And you can see there's an intensity to his face. He's here, and he looks like he's partially inconvenienced by your presence like he always did, but he also looks like he hasn't slept well, there's some dark circles under his eyes and he seems a little distracted for such a climactic re-meeting.
Laura: Surprise!
Matt: "Surprise, indeed. So. It's good to see you both. Glad you're in good health. You've come quite a ways to come speak with me, being as we currently reside within the Feywild."
Liam: It's a little bit further than we thought we'd have to travel, why... the presence around the city we're seeing? We understand why you fled, but what's going on?
Matt: "Look. We had the entire Fort Daxio army down here and we were to give aid to push into the nearby mountain range where apparently there was an influx of lizardfolk, had been a continuous problem, and apparently a break had been seen somewhere. However, we had sent most of our forces into the mountain range and then received word that three great drakes were making their way straight toward Syngorn after the destruction of Emon. Knowing that, we had no recourse but to flee and prepare when it was time. Had we stood our ground, we would be the same burning crater that your fair city is now."
Laura: So you intend to go back? You're amassing this army to go back and join the fight.
Matt: "That is exactly what we're doing. The remnants of the Emon army we currently have here in the city, we've been building armor and weapons to make sure the most sure-footed and strong-of-arm men and women of our fair city can make it to that battlefield and tear that beast down."
Laura: That's wonderful news.
Matt: "Good. Why are you here?"
Taliesin: We are here on a very similar range of business, to be honest.
Matt: "And you are?"
Taliesin: Ah, yes. Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III of the royal house of Whitestone, representative of man's world, here on very important business dealing with dragons. We are looking for some objects: a few things that may help us in our fight against these dragons that have attacked us. We've already made headway against them, and we've already made headway on our quest to destroy them. Any help that your wonderful city could provide would be most agreeable.
Matt: "Well. We currently have all of our resources engaged in our plans of attack. There is not much we could offer you other than, if you wish to stay here within the city, we could provide a place to sleep, food, and when the time is right you may join our ranks into the fray."
Liam: We've come to the Feywild for something specific.
Marisha: We're trying to head to the Shademirk Bog.
Matt: "Why on earth would you be heading to the Shademirk?"
Marisha: We're looking for the bow of Fenthras. It supposedly lives inside of a cancerous tree.
Matt: "Right. Well. Good luck with that."
Laura: Do you think it's possible?
Matt: "I think it's a fool's errand to chase a fleeting rumor into a location that is known to devour and destroy anyone who steps within its bounds. But by all means, you've always been ones seeking the darkness."
Liam: He and I are wearing fleeting rumors. That one's got one hidden up his butt. (laughter)
Matt: You hear Velora chuckle. Devana's like, "Shh! Quiet!"
Laura: I want to pull Velora over and sit her in my lap.
Matt: She (raspberry noise) at her mom as you pick her up there. You can see Devana smiles as she does so.
Liam: Syldor, we have killed two of these dragons already. Nothing could please me more to hear that you are amassing forces here to go back; that is possibly the greatest thing I've ever heard you say to me.
Laura: I want to insight check him and see if he's really saying--
Travis: Yeah, do that shit!
Matt: Roll an insight check.
Liam: Him or me?
Laura: 26 on him!
Matt: All right. I'd whisper, but the microphone makes it useless. It's fine. He appears tired, he appears like a lot of his intention and time has been put towards something important--
Laura: Being a giant dick?
Matt: Possibly. But he doesn't appear to be lying or fudging the truth at all, he's just tired. He says, "Look. There are a lot of pieces at work here. If you have your own path, by all means. And while I have heard of some of your exploits, and I am quite impressed, I hate to be blunt, but it's difficult and strange to mingle family new and old. Your presence here brings up difficult memories for me."
Laura: Oh, you poor man.
Liam: Don't worry. We're not here to look for family. That would entail some amount of investment on either our side or yours. There is clearly none. We are here to do business. Do you know where the bog is?
Matt: "Yes. It's duskward of here."
Sam: Duskward.
Travis: Fucking shit.
Liam: Well, some people go this way, and some people go that way, and some people go both ways.
Marisha: It's like being on a ship forever.
Matt: "I have not traversed this land extensively. I've been here working along with the heads of the city to make sure we are ready for this attack."
Laura: When do you plan to attack?
Matt: "A few weeks."
Laura: You're joining other armies. You don't plan to fight Thordak on your own?
Matt: "Well. There is an attempt to join up with the remnants of the Fort Daxio force. They have not gone to Emon themselves and they currently reside camped out near where Syngorn usually is. We have a few groups that are set on the other side of the veil in the prime realm and they are keeping an eye out for this. A few scouting parties are in Emon as we speak, trying to gather intel on Thordak himself. Once we have that information and we can formulate what to expect, then we can attack."
Marisha: So you're trying to go after Thordak himself. That's your first target, Thordak?
Matt: "He's currently the largest threat to our safety, our home, and our return. Don't think this is the first time a red dragon of that size has been felled. There have been ancient ages of various deaths from his people. It's not impossible, but we need to be ready."
Travis: Just a heads-up, pro tip  dragons can fly. (laughter)
Matt: "And I take it you're their leader."
Travis: Of the dragons? (laughter)
Matt: He very slowly sighs while grabbing his tea.
Travis: I've clearly lost your father. It's all right.
Laura: His intelligence is very low, Grog.
Taliesin: In the interest of dealing with Thordak, we are going to need access to libraries, any of your people who may know something about this bog, and accommodations befitting those of us who are titled.
Sam: As well as access to certain parts of the city. We need some items to acquire within the city before we set out.
Marisha: Also, it would be nice to find shelter for those of us who are not titled.
Sam: And I had asked for an oolong tea. (laughter)
Sam: This is more of an assam, I would say? A black tea.
Taliesin: This is technically what you do, though, isn't it?
Matt: Devana says, "I'm terribly sorry, I didn't mean that--"
Marisha: No, not you.
Matt: Syldor crosses his fingers together and, "I can give you a letter that will grant you entry to a few of our general storehouses. However, most of you are outsiders and others have been ostracized in their own right."
Taliesin: But you will respect titled entry. Those of us who are court can converse with court.
Matt: "Your title, your court, is unfamiliar with me. I doubt it will hold sway within this town, this city, this entire realm. But you speak of great importance, are you the leader of this troop, he who brings up words of courts and titles?"
Taliesin: For the moment, why not? I will say, I know the Feywild by reputation, and by reputation you are known for your manners, and any kingdom should be measured by manners as the currency that is the easiest to come across.
Matt: "Manners, by the way, are extremely effective in times of peace. This is not one of those times. However, I appreciate that you at least acknowledge the way things sometimes work. So. Daughter. Son. What else do you need of me?"
Liam: Honestly? Nothing.
Laura: We don't need or want anything from you.
Matt: "Yet you still came to my home."
Laura: Oh, well. Yeah. We got what we wanted, which is access to the city.
Liam: We're not here to be friends or rekindle anything, but it seems like we want the same thing, in a roundabout way. We want to end these dragons. We want to return the world to what it once was. Any help you can give in spite of our past, in spite of all the bullshit between us will be appreciated by more than just she and I.
Laura: We know you have no love for us. Think of those you do love. And I hug Velora. Don't you want to make her safe?
Matt: "That's exactly what I intend to do. If you wish to help in that, then so be it. I'll pull what I can within the city. (sighs) Just leave me to my business, please." You see for a moment there, for all the facade, all the front that he puts up, that strong distance facade, you see the fatigue break through, and there's a, like a dark heartbreak. "This is a greater threat than we've ever faced in our lifetime, and many of those in this city have lived quite a while. We have to do things right. Don't be foolish. Too many lives have been lost at the hands of these dragons, some closer than others."
Laura: Do you know of anyone that has traversed more of the Feywild, that would know of what we might expect?
Matt: "One who's seen the most would be the High Warden. I could probably get you passage to see her, but you're going to be heavily guarded." You guys do know the High Warden, Tyrelda is her name, and she is actually of the bloodline of Gynlara who founded Syngorn centuries ago. She currently is essentially the de facto leader, though in terms of public, she is the final decision-maker on most of Syngorn's political and social endeavors. "Will that suffice?"
Liam: It will.
Laura: It will.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day. (laughter)
Matt: "Curious manners, your friends." He takes his tea and pours another cupful, and leans back in his chair. "Two dragons you say you've killed."
Liam: That's right.
Laura: More than that, isn't it?
Travis: Of the Conclave.
Laura: Of the Conclave, we've killed two.
Matt: "Which ones?"
Laura: Umbrasyl. And. What was the other one?
Liam: Blitzen?
Laura: Blitzen, Donner? What was the name of the other one? Oh, it was General Krieg!
Marisha: Yeah, that one.
Laura: The blue one.
Marisha: And then we've also killed a white one.
Sam: We thought so little of him we didn't even remember his name. (laughter)
Liam: Brimscythe?
Marisha: Brimscythe. That's the one.
Sam: But also we respect him enough to learn his name.
Matt: "Well, your story has charm. I have to admit, I have gotten word of at least one dragon felled on the other side."
Marisha: I pull out a dragon's tooth from Umbrasyl out of my pocket and I toss it to him. That's the result of the doings of your children. You should be very proud.
Matt: "I am proud. I. Am proud. But the city lives differently. Understand the difficulty that your presence puts upon our family with you being here. I mean no disrespect, and it's fine in this trying time. But while you two may have undergone much ridicule in your youth, I saved you from the brunt of it."
Laura: You-- headphones, dear-- you fucked some random woman in a city you passed through, and you expect us to feel sorry for you?
Liam: You should've left us to be with our mother when she died!
Laura: Why? Why pull us away from her if you had no love? We would have been happy with her.
Matt: "Because I had hope that you would be worth more, given that you had my blood in your veins, than to waste away in some small hovel."
Laura: If I could pull the blood of you from my veins and give it back, I would. I want no part of you.
Matt: "There are many things we wish for but we have no choice but to take what we are given and make the best with what we have. Even with this rift, there is still a part of me that cares for you both and is genuinely happy that you live. And that you rise. And that you prove what the rest of these fools in this city said you were incapable of. Yes, I am prejudiced. But I still fight it every day. And I'm not going to lie, every time that my daughter, your half-sister, laughs and plays stealthy Vax and Vex on her own, it makes me smile. You inspire those outside of our city walls with your doings. I think that's rather large of you. As foolish and as damned deadly as some of these endeavors may be, you inspire. That's more than I've done in my lifetime. So. Care not what I think. Care not how your mother died. Just avenge it. For both of us. Show your little sister that you can rise up and destroy whatever comes in your way. Hate me all you want. It's only half-scorn from me. I live with my regrets. I tried to bring you up right. But that upbringing was not right for you. And by the time I tried to return you, it was too late. I'm sorry. That's all I can say." Devana goes, "Anyone want any more tea? Oolong, you said."
Sam: You got it!
Matt: "Right, yes." And she leaves, awkwardly.
Travis: Just so you know, what they did against the dragons was incredible. All of the rest of us were like, "Ah! Oh, we're dying! We don't have anything we can do!" And then they were like "Kill! Stab!" And then--
Marisha: Percy! No, don't die!
Taliesin: What are you doing?
Marisha: I'm being blood out of your jugular, just go with it.
Travis: And then they killed them all! It's the only reason we're alive, really.
Sam: It's true. Vax wanted to go inside the dragon, I was like, no! No, let's do it! (laughter)
Sam: Cut his way out, went back and saved me. Crazy.
Matt: "That does indeed sound quite crazy."
Travis: I mean, the balls on this one-- this one.
Matt: "Let's be honest, Grog. They both have--"
Travis: Lord Grog Peanut Butter of Strongjaw. I'm titled.
Matt: "I'd say they've both proven to have more balls than most of those in our city."
Liam: Look, we're never going to be a happy family.
Matt: "No. That is right."
Liam: But if you want to make reparations, help us on our path. It will only help you on yours.
Matt: He stands up from his chair and walks his way back to his study and closes the door behind him.
Laura: Well, fuck. Guess he's not into us now.
Travis: I thought we weren't getting in a fight!
Taliesin: No, this is good.
Sam: Do you want me to take a dump somewhere?
Taliesin: Not yet.
Laura: Oh, headphones, darling.
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Matt: She pulls your hand down, looks at you, says, "Take a dump!"
Laura: Oh, shit. I mean, shoot!
Matt: "I like him."
Sam: That's gnomish. Doesn't mean the same thing.
Matt: She's now transfixed on Scanlan.
Laura: Darling, he takes blue sparkly poos!
Matt: "Blue sparkle poos? Can you teach me?" (laughter)
Sam: Do you have any blueberries?
Matt: "I'm going to ask my mom if we've got blueberries."
Travis: Holy shit.
Matt: She runs off to the kitchen. A few minutes pass, and Devana comes out holding the tea on the cart and goes, "Who taught my daughter to say 'blue sparkly poo?'"
Laura: I don't know what you're talking about.
Marisha: Is that a swear word?
Laura: You should really control the people in this city from talking about that, because it's weird.
Sam: She got it at preschool.
Taliesin: So many soldiers everywhere.
Matt: "Velora, go to your room."
Marisha: I've never heard a soldier say, "Ah, blue sparkly poo!" I feel like she didn't get that from a soldier.
Taliesin: You've never really been in war, have you?
Matt: The door opens from the far study, and you see Syldor walk back in holding what looks to be a rolled-up piece of paper with a seal on it. He heads over and tosses it onto the table. "That will grant you passage through the city. That will grant you a single meeting with the High Warden. That's the most my power can do at this time."
Laura: This is a belt buckle, why are you passing me this?
Liam: (stage-whispering) We're playing pretend.
Laura: Okay, oh, it's a sealed scroll now.
Taliesin: May I see that really quickly? Don't throw it! Pretend!
Marisha: Pretend. I'm pretend handing it off.
Sam: Ooh, good object work.
Liam: Now get in the canoe!
Laura: Yes, yes.
Taliesin: Right, they're all elves. I can't look at them.
Sam: Oh, it flew away!
Taliesin: This grants an audience for all of us, then?
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: You're going to have to amend that one name, though, just to be fair. It's Lady Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "Lady?"
Taliesin: Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt. (cheering)
Taliesin: So good sir, despite your relationship with her, do watch your manners.
Sam: Tea spit take!
Matt: "My apologies, Lady Vex'ahlia."
Laura: Well, you didn't know. (laughter)
Matt: You can see, there's confused surprise, but a smile does curl across the corner of his mouth. "I will make the amendment immediately." And he stands back up, takes it from Percival and makes his way back to the room.
Liam: Darth Vader.
Matt: He returns, hands you the amended paper. "Good luck."
Laura: This is a belt buckle-- oh. (laughter)
Matt: It's a gift from your mother.
Travis: You should thank Percy.
Matt: "If you do intend to make your way towards the Shademirk, be careful. Be safe. And if anything comes your way that you feel you are incapable of handling, run. We don't need heroes right now, we need survivors."
Travis: No promises?
Matt: He shoots you a very dark look.
Travis: Right. Sorry. The House of Peanut Butter will continue its bloodline. I don't know.
Matt: "I will send word. Where can I send word to retrieve you when the time is ready for us to attack?"
Sam: Do we have accommodations in the city?
Laura: Yes, but we'll be in Whitestone.
Matt: "I will send word to Whitestone when we plan to return to the Prime Material, and preparing our forces for attack upon Thordak in Emon."
Marisha: If not, reach out to Allura of Emon.
Matt: "I know Allura well, and I can reach to her."
Marisha: I had a feeling you did. (laughter)
Sam: Are you hitting on their dad?
Matt: "Anyway."
Marisha: Does everything look like hitting on people to you, Scanlan?
Sam: It does.
Matt: It's the Scanlan filter. It's on Snapchat.
Marisha: Take off the beer goggles, take them off! Those are plus-two magical beer goggles. Take them off!
Matt: He stands up and at this point Devana enters beside him, puts her hand on his shoulder. He looks to you with his hands crossed before him and goes, "I wish you luck and safe journeys. I appreciate you coming by. It was good to see you both."
Liam: Where did our sister go?
Matt: Turns and Devana goes, "She's in her room for using bad language."
Laura: Poo is a really terrible word to say, I think. Good thing she didn't say any of the other words that she heard in here.
Matt: "Hold on." And she leaves and comes back, this time pushing Velora from the back, and Velora walks up pouting with her arms crossed, holding her little owlbear under her arm.
Liam: Come here.
Matt: She runs up and gives you a big hug. "Are you leaving?"
Liam: Yeah, just for a little bit, though.
Matt: "You just got here!"
Liam: I know. Listen, do me a favor? Keep scraping up those knees, will you? You crawl anywhere you want in this city, the higher the better. And listen to your parents some of the time. But not all of the time.
Matt: "I can already do that."
Laura: Oh, and!
Matt: She gives you a little kiss on the cheek and then runs up and puts her arms around you and almost pushes you back, she's bigger than you remember.
Laura: She is. I pull out one of my owlbear feathers that I picked up with Zahra and I tuck it behind her ear.
Matt: "What's this?"
Laura: It's an owlbear feather. I know! (laughter)
Matt: She steps back down and looks at her little plushie and--
Laura: You keep that behind your ear, and you wear your necklace, and you never forget that Vex and Vax love you very, very much, dear.
Liam: Listen to us. You are not our half-sister. You are our sister.
Matt: She runs up and hugs you both, one in each arm, and then steps back down. "Thank you. Come back soon, please!"
Laura: Of course, come visit me in my baroness... isity.
Matt: She runs back to her mom's side and looks at her mom and goes, "Poo." (laughter)
Matt: Devana rolls her eyes and goes, "Ugh. Thank you. So much."
Liam: Shit's a good word, too.
Matt: Covers her ears.
Travis: Are we doing that now? Penis wiggle! (laughter)
Matt: You see Devana's looking cornered, it's like, (shushing noises). Syldor actually starts laughing. "I hope that's good day, then!"
Sam: Good day.
Laura: Good day.
Travis: Bidet.
Marisha: Good day.
Taliesin: Good day.
Matt: "Good day." And Syldor bows, you all slowly leave the door, and right before the door closes behind you hear a little voice go, "Shit." (laughter)
Matt: "No!" The door closes.
Marisha: We're those terrible-influence side of the family, aren't we?
Laura: I run up and I give Percy the biggest hug. Percival!
Taliesin: It's the gift of smugness, it never goes away.
Laura: Wait, is it real-- no. Was it all just to--
Taliesin: No, I actually, it occurs to me that we did kill two of the three barons of Whitestone the last time that we were there. (laughter)
Taliesin: There's no house and there's no money--
Marisha: It's the one Scanlan burned.
Taliesin: It's the one that Scanlan burned.
Sam: Oh, you're the lady of the house that I burned down.
Taliesin: And there's just a crypt and that's being used for other things, but--
Marisha: But you have a title!
Taliesin: But you do have a title, at the very least. And once a year, you have to do something ridiculous.
Laura: Even so, Percy.
Taliesin: You're welcome.
Laura: I thank you so much.
Taliesin: Use it in good health.
Travis: I lean over to Scanlan and I say, did you notice that their dad was saying "bidet" wrong?
Sam: I did. I did.
Travis: I thought he was like a highfalutin type.
Sam: You should just say it even louder to make sure people know the correct pronunciation.
Travis: I know. We could be a force for good in and outside of the city. Bidet!
Sam: Bidet!
Matt: The guards that are waiting for you outside of the house just sigh very loudly. (sighs)
Travis: Change is hard.
Matt: All right, so you have your parchment. Within the next half-hour or so it's not difficult for you guys to go ahead and find sleeping arrangements for the evening within Syngorn. You're met for the most part with standoffishness and curiosity with your approach, but upon showing the paper there is a sudden realization and a formality that is brought to the conversation, and it's, you can't help but enjoy it, the two of you. You haven't walked through Syngorn and been forcing people to show you the respect you've always wanted, and there is something slightly cathartic about that. But you manage to find accommodations for the evening's rest. The guards proceed up into the secondary floor where your room is kept. Will not enter the room, but notify you that they will be staying outside of the doorway to ensure that both you are protected and that you don't do anything crazy in the night.
Travis: What?
Laura: That's stupid.
Marisha: We're respectable.
Taliesin: It's adorable that they think they could stop us if we tried.
Marisha: I know! Are we all in rooms next to each other, are we in one room?
Matt: It's a series of rooms within what looks like it was at one time a military barracks that has since been renovated. It's not really an inn or tavern; there aren't a lot of travelers that come through Syngorn that don't actually live there or have a home, so it's more being used for storage, but they cleared out an area and they put up beds and it looks-- Syngorn storage room is pretty nice by the standards of like Kymal or Westruun, so it's not too bad.
Taliesin: There's some art nouveau happening. That's all I can really ask.
Marisha: Have they already locked us in our rooms?
Matt: No, you've just gotten to your rooms now, so.
Travis: We're a very religious group and we like to have a family prayer.
Laura: Speaking of, wait. Where the fuck is Pike?
Sam: Oh shit.
Marisha: She was right behind us!
Matt: You all, you all realize in the chaos and the tension of meeting your father--
Liam: Must've gotten lost!
Travis: No, she's here.
Matt: You catch a sudden flicker of divine energy in the space of the hallway near you. The guards step back, looking a bit freaked out and grabbing their weaponry, and you see a burst of Pike's face coming through, her divine form, and she says, "I'm sorry--" (static) Disappears, comes back. "The walls--can't maintain--" And her form vanishes once again.
Travis: Fucking Verizon. (laughter)
Laura: Great, now we'll never have them as a sponsor. Thank you, Travis.
Liam: Go T-Mobile.
Matt: Go AT-- No.
Marisha: So can we have like a little family pow-wow in maybe one of the rooms before we all tuck in for the night and you put the masking tape over each of our doors so we don't sneak into each other's rooms. High school field trip, yeah?
Sam: I don't know any of those words.
Matt: "Do as you wish, we'll be here if you need us."
Travis: Do you need anything, drinks?
Sam: We need to talk to the little fucker.
Travis: Then-- oh, what? Oh, yeah! Well, let's all head inside for prayer.
Laura: Actually--
Taliesin: We'll need food and drink.
Laura: Guard! One of you, could you go get us some food? We're very hungry.
Marisha: And wine? Maybe some wine?
Laura: As a baroness, I'm very used to getting food when I want it.
Matt: One of the guards steps forward and says, "Let me see that parchment once more, please?"
Travis: That's not it.
Matt: That's a belt buckle. (laughter)
Liam: My belt buckle!
Matt: Rolls it back up, hands it back. "I will retrieve your necessary meal, drink, and other requests you may have."
Liam: Chicken, please.
Laura: Thank you. I want anything but chicken.
Matt: "Noted and noted." And he turns around and leaves the three other guards standing outside of your rooms to do about as you please.
Sam: Right, so we pick the biggest room and we all enter it.
Matt: It's a two-bedroom, opposite sides, and there is a window that has a beautiful view of the central lake that sits at the center of Syngorn, the entire city's built around, before it meets the base of the mountain range that it's buttressed against.
Sam: Titicaca.
Matt: That sounds Elvish, but it's not.
Sam: No, I just like saying that.
Matt: Door closes behind you guys.
Travis: Gormidi?
Matt: There's a little flash, a sparkle of arcane light as the satyr form goes, (breathes heavily) "That was a little harrowing. You didn't tell me you were going to bring me into the belly of the beast so soon, we didn't even talk about-- that was really good tea, by the way; that was quite delicious."
Taliesin: You were drinking our tea?
Matt: "Very quietly."
Marisha: I was wondering where my tea went.
Travis: Now, hold on. Did you steal anything while you were in there?
Matt: "No!"
Marisha: Garmelie...
Matt: "No!"
Sam: Insight-check him.
Travis: Insight-check that bitch!
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: He is about as hard to read as anyone you've come across in the Feywild.
Marisha: Can I try?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: I feel like we don't need an insight check to know he was lying.
Marisha: Oh, I got a 17. I'm way more better than Scanlan. Natural insight. 28.
Matt: 28. Through his teeth.
Marisha: I do a little entangling underneath of him and start checking his pockets, TSA style. Start giving him the frisk.
Matt: These vines wrap up around his legs and he's like, "Oh, I was just!"
Marisha: Into the pockets.
Travis: Just let it happen.
Laura: Where are the pockets?
Matt: In his vest.
Marisha: In his vest pockets.
Taliesin: There better not be an owlbear in there or I'm going to be very upset.
Matt: No, you reach into one pocket, it's empty. You reach into the other, and your arm goes quite far into the pocket, farther than it should--
Marisha: You little devil.
Matt: "What? This is extremely degrading! We had a deal." It's empty.
Marisha: Is this a pocket of holding? I think about the fancy silverware that I might've seen in Syldor's house.
Matt: Nothing. Just an empty space.
Travis: Come on, keep going.
Marisha: I think of fancy teacups, because he mentioned drinking tea.
Matt: (melodically) Nothing!
Marisha: Goddamn it.
Travis: You've never stolen anything, shit!
Laura: Think of gold. Think of gold, Keyleth.
Taliesin: I cast Friends.
Marisha: I think of gold? Oh, I think of gold. Sorry, I'm not materialistic.
Taliesin: We're going to have to have a working relationship.
Laura: Why do you say that like it was a bad thing?
Marisha: I mean, I'm not. I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world. (laughter)
Matt: He smacks the side of your arm and is like, "Get your hand out of my pocket!"
Marisha: Ow!
Liam: Keyleth. Check the fur.
Laura: No, don't check the fur.
Matt: "Excuse me?!"
Taliesin: Let's give him a chance to 'fess up.
Matt: "This is not why we're here to talk. We are here to discuss the elements of our agreement. Two things I require your aid in taking, and then I show you to the outskirts of the Shademirk."
Laura: I feel like now we already know where the outskirts of the Shademirk are.
Matt: "But do you know of the dangers that are on your way?"
Sam: Yeah, you told us about all three dangers that we have to face.
Marisha: That's true. I have them written down. (laughter)
Marisha: The Hut of Wodenna, the Last Camp of Sorudun the Happy, and the theatre.
Matt: "And you think those are all the dangers?! There are so many! It's a dangerous place! Stop touching me!"
Travis: All right, hands off him.
Sam: Just tell us what the two things are we that we need to steal.
Matt: "All right. I require a piece of a threshold crest."
Laura: What the fuck is that?
Marisha: Of a threshold crest?
Liam: Giant stones on the outside of the city.
Matt: "Threshold crest." Which you recall are the blue stones that are in the wall around the city.
Laura: That's the stupidest thing.
Marisha: Oh no!
Matt: "Why is that stupid?"
Laura: Because then they can't go back!
Matt: "You don't have to get it from the wall. I'm sure they build it from something and there might be a reserve somewhere."
Marisha: Right, in the other dimension that they came from. You realize Syngorn didn't originate here in the Feywild, right?
Matt: "I understand, but just..."
Marisha: Oh, lord have-- oh, sweet Sarenrae.
Taliesin: Wait, okay, a threshold-- a piece?
Matt: "A piece of a threshold crest. Just but a sliver."
Liam: The same material?
Matt: "The same material enchanted that is functionally able to be utilized in the same fashion."
Travis: No problem. What else?
Matt: "Great. I also want the High Warden Tyrelda's hat."
Travis: Her hat?
Laura: Do we know what her hat looks like?
Matt: You do, actually.
Laura: What does it look like?
Matt: It's a pointed, small tricorn made of green velvet that she wears when she goes on like excursions outside of the city.
Marisha: Oh my god, she's got a pirate tri-corner hat?
Matt: It's small and very long. Imagine a pirate hat with a little more of an elven sleekness to it.
Laura: Wait, like a Robin Hood hat? Like Peter Pan!
Marisha: Oh my god, like Peter Pan!
Matt: Sure, yeah!
Liam: I wasn't looking forward to this moment, but that actually sounds like fun.
Laura: That's it, that's all you need?
Matt: "That's all! And I will fulfill my side of the deal."
Marisha: I have a vague idea of why you might want a piece of the threshold crest, but why would you want the High Warden's hat?
Matt: "Because I have my reasons."
Taliesin: So. Are you going to give us what you stole now? We have an arrangement.
Matt: "We do have an arrangement."
Taliesin: It's only fair. Come on.
Matt: Reaches into his pocket and pulls out what looks to be a very finely sculpted bronze statue of Syldor that was gifted for essentially his work with Emon and establishing better trade routes between that city and this city. It's basically a good job, salesman of the year award of Syldor's.
Marisha: They stole his Emmy?
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Laura: No, it's like they stole his gold watch.
Liam: I yoink it out of his hand. I'll take that. I got it right here.
Sam: It's a belt buckle.
Liam: Right on my belt.
Travis: So weird, you pickpocketed the thing that wasn't even expensive.
Laura: Why did you take that?
Sam: He can't help it, he's a klepto.
Matt: "No! It was there and nobody was looking."
Marisha: Because it ultimately doesn't matter. You know how awards work. Come on.
Matt: "Regardless, we have business to tend to. Come, we have a hat to catch!"
Liam: Oh, you want to come along?
Marisha: Oh, hang on, before we all leave. Vex and Vax, what did your dad do back in the day? Because he knows Allura and he talked about knowing Thordak.
Laura: He's an ambassador to the city.
Marisha: Does he have any type of fighting capabilities?
Laura: Ugh. If he does, we never saw it.
Liam: Yeah, he'll bore you to death.
Laura: Yeah, he can talk a lot.
Marisha: Because it sounds like he was a part of the mission to lock in Thordak 11 or so years ago.
Laura: What? No way.
Marisha: He mentioned that he's been down this road before.
Laura: He knows Allura because he knew the Council members. He was the one that sent us off to find...
Liam: He's a traveling salesman that sells politics. He's not anything all that fancy.
Marisha: Well, if he sells politics, there could be a lot in selling war against a dragon. I'm not trying to be a dick, but your father was kind of a dick so I'm just questioning it.
Laura: No, he's an asshole. That's totally fine.
Marisha: I'm not trying to talk shit about your family.
Laura: No, feel free.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Y'all should totally fight right now. Just fight in the room while we're all here and take off your clothes.
Marisha: I'm just saying.
Travis: Only way to solve it.
Laura: Totally, totally.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: No, that's a very dark and disturbing thought. I'm very impressed.
Marisha: Thank you! I've been learning from you.
Taliesin: Thank you. Now I feel guilty.
Marisha: I don't mean to question to him, he just said a few things that raised a few hairs on the back of my spine.
Laura: Well, maybe we can ask him about it?
Travis: You have hair on your spine?
Marisha: About this time I use Alter Self to go a little half-Minxie and get those-- like when a dog is pissed off and it puffs up the hair, towards Grog.
Matt: She shows you this emerging patch of fur that is like, shh, pushing out the back of her shoulders.
Laura: That's real sexy.
Travis: Pretty sweet.
Laura: Pretty hot.
Taliesin: It is a very fair point, although I would say I think it would be best to talk to Allura about your father rather than talk to him again, I think he's possibly had enough of us for a while.
Travis: So we have the meeting, we go get the tricorn hat from her, like, boudoir and then we go get the crest on the way out, right?
Sam: Maybe we can even find a clue about where this crest thing is from the meeting.
Matt: "Grand! That's a great idea! That's a great idea."
Laura: Should we sleep before the meeting?
Taliesin: I think the meeting is actually tomorrow.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: It just says we get one meeting, I don't think it's been "sheduled" yet. Should we go "shedule" it?
Laura: Let's "shedule" the meeting.
Travis: Or maybe we could send one of the shitty guards to go "shedule" it for us.
Laura: Is he back from getting us food? Oh no, I hope he's not, because I want to send a second one out there.
Sam: Ooh! Because you're a lady.
Laura: Because I'm a baroness.
Travis: I don't think they're going to leave us all alone.
Taliesin: I have made such a terrible mistake. (laughter)
Matt: You go and check, you check the hallway, and the guard hasn't returned and the three suddenly spin around as the door opens.
Laura: Hello! We require a meeting with the High Warden.
Marisha: I do a little gust cantrip from behind the door to make her hair blow in the wind. (laughter)
Matt: "I need to take this with me. To make the meeting schedulable."
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Laura: "Shedulable."
Matt: "Shedulable."
Travis: Bidet!
Sam: When would we like the meeting? Tonight or tomorrow?
Laura: Tomorrow.
Liam: Tomorrow.
Matt: You guys did wake up about four hours ago?
Liam: Did we?
Sam: Today! Later today.
Taliesin: We'll take the meeting today.
Sam: Right after siesta.
Liam: It's like northern Alaska.
Matt: "Very well. I'll return." He turns around and leaves and the two guards look at each other like, thank god it wasn't us. They both stand at the ready as he goes.
Taliesin: Let that be a lesson to the two of you about making fun of a foreigner's accent. I'm watching you.
Matt: As the door slowly closes.
Taliesin: Schedulable!
Matt: The faun, of which is currently-- Garmelie is up on one of the beds right now, stretched out. "So! What are you waiting for?"
Laura: That's your bed, Keyleth.
Marisha: Aw, man.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Brings up one leg.
Laura: Trinket jumps up on the bed and snuggles in with him.
Matt: "No, don't, ugh!" (bear noises)
Marisha: Aw, they're shedding on it!
Matt: (creak, crash) The bottom cracks and the bed actually falls flat on the ground. The springs destroyed.
Taliesin: It's all right, it's a futon now. It's like college.
Travis: Have we seen any of these threshold crests on our way in?
Liam: Yeah, we walked past some.
Marisha: They're those little blue stones that are keeping the city here.
Travis: Don't say it like it's obvious. I don't pay attention to shit.
Laura: But we just need a sliver of one.
Travis: Right, so like, I could take Vax's head and smash it against one and then pick up the pieces. No, that's a bad thing from your frown.
Marisha: Although Grog doesn't have the worst idea. And I don't mean smashing Vax's head. That's not what I mean. But don't we have some hidden gems, because I'm really terrified if we start hacking away at these stones what might happen.
Laura: They might not be able to return.
Marisha: So maybe we can do something kind of fakey.
Sam: He's in the room. (laughter)
Marisha: Is he asleep? He's asleep, right?
Matt: No, he's currently partially crushed by Trinket on the bed and goes like, "I can hear you!"
Travis: I mean, we have jewels and shit, just stuff hanging around, but what does that do?
Sam: No, how do we know if we can chip a piece off without ruining it?
Laura: I wouldn't risk it.
Liam: I think we should talk to some people and ask a couple of questions around town first.
Laura: Yeah. Maybe somebody, maybe the High Warden knows. Maybe we can sneak it out of there or something.
Liam: Just drop it in passing.
Travis: Ooh! Like a souvenir. "Can we have a piece of your threshold crest?"
Laura: Exactly like that, Grog, exactly like that.
Travis: Shit, I have got all the good ideas today. (laughter)
Travis: I'm the leader. So what do we do until the guard comes back?
Matt: The door opens, the guard comes around with food and hands it out to the rest of--
Laura: Does anybody have money for a tip? Because I think you're supposed to tip them.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "You're not supposed to tip your guards." (boof) Slams the door behind.
Marisha: That's an Emon tradition. We're overseas, remember.
Taliesin: I like it here.
Matt: All right. You finish your meal.
Laura: It's delicious!
Matt: And prepare yourselves for an excursion into the city of Syngorn to seemingly steal a piece of the threshold crest and the High Warden Tyrelda's travel hat.
Marisha: I turn into Minxie and resign to the idea that I'm going to be sleeping with Garmelie and Trinket and just cuddle next to them in Minxie mode.
Laura: Are you coming with us, though, Keyleth?
Marisha: Oh, we're not sleeping?
Sam: No. It's like one in the afternoon, so we'll probably just go.
Liam: But you know, blow a couple more spells.
Matt: So that's one use of your beast form.
Laura: Just come on, then.
Marisha: I'll come on.
Liam: Just save it. You can stay like that, just walk close to me.
Marisha: Am I going to freak people out if I walk around like this?
Taliesin: God, I hope so.
Laura: Fuck them, that's what I say.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way outside into the city streets of Syngorn to hopefully wait for the other guard, who returns about ten minutes later to tell you, "It has been 'sheduled.'"
Travis: Ah, very good.
Matt: "As soon as you wish, attend to the central palace and there you will be greeted."
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: "Are you leaving now?"
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Well, we waste no time.
Matt: Makes a big whistle and the other guards come down, and collectively you now have four guards watching you guys.
Travis: Four?
Laura: Yeah. There were four of them.
Marisha: I drop Minxie form, because that seems very aggressive.
Sam: As we walk I say to Vax  Oi, Vax. What is the reason for this meeting? When we get in there, what do we say to her?
Marisha: Can we have your hat?
Liam: I don't think we should lead with that. Maybe work our way around to it. Well, I would like advice other than this little hairy man for how to get to the bog.
Laura: And also what we might face.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: And how we can fight what we might face.
Marisha: She might know about Fenthras and the bow.
Laura: Yes, exactly.
Travis: Wait, Scanlan, can't you go invisible too? What if you two little buggers just went off and like found it on your own while we were distracting Captain Fancy Hat.
Sam: Find Fenthras on our own, what?
Travis: Yeah, you go invisible along with Fauny Tim over here and you just go find the fucking hat.
Sam: Oh, the hat.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: What if she's wearing the hat? What if the hat is on her head?
Travis: We kill everybody. (laughter)
Taliesin: To be fair, that usually is the plan.
Matt: And thus ended the story of Vox Machina, murdered terribly in the streets of Syngorn by their own people.
Taliesin: Clutching a hat.
Travis: Tarantino film.
Matt: As you guys make your way towards the palace, formulating your plan, we're going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom break here. Guys, about ten, 15 minutes or so, we'll be back here in just a little bit. So use your restrooms, stretch your legs and come back. We'll see you all here in a few minutes. [no audio] (cheering)
Matt: That's a lot of people. Welcome back. First off, I want to say a big thanks to Amanda Mclean for making our awesome graphic for our intermission, thank you Amanda, appreciate that. (cheering)
Matt: We are back. Brought to you by Loot Crate. Let's dive back in, as you guys make your way through the city of Syngorn towards the palace to what would be the northern side of the city. Eventually you come upon the large, slightly swirling stairs that lead to the front of the large brass and ivory surrounded doorway that leads to the interior. You guys have not actually been inside this palace before; you've only seen it from a distance, as your father would not let you in too close to the center of the city. As you make your way up the stairs, you can see guards, the Verdant Guards step out in an aggressive and defensive way, but the guards to your sides immediately put their hands up and signal them to put their arms down and to stand at ease. You guys are brought to the front, the doors open, and a small elderly elvish gentleman comes out, his long white hair almost touching the ground as he shuffles up. He brings a small monocle up to the side of his face. "Yes? Do you have business in the palace?"
Liam: G'day mate.
Marisha: Good day.
Laura: We do. We have a meeting with the High Warden Tyrelda.
Matt: "Let me see your papers. Oh, I see they're right here. Very well. Follow me, please." He turns around and walks his way into the building. You all follow suit and are led through the main entryway to the palace itself. On the inside you can see these giant archways that the pillars that hold them up look like trees that spread to the top like the stone boughs actually hold a canopy made of marble with beautiful portraits and long artistic renditions of the creation of Syngorn, the people, each bloodline that has progressed and taken on the central political structure of the city. As it goes, you can see busts of people who have been of historical importance to Syngorn, and eventually you're brought to the very end of this hallway. Amongst a series of other offshoot hallways and doors, there is the next portion of this journey, this large central chamber. The door is already partially ajar. You are led into what seems to be the equivalent of a throne room, but it appears that there is a half-circle table in the center of the room and a series of chairs that now sit empty across from one side. Your side. The other side of the table, you see sitting quietly and patiently, an older elven woman, you can see the grey in her hair and the crow's-nests at the corner of her eyes, which in elven years means she's quite old, she's probably close to 150 or 200 years old, by your gathering. They can live quite a long time. She would be in the equivalent of her late 50s.
Sam: Not old enough for our party to kill mercilessly.
Matt: No, that's a whole different gauge.
Liam: Throwback Thursday.
Laura: Is she wearing a hat?
Matt: She is not wearing a hat.
Travis: Shit. All right, she lives.
Matt: The guard behind ushers you guys forward toward the chairs. You all get the idea that you should sit.
Sam: We sit.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Are there chairs for all of us?
Matt: There are chairs for all of you but Trinket, who currently, one of the guards is helping to put his hands out in front to keep back, like.
Laura: No.
Liam: That's a good way to lose a finger.
Laura: I wouldn't mess with him if I were you, just to be safe. And I walk up and I give Trinket a kiss on the nose and I put him in his Pokeball.
Matt: The guard leaps back for a second. "That's much easier."
Laura: Just watch closely, buddy.
Matt: You step back, you all find your seats.
Laura: Just talking to my boobs. No big deal.
Liam: Buddy, buddy. (laughter)
Matt: This meeting room pavilion, and as you all have your seat, you see the High Warden waiting there patiently, smile on her face but definitely an expression that shows both intelligence and guard. As you all sit, she looks about the group, asks, "So you've all come and made arrangements to meet with me. You've come quite a ways and with very short notice. I'm curious as to what your reasonings are. Please, state your business."
Liam: You probably recognize the two of us even if you don't know us. We're Syldor's children. This is my sister Vex'ahlia. I'm Vax'ildan.
Matt: "Strange. It has been some time since you've been within the city. Welcome."
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: We're back because we're searching for a certain bow, Fenthras? Said to be within the Murk something?
Liam: Bog of Eternal Stench, I believe.
Marisha: Shadowmurk Bog. That's the one.
Matt: "The Shademirk?"
Marisha: Shademirk. That's it.
Liam: It's not on a lark. We're not a bunch of fly-by-nights. We've already stopped to see Vex's and my father. Over the last several months, we have been dealing, a little more closely than most would want, with the Conclave, these dragons. We know that you are struggling to do the same. We have felled two of them, and I don't say that to brag, just to impress upon you how serious we are. We've come a long way, and we are in need of help. Thank you, darling. I think that the city's intentions are in the best possible place. Brings me a great deal of personal satisfaction, actually. I would like to offer our aid in service of the very same purpose, and that bow, in my sister's hands, will go a long way to felling more of these beasts.
Matt: "Well. You stroll in here with a great deal of arrogance and an air of self-importance. Not in a way that is negative, more in a way that means you aspire, and I hope, not reaching beyond your means. If you have indeed felled these two members of the Conclave as you say, then perhaps this errand to the Shademirk is not as dangerous as one would expect. I would not deny you this, and if you indeed have these capabilities, you should have no issue surviving the Mirk, you and your companions."
Laura: Syldor sent us here because he said you would know what we might face in the Shademirk.
Matt: "Well. The Shademirk, as far as I understand, was once a very beautiful landscape. That once was the fountain heart of the Gilded Run that provided the flowing rivers that spun throughout this entire region. There was an archfey many years before who was turned on by his beloved, who had been growing so spiteful, so full of angst and anger and vengeful thoughts that it turned his heart dark and black and he began to spill into the fen around him. It was there that these lands became the Shademirk. It was there that he became one with the land and corrupted it and turned it. Dryads turned foul and shadowed. Other creatures began to crawl up from the bog itself, and to this day feed off the life of those they can reach. The only thing that holds its spread at bay is the Gilded Run, the rapids. Now, it's found balance, and we watched it spread, as those who've lived here for a long time do. It does not force any sort of immediate threat to any of us, and it serves its own purpose. It has its new-- I shouldn't say new, it's been hundreds of years now-- but its own life, its own biome. And we could not be ones to mess with that, if you will. But it is dangerous, and it is, for those who have scouted far enough to see it, say it is akin to wading through an oil slick. It is to walk into a hungry swamp that never gives up its need to feed."
Laura: Sounds lovely.
Matt: "Yes, quite."
Laura: You say you've lived here. I know the city goes back and forth between the Feywild. Do you travel more freely?
Matt: "I haven't in my older years. When I was younger, perhaps. It is important to maintain an idea of the current state of the Feywild. Every few decades, perhaps every generation, just to be certain when we have to undergo this transition that we don't come into the middle of a war zone in its own right. But I grow tired in my older years, and find myself chained to politics more often than not."
Laura: How did you make that transition so easily? I know that the threshold crests are how the city gets around. (laughter)
Matt: "Well, there are thin areas between the planes, there are doorways, and we have magical means to send small scouting parties between this veil."
Sam: Go on.
Laura: Well, I don't want to be a bother, yes, but. Do they entail any part of those threshold crests? I'm wondering because perhaps we might find ourselves in need of traveling, as well.
Liam: We know we're strangers. But we read much wisdom and experience in your eyes, and it would seem that you have encountered this place yourself, or have experience in the past with those who have, and we're just looking for an edge, really.
Matt: You make a persuasion check.
Laura: Oh, do I want to roll this one or do I want to roll--
Travis: Oh, just pick one.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The ever-plight of Laura Bailey.
Laura: Ooh! That's a good, that's a good, I'm glad I switched!
Travis: There are 300 fucking dice on this table.
Laura: 27.
Liam: Ooh.
Matt: "We have refined the art of creating the threshold crests. We have personalized enchantments that can be utilized for our trained spies, our trained guides, our trained scouts. We keep them under lock and key, but when an endeavor requires the transference between planes, we do on occasion allow these to go into the hands of our greatest guides."
Laura: If a party would be in search of an item that would be of great use to your survival, would that be worthy?
Liam: Listen, we know we're bastards.
Laura: Stop bringing up the bastard part!
Liam: Clearly. Look into my eyes, we share the same goal. Half of my blood is yours. I want to kill the threat to your city and to all cities. I ask with complete humility. I know what I'm asking. Please.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: Which one? Him or me?
Matt: Him.
Laura: Fuck, can I give him advantage, can I help him?
Liam: Using Luck.
Matt: No, he's got Luck. He has his own.
Laura: Come on, you motherfucker.
Liam: Ouch. I rolled the same thing. Low number twice. No, that's a big five.
Laura: Wait, no, everything's ten. I thought everything was a ten!
Liam: No, that's right, you're right. So that is a--
Laura: 12.
Liam: No, 13.
Sam: Oh, that's better.
Matt: It's better.
Laura: Why did you talk? I think she would've listened to me. (laughter)
Matt: "I appreciate your intent, and I understand that our current paths will hopefully align in the near future. However, such artifacts are very important to us and the business within Syngorn, and I mean no offense in saying that you are no longer residents of our city. As such, no, I cannot provide you with these crystals. However, when the time comes, and you retrieve this bow which you say you seek, I hope that we can count each other brethren on the battlefield."
Travis: Can I look around the room? Are there any doors open, ajar, leading into a bedroom with a hat on a rack?
Matt: Make a perception check, Grog.
Sam: Are there any guards in here with us?
Matt: Yeah, the guards have led you in, they're just back by the front door you entered.
Taliesin: There's a hat rack and a Starbucks, that's what's in the room right there. It's a hat rack and a Starbucks.
Travis: 19. Natural.
Liam: I'm rusty on my rules. That should've been a 17.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Liam: I rolled a three, but because of reliable talent, anything lower counts as a ten. Ten plus my persuasion of seven is 17. I'm just rusty.
Matt: I understand. Same answer. (laughter)
Liam: That is racist!
Matt: No, that is a very closely guarded item that would've required a roll of 20 or higher to succeed.
Liam: The whole time I was like, that seems wrong to me; that it's so low.
Matt: Yeah man, reliable talent's good for that reason.
Laura: Why did your luck suck that time?
Matt: It's all right. Grog, glancing about the room, your suddenly strangely keen giant eyes in an elvish realm, you who can read patterns in rock and mountain faces, but when looking at finely crafted marble it's just a big mess. You see at the very back of the chamber what appears to be an imprint into one of the sculptures, one of the almost silver and brass latticework that tends to look like climbing roots and vines across the back of the room. There is a door that is recessed within that, though it's hidden in the sculpture itself. "Now. Unless you have other business?"
Sam: I have a little bit of business.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Good, carry on. Sorry.
Sam: Everyone who meets me knows I am a collector of hats. (laughter)
Sam: I take out my beret and I put it on and I say, why, this one was a very special beret I got by defending Whitestone against an invasion of vampires, singlehandedly freeing the city from the scourge.
Matt: "That sounds entirely believable."
Sam: Yes. It's a fine garment woven by a master craftsman. I hear you have a fine hat, as well, that you've been seen wearing about town. Is that true?
Taliesin: I wish I could say this isn't true, but it's actually true. He is genuine.
Matt: "I have been known to have a few garments based on where I'm going, yes."
Sam: As a fine appreciator of the haberdasher arts-- (laughter)
Sam: A connoisseur, really. Could you humor an old gnome like me and show me... I hear tell of a green hat. A tri-tip hat, right?
Marisha: I thought it was blue.
Sam: Blue hat?
Marisha: Might be green.
Taliesin: He's also colorblind, I should mention.
Sam: Tri-tip, triangular-- I just hear it's fantastic, I've never seen one quite like it up close. I was wondering if I could take a look-see.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: With disadvantage.
Matt: Yeah, because you didn't sleep.
Marisha: Yeah, you didn't sleep, Scanlan!
Sam: Well, that was a natural 20. But the first one was a six. Luckily, it's plus 14, so 20. (laughing and cheering) [no audio]
Matt: Bards! "From political requests to a hat collector, this is indeed a very strange afternoon in the palace. Yes, I can have one of my servants show you."
Sam: Thank you so much, it would mean so much to me. I've never met a hat I didn't like.
Matt: "Then I am certain you will be fulfilled."
Sam: Should we just wait here, or is it going to be a while?
Matt: "No, I'll have a servant bring you up." And she puts her hand up and the guards open the door and you see a servant walk out who looks to be a younger elven man. Actually probably about the age of Vax there. Short tattered hair comes across in front of his eyes. He enters. "Yes, mother?" "Could you please show this strange little gnome man to the hat room?" "Yes, of course. Yes. Follow me."
Sam: There's a hat room? I have a hat room in my place, too!
Matt: "That's splendid. Now, is there any other business?"
Taliesin: Just to be clear, you would say that the river is probably our safest mode of entry into the bog?
Matt: "It surrounds the bog and runs past the southern portion of it, so you'll most likely come upon the river one way or another. Lest you wish to traverse the Green Sea, but that I would not recommend, either."
Marisha: So there's no real easy way into the bog, is what you're saying?
Matt: "There's no easy way to anything in the Feywild, my child."
Marisha: Got it.
Laura: Have you seen the tree yourself?
Matt: "I have not."
Taliesin: Are there river men who run boats on the river?
Matt: "No, the river tends to run itself." (laughter)
Taliesin: I had that coming. That's fair.
Travis: That's good.
Matt: "Do you wish to inquire about my shoes? My coat perhaps..."
Marisha: Oh my god, they're so cute, though. They're amazing shoes. I didn't notice them until you pointed them out, sorry. No, continue on.
Matt: "Is that all?"
Taliesin: I think that's all, yes.
Matt: "All right. Good luck. I wish you safe--"
Marisha: Oh, wait, wait, lady!
Sam: High Warden, High Warden.
Marisha: High Warden. I'm sorry. I was just curious. It's my first time to Syngorn, and it's in the Feywild. It's special, right? Is there a gift shop? A visiting the temple and sights of Syngorn type of shop?
Sam: I went to Syngorn and all I got was this lousy shirt?
Marisha: Right!
Laura: We have to make that shirt!
Liam: Shirt after this one.
Matt: "I'll see what Braum can do. Braum, please escort them to some semblance of a gift shop."
Marisha: Oh, thank you!
Taliesin: Good luck.
Matt: "Now, I have important business to tend to. Good luck. Safe travels. Don't die. Let us see each other on the battlefield soon to slay a dragon. Now, please, be on your way."
Laura: We appreciate your time.
Matt: You guys get up and leave, Trinket goes--
Laura: Trinket's in my necklace.
Matt: That's right, Trinket is in your necklace, so Trinket does nothing.
Laura: Trinket does nothing but stare outside of the necklace.
Matt: You make your way out of the room, the guards following suit. You can see the lightish brownish reddish tousled hair of the elven boy who's waiting, he's wearing very fine clothing, though very baggy on his scrawny frame. As you all step out, he says, "All right, so, I'm to take you to the hat room, I believe. Oh, you're going to be very happy. It's quite the room."
Sam: The room I could care less about, it's those hats!
Matt: "Well, I think you'll still be pleased. Are you all coming?" (noises of agreement)
Liam: Traveling with Scanlan, we've all become amateur hat enthusiasts.
Laura: I pull out my hat and I put it on.
Travis: Yep, I pull out the rhinoceros horn.
Liam: (gong) (laughter)
Matt: And he pulls out a little masquerade mask and goes like, "Oh my goodness!"
Sam: You're a hatter, too!
Marisha: Do you get the monthly newsletter?
Matt: "Well, I used to, until we came to the Feywild. It's very boring these days. Well, come, please!" And he darts off excitedly down the hallway. The guards groan loudly behind you. You make your way through the second hallway on the left of the palace, down a flight of stairs into a storage room. To the left you can see what looks to be the entrance to some sort of a heavily barred metallic doorway, about ten feet wide, about 12 feet tall. Further down you come to two doorways. He pulls out a keyring, goes, "No, not that one. Ah, here we are." It opens up into a small room, you can see in here, it's a display room. In here you can see ornamental armor and helmets and all sorts of classic Syngorean designs, which change often because, well, elves when they don't have a lot of things to fill their time with, it's all about designing new outfits and new armor. There's a whole display of very classic designs for the guards, for the watchers, for the people who first founded Syngorn. It's like a history walk through. But there is a section that is primarily helmet designs for different stations and, "This is as close to a hat room as we have. This here is part of the original Temple of Ioun design. It is a delightful piece." He keeps going on and on.
Laura: Do we see the hat that we're looking for in here?
Matt: You do see there is a small rack to the side which is for more just things that are used and you can see there are like wide-brim, rainy-day, carriage-driving hats, you can see there are far-brimmed cloak hoods that are used for horse-riding beneath the rain, you can see there are a few more curved up to one side archer-based hats, and you can see there a nice green velvet hat that is resting across.
Liam: Is that the one area with hats?
Laura: Are they all just jumbled in together?
Matt: They're all jumbled in together in that corner and then the actual helmets are against the wall in different setups.
Liam: Go ahead.
Laura: I nudge Vax and I point it out.
Liam: Scanlan, look at all those codpieces across the room!
Laura: Are the guards in here with us?
Matt: They are, yes.
Laura: I prat-fucking-fall. I pratfall right in front of the guards, on the opposite side of the room.
Matt: Which one?
Laura: I walk to the other side of the room and I just fall over.
Liam: Eat shit, knock shit over.
Matt: Make a perform check.
Laura: Oh, shit. Can it be acrobatics, though?
Matt: No, acrobatics is avoiding the fall.
Laura: Shit. Okay. 19?
Matt: 19!
Laura: I want to take some shit down with me.
Matt: And you do, delightfully so. You fall over, trip, go into a tumble, grab arm over pieces of metallic armor, (crashing sound).
Laura: Ah, oh god, did you see that--
Marisha: Oh my god, Vex, are you okay?
Laura: I think there was a marble on the ground.
Marisha: Oh no, what? Keyleth turns to the guard. (laughter)
Marisha: That was Lady Vex'ahlia, the Baroness of Whitestone. I could sue you! I could sue you for negligence.
Matt: Make a sleight-of-hand check.
Sam: Hold on, he's making a check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: All right. You take the hat. You place it away. Everyone seems to be focused on the currently yelling Vex'ahlia--
Laura: Ow, I think I hurt my wrist!
Marisha: You will get a letter from me, good sir. You will get a letter, okay?
Matt: "This was, look, I apologize if your friend is clumsy, but this wasn't part of our job description, okay, it's been a very--"
Marisha: Your five-star review just went to a four, okay? I just want to say.
Matt: Braum pushes his way in and goes like, "I am so terribly sorry. I didn't mean-- I hope this hasn't ruined your opinion of the hat room."
Laura: If we could just see a gift shop, I would be thrilled.
Travis: And I say to the side, I go, (coughs) pinch my knee, is that the one?
Marisha: What?
Matt: "Are you feeling all right, sir?"
Travis: Yeah, no, (coughs) pinch my knee if that's the one. No, to the little, to the little satyr.
Taliesin: Let's just find a gift shop, Lady Tyrell doesn't need to hear anything about this. Let's just move on.
Matt: "Lady who?"
Marisha: High Warden Tyrelda.
Sam: High Warden Tyrelda.
Taliesin: Tyrelda.
Sam: Yes, well, there's another lady named Lady Tyrell, who's...
Taliesin: No, this is amazing what my handwriting does.
Liam: What did you put in that tea, Percival?
Matt: "Well, I'm glad to see this hasn't ruined your opinion of the collections here."
Liam: Just the safety codes, really.
Marisha: If you took us to the gift shop, it might fix things. Okay?
Matt: "Then come, come! You two clean this up!" And the two guards go, "What?" "Yes, my lord." And the two guards eye you very intensely as they walk over and start picking up all the pieces of armor--
Laura: Ow!
Marisha: I start pretending like I'm doing a Cure Wounds spell to her wrist, you know?
Matt: All right. As you guys make your way out, with two of the guards now; two of them are now left behind.
Taliesin: As we walk out, I just make sure the two guards are, I hope this didn't interrupt your schedules for today.
Sam: "Shedule."
Taliesin: Yes, schedule.
Matt: Somehow their chin goes higher. It's impressive, really. You make your way through, down another set of hallways, back towards the beginning of the palace, he goes, "It's not really a gift shop, the closest thing that we could ascertain based on your request is, we do have a small collection of gifts and knick-knacks we've received from allies over time that really aren't much use to us."
Marisha: Wait, you're taking us to the lost and found? Please! This is the high baroness Lady Vex'ahlia!
Matt: "Perhaps you'll find something you like."
Laura: No, lost and found is a wonderful place to go.
Matt: "It's a combination lost and found and just... gifts from political allies that didn't understand the High Warden's aesthetic. Yes, no, please, this way please." And he leads you back to the main hallway you guys walked through, a little ways towards the entrance, and then another hallway to the left, he unlocks and this is straight-up like a dark storage room, it is just boxes and boxes that are sealed and he lights a small lantern on the side. It flickers to life, and the flame itself, as opposed to a low oil lantern flicker is like a bright glowing light, you can see this is a magically set lantern, as most of the lights in the city are just everlit torches or things that flicker on and off as a light spell. It illuminates the room around you and you can see no one's walked in here in a while.
Liam: These are for sale?
Matt: "No, these are for the taking should you wish."
Laura: Awesome.
Sam: Well, what do we see?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Marisha: Can I ask a logistical question?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: Is Garmelie with us or did we leave him behind?
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: You don't know.
Sam: Grog might know.
Liam: 18.
Marisha: Grog.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 18, 19, are you searching, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: What'd you get?
Travis: Nine. (laughter)
Marisha: Wait, is this an investigation?
Laura: Come on, natural 20!
Marisha: Natural one.
Liam: Oh, propeller beanie!
Matt: Keyleth is distracted by the pretty light in the fixture.
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: Scanlan comes up next to her and is equally distracted by this wonderful magical light. Like two moths to a flame. Percival?
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: Nine. All right. The two twins, you guys spend some time looking through the nearby riffraff and Braum is in the back, hoping you find something to satiate your need for gifts. The twins find their way through a few boxes, and you open up and there's small porcelain dolls, dressed up in ancient Emon's outfits and designs. You can see what looks to be very dusty Kraghammer designed weaponry, you can see what looks to be a bunch of small game pieces that half of them have been lost, like a chessboard of some kind, but only part of it's there. This is really the junk room. This is where all the really bad Christmas presents get put every year. "No, thanks, it's great!"
Sam: Is it like Storage Wars, where there might be something?
Matt: It could, it could be depending on how well you search.
Sam: Well, I searched terribly.
Matt: You did.
Marisha: Keyleth starts talking up Braum. Braum?
Matt: Okay. Braum.
Marisha: Braum. So, Braum. Where're you from?
Matt: "Syngorn?" (laughter)
Travis: Good start.
Sam: We don't have to distract him, he said it's all for the taking.
Marisha: Oh, it's all for-- really, oh.
Sam: No, that's fine, we don't have to.
Marisha: You didn't see any distraction. You didn't see anything.
Matt: "I am so confused by all of you."
Laura: Can I try to do an arcana check to see if there's anything magic in the room?
Matt: Sure. Make an arcana check.
Travis: I'll join you. Two.
Laura: Oh shit, I just rolled off the table. How did I do that? 16.
Matt: Your untrained, though natural arcane instincts reveal to you that--
Laura: I can speak with animals.
Matt: Yes, you can. And there are no animals here. Nothing even remotely magical seems to cross your attention span, unfortunately, and you guys spend a good hour in here sifting through--
Liam: As, as we're digging in the corner, I say, I thought maybe coming back here I might like this city a little bit better, and I was fucking wrong.
Laura: This place fucking sucks.
Sam: Let's get out of here.
Travis: Yeah, there's nothing in here.
Sam: No, let's leave.
Marisha: Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.
Travis: Let's go.
Taliesin: Pick something pretty.
Marisha: Your four-star rating just went down to a three.
Taliesin: I am picking something random from the room.
Marisha: And I'll also pick something random out of spite. I'll take this.
Matt: You have a fine tobacco box at your disposal now, Keyleth. You can write that down.
Marisha: I like it. I chose it on purpose.
Matt: Percy, you find half of a jeweler's kit.
Taliesin: That's perfect.
Marisha: That's awesome.
Taliesin: I am excited. Was it literally cut in half, like literally?
Matt: Half the supplies are there.
Marisha: And did you say I had a half a tobacco box? Or no, just a tobacco box?
Matt: You had an older tobacco box.
Marisha: An old tobacco box. All right. Yeah, sure.
Matt: Braum at this point goes, "I hope you've all found something you liked."
Laura: All right, I grab something random, too. I mean, if we're all doing it.
Matt: All right. You reach into the Syngorean Wal-mart gift bag on the way out.
Liam: Come on, secret Santa.
Laura: Come on. Roll for value.
Matt: No. I'll do that.
Laura: No whammies.
Matt: You bring out what looks to be a really intricately carved music box made of dark wood.
Laura: Ooh, that's neat.
Matt: As you shake it, you hear (ting-ting) little remnants of the last winding come through, and it seems to still play.
Laura: Mine. I'm writing it down.
Travis: All right, I want to reach in and grab something out of there too. All right, fine!
Matt: You reach in and you pull out a potato. (laughter)
Matt: But it's been there for a while, so like the roots are growing out and everything.
Liam: Oh, with leaves coming out of it.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I take a bite out of it.
Matt: That is a stale potato.
Liam: Make a constitution check.
Marisha: Keyleth takes the potato. Okay, give it to me, give it to me.
Travis: Oh here you go. And I squash it in my hand.
Matt: (squelch) up the sides of it. Braum goes, "If you could clean that up?" And the guard goes aww and starts picking up the potato chunks off the ground.
Laura: We're down to one!
Liam: Hey gang, I feel like we've lost focus here. (laughter)
Liam: Maybe we should--
Sam: --get out of here.
Laura: Oh, do we find any broken threshold crests?
Matt: You do not.
Laura: Damn it.
Marisha: Okay, wait, do we find any pictures of threshold crests? Or a postcard?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: We're fine.
Laura: All right.
Travis: We leave.
Marisha: We'll just go.
Sam: We got the hat.
Taliesin: We have a plan.
Matt: Braum leads you out of the room, closes and locks it behind, you guys walk back to the hallway that split off, you go past the large metal door again, find your way up into the foyer area at the front of the palace, he goes, "Well, I hope I've been of help to you. I hope I've delivered your interest in seeing our fine selection of helmets and hats here in Syngorn?"
Sam: I am more than satisfied. I will write a five-star review.
Matt: "I don't know what any of that means, but I assume that's good, and I thank you for that. Goodbye."
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: Charming.
Marisha: Good day.
Laura: Good day.
Matt: The guard that was cleaning the potato follows suit, you guys now have two guards, the other two have not returned. So you have two guards following you.
Travis: I don't know if you guys noticed, but there was this recessed door up in the queenie's room, but I don't know if maybe she would have some fancy stuff back there. Can't shake these guards.
Sam: Well, some of us could slip in anyway, but what do you think we will find there?
Travis: Well, I don't know. I just noticed, because I wasn't paying attention to all the talking.
Marisha: I think Percy and I can fake them out.
Sam: Fake them out? What do you mean, fake them out?
Marisha: Wait, is he around? Don't say it out loud.
Taliesin: There's no fake. It's not faking. I've got a plan. It's not fake, I've got a plan. It's a good plan. But we should sit, recuperate, go somewhere quiet and figure out how we're getting to the bog.
Marisha: How long have we been awake at this point?
Matt: You mean since you guys woke up this morning, I'd say six hours?
Laura: That's it?
Travis: We don't want to go try and bust one of the crests we already saw?
Laura: We could seriously like fuck it up, what if they can't get back?
Travis: Who gives a fuck?
Laura: They have an entire army to help fight Thordak.
Travis: I didn't think that far ahead, I'm sorry.
Sam: Well, Vex, they could repair it; they have magicians here and stuff.
Travis: Thank you, Scanlan.
Taliesin: How do you repair a--
Sam: With arcane juju.
Laura: You make a very good point. A very good point.
Marisha: But they said they got these stones from the other side, from our realm.
Laura: Maybe we should just go fucking check them out.
Liam: The two guards are here to whole time, right?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Yeah. We should really go take a nap, I think we should go take a nap.
Laura: This dusk is really making me--
Matt: Vex. You hear muttered under the breath of one of the guards, "Thank god." (laughter)
Matt: Very low; nobody else hears it.
Marisha: I've got plenty of energy.
Laura: I mean, is, is anyone else super duper tired? Are you guys tired?
Marisha: I'm--
Marisha: Tired.
Taliesin: Tired.
Marisha: So tired.
Laura: I look at the guards. I mean, are you guys tired? I mean, how do you even know what fucking time it is, right?
Marisha: Right?
Matt: "Do you wish to be escorted to your quarters, then?"
Laura: I would love to get some sleep.
Matt: "Please follow us." And they both lead on, leading you back to the rooms you guys had set for the evening's rest. Eventually you get to your rooms, the guards stay stationed outside, and you are led into your individual spaces.
Laura: There's windows though, yeah?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And the guards leave us in our rooms, obviously.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: So wait, are we all in our own individual rooms?
Taliesin: We have earrings, we could just talk on the earrings.
Matt: You all go into a room together, then.
Laura: Super duper happy, all together.
Matt: You have four rooms at your disposal and you all say, we're going to go sleep, and all go into one room with a broken bed.
Sam: We're a close-knit family.
Liam: You can make your own assumptions.
Marisha: We can go into our own rooms and I can fix it if we don't want to tip people off.
Sam: No, we do what we want.
Travis: Yeah, we're fucking close, man.
Matt: All right, you guys all enter the largest room where you met before, and as you all find your way in there, one of the guards goes, "You're going to sleep--"
Marisha: It's for prayer. We have to pray. Remember, right, Grog?
Travis: Oh yes, we're very holy.
Laura: Yes, it's been quite a while. I'm rather hungry.
Sam: We all sleep together; it's a polyamorous thing. (laughter)
Travis: I told you we were holy.
Matt: Scanlan and Vex, make deception checks, please.
Laura: Perception?
Matt: Deception.
Liam: Deception.
Laura: Deception. Oh. Ten?
Sam: 21.
Liam: (cackles) That's the lie that goes through.
Matt: When you say you're tired and ready to rest, the guard goes, "Mm-hm." And then when you say polyamorous, the guard goes, "Oh." (laughter)
Sam: Yeah, man. We are freak-ay.
Liam: I grab Grog by the circlet thing and say, come on, I'm tense. Let's go. (laughter)
Matt: The two guards, the two guards look at each other and take two steps away from the room. "We'll keep a close watch."
Marisha: Keyleth says, we're totally polyamorous--
Taliesin: You! No!
Marisha: And I turn Percy and Vax into squirrels with Polymorph. See? Polyamorous.
Matt: The two guards look at each other, very disturbed and say, "You've already shared too much, we don't judge, just please go 'sleep'." They both hold their blades at the ready, both just like, "What is my life right now?" All right.
Sam: We may need you to clean up for us later.
Matt: "Please! Go! Sleep!" You guys are now closed off inside your room.
Laura: And the squirrels.
Matt: As squirrels. What are you going to do?
Marisha: Okay, I drop Polymorph. That's what polyamorous means, right, guys?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Garmelie, show thyself.
Matt: He appears and goes like, "Was that true?" (laughter)
Matt: He has his sketchbook at the ready and is like, "Because I mean..."
Taliesin: No. No.
Sam: You don't know.
Matt: "Well." He closes the book. "So. I believe someone here took a hat?"
Liam: I might have a hat for you. The other adventure didn't turn out so well, and I really want to give you this hat. I'm wondering-- fuck it, I don't have anything to say, take the fucking hat.
Matt: And he puts it on. It's a little small. But he goes, "Ah, it's fine." Smiles back.
Liam: So worth it.
Laura: Yeah. That was definitely worth it.
Matt: He seems extremely proud and happy that this hat is now in his possession. "One of two. Now, the second part."
Sam: Any ideas there, Garmelie?
Matt: "No."
Laura: You passed by those threshold crests several times, I'm assuming.
Taliesin: Let me get this straight, Garmelie. You require of us a piece of a threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Any threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes!"
Taliesin: Just as long as it's a threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes!"
Marisha: And looks like a crest.
Taliesin: It's a threshold crest.
Matt: "A threshold crest."
Taliesin: Okay, Keyleth. The thing we talked about.
Marisha: And I start casting Stone Shape right under the threshold of the door to the room that we're in, and I cut out a crest from the threshold.
Matt: What crest do you create? What does it look like?
Marisha: A Whitestone crest. From the threshold of the door.
Taliesin: We break it.
Marisha: There's a piece of your threshold crest. (laughing and cheering)
Taliesin: Don't cast Friends on people. It's not nice.
Matt: You watch as his ears, his pointed ears slowly slink back and his hair stands up all across the back of his head, his beard almost bristles out into spines as the hat goes (poink) and pops off and hits the ground. He snatches it up. Grabs the piece.
Taliesin: That's your threshold crest. Piece of a threshold crest.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: Yay!
Matt: "Well, it appears that our deal has been kept." (laughing and cheering)
Matt: He snaps his fingers and you feel like this sudden, this almost unnoticeable pressure at the base of your neck that you had felt since you made the deal release and absolve, on both of you. "All right, so. Well, at least I got the hat out of it. So. The Shademirk, then? Come, follow me, grab your things." (laughs)
Marisha: Let's go.
Taliesin: I cannot wait.
Matt: "Now." He vanishes. And Grog, you feel a little tug on your finger to pull you forward.
Travis: I fart. (laughter)
Matt: "I had that coming. We now have even more of a reason to make haste. This is a very small room, and I've been following behind him for quite some time. Let's go. Now, quickly." And you see Grog being pulled forward by the finger, and you guys get the feeling that he's leading you out of the city, invisible, by Grog's finger.
Travis: We're going this way. Follow me, chaps!
Marisha: Follow the finger.
Sam: Are the guards following?
Matt: The two guards are following, yes.
Laura: Woo, that was really fun.
Marisha: My hair is messed up.
Sam: Good sesh.
Laura: Good. That was really...
Liam: Thanks, Grog. (laughter)
Liam: I feel loose as a goose. Let's go see this bog.
Marisha: And I transform into a goose and come out as a goose.
Matt: "You-- (frustrated noise) Never mind." The guards follow at a very healthy distance now, both whispering to each other as they watch you walk.
Laura: I think we made a really good impression on this city coming back.
Travis: I'm going to kill you later.
Matt: You guys are led back through the main portion of Syngorn, towards the front gates where the watchers reside. The doors are opened for you, and you are escorted out the front gate, where the guards very happily leave you to be. And both turn around at each other and go, (heavy sigh) and they walk back inside the confines of the outer Syngorean wall. You guys are now back out in the wilds of Syngorn, the finger tugs lead you out past the front of the city, through the marshlike mandrake fields that you initially traversed when you made your way to Syngorn, and then find your way back into the Ever-Shifting Grasses, heading duskward, towards where it seems the dusk sun will set.
Laura: Duskward.
Taliesin: Duskward.
Marisha: Always duskward.
Sam: I hate that direction.
Matt: There's also nightward, seaward, or tangleward. Which would you prefer?
Sam: Are those different directions?
Matt: Yes, those are different directions.
Laura: Tangleward? Did you say tangleward?
Matt: Tangleward. It was mentioned before, yeah.
Laura: Oh. I just thought of the Disney movie and I think I spaced out there.
Matt: I'm pretty sure that the people in the Feywild haven't seen that. Not yet. They're waiting for it to come out on Blu-Ray. All right. So you make your way towards where the grasses get heavy again, and you see Garmelie (foosh) once again take visible form again and be like, "Ah, sorry, that concentration for a while really gets to you, I'm so glad to be out of that stuffy place. So! Shall we?" Rights his hat. And even in righting it, it's a little crooked to one side and he begins marching duskward.
Laura: Onward to the theater!
Matt: "No! No theater! We are avoiding the theater! No."
Travis: Garmelie, how far of a journey is it to this bog?
Matt: "Say about four times since we met?"
Laura: Okay.
Travis: That doesn't mean anything to me.
Laura: Four times since we met.
Liam: I'm just curious, why are you so worried about the theater? I love the theater.
Matt: "I have my reasons." And he continues walking forward.
Liam: Thanks, great. Good talk.
Laura: It's been 14 hours since we've met.
Sam: Can we travel any faster than that? Can we mist, can we tree, can we...?
Laura: Wait a minute, you could-- if you know a tree is-- that would be pretty stupid, to just pop out of the cancerous tree, but if we know a tree is there, couldn't you potentially just fucking do it?
Liam: You've had a lot of good ideas. That's not one of them. That's a bad idea.
Marisha: She's not wrong.
Laura: Wait! Keyleth, what if you just open up the cancerous tree, we reach through, we grab the fucking bow, and then we're out.
Marisha: Well, you're not entirely wrong, I don't know if I can Teleport via Plants because generally that takes knowing the plant. However, I do have Tree Stride, which means we can-- nope, never mind, I can only do that on myself.
Matt: Wah-wah.
Taliesin: We are not sending Keyleth the goose into a bog to retrieve a bow from an angry cancerous tree.
Marisha: But I'm loosey! I'm a loosey goose.
Matt: That would look amazing on an epitaph, I'm just saying.
Marisha: We can mist there.
Sam: Would that save time, I don't remember how fast we go.
Marisha: I might have to take a hot nap.
Travis: A hot nap?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Didn't you guys just take a hot nap? (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah. The answer is yes. I can do all those things.
Taliesin: Well, let's travel for a bit and then we'll take a proper break.
Marisha: If we can get to the edge of the bog, then we'll take a sleep.
Laura: Wait, I think the edge of the bog is kind of far, though.
Taliesin: We'll start our journey, and the next leg of our journey.
Travis: Yeah, let's get going.
Marisha: We'll go until we're tired.
Matt: "I like the sound of that."
Laura: Oh. (belches) (laughing and cheering)
Matt: "Most impressive for a lady."
Laura: Thank you. That's a baroness burp.
Marisha: Robert Durst shit.
Matt: As you guys push on further northward at the behest of Garmelie, you push for another two hours or so through the Ever-Shifting Grasses, and as you get further and further north, the color of the grass seems to go from that deep verdant green to almost a maroon purplish color.
Laura: I pop Trinket out of the necklace.
Matt: He attacks some of the grass and chews it up.
Laura: Yeah, get it!
Marisha: Don't touch the grass, it'll get angry at you! It'll yell at you for a week!
Travis: I don't think that applies here.
Laura: It's okay, darling. It's okay. Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Laura: Do not yell at my bear.
Marisha: I was just trying to protect him.
Liam: I give him some grass.
Marisha: Don't!
Sam: It's fine.
Taliesin: It's fine.
Matt: And just keeps going forward through the grass fields.
Marisha: Does the grass seem angry?
Matt: No, it just seems to be changing color.
Marisha: Suck it, grass!
Matt: As you say that, the grass goes from a purplish color to a deep, deep red around you.
Sam: Oh god.
Marisha: Because you... suck out the joy of all of us living around you, and you're so amazing.
Travis: That makes it even worse.
Sam: Not a compliment.
Travis: You're still going in the same direction.
Marisha: I mean, you suck out bad--
Liam: I grab Keyleth's hand. Let's take a walk.
Matt: All of you, as you're walking, the actual grasses around you are getting more and more dense and are catching on your feet and you're finding that your progression is getting slower and slower.
Laura: Wait, no. I have Landstride, which means I don't slow against any land.
Matt: Yeah, so you're fine, you just coast ahead. The rest of the party, it's like they're going through waist-high thickets. The grass looks gentle, but as soon as it hits your body, it rakes across it almost like very fine serrated plants, and it's catching on your clothing and pulling you back. It's almost like since those statements were made... (laughter)
Travis: I have a hooded lantern. I could set this whole fucking thing ablaze.
All: No!
Matt: The red goes to a deep cinder-like red.
Sam: Are we going to have roll initiative on grass?
Laura: No, wait.
Taliesin: Does no one-- I'm going to take a moment.
Marisha: I feel like the grass feels our emotions.
Sam: Your emotions. Because you yelled at it.
Taliesin: Lovely field, I apologize for the rudeness of my compatriots. We will be gentle trouncing through you. We will make as little mark as we can and enjoy the splendor of your ever-changing colors. You are majestic, you are windswept-- I'm flirting with grass-- you are everything I could hope for in a beautiful view.
Sam: I sing a song.
Matt: What do you sing? (cheering)
Sam: (singing) Keep growing. Keep flowing, knowing you can always count on me.
Travis: (singing) For sure.
Laura: (singing) For sure.
Sam: (singing) For sure.
Sam: (singing) That's what Scanlan's for. (cheering)
Matt: Percy, I want you to make a persuasion check against the grass? Adding the d10 inspiration die.
Taliesin: Oh, d10 inspiration. Come on.
Marisha: I do an interpretive dance.
Sam: Come on, persuade that plant.
Taliesin: That was leaning.
Sam: That was a leaner.
Taliesin: That jumped, but that's still fine, okay, it's. Persuasion check? Oh yeah, that's not bad. 24.
Matt: What was it?
Taliesin: Eight plus six plus seven. (counting) 21.
Sam: It's more than that.
Matt: Between the interpretive dance of Keyleth amongst the tattered angry grasses, the beautiful vocal stylings of Scanlan Shorthalt, and Percy speaking out a wondrous poem towards the Ever-Shifting Grasses, you watch as the deep bright red subsides into the relaxed purple, and eventually goes back to a dull green, and you find your traveling no longer impeded as it once was.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Good job!
Laura: Good job!
Matt: You successfully parlayed with a field.
Travis: First doors, then grass.
Liam: Don't talk shit to grass!
Sam: How do you want to mow this? (laughter)
Matt: So. About another half an hour of travel before in the distance ahead of you can see the dark edge of what looks to be another forest ahead of you, wide and almost end-to-end, you see it. A lot of these wooded areas almost meet the horizon, it's like you're stepping into just an endless wall of trees. As you begin to approach closer to the edge, Garmelie looks up and says, "All right. So we have choices now. We have the Moonbrush before us, or we have the Green Sea, which is far seaward of here. I would recommend the Moonbrush."
Sam: Then we should go the other way. Because we don't trust a fucking thing you say.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: Wait.
Taliesin: No, the High Warden did say--
Marisha: -- to avoid the Green Sea.
Laura: Why do you recommend the Moonbrush?
Matt: "Because it's the only real route to get to the Gilded Run."
Laura: What is the Gilded Run?
Matt: "The Gilded Run are the rivers that surround it."
Laura: Right, those.
Matt: "Yes. You're looking for the Shademirk. You have to get through the Gilded Run to get the Shademirk. You have to go through the Moonbrush to get to the Gilded Run."
Liam: Where's the theater?
Matt: "No theater!"
Travis: Right, so we're going through the brushy moon?
Matt: "Yes! Come, come."
Laura: Yeah? Are you okay with that, Scanlan?
Sam: I'll allow it.
Marisha: How long have we been awake?
Matt: You are... you've been awake for about 12 hours now, I'd say.
Marisha: If we want to mist there, then we have to sleep. But we'll press on for a few more hours.
Matt: Certainly. About another 40 minutes of foot travel before you begin to hit the edge of the Moonbrush Forest. As you approach, Garmelie says, "All right, so things you should know about the Moonbrush. One: it is home to a number of denizens." And as you look overhead, you can see it's a thick fog that permeates the entirety of this forest. You can see the outline of every tree trunk towards the outer rim of this entire brush. The canopy of the trees themselves are like long weeping willows that sag and give this very ominous feeling to the entire forest. You can see small mountain spires breaking through portions of the tree line in the distance occasionally, miles between each other, sometimes a cluster far closer together. He says, "There is a clan of sorts that lives amongst the forest, we'll try our best to avoid. They are natural hunters and they are of the lycan persuasion."
Sam: Oh.
Taliesin: Oh.
Matt: "So, best that we avoid interaction. They are well-read, they have a society; we should touch none of it."
Marisha: Question. You mentioned we are going into the Moonbrush with lycan hunters?
Matt: "Yes. It's a necessity."
Marisha: Yeah, no, it sounds like it. Yeah.
Matt: "Yes. But they do have natural enemies. There is a faction of pixies that live within, known as the Wishers, and they are forever locked in a struggle. So avoid both, do not get involved at all, and we'll be fine."
Laura: Do the lycan tend to populate trees, or if we stay up high can we maybe avoid them?
Matt: "Actually, they travel mostly in the trees. That's the easiest way for them to hunt, is unseen."
Laura: Well, there you go.
Matt: "They are ruled by a singular lycan lord, who goes by the name of Ukurat."
Marisha: What?
Sam: Ulurat?
Matt: "Ukurat."
Marisha: Ukurat.
Laura: Ukurat or Udurat?
Matt: "Ukurat."
Laura: Ukurat.
Liam: Ukurat.
Matt: "U-K-U-R-A-T."
Travis: Bob.
Matt: "He is to also be avoided."
Taliesin: Is that an elven name? Is that an elven word?
Matt: "It was, once."
Laura: Wait, he used to be elven? He used to be elven.
Matt: "They all used to be many things. He happened to be elven at one time, yes? So. Anyway. We'll avoid them, and avoid the Wishers, and also those things, the little plants that you saw before?"
Laura: Mandrakes?
Matt: "Mandrakes? Also everywhere. Avoid them."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "And we'll just avoid the other things I mentioned, so. Shall we?" And he begins to step and march up to the edge of the Moonbrush.
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: It's fine. We've killed dragons, we'll be fine.
Travis: I'm so stoked right now.
Marisha: Did we-- okay, yeah. Sure. Yeah.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way into the dark Moonbrush itself and as you walk into the forest, immediately you can hear the swell of distant crickets, thousands upon thousands, sourceless, fill the air around you.
Sam: Audience, please. (cricket noises, laughter)
Matt: That works, I was going to look for cricket sounds here. That's also totally doable.
Marisha: Someone's got a really good one.
Matt: As you walk in, the actual dusk light that has permeated the Feywild begins to give way to the first signs of night. You can look up through the different breaks in the tree line, you can see stars for the first time. And you can see what looks to be a very dull white glow of moonlight hitting some of the trees and breaking through some of the treetops themselves. The underbrush itself is very soft and spongy, with a lot of leaves that have fallen and given this soft setup. As you guys push forward for another half-hour or so, you in particular, Vex'ahlia, come upon what looks to be a series of stones, what looks to be a series of small structures, almost. Not like buildings per se, but intently placed obelisks of raw, rough stone. And as you come across and look on that side, you can see what looks to be the base of one of the mountain spires that sticks out, a large cave.
Laura: Do I see any kind of markings on the obelisks?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Oh. Get out of here!
Matt: What'd you get?
Laura: Natural one.
Matt: Natural one.
Laura: I know!
Matt: They just look rough and old. They've been placed there. It's old magic.
Liam: God, you're so bad at D&D!
Laura: I suck!
Matt: But you do see around the ground right out in front of this cave what appears to be hundreds and hundreds of small objects, piles, what looks like fruits and flowers and bones and stone carvings, all sorts of things placed in front of this cave.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check on one of the bones to see if I can identify where it came from?
Matt: Okay. So you head out and take one of the bones and look at it. Go ahead and make a nature check.
Marisha: Yeah, the closest bone, I don't want to, ooh. Yeah.
Taliesin: That ain't nothing to sneeze at.
Marisha: No, it's not. 28.
Matt: 28. This bone belongs to a larger bird, like a great eagle, you can't quite specifically make out what it is, but it's been carved with small letters into it of a language you can't understand. It looks like it's some sort of a ritual item that's been placed there in the ground. But as you pick up and make this moment noticed--
Liam: I'm going stealth just because.
Matt: You all hear a giant, echoing roar coming from the cave.
Liam: Was I fast enough?
Matt: (roars) What'd you roll?
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30. Okay, yeah. You just (bip) out; you are gone. The rest of you are right at the outside of this small clearing where all of these small objects have been placed, you hear this rumbling loud roar come tearing through.
Marisha: I step back with the bone.
Matt: Okay. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Laura: I pull the broom out from behind my back.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Can I lean the bone over to Vex'ahlia and be like, is this Draconic?
Laura: Is it Draconic?
Matt: It is not Draconic.
Marisha: God fucking damn it.
Laura: Is it anything that I recognize, though?
Matt: What languages do you know?
Laura: Elvish, Abyssal, Undercommon.
Matt: No, none of those.
Laura: Shit.
Matt: However, at this time the trees behind you two, because the rest of you guys were staying back--
Laura: Who's you two?
Matt: Vex and Keyleth. The trees (fwoosh) shift and close off the exterior. As you turn towards the entrance of the cavern, you can see emerging from the front a giant-- it's hard to really tell the first moment that it appears, but you see what looks to be a gargantuan dire bear-like entity made of crackling blue ghostly energy, shimmering, translucent, not actually a physical form, but massive in size. (stomping noises, roar)
Marisha: Wait, did we get cut off? Did Vex and I get cut off from everybody else?
Matt: Yep. From everybody else.
Laura: Shit! I grab Keyleth's wrist and I fly into the air.
Marisha: I hold on for dear fucking life.
Matt: As you grab her wrist as you fly up, the trees, swoosh, close off and you go slamming into the tree boughs (crashing sound). You lose the broom for a second. Go ahead and hold your grip. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Laura: A strength check!
Sam: We can't even see them, Matt?
Matt: You guys can't see them and they just closed off in the trees.
Laura: Come on! Is that a saving throw or just a check?
Matt: Just a check.
Laura: Five.
Matt: Five? You lose your grip on the broom, and both Vex and Keyleth tumble down about 20 feet, you both suffer seven points of damage as you slam into the center of another pile of what looks like knick-knacks and things that are gathered on the floor. It's at this point that your mind hits that these are probably offerings, these are things that are left as some sort of offering to this bear-like spirit entity that exists in this cave. The bear, which is now, (stomping sounds), coming up towards you on the ground. Looks to Keyleth, (roars).
Marisha: Hi!
Laura: I cast Speak With Animals!
Matt: Okay, you cast Speak With Animals.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Like I taught you!
Laura: (weak growling sounds) (laughter)
Laura: And I say, we mean you no harm, great ghost bear! In fact, we brought you an offering and we just accidentally touched the other offering of yours.
Liam: Où est la bibliothèque? (laughter)
Laura: The cheese is old and moldy.
Matt: None of the bear's face moves at all, but an echoing voice, in Common, not animal speak, comes blasting into both of your minds, and those of you guys outside of the trees, trying to find a way through, also hear this echo, "You have entered the domain of Orlan. You destroy and disgrace that which was gifted. What do you offer in response to your travesty?"
Laura: Yeah, well, I--
Sam: We have a hat. A really good hat.
Marisha: I've got an old tobacco box I got from lost and found.
Laura: Ooh, yeah, that's pretty good. I offer him a tea set.
Matt: As you pull the tea set out, the bear claw reaches out and smashes it out of your hand and goes scattered and breaking across one of the stones and goes, "You walk into the realm of the wild, unwatched, unrespecting. The beasts of this land hold no kinship with you. You will prove offering yourself." And the tongue licks the lips.
Marisha: What? I turn into a giant scorpion.
Matt: The scorpion takes its form, as it does the bear, (growls).
Marisha: You want an offering, you can have mine.
Matt: Make a persuasion check on that.
Marisha: Oh god.
Liam: By the way, am I hidden in or outside?
Matt: You're outside.
Marisha: 21.
Laura: Good job, Keyleth!
Marisha: Thank you!
Matt: "I sense you have kinship with beasts. You may pass, though I will not forgive this infraction. You."
Laura: Yeah?
Matt: "You shall be the prize."
Laura: Oh, fuck.
Matt: The giant bear is looming over you now, and its size is so immense, probably 15 or 20 feet to the top of its shoulders.
Laura: Trinket! I call Trinket.
Matt: You call Trinket?
Laura: I call Trinket.
Matt: Leaps out of your necklace and lands right beside you and just roars, (roars) up to the spirit. The spirit pulls back, (roars), roars back. And Trinket is so tiny by comparison and is up to the elbow, but Trinket lashes out at the giant bear, just leaps up towards it, pushes into it and starts tearing at its throat. The giant bear takes Trinket with one claw and slams him into the ground. Trinket rolls and gets back up, (growls), you can see a little bit of blood at the corner of its mouth, and just lunges again, this time jumping up onto the bear's back and clawing up onto its, onto the top of its torso. The bear (growls).
Laura: He's pretty cool.
Matt: The bear head looks up at Trinket now gnawing onto its hide, (gnawing sounds), seemingly to no real effect, and the bear reaches up and grabs Trinket and plucks him off the side and sets him down next to you. The bear now begins to speak in the language of bears, which only you can understand at this moment, says, "You walk with this one. Is she your charge?" And Trinket voices back, you hear the (bear noises) up to the bear, as you hear coming out, "She is everything. Her life is mine. You take her, you take me, or we walk on and remember you as a kind soul." The giant bear looks down, "Very well. If you are at her side, I take your charge, as well." And the spirit bear steps forward, passing through you, and passing through Trinket's form, and what feels like this rush of warm air. And then disperses into a series of sparkles. You watch the energy slowly drift down and fade into the ground around you, and everything gets quiet. The trees slowly creak back and open the perimeter of this forest around you, leaving you alone. And Trinket comes up and licks your face.
Laura: Oh! (cheering)
Matt: As he's looking at you, you look down and you can see the necklace that you hold is actually shimmering with a blue light that passed through you, and it slowly fades to its dark normal form.
Sam: You're part bear now!
Matt: So. That's your new item card for Raven's Slumber. (cheering)
Audience member: What's it do?
Laura: I don't know.
Matt: So. I've got to finish this quickly because we've got to get to the Q and A, but as of this point in time, and I'll give you an ability card, but Trinket now benefits from your Hunter's Mark. (cheering)
Matt: And has an ability called Primal Fury you can use once per short rest that I'll get to next episode. As you all gather around this moment of silence, this quiet tension that has now dispersed, you see Trinket lift up Vex from the base of her cloak and put her back on her feet, nuzzles the side of her, and you can see the trees overhead open up a little wider than they were before, leaving some moonlight to hit the two of them. And that's where we'll go ahead and leave this session this week. (cheering)
Matt: Thank you, guys! (cheering)
Audience member: Is it Thursday yet? (cheering)
Matt: Thank you. (laughs) Thank you guys so much for joining us here live, this has been an awesome and incredible first experience for all of us. Thank you so much for tuning in and watching with us this week. We're looking forward to the GenCon show in a few weeks, so some of you guys over on that side of the US can hopefully come and see us here as well, and join in this fantastic energy that tonight was just filled with. So hopefully we'll do more of these as time progresses.
Travis: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Laura: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you Loot Crate for supporting us and being so awesome, being a fantastic sponsor, and yeah, I guess, is it Thursday yet? We'll see you guys in a couple weeks.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons! Tonight's going to be an interesting episode, but before we get to that, a couple of quick announcements and a couple of cool things we wanted to show you. One, our friend of the show, Kiki, who we saw previously made the awesome Fenthras bow replica for Laura over there recently decided to go ahead and also create Cabal's Ruin. Taliesin, do you want to come over here and try this on?
Taliesin: No, I'm getting into that.
Marisha: It is on your body.
Matt: Come attune to this shit, boy!
Marisha: Go sit in the corner with it for 30 minutes.
Liam: Put it on. Oh my god.
Travis: Stand in front of this table. Stand in front of this camera. No one can see you over there. Why are you getting totally naked?
Liam: It looks just like Tom Cruise's!
Travis: Stand over here!
Matt: Go over there.
Taliesin: Where?
Travis: In front of the table, you dicklord! Yes!
Sam: Someone get a camera on this guy.
Taliesin: I don't know which camera is--
Travis: Put your butt against this table! Kneel down, Taliesin!
Marisha: Taliesin, you work in film and TV. You know how this works! Get behind where we are.
Laura: No, he wants to be right there.
Taliesin: I know. (laughs)
Liam: Oh my goodness.
Taliesin: Our plan's going to go so well.
Matt: And she also made a fantastic replica of Whisper, the blade that was previously attuned by our dear rogue. Will you pass that over to Liam?
Travis: And will you hold up that mini?
Laura: You get to have that because you took two Vestiges.
Travis: This amazing mini was done by Eric Blumkiss-- I'm sure I'm messing up the name-- from Sweden. It's an incredible Grog mini that's so detailed and amazing, and I had to have it, so I promised our firstborn child to him.
Laura: Oh, good times.
Matt: That might make an appearance tonight as a proxy Grog for battle.
Taliesin: I would break everything on the way back here.
Matt: And also, since it was recently Sam's birthday.
Sam: What? A present for me? On stream?
Matt: It's from me and Marisha.
Taliesin: Happy pineapple day.
Sam: Oh, this is so exciting. What did I get? It's a great gift! Shirt-ception!
Marisha: Yay!
Sam: Part four!
Marisha: Must keep it going!
Sam: (yells) Oh man! This is the best gift! It's the gift that keeps giving.
Travis: The four of them stacked are pretty fucking incredible.
Marisha: I know, I think you've aged through the process.
Sam: Yeah. I'm going to take a picture of me. Someone can put that on a shirt. Oh man, this is amazing.
Matt: We are slowly folding into infinity. Sam's shirts will be the end of all existence.
Sam: That's so great. That's my favorite gift I've ever gotten.
Liam: That's what's inside the black spinning marble underneath Whitestone.
Sam: Oh man. Thank you, guys. That's so sweet.
Matt: Happy birthday, Sam.
Marisha: So sweet.
Matt: All right, announcements for the evening. First off, our fantastic sponsor Loot Crate is back. Sam, do you have anything?
Sam: I prepared a history lesson tonight. It's a history of crates. Ancient Greece: Zeus presents a lovely crate to the first woman on earth, a lovely gal named Pandora. It contained death and evil, corrupted the world forevermore. Egypt: 1957, the Ark of the Covenant-- sort of a crate; it carried the Ten Commandments-- is opened by Colonel Dietrich and Dr. Rene Belloq. Ghosts fly out, and it melts the faces of several Nazis, while Indiana Jones hides his face. Los Angeles, California, 1995: Rookie detective David Mills, played by Brad Pitt, receives a cardboard crate from murder suspect John Doe! It contains the head of his girlfriend, Gwyneth Paltrow. Your town, present day: you receive a small, expertly constructed crate that contains geek chic gear and apparel from The Walking Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween! Now, which would you rather get? The Ark of the Covenant? Pandora's box? A box with Gwyneth Paltrow's head in it? Or a Loot Crate, which you can use code CriticalRole to get 10% off your monthly crate. Guys, I think there's only one choice.
Marisha: That might be my favorite one. That might be my favorite one you've done. That was good.
Liam: We've got to slow you down or Loot Crate is going to poach you for ads.
Sam: That would be fine! I would much rather do these! I would do these for money every day! (laughter)
Matt: Curses! Thank you, Sam. And thank you, Loot Crate. Head up: me and Taliesin will be flying out tomorrow to be attending a convention this weekend called Another Anime Convention. Another Anime Con is in New Hampshire--
Liam: Florida.
Marisha: Boston.
Matt: No! I looked it up.
Marisha: You're not sure.
Matt: (giggles) We'll be doing panels and signings and all kinds of other fun stuff this weekend, so please come and say hi, ask questions, bring things to get signed. Come meet us; we would love to see you. It'll be a lot of fun. Also, Marisha, you have a new Signal Boost run coming up you want to talk about?
Marisha: Oh yes! We're doing a Halloween special edition. Two runs, starting Tuesday, and we're bringing back all the hosts! Taliesin and I are the first episode, and I know you guys love us, so for everyone who's like, "I'm not watching anymore because Taliesin's not the host anymore!" Now you should watch again.
Taliesin: I'm back. What are you going to do?
Marisha: You're good at the spooky stuff. You basically built our list. It was amazing. It's all good stuff.
Matt: Liam, you had a new project you want to talk about, as well?
Liam: Yes. I am continuing to be Doctor Strange in various Marvel animated things, and on digital HD, they've got a new animated feature called Marvel's Hulk: Where Monsters Dwell, and I am still the sorcerer supreme, where I say things like "eye of Tamagotchi" and "sphere of Esperanto" and other such spells. Check it out.
Laura: I'm in that.
Liam: Are you?
Laura: I'm in that with you.
Liam: Can you say who you are? Who are you?
Travis: How about no. Probably not.
Matt: The glory hosts of Hogwarts.
Laura: You'll hear me.
Liam: My name was in a press release. Laura will play some confident kickass someone or other. Like you do.
Laura: Whoa, that was double ones!
Matt: Good, you got them out of the way! Stop rolling, Laura. Save it for the battle.
Sam: Battle? Wait, we're going to battle?
Travis: Yeah, rap-battle.
Matt: I guess it depends. All right, so! Now that our announcements are out of the way, tension builds--
Laura: No! Gears of War came out this week!
Matt: Let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. So! Picking up where we left off, Vox Machina, in their journey to destroy the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of chromatic dragons that have torn through the Tal'Dorei countryside and taken up residence and calling it their domain, they've defeated Umbrasyl. They have their sights set on the next series of dragons. In the process of setting up a timeline in which they had to bait the white dragon Vorugal in the ravine outside of the ruins of Draconia, hopefully to jump on and destroy the dragon. They were approached in Whitestone by an individual that apparently was not Seeker Assum, an ally of theirs from long ago. Instead it was one of the dragons of the Conclave: Raishan, the green dragon, who had come to parley and actually offer an alliance, seemingly unhappy with the current set of rules and lack of interest from Thordak in making up his side of the bargain which was struck. Raishan has asked for your aid in destroying the swollen, dangerous red dragon. You guys asked, as a showing of faith, to have Raishan come with you to the ruins of Draconia, gather the Ravenites, and destroy Vorugal alongside you. As such, you gathered Lady Kima as an ally in this endeavor. You transported yourselves to the snow- and ice-covered ravine. Just now have taken up in Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion, and are laying down for an evening's rest. So. As you guys wake up the next morning, or before you do--
Laura: No.
Sam: We don't sleep?
Marisha: We don't sleep?
Laura: No.
Sam: Why're you waking me up?
Laura: Because I was thinking, maybe it's a bad idea to go jumping into this tomorrow. Don't you think maybe we should wait a day?
Sam: Sure?
Laura: I mean, we could watch Vorugal, see what's going on, see what his behavior is, and also prepare a little bit more with the Ravenites. But, that happening, you might have to inform them that he's not actually going to have a--
Sam: An attack?
Laura: Tomorrow.
Sam: But we literally just got back from telling them to be ready to move tomorrow morning.
Laura: I know.
Marisha: Percy, how are you feeling? You know, he seems all right.
Laura: No, he would have extra day to recover! Percy's not himself yet.
Taliesin: I am sleeping in the corner, I would assume.
Travis: He does look a little weak, even for his standards.
Marisha: A little pale.
Laura: I just don't think it's the best idea to jump into this.
Travis: (burps loudly)
Sam: So we have to go back and tell them--
Liam: Literally just got back.
Sam: And they were pissed. They were super pissed that we were there. We could go back.
Laura: Do you go back in the morning or do you go back now?
Marisha: I feel like time is of the essence here. Probably not best to wait until morning.
Sam: Tooma is not going to be pleased.
Marisha: Look, she already hates us.
Sam: That's true.
Travis: Yeah. Can't get any worse.
Liam: It could.
Travis: What, we're freeing them from a dragon. We are bearers of good tidings.
Marisha: Are we?
Travis: Yeah!
Marisha: (groans)
Travis: Now do we totally trust Tooma and the Ravenites? Do we want to give her all the details or just that we're going to be checking it out for one day more before we ring the dinner bell?
Sam: What are the details?
Travis: Well, if we have an extra day, what does that get us?
Marisha: We can maybe try and get Pike.
Travis: Ooh.
Marisha: Gives us an extra day for Pike.
Travis: How do we do that?
Sam: I don't know.
Marisha: I can go get her, theoretically, if we have an extra day.
Travis: Which I think we do. But I think we need you here, right?
Marisha: She does have the stone, right? She does have the stone? I think she has the stone.
Laura: Yeah, she has the stone.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: We're going to be setting a trap, right?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: So maybe we make that trap more better?
Laura: What exactly did you tell Tooma was going to happen?
Sam: Be ready to attack tomorrow morning. We're going to deliver a giant beast for the dragon to hunt, and that her people should be ready to strike. That's it.
Laura: Did you tell her to tell Vorugal anything in particular?
Liam: No, but we don't know if she has or not. They've got their necks on the line. I know they're not to be trusted, but they're in a precarious position, as well.
Marisha: Well, we don't want to necessarily have them jump in right away. We want them to set Vorugal on Yenk, correct?
Laura: Yes. Shouldn't she inform Vorugal that the monster is coming?
Marisha: Glorified messengers at this point.
Travis: Who's Yenk?
Laura: The big monster that we're setting for him.
Marisha: The goristro.
Travis: What's that? He's like a ram?
Laura: Yeah, a giant ram. Haven't you seen the picture? Did you see the picture?
Travis: No. I'm the only one that really appreciates pictures, and I haven't seen it.
Marisha: Oh, that's unfortunate.
Laura: I'll go grab the book from Percy as he's sleeping.
Taliesin: Roll for it!
Sam: You don't get to say roll!
Laura: You don't get to say roll for it!
Liam: I've said that, and he's ignored me, so you don't get to say shit!
Taliesin: Matt! Dad, make her roll for it!
Matt: For?
Laura: I'm just trying the big book of beasts away from Percy as he's sleeping.
Sam: He's not sleeping on it, is he?
Taliesin: It's in my possession.
Matt: Make a perception check with disadvantage.
Taliesin: All right. That'll do.
Travis: Say it so confidently.
Laura: Subtract some, because you're still really tired from being dead!
Taliesin: That's disadvantage.
Matt: And minus two on both of these rolls.
Taliesin: Oh, and minus two. That's 14.
Matt: Yeah, she slips it off you.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: This is what you see.
Laura: That's what we see, Grog!
Travis: Wait. Is that like this, is it like me?
Sam: We don't know! We haven't seen this thing.
Matt: It's clustered around a bunch of other art pieces of other demonic-looking entities, and it is by and large about twice to four times the size of anything else on the page depicted.
Travis: That's really big.
Marisha: Two Grogs? Is it like two Grogs?
Matt: There's no picture of Grog in there. You have no sense of scale.
Sam: Quick! Draw a picture of Grog, and then we'll know.
Travis: I'll draw it full scale! I put my hand on the page.
Laura: Oh, he's tiny!
Travis: Yeah, I think he's hand-held. Maybe we need like a few Yenks. Everyone can do with a few Yenks. (laughter)
Liam: Jeez. We're all about to die tomorrow or the day after.
Travis: Wait! Vax and Scanlan, when you're within, did you see Vorugal in your travels?
Sam: No, we kept out of sight in the caverns and Vorugal we don't think saw us, but we also didn't see Vorugal, either.
Travis: Do you think you could replicate your path in the daylight?
Laura: I think he would see them. What if you became a fly or something and flew down? Would he notice you?
Sam: Wouldn't see me. I don't want to speak for Vax, but if we're going back tonight, you no longer have the ability to fly, is that true? But you do, Vexy?
Laura: I do. And I can speak Draconic.
Sam: Oh, yeah. Well, that would've been helpful last time, actually.
Laura: Sorry. I didn't think about that last time.
Sam: But yes, if I were a fly-- I assume any of us can avoid his detection if we stay low and invisible. Well, yes.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Right?
Laura: Can you make me invisible?
Marisha: I can't. He can.
Sam: I can make you invisible.
Travis: Are we going to go now, or are we going in the morning?
Laura: We'll pop down tonight to talk to her one more time.
Travis: All right.
Marisha: So you're telling them?
Laura: Hold off a day. She's going to be so pissed.
Marisha: Are we going to go back and see them again? Okay, we'll just say: next morning, then you go say, "hey, we got an awesome thing for you." Okay.
Travis: Yeah. If we're summoning a few good Yenks, do we have a spot that we want to say stay away from?
Marisha: Well, they gave us a location of the stones.
Sam: She told us to release Yenk--
Travis: Oh, on the summoning stones.
Sam: The summoning circle or something like that. All right?
Travis: I've got to go pee.
Liam: Also, when we were there, we weren't allowed to bring any weapons in, so you're going to have to dump--
Laura: Nothing?!
Sam: I'm leaving mine in the mansion.
Laura: (groans)
Sam: Bring something that you don't mind putting down.
Liam: Yeah, don't bring your best.
Laura: Fenthras.
Sam: No, leave that at home.
Liam: I'll take it. I'm not going to use it; I don't know how! Barely. Woo-hoo!
Laura: Now you've got three Vestiges! Should we go, then? Can you make me invisible and we go?
Sam: I can make you invisible. You can fly us down through the cavern, but you're going to have to be super stealthy.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Sam: Okay. Don't know how that'll work if we're flying, but okay. Doesn't that cover our tracks? Oh, that's the stealth rolls thing? Okay, good. Wait, Keyleth, will you hold onto my Mythcarver sword for me?
Marisha: Sure!
Sam: I can trust you.
Marisha: Of course! (giggles)
Sam: Oh boy. That's a big smile.
Marisha: You can trust me.
Sam: Okay. Don't kill anyone with it.
Matt: Keyleth finally has a Vestige.
Marisha: I do! I was the last one, you guys! It feels-- doesn't really feel like anything.
Laura: Once you attune it to yourself--
Marisha: Sure.
Liam: Scanlan feels the same way, don't you Scanlan?
Sam: I feel nothing. Sometimes I have to hold it with my left hand so it feels different.
Marisha: I switch hands. (laughter)
Marisha: Still nothing.
Travis: When you call it the stranger--
Matt: So as you cast Pass Without a Trace on yourself and Scanlan, the shadows of the mansion cling to you a little darker, a little more crushed. You wish to cast Invisibility on Vex, you said?
Sam: Yes, I will use yet another 3rd-level Invisibility spell to make us both invisible.
Matt: All right. You both jump onto the back of her broom.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: And just to double check here--
Travis: The way he said that--
Laura: No, he said it really terribly.
Matt: What do you mean? I didn't say anything!
Travis: You sure did.
Laura: Sure did!
Matt: I'll say technically you're carrying the broom, so the broom will also be invisible. Okay, so as you're holding the broom, you both leap onto it, the two of you and the broom vanish, and you guys are free to exit the mansion at your disposal.
Sam: Yeah, so we made a right here and left here and right at the big rock.
Laura: Is anybody going to keep track of us like you kept track of Vex-- Vax. I just called my brother me. I just did that.
Sam: Vex is the girl one. Vax is the boy.
Laura: Is somebody going to be around in case something goes horribly wrong?
Liam: I'll go with you if Kiki wants to turn me into a crow or a fly or something. I'll stay back and watch.
Laura: Stay up like Kiki did before.
Marisha: I mean I could do what I did before and follow you as Minxie. Worked last time. I still have my one last shape, as well.
Sam: Isn't Minxie big and spottable?
Marisha: It's a mountain-based tiger. I'm a white snow tiger.
Sam: That's so hot.
Marisha: It's actually very cold in the mountains. That's why they have thick coats.
Travis: You don't think Vorugal is going to think that's a midnight snack?
Marisha: Who, me?
Travis: Yeah, you. Big white tiger?
Marisha: He didn't see me before.
Travis: Oh okay.
Marisha: Let me see something. Hang on, because this'll tell me because Polymorph-- you might go out of my range. Is the only problem.
Sam: Polymorph just lasts. Wait, no.
Matt: Nope, concentration.
Sam: So he has to stay within range.
Marisha: Range is 60 feet.
Matt: No, that's just to cast it. I'm pretty sure he can go off on his own as long as you maintain concentration.
Marisha: Okay. Can I? He can go. Do you want to go? All right. What do you want to be?
Liam: Something white.
Laura: Something very small. Like a moth, a white moth.
Sam: It's got to be something that can go as fast as we're going.
Laura: He can sit on my shoulder. No?
Liam: Yeah, but then if you guys get fucked I'm dead, as well.
Laura: I'll just smack you and then you'll become you again.
Liam: So it'll just be like every day. All right, yeah.
Marisha: It's true.
Laura: Right? If I smack him, it's not going to kill him, he just turns back into--
Sam: If he were a black crow or something he could fly back on its own. A moth can't travel a mile.
Laura: Make him a white crow.
Liam: Yeah, can you make me an albino crow?
Marisha: Sure! I don't see why not.
Sam: With one yellow eye and one black eye.
Travis: Oh get on with it, fuckers! (laughter)
Marisha: I do that. With one yellow eye and one black eye.
Matt: All right. And as your form shifts to the first probably albino crow to wander the landscape here in Wildemount, you are able to follow them, should you so chose.
Marisha: To match Vex, I give him one little blue feather, just off the side. Little blue streak.
Liam: A little bit; this isn't Percy's, but (caws). (laughter)
Taliesin: (caws)
Laura: Come on, let's go. Come on.
Sam: All right, let's go.
Matt: You guys make your way outside into the heavy snowfall, across the top of the ravine. You go ahead and make a survival check to try and follow the tracks of Minxie to the outskirts of where you guys were last time.
Sam: Do I also get to give her any assistance, like "we went this way, go that way?"
Matt: Yeah. You know what, giving you the assist, go ahead and roll with advantage on that.
Travis: Oh, that's lucky.
Sam: Dice jail already?
Laura: Yeah. Definitely already. 17.
Matt: Okay. Takes you a little bit of time, but you manage to find your way back through the heavy snowfall. It's freezing cold and your teeth are starting to chatter a little bit, but you manage to make your way to the top of the ravine, dipping down where you find the cavern entrance at the bottom, leading into where Tooma and rest of the Ravenites at least seem to have the central portion of their society within the mountain itself. You guys come down. It's a little warmer the further into the rock you travel. The snow turns to slush, then to damp ground, to dry rock and stone.
Laura: I get off the broom and put it behind me.
Matt: Okay. Both still walking invisibly, with you now (whoosh) walking behind them, hopping as the white crow.
Sam: We should do the same thing we did last time. I know you weren't here. We turned visible, asked to guards to go-- It's going to be really shitty when we get in there, because she's going to hate us.
Laura: All right. Ow! Fuck you! Stop it!
Sam: I will drop invisibility. Are the guards around?
Matt: You guys are just on the outskirts of the entranceway.
Sam: Oh, we'll stay invisible until we get to the guards.
Matt: To the center of the town, or outside of Tooma's--
Laura: Oh! I thought we were already in the cave.
Matt: You're inside the cave. There's a path in there and it opens up into the actual subterranean village, and then in there, across from this fountain area, is where Tooma's tent is.
Sam: Where did we meet the guards last time?
Matt: As soon as you entered the main village area.
Sam: That's where we want to meet them again.
Matt: So as you both drop your invisibility guise, with your white crow friend hopping behind you, the same two guards are still patrolling. Only one of them notices you. Turns around and gives an odd look, his head cocked to the side as he grabs his spear and puts it towards you again.
Sam: Yep, same routine. We'll leave our weapons here. This is my friend Vex. We'd like to see Tooma again. I know it's very upsetting that we have to make these night calls like this but it's very important.
Laura: I speak in Draconic. I say  Sorry, my friend rambles.
Liam: (hacking spit)
Laura: My broom takes off behind me.
Matt: Yeah, exactly. Vanishes forever. Keeping the spear there, yells out (foreign word), and the other soldier who's wandering, turns around, looks and sees, steps over, puts his spear down, and they both have a conversation briefly. You can, as I recall, speak Draconic and can read lips, is that what it was? Yeah. They're both discussing why these stupid people keep coming back and bothering Tooma, as well as the coming tension of tomorrow's activities, and how they can't keep interrupting Tooma if she's going to be keeping her mind straight. But one of them leaves. The other one steps, circles around, and begins nudging you both forward, telling you in Draconic, "Then go, make it quick."
Laura: We will.
Matt: As you guys stay at the outskirts of Tooma's tent, the interior light has been sufficiently dimmed, as it was before, with a little bit of the embers that are still there in the fire pit in the center. Now, barely cracking ember. Tooma is passed out and curled up inside her throne-like chair, as one of the other dragonborn soldiers comes over and nudges her gently, "Tooma. They return." She rakes towards his face. He barely ducks out of the way. Unnatural speed for a creature as old as she is, per se, but then the hand recoils back with a snapping sound, and she wakes up, "You come again?"
Sam: Yes. We offer profound apologies for waking you from your slumber again.
Matt: Snaps her arm back into place. (cracking)
Laura: In Draconic  we apologize for waking you up. Unfortunately, I sent my brother here before with our compatriot, and he spoke out of turn. We're actually planning the attack the day after tomorrow.
Matt: (sigh, foreign words) Which you recognize as, "Tell the others: wait a day." And one of her servants wanders off behind you guys and exits the tent. She turns back to you. "Then what is to be done?"
Laura: We'll be releasing a very large fiend.
Sam: At the spot where you told us.
Matt: "At the stones, yes."
Laura: The stones. We hope that you will inform Vorugal that it's going to happen. He'll head over, fight-fight-fight. He becomes much weaker, we jump in, fight-fight-fight.
Matt: "It'll be done. Do not mess this up."
Sam: Question, before we go. Typically when you've done this in the past, you inform Vorugal and he heads on over right away? Does he need to see evidence of a hunt? How does it work? Do you typically inform him?
Matt: "I do not inform. Skork does the informing."
Sam: Skork?
Laura: Yes, Skork. I remember him.
Sam: And is there some sort of hunt horn or anything that signals the beginning of this, or does it just happen?
Matt: "Depending on where the prey is, whether it be nearby forests or presented in chains to the cinder stones of which I've sent you, Vorugal begins the chase."
Laura: He won't be in chains, exactly. Is that all right?
Matt: "Just keep it there."
Laura: Oh, okay.
Sam: I don't want to mess this up. If Vorugal were to see anyone near this summoning circle, would he be suspicious, or would he be okay with it?
Matt: "If it is not a Ravenite, it would probably make them part of the hunt."
Sam: Okay. Good to know.
Laura: Good news. Good. Great.
Matt: "Is that all?"
Laura: That's all. Be pleased. We will see you in a couple of days.
Sam: There's like a 50/50 chance we'll come back again tonight.
Laura: No it's not. We're not.
Sam: No? 60/40.
Laura: Let's just go.
Sam: We're out of here.
Matt: "Leave me!"
Sam: Sorry.
Laura: Again, I apologize for my brother. He's an idiot.
Matt: She doesn't even pay you guys any mind, just curls over, takes her heavy robes and like wraps them around her and curls up into a small little bundle of old dragonborn woman. The rest of the soldiers close in, cutting you off from her, and they all give you the very stern look that you have seen many times that tells you, "get the fuck out."
Laura: Okay. You make us invisible?
Sam: Oh yeah, invisibility yet again. I'm out of 3rd-level spells.
Laura: Is Pass Without a Trace still active on us? It's up to an hour.
Matt: Yeah it'd still be active.
Liam: As they're leaving, not wanting to get left out, I fly down from the air and land in my sister's hair and like a cat (growls) into the top of her head five or seven or 12 times.
Laura: Thank you.
Liam: (caws)
Marisha: So tangled.
Matt: Instantaneous bedhead. You can't even see it, but you can feel it and it bothers you. All right. You guys both are invisible, the bird clutching to your side. You take the broom back up into the snowy storm. I need you both to make stealth checks with advantage.
Laura: I thought we were invisible. We're invisible.
Sam: Yes, I've made us invisible again.
Liam: Big bonus.
Laura: Okay, stealth checks.
Sam: With advantage?
Laura: Plus ten to whatever you roll.
Sam: Oh snap! 12, 22--
Laura: 36.
Sam: 24.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way up out of the ravine, up onto the top of the snowy banks at the top of where the cliffsides are. Eventually, over the next 20 or so minutes, finding the shimmering outskirts of Scanlan's doorway, joining the rest of the party.
Laura: Get the fuck off my head, you piece of shit.
Matt: Polymorph lasts for how long?
Marisha: An hour.
Matt: As soon as you get to the top of ravine, the white crow (impact) face-down in the snow.
Marisha: I think it's an hour.
Liam: Speaking of which  hold still, there's a little bit of bird shit right there.
Laura: Aw, I thought you were serious.
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: Thankfully, that doesn't transform, either. (laughter)
Matt: You make your way back into Scanlan's mansion.
Marisha: While they were gone, I, with Fenthras and Whisper, was playing make-believe archer Vex, like a 12-year-old in the bedroom with a Nerf bow.
Matt: As you enter the front of Scanlan's mansion, you see Keyleth in the corner, who's pulled Whisper back in Fenthras, and it goes (dagger impact) into the wall.
Marisha: It worked! How did it go, guys?
Laura: Give me the bow, right now.
Travis: Oh, busted.
Marisha: It might be like a cool combo move.
Laura: I'll think about it. Thank you.
Travis: She take it well?
Laura: She did! She said she'd wait.
Sam: She's a night person. She's okay.
Travis: Great.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You did catch on the way up, Vex, that even through the dark sleet-covered snow blaring night, there is the faint hint of light blue sunrise in the distance.
Laura: Oh shit. Day's coming. We didn't sleep! We need to sleep!
Travis: Wait! Should we see if we can get Pike first?
Sam: First? Do we have any spells to do that?
Marisha: I can try and scry.
Laura: What if you take the stone, pop over to her, then use Tree Stride and come back?
Marisha: That I can do, yeah.
Sam: You have another Tree Stride in you? Didn't we get here today?
Marisha: We did, but if I burn a higher-level spell, then yeah. What does it matter, at this point?
Travis: Yeah, let's get all our ducks in a row.
Marisha: All right. I'll be right back. See you guys in a minute.
Liam: Bye! A minute passes.
Marisha: A minute passes. This is like when you walk the same direction, you say bye, and then you walk the same direction to the car.
Matt: Awkward quiet. You hear Kima snoring with her back against the foyer wall, just (snoring). Until eventually, the stone begins to glow and pulse like a dull frozen heartbeat. (pulsing) Keyleth, your eyes open, and you see it flashing in your hands again, and you look up real fast and before you can say anything, your mouth opens to say goodbye before she vanishes in a swirl of glitter and blue light.
Laura: Oh shit.
Matt: Now, Pike! Come sit down! (cheering)
Ashley: Hello!
Marisha: I like your jacket! It's really great.
Ashley: Oh hi! Okay.
Matt: Just flew in.
Ashley: Yeah. Here we go. (laughter)
Matt: So. As the day has gone by and through the chaos of getting Whitestone ready, trying to assemble the followers of Sarenrae that you've gathered, and protecting the remnants of the city as Vox Machina went off, a moment hits you and you close your eyes and pray to Sarenrae and hope that all shall be well with your friends, and you wish that you could be there to help them. And there's a sudden warmth in your proximity, and then a sudden flash of blue light, and then nearby, you see a somewhat cold, damp Keyleth just appear in the space next to you as you're preparing to lay yourself down for an evening's rest, it being later at night now, clutching the stone.
Ashley: Hey! I was just about to go to bed!
Marisha: Were you sleeping? This is so awkward!
Ashley: I was just saying my prayers.
Marisha: Oh my gosh.
Ashley: I do it as much as I can.
Marisha: You know, I never thought about having poor timing with these gate stones. I'm so sorry!
Ashley: (stammers)
Marisha: I thought you were on the toilet.
Ashley: I know. I'm so glad I wasn't.
Marisha: Yeah, me too.
Ashley: I'm so glad you're here.
Marisha: I missed you.
Ashley: I missed you.
Sam: We saw her literally today.
Marisha: Yeah, but it seems like I went around the world and back!
Ashley: I was thinking today and I was like, "Oh man, I should've just gone with them."
Marisha: Yeah, we got all the way there and we were like, "oh, we forgot Pike!"
Ashley: I know. It's okay.
Marisha: Do you want to go?
Ashley: Or I will be there now. Let's go.
Marisha: We can go now.
Ashley: Let's do it.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: Is that a new set of dice?
Ashley: I had to go buy some because I left all of my stuff in New York. Let's see how this goes.
Sam: You stopped on the way here to buy dice?
Ashley: No, I got those a little earlier. We're okay. We're here. Okay.
Marisha: Okay. So we Tree Stride back.
Matt: Okay. Pike, you gather your materials, your armor, your weapons. All things that you feel would be necessary for this type of a conflict. You rejoin with Keyleth. The two of you find your way back to the Sun Tree.
Marisha: Right. So yeah, so the leader of Ravenites, her name is Tooma, and we went there, and we were talking to her, and I think we have a plan, but not really a plan, so we're going to figure it out as we go. All right? Let's go. That's the plan; you're caught up.
Ashley: Okay, great. Hey, guys. (laughter)
Matt: So as the spell finishes, the Sun Tree opens, you step through the portal into the slow crawling sunrise. The sun hasn't quite crested, but you can see through the snowfall, which is lessening at the moment, the distant light blue is getting lighter and lighter. You probably have another 30 minutes before the sun hits the actual horizon line. But as you step out of one of the trees that you created previous, when you had journeyed to the ruins of Draconia, you do see about 150 feet off, the shimmer of the outside of Scanlan's mansion door.
Marisha: (whispers) Let's be quiet, okay? Let's do this.
Sam: Oh, great. Pike's good at quiet.
Marisha: We stealth there.
Matt: Both you guys roll stealth checks.
Sam: Oh Jesus.
Liam: This is so great. Now we can all die together!
Matt: You have disadvantage, Pike.
Marisha: Oh, that's a natural one.
Sam: Wait, what?
Ashley: I don't think I can get worse than that; that is a one.
Sam: Two natural ones?
Matt: Two natural ones?
Marisha: No!
Sam: Oh my god. The dragon's going to fucking kill us right now.
Marisha: Oh my god, Pike. The plan hasn't even started!
Laura: Dice jail!
Liam: We're all about to lie down for a three-hour nap. What are you talking about?
Ashley: Off to a great start.
Matt: As you guys begin stepping through the snow, Pike, you take a step and you hear this strange (cracking) sound and you feel this slight shift beneath your feet. And you watch as some snow begins to trickle off the side of the cliffside.
Marisha: Pike?
Ashley: I'm going to not move.
Marisha: I don't move, either. Do we not move or do we run?
Ashley: We should run. We should run because it's probably coming down!
Marisha: Run! (laughter)
Matt: As soon as you both push off running, (whoosh) a portion of the cliff actually shears off and begins to slide down the side. Pike, if you could go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw real fast.
Laura: Oh my god, Matt! Why are you trying to kill her right when she gets here?!
Sam: Yeah, Matt. Why did you roll two natural ones?
Ashley: Wait, what did you say it is?
Travis: A dexterity saving throw.
Matt: A dexterity saving throw.
Ashley: Wait, I get nothing, okay. A four.
Matt: A four. You begin to see Pike slide down off the edge.
Marisha: I cast Grasping Vine to grab onto her.
Matt: With that, some of the reeds, some of the nearby frozen plants on the edge that were largely covered with snow that were revealed as the rest of the snow began to crumble off, a large vine shoots out, wraps around you, and pulls you back up onto the side of the cliff: fine. The rest of the rock and snow and ice, you hear (crashing) clattering into the ravine below.
Ashley: Go!
Marisha: Go!
Matt: All right, you guys run. You see the doorway shimmering before you, you get closer and you hear in the distance, this strangely familiar distant echoing (growls).
Ashley: Aw, come on! What is that noise?
Marisha: Go, run!
Matt: You both just get to the doorway in time. The snowfall's still there though gentler than it was in the night. You both dart inside, slamming the mansion door behind you, into a warmer, comfortable, quieter atmosphere. (panting)
Ashley: Hey!
Laura: What just happened?
Liam: Jeepers.
Travis: Hey!
Ashley: Hey!
Travis: Hey, buddy! Why are you out of breath?
Liam: You all right? You look white as a ghost.
Taliesin: Have I had a full night's sleep, at this point?
Matt: No, not yet.
Taliesin: Goddamn it.
Marisha: Dragon might know we're here.
Travis: What, why?
Marisha: Well, there might've been a rockslide. And it might've been our fault. I'm not sure.
Travis: You just walked through a tree. Why was there a rockslide?
Marisha: I don't know, Grog!
Liam: The door is easy to see.
Sam: The door is shimmery and shiny?
Matt: No, nobody can see through it.
Marisha: They can see a shimmering door.
Matt: Only if you let them. Only individuals that you choose can see the entrance.
Laura: That's great!
Ashley: So whatever that was just saw us disappear.
Laura: Oh shit! Grog! Open the door! Dust of Tracelessness! Out the door! Right now!
Travis: Oh! Yeah, I open the front door and I take big handful of the Dust of Tracelessness and I (whack).
Matt: Okay, make a strength check. There's a mild wind here you're fighting against with dust, so we'll see.
Travis: 14.
Matt: 14? Okay. You take a big old heaping handful and (whoosh) another one. As you send it out there, all the snow crusts over and any signs of footprints, both half-elf or gnomish, turn into a gentle, untouched solid surface of snow, as you begin to hear in the distance another echoing (growl).
Travis: What is that?
Ashley: What is that?
Laura: Close the door.
Sam: Close the door.
Laura: Close the door, Grog!
Travis: I just want to see what it is!
Ashley: I slam it shut with my gauntlets.
Travis: Hey, pushy!
Ashley: We don't know what that was! Well, maybe you do, but I don't know.
Marisha: I'm assuming that was Vorugal.
Sam: The dragon.
Travis: It's a dragon.
Ashley: It's a dragon!
Travis: Yeah, a big white dragon.
Marisha: Big white. Big dummy dragon.
Travis: And you let it know we're here! (chuckles)
Ashley: Well, that was an accident. I was going to surprise you guys. And we almost died.
Travis: But hey, we're not, so we need to get some sleep, right?
Sam: Yes, everyone sleep now.
Travis: We sleep.
Matt: Okay. You guys all go to rest?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right. A full rest is taken for all of you. Everyone's healed back to full. Spells are recovered. Percy, you are now down to a minus two, I believe, penalty to your rolls.
Liam: Wake up and it's two in the afternoon?
Matt: Technically, yeah. It's mid-afternoon by the time you guys finish your full rest, except for Percy. Percy is up before everybody else and is pacing about the mansion by himself probably.
Sam: The mansion will last 24 hours, so it'll be dark again by the time it wears off, so we can stay in here as long as we need to.
Liam: All right.
Sam: But do we have things we need to accomplish today?
Taliesin: How about making a quiet cavern, not too far away from the summoning circle, where we can hide?
Laura: That might be smart, actually.
Marisha: At the pace in which that cliff fell apart last night, I don't know about the structure of the topography here.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Laura: But we're also up high and the ravine is down low. That could make a difference.
Liam: Yeah, we could get piled on.
Laura: Oh! I understand.
Sam: But with Percival's engineering skills, he could maybe find a good little spot of granite for you to dig into or something.
Marisha: I can try and do a Commune With Nature and see.
Travis: These islands float, right?
Matt: Oh, they once did. All the islands of Draconia were disabled, the arcane essence that let them stay up, and they all crashed into the ravine.
Liam: Also, when shit goes down, we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past. A) we don't want to teleport inside the dragon's belly.
Sam: I'm keeping all options on the table.
Travis: Only stupid people do that.
Liam: Clearly. B) We don't all want to be all grouped together.
Laura: We don't want that.
Liam: I'm eating one of these magic candies.
Laura: Those chicken candies?
Liam: Yes, there's chicken. We want to spread out so we're not all blasted at the same time.
Taliesin: Vex and I at a distance.
Liam: Separately, though, so you can hit from different angles.
Travis: So two caves? Four caves?
Marisha: I'll have to think on the caves.
Sam: They don't have to be giant caverns. It's just a little nook. A little foxhole.
Liam: Cubby-holes. Up high for anyone who can take to the air, down low for anyone who can't.
Marisha: Honestly, I'm not going to know a whole lot until we scout out the location.
Taliesin: Let's go scout out the location.
Sam: Okay, how do we do that? In broad daylight.
Marisha: I've got something I've never done before!
Laura: What is this?
Sam: It's called Invisible Reconnaissance.
Marisha: Almost. It's called Animal Shapes. And it's basically Polymorph, but for all of us. I can turn us all into whatever we want.
Laura: So we don't just look like cows.
Laura: We are cows.
Marisha: We are cows.
Travis: Quick question. In all of our time here, when we were scouting before, and when you two jokers were going to go see Tooma, did we see a bunch of animals around?
Laura: I have not seen very many animals, I don't think.
Matt: Within the ravine, there's been very few. What animals you have seen have been a few flying owls, other carnivorous birds that are generally scavengers. You've seen maybe a few small wolves that are picking through the ruins and eventually scattered off. White snow wolves.
Travis: As long as being animals isn't going to make us a mid-day snack, versus being Ravenites.
Sam: I will say this  I love the sound of this spell, but wouldn't travelling mist be really undetectable? Could we mist around?
Marisha: It's almost debatable. Because we look like an unnatural mist.
Sam: There's a snowstorm out there. We're just going to be one with the clouds.
Laura: Is there a snowstorm?
Matt: If you guys glance outside of the mansion and look, it is not a snowstorm, but there are heavy winds. (wind blowing) You can hear multitudes, a cacophony of off-harmonies of winds, of different portions of the distant ravine that are all howling together. There is a faint snowfall, but the clouds are dark and heavy, and more of a storm coming your way.
Laura: Does snow get thrown up to the wind?
Matt: A little further down in the ravine, it does.
Liam: And as long as we're not synchronized swimming in mist form and spread out, then it should be fine.
Laura: Behave like wind, you guys.
Travis: Can we do both animals and the mist?
Matt: No, they both require concentration.
Sam: My worry about animals is don't we also have the intellect of the animals that we become?
Matt: Actually, Wind Walk is not concentration. In theory, you could do both. Wind Walk is not concentration.
Marisha: We can be misty animals?
Matt: You can be misty animals.
Marisha: That's dumb. (laughter)
Marisha: That's a lot.
Sam: So we keep our own intellect?
Marisha: We always keep our intellect. Animal Shapes last for 24 hours.
Taliesin: Can you go back and forth?
Marisha: I'm going to find that out right now.
Taliesin: That's a question.
Marisha: Because if we were a flock of birds, Vorugal's not going to give a shit about birds.
Sam: A flock of hawks, they don't go together. But a flock of pigeons do, or a flock of geese.
Taliesin: I don't want to be food. I want to be something that eats.
Liam: While they're debating, I pull Whisper out, and I chuck it into a wall and teleport to it. I pulled it out of the Blink-Back Belt.
Matt: Yeah. So you chuck the dagger. As you're talking, you watch as Vax takes the blade, flings it across the room. It slams into the side of the foyer. You look back to where he was, and he's not there anymore. There's a flash of dark shadow energy where the blade is, and Vax's form appears right there, holding the blade where it landed in the wall.
Laura: That is so cool!
Liam: It didn't go into my belt. I went into the wall, and I'm holding it, still. I was a shadow for half a second, and I traveled with the blade. I am fucking Nightcrawler. Holy shit. And I throw it again across the other side.
Matt: Okay. This time make an attack roll because you're excited, not concentrating.
Liam: Okay. Sure, that's 27.
Matt: Yeah. It goes a little more elevated, lands about ten feet up. As it impacts, you guys watch. As he releases the blade, his form almost is pulled along, almost like it's caught on a tether and then just turns into dark smoke and vanishes with the blade. As the blade sticks into the wall, he reappears at the side, clutching the edge, and you drop a few feet and land onto your feet.
Liam: Aw, suck it haters! This is the coolest dagger I've ever had!
Sam: Tell me this, can you not do that? If you throw it and don't want to travel where it is?
Liam: I throw it right next to his head, and I don't go anywhere.
Matt: Roll an attack roll.
Sam: Go right in my neck.
Liam: 24?
Matt: 24. (dagger impact) Right next to him.
Liam: Does it go to my belt?
Matt: It returns to your belt.
Sam: Oh! You get to choose?
Marisha: That is awesome.
Sam: Maybe don't ever do that again, please.
Laura: Sure you're okay, Grog, that you don't have the dagger? I know you wanted it.
Travis: I just want to be able to move faster, but it's all right.
Liam: We can't all be all things, Grog. You are the strongest thing on the planet. You are going to take Vorugal all by yourself--
Travis: Yeah, if I can get next to him.
Laura: Which he probably can't.
Liam: You shut the fuck up, you trouble-maker. You bust my balls on a daily basis. What is that about? What is that about? What have I ever done but support you?
Travis: Pipe down! Calm down! Listen, how are we getting down there? Can we hurry this up, please?
Liam: Throw my dagger at the ceiling. Travel with it.
Matt: All right, so you watch his form vanish again. About 40 feet up, (impact).
Liam: Can I land on my sister?
Laura: On me?!
Matt: Make a dexterity saving throw. This would be acrobatics, right.
Laura: What about me?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: I was looking straight at him.
Liam: I rolled a 27.
Laura: Perception? 20.
Matt: You make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: (sighs) You piece of shit.
Liam: Quit starting with me.
Laura: Dexterity. 28! 30!
Liam: 30. She beat me.
Matt: She dodges right out of the way, and you slam onto the ground. You feel your ankles and knees (ping) a little bit. That sharp pain hits you in both joints and you're like (moans).
Liam: Worth it. (groans)
Marisha: So anyway. Back to the plan-- (laughter)
Marisha: So with Animal Shapes, I can actually decide what animals each of you can be, so we can all be different animals. Furthermore, on my action, I can use it to transform you guys into a different creature.
Laura: That's pretty cool.
Liam: I like how excited you are about this.
Marisha: I'm so excited.
Laura: I'm wondering if the mist form would not be better. But the animals are really cool.
Taliesin: Can we go in and out of mist form? That's a thing we can do?
Sam: It takes a while, but yes.
Liam: But we're not in the middle of a fight, hopefully. The animals, Kiki, save it for a rainy day?
Marisha: All right.
Laura: If we're not all dead come tomorrow.
Liam: Yeah, we probably all will be dead tomorrow, but it's a really cool idea.
Marisha: Thank you for your validation.
Sam: Two questions. Are we all going? And question two, when we get there and find a suitable location for carving caves, are you going to do this right now, or are we just scouting?
Taliesin: We're going to do this, as well.
Sam: We're going to do this right now?
Marisha: I imagine it depends on how scouting goes.
Sam: Well, we can't communicate when we're in mist form, so you just have to go do if you feel it.
Laura: Maybe scout and then go back. Because mist form stays for eight hours, so at least that way we can communicate not next to Vorugal.
Taliesin: If we scout and it's clear, and then we come back and then go back, it might not be clear again. If we scout and it's clear, then we do it. It's done.
Matt: You guys hear this faint gargling sound as Grog is currently gargling his own spit and staring at the ceiling.
Liam: I didn't follow that, either. We should do something.
Marisha: All right, let's go scout. I cast Wind Walk on everybody.
Matt: Okay. All of you begin to feel your form buzz a little bit with the instilled power of wind. As you all each step out onto the snow on the outside of the mansion, you can concentrate for a moment as your form then meshes into a mist-like billowing cloud.
Laura: Do we look natural?
Sam: Yeah, what do we look like?
Laura: Do we look pretty obvious?
Sam: Are we a yellow cloud, a white cloud?
Matt: I'd say it's more of a whitish cloud. I wouldn't say it's supremely obvious right now, but the wind is pushing you about a little bit. If you try and focus direction of move, you can get a better idea how well your movement is.
Taliesin: I'm trying to move in a very windy way, yeah.
Travis: And Kima is with us?
Matt: Kima is with you, yeah.
Liam: I am the fart.
Taliesin: I am the fart.
Matt: Kima, as you guys are doing this and it gets cast, Kima goes, "So what am I doing?"
Marisha: Do you want to come scout? We're going to scout. Or you can just stay.
Matt: "You know, I'm going to stay. You've got a big kitchen here."
Marisha: It's mainly filled with chicken.
Matt: "I love chicken." (laughter)
Travis: There's also a training room several levels down if you want to go smash some shit.
Matt: "I'm going to get some chicken, and I'm going to go smash some shit."
Marisha: And there's the spa under that.
Matt: "I don't think I've been to a spa. Does that also have chicken?"
Laura: It could if you wanted it to.
Ashley: You could bring it down there.
Matt: "This is the best place ever!"
Sam: It is. It really is.
Matt: "Come back when you need me." She goes and runs off to the kitchen area. All right. You guys, stepping out, keeping the focus on the spell, you move half-speed through this weather in mist form. So your 300 feet per round speed, whatever it is, is reduced to a mere 150 feet.
Marisha: It's okay. It's more for appearance.
Matt: What are you guys doing? Are you coasting through the ravine, are you heading directly, or trying to go overhead?
Marisha: I want to go to the summoning stone. I'm going towards there.
Sam: But we discussed before we left that we would mainly stick to the lowlands and the ravine to get there, yeah?
Laura: Yes, we did.
Taliesin: Hugging the walls, looking normal.
Marisha: Sure. I follow the crowd.
Matt: Okay. Who's leading?
Ashley: I am! (laughter)
Laura: I'll lead the way.
Liam: This is the quietest you've ever been.
Taliesin: I volunteer as tribute!
Sam: Shouldn't Laura lead?
Taliesin: Let Laura lead.
Matt: Okay. So Vex and Pike are leading the way.
Ashley: No, I was kidding.
Taliesin: Too late. No take-backs.
Travis: We all die together.
Matt: As you guys slowly drift down into the bottom of the ravine on the outside of where the mansion doorway is, you crest down to where a large portion of the rubble is currently buried by snow and ice. The wind is whipping snow up into the air, and you're finding little spirals and little snow devils that are making their way through as different clusters of wind tend to swell and subside. You make your way over to the opposite side of the ravine and start heading to the north way, crawling around.
Laura: I'm going to keep an eye out to make sure nobody seems like they're-- especially towards Vorugal's plateau to make sure he's not there.
Matt: Need you to go ahead and make a perception check if you could. And I need everybody to make a stealth check, please.
Marisha: Do we get some sort of bonus because we're mist?
Laura: Perception is 30.
Marisha: Jesus.
Ashley: How can you be loud as mist?
Liam: Natural 20!
Marisha: Stealth and what?
Taliesin: Just stealth for us.
Sam: Do I get to add Jack of all--
Matt: You can. As long as you're not trained in it, you can add it to it.
Sam: I'm not. Okay. 18.
Taliesin: 16.
Marisha: 14.
Matt: 20.
Laura: 15.
Ashley: Eight.
Travis: Four.
Matt: Okay. It's fine. It's a group check, so successes outweigh the failures. You guys as a group begin to move forward. It's fine. As you guys are slowly moving your way, you keep an eye out. You can see there are some Ravenites in clusters that are out, currently poring through the rubble. There are crews that are basically excavating, trying to pull out what's worth anything from the remnants of Draconia. You make your way around this large, familiar curvature from before that leads towards the center area of Vorugal's now-claimed lair at the bottom of the ravine. As you turn the corner and you guys keep watch, you can see on the icy platform, with these spikes that jut out at various places throughout this larger central area here. On top, you can see perched and curled up the massive form of the white dragon itself, claws curled up under its chin, its chin slightly turned askew to the left, eyes closed, wings wrapped up around and gently flapping over the sides of the top of this icy platform. It sits there quietly, breathing in, and you can hear the breath itself, deep and guttural, just echoing. (snoring) The wind occasionally sneaks in and seems to almost carry the echo farther than it should be audible. And you can see there are two packs of about five Ravenites that are armed and are sitting at the base of the platform, that are looking out. Some of them are sitting, some of them are eating some small rations, some are just keeping an eye out. These appear to be essentially assigned guards to Vorugal here at his lair. So. You guys continue past?
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Matt: Heading which direction?
Laura: Towards the summoning circle.
Matt: You recall which direction that was?
Liam: It's east.
Matt: All right, so you head a little northward, following the curvature of this part of the ravine in an eastward direction. Eventually, you all move past an uncomfortable proximity of about 200 to 300 feet of Vorugal, seemingly not catching anyone's attention as you slowly move, following the pattern of winds. It takes you a little longer to get through, but you figure it's best to look as natural as possible with the moving terrain and weather. Eventually, you turn around and begin making your way eastward, away, following where two more portions of the ravine clump together. Anywhere between 80 to 100 feet in width, it expands a bit, shrinks in a bit, but it seems to be pushing into a very slight grade upward, like this portion of the ravine is making its way, over probably the next mile or so, to breach and hit surface.
Liam: So from Vorugal?
Matt: From Vorugal, heading eastward, it is slowly heading up. You get about a quarter-mile in before you begin to see the very thick ice being broken by occasional snow-covered dead trees that are breaking through. As you saw before, there are not a lot of trees in this central area of the ravine, but they're becoming a little more common as you progress forward, though many of them dead, thin and broken in places. Make another perception check, Laura.
Laura: Okay. 16.
Matt: Okay. It's fine. Pushing forward in your mist form, you do see that certain portions of the upper ravine have an element of erosion to them that have broken down, and there are some large stones that have dropped and are jutting out of the ice formation on the snowy platform floor. You glance around, and you can see that there are a loose circle of maybe five, six stones forming an oval shape in the center. And even looking about, you can see this area seems to have seen some scuffles. It looks like portions of the walls have been scraped and clawed apart. It looks like some heavy impacts have hit the side. If there was a place for there to be a setting ground for some sort of a conflict of previous hunts for Vorugal, this is probably what Tooma was referring to.
Laura: I look down towards it. Does it look like anything is around it?
Matt: Currently, no. It looks pretty--
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Ooh.
Laura: Oh no! Tree's down!
Liam: It's an earthquake. The trees fell down! Keyleth! Your spells are too powerful!
Marisha: (laughs) I can save them! I can save them all!
Sam: Wow, Matt.
Ashley: It's so pretty!
Laura: It is so pretty.
Matt: This circle of stones here--
Ashley: Did you make the--
Sam: It's Arendelle!
Liam: He's been carving it this week.
Matt: So this circle of stones, the clusters of rock that have broken down and are sticking out, you don't know what the cultural significance of them are. They appear to have been there for a long time; these were not a recent series of landmarks that were presented here. These have been here for a while. But you do see a series of claw marks and damaged bits throughout the space in the area that is uncharacteristic of the rest of the ravine floor that you've been traversing.
Sam: Can Vorugal see this spot?
Liam: Curved away?
Matt: You make a perception check, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, I'm great at those.
Liam: We just traveled about a half-mile?
Sam: Six!
Matt: About a quarter mile. You don't see Vorugal from here, so probably not.
Laura: I would be looking for Vorugal too, though.
Matt: Perception check.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: From this perspective, it's a little ways in the way the ravine has crawled in this northeastern direction from where the lair center was. This area is not directly visible from Vorugal. You cannot see, for quite a bit, that area.
Liam: Wind fingers for Vorugal.
Laura: All right. Can I float down and get a closer look at the weird marks you were talking about?
Matt: Yeah. Make an investigation check.
Sam: While she's doing that, I'm going to fly through Pike a few times.
Laura: 13.
Matt: It tickles. But not in a good way. Glancing about, you can see there is some snowfall here and some ice that has sealed off this area. A lot of the snow that's hit here gets blown away by the wind that's coming through, so there hasn't been a lot of snow packed in this vicinity. A lot of these large claw marks are indicative of dragon claws, especially those of an ancient size. You do see bones scattered about-- many of them have been picked clean-- of varying sizes. There appears to be a half-eaten large insect-like carapace that's shoved off to the side. A number of creatures have fallen here and have been mostly eaten, devoured, or left to be picked apart by the other birds of prey that exist in this area.
Taliesin: We have cover from either side of the top. That's right. I'm going to fly over to the top of the far right of the ravine.
Laura: Behind those rocks right there?
Taliesin: Above them, all the way up here. And I'm going to take a look around and see if anybody, anything's around, anything living that looks suspicious.
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: You'd think I'd be able to do this. 18.
Matt: Okay. Glancing about, you can see every now and then, a few birds fly overhead. Appear to be hawks, light gray in color. They're just looking around, circling and vanishing in the distance. You do see a few small furred critters; looks almost squirrel-like, but it's too far away to make out the details, and you're not very specifically detailed-- make a nature check, actually.
Liam: Check for critters.
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: You have no idea. It's furred, it's small. It probably creeps you out a little.
Marisha: (giggles) My friends.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to survey. Would I think it's safer above the ravine or within?
Matt: I'd say within here, it's probably safer within the ravine, up at the top. This is not indicative of the true height; we'll say this is more of an example. The ravine height is probably closer to maybe 80 to 100 feet up.
Travis: Yeah. Got it.
Matt: I just didn't want to build Styrofoam that high.
Taliesin: Actually, that works out perfectly for me. Then I'll jump down to behind that rock and I will de-mist behind that rock.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'll see him doing that and join him.
Marisha: Yeah, I'll watch as they do that.
Taliesin: I think a cave entrance right here to somewhere where you can hide after you do the summoning and dive in and get about 25 to 30 feet away.
Sam: Question, Percy. There's this annoying wind. (laughter)
Liam: Vax flies around them.
Taliesin: I'm not responsible for what you ate for breakfast.
Sam: Here's a question. Rather than scouting here, digging a hole, and going back to our mansion, should we just have a new mansion here?
Taliesin: Yes, that's actually-- well. Kima.
Sam: Kima.
Taliesin: That's all right. Somebody can mist back and bring her.
Sam: I could technically drop that mansion and she'd be on her ass. (laughs)
Taliesin: I think she's already so delighted with you. That might be a terrible idea.
Sam: Well, someone could go back and get her. We don't have to do this right now, but when we're done here, maybe we want to camp here so we have a place to hide inside a mansion.
Taliesin: That's a very good idea, actually.
Sam: And we don't even really need to make tunnels, do we?
Taliesin: We do. We want to have places to hide.
Sam: Yeah, that's true. We want to spread out.
Marisha: I'm going to mist down next to them.
Taliesin: We want to have a place to hide, and place to shoot from that has cover.
Marisha: Hey, guys. What are we talking about?
Taliesin: Digging a hole and moving the mansion here.
Marisha: (laughs) God, so windy tonight.
Sam: I know, it's so annoying.
Taliesin: It also means that if something goes horribly wrong, you can run downstairs and hide.
Marisha: All right, well, here's the problem. I need to figure out what all of this is made out of. I can't work with it if it's just ice. It has to be natural stone. So cover for me? I'm going to drop down and start meditating.
Sam: I'm going to scan the sky.
Marisha: I'm going to do a Commune With Nature spell. Do we have any other questions, before I do this, that we want to ask the land?
Travis: We're wind; you're good.
Matt: Everything seems fine.
Laura: We're still wind.
Marisha: In general, I guess.
Taliesin: How strong are the ravine walls, and can we dig into them, as well? Not just the ground, but the walls themselves. Small tunnels, just big enough for one person.
Sam: And there's these rocks here. We know there's some rocks. We knows that there's tons of ice.
Marisha: Do I need to figure out how far exactly Vorugal is from us?
Sam: We saw him on the way over. We know exactly where he is.
Marisha: I have three good questions.
Liam: Weather forecast is not a bad idea.
Marisha: No, it's not. The weather forecast.
Taliesin: Yeah, for tomorrow.
Sam: What sorts of things can you ask nature?
Marisha: Nature-y things. I can ask it about--
Liam: Where's the closest Erewhon?
Marisha: Yeah. Is there a Starbucks nearby?
Matt: Three questions. What you got?
Marisha: Oh, I was asking-- yeah. I can ask it about topography, I can ask about locations of people nearby. Things like that.
Laura: Ask about what the rock is, so you can find where to dig.
Taliesin: And where's the green dragon.
Marisha: Oh, that's a good idea. Where the fuck is Raishan? Okay.
Laura: She might be with us right now.
Marisha: She might be. Okay. Now I do this.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: First and foremost, what is the geological makeup of this land around me? This ravine. Cliffside.
Matt: What is the geological makeup?
Marisha: What is it made out of, yeah.
Matt: Stone.
Marisha: And all of this stuff on the edges?
Matt: All of this is stone with about a foot layer of ice on the outside of it. Portions of it that have been broken or struck, you can see some exposure to it. This ravine is not normally covered in snow and ice; Vorugal's presence has brought a persistent blizzard and icy atmosphere to it. So all the ice and snow you see here is technically not natural to the terrain, and most of this ravine has a very strong foundation of solid stone, natural rock, and other various geological layers beneath.
Marisha: So it is fairly sturdy and not apparently going to collapse at any moment?
Matt: Correct. It appears like what happened with you and Pike earlier was an anomaly that only happens when you roll two natural ones.
Marisha: Sure. Okay. Can I get a sense on what the weather is going to be like for the next 24 hours?
Matt: Reaching out to the vicinity and picking up what you can, it's hard to get specifics, but it looks to be at least a coming sleet storm. Not hail; nothing too heavy, but it looks like it's going to have some times of limited visibility, and very cold.
Marisha: Bummer. Okay. Good to know. And do I sense Raishan?
Matt: Within three miles? You get the essence of the surrounding terrain that there is another large dragon presence nearby, though you don't get a specific location.
Marisha: Bummer.
Taliesin: It was a good thought.
Sam: No, that's good to know.
Marisha: She's within three miles.
Laura: She's here, or it's Thordak.
Marisha: Well, no, he's said another, aside from Thordak.
Liam: Aside from Vorugal.
Matt: No, you asked for Raishan. Raishan was confirmed to be within the vicinity.
Marisha: Okay. That's it. Those are my three questions.
Matt: As that question fades, you do get a little better bit of location of Raishan's current presence. Raishan is currently on the very south end of the ravine, on the outskirts of the three-mile radius of near where you are right now. Close to where you guys first came to the ruins of Draconia, where you were first discovered by the Ravenites. That's all you know about her. Just that location.
Marisha: Close to the ruins of Draconia?
Matt: Where you guys first arrived when you first came here.
Liam: Not near us right now.
Marisha: And not where the library and the ruins of Draconia were.
Matt: Yeah. South of all that.
Taliesin: All right. I like the idea of someone going back to get Kima. I think one tunnel on this side, one tunnel on the other side, and one tunnel on the top of the ravine on either side, if you can do that.
Marisha: And do we want them to connect so we can get through? Little half loops, semi-circles?
Sam: Does this make noise? Will it vibrate the ground?
Marisha: I'm pushing out earth. Yeah.
Taliesin: Not a ton of noise.
Marisha: Vex and I mentioned that.
Taliesin: How loud will this be, do you think?
Marisha: How loud will this be?
Matt: As loud as moving large pieces of stone and earth would.
Travis: Loud.
Matt: Not stealthy work.
Sam: We saw a storm coming. Has it hit yet?
Matt: No, you've got a few more hours.
Sam: We can wait until the storm comes. It'll be super windy and loud.
Travis: Not nearly enough to move tunnels of earth and rock.
Sam: Can you do something to ice? Melt it? That's silent.
Marisha: Yeah, but it's only a foot of ice.
Sam: Yeah, but we could carve out ice tunnels.
Liam: No, the ice is only a foot thick, coating what is normally a temperate region.
Travis: We got the house. We got the mansion. That's it.
Liam: But it's one spot.
Sam: We can hide behind rocks.
Marisha: We could do a test.
Sam: Can you make new rocks that are hollow? I guess it'll still make noise.
Marisha: I could make walls of stone. I can make little-- But also keep in mind, anything that I do, he'll notice. And the whole point to this is to not make our presence known at all.
Laura: And ice dragons burrow. I remember that much.
Marisha: So we could pop in our tunnels and they could be like, "what's up?"
Sam: How important are these tunnels? Because if we want, while you're doing this I can go distract the dragon?
Marisha: On the other end of the ravine?
Sam: Sure, why not?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: No.
Travis: Why would you do that?
Sam: To distract the dragon so you can dig.
Liam: Because we can use your mansion, and when the time is right, we can all scatter in different directions quickly. Many of us can fly. I would rather have these cubby-holes, as well, but it's too risky, and it's too risky to let you go running your little ass off around and get that dragon to eat you in one bite. You're overruled.
Travis: How do we go get Kima?
Laura: Somebody that can turn invisible has to go get her.
Marisha: Well, you're still mist-form. That lasts for eight hours. You can mist back.
Laura: Yeah, but she can't turn into mist, so you can go get her and turn her into mist.
Sam: We have the stones. What about the stones? Stones. Someone can mist back with the stone, then mist back to us and give her the stone.
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: That'll work.
Ashley: I'll do it!
Sam: Ooh!
Travis: Wait! Does the stone make any sound or light?
Taliesin: No, just goes poof.
Travis: Really? Then sure.
Taliesin: Little bit of a poof.
Laura: It's a little bit of light, but we can hide behind something when she does it. She can poof from within the mansion before you make the mansion.
Travis: She can poof from within the mansion.
Taliesin: You can't poof within the mansion.
Matt: You can't poof within the mansion. It has to be on the same plane of existence.
Laura: But it's daylight, so it should be fine.
Marisha: The mansion's considered a pocket plane.
Sam: If Pike is going back as mist-- no offense, Pike-- can you find the mansion?
Laura: Why don't you go with her?
Sam: Okay. Gladly.
Ashley: Oh, okay. You'll know your mansion better.
Travis: Send the two bitties. And we're going to hide out. I'm still in my mist form.
Sam: Did you guys de-mist-ify?
Laura: Well, we've been talking, so I'm going to say yes.
Sam: Hey, clever elves, can you scout around, make sure we're not being watched?
Liam: There are no elves here. My mother was a human. Do you want to go right now?
Laura: I've been keeping an eye out, but yes, I will keep watch.
Sam: We're not being watched? You sure those hawks are hawks?
Laura: Is anything watching us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 28.
Matt: 28? Looking about, there are a number of birds in the distance. There's some that have flown overhead since you've been here. Nothing that seems to be acting erratically or out of the ordinary. There's a couple that have come in a little close to watch, and then went off their own way, curious as to what's going down in the ravine.
Liam: Those are some birds.
Laura: I think we should all be mist, though, while we wait for them to get back. Just in case.
Taliesin: I'm going to spend some time in this form just studying to see if there's anything odd about this circle at all. Studying the stones.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Where is the circle? Oh. Thank you.
Matt: Right, so Pike and Scanlan, you guys go mist form, make your way over back towards where the mansion was placed. Takes you a while. Are you going through the ravine, or are you going over the ravine?
Ashley: Over.
Matt: Okay. So the two of you guys coast up to the side and over the top of the wall. There is some heavy dead forest area here, but you coast on the side of it, keeping an eye down. Both of you guys make a perception check.
Sam: Terrible. 11.
Liam: Ashley's got this.
Ashley: 21.
Sam: Ooh, my girl!
Matt: As you guys are pulling around and the weather has gotten a little better for the moment; the storm hasn't hit yet. Pike, you glance off and you can see some stirring down in the bottom of the ravine. You see two white wings (wingbeats) and you watch as Vorugal takes off like a bat out of hell up out of the ravine, past both of you, and you can feel the wind shake and the actual ravine quakes slightly at the presence as Vorugal shoots up into the air, spirals up, then wings go out and then coasts off westward, away from you guys.
Marisha: Oh, away from us?
Matt: Away from you guys in a western direction.
Ashley: Away from them, too?
Liam: Away from us.
Marisha: He's going west.
Liam: We're east.
Ashley: So you guys are fine.
Taliesin: Wait.
Ashley: I try to make wide eyes.
Marisha: (gasps) Does this mean we can dig?
Laura: Did we see him go in the air from where we are?
Matt: Make a perception check, actually, Vex.
Ashley: We should take his loot.
Travis: (laughs) Yeah. That ends well.
Laura: 20.
Matt: You do hear what sounds like heavy wings echoing through the ravine towards your direction. You see a faint movement in the sky, and then it vanishes and you hear the sound getting more and more distant. You gather Vorugal has at least left the lair. You're not sure how long.
Laura: I come out of mist form. Vorugal's not here right now. If you're going to dig, do it. I'll keep an eye on the sky.
Marisha: What do you guys think, should I do it? Over the earpiece.
Travis: No.
Taliesin: I think we should.
Travis: No.
Taliesin: I think two crow's nests for the shooters.
Laura: Do it quickly, if you're going to do something.
Taliesin: I draw out, really quickly in the snow--
Laura: I draw out an intricate map. Blueprints.
Matt: Meanwhile, Scanlan and Pike, you guys make your way back to the mansion? Coasting over, you find your way. You make your way into the mansion. The servants are rushing two platters out of the kitchen down to the stairs that lead to the subterranean portion of the mansion.
Sam: Okay. Kima, sorry to interrupt lunch--
Matt: You come downstairs and her armor is off, her maul's at the side. She is on the ground in the process of doing one-handed push-ups and scarfing chicken with the other hand. She's getting ready for a fight today.
Sam: Disgusting.
Ashley: That's amazing!
Matt: She stands up. "Damn right, it is. Stringy."
Ashley: We came back for you because he's going to build a mansion somewhere else.
Sam: We need to move.
Matt: "Okay." She takes one of the pieces of chicken and pockets it.
Sam: That will disappear when we leave here.
Matt: (groans) Pulls it out. Sucks it off the bone and throws it to the ground. It clatters off to the side. "All right, let me grab my stuff." And she goes and gets her armor and starts putting it on. "Do you want to help me?"
Ashley: To hold some stuff?
Matt: "Put the armor on! You know to put on plate. Come on." You help get her armor on.
Sam: Do you need me to help, as well?
Matt: "No!" You help her get all armored up. She gets the rest of her stuff. She came relatively light, other than the materials she needs for combat. She's ready to go in the next 15 minutes or so. "All right. So. Where's this going down?"
Sam: I produce one half of the stones that we brought, and I say-- oh wait, does she know how to do this? I guess you just think, right? You just think. You have to think. I know that's hard, but you're going to have to hold this rock and want it to be reunited with its pair. I'm sorry about that. And then you'll be bamfed back to where we're going, all right? Here, take this stone. All right, so we'll just step out of the mansion. I won't drop it yet, because there's no need.
Matt: All right.
Sam: And we're going to mist back, but after she's bamfed. All right. So think happy thoughts, click your heels together.
Matt: Steps out in the snow, crunching sound of her boots, closes her eyes for a second, opens one back at you, Scanlan. Focuses and concentrates. The minute progresses. She clutches it and touches the actual stone to the outside of her holy symbol. You see the small platinum outline of Bahamut's head. As it hits, it begins to glow. The blue glow is also surrounded by the bright white glow of Bahamut's light, and as her outer form begins to shimmer, it blinks out with a spiral of a glittery white light dust, and her form has vanished.
Ashley: She's the coolest.
Sam: She's okay.
Ashley: She was doing one-handed push-ups and eating chicken in the other.
Sam: Can you do a one-handed push-up?
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: Can I see?
Ashley: Yeah. (laughter)
Matt: And with those gauntlets, she does easily, fully armored and all. She's leaving this little Pike shape in the snow right there.
Sam: Can I try a one-handed push-up?
Matt: Make a strength check.
Sam: Seven. (laughter)
Matt: (grunts) Two-handed push-up.
Travis: On his knees.
Sam: I'm carrying a lot of stuff. Without my gear, I could probably do it.
Ashley: I understand. You're also carrying a mansion or something.
Sam: Yeah. Magic weighs on you.
Ashley: Magic weighs a lot.
Sam: All right, let's go.
Matt: All right. You guys mist back, begin cresting over to return.
Sam: Scanning the skies for any sight of a flapping white dragon.
Matt: Okay. While that's happening, what are you guys doing?
Taliesin: I'm making ice plates.
Laura: I'm keeping an eye out for Vorugal or anything suspicious.
Marisha: I guess I'm making tunnels.
Matt: Using Move Earth?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Let me see here. Move Earth is you can reshape any dirt, sand, or clay in the area. Not stone.
Taliesin: Not stone?
Matt: Cannot manipulate natural stone or stone constructions.
Travis: Or a budget rental center. (laughing)
Laura: So you can make walls.
Taliesin: Can you manipulate ice?
Sam: She can manipulate ice.
Taliesin: Can you manipulate ice?
Marisha: I can melt ice.
Taliesin: But you can't create ice.
Laura: Even if she did, it has to be something not noticeable.
Taliesin: I think that we could--
Marisha: I can make some more plant life.
Matt: Do you have Stone Shape prepared?
Taliesin: Stone Shape?
Marisha: No.
Matt: Yeah, Stone Shape would've been the spell to use in this circumstance.
Marisha: Cool.
Taliesin: If we pull some of the ice, I can try and make sheets of ice--
Marisha: But how long does Stone Shape last? I thought it was just for a little bit.
Matt: Stone Shape is instantaneous. It just affects something.
Marisha: I know, but how much? It's only like a five foot cube, right? So I can't make a tunnel.
Matt: Not a heavy tunnel, no.
Marisha: Right, so no.
Taliesin: We can alter the topography just a bit by taking out some of the ice and then opening it up to make hiding places.
Marisha: I can make a little trench, like a trench wall-line for you guys at the top of the ravine, for the shooters.
Liam: Yeah, half-bubbles almost.
Marisha: Yes, exactly.
Travis: 80 to 100 feet up, right.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Laura: Yeah, I can shoot from that height.
Marisha: Right along the ledge.
Laura: Actually, after you do it, I can try to disguise it, so it's not seeable from the air.
Matt: Okay, so what are you doing? You're making a small ledge?
Marisha: So yeah, I'm going to do Wall of Stone. Fuck.
Taliesin: We don't need a ton of space, because we're never going to move more than six.
Marisha: Yeah, I basically want a little almost half wall for cover here and here, just extending the stonework.
Matt: Just out this way?
Marisha: Upwards. So that they can--
Matt: Oh, okay, I see.
Taliesin: Give us cover.
Marisha: Do the Gears of War.
Travis: Can I raise a point, Taliesin? Do you have anything to keep you from falling if he attacks you on that ravine?
Taliesin: It would be hard to fall if he attacks us. The best thing, actually, if he attacks us up there would be to jump.
Matt: So you're using it twice? Then over here, you said?
Marisha: You know what, let me flank it. Let me do one on that side and one over here. Yeah? You think?
Sam: Why a hundred feet up?
Travis: That's how tall the ravine is.
Sam: Can we just do 20 feet up?
Taliesin: You have a broom. I have a rope.
Marisha: Is this excessive?
Sam: Yeah! Why a hundred feet? Why not 20 feet? Why not 30 feet?
Laura: We can't do it in the middle of the stone. We have to do it at the top.
Sam: Why?
Matt: You could, technically.
Marisha: I guess I could, actually, because I can do a flat one. Okay. All right. You know what, I could make little pod bubbles for you guys on the half edge of the cliffs.
Taliesin: Make some pod bubbles.
Marisha: I'll do that.
Travis: Aren't those going to be obvious?
Taliesin: I'm going to start pouring water on this stuff, and it's going to be ice again so quickly.
Marisha: Yeah, if we try and camouflage it. Spend the rest of the day camouflaging it.
Taliesin: I've already started working on camouflage--
Marisha: The DM keeps looking at us like we're crazy.
Matt: I'm trying to figure this out, guys.
Marisha: All right. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to make (stammers) little balconies.
Liam: Spit some lyrics, girl.
Marisha: (giggles) So smooth. Yeah, little balcony ledges that they can go on.
Matt: Okay. We'll say...
Laura: He's like, "I spent a really long time carving this shit, you guys, and you're going to be altering it."
Matt: It's all good.
Liam: Is there any point to having you sharpshoot from behind that wall down below?
Matt: So right there is what you're saying? A little shelf.
Marisha: Yeah, little ledge. Yeah, a balcony. I want to make a cliff balcony.
Matt: How far up?
Taliesin: I would take it to the far edge. Even further.
Liam: If we're fighting, I'm not bound by shit, man. I can be anywhere.
Matt: Where do you want this to go, Marisha? Right there?
Marisha: One there, and one-- yeah.
Matt: Okay, so those are the two.
Marisha: And about what, 40 feet up? 50 feet up?
Taliesin: I'd say about 50 feet up.
Marisha: How about halfway up the mountain? I want to make it look rough, I want to try and camouflage it, and then I'm also going to help Percy and the rest of this excavation to use my Gust and little Create Water spells over top of it to start covering them with ice.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm creating a breakable ice shield for when it's time, but I'm just giving the nice cover.
Marisha: Yeah, cover it with ice to make it look like the rest.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and just roll a wisdom check. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: He normally only asks me that when we're making a terrible plan.
Taliesin: I know. Ooh! Check out the big brain!
Marisha: Check out the big brains on Brad! 23.
Matt: Okay. As an Air Ashari, you have a very firm understanding of airflow, temperature of air, and how best it can quickly freeze water. Over time, utilizing the spells at your disposal, over the next 30 minutes or so, you do manage to coat the visible recently created stone with a layer of ice that in some regard would help, hopefully, camouflage it.
Marisha: Oh, he let us do it!
Taliesin: I'm just going to spend all my time also trying to keep hiding it, keep reinforcing it. Once the mansion's available, I'm going to take water and slowly add layers.
Matt: Okay. Scanlan and Pike, you guys do manage to return, as you watch the party preparing these small little ledges outside of the ravine interior.
Sam: Hey, guys. Did you see the dragon leave?
Laura: I saw him fly away, yeah.
Sam: Should we be concerned at all?
Laura: That what? He's going to get help?
Liam: Well, maybe.
Sam: That he's going to meet up with Raishan? And fuck us?
Marisha: He was heading west, right?
Taliesin: Which is not the direction where Raishan is.
Marisha: Raishan was south. She was far south.
Travis: Can you do your detect dragons thing?
Laura: I guess. Yeah, I can.
Matt: Kima, at this point, by the way, has been off to the side, keeping watch, goes, "You guys expecting anyone?"
Sam: Oh shit.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Matt: You see Kima drops the maul to the ground and points down. And you see, stepping up from the ravine from this side, this way, you see a small, stout-looking dwarf character walking up (footfalls). Bulbous red nose. You can see a thick winter coat over, cloth tied over the top of the head, a crossbow to one side. Walks up and goes, "Hey. Larkin, the one you hired. The mercenary to help you with this exchange."
Sam: We hired somebody?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: When was this?
Laura: Back in Whitestone. We hired somebody to come help us fight.
Sam: We did? Why on earth would we do that? We're super strong.
Marisha: I kick Scanlan a little bit.
Sam: Oh shit. Sorry.
Matt: "So. Glad we've all gotten together. I see you've begun your plans, so tell me. What is your plan?"
Marisha: Larkin, was it?
Matt: "Larkin, aye."
Laura: Larkin, do you have any spells you can use?
Matt: "I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, aye. Let's see how it pans out."
Ashley: I'm going to talk to him in Dwarvish, and I'm going to ask where he's from.
Matt: Okay, you ask him where he's from? "I don't feel comfortable speaking our language in front of people who don't understand it. It's impolite."
Marisha: She's good.
Laura: It is quite impolite.
Matt: Watch as Larkin's expression gets very dire for a second like, "what are you doing?"
Laura: I whisper to Pike.
Travis: Larkin, are you ready to help us kill a dragon?
Matt: "That's what you hired me for, isn't it?"
Travis: Aye. Don't you think dragons are just the biggest dick-fucks ever?
Matt: "To be honest, yes."
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Oh! Oh, Larkin!
Laura: Just fucking got it?
Sam: Oh, yes! I totally remember you, Larkin!
Marisha: I kick Scanlan again, for sheer joy this time.
Taliesin: We're setting up camp. The attack begins tomorrow morning. There's going to be a beast. There will be a fight.
Liam: Yeah. We kind of have a plan, but fucking dragons.
Taliesin: We'll see how it goes. We're going to try and tire him out.
Matt: "All right. I'll keep an eye."
Taliesin: Once he's tired out--
Matt: "So I'll go on your signal, then?"
Sam: Will you be joining us here at the battle or providing support from afar?
Matt: "I'll be providing support from a comfortable space."
Sam: What kind of support? Long-distance attacks or healing?
Liam: What's your style?
Matt: "Oh. Let's just say, in the beginning I'll go ahead and bring some pain from a distance and only close that distance when things get real nasty and hot."
Sam: And Larkin, the reason we hired you, now that I remember, was for your extreme knowledge of dragons and their behaviors. Tell me this: should we be concerned when this one leaves his lair about hobbling its lair or somehow preventing it from returning?
Matt: "Do you know when it's returning?"
Travis: No.
Sam: Well, we know that it'll be coming here for a fight.
Matt: "If you don't know when it's returning, don't step into its lair."
Sam: Is there a way to prevent it from getting back to its lair?
Matt: "Killing it."
Travis: Real simple answer, I think.
Taliesin: It's not like a vampire.
Matt: Kima leans into you Scanlan, "Who's this?"
Sam: Mercenary.
Marisha: Larkin.
Laura: We hired him.
Travis: Yeah, he's a real dead-eye.
Taliesin: There's also going to be a field of--
Sam: Ravenites.
Laura: Potentially.
Liam: Yeah. Told you it was complicated, yeah?
Matt: Kima crosses her arms for a second. "You also told me you had another ally coming."
Sam: We did?
Taliesin: We did?
Taliesin: I wasn't there.
Sam: Who?
Travis: We have a hard time keeping track of everyone that we hire and fire.
Taliesin: That's why it's going to be a great plan.
Sam: You know why? We have Pike! That's our other ally. She's here now.
Ashley: Here I am.
Matt: "I'm so confused right now."
Travis: Yeah, it's all right. Listen, all you've got to do is smash dragon with us tomorrow, yeah?
Matt: "Which dragon?"
Travis: The white one.
Laura: The white one that's here. That will be here.
Liam: The only one that's here.
Taliesin: Let's make the mansion right now. Please make the mansion.
Sam: I'll make the mansion behind a rock outcropping. Kima, I need your help to make sure I'm not spotted while I do this ritual.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: So this is great. Tomorrow, you pop in, you summon, we all pop back into the mansion. We're hiding in the mansion while the fight's going on.
Sam: Well, someone has to be on the outside watching to find out what's happening.
Laura: Right.
Marisha: Should we have someone near where the dragon is, so we can get eyes?
Sam: Someone who can be invisible, someone who can be a hawk or Ravenite?
Liam: Scanlan, what are you going to do? You going to pop this thing out and then hop in the mansion?
Sam: Tomorrow, we're talking about? Yes, absolutely!
Laura: So Keyleth could be a hawk over by Vorugal--
Marisha: Watching?
Laura: Is there any way to let us know, though?
Taliesin: Not if we're in the mansion.
Marisha: Yeah, because the earrings don't work through the mansion, right?
Matt: From the inside to out, no. They have to be in the same plane.
Sam: Well, someone would have to be next to the doorway, pop their head in and say, oi, it's on. But we also have these bubbles of watching around, don't we?
Taliesin: Which would be you and I before the fight.
Sam: Or I can just drop the mansion.
Marisha: Well, the mansion could be good if things go terribly wrong.
Liam: That's true. If the mansion door is open and hidden behind that outcropping of rock there, you leave the door open but behind it, Keyleth could take to the sky, I could find somewhere low and be hidden. I can dart inside. I can be inside in a second.
Sam: And at the very least, Kima can be waiting inside the mansion, as can our lesser stealthy friend Pike. At least keep them in there.
Laura: Yeah. Sounds great.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: It's a plan.
Sam: It's something.
Taliesin: It's a plan! Anything more complicated would immediately fall apart when anything shifts, which will inevitably happen.
Laura: Actually, can I do Primeval Awareness and search for dragons to see if Vorugal's even in the area at all?
Matt: Sure. As you concentrate, you get a very strong nearby presence.
Marisha: She came in the mansion with us?
Taliesin: No.
Sam: There is no mansion yet. I haven't done it yet.
Marisha: Oh, you haven't done it yet. Never mind.
Matt: And you sense a closing dragon presence. At which point, you hear in the distance (wingbeats).
Taliesin: Mansion.
Laura: Mansion. Right now.
Sam: All right, I will cast the mansion behind a rock.
Laura: And run into it.
Taliesin: We will see you in the morning.
Matt: To?
Travis: Larkin.
Matt: To Larkin? All right. He goes, "Right."
Taliesin: Thank you. Truly.
Laura: Seriously, get in the mansion! Right now.
Matt: You glance off the side, and you can see Larkin looking off into the distance, and the white dragon Vorugal is curling in the air, currently wrestling with something, and then shoots down back into the ravine to the lair.
Marisha: Can I get like a glimpse of it before I run in on what it is? 27.
Matt: 27?
Sam: It's Yenk. (laughter)
Marisha: Damn it!
Matt: What brief view you have, it appears to be, by its size comparison, small-looking, but glancing at it, it looks to be some sort of a dire bear or dire wolf. Some sort of large furred entity that is currently being torn apart mid-air.
Marisha: So it went hunting.
Matt: Apparently. May have been hungry.
Liam: Snack.
Matt: You guys make your way into the mansion for a bit of a respite. Kima carries out the end of it, steps inside. "I don't trust that dwarf."
Taliesin: Excellent. That's why you're here. That's why he's not in here.
Laura: He can't know that you know.
Matt: "Good to know."
Sam: Kima, if it would help, I can erase your memory of this whole thing--
Matt: "You finish that sentence, and I will destroy you where you stand, Scanlan Shorthalt."
Sam: I'll let it alone for now.
Marisha: Good idea.
Matt: "Come near me--"
Taliesin: We wake up early. Before the sun rises, those of us who have to hide, hide. Once we see them bringing him to the summoning circle, we call the beast and we wait. We are going to be in the most danger, because we're going to be right in the thick of it.
Laura: What if he sees you, Percy? I'm better at hiding myself.
Taliesin: We're both going to be hiding in an ice-covered cubby-hole.
Laura: A lot of white.
Taliesin: It's not possible to get to those cubby-holes without a difficult climb, is it?
Laura: I could always bring you up on the broom.
Matt: If you get dropped off by broom, it's easy. Where is the mansion door, again?
Sam: Behind the bigger rock where Percy's stationed right now.
Liam: Yeah, we should wake up before sunlight.
Matt: Guess we'll say, as you guys all vanish from there, the entrance is right there, to the mansion.
Marisha: Who's going to keep an eye on Larkin?
Taliesin: I think it's hilarious that we can think we can.
Sam: Larkin can take care of--
Liam: Also, we've no fucking idea where Raishan is or what she's going to do, if anything.
Taliesin: We know that the one place she isn't is in here.
Laura: Larkin is Raishan. Really?
Travis: Holy shit. I even got that. (laughter)
Laura: You're the last one to realize that?
Travis: You're the last person in this room and on the internet.
Laura: No!
Liam: It's me. I'm the last one. I had no idea.
Sam: Hey, it took me five minutes.
Taliesin: Wow! Oh my god, we're going to die.
Marisha: I knew the second she walked up!
Sam: Ashley figured it out before us.
Ashley: No, she told me.
Matt: As you guys rest to prepare for your next day's excursion, we're going to take a restroom break here.
Liam: It's half of us, Laura! Jeez!
Matt: We'll see you guys back here in a few minutes. [break]
Matt: Welcome back. So! After that brief break, you guys have taken your time in the evening to rest up and get your spells back. Prepared for the coming confrontation, your now one-day delayed confrontation with Vorugal. As your evening comes to a close, the next morning is now before you--
Marisha: Hang on, we weren't done. We weren't done. We have to do things.
Laura: Yeah. One last thing.
Marisha: We have to eat. We have to do the Heroes' Feast, for sure.
Sam: Who's going to do it?
Ashley: I am.
Matt: All right. Pike drops down a Heroes' Feast. 1,000 gold out of your queue.
Laura: That's okay!
Marisha: Worth it, man.
Taliesin: Worth it, man.
Matt: All of you enjoy your first non-chicken related meal within Scanlan's mansion.
Laura: Feels good.
Matt: First in a while, at least. So as part of the Heroes' Feast, guys, if you recall the details of that circumstance.
Sam: Immune to fear.
Matt: Immune to fear, definitely.
Marisha: Saves on wisdom throws.
Matt: Wisdom saving throws have advantage.
Marisha: Also plus 2d10.
Matt: 2d10 to your maximum hit points.
Marisha: And I think that's it.
Matt: And you're immune to diseases. Immune to poison.
Laura: (gasps) You're immune to poison on this?!
Marisha: That's right. Fuck you Raishan.
Sam: Advantage on wisdom saves. Immune to poison.
Matt: All right, so marking hit points. Let me know what your maximum hit point totals increases are, currently.
Sam: Increased 14 points.
Matt: 14 points to Scanlan's maximum hit points.
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: 17 to Percy.
Marisha: An additional 11 to Keyleth.
Matt: 11 to Keyleth.
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15 to Vax.
Laura: I got two tens! I got an additional 20!
Marisha: You got two tens?!
Matt: Pike?
Ashley: I got nine, so that brings me to 97.
Matt: Awesome.
Travis: I got 11.
Matt: 11 to Grog, and then to Kima  eight. Write that down right there.
Marisha: And are we sure we don't want eyes on her? I'm not concerned about her well-being, clearly. I'm concerned on whatever her name she's saying she is right now.
Taliesin: My theory on that subject is that she's clever enough that eyes on her would not be helpful in the first place. It's best to assume that even if we could see her that she would be tricking us over what she's doing.
Sam: Okay and if she starts killing us, what do we do? Hide in the mansion? Regroup?
Taliesin: Hide in the mansion and worst-case scenario, scream that she betrayed us and that she promised that she would help kill the white dragon and see if they'll fight it out.
Liam: Worst-case scenario, we'll pull back towards the mansion if she starts whaling on us.
Taliesin: Yes. And definitely inspire some conflict.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Let's go fight.
Laura: Now we sleep.
Sam: Oh, sleep.
Matt: Your evening meal complete, you all find yourself back to full rest, preparing yourselves for tomorrow's grand showdown.
Taliesin: I'm at negative one.
Matt: You're now negative one to all of your rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Taliesin: Not to damage, though.
Matt: No. Just your d20 rolls.
Liam: You can get all 19s.
Laura: As I am going to sleep, I want to inscribe "sinaeth" on Fenthras.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What?
Matt: You don't know. Evening's rest complete, spells chosen for those who need to choose spells. Prepare yourselves for this confrontation. The morning comes. That early tension of imminent chaos fills the air. Conversation is short. What preparations do you wish to make this morning?
Taliesin: Vex is going to put me in that pocket.
Laura: Yes. I can't cast Pass Without a Trace on him from that far away.
Taliesin: We have Dust of Tracelessness.
Laura: Yes, but that's only tracks. While we're over there, before I go over to my side, I'm going to try to cover his area with Natural Explorer and try to hide him.
Taliesin: We're going to fly over there, as well. And then also we're attaching a rope, just in case.
Matt: Attaching a rope to?
Taliesin: To the wall, so I have something to climb down with if I need to. It's not going to be hanging out; it's all in.
Matt: Okay, the stone is like a smooth wall that comes out and then upward for the protective point.
Laura: I have climbing gear. You can use it as a grappling hook, maybe. Does that work at all?
Matt: You can fashion something. Make an intelligence check.
Laura: Ten.
Taliesin: Six.
Matt: It seems like it'll hold? You have a metal piece wedged into a part of the stone that seems pretty taut with the rope attached.
Marisha: Can I ask a logistical question? How wide and alive are those trees?
Matt: They are maybe a foot wide each, and currently, it looks like a lot of them are dying or dead from the perpetual snowfall and coverage that they are unused to.
Marisha: So Tree Stride probably wouldn't work on these guys. I'm wondering if I should waste my time.
Matt: Tree Stride. Same size as you. Some of them, maybe.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: Am I making us all Ravenites, or does that not even matter anymore?
Laura: I don't think that matters.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Have we left? Are me and Percy outside already?
Matt: You guys have gone outside if you're going to place him up in his perch there and help cover the area.
Liam: You have to do it, right? Because you're the one releasing this thing.
Sam: I guess if I'm going to be out in the open, I probably should.
Liam: And if you're doing it, does it take any more mojo to do it to all of us or just yourself? It can't hurt to do it to all of us.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: Make us all white Ravenites.
Sam: You mean wearing white clothes?
Laura: Sorry, I meant so we blend into the ice, not so that we're white. That sounded so terrible. I meant so that we're the same color as the ice and we're camouflaged! Like chameleons.
Taliesin: Are there actually enough albino Ravenites that we would stick out, or is that a common color?
Matt: You haven't really encountered any.
Taliesin: Oh, then I would recommend not. I would recommend white clothing.
Matt: You've seen varying shades of chromatic and metallic.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: Snow camouflage.
Taliesin: Snowy.
Matt: Okay. What are you doing?
Sam: I guess I'll make us all white Ravenites. Normal Ravenites with lighter-colored clothing that can maybe blend in. But also we can't dance very well and we clap on the two and the four. So yes, I'll make us all Ravenites.
Matt: Okay. So does that include Kima?
Sam: I can do eight people, so that's everyone, including Kima.
Matt: All right, so you are all currently for the purposes of this visually Ravenites of varying sizes and bulkiness. Okay, is everyone currently out and about right now? Outside of the house?
Sam: I'm going out.
Laura: Who all is leaving?
Sam: Oh wait, before I leave, doesn't someone have to buff me up for this spell?
Marisha: I do. Yep, I do. I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on your charisma.
Laura: How long does that last?
Marisha: An hour. So if we're ready to go?
Sam: Yeah, what time is it? Is it dawn?
Matt: You're not entirely certain. Make a survival check.
Laura: 18.
Sam: Eight.
Matt: You have no idea, Scanlan. It's about noon, from where you gather where the sun would be around that time based on what bits of shadows you can see. However, the sleet storm is starting to kick in, and you can see now the sheets of really cold rain with a slush to them are beginning to pound across the bottom of the ravine. The wind is picking up a bit, and the temperature is dropping significantly.
Laura: Bundle!
Marisha: Yep.
Sam: Okay. How will we know when it's time for me to release? We have to wait for Tooma to go report.
Laura: Is Vorugal back? He's back.
Sam: I assume.
Laura: Do we see Larkin around?
Matt: No, you do not see Larkin around.
Sam: Vax, do you want to go look?
Liam: For Larkin?
Sam: No, fuck Larkin. To see when Tooma's coming. I don't want to release this thing before Tooma is there reporting to Vorugal.
Laura: Well, maybe if we cause enough of a ruckus as soon as we release him.
Liam: I mean if we trust Tooma to hold up her part of the bargain, that dragon is coming here.
Laura: We need to make a lot of noise and then release it. Attract attention, release it, hide.
Sam: But when?
Laura: Whenever we want to.
Sam: No, when is Vorugal coming? We can't sit out here all day waiting.
Laura: Vorugal will come when we make a noise. He'll come over here.
Sam: The Ravenites have to tell him to come here first.
Laura: No, she told him that it's coming, I don't think she's telling him a specific time.
Sam: No, she's telling him now. Today. We told her to wait.
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, Vax and Keyleth, you guys notice down off the southern edge of the ravine, you see three humanoid figures walking up to your direction, coasting along the side of the mountain range.
Marisha: Do they appear to be Ravenites?
Matt: After a short time inspecting them, they appear to be Ravenite in structure, yeah. They are dragonborn, they are heavily robed, and they are coasting up along the side.
Marisha: Vex, you want to talk to them? They might have told him. Might have been the ones that just told him.
Laura: I walk over.
Matt: As you acknowledge them and begin to approach, one of them breaks from the two and they stay back. As it approaches you can see the tall burly dragonborn form, this is Skork. You met when you first came to the ruins of Draconia. He approaches. "Tooma sends me. When are we to tell the dragon the hunt is on?"
Marisha: We're ready whenever you are.
Laura: Give us 30 minutes. And then do it.
Matt: "30 minutes. It will be done." He returns to the other two, and they begin to make their way rather briskly back towards the direction of Vorugal's lair.
Taliesin: When you see the dragon pop up into the sky and head this direction, start summoning.
Laura: Percy? Up?
Taliesin: Yes, please.
Laura: All right. I take Percy up top.
Matt: You bring Percy up onto the top. The rain is starting to come down hard now and you're instinctively getting chills and shivering a little bit. You get up into your little parapet area, place him there.
Laura: I try to move some snow around and try to block it.
Matt: Percy, I need you to make a stealth check. Just in general.
Sam: Who, me?
Matt: No, just Percy.
Taliesin: That's 16.
Matt: 16. Good to know. Okay. So you place him up there. What else are you guys doing? You have 30 minutes, 25 now.
Liam: I'm going to hide behind the stone that's in the bottom end of the screen I'm looking at. Nope, opposite side. Nope, opposite wall. Sorry. Behind it.
Sam: Oops, Percy died.
Laura: Don't say that again!
Liam: And I think I already said it, but the Deathwalker's Ward is set to cold.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Does anyone want to be invisible for an hour?
Travis: Are we not going to be in the house?
Sam: Some of us will be. Do you want to wait in the house, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, I'll be in the house.
Sam: And Pike, too?
Ashley: Yeah, I'm going to stay in the house for a little bit.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to cast it and probably go into the house.
Matt: So Pike is staying up in the house?
Taliesin: I would not object to invisibility.
Laura: Yeah, can you make us invisible?
Sam: I can make a couple of you invisible. Keyleth, do you want to make anybody invisible?
Marisha: I can't do that. You keep forgetting that's you who can do that.
Sam: You can't do that?
Marisha: No.
Sam: You know what? I can't do it, anyway. I think Gate is a concentration spell. Even if I'm reading it off a scroll?
Marisha: No, it takes an action to cast.
Sam: It is a concentration spell.
Matt: It is, and as part of the casting of it, it would drop concentration.
Sam: Okay. Then I can't make anyone invisible.
Laura: Can I fly up and see if I can see Percy before I head over to my side?
Matt: You glide up into the air. Make a stealth check.
Laura: I don't want to go too high! 17.
Matt: Okay. You coast up. Make a perception check.
Laura: 32.
Matt: Against the white snow and the ice, the parapet structure itself is slightly off-color to the rest of the ice, and you do see the gleaming of Percy's cloak through the cover you've placed.
Laura: Shit. I dive back down and try to cover him a little bit more before I head over to my side.
Matt: Okay, that'll be the rest of this 30-minute preparation for you to do that. All right, who else is doing what now?
Marisha: I think I just peed a little.
Matt: Keyleth is peeing a little.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on myself as soon as I get to the other side so I can stay stealthed on my side.
Matt: Where are you staying, then?
Laura: On the other ledge. Yeah. I'm trying to hide myself.
Matt: Okay, roll a stealth check. And Trinket is staying in your necklace?
Laura: Yes! 32.
Matt: 32, good to know. All right. Pike, what are you doing? You're staying inside the mansion right now?
Ashley: I'm staying inside the mansion for right now.
Matt: Okay. Any other spells or casting preparation? Consider what spells you have that are not concentration that help defend. This is the time to do it.
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and wait until the 15-minute mark-- no, I'm going to wait until the ten-minute mark and then Enhance Ability on Scanlan.
Matt: Okay, got you.
Travis: If you pour poison on a blade, do you get poison damage if you hit them with it?
Matt: If there is a blade you can apply poison to, then yes, you would probably do a little bit of poison damage.
Laura: You know what, I want to pop Trinket out. I want him to be in the mansion with Pike and Grog. Go!
Matt: Grog, you're in the mansion, as well? All righty. Kima is like (anticipation noise).
Laura: Hide, Kima! Oh, she doesn't have an earring.
Matt: Nope. She joins you guys in the mansion for now. And Vax, you're hiding over behind that rock? Roll stealth, if you could.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Okay. You grasp onto the rock, and much like the elven cloaks in Lord of the Rings, you blend in with the stonework.
Liam: I'm going to go meditate on disguised dwarves. Goodbye.
Matt: Grog, any preparation you're doing for this? All righty. As time begins to tick down, 15 minutes left, ten minutes left--
Marisha: I cast Enhance Ability on Scanlan.
Matt: Okay, you're enhancing his?
Marisha: Charisma.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: And then I am going to move. We don't have anyone over here yet, really, correct?
Matt: No. You have Percy up here but no one down there.
Marisha: All right, I'm going to-- fuck.
Matt: Going to?
Marisha: Hide behind the tree and stealth as much as I can.
Matt: Okay, roll a stealth check.
Laura: Keyleth, shouldn't you hide in the mansion?
Sam: Can you become an animal?
Laura: Shouldn't you hide right now? Just be out of the way until Vorugal--
Marisha: I can be an animal if you feel like you want eyes out here, as well, but I won't be able to go elemental.
Taliesin: Then no.
Sam: Ever?
Marisha: Until I rest.
Laura: We've got eyes on. We're above. Just go hide.
Marisha: All right, I go in the mansion.
Matt: Okay, Keyleth makes her way back into the mansion. All right. Five minutes. Four minutes. Three minutes. Two minutes.
Sam: I will inspire myself.
Matt: Okay, that's part of your ability.
Sam: Yes, I will say to myself  all right, Scanlan. I know that your palms are sweaty. Your knees are weak, arms heavy. There's cologne on your tunic, Grog's spaghetti. But just remember. You're good enough. You're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.
Travis: Did you merge 8 Mile with--
Liam: With Stuart Smalley.
Matt: All right, so. As you step forward, where do you want to open the Gate scroll?
Sam: I'm still going to hang out by the rocks, and I can go at least 60 feet in front of me, but I'll do 50 feet.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: In the center, basically.
Matt: About there?
Sam: Yeah, sure.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Remember to be super direct with his name.
Sam: And his name is Yenk?
Marisha: Here, let me give you the script.
Matt: As you pull the scroll out, fumbling in your fingers slightly, you're slightly sweaty and nervous.
Sam: I'm not going to read it until I hear wings flapping.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: It takes six seconds to do, right?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh boy. That's an eight.
Marisha: You have advantage on charisma checks.
Matt: This is not charisma. This is his perception.
Laura: Do we see him in the sky at all?
Matt: You make a perception check. Don't hear any wings. You're listening; the wind's (whistles), the sound of the rain hitting the ground.
Laura: 19.
Matt: You begin to hear the flapping of wings in the distance and you glance over.
Laura: Scanlan! What are you doing? Cast it!
Sam: Okay, I'm casting.
Matt: Okay, as you pull the scroll out and begin reading it, the sigils and arcane glyphs are ancient and convoluted, and you're trying to trace them with your eyes and you begin speaking, letting the ancient knowledge that you've gained through your existence of wandering Exandria begin to pour out on its own. You feel the magic take hold and your grip tightens as the script begins to light up with a slight bluish-purple tint. As it begins to light up around, I need you to check to see if you succeed in reading to scroll.
Sam: Okay. So I roll with advantage?
Matt: You roll with advantage. Highest of two.
Sam: (gasps) Not great. Okay. And what am I adding?
Matt: Your d12 to it. So roll a d12. And plus two.
Sam: Plus two?
Matt: Plus two because Jack of All Trades.
Sam: Plus my charisma?
Matt: Plus your charisma bonus, which is six.
Sam: 20.
Matt: Okay, the DC was 19. (yelling)
Marisha: Every little bit helps.
Taliesin: Oh, we made the gumbo.
Matt: As some of the glyphs begin to shake and part of the scroll begins to burn at the edges, you maintain concentration, staring at it. The rain's hammering down on the scroll; it's growing slick and pouring off into the center of your sleeve. You're soaked to the bone now and shivering as you're reading out these various language bits that are flowing through. You're now an instrument for the spell that is beyond your capability, and as suddenly the spell finishes, your fingers tighten and the scroll bursts into flame and turns to dust around you. And for a split second, you think you may have failed. (spell noises) This giant bluish doorway erupts across the way.
Sam: Facing away from me.
Matt: Facing away from you. You see, all of you, that the somewhat dark and shadowed ravine is now suddenly aglow with bright vibrant bluish light. The blue light turns to crimson, to a deep burning red, and you hear this horrible, deep sucking sound. And you watch as Yenk the goristro is thrown from it, landing in the center of the ravine, fist to the ground--
Laura: We're going to die!
Ashley: We're going to die!
Matt: Are you leaving the gate open?
Sam: No, I close it instantly.
Matt: Okay, the gate slams shut behind, the reddish light then now being consumed with a final blip of blue before it disappears.
Sam: I'm going to tiptoe backwards into the mansion.
Matt: Well, the goristro swoops the head over in your direction. I need you to make a stealth check.
Sam: That's a seven.
Liam: Oh, Sam! (groans)
Travis: (whispers) Roll a little better.
Matt: You watch as the hulking behemoth, its extremely muscular body covered in fur and bony protrusions like spikes that jut out of its form, horrible hooked teeth and giant curled horns that push forward with brass jewelry emblazoned across the bone. Whips around, its red eyes beaming straight on you. In a deep, guttural voice, it (foreign words) and begins to just lumber in your direction.
Marisha: Oh god!
Matt: For right now, I need you, just for right now, Scanlan, roll initiative.
Laura: Oh my god.
Sam: 21! (cheering)
Matt: All right, you're going before it does. What are you doing?
Liam: Bamf to the door and go in!
Travis: Focus your chi.
Sam: I sing at it.
Laura: Oh my god.
Taliesin: No, he's got a movement and an action.
Sam: I sing at it. I will sing  (singing) Yenk, you will be our friend, travel through the portal and back again. Your heart is true, you're a fiend and a confidant. Boom boom boom. (speaking) All right, so I will Dominate Monster, with the hand cone.
Matt: Right. All right. Puts you at a full DC of what?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21. That is a 13. Those who are watching, Yenk comes barreling, and then comes to a stop and stands there, looking down at this tiny gnome about 40 feet away and nods.
Sam: I say, you will stay here, and you will kill a white dragon.
Matt: You see steam shoot out from the nose as now you notice the sound of the wings. (whooshing)
Sam: And I will tiptoe back into the mansion.
Marisha: That was the coolest thing you've ever done!
Matt: At which point--
Taliesin: No! (yelling)
Sam: It's huge!
Laura: Oh no, he's so big!
Travis: Holy shit.
Liam: Make all the action figure sounds, Matt!
Ashley: That's a biggie.
Matt: At this point in time, Vorugal lands. (snorting) And unleashes a torrent of frozen ice in this direction.
Marisha: I've been waiting for this all week!
Laura: I hope we can take it and it actually does damage.
Matt: That is going to be--
Marisha: Just dies instantly. Oh fuck. Apparently white dragons are its weakness.
Laura: I know!
Sam: We're in a lobby, eating chicken.
Travis: A little elevator music playing.
Matt: As the blast hits, you can see coats of ice across the floor. So you guys are aware, the ice and sleet and everything here is making the entire terrain rough terrain. So everyone is at half speed on foot in this entire battlefield. You can see the actual air around Vorugal itself is crystallizing into thick mist that surrounds his form sightly. Yenk is blasted with all this frozen frost-breath, and you can see the icicles crystallizing against his form. (roars) Goes running forward, and slams, goring with its horns into Vorugal's chest.
Laura: This feels like more like playtime than anything. All the action figures: bam bam bam!
Matt: Watch me play with my toys, guys! All right, you watch as the horns slam into Vorugal's chest, not really expecting the ferocity and the sheer force of this entity it's unfamiliar with. The horns spark with flames, strangely. It also tears this giant gash in two points across Vorugal's chest. You can see white scales fly from the impact. And also, okay. It is not pushed. Vorugal stands its ground as Yenk pulls back. You see dark purple blood from the edge of the horns of the goristro. End of his turn. All right, does not save against the Dominate Monster.
Sam: Yeah, that means he's still dominated. Okay.
Taliesin: He has not realized this is possibly a poor idea.
Travis: Yenk's going to go, "Come on, chum. Let's be friends."
Matt: It did take damage from the ice breath, so it would have been trying to make its save. Did not make it. At the end of Yenk's turn, Vorugal is going to use two of its legendary actions to do a wing attack. With a three, Yenk is knocked prone, and he suffers 15 points of bludgeoning damage. At which point, Vorugal's moving. Takes up into the air, right above. Now coming to Vorugal's turn. Vorugal gets cold breath back. And while Yenk is on the ground, looking upward and trying to get back up from the slick snow, releases another blast of cold breath down onto Yenk once more. Constitution save, plus 14. Does make its save again. It's a hardy individual; constitution saves are high. It causes this cluster of ice to gather around his form, and he breaks free. Vorugal is then also going to use its flight to move over this way and spin around.
Liam: Natural 20 on my stealth.
Matt: Yenk is going to use its turn to stand up. It looks around. It does make its save, breaking Dominate Monster, so that is gone.
Sam: Okay. Would I feel that? No, I'm on another plane of existence.
Matt: You're on another plane of existence. You guys are all in this quiet space, fingers crossed, hoping right now. Yenk looks frustrated at this point in time. Not a whole lot I can do right now at the moment, so it's going to run beneath and attempt to leap to grab it. Unfortunately, it does not make the full height. Leaps up in the air with all its strength; its thick muscular, hoofed hind legs crouch down and leaps in the air, its giant claws reaching forth, but Vorugal keeps just out of reach and kicks out with its claws and tail, knocking it back onto the ground. It lands, no effect. Vorugal's turn now. Actually, at the end of Yenk's turn-- no, it's not close enough. Come back to Vorugal's turn. Vorugal does not get the ice breath back. It's going to swoop down, eager to finish this hunt, and is going to unleash a series of attacks. Yeah, this is an interesting dynamic right now, because it looks like Yenk is resisting a lot of the cold impact from this. Vorugal's going to do a full range of attacks. Hits with the bite, hits with the claw, hits with the tail. Lands and bites into him. You see ice shards go shooting off from the impact with the teeth. Both claws tear into the chest, but you can see the flesh itself is hardy and resistant to the dragon's attacks. It's damaging it, but Yenk is definitely made of sturdier stuff.
Laura: While this is going on  Percival.
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: If Yenk dies really fast, what do we do?
Taliesin: I'm going to signal them to come out.
Laura: Oh fuck.
Matt: Okay, it comes to Yenk's turn now. As you guys are having this conversation, he is going to make two of its fist attacks and one with its hoof.
Sam: Yes, Yenk! Yes!
Matt: A hit. A miss. And a hit.
Taliesin: He's expending power, as well.
Marisha: Yeah, he's burned two of his legendary actions already. Yeah, we're watching the dragon burn through his legendary actions.
Taliesin: That's the other thing.
Laura: Oh, that's great!
Matt: Legendary actions it gets every turn.
Laura: He hasn't burned through any resistances, though.
Matt: You watch as after the clawing goes through Yenk's chest, Yenk reaches up and grabs the edge of Vorugal's scaly back of its head and uppercuts right into the jaw, and then brings up one of its hooves and straight-up chest kicks with the sharpened hoof into the center of Vorugal's chest. It leaves Vorugal stumbling back for a second. At the end of that turn, it's going to use two of its legendary actions to once again beat its wings. Yenk, not being a very dexterous individual, fails and gets knocked prone once again, sending Vorugal once again up to there. Back to Vorugal's turn, he does not get the ice breath, but it looks like Vorugal actually is moving further and further away and is biding his time.
Sam: I'm going to cast Invisibility on myself and poke my head out the door. Yeah, that'll work.
Matt: Yeah, you look out. Make a perception check. The sleet is coming down pretty hard, so you're having to glean what you can.
Sam: Fucking eight.
Matt: You can see some movement of dragon stuff in the air, and you hear various pitches of growling, horrible, angry yelling in the center of the battlefield.
Marisha: So we know they're here.
Matt: You know they're there.
Sam: Battle is still going on. I'll check again in 12 seconds.
Matt: Yenk's turn, very frustrated, can't seem to figure out what to do, is going to attempt to leap once more. Nope. He runs, leaps, tries to grab at the foot. Vorugal steps out of the way. Yenk finishes landing on the opposite side; no effect. Turns around. All right. Vorugal. Gets the cold breath back. He is going to fly backwards, and as it does, sprays an unholy mess of frozen breath energy down towards Yenk, who does not make the save, but still takes resistant damage, thanks to cold resistance. You watch with each impact Yenk's open wounds are getting frost shards jammed into them. Right now, it looks like Yenk doesn't have much of a recourse until Vorugal is on the ground, and Vorugal seems to have noticed this and is starting to keep a distance, and is waiting.
Marisha: I can ground him.
Sam: And expose yourself?
Marisha: I'm just throwing it out there. I can ground him.
Matt: Back to Yenk's turn. At the end of Vorugal's turn, Vorugal is going to take up about ten more feet... to get completely out of his leaping range there.
Liam: How high is he?
Matt: Right now? 60 feet up. Yenk leaps and can't quite get that height and angrily begins to reach over and climb up the side of the mountain there.
Liam: Can I attack him right now?
Matt: What's up?
Liam: Can I attack him right now?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: Vorugal. 60 feet. I'm sharpshooter; he's 60 feet away from me.
Matt: 60 feet is your range. He's a little higher than 60 feet from the angle.
Sam: Are you on the ground?
Laura: He's on the ground.
Liam: Pop out the wings.
Matt: Or the wings, you could do that.
Liam: Fly within 40 feet of him. Throw Whisper at his ass. That's what I'm doing. Assassin.
Sam: Are you going to go up his ass into his stomach?
Laura: In the dragon again.
Sam: In the dragon!
Matt: All right. As you step over, the wings unleash and you fly up right underneath Vorugal right there.
Liam: Do I need to roll for stealth, though?
Matt: No, you're still stealthed. You were holding that, yeah. You don't seem to be noticed. Right now, Vorugal's attention is faced over as it's floating, staring at Yenk, who's now starting to climb up the side of the mountain.
Liam: So finally, this is advantage and an automatic critical hit? Assassin trait.
Matt: Well, let's see. I'd say, given the circumstances, it is unaware that you are part of the battlefield, even though there is a current threat in its circumstance, so in this situation-- let me double-check real fast.
Sam: It's not even a Dungeons and Dragons book.
Taliesin: It's a cookbook!
Sam: They're all people!
Sam: It's a cookbook!
Taliesin: It's a cookbook!
Matt: I would say, given the fact that it's completely unaware there was any other combatants in the vicinity aside from Yenk, I will allow this to be a surprise attack from you, though he is not considered surprised to anybody else. There isn't a surprise round.
Liam: All right. I rolled a 28.
Matt: Oh, that hits.
Liam: This is Whisper. I'm using Whisper. I'm going to cast Divine Smite on the attack, as well.
Matt: All right. Roll damage on that.
Ashley: Kill him. One turn.
Liam: Here we go. Two.
Laura: (laughing) Four!
Liam: Hold on. No, so all the dice first. Two plus the psychic damage, which is 1d8. Nine. Plus the Divine Smite, which is 15. Yeah, here comes the sneak attack damage. (counting) 38, plus my modifier which is 46. No, we double the dice first, so 38 times two. 76. Plus eight is 84.
Matt: 84 points of damage against Vorugal. Are you going with the blade, or you letting it sit?
Liam: Oh, I went with the blade.
Laura: So you're on Vorugal right now?
Matt: So as you throw the blade up, it strikes into one of the wounds that Yenk had already clawed under its chest, and the blade sinks up to the hilt and further in, and as you appear, you're actually wrist-deep in the wound right now.
Travis: Back in the dragon again!
Matt: You are right up with Vorugal right now.
Liam: I'm hasted. That's action number one. Action number two is to throw Whisper down toward the trees closest to you, DM, and bamf there, and use my bonus action to hide. I'll hit the ground, right?
Matt: The blade loses its luster and stumbles into the snow. (clinking) Hits the ground. It's out of range. It doesn't hit anything solid; you don't go with the blade.
Liam: I'm going to push off him, then.
Laura: You have wings.
Liam: Yeah, I know that. What did I use? I used 40 feet of movement?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay. I don't know how much I have left. If I'm hasted, I would have 120 total, but that's halved, so 20 feet, because you said rough terrain. But I'm in the air?
Matt: You're in the air, but there's a lot of sleet and rain hitting.
Liam: So ten feet. That's all right. I'm going to keep moving away. I'm going to use all my movement to get away from him and go away from his butt. I should have a bonus action that I can use. The rest of my movement, plus dash.
Matt: All right, before you get there, he's now (roars). The angry scream. Vorugal's head swoops around underneath and directly into your eyes as you dart away with the blade. He spins in place and bites at you as you're trying to pull away.
Liam: I have advantage on dexterity saving throws.
Matt: Okay. This is a bite attack, so it doesn't matter. So that is a 26?
Liam: That hits.
Matt: All right. So you take 22 points of piercing damage.
Liam: Okay. Can I Uncanny Dodge this? Is this melee?
Matt: Yeah, it's a melee attack, so you can do that. Plus 14 points of cold damage.
Liam: Which is halved because of my armor, so 26 down to 13 and seven. 20 total.
Matt: Yeah, 20 total, reduced by half because of Uncanny Dodge, you said?
Liam: Okay, so I'm down to 95.
Matt: Okay. So 95. You pull away to about there, the rest of your movement?
Liam: I want to use bonus action to dash. I don't know if that gets me 60 feet away flying.
Matt: Flying, so it would be 30.
Liam: It's 120 hasted, so 60 feet halved.
Matt: Okay, so yeah, you can get all the way to the ground if you want to.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: You get down to the ground about there if you want. Okay. Now I need you to go ahead and roll initiative and put you on the initiative order.
Liam: Yes, sir.
Matt: You have now engaged.
Liam: Okay, so it's an 11.
Matt: An 11.
Taliesin: Have you said anything in the earpiece yet?
Liam: Well, you guys saw it. People inside can't hear me.
Matt: All right, so comes back to the top of the round now. Yenk is currently climbing up the side. Gets about halfway up the side. Is not entirely up, but is clawing up, and you feel the impact from where you're standing, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm holding.
Matt: Going to use the rest of his action to climb up. Gets all the way to the top of the ravine, which is about at the same height that Vorugal is. Based on your help, I need you to roll another stealth check because you helped him for the last half hour. You have advantage because she was helping you.
Taliesin: Oh! 13. 13, because I'm at a negative one.
Laura: 13? That's worse than it was before!
Matt: Yenk gets to the top and turns around and sees Vorugal off to the side, glances down and goes (foreign words). And is going to make a giant bowling underhand fist punch right towards you, Percy.
Taliesin: I was holding ready. Can I try and beat his initiative and get a shot off first?
Matt: As a reaction right now, you can go ahead and take a shot.
Marisha: It's time to go.
Sam: Has it been two rounds?
Taliesin: Jenga!
Matt: It's been more than two rounds since this started.
Sam: How about since I looked last?
Matt: It's been almost a round.
Laura: Can I see all this happening?
Matt: You do watch this happening.
Laura: I'm going to take an arrow and shoot it. I can see the door, but it's not going to register on a magical door, is it?
Matt: No.
Laura: Fuck.
Marisha: We're about to pop out.
Liam: Hey, B-T-dubs, I've just learned that Whisper can only bamf me once per round, right?
Matt: It needs to solidly hit something.
Liam: To stick within 60 feet. Got it.
Matt: You can't throw it as hard as you can and it'll teleport you wherever it lands. It has to impact.
Taliesin: I'm going to press a torso push with this, by the way.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to press a torso push. Better! 33. I don't even know why I bother. He's automatically pushed ten feet away from me.
Matt: He does still get the one hit on you, which is 27.
Taliesin: Oh, that hits.
Matt: You take 23 points of bludgeoning damage from the fist, and then the fist seems to sparkle with electrical energy as it goes to impact you.
Taliesin: That's magic.
Matt: It is not a magic spell, no. You take six points of lightning damage.
Marisha: Yenk is on top?
Matt: Yenk is at the top of the ravine.
Marisha: Isn't Percy halfway down?
Matt: Yenk got up to where he would see him and then saw him as he was passing by. Stopped to slam him.
Taliesin: So 23 plus six. That's fine. The lightning damage, the cloak doesn't absorb that?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay. Then I'm going to do my damage on him, which is new to me. That's terrible. That's 11 points of damage, plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: 13 points of damage. Gets pushed back. Because he's still holding onto the edge, he has to see if he can-- No, it does not. Yenk loses grip from the blast of the gun after punching you, stumbles back. Claw hits the edge and falls down prone to the ground at the base of the ravine. 40 feet.
Taliesin: 50 feet.
Matt: 50 feet. Taking an additional 16 points of bludgeoning damage, which is halved.
Taliesin: Do I join the initiative order?
Matt: You do. Go ahead and roll initiative.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: 21. All right. That ends Yenk's turn. Vorugal does not get the ice breath back. However, does see both of you in the vicinity.
Laura: Me?
Matt: Does not see you, no, but it sees Vax and Percy.
Taliesin: It sees me? All right.
Matt: The blast of the gun and the impact and the whole encounter with Yenk exposed you. It's going to use its action to use Frightful Presence, so I need both Percy and Vax-- and Vex, actually, because you're still within the range-- to make a wisdom saving throw. You have advantage. You guys are immune to frightening, so it doesn't actually affect you regardless, so don't worry about it.
Liam: Don't roll?
Matt: Don't have to roll; you're immune to fear. Yenk makes his saving throw, so Yenk is not afraid, either.
Marisha: Thanks, Pike! Should we pop out? Should we do this?
Laura: No, not yet!
Sam: After 12 seconds, I will look. I will stick my head out and look again.
Matt: Vorugal is now watching the battlefield and seeing the people that have been revealed. Vorugal's going to go up a little higher.
Sam: He's a total not-a-good-hunter. I thought he enjoyed the hunt!
Matt: He doesn't enjoy being ambushed or in a fight that he can't win.
Sam: I've poked my head out to look.
Matt: Okay. You look out and you see Vorugal way high in the air. You see Yenk on the ground, and you see a couple of your companions less stealthed than they were before.
Marisha: What's it looking like, Scanlan?
Sam: I pop my head back in and I tell them  shit's going down. Should we go out or let this play out a bit? Yenk is not dead.
Taliesin: Jenga!
Laura: They can't hear you, Percy. I can hear you, but they can't.
Sam: Yenk is not dead, so we will be fighting Yenk, as well.
Ashley: We can't leave them out there alone.
Sam: I guess we go.
Ashley: Right? Are we going to leave them out there to die?
Marisha: I can try and ground him. It's a strength saving throw, though; it's going to be tough.
Laura: Try and ground Vorugal? Try it.
Marisha: I say, excuse me, Scanlan.
Matt: Those who are entering the fray, roll initiative.
Sam: I'm going to leave the mansion and start running.
Marisha: Son of a fuck!
Sam: 14.
Matt: 14. What did you get, Keyleth?
Marisha: Four.
Sam: That's top of the round!
Matt: Anyone else? Grog?
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15. All righty.
Liam: You get advantage, right?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Vex, do you want to roll?
Laura: I guess as soon as I see everybody run out, I would start attacking.
Matt: Pike, you as well?
Ashley: Five.
Sam: Yeah, this is great.
Travis: Wow. Fuck me.
Liam: Oh jeepers, we're going to die.
Sam: Don't worry, we've got our secret weapon. Our secret weapon, by the way, now wants to kill all of us.
Marisha: Did he lose his save against it?
Sam: He wants to kill us.
Taliesin: Except that he also has a dragon to contend with, so as long as we keep it a bigger threat than us, I think he'll keep his concentration where it is.
Marisha: We should still try to stay out of all this.
Matt: Everyone who has rolled initiative will be on the next initiative order. Vax, you're finishing up this round.
Liam: Oh, I am? I would like to throw Whisper to the rock I was initially hiding behind and bamf there.
Matt: Roll an attack roll.
Liam: Yeah. Sure, that's 25. I would like to use my bonus action to hide behind that rock.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Liam: That is a 25. Can I hold my last action?
Matt: You could hold an action to do one thing with a trigger, sure. You can use your hasted action.
Liam: I'm going to stay put. Stay hidden.
Matt: All right, that brings us to the top of the round. Percy, you're at the top.
Taliesin: Oh boy. Okay. I'm going to take a wing shot at that dragon to try and drop him. Come on. Natural 20.
Laura: (yelling) Yes!
Ashley: There it is.
Taliesin: Does the 1d6 also double? Is it all dice or just the standard damage?
Matt: No, the dice, as well.
Ashley: No mercy Percy!
Marisha: You're my favorite.
Taliesin: Oh, you say that now. Let's see how this goes. First the damage, which is not bad. 16 points of normal damage and 11 points of psychic damage, and he's prone.
Matt: What's the total on that one?
Taliesin: 16 and 11. That's 27.
Matt: All right. Well, it has to make a strength save.
Taliesin: No, not against the wing shot. Oh, strength saving throw; you're right. Against a DC of 19.
Matt: That is a success. 21.
Taliesin: Again. That'll hit. 31 to hit.
Matt: 31 will hit, yep.
Taliesin: Same thing. 15 points of damage plus one psychic, so 16.
Matt: 16, and what was the DC again?
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19? Just fails with an 18, so instead of being knocked prone it drops 60 feet per round.
Taliesin: So it's dropping now?
Matt: We'll say for now, yes, it's dropping.
Sam: Come on, Yenk. Kill that thing. (plastic platform clatters)
Sam: He died!
Taliesin: What should I make it have difficulty with? Not saving, but checks.
Sam: He's not going to have to check anything.
Taliesin: You never know.
Matt: There. All right, Percy. That was your second shot.
Taliesin: One more shot. First, I'm going to Hex the dragon. I'm going to give him disadvantage against strength checks. And I'm going to shoot him with a sharpshooter shot for my last shot. Come on. Yeah! 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Taliesin: This is good. (excited yell) 18. Oh my god, okay. 28 plus five psychic, so that's 33 points of damage, plus another d6. Plus another five necro.
Matt: Nice, 38. As you're aiming up as Vorugal's getting further and further away, you aim up and fire. One side hits it and wings it ever so slightly, the second shot you aim the other side it actually hits the joint and causes the wing to flap. Vorugal tumbles out of the air for a second and just manages to catch himself and the final shot impacts right in the back of the skull spines and shatters part of the bone and ice off of it, leaving a nice, fresh wound in the back of the head.
Taliesin: Now, I'm going to take cover in my little cove.
Liam: I'd like to think of you driving and cutting someone off on the 101 and going, "Plus five necro."
Taliesin: Plus five necro, motherfucker.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: He's checking the sheet. Oh no.
Laura: Oh no, what are you looking at?
Taliesin: It means there's a very angry dragon now that's looking at me.
Matt: Okay, so Kima, who's now eager to get out there goes, "Okay. All right. Let's do this." She's going to cast Aura of Vitality on herself as her action. Then she goes running through the center of the portal, leaps out, turns the corner to there and stops and goes, "Oh shit." That's her turn.
Marisha: That's her turn?
Matt: She's just entering the fray and did a preparation spell as part of that. Ending Kima's turn, let's see here. From out of seemingly nowhere in particular, you see a flash of electrical energy arcing from one of the nearby sections of the crevasse alcove. The bolt of energy arcs out and slams into Vorugal, who does not make the save, not seeing it there.
Taliesin: All right. We've got a game.
Sam: Five points of damage!
Marisha: What are you good for?
Matt: That'll be 41 points of lightning damage.
Sam: Okay!
Marisha: Remember, she learned from the druids a bunch of fucking nature shit.
Matt: One of the arcs tries to reach for Yenk and manages to disperse before it can get to it. It's not quite within range, but that finishes wherever that lightning source was. Yenk angrily is going to stand up and turn. It is going to attempt to run and grab up at Vorugal again.
Marisha: Come on, Yenk!
Sam: Come on, Yenk!
Matt: Leaps and misses, (impact) landing right next to the rock. That's a natural 20 on a perception check as it lands (impact) and looks over right into your face.
Liam: Hi.
Matt: Yenk is now aware of you.
Taliesin: He's just noticing everybody.
Matt: At the end of Yenk's turn-- that's not going to help him right now. That's going to end that. Vorugal's turn. Breath does return this time. Vorugal, from up here, is going to send ice breath across the entire ground, sweeping up across both Yenk and Vax. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Could I use Evasion for this?
Matt: No, it's constitution.
Liam: All right. I'm going to use Luck. First Luck of the day. All right, 13.
Matt: 13? No. You suffer 72 points of cold damage, halved because of your resistance.
Ashley: How much, again?
Matt: 72, but halved because of your cold resistance. 36 points of cold damage to you.
Travis: Um. What?
Matt: Vorugal's then going to take higher up into the air.
Taliesin: Can he do that already, even recovering from the prone?
Matt: Yeah. The idea with prone is that unless there's something that maintains or it can't improve its movement past its next turn, it continues to fall. That's going to finish Vorugal's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'm up?
Matt: Yep. You're still inside the mansion.
Sam: Do not draw attention to yourself, friend.
Travis: Fuck that. We're all going down. I take the Titanstone Knuckles and I smash them together, and I use the Enlarge, and I will burst out of the mansion in a rage.
Liam: Big Grog!
Matt: So that's 30 feet of movement. You have 20 more feet, if you want.
Travis: No, remember it's halved.
Matt: All right. Then there, that's 25. That's your movement. The gauntlets took your bonus action. You can still use your action to dash, if you want to move further. Or do you want to stay there and hold your action?
Liam: Wait. I'm sorry. Yenk knew where I was. Did the dragon know where I was, too?
Matt: It's funny. It hit Yenk and the whole thing, but the dragon has an aerial view, and you have a single rock that you went behind to hide, and it saw you move behind the rock. You have to break eye contact to stealth.
Travis: I'll use that dash to keep moving towards the ice wall, towards you. Maybe two or three squares. That will be my turn.
Matt: You can get there. Hulking, axe gripped, giant Grog is leaping through the snow. (impacts) You're two-thirds the size of Yenk, right now, which is crazy. All right, that ends Grog's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Me? I'm still invisible. I'm going to leave the mansion.
Matt: You're not still invisible, because you cast Dominate Monster.
Sam: No, I cast Invisibility after I cast Dominate Monster. I'm going to leave the mansion and clockwise around the game board.
Matt: That's as far as you can get, there, with your reduced movement.
Sam: If I inspire, that kills my invisibility?
Matt: Technically, no. It's not an attack or an action, so I would say it wouldn't. It may give away your location.
Sam: Then I will use my bonus action to keep moving. To dash?
Matt: To dash is your action. You can do that, yeah. Your bonus action, that's only a rogue ability.
Sam: I will dash and keep moving away and that way.
Matt: This way? Okay. That's your action.
Sam: That's it?
Matt: Yeah. It's big, heavy snow and slick ice. You're having to be careful.
Sam: Okay. I don't want to draw attention to myself, so that'll be that.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: I'm only within range of Kima. I'm not going to give away my position to inspire her.
Matt: All right, finishing your turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Holy shit. Yeah, I'm going to take to the air. Holy shit. I'm going to fly within 60 feet of Vorugal. 55 feet away.
Matt: That will put you about there. Okay. Yenk has a reach of ten because his arms are long, and you're within his combat range, so as soon as you fly up, he swings out with his fist to attempt to impact you.
Liam: All right, Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: As you're with your wings, dagger out, this fist comes swinging like a battering ram from the side. That is 22 to hit. Misses. (whoosh) You just barely dodge out of the way. You feel the force of it, the wind batter a bunch of errant falling sleet and snow across your face, but you rush past, the hasted bonus saving you on that one.
Liam: Okay, so how far did I just go?
Matt: That would have been 55 feet.
Liam: 55 feet. I can go 120 in one action, so that's my movement.
Matt: Halved, yeah.
Liam: Halved, but 120, so that's my movement, total. I'm going to throw Whisper in his face. I'm not going to bamf there; I'm just going to throw the dagger.
Matt: Into Vorugal?
Liam: Vorugal's face. That's halfsies, so I'm going to roll it again. That's way better. That is a 32.
Matt: That hits. How many Luck have you used, by the way?
Liam: One. That is 12 plus the psychic damage.
Matt: I thought you used Luck once before, today.
Liam: I don't think so. Not since waking up.
Matt: It would have been yesterday. You're right.
Liam: 12, plus two is 14, and I'm going to cast Divine Smite-- no, I'm not. No, just 14 of damage, so that's movement, action. My next action I'm going to use to fly under him, halfway between Percival and the gang, and land on the wall.
Matt: Land on the wall this way?
Liam: Yeah. Now, that wall is higher up than it looks, so I'm really flying straight, right?
Matt: Correct. We'll say you're about there, technically.
Liam: Yes, and then for a bonus action, my last spell slot, I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on my fucking self for a plus two to AC.
Matt: There you go. Ending Vax's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Yikes. Well. Are we outside the mansion?
Matt: No, you're inside the mansion right now. You just watched Grog, Kima, and Scanlan all dart out of it. Well, you didn't see Scanlan leave. Scanlan vanished.
Ashley: Scanlan vanished.
Matt: It's you, Trinket, and Keyleth.
Laura: Did I ever get on the initiative order?
Matt: What did you roll? Ten, right? You'd technically be after Vax. We'll do your turn after this, but you're after Vax.
Ashley: I'm going to pop out. Maybe I can stay in there and do this, in the door, and try to cast Divine Intervention.
Matt: Divine Intervention? All right, so you step out and you see this chaos happen: the dragon in the air, the fiend on the side, swinging and barely missing a flying Vax, who swoops past in the middle of this sleet storm. You close your eyes and concentrate, holding your holy symbol, praying that Sarenrae has the ability to reach beyond the Divine Gate and lend you her strength temporarily. I need you to roll a d10.
Marisha: Man, how awesome would this be?
Laura: It would be insane.
Matt: What did you roll?
Ashley: A ten?
Matt: A zero?
Laura: Yeah, a zero.
Marisha: (excited gasping) Shut the fuck up! She has to roll under her level, which she did.
Matt: So this succeeded.
Marisha: Shut the fuck up, Ashley!
Matt: So as you clutch your holy symbol, concentrating, hoping that she's there, feeling the division between the gods and their followers since the Divergence occurred. You've reached out to her a number of times. You look up through the darkness of your closed eyes, and you see a light, a beacon open. The clouds part, and suddenly the sound of rain goes away. The sound of all the chaos goes away, and it's just warmth and quiet, and you watch as Sarenrae's hand comes down and touches your forehead, and with your closed eyes, and says, "I'll do what I can." As she drifts away and smiles, you watch as her hand turns into a fist, and she looks up and disappears into the light. As you open your eyes, you now see up in the sky above Vorugal, the clouds that are dark, a sparkle of divine energy begins to swirl. As it grows stronger and stronger, the clouds suddenly part, and a giant column of divine energy (boom) slams down, right on top of Vorugal. Vorugal looks up just in time to try to move out of the way before it slams him back. Does not make his dex save with a roll of five. Vorugal suffers 50 points of divine damage and is slammed onto the ground. (cheering)
Taliesin: Stay down!
Marisha: Yes! Holy fuck! Pike! That was amazing!
Ashley: Oh boy!
Liam: Action figure is down.
Matt: Additional 26 points of bludgeoning damage. As the light column slams Vorugal to the ground, you can see some of the ice and snow underneath melts immediately, and what was once a column, you can see now looks like a giant fist made of spiritual energy that then withdraws slowly off the back of Vorugal and then dissipates before the clouds close up once more.
Ashley: Yes! It worked!
Matt: That's your movement and your action.
Ashley: For a bonus action, I would like to place a spiritual weapon at the back of his neck, since he's on the ground. And I would like it to be a very large flaming sword.
Matt: Okay. You watch as the hand of Sarenrae dissipates, some of the energy that's residual there lingers, and then forms into a flaming sword of pure golden-white energy. It is now hovering over the currently slammed-down, broken-looking body of Vorugal.
Sam: She's the best one of the group! (laughter)
Matt: All righty. That was... What level spell was that, again, Pike? Second level. Got it. All right, so make a melee spell attack against Vorugal. Roll a d20 and add, I believe it's 11. Roll a d20 and add 11 to it as the flaming blade attempts to strike down towards Vorugal.
Ashley: 25.
Matt: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Okay, well, six. Sarenrae did the damage.
Matt: Six points of divine damage.
Ashley: Sarenrae does 50 points of damage, and I do six.
Matt: Through you, did 50 points. You're still part of it. All right, that ends Pike's turn. Vex, we're taking your turn because you weren't in the initiative order.
Laura: That's okay. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on Vorugal.
Matt: Because dragons are your chosen enemy, I'm giving you the plus two damage against it.
Laura: Okay, so I'm hidden, technically, so I get sneak attack on him, right?
Matt: Currently, you have not been noticed.
Laura: Okay, so I'm going to hit him, or try to. That is 34.
Matt: Yeah, that'll hit. Divine Intervention, man. Finally worked. Can't use it for a week, by the way, Pike, just so you're aware. Once it succeeds, you can't use it for a week.
Ashley: That's fine. (laughter)
Ashley: I doubt it's going to work again. That, I think, has never worked.
Marisha: You've gotten close. You've gotten really close.
Travis: Three years, never worked.
Laura: 30 points of damage on the first hit, and two of those are lightning.
Matt: Great.
Taliesin: Is it gargantuan? Gargantuan. Trust Travis on this one.
Laura: 22 on the second, two of which are lightning.
Matt: Okay. Nice. All right, that ends your turn. You used your bonus action to Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I did. I'm going to hang out there and duck down, if I can, behind my little outcropping.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Oh god. I'm going to pop out of the mansion. I was expecting to do an Earthbind spell, but that's not necessary. That's okay!
Matt: Pike, do you want to move at all, or do you want to stay behind that rock?
Ashley: I'm going to stay behind.
Marisha: I'm going to fuck this guy up while he's down. I'm going to peek around the corner, going towards you a bit, and seeing everyone there and all this go down, I'm going to Fire Storm the fuck out of this!
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Death from above.
Marisha: Fire rains from above!
Taliesin: Fire rains from above!
Matt: How are you organizing the Fire Storm?
Marisha: I have ten of these? I'm shaking.
Matt: Fire Storm, you create ten ten-foot cubes. You can maneuver it to hit both him and Yenk, if you want to.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I want.
Matt: Make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Get that epic loot drop.
Marisha: I know. I want it.
Matt: That is a failure on Vorugal, with a ten, and a seven on Yenk. They both fail, so roll damage on that. 7d10 fire damage.
Marisha: 7d10.
Laura: Hey, Matt.
Matt: Yes?
Ashley: 1d8 plus your spellcasting modifier?
Matt: Which is five. It's your wisdom.
Ashley: Spell attack bonus.
Matt: Yes, there's a difference.
Ashley: I understand.
Laura: Do it, Keyleth!
Taliesin: Want a bonus?
Laura: It doesn't count on the floor.
Marisha: I'll roll this one. It's eight! Okay, hang on. (counting) 30. I picked it up. 38.
Matt: 38 fire damage to both of them. All righty. The Fire Storm tears through the ravine. You can see the flames burn over Vorugal's body. Vorugal is now trying to get back up. (roars) He's extremely angry. The flames curl over Yenk, who bats away at them. It burns him, but Yenk does seem to resist it fairly well.
Marisha: I'm going to use the last bit of my movement to pop back behind the stone.
Matt: Okay. There you go. All righty, does that end your turn? Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to take aim and hold my full attack until he tries to get up.
Matt: Okay. That brings us to Kima's turn. Kima sees the opportunity. Because of the snow, she can't quite get there yet with her full movement, unfortunately. All righty. Kima is going to use the rest of her action to dash and get right up next to Vorugal and is going to use her bonus action to use Vow of Enmity against it. She goes, "You are going to see Bahamut in pieces!" As she brings the thumb across, the holy symbol glows for a second. You see a mark emblazon and burn itself into the side of Vorugal's body. That's going to end Kima's turn.
Taliesin: That's a sick tattoo, y'all.
Laura: Maybe it's like Hex and Hunter's Mark.
Travis: We don't know what that does.
Matt: What's the range on that, actually? That's going to be a rough call. Okay, you watch as emerging from the treeline here, you see a little dwarf step forward, unaffected by the ice, and reach out a hand as a cluster of necrotic energy sparkles in the center. Leaps forward toward Vorugal. That is a success on the save, so it's half damage, but Keyleth, you recognize at a glance of your eye, this necromantic leap. This is a Blight spell.
Sam: Blight spell?
Laura: Who's doing a Blight spell?
Sam: Larkin.
Matt: Larkin.
Sam: He's secretly Raishan!
Liam: What? Where did that dwarf come from? Did you hire more mercenaries? When are they showing up? Hey, I'll own it. It's fine. It's been a long week.
Matt: Yenk turns around with a grin. (impacts) Coming forward.
Sam: Yes, Yenk.
Matt: Is going to make three attacks, and has advantage on these attacks, because it's prone. A five and a one. Are you serious? Misses the first strike, with advantage. Hits with the second attack. Hits with the third. Okay, so that's going to be 48 points of damage from Yenk. Slams a fist once and glides off the scales. Second one goes and slams into the side of Vorugal's neck, and then picks up the hoof and jams it into the side of the skull, cracking into the side of Vorugal's head. You can see some teeth break and get thrown off and scatter into the ice and snow nearby. At the end of Yenk's turn, Vorugal is going to go ahead and use two actions to wing attack once more, getting up. Let's see. Yenk's going to have to make a strength save. Fails. Kima fails, as well. They are both knocked prone and suffer bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Only if you're right on him? I'm only two squares away, I think.
Matt: You are also within 15 feet, Grog, technically, so I need you to make a strength saving throw.
Travis: 17?
Matt: 17 does not cut it. You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone.
Liam: All the trees are down.
Matt: It's rough. And Vorugal gets half its speed.
Taliesin: Oh no. He's even starting to move? I'm laying into him. Spending a grit point and I'm knocking him in the foot, back prone before he can even stand up.
Matt: Okay. How many grit points do you have, by the way, now?
Taliesin: This is my third or fourth because I did crit, so I got one back.
Matt: You did. This is correct.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Taliesin: That's a d10 and a d6, and another d6. 12 points of damage, plus one necrotic and two psychic, so 15 points of damage, and he has a save against 19.
Matt: That's a natural 20. Has disadvantage because of your--
Taliesin: No, I was about to say, it's a save, not a check.
Matt: Oh, right. Strength checks. So natural 20. Unaffected.
Taliesin: Unaffected? Again!
Matt: This is your last grit point.
Marisha: Can't say we're not honest.
Taliesin: Blowing it. It's worth it. Gun jams.
Matt: Gun jams.
Taliesin: You know what happens.
Matt: So as you go to fire Animus, it charges up for a second and blasts back, and you watch as a bolt of necrotic energy shoots up Percy's arm and into his head and bursts at his temples. You take 2d6 points of psychic damage.
Ashley: Does the spiritual weapon get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: No, it doesn't get attacks of opportunity. It's not a creature.
Taliesin: Ow. That's the end of my turn. I'm going to dive down and hide and hold.
Matt: That ends Yenk's turn. It's now Vorugal's turn. Gets the breath back. Turns around here. At the giant cluster of shit here.
Sam: He does not see me!
Matt: Doesn't need to. You're in a very big space there. I need Pike, Scanlan, and Keyleth to all make constitution saving throws.
Marisha: The cloak doesn't have anything to do with this, right?
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words to reduce the attack?
Matt: It's not an attack. It's an effect that happens.
Marisha: With advantage? Natural 20!
Matt: With advantage? Why do you get advantage?
Marisha: I thought you said advantage.
Matt: No.
Marisha: Fucking fuck! Well, then I guess I reroll.
Liam: Rolled two dice.
Matt: Roll one dice.
Marisha: I should have kept the first one. That's an 18, which is good! 23.
Matt: Okay. Scanlan?
Sam: 13. I add nothing to it, right?
Taliesin: Is it constitution saving? Plus two.
Matt: 23. Pike, what did you get?
Ashley: Nine.
Matt: Nine. Kima failed. So that is 72 points of cold damage to Scanlan, Pike, and Kima.
Ashley: Divided between us all, right? (laughter)
Matt: No, sorry. Halved to you.
Marisha: That's 36?
Ashley: Just 72?
Matt: Wait, does one of you have the Cold Snap armor on?
Laura: I do.
Matt: Oh yeah. So yeah, 36 cold damage to you, Keyleth. 72 to both of you and Kima. And Vorugal is then going to get back a bit and fly a little higher.
Taliesin: He moved really far in one turn.
Matt: The wing effect is a legendary action on somebody else's turn, and then on his turn, he has a speed of 80 feet, flying.
Taliesin: Even halved?
Matt: He's not affected by cold. Sorry, white dragon.
Taliesin: We're still going to need you, then, apparently.
Matt: That's going to end Vorugal's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Oh, well, he's in the air, which is my preference, all around. Can I get up, please? Now we're somewhere. Can I move directly under him as far as I can go?
Matt: That's half movement, so that's about as far as you can get right now.
Travis: Can I haste or pick my nose to go any further?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Liam: Hold for him to drop?
Travis: I will hold until he drops.
Liam: Oh, sad Grog.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Jesus. I will continue my movement clockwise around the board.
Matt: This way, you mean? That's your movement.
Sam: How far is he from me? A long way.
Matt: Quite a ways right now, yeah.
Sam: 150 to 200 feet?
Matt: Not quite that much, no. Maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 feet.
Sam: Has my invisibility dropped when I got blasted?
Matt: Actually, make a concentration check with advantage, because you have War Caster.
Sam: Concentration? Is it plus anything?
Matt: It's a constitution saving throw.
Sam: 14.
Matt: 14. Yeah, no. You had to beat a 36 because of the damage from the ice blast. Yeah, your invisibility drops. You are now fully visible.
Sam: Okay. Is he within 120 feet of me?
Matt: Yeah, he's within 120 feet, probably.
Sam: All right, I'll punch him in the face.
Matt: Bigby's Hand?
Sam: Yeah. I will Bigby's Hand him.
Matt: All right. Bigby's Hand flies up to meet Vorugal.
Liam: Can you yank his shit down?
Sam: He's way too big. I can try to grab a wing.
Marisha: Can you grapple him? Grapple a wing?
Sam: DM, how does this work? I cannot grapple anything above a huge monster. Can I grapple part of a gargantuan monster?
Matt: Unfortunately, he's just too big for Bigby's Hand.
Sam: So I just punch him. Simply a punch. Bigby's Hand!
Matt: Roll a d20 plus your spell attack bonus.
Sam: 17.
Matt: 17. (whoosh) The fist swings past. Vorugal dodges out of the way, batting his wings and getting out of the trajectory of the fist that just streaks by harmlessly.
Sam: Great. I think I'm within range of Lady Kima? I can inspire her, maybe?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: You know what? Fuck her. I'm going to heal myself. (laughter)
Sam: She crossed me one too many times.
Marisha: She crossed you?
Sam: Fuck her.
Laura: Poor Kima. Trying to get mind-wiped so many times by him.
Marisha: He's a dick to her, and now he's angry about it.
Sam: Healing Word. Can I do level two? That's 2d4 plus six now?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: 12 points. Great. Okay. Thanks.
Matt: All righty. That's your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: Oh jeez! Really? Okay. So I'm right there. Am I within 60 feet?
Matt: Maybe.
Liam: I'm going to fly 20 feet forward through the storm toward him.
Matt: Okay. That will put you right about there.
Liam: Yeah. Dagger, dagger, dagger.
Laura: Oh, you have three daggers still?
Liam: They come back, man. First is 26. Second is a 17, but I'm going to use my second Luck, so the second is a 21. And the third is 19.
Matt: All right. The 17 and 19 miss.
Liam: Okay, so the first one was really high. The second two are mediocre.
Matt: The first one hits. The other two streak off.
Liam: Whisper hits.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Does he get sneak attack because I'm on the flank with my hand?
Liam: No, I didn't think so. That is terrible. That's just ten. And I use my movement to fly directly under him.
Matt: Okay. You're not going with Whisper?
Liam: Say again?
Matt: You're not going with Whisper?
Liam: No.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: No... Yes, I am.
Matt: Are you?
Liam: Could I have hit him in the tail?
Matt: If you want to, sure. Why not? You impact.
Liam: I got the blade on his tail, and I'm there.
Matt: Okay. You're right there with Vorugal.
Marisha: It's becoming a Jenga mini-game.
Liam: That's where I am.
Matt: All righty. That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to try to hit him a couple times.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: My moves are really intricate. 25 for the first one, and I'm using Blazing Bowstring on this. Okay. (counting) Oh! Okay. I have 40 points of damage on the first hit, two of which are lightning, seven of which are fire damage.
Matt: 40.
Laura: And I get sneak attack because Vax is on him.
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Is that Fenthras?
Laura: It's Fenthras. And then 25 on the second hit.
Sam: Points of damage?!
Laura: No, that's just to attack. Oh, jeez Louise. (counting) 23 on the second one, with four points of lightning damage and two points of fire damage.
Matt: All right. So that's your turn?
Laura: And I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.
Matt: Okay. Roll a stealth check.
Laura: Pass Without a Trace still on me?
Matt: No, because you used Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Right. So that is 27.
Matt: Okay, good to know. End of your turn, Vorugal is going to use his legendary action to make a tail attack against Vax.
Liam: Is that melee? Can I use Uncanny Dodge?
Matt: You can if it hits you, yeah. So that is a 26?
Liam: Shite! Yeah, Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Okay. So as you get up there and the arrows smack into the sides, from both Vex's attacks--
Liam: Wait! I want to use my last Luck to make him roll again. Which I can do.
Matt: Okay, you can. That is 27.
Liam: Wow. It's all right. Uncanny Dodge!
Taliesin: No, what are you going to do? Ancient white dragon. Someone's going to get knocked unconscious.
Matt: 23 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail (whack) slams you in the side, almost breaking one of the wings off, and you just manage to catch yourself in the air. So 28, and you can half that. All right. So that ends Vex's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: All right.
Sam: Do that Divine Intervention thing again. That was really good.
Ashley: It's been a week, right? One week is one round, right? Okay. So what I'd like to do... Here's a question. Flame Strike, since it comes from the sky, would it work since he's up in the sky? Comes from above.
Matt: Ten-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder. Centered around a point within range. So it's a 60-foot range. Doesn't say it has to be on the ground, per se.
Ashley: All right, let's give it a try.
Laura: Do it towards the front of Vorugal, so it doesn't hit Vax.
Liam: Hit him in the face.
Laura: Hit him in the face.
Matt: Ten-foot radius. Yeah. You can direct it where it's not going to hit Vax.
Liam: Thanks, Matt.
Matt: (laughs) All right, so what's your spell DC?
Ashley: 18.
Matt: 18. This is dex, right? It's a 21. He succeeds, so that's half damage. Go ahead and roll damage on that. It's 8d6 damage.
Laura: Oh, do you even have to roll the attack on that?
Matt: It explodes, and it's a saving throw to see if he manages to avoid some of the damage, which he did. What did you get?
Sam: It's ten-foot radius? Ten-foot diameter?
Matt: Ten-foot radius.
Sam: It doesn't hit the Hand, does it?
Matt: No. She's directing it in a way where it hits the front of him. It bursts right through his head and the edge of his wings.
Ashley: 19.
Travis: And two more. That's 8d6.
Laura: It's 8d6?
Matt: 8d6, yeah.
Ashley: Oh! (giggles) Do I add anything else?
Matt: Just those.
Ashley: What is it? 29.
Matt: 29. All right. So 14 points of damage with the halved. (explosion) The blast hits; the flames spin around. You see Vorugal starting to look a bit rough now. It's getting angry; wings are beating faster. You can see there's a feral desperation in Vorugal's eyes right now at all the things that are starting to come at him.
Ashley: I'm going to stay put. And for bonus action, I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself.
Matt: Okay. All right. At the end of your turn, Pike, using another legendary action to make another tail attack at Vax, trying to beat you away from behind at this point. That is a 25.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: That hits? Okay.
Liam: And I'm out of Uncanny Dodge, right?
Matt: Well, you can only make one reaction per round, yeah. That'll put you at 14 points of bludgeoning damage. (whack) Right at your side this time. Though you were able to dodge most of the first impact, this one smacks you to your side, and you spiral over for a second, catching yourself, and still keep afloat right there. All right, that brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. I am going to cast Earthbind on him.
Matt: Earthbind. What's the range on Earthbind?
Marisha: 300 feet.
Matt: Yeah, that will do it. All right, what's the saving throw on it? Saving throw on that is a strength saving throw. All right, that is a failure. It's going to use one of its legendary resistances to make it. (groaning)
Taliesin: Good, you've burned it. Had to burn it.
Marisha: (frustrated noise)
Travis: She's speaking Parseltongue. (laughter)
Marisha: I am going to do a bonus action to cast Healing Word on myself. Heal myself real quick. Same thing, I want to scoot back a little bit, behind that tree, a bit.
Matt: Right behind here?
Marisha: Yeah, because I got whacked with that ice breath, and I don't want that to happen again. All right.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn? At the end of your turn, he's going to use his third and final legendary action to make another tail swipe at Vax. That is a 27.
Liam: You've hit me right now? Yeah, that hits.
Matt: Okay. This third tail strike right now is going to do 17 points of bludgeoning damage. (impacts) You've been battered in the air by the white dragon tail swinging behind. The focus is less on you as it's hitting you, and it's focusing on the whole battlefield down in front of it and the giant demon that is still lying on the ground.
Liam: Thanks, Heroes' Feast.
Matt: That brings us up to Percy.
Taliesin: I am going to heal, as my bonus action. That's not bad. That's 19 points. I'm a little better now. I'm at 108; I'm fine. Now, I'm going to take out Bad News. Fuck Animus for now. Take out Bad News and take two shots at this bastard with sharpshooter.
Laura: What's Yenk doing down there? Sleeping?
Matt: Yenk got knocked prone.
Taliesin: For fuck's sake!
Sam: Gun jam?
Taliesin: Yeah, gun jammed.
Matt: Fire again, this time (click, explosion). You see a burst of smoke come out, and part of the metal slightly bends. And you're like, "Shit!"
Sam: All your guns?
Taliesin: No, I have one more gun. But I don't have time. That burns an action.
Matt: Yeah. You could use your action surge, if you wanted to.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm using my action surge. Might as well.
Marisha: You try to unjam it?
Taliesin: No, I'm taking out my last pistol and I'm shooting. I'm just going to shoot. See if I can take two more shots. Technically not; it's two shots.
Matt: No, if you're pulling your next gun out. You're not trying to repair?
Taliesin: No, I'm not trying to repair.
Matt: You'd still have two more attacks. Yeah, because you have quick draw. You drop Bad News, grab another weapon. You still have two more attacks.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm taking two more shots, then. Sharpshooter shot with Retort. No, it's different. 16.
Matt: Nope. Fires off in the distant cloud.
Laura: It's that new damn gun. Its sight is all shit.
Taliesin: Ah! That one hits, on the other hand, I think. 22?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That's not much, but I'll take it. Nine points of normal damage plus two necrotic, so that's 11 points of damage. No, 21 points of damage. I'm so sorry.
Matt: Right, with the ten. Yeah. There you go. 21. First one misses. (click) You set it up. This time, takes a shot. (impact) It hits Vorugal from underneath a few feet off from where Vax is. You can see the wound beginning to bleed now. The more damage Vorugal gets, the more you can see the trickle of reddish-blue blood darkening against the white skin. Vorugal is looking fairly damaged.
Taliesin: I'm going to burn my action surge and take three more shots. Fuck it. See if I can lose the third gun. It's that night, apparently. No, I will not. That's 18?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: Fuck the sharpshooter shot. I'm just going for it. No sharpshooter. Thank god! That's 20?
Matt: 20 just hits.
Taliesin: Excellent. Good to know. Oh my god, that's bullshit. Ten points, three necrotic, so it's ten points of damage.
Matt: Your final shot?
Taliesin: My final shot. No, it didn't. This one doesn't do that. That's nice, but I miss. That's 16. That misses.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Thankfully, it doesn't burn that gun. No, that gun is better built. I'm rolling really poorly.
Matt: That ends your turn. That comes to Kima's turn. Kima is going to get up.
Travis: Come on, represent us melee-ers!
Laura: The three of you down on the ground.
Matt: I know. This is a rough fight for the melee.
Travis: I'm making a mean face, so far.
Marisha: You're mad-dogging the dragon?
Matt: Did maintain concentration. That's good. Kima's going to use a bonus action to heal you, Grog, for nine points. Nine health, using her Aura of Vitality.
Sam: Why wouldn't she heal me?
Matt: She's not close enough to you, unfortunately.
Sam: And she hates me.
Matt: Yeah, you may have pissed her off. She will move up into range with Yenk, but she can't actually attack. Too much ice, and her legs are not the longest, and she's having a hard time getting in the fray, but now she's locked in the battle.
Sam: Larkin's turn.
Laura: Good old Larkin!
Sam: Good old Larkin! Come on, Larkin. Bring him down!
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Where is Yenk?
Taliesin: Yenk ain't got nothing but us to hit right now. Let's not dwell on that.
Matt: It's Larkin's turn, technically.
Sam: (singing) You see him Larkin. You hating. (laughter)
Matt: You watch as the tiny dwarf form looks around at the chaos here, and with how things are going, "Shite!"
Laura: Don't you fucking ditch! Don't you ditch out!
Matt: His form vanishes as a green dragon appears. (shouting)
Liam: Cards on the table!
Matt: All right, uses the movement to fly up.
Marisha: Is she going to go for him?
Laura: She's going! She's doing it. She's so teeny compared to him!
Matt: She is a diseased dragon. And releases (blows air) cold blast of poison breath at this direction.
Marisha: Heroes' Feast, man.
Matt: As the billowing cloud of toxic fumes fills you, you instinctually freak out for a second before you realize that the magical protection in your lungs is preventing any of it from taking hold inside. That's cocked. It does make its save.
Sam: What kind of save is it?
Matt: It's a constitution.
Sam: Does the Hand need to make a save? Hand has an AC of 20 and my hit points.
Matt: I don't know if the poison's going to affect Bigby's Hand. It'is arcane. It's not going to affect that. That's for more of physically hitting it. However, Vorugal does end up taking 38 points of poison damage.
Sam: And then Vax goes, "Wait a second, Larkin was a dragon?!" (laughter)
Matt: Okay, at this point, that's going to end Raishan's turn. Yenk gets up, looking at the battlefield. He sees this giant, hulking goliath. Well, technically with Seeming, a large dragonborn with an axe. Lurches forward. Kima gets an attack of opportunity against Yenk.
Laura: Would he still look like a little dragonborn?
Matt: No, his physical form still shifts into a larger one. He looks smaller than his actual self, I guess, comparatively. We'll say for the fun element of it, he still looks like a bigger dragonborn, as Grog wants to look bigger on this one. Kima does hit Yenk. She's going to use Divine Smite, 4th-level spell against him as part of that. Ooh! That's going to be nice.
Taliesin: Remember to go into the stomach, if it goes. We've got a relic in its stomach.
Marisha: Don't eviscerate him. It's fine. It's not going anywhere.
Matt: 21 plus 4d8. 5d8 because it is a fiend.
Travis: Yeah! 5d8 because it is a fiend!
Matt: I don't want to rob her of any awesome damage here.
Travis: Yeah, come on. For the very few times Kima gets to get shake the dust off.
Matt: I know. Seriously!
Marisha: It does look like he's copping a feel.
Sam: Cupping?
Ashley: Little pinch.
Matt: She gets additional 1d8. It's 5d8 additional damage.
Sam: Trumping right now?
Marisha: No, this is our fantasy land, man.
Taliesin: No! Nixing it! This is my safe place.
Matt: 48 points of damage in one strike from Kima against Yenk.
Travis: Just from the attack of opportunity?
Matt: Just attack of opportunity, yeah. She poured a level four Divine Smite spell into it and (impacts) as she slams behind. Fiends are a paladin's thing. As Yenk's running away towards you, Grog, she says, "No, you don't!" (impacts) Slams up with her maul and strikes at the side of Yenk, causing him to tumble. He's still keeping his trajectory, though. He slams forward towards you. That's more than 15 feet. He's going for a gore attack against you, Grog, with the horns, like he did with Vorugal at the beginning of the battle.
Liam: He's going to take 15 percent of your hit points.
Matt: (chuckles) Yeah. That is a 22.
Travis: That'll hit.
Sam: Can I Cutting Words that?
Matt: I don't think you're in range.
Sam: Am I 60 feet?
Matt: 60 feet? Let me se. 60. Just out of range. You suffer 55 points of piercing damage from the horns, halved, plus an additional 38 points of piercing damage from the momentum from the gore.
Travis: And you said additional 30?
Matt: Additional 38.
Travis: Additional 38, so that's halved also. 19?
Matt: 19 on top of the half. Plus an additional seven points of cold damage as the horns strike into you, the horns almost solidify into ice spikes as it hits you, the ice breaking off.
Sam: Would have been great against a fucking dragon.
Laura: It did. It did the fire damage against the dragon.
Travis: 48 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. There you go. That ends Yenk's turn. It is now Vorugal's turn. Vorugal's pissed and hurt and angry and is going to move away.
Laura: You get an attack of opportunity!
Liam: Did he move away?
Matt: You do get one, yeah.
Liam: Yeah. No sneak attack because it's just me and Bigby, right?
Matt: Currently, yes. You don't get sneak attack here, no.
Liam: Right, because there's nobody here with me. 27 hits, so that is a three plus eight is 11, plus my psychic damage is 12.
Laura: How do you want to do this?
Liam: That'd be great, cut him in the butt.
Matt: Nice. That's some good luck with the ice breath this battle.
Travis: There are three giant monsters.
Marisha: Jesus, he's back for my shit. He's back for me and you, Pike.
Matt: I need Keyleth, Pike, and Scanlan to all make constitution saving throws.
Sam: Oh boy.
Marisha: Okay. 18.
Matt: 18.
Sam: 15.
Matt: Pike? All right, all three of you guys take 72 points of cold damage.
Laura: Okay. So that's unconscious.
Matt: So Pike is unconscious. Scanlan?
Sam: I'm okay.
Matt: You're okay? What's your hit points?
Sam: I healed myself last time just the amount of hit points I have right now.
Matt: (laughs) Keyleth, where you at?
Marisha: I'm at 36. Luckily I also healed myself up.
Liam: I'm a field medic. I'll get you out.
Matt: All right, and for the rest of Vorugal's turn...
Laura: What the fuck are you doing now, Matthew?
Marisha: This isn't good.
Laura: Are you unconscious, too?
Marisha: I'm up, but Pike isn't, correct?
Matt: Pike is currently unconscious, yeah. That ends Vorugal's turn. Grog, you're up.
Sam: You're not unconscious, Marisha?
Marisha: I'm not. Pike is. There is an exit door. We can literally toss Pike's ass in the door. How many are you down, Pike?
Travis: Can I go to a frenzied rage and unload on Yenk?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Okay. This will be reckless attack. Great weapon master. Because fuck it. Why not? 28 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Natural 20. (shouting)
Ashley: Get him.
Travis: And 27 for the third.
Matt: Yeah, all three hit. The middle one gets critical. Don't forget your additional 1d4 damage with your axe because you're enlarged.
Marisha: And those were all great weapon master? That's fucking awesome!
Travis: The first one is 15 plus six points of necrotic damage. 21.
Matt: Including the 1d4?
Travis: 25.
Matt: 25. Does that includes the ten for great weapon master?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: So 35 points of damage on the first strike. All right. Second attack, which is the critical.
Laura: All dice are doubled? Is that how it works?
Matt: Yeah, all dice rolls double. Roll a d12, plus d6, plus d4.
Travis: That's an 11. It's a six. One.
Matt: 18 times two. (laughs) 36 plus ten. 46, plus 2d12 because of brutal critical.
Travis: One. Six. Seven. Seven extra points.
Matt: Plus 46. 53 points of damage with the second strike. Roll damage for the third one.
Liam: Maniac! Here it is! Get it!
Sam: Finally, he gets to attack! It's been six months since we've seen you actually attack anything.
Laura: I know, and he kills everything.
Liam: This is a rage spanking, right here.
Travis: 28 on the third one.
Matt: 28 on the third. Nice. You did over 100 damage on one round of melee combat.
Laura: Did you add your ten to the final one? It was 38 on the final.
Matt: (laughs) Jesus! So as you angrily get up, your large, draconic form, you rush forward, stepping right up to where Yenk is slamming into you. And after goring you in the chest, you embrace the anger and (impacts) bring the axe down, right into the inside of the shoulder. For the final attack, you put a foot up and drag it down across, cutting into it. You see a bunch of black-blue blood scatter across the snow, darkening it, the snow immediately melting with a (sizzling) hissing sound as it impacts with the ground around you. Yenk looks visibly hurt now. He's like, (pained grunts).
Laura: Can we see a little spire poking through its belly?
Matt: No, but you do see that the red, beady, coal-like flame eyes of Yenk are now burning with a vibrant red and are focused entirely on you.
Travis: I've got everything you want, big boy.
Matt: All right. That ends Grog's turn, I believe? Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Me? Oh, shit. Okay.
Matt: Actually, at the end of Grog's turn, Vorugal is going to use one of his legendary actions to attempt a tail attack, which has a reach of 20 feet. You are within 20 feet.
Sam: Against me?
Matt: Yep. That is cocked. 18 plus 14 is 32?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: You take (counting) 16 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: I'm going to use Cutting Words to reduce the damage. As I see the tail coming, I pick up my book of Shakespeare insults, and I will say: with thy brawls, thou hast disturbed our sport! I love thee not. Therefore, pursue me not.
Matt: As the tail swings towards you, roll a d12.
Sam: Six. And I live. (laughter)
Sam: It was 14 points of damage?
Matt: It was seven plus eight, so it would have been 16. It was eight plus eight. 16.
Sam: So reduced to ten. I'm okay. I have four points left.
Matt: Oh shit!
Sam: My turn?
Matt: Now it's your turn.
Sam: I look at Pike, and with my bonus action, I will heal her. Healing Word, second level. I will sing to her, (singing) you're trying to kill a white dragon, just like the ones we used to kill. May your days be merry and bright, and I hope we all survive this fight. (speaking) Okay, so 2d4, right?
Matt: 2d4 plus six.
Sam: 13 points.
Matt: Pike is up 13 points.
Sam: Shit. I've got to get out of here. Are you okay, Pike?
Ashley: I am at 13.
Sam: Are you going to be okay?
Ashley: Well, I'm going to run away. I'll be fine.
Marisha: Don't forget, you can go in the mansion. Pop in the mansion to heal.
Sam: I don't want to be a coward.
Laura: You can be a coward, Scanlan. It's okay.
Ashley: You're at four, Scanlan.
Sam: Shit. Well, I'll move away from it. Wait, I'm within its melee?
Matt: Yes, you are within range.
Sam: Jesus. That far away?
Matt: It has a 15-foot bite reach, a ten-foot claw reach, and a 20-foot tail reach.
Sam: Oh my god. Okay. I don't want to hit it. I don't want to go away. Fuck. I don't want to leave my Pikey. I'm not going to leave my Pikey. You never leave your wingman. No.
Laura: Four, Scanlan! Get somewhere safe. That way, you can keep helping her.
Marisha: If he takes you down and multi-attacks you, he could kill you. You healed her, right? She's conscious now.
Sam: I Dimension Door away.
Matt: To where?
Sam: Over in Yenkville, but not in Yenk range.
Matt: Over here?
Sam: Yeah, there you go.
Travis: In Yenk-adjacent?
Sam: Yeah. The suburbs of Yenkville.
Liam: Mighty Yenky has struck out.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Vax.
Liam: I know that from here to here, I'm 100 feet, so from the angle, am I 180 feet away to Pike?
Matt: Scanlan, by the way, I need you to make two concentration saving throws. Make two constitution saves.
Sam: With advantage?
Matt: Well, it's one of them with advantage, so roll twice.
Sam: I rolled twice. One was a 17 and one was a ten.
Matt: Yeah, even with the bonuses, Bigby's Hand is gone.
Taliesin: It would have been 19.
Matt: You took full damage from the last blast, so that would have been 72. Half of that would have been-- you had to roll a 36.
Liam: I want to save one action to grab Pike and yank her, so that means I have an action and a bonus action and movement to fly a total of 360 feet, halved, which is 180 feet to Pike, like a rocket. Grab her and roll into the door of the mansion.
Matt: Okay, so as you dart past and grab her--
Laura: Oh, does he get an attack of opportunity on you because you fly by?
Liam: I can arc.
Matt: You're then taking your action to grab her.
Liam: And roll us into the door.
Matt: Okay. You are leaving his combat range in doing so, so he's going to get his attack of opportunity on you, as part of his bite strike against you. That is 18 plus 14, so 32.
Liam: That hits. Do I have momentum, grabbing her?
Matt: If it drops you, you drop, and you drop with her.
Liam: I would imagine I did this. That's the intention. Up and over.
Matt: I understand that. The attack of a bite is going to change your trajectory of a dragon slashing at you. That is eight--
Liam: I'm out, dude. I've got five hit points.
Matt: Total would be eight plus eight, plus an additional 4d6 cold damage. Yeah. You grab Pike. As you begin to try to make the way, the bite snatches into you and lifts you up and throws you to the ground next to Pike, and you're both there on the ground.
Liam: But he bit me, right?
Matt: Yes, didn't bite Pike. You're both right outside of the door right now.
Sam: Pike's alive, and she's super strong.
Marisha: I'm just watching everybody barrel to my feet?
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Laura: My boyfriend!
Matt: That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Fuck. I'm going to try to get his attention and say, hey, stupid! And then I'm going to hit him because that's all I've got.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Laura: 22?
Matt: 22 does hit.
Laura: Do I have sneak attack on him, at all? Marisha is next to him.
Matt: No, he's within range for Marisha. Marisha is not threatening him, at the moment.
Laura: So no sneak attack, although I was hidden at the end of last turn.
Matt: You were. He did not see you.
Ashley: I'm threatening him.
Matt: (laughs) You're growling at him.
Laura: (counting) 28 on the first.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: That was damage. And then the second attack hits. It's a 31. (counting)
Matt: These are sharpshooter shots? It's the 1d10, plus bonus--
Laura: 1d8, plus eight, plus two for dragon, plus Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Right, there we go. Second one is how much damage?
Laura: 24, with two lighting damage. The first one had four lightning damage.
Matt: Okay. Does that end your turn?
Laura: (sighs) I want to help, I just don't know what I can do. That's all I can keep doing. I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.
Matt: Go for it. Roll a stealth check.
Laura: Like an asshole. 13.
Matt: Okay. End of your turn, Vorugal's going to use his second legendary action and is going to swing around with the tail over the top of the rock (impact) to slam down on the conscious Pike. You are prone. It has advantage on the attack roll against you. That is 28 to hit.
Ashley: Yeah, that hits.
Matt: 22 points of bludgeoning damage.
Ashley: I'm out.
Matt: Pike's now unconscious. Okay. Vorugal is now in this ravenous, primal rage, and is trying to finish things off successively that have been a problem. Now, with that, both of them are unconscious on the ground, Scanlan's out of the picture, Keyleth is still standing right by the side of the tree. Pike, you're up next, so I need you to go ahead and roll a death saving throw. Roll a d20.
Taliesin: This is where being at the end of everything is great.
Liam: 20.
Matt: A 20? Natural 20? You are stabilized. You gain one hit point. You're conscious.
Marisha: Holy shit. That changes everything!
Ashley: I'll take that hit point. Okay. I don't even know what that means.
Matt: You're conscious again. The tail slams you, and you go out, and then as the tail pulls away, (gasps) you catch yourself again. Your turn's over, but you're back. Pulling the tail back. That's the end of your turn.
Ashley: I didn't do anything.
Matt: Your turn was the death saving throw. You take that at the end of your turn. You woke up at the end of it. At the end of your turn, Vorugal uses the third and final legendary action for this round and with a 20-foot range, is going to swing the tail around, breaking through the tree, towards Keyleth. That is a 29 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah. Wait, is this melee? Does this come into play with the cloak? So you're at disadvantage.
Matt: That is a 24. Ancient dragon, sorry. That is 22 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: And that's it? I'm still alive! (roars) 22? Okay. I have 14 hit points.
Matt: All right. Now it's your turn, Keyleth.
Marisha: Now it's my turn.
Liam: Go earth elemental!
Marisha: I'm so torn, you guys. Do I heal you guys, or do I do damage and go earth elemental? It's a big decision. Scanlan?
Sam: It's all on you.
Marisha: Pike, you're at one?
Ashley: I'm at one.
Marisha: You're down.
Travis: I'm doing real good.
Marisha: What do I do, guys? Do I try and kill him, or do I heal?
Sam: You've got two nearly dead people right next to you who are feet away from a mansion.
Laura: Can you Grasping Vine them through the mansion door? It's open, right?
Matt: The vine wouldn't pull them through the door because you can only create it within a space where a natural plant would grow.
Marisha: It doesn't work like that, unfortunately.
Sam: But you can throw them, as a beasty elemental.
Matt: What are you going to do, Keyleth? Hurry up.
Marisha: Okay, fuck!
Sam: When I left the mansion, I locked it.
Travis: Did the key break off when you locked it?
Sam: No, it's a code lock. And I forgot the code!
Marisha: I'm going to cast Sunbeam. I'm going to beam in his face.
Sam: On Yenk, of course.
Marisha: It's okay. I've got this. Beam in his face.
Matt: Okay, so you cast Sunbeam. 60-foot line, five-foot wide. Right past that way. Okay.
Taliesin: Actually, does that hit both of them?
Marisha: 60 foot, right through them? Can I?
Matt: You might have to reposition to do so.
Marisha: What, scooch over one? Yeah, I'll scooch over one. Take a side step to line them up.
Matt: You get around the tree and past the rock. Yeah, you can hit both of them.
Marisha: They have to make a constitution save.
Matt: Vorugal, that is a 32. Yenk is a 27. They both make it.
Marisha: Well, they still take half damage. It's 6d8. Normally, they take full damage and they're blinded. It would have been way cooler if it would have worked. Ooh, that's a good roll. 26 points of radiant damage.
Matt: 26, then halved?
Marisha: Then halved. And then I'm going to go air elemental form.
Matt: Embracing the age-old tradition of the Air Ashari, Keyleth vanishes into a form of swirling wind, picking up the various bits of sleet and snow around you. You're almost like a slushy tornado.
Marisha: That's cool. Can I then take whatever movement I have left to try and drag--
Matt: You've already used your action to cast the spell, unfortunately.
Marisha: I can't use my movement to try and move someone?
Matt: You can use your movement to move. To pull somebody with you--
Marisha: That's an action?
Liam: It's all right. I'm fine.
Marisha: Then I'm going to use my movement to go airborne. I think I can go 60 feet? Let me see my fly speed. I have 90 feet.
Matt: 90 feet, so it would be 45 feet up, if you want to.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Kick him on the way up, and then he'll follow you.
Marisha: I give him a little air poof kick in the face, just for flavor.
Matt: Sure, why not?
Marisha: He's getting slushied in the face.
Matt: You rush up into the air. Vorugal does not get an attack of opportunity because he already used his reaction against you. So you (whoosh) without an issue.
Marisha: I hope that was right.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Percy.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to take my three shots.
Matt: Right above you, you see Raishan, wings beating, looking over and assessing the battlefield. You see Vorugal down there, bloody. You see Yenk, bloodied. Both engaged and distracted. You are currently not in either of their attentive sphere.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to reload. I'm going to take my three shots at the white dragon with what I have left. I can do nothing. That's 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Taliesin: One necrotic. 12 points, with one necrotic. Shot number one. Next shot, same thing. Standard shot. That ran, but 22? Oh, sorry. It's not 22. I'm so tired. 17. That misses.
Matt: 17 misses, unfortunately. It hits the side, but the shot shatters across the dragonhide.
Ashley: Can I do War God's Blessing from where I'm at?
Matt: You know what? Hold on, Percy. You are conscious on the ground, barely paying attention, and all of a sudden, you hear the shot go off, and you see it about to blast against the hide. As a war cleric? I'll see if he has to be within range, or if it's one of the things that you can do if he attacks an enemy. The creature has to be within 30 feet of you, so no. He's way too far.
Taliesin: 24 for the next shot.
Matt: Third one does hit.
Taliesin: That's 12 points, with two points of necrotic. And I'm going to grab my rope, and I'm going to wave at the green dragon and start dropping down.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I have a rope.
Matt: I know you do. As you leap off the side, the clench in the stone (tink) comes loose, and you (impacts) tumble down the hill. I need you to make an acrobatics check.
Taliesin: Yeah! I can do that, even at negative one, I can do that. No, I can't. That was a one.
Matt: Natural one? You tumble Homer Simpson-style (repeated impacts) down the icy, rocky side, landing prone and suffering 18 points of bludgeoning damage on the way, landing prone on the ground. (impact, groan)
Taliesin: Fine!
Matt: Kima's turn. Kima's going to go and flank Yenk against Grog, giving her advantage on her first attack. Yeah, that's a 25 to hit, and her second attack is-- yeah, both hit. The first strike with her Holy Thunder Maul. 19 points of damage against the goristro, and she's going to burn another 3rd-level spell to do a holy smite at third level. All righty. 23 additional radiant damage on top of that, and then her second strike, she's going to burn her last 3rd-level spell to do another smite. That is 16. (counting) 31. Nice! Yeah, she did a lot of damage on that round. Slamming twice with the maul into the backside of Yenk. The first one slams into the shoulder, sending him to the ground with his fist. (grunts) He starts getting back up. She spins, using the inertia, and slams the maul into the side of his knee, which pops out and sends him down onto one knee now, and Yenk is basically half-prostrate in front of you, Grog, preparing for your next round of combat. (growls) Ending Kima's turn. It is now Raishan's turn.
Travis: She made him bend the knee.
Matt: Raishan does not get the breath back. However, is going to fly. Not used to the ice and can't quite get to full speed there, but can get close enough to attempt a Blight spell, at the very least. Vorugal fails. That's an 18. Yeah, fails the save.
Laura: Blight spell.
Marisha: A lot of damage. Come on.
Sam: He's going to resist it.
Taliesin: He might have burned it.
Matt: Yeah, burning a legendary resistance to make it happen, so it still makes the save, so it's still half, but it has one left. Okay, so it takes 18 points of necrotic damage. That's the end of that turn. It is now Yenk's turn. Yenk is going to do a full-on multiattack against you, Grog. That is a 24 to hit?
Travis: That'll hit.
Matt: Actually, it has advantage on you because you used reckless attack. That hits. Second one is 26 to hit.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And natural 20. All right.
Travis: I'm going to use my Stone's Endurance on the natural 20, and I'll do retaliation on one of those three hits.
Sam: Retaliation? That's new.
Matt: So the first fist is 29 points of piercing damage, so reduce that to 14, plus three points of fire damage as the fist suddenly bursts into flame as it slams into you. The secondary fist comes swinging around the other way, dealing 20 points of piercing damage, reduced to ten. Plus, you take eight points of lightning damage as suddenly an arc of energy streaks from the fist, slamming into the other side of your face, as you're taking it on each side. As you grin, he leaps up into the air, his strong, thick legs getting almost up above you, then kicks down with its hooves towards you like a very angry goat. This is the critical.
Laura: What does stone's endurance do?
Travis: d12 plus my constitution modifier.
Matt: Reduce the damage, yeah.
Taliesin: I've been hit by a goat in the face before. No, really. I got nailed by a goat.
Liam: At the zoo?
Taliesin: No, we were filming this ridiculous television series called Hell Town when I was a kid. It was awful.
Liam: You weren't trying to call Satan?
Taliesin: Not in the show, either.
Matt: 46 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to 23, plus ten points of ice damage as the hooves slam into you, leaving these frozen cracks where the blood should be emanating from. It seals the wound, almost.
Travis: 14, so I reduce that by 14.
Matt: Correct, reduce that by 14, and then make your retaliatory strike.
Travis: Great weapon master, reckless.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: 26?
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 22.
Laura: Plus ten.
Travis: 32.
Matt: 32 points of damage. How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Marisha: Yeah, Grog! Get me that staff!
Travis: When he jumped up and did the hoof kick down, I'm going to take it and then grab his hooves and wishbone him. (cheering)
Matt: As you grab him, you try to begin to pull, and he slams onto the ground, and you see him grab his arms back to try and pull himself back up. You kick him straight down again, and as you laugh, you push your foot into his crotch area as you pull Yenk in half with a sheer show of strength, smearing you with black, burning blood. It does burn you. You do suffer five points of fire damage as the blood that's spurting on you is burning into the skin. You tear him mostly in half. You can see the innards spilling into the snow and melting the snow within a five-foot radius of you as he (death rattle) is still surviving as you pull him apart. As you get closer, he reaches forward and grabs you and palms your head with his last bit of strength and begins to squeeze, and then the fingers eventually go lax before the hand (impact) onto the ground.
Travis: I look at both of the legs in my hands, and I look at Kima and go, which one's lucky?
Matt: She goes, "You are." (laughter)
Matt: That ends Yenk's turn.
Sam: Hey, Matt. Can I rewind?
Matt: No. Sorry. Yenk is done and torn open on the ground.
Marisha: Now we have to deal with the two dragons.
Laura: Well, one. Hopefully.
Taliesin: Yeah, we're going to let one leave. One's going to walk.
Matt: Vorugal is going to go ahead and (whoosh) come up and then--
Sam: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Pike is not currently threatening him. Yeah, with Raishan blasting and seeing the dragon, Vorugal is going to turn this way, behind this space underneath the air elemental. "You betrayer!" (roars) And unleash a blast of frozen death down, hitting Raishan, as well as Vax and Pike. You're unconscious. Vax, you fail a death saving throw automatically.
Marisha: I thought Pike had one hit point.
Matt: RIght. If you make the save, you're still taking 30-something cold damage, so you're down. Automatic one fail on a death saving throw. Raishan does not make the save and takes 72 points of ice damage. Yeah, that's going to end Vorugal's turn, very angrily. All right, that brings us to Grog.
Travis: Yeah. Can I make a quick look down? Do I see any Spire of Conflux?
Matt: Make a quick investigation check.
Travis: In my rage? Natural one. I'm going to take off running toward Vorugal!
Matt: That's as far as you can get on your full movement.
Travis: I'll dash to get as far as I can.
Matt: Yeah, you can get about there. All right, that ends Grog's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I will bonus action take my potion of greater healing, right? That's the medium one?
Matt: Yeah. It's 4d4 plus four.
Sam: Okay. Terrible. Okay. Oh man, that's terrible.
Laura: What did you get?
Sam: 11 total.
Travis: From which potion?
Laura: Greater.
Sam: Okay. Well, shit. I'll move towards the dragon a bit.
Matt: Actually, Percy, make a concentration check, if you could. Make a constitution saving throw for Hex, yeah. Forgot about that.
Taliesin: Constitution saving? That would be a negative one? No, not a negative one. Add negative one. That would be 15.
Matt: 15. For you to take half damage? Yeah. Hex stays. All right. Scanlan?
Sam: There are no options. Not to save our friends! I'm way out of range.
Laura: Can you Dimension Door and then run with her?
Sam: I'm done. I've moved. I've acted. I can throw a ball. I'll throw a Fireball at Big Whitey. Centered way back so it doesn't hit any of my friends.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Sam: Three charges, I guess. What do I do? I just do it.
Matt: That's a natural 20 on his save, so he does make his save.
Sam: What I was going to say, I rewind. Because you didn't let me, he has disadvantage on his save this time, because you didn't let me retroactively go back and do it.
Matt: That's right. Natural one. 20, one.
Travis: Are you kidding me?
Marisha: Burn this motherfucker!
Travis: Every time we have one of these big fights--
Taliesin: There's no middle ground, is there? There's no middle ground at all.
Matt: To be fair, we do a lot of rolls in these big fights.
Travis: We do, but a straight 20 to one flip-flop only happens one time.
Sam: 29.
Marisha: That's pretty good. That's okay.
Matt: (explosion) The explosion hits. You see it sends ice shards shooting everywhere, leaving a big crater on the ground where the snow once was, and part of the stonework is barely scratched. The blast hits Vorugal, and Vorugal (grunts). Looks down at the two unconscious bodies on the ground. Looks up at Raishan. (huffs) Does that end your turn?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: End of your turn, it's going to use two actions to do a wing attack, beating its wings, hitting every creature within 15 feet. You're out of range, actually, Marisha. Grog, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: I think I have advantage on this because of rage. I do. 21.
Matt: 21? That unfortunately fails. You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage, and you're knocked prone. Also, Pike and Vax, you both fail a death saving throw from the bludgeoning winds of the ice dragon's wings beating downward.
Marisha: You guys are at two failed?
Laura: He's at two failed. Pike's at one.
Matt: Vorugal is going to head upward and begin flying this direction to turn tail and flee.
Sam: Do you get an attack because he's flying by you?
Marisha: Yeah, do I get an attack of opportunity here?
Sam: You are right over him.
Matt: You were right over him. As he gets up, I'll give you one. I don't have any more of these things here.
Liam: Blow everything you've got. Blow it. He's leaving. Unleash.
Marisha: Can I do a spell attack on him? It's just melee, right?
Matt: That's specifically a War Caster feat ability.
Marisha: Just one slam attack? Nope. Definitely not.
Taliesin: How fast? Is he still within visual range?
Matt: Currently, yeah. He just moved 40 feet with that one reaction.
Laura: We can still hit him with the ranged?
Matt: Possibly, yeah. That ends Scanlan's turn. Vax, I need you make a death saving throw. You have advantage.
Sam: Advantage?
Liam: 17.
Matt: So you're okay for now. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to hit him twice.
Marisha: Fucking burn this guy down!
Taliesin: Hit him with everything we've got.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Laura: 25 on the first.
Matt: 25 damage? All right, and the second hit?
Laura: The second is also 27.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Marisha: We're going to live!
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: He's taking away, and you have a shot as it's arcing to the right of you, bleeding and limping in the air, but managing to pick up speed. The sleet and snow is strong and firing around you.
Laura: I want to see a cut on his stomach where Yenk left a hole, and I want to go straight into his heart.
Matt: The first arrow, you aim for it. It streaks off and hits another wound and gets jammed in. You pull back with the second arrow, and right as you see the snow beginning to blind, the one moment of clarity that hits you, (arrow firing) you release the arrow, piercing inside where the wound was, where one of Yenk's horns had gashed into the front of his chest. Vorugal (roars) and spins into a corkscrew, plummets and crashes into the side of the ravine, tumbles backward. Rocks come tumbling onto it. Vorugal hits the ground, smacked open. As it begins to get back up, (impacts) a bunch of rocks slam down, and one big shard of ice (impacts) slams into it. (panting) Still writhing in place as he's bleeding out.
Laura: And a tree grows out of his guts.
Matt: He's still currently holding on as he's jammed to the ground. You see the bluish-purple blood leaking out the side of the mouth. (panting) It can't move, and you can see the strength leaving Vorugal's body. Raishan swoops up next to Vorugal's corpse, leaning over. (cackles) "Tell your master on the other side, when you see him, that it was worth it." And Raishan sinks her teeth into his throat and tears it out. You see the spray of blood across Raishan's mouth and across the front of the ravine as Vorugal's body falls limp onto the ground. Spits the chunk of white dragon flesh onto the bottom of the ravine. The green dragon spins around, facing you all. "Well done." And backs into a sitting position. The wings furl down and fold into her side. "Take your spoils. It seems the war is nigh."
Taliesin: There will be a conversation.
Travis: I run as fast as I can over to Pike and Vax.
Taliesin: I run to the body of the big demonic thing and start going through it.
Matt: Okay, roll an investigation check.
Travis: I have two basic potions. I de-cork both of them and shove them in their gullets.
Matt: While that's happening, in the time it takes you guys to rush over, I need you both to make one more death saving throw.
Marisha: Oh, fuck. Come on, you guys.
Liam: A ten and a three! (laughter)
Taliesin: Not funny!
Ashley: 11.
Matt: Grog comes by, scoops you both up, and force-feeds you two basic healing potions. You both come to consciousness bruised, beaten, but apparently the current struggle is done, though you're now shivering, cold, soaked through. All of you, the elements have really sunk in once the adrenaline begins to wear off.
Laura: I fly down and cast Cure Wounds on Vax.
Travis: The two of you, inside the mansion. Now.
Matt: How much do your potions heal for them? It's 1d4 plus four. Sorry, 2d4 plus two.
Marisha: Yes, we do.
Taliesin: Vex, we have a dragon to disassemble.
Marisha: You go. I'm the one who's good at harvesting.
Travis: Six.
Matt: Plus two, eight. You heal eight, Vax.
Travis: Eight.
Laura: Get inside, now.
Matt: So seven to Pike.
Laura: I'm going to fly over and try to help Percy, now that they're safe.
Taliesin: I got a 16.
Matt: 16, you healed?
Taliesin: No, 16 to investigate.
Matt: As you start peering through, you can see there's an intestinal tract that's covered in thorns. It's a very weird, fucked-up alien creature, based on any sort of anatomic understanding. As you pull back, you can find there's one rigid portion of the inside of its intestinal tract that is swollen and looks to have this weird black, pulsing mass that surrounds it, like it's infected perpetually.
Taliesin: I pull out my sword and cut it out.
Matt: As you pull it back, you can see there are actual vines and ivy that have begun to grow inside its abdomen. You tear back and pull it, and as soon as you cut back the rest of the muscle that's currently tensing it in, the muscle almost instinctually pulls back, all the tension lost, and it almost fires this staff-like entity out. It shoots outward, and you have to dodge to the side immediately. You see that it's strangely pristine amongst all the crimson and gore. The blood of this creature does not even touch its surface. A twisted series of clumped-together thorny vines that form this curvature at the top. A singular yellowish-green gem in the center that hovers, locked in place by no noticeable force. It's there, jutting out of the body of the creature.
Marisha: I run to Percy.
Taliesin: I walk to you. We're walking to the dragon, anyway. I hand it to you. Your majesty.
Laura: I land next to them. Oh my god. Let's get inside. (offscreen clatter)
Marisha: That's right!
Taliesin: Karma's a bitch!
Liam: Vorugal ain't shit!
Matt: You all rush into the inside of the mansion?
Marisha: I don't, immediately.
Taliesin: We're finishing up the harvesting, and I go to talk to Raishan really quickly.
Laura: I stay out, and I search more around Yenk.
Taliesin: I'm sending you to work on the dragon.
Marisha: I'm coming with you to have that conversation.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: I'm coming with you to have that conversation.
Sam: I will come, as well, to make sure Keyleth doesn't kill anyone.
Taliesin: Thank you. You've earned a conversation. We'll see you at home. You should get there quickly so there's no suspicion.
Sam: What's home?
Taliesin: We don't say it.
Matt: "Very well. I hope that perhaps this display of intent has quelled some of your worries. I'll see you at home, then." The form shifts down to that of Asum, closes the eyes for a second, and the form shifts as you see a sudden glyph appear beneath, and vanishes.
Taliesin: That was not a fight we were about to have.
Marisha: (sighs heavily) I silently go and start harvesting the white dragon.
Laura: Did you see how weak she was, compared to Vorugal?
Marisha: Let's just hope she stays that way. I start harvesting the white dragon as much as I can.
Liam: I'm going to find Larkin.
Sam: Send up a signal flare.
Laura: I take an empty potion bottle out and get some of Yenk's blood and put it in the cold.
Matt: Okay. As you're doing that, too, you're noticing that Yenk's body is rapidly decomposing. Its form is dissolving from the inside.
Marisha: I try as fast as I can-- wait, from who?
Taliesin: I'm going to run over and try and pull anything from Yenk.
Matt: I figure, for the fact that it's near midnight, we can begin next game working out the logistics of what you've managed to harvest with the rolls and such. We'll pick up from here next time. That was intense, guys. Well done.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Sam: Perfectly executed plan.
Taliesin: It really was. It actually was. How was this terrible?
Travis: That couldn't have gone any worse in the beginning. They hit each other maybe once, and then it was all on!
Matt: Actually, they did some pretty decent-- I think Yenk did close to 100 points of damage before you guys even engaged Vorugal.
Marisha: Can I see it?
Matt: (laughing) Can you see it?
Marisha: I really don't want to wait a week.
Matt: Sure. You can go ahead and have a look at your Spire of Conflux. You earned it.
Taliesin: Good work, girl.
Marisha: I didn't think I was going to get one, you guys!
Matt: Well, guys. Well done. You've now taken three of the five Chroma Conclave dragons, and with the death of Vorugal, pretty much are spearheading the final push to Thordak.
Liam: Is Thordak scared yet?
Matt: We'll find out. (chuckles) Well, guys. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful night. Thank you for those who stuck around for as late as this epic battle went. I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.
Travis: Glad Pike was here for the fight! (cheering)
Marisha: Sarenrae!
Matt: Divine Intervention! Punched Vorugal into the dirt, man.
Laura: Thank you, Loot Crate.
Matt: Thank you, Loot Crate for being awesome sponsors. Thank you, Critters for being such amazing people and for being so supportive of the community and the show and the story and making your own stories. We're so happy and so proud to have you with us. Be sure to check out the many charities that we support: 826LA, as well as all of our individual charities. You can look up the Critter's Guide to Critmas and see the list of them there. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons, or are a little late on the draw when shouting the phrase out, Travis Willingham. (laughs) Anyway, before we get into tonight's episode, let's go ahead and jump into our announcements. Let's see here, we've got a new game called Injustice 2 that just came out.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Yeah!
Laura: Wait a minute. What is this Injustice 2 you speak of?
Travis: Is that the shapes and pie-making game that you play in the kitchen bakery?
Marisha: It's like Cooking Mama.
Laura: I watched a video today of you and you fighting, which was pretty exciting.
Matt: Yeah, we have all the Flashes covered, I think.
Taliesin: All of the Flashes are on this show.
Laura: That's crazy.
Matt: So who do you guys play?
Taliesin: I play Barry Allen.
Liam: I play Reverse-Flash. What's his name?
Taliesin: Eobard Thawne.
Liam: Right.
Laura: I play Supergirl!
Travis: I play Tim Garrick.
Taliesin: Jay Garrick.
Travis: Jay Garrick. I wear a tin pail for a helmet.
Matt: It's pretty slick.
Travis: The one Flash I don't know, really.
Matt: Next Halloween, man. Just saying. I'd love a picture of you wearing that hat.
Taliesin: Oh my god!
Ashley: Yes, please.
Matt: Please. It'll be great. And I play Deadshot. Yeah, check it out, it looks really good. They had us all do really intense facial motion capture which is even funnier, considering that my character wears a mask the whole time.
Travis: Did they really make you do that?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Travis: With a mask?
Matt: Well, not with a mask on my face, but yeah.
Taliesin: That would've been even better.
Matt: I assume there'll be a DLC costume where he doesn't have a mask, or they just did it to fuck with me, which I respect either way.
Travis: They're in the booth, going (whispers) we're not getting any of this!
Taliesin: Don't tell him! Let it roll.
Travis: Just draw a dick-butt on his forehead; it's fine.
Laura: Those bright lights are headache-inducing, yeah.
Matt: So check it out. It's out now, it's fun! What I've seen of it looks actually really cool.
Taliesin: I've played a little; it's fun.
Matt: They got their RPG in my fighting game, and that's right up my alley. All right, also, because it's coming up real fast, reminder, MomoCon, May 25th to the 28th. MoMocon! Taliesin, Marisha, myself, and Brian W. Foster are going to be there for a Talks Machina panel, as well as other events throughout the weekend, so look forward to seeing you there in Atlanta, Georgia, weekend after this one. Also, I will be at A-Kon once again, June 8th to the 11th in Fort Worth, Texas. Come say hello to me there. And then, remember that Talks Machina is live on Tuesdays at 7PM Pacific Time here on Twitch and Alpha. The submission email has changed, so to submit your gif and/or fanart of the week, use submit@talksmachina.com. So that is submit, submit! One submit, not two, that's just my psychosis. Submit@talksmachina.com. Yes. Anything else anyone wants to talk about, are we good? Move on to the game for the night.
Laura: Oh! Farpoint came out. So if you have PlayStation Virtual Reality System, then you can get Farpoint, and I play Dr. Eva Tyson on it, and it's actually a really freaking cool game.
Travis: It's fun, you shoot things with a gun. Do you have to get the gun for it?
Laura: You shoot things with a gun, and it was a really cool script and stuff. I liked the story a lot.
Liam: That's not how guns work.
Taliesin: Are we talking about next week?
Marisha: Are we talking about next week?
Matt: Oh, yeah, we should say that, too.
Marisha: That's a big one.
Matt: That wasn't on the list. So yeah. So we're missing two cast members next week.
Travis: Guess who's not here.
Matt: What? That's terrible.
Ashley: Hey!
Matt: But given the circumstance, instead, we're going to have a non-numbered episode next week, instead it looks like we're going to throw in for a new, higher-level battle royale for those who will be here to see how some of these high-level abilities function.
Marisha: You won't be there to put my face in lava this time! I'll just have myself to do that.
Ashley: I know, you guys, I won't be there, so.
Travis: Will Friedle won the first one, she won the last one.
Laura: I've never done it.
Sam: I've never done it, either.
Laura: Oh no. And you're doing it as Tary?
Matt: It's up to you; you get to choose.
Marisha: Are you going to bring back Scanlan?
Sam: All right, Taryon's going to die in like five seconds. (laughter)
Taliesin: So if we loot Tary's body, do we get all of his stuff?
Matt: It's not in canon.
Taliesin: No, even not in canon, in the game.
Matt: Oh, if you go to his body after he's dead, you can grab any of his shit to use it.
Taliesin: You are a loot drop, oh my god.
Matt: As long as it's not attunement, you can use it.
Laura: Is the helmet attuned? It is, isn't it?
Matt: I believe it is, yes.
Sam: Probably, yeah.
Laura: Too bad. But we can just steal all of his jewels just for the sake of it.
Matt: There you go. In the alternate universe version, you are just decked out.
Sam: Do I get Doty in the fight?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Okay. That helps.
Matt: And you'll be leveled up to their level.
Sam: And I'll be leveled up to their level?
Matt: For the battle royale, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, we level up for that.
Matt: Anyway, that'll be next week. That pushes our hundredth episode to June 8th. And it looks like we're confirmed for June 1st for our next guest, I believe.
Sam: Yes. Yes, we are. We are confirmed for that. Are we announcing that?
Matt: Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Sam: Oh, well, yeah, on June 1st, our next guest, Jon Heder AKA Napoleon Dynamite, is going to come play with us and roll some dice. Yeah.
Marisha: My mother has never been so proud of me.
Laura: So, did we already say that because next week is a battle royale, that means our hundredth episode--
Matt: Is pushed to the 8th, yes.
Laura: Okay, you already said that? Was I busy rolling dice and talking?
Matt: You were. But thank you, Laura. Good looking out. I appreciate that. So yeah, I think that's all the major news, and given that, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello and welcome back, everybody. So last time where we left off, Vox Machina, upon working on their bakery, the Slayer's Cake in Whitestone, made a possible new hire who turned out to be a drow bounty hunter named K'rynn, who was sent here to acquire Taryon Darrington and bring him back home to the city of Deastok In Wildmount. You guys all, through a series of high-level magic scrying and transportation, managed to cut off this specific bounty hunter on the outskirts of the city, and in doing so made an agreement to not slay her where she stood, and instead possibly make a transaction down the road. You guys then made your way into the city of Deastok to the Darrington Estate and were led up into the study of Howaardt Darrington, father of Taryon, in which you all discussed the reasons of why he was brought back, the current financial state of the family, and the intent to resolve and remedy long-standing sins of the father, through you standing up and doing your family duty, from his perspective. We left off as you guys had just finished that conversation. You've exited his study and were about to go about your business. Coming off the tension of the conversation, you closed behind you with a clack the heavy wooden doors of Howaardt's study. There you have Bertholt, who's standing off to the side, the dragonborn servant of the Darrington family, waiting patiently, and you all at this moment are at your own disposal. What do you wish to do?
Sam: Just before we move  the names that Dad had told us about to maybe parlay with in the Myriad?
Laura: Korshad.
Sam: Korshad?
Matt: Korshad, yes.
Travis: And how much was the debt? It was 260,000?
Sam: 230,000!
Matt: 230,000 gold debt.
Sam: But wait, wasn't there some other name, the little--
Travis: Lydia!
Matt: Lydia was who you are to be betrothed to, and the location was the Grumpy Lily.
Marisha: I was questioning myself, I was like there was no way something was called the Grumpy Lily.
Matt: Had a stroke while taking notes in D&D. Grumpy Lily!
Laura: The Many is who we want to speak to.
Taliesin: Just as something that happened, during that whole family conversation I was scanning the room and the bookshelves for anything interesting, anything out of sorts, anything out of place.
Matt: Make a retroactive perception check.
Sam: A retroactive perception check!
Taliesin: I didn't want to-- yeah, I didn't see shit. I just rolled a three; that's nothing.
Matt: Rightly so!
Sam: Retrograde! You know they always say that retrograde perception is 20/20?
Matt: What?
Taliesin: I appreciate what you were going for there.
Sam: Anyway, I would love to ask Bertholt if he knows the location of my sister.
Matt: "Well, if you are looking for Maryanne, she's probably in her chambers."
Sam: All right, well, I mean I guess we can all walk to her room and knock on the door. It's a little weird, right?
Liam: You want to go talk to her and touch base with her first? You can introduce us to her after.
Sam: Sure. I'll lead them back downstairs to that main room that was all awful and terrible, right?
Matt: Well, it was just dark and cold and empty.
Sam: So I'll lead them down there. This was our playroom, maybe you should just wait here and I'll go talk to sis. I'll be right back.
Laura: All right.
Travis: Is there like furniture to sit on, or is it barren?
Matt: No, no. There's furniture, and a lot of the furniture here is really well made, dark woods, fine deep red and maroon fabrics. A lot of it has dust on it.
Taliesin: Plastic covers? No plastic covers?
Matt: No plastic covers. But some of the furniture here is for use and some of it is here just as part of the decor, and it's very easy to see which ones are which.
Laura: I'm definitely going to sit on the ones that are just for decor.
Matt: Okay, they're really uncomfortable.
Laura: Cool. Going to rub my butt all over it.
Matt: You leave a little butt-print in the dust. Perfect. At which point, Bertholt acknowledges that you guys will be staying. "Could I get anything for you? Perhaps teas, juice, water?"
Travis: What is this bullshit, no ale?
Laura: Do you have fermented juice?
Matt: "I'll fetch the wine." And he hobbles off to acquire some means of imbibement.
Travis: Should we pay him? We just found out he's dead fucking broke.
Laura: I'd rather not.
Travis: Okay. (laughter)
Matt: Okay. You make your way back to the second floor and off to the far western end of the estate, to what you recall being Maryanne's chambers. So as you enter her room, which has become her own study, as you recall last time seeing her, her room was becoming more and more of a functional office, and as you knock and push the door open like a familiar brother does, not wishing for any patience on her end, necessarily, you can see the interiors. The bed's there for function. Most if it is, I wouldn't say a replica, but it very much resembles the decor and mood of your father's study. You see her currently sitting at a desk in the corner. Her blonde hair is tied back in a tied braid that runs down her back. She wears a coat and pants and seems to be dressed a little formally or businesslike for being casually at home. You haven't really seen her dress like this before, at least not in a casual circumstance. As you glance over past the doorway she looks up from her papers and goes, "Brother!"
Sam: Hello, sister.
Matt: "Brother, what--" She closes the book. You can see she's been looking over ledgers and catalogues. Looks like she's been doing a fair amount of work here at the desk and stands up in a very formal way and begins to step towards you. "When have you arrived?"
Sam: Just today. Father kidnapped me and brought me home.
Matt: "Kidnapped?"
Sam: Well, I'm not a kid, but still works. Abducted. Abducted me and brought me home. Paid someone to do it.
Matt: "Right."
Sam: Yes. Anyway, it's good to see you. Your room is coming along quite nicely. It seems like you're running the show now, is that true?
Matt: "No, not quite, but the responsibilities have definitely been mounting. You look well. How have the wind-tossed roads of Exandria treated you this past year?"
Sam: Well, I have had many adventures and close calls, but I won't bore you with those details. It's been an interesting year abroad, and I would say I'm glad to be back, but for the abduction part and also the fact that I've now learned that we are destitute? Is that true?
Matt: "We're on the path to destitution, yes."
Sam: So it's true; he wasn't just trying to guilt me.
Matt: "Probably both, to be honest. We're in a relatively dire situation compared to our previous long-standing lifestyle choices. We're trying to fix this mess."
Sam: And what would have been your plan had I not arrived today?
Matt: "Well, you were part of the plan. We're trying to figure this out the best we can and given the circumstances, we feel this is probably one of the most viable and least dangerous or risky endeavors in which we can right the family's trajectory."
Sam: By marrying me to some lady I've never met?
Matt: "Oh, you're welcome to meet her. I've met her. I helped to arrange this."
Sam: What is she like?
Matt: "She's very nice. She's very pretty, a bit bookish, which once again would befit you rather well, but let's be honest. This is a political marriage. You do what you want. I mean, there isn't a politician or a lord of this land that hasn't in some way, shape, or form made their own life outside of the family." At that point, you noticed she gets a bit dark and seems to speak with this bit of sarcasm.
Sam: And father's businesses, are they being run the same way? With the same attention to detail?
Matt: "There's been no necessary change to the way business has been done. Other than the transition of some responsibilities, of course." And she gives a slight nod. She's getting a little uncomfortable as this conversation continues.
Sam: Listen, I'm sorry to pop in like this and challenge your judgment, but me marrying this person would solve our problems long-term? Somehow?
Matt: "Marrying into this family, the Truscan lot, would enable us the resources and connections to reacquire the deeds to our land, to reacquire the business elements that we've been in this unnecessary partnership with for some time, and would enable us to once again reclaim complete rulership of our family-controlled lands."
Sam: Do we not own anything anymore?
Matt: "It is a partnership that is quickly sliding into the behest of the Myriad."
Sam: So what is ours now? Anything? Our personal belongings? This home?
Matt: "We still own everything, in partnership. Own solely on our own? Some of the furniture."
Sam: And again, if I do this, what's to say we're not just going to drive up another debt again? Doesn't seem like father or you have been very good at keeping us in the black.
Matt: "I have only been recently brought into this unfortunate circumstance, brother. And you can trust in knowing that in my studies and my time spent here, working with father, being very clear, and very thorough with the mistakes he's made in the past, I will not be doomed to repeat them."
Sam: So you and he are two peas in a pod, yes?
Matt: "Well, he's certainly in need of retiring based on the stress he's put upon himself. It would not be long until I will take over the responsibilities."
Sam: Well, I may poke around and see if there's another way I could help. But before I do, is this fun for you? Do you like running this business, or almost running it?
Matt: "It's certainly a better challenge than many other daughters of lords are given in their time."
Sam: Do you have any friends?
Matt: "Friends come, when the money and power's in place. You know this."
Sam: I do.
Matt: "It's the way the land works."
Sam: Well, I'll leave you to your work, and-- love the decorations. I'm considering the offer and I'll have an answer for you by tomorrow morning.
Matt: "Wonderful." As you begin to make any sort of exit, she catches you and goes, "Brother, your arrival here is a great boon to us. You have the power to change the fate of this family. Consider the respect you have for the people who have worked their entire lives to provide for you what you have been given. Mother and Father sacrificed so much for us. Consider weighing one's selfish interest versus the importance of a bloodline. That is all I ask."
Sam: All right. I'll consider it. With all my intellect.
Matt: "Well, it's good to see you." She steps forward and gives you a half-hug. It's like--
Sam: A pat. The back pat. Good day.
Matt: "Good day." She straightens her coat and sits back behind her desk and waits for you to leave.
Sam: All right. I'll shimmy out. (sighs) All right, I'll rejoin my friends downstairs. Well--
Laura: How did it go?
Liam: Well, yourself.
Sam: As expected. Things are about the same between me and Maryanne.
Laura: Is she still a raging bitch?
Sam: No, she's not raging.
Ashley: I just think it's rather rude that she doesn't want to come down here and meet us.
Sam: She has her work and her--
Liam: Oh, she's not coming down?
Sam: No.
Liam: That's weird.
Sam: I mean, I don't know, she's busy. I guess.
Liam: Okay.
Sam: They're not guest people. They're not dinner party family.
Liam: We picked up on that.
Laura: Not even for people who could help them with their name?
Marisha: Did you mention us or anything else?
Sam: Nope. It didn't come up.
Liam: Did they have any idea what a heavy hitter you are now? The type of people you roll with?
Sam: They said, how have I been? But they don't really give a shit either way.
Marisha: So you didn't even offer up the information?
Sam: If they are not interested in me, why should I be interested in them knowing about me?
Laura: That's a very good point.
Liam: Let's back it up. What are you thinking? Where's your head at? How can we help you?
Sam: I don't know what to do. There's this woman; she's apparently nice and I could go for it and marry her, and then it seems like all my family problems would be okay.
Ashley: Forever?
Marisha: There's no such thing as family problems being okay for forever.
Travis: Really?
Sam: I don't know. I'm sort of curious about talking to the people who are in this contract with my father and seeing if there's any way to wiggle out of it a little bit, but I don't know how to solve everything right now. I also don't know-- I feel a duty, a responsibility to this family, because they are my family.
Marisha: Grog!
Travis: You feel a doodie? The privy is over there! Or over there! Or the front yard beckons.
Taliesin: He may have opened a bottle of wine.
Travis: I'm lost for the rest of this conversation.
Laura: No, we're not drunk, we may have just had a little bit of wine, just a small amount.
Travis: I carved my name into the floor.
Sam: Part of me wants to-- oh god. Part of me wants to turn around and go back with you to Whitestone and forget that the Darringtons exist, but I don't think I can't do that. I am a Darrington and I owe it at least to my name to try and fix what I can.
Laura: That's your plan?
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Don't sacrifice your entire life for this, though.
Sam: Well, I'll try not to, but it seems like a plan B at this point.
Liam: Also, you had no prior knowledge to your family's connection to the mob?
Sam: No? It's way cooler than I thought my family ever was. I knew my dad did shady business with lots of shady characters but I never knew-- I assumed he paid off people. I assumed he had friends in high places and people who you'd have to bribe to turn the other cheek, but I never knew that he was in business with them, owing our whole existence to these terrible people, and I don't know what to make of that
Liam: T, I think we're all prepared to help you do anything you want to do, but are you sure you want to help perpetuate the family business?
Sam: Definitely not. Listen, I think there's two steps to this: there's the short term and the long term. We have to solve this short-term need really quickly. Not this whole 230,000-dollar-- I mean -gold debt. It's a Whitestone term, I mean a Wildmount. Oh my god. My phone rang! I'm confused! Anyway, listen, couple drinks before-- no. We have a short-term problem that we can maybe go alleviate a bit if we go talk to these folk at the Laughing Ninny or whatever it's called. The Grumpy Lily.
Liam: I like the Laughing Ninny. I kinda want to go there instead.
Taliesin: It's a stand-up comedy club. (laughter)
Sam: And then there's a long-term problem which I'll have to solve on another day. There's a long- term problem that my family is awful and needs to be stopped at all costs, and that's something that I'll have to deal with tomorrow.
Laura: Do the Truscans, that's who you are being married into potentially, do they have a son?
Taliesin: That doesn't help! That's almost beside the point!
Sam: You're talking about marrying the sister? Yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, that's still--
Laura: I guess it's not the same, is it?
Taliesin: No! Actually, it's unfortunately the opposite.
Sam: You're royalty. You know this!
Laura: Of course, I know everything about royalty.
Sam: Little royal girl.
Marisha: What exactly is your duty that you are feeling inclined towards? Damn it, Grog!
Taliesin: Lilah? Is it Lilah?
All: Lydia.
Taliesin: Perhaps we should talk to this Lydia as well, because she is obviously in a position of being told what she is going to do with herself.
Marisha: Yeah! Maybe she's also a badass!
Liam: At the very least, we should meet all the chess pieces on the board, right?
Sam: I mean, she lives in another part of the kingdom, right, Matthew Mercer?
Marisha: That's not a problem.
Sam: Oh yes, that's true. But there's the in-town people we can meet first.
Laura: Sure. Let's talk to the mob!
Sam: Yes, of course! You'll come with me? Because I can't talk to the mob by myself.
Laura: Tary, of course we will!
Travis: Wait, when you said we need to stop your family at all costs, are you talking about killing them?
Sam: No, I'm not talking about killing them.
Marisha: Yeah, but Grog does bring up a point that I was trying to make before he started laughing when I said "duty." (giggles) But what, are you committed to keeping your family around? You said you were compelled and you felt like you had a duty but then you immediately started talking about--
Taliesin: Stop it, Travis! God, I can't--
Marisha: Tearing your family apart? And stopping them?
Sam: My family is pretty bad, I've learned. But I've also learned from young Trickfoot that even a rotten family is worth trying to save. And I admire the path that she took with her family, and I would like to at least try to push mine in the right direction and try to make our name a little less shitty.
Liam: That is a pretty big matzo ball, my friend.
Sam: Well, that's why that's long term. In the short term, I just want to get them safe.
Marisha: If there's one thing I understand, it's giving your life to a cause.
Sam: I don't want to die, if that's what you're saying.
Marisha: No.
Sam: Dedicating.
Marisha: Dedicating.
Sam: Thank you.
Marisha: Time is a gift, I would say.
Sam: Sure.
Marisha: So dedicating that gift is, it's a big thing, but I hope you believe in it.
Sam: I don't believe in them, but I believe in the cause right now, and we'll see how far that takes us.
Marisha: We believe in you.
Sam: You guys.
Travis: Can you describe to me this duty?
Marisha: You don't care!
Travis: I think I do now. Is it real hard?
Sam: It's a little more nebulous than that, Grog.
Taliesin: We can pass on this for now.
Travis: Adjectives are not my strong suit, so.
Laura: You know what an adjective is! That's impressive.
Travis: Yeah. No, I got it one time at this tavern. I had it for two nights. It just itched everywhere.
Sam: Listen. When you see my duty, you'll know.
Travis: Copy that.
Liam: It's loose. This duty is loose.
Laura: Should we go to the Grumpy Lily, then?
Taliesin: Please.
Laura: This is going so well.
Matt: As you're exiting the house and Berthold's opening the door, you hear some heavy creaking from the stair that leads down to the main area, and you watch as an older woman in her early fifties or so with her mid-length, curly brown hair in shades of gray, green eyes behind a small set of reading spectacles, stoic of face, wearing what looks to be some sort of a finely crafted silk robe, clutching a book under her arm, comes down the steps and looks down and goes, "Taryon?"
Sam: Mama?
Matt: "Taryon, my boy!" And she sets the book down and walks up, puts her hands out as she says, "Oh," takes you at the sides of the face and pulls you in for (kisses). "Oh, terribly sorry. I didn't realize that we had guests."
Sam: Oh, yes, these are my allies and my friends. This is the team known as Vox Machina. They are a fearless band of adventurers and they have taken me in as their own.
Matt: "Look at you, so rugged!"
Sam: Well. Yes, I am, a bit!
Matt: "So you've had some adventures with my boy, have you?"
All: We have.
Matt: "That's wonderful. Have you spoken with your father?"
Sam: Yes, I've spoken to Father, and Sister, and it's good to know they're healthy. And it's lovely to see you, as well. Have you been happy at all, this last year?
Matt: "I--" And she reaches back and takes the book off the step and goes, "I've been making my way through your library."
Sam: Oh! Oh, my books, in my room.
Matt: "Yes! Well, I've had a lot of time to myself. Been a bit under the weather for some time, and these have kept me fine company."
Sam: Oh. That's lovely. I hope you've enjoyed them as much as I did. What's your favorite one?
Matt: "Well, not this piece of trash." And she sets it down. "There's one. What was it called? The River's Dawn. It was a brilliant--"
Sam: Before the River's Dawn, yes.
Matt: "Before the River's Dawn! That one, yes. It was a continuation of the creation myth of Wildmount, but it turned into the spirits of the gods, these two fauns, and they fell in love but could not be together because the dawn had to rise and the sun would shine. It was very, very beautiful!"
Sam: Yes, yes! No it was, but also heartbreaking at the same time.
Matt: "Very much so. It reminded me of you."
Sam: Yes. That's one of my favorites, as well.
Matt: "Well. I didn't break the binding too much, I hope."
Sam: I'll fix it if you did. It's all right.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: Well, that's wonderful to hear. I'm glad you've been entertaining yourself. I know living with Papa can be very hard, and it's been very hard on you all these years.
Matt: "If you would excuse us for just a moment, please. Just a few moments." And she points towards the door.
Sam: I told you they were like this.
Travis: Yeah, no, we're going out the front door. Front yard.
Marisha: Bottle of wine!
Matt: Berthold is leading you out of the main area, out the front door.
Travis: Yeah, front door!
Laura: Out the house, like get out?
Matt: You guys were on your way out.
Sam: Just wait on the fucking porch!
Liam: We got it.
Laura: Fine.
Matt: As soon as she has some privacy with you, she goes, "My boy, if you could indulge me in some strange honesty, I'm rather intrigued at this idea. I don't wish to undermine anything that we've built as a family. I've lived a privileged life for a very long time, far longer than you and your sister have. I've lived within this house, removed from the world. I do as responsibility asks of me, my wedded duties as both a wife and a mother, and I do so without complaint. I have always seen you fight these same circumstances bravely, and I find vicarious joy in your escape from this place this past year. These books are a reminder of that same bravery. I know Howaardt has said many things, and he may be right. But there's a little part of me that welcomes a little change in scenery and lifestyle. Maybe that's what the family needs. I don't know. Perhaps I'm foolhardy. I know not."
Sam: No, you're right to think this way. This year has been eye-opening for me, and I know that you care for Papa, and you are a diligent and faithful wife. But I know how hard it must have been to live this life for so many years and I wonder what it would be like if you hadn't been with him, what kind of person you would be.
Matt: "Looking at you, looking at your sister, I wouldn't change it for the world."
Sam: Well, things are going to have to change at some point, right?
Matt: "One way or another. I just-- (sighs) I just want you to make choices for yourself. I want you to do what you think is right, that you could live with. Duty and blood is one thing, but... Anyway, I'm talking out of turn."
Sam: No. Thank you. Thank you for that.
Matt: "Could you not tell Howaardt we've had this conversation?"
Sam: Mum's the word. All right. I'll be back, and maybe we'll have time to talk more books later.
Matt: "I would like that very much."
Sam: Good evening.
Matt: "Good evening." As you leave, she's like, "Oh! The other one I was trying to remember was The Mountain Range of Gold. It was a wonderful three-part series--"
Sam: When you think he's dead, but he's not, and he comes back?
Matt: "Well, the second book, you get halfway through it before he even turns and reveals himself!"
Sam: I know! Well, you never see the body in the first one, so that should have been a tip-off.
Matt: "And then the white robes and everything! His renewed power, it's incredible! Anyway, I'm sorry, you have your friends waiting on you. Good night, Taryon."
Sam: Yes.
Liam: I want to adopt her.
Marisha: She's awesome!
Matt: So as you step out to greet the rest of your friends?
Sam: All right, let's go to the Jumping Jimmy, or whatever it's called.
Laura: How's your mother?
Sam: She's better. I mean, she's had a tough time. That was the longest conversation I've had with her in many years.
Laura: Wow.
Ashley: She said she's under the weather. What's wrong?
Sam: I think everybody's super stressed out and heartsick about everything that's happening, and living under a tyrant of a father is not healthy. You should have seen me when I lived here. I was not nearly as dashing or as charming as I am now. It took me spreading my wings and flying before I found my sense of humor. My hair looks better, my eyes look better.
Marisha: I thought you said that was because of the aloe vera.
Sam: Well, yes. We didn't have any at home.
Marisha: Right, yeah. Salt air is better for you.
Sam: I mean, life needs aloe to live. Is something I always say.
Taliesin: That's true.
Liam: I've heard you say that two or three times.
Sam: Moisturizing products in general. Life needs moisturizing products to live.
Taliesin: Life needs moisture to live.
Ashley: I know my beauty regimen's changed.
Marisha: Life needs moisture to live. It's way smarter-sounding.
Taliesin: All right, gauntlet dropped.
Laura: All right, to the Laughing Ninny it is.
Matt: All right. Who's leading this charge? Probably you, Taryon.
Sam: I know the place.
Liam: You are in charge while we're here.
Matt: You've never been to this place. You've heard of it, but you'd never be seen dead in a place like this before. You lead your way in. At this point, because when you arrived the sun was still in the sky, but it was deep in the sky, so by now it's post-dusk. You now see the massive stone and wood structures of Deastok are dark against the ever-dark sky with the windows now aglow, this warm yellows and orange of the candle and lantern-lit interiors. You can see there are hanging lanterns that are put out there, and you can see a number of individuals who seem to work for the city, who go and place these lanterns up in each of these poles, are now finishing their job and are returning to the evening. Following these lamps, along the street, the cobblestones are still really well kept for as old as this town seems to be. For a city that isn't a major metropolis within a kingdom, and what your experience has been in Tal'Dorei, a fair amount of money still makes it way through this city. Eventually, you find your way fairly far north into the city until you come across the exterior of the Grumpy Lily. Asking a few questions to guide you to which building it is, it's much smaller than you expected. You see what appears to be a single-story pub with one window, one door, no more than maybe 30 feet on any given side. It is lit from the inside, though it's dimly lit. As you approach and push past the somewhat ajar entryway, you see before you what appears to be three tables. Three singular, stained, brown tables. One lone patron sits at the center table, an elderly man inspecting a small, clay sculpture that he's enraptured by, and a single barkeep to your right that seems to notice your entry. A healthy, pale woman of brunette hair in her forties, dressed in a simple gray blouse. As soon as you enter and take in the atmosphere, she goes, "Slow day, folks! Happy to have the business! What can I get you?"
Liam: Jeez, Grog, I don't even know if you're going to fit in here.
Travis: Yeah, it's really tiny.
Matt: Your head does reach the ceiling.
Travis: Shit.
Laura: Just dive in then?
Sam: Should we get anything to drink first? Or just dive in?
Travis: Yeah, it's like how you have to buy something to use the restroom.
Marisha: Do you have a shiraz? I was just wondering if you had any imports. Do you have a red wine?
Matt: "Yes! That I can get for you, dear. Don't worry. Red wine we can do definitely." She walks over and slams her hand on the side of the bar and what you thought was once the patron now appears to be the one barman there. "Wait! What! Oh. I missed the conversation."
Travis: Oh the guy with the sculpture?
Matt: Yeah. "Red wine, for our guests." "Oh." He stands up and begrudgingly walks over. You see his back is hunched forward and he's (pained grunting). Leaves the room for a second. "Well, sit down, find a place wherever you like."
Sam: Put two tables together, I guess?
Laura: All three, really.
Marisha: Let's just take them all.
Travis: Wait, this is the meeting place of a dark group, right? A shady group? Shouldn't we check this area for anything shady?
Taliesin: Is there shade in this establishment?
Matt: It's dimly lit, so there's plenty of shadows.
Liam: It's a five-by-five square. Do we see anything amiss? Oh, that's terrible. 24.
Matt: Nothing seems amiss. It seems like a shitty pub. It's the definition of a poorly attended dive.
Laura: Does it look like there's any seams in the ground that would be a trapdoor or anything?
Matt: You can make an investigation check if you want to.
Laura: 17.
Matt: You begin to look around the floor and keep perspective around the area. No. You see some stains, you see some crumbs, and at one point you look over in the corner and you see what appears to be a piece of stale bread that's been left under one of the tables and there are three rats currently eating it. As soon as you lean in, they all stop and look at you and scatter.
Laura: Oh, you can keep going.
Taliesin: Could be worse. They could not be afraid of you.
Laura: That's true.
Matt: (laughs) They just give you the fuck-you look and keep eating their bread.
Taliesin: That's when you know you've really found the right bar. The rats were like: "We reserved this table two weeks ago. You have to make a phone call."
Matt: The elderly barman walks in now and he's got two bottles of red wine and he's shuffling. (grunts, clinks) "I'll get your cups." Turns around and starts shuffling back.
Laura: (laughing) Do you need any help?
Marisha: I mean we have-- Oh, it's fine.
Taliesin: Just let it happen.
Sam: Okay. Who do you think we proposition here? The old man?
Liam: That guy.
Sam: That guy? Really? What makes you say that?
Taliesin: Shifty eyes.
Liam: Shifty yeah, may be an act, even.
Sam: He's just old I thought. No?
Laura: Nobody's just old.
Liam: He's many things.
Marisha: That's true, look at Pike's grandpa.
Liam: Look at Pike.
Ashley: Look at me.
Liam: How old are you, again?
Ashley: 142.
Liam: I said goddamn.
Sam: Is that true?
Ashley: No.
Sam: Oh. (laughter)
Sam: Oh. Well, because you could be.
Ashley: I forgot my birthday. I don't know how old I am.
Sam: Is it in the hundreds?
Ashley: No. I think it's in the 30s.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Ashley: Right?
Matt: Whatever you want.
Ashley: Yeah.
Liam: You ain't no baby.
Matt: The gentleman shuffles back now with a bunch of cups. His hands wrung through all the various handles. (grunts, clicks)
Laura: Impressive.
Matt: (grunts) "Two gold for both bottles."
Laura: I give him two gold.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: You're welcome.
Sam: In my earring, I say to Vex  I'm clamming up, you do it.
Laura: Sir?
Matt: You see him walking and he goes like (sighs).
Laura: On your way to the back, could you tell the Many we'd like to speak to them?
Matt: He slowly turns his head over to the bartender, the woman. "What was that?"
Laura: Oh, just a conversation with the Many.
Matt: "What about them?"
Liam: I dip my thumb into some wine and I use thieves' cant and write "discuss" in wine on the bar.
Matt: (click) She gives a click noise to the old man, who goes (groan, thump) Are you going to take your bottles or what?
Laura: No, yeah, we'll definitely keep those.
Matt: "All right, pick them up. Follow me."
Taliesin: Oh, we're going to get to see the real bar.
Matt: He turns around and shuffles out. It's like following a bad, slow NPC in World of Warcraft. You're like, just go fucking faster! His pace is terrible. Yeah, it's awful.
Laura: Running ahead, turning around.
Matt: Exactly, just waiting.
Travis: Over here, adventurer!
Matt: Eventually, he takes you out of the small pub, past the unused kitchen, which has another series of stale bread clumps on the side, down to what looks to be a broom closet. He gets there to the edge of the broom closet and pulls out a key ring.
Laura: I want to pay attention to what key he's taking.
Marisha: Can I take the bread crumbs from the corner and throw it down so the rats could have it?
Matt: Sure. So you walk over to the kitchen and grab some of the bread crumbs and throw them down on the ground and you wait there, because there's no rats present. And you're like, bread crumbs. They scatter a little further out. You turn around and the minute you turn, in the air you hear (skittering) and look over, and there's like seven rats that just scurried out of the shadows and are just going at these crumbs immediately.
Travis: I kill all of them.
Laura: Sploosh!
Liam: I nudge my sister and say, all mine.
Laura: Yes. That she is.
Matt: He pulls one key and unlocks the small closet. You paid attention? (creak) Opens this rickety wooden door, and goes (grunt) and walks past, and he's behind the door, expectantly waiting. You guys glance into the space, and you can see there's what looks to be a low torchlight about every ten feet down a wooden stairway that descends about 30, 40 feet.
Liam: Traps, people hiding, anything that seems out of place or dangerous.
Matt: Traps, or people hiding?
Liam: Traps.
Laura: I'll look for people hiding.
Matt: Perception check, investigation check.
Laura: 24.
Liam: 24.
Marisha: Twinsies!
Ashley: Twinsies!
Matt: Look at that. That's disgusting. All right, so you guys make your way down. No traps in the stair descent, but you make your way to the bottom of the stairs without issue. You don't see anything necessarily fishy. You do see these torches have been burning for a little bit, a couple hours, and are probably needing to be re-upped pretty soon. You guys eventually make your way down, and as soon as the last of you-- who's following up the rear in this, by the way? What's the marching order?
Sam: I'll go toward the front with the twins?
Matt: The hallway here is about big enough for you to go single file.
Laura: Okay. You'll hang behind me, Tary?
Ashley: I'm in front of Grog.
Marisha: Yeah, I'll hang with Grog and Pike.
Taliesin: I'm in the center, as well.
Travis: I'm in the back.
Matt: Okay, so Grog's in the very back. Keyleth, Percy.
Laura: Pike is with Grog.
Matt: Yeah, Pike's with Grog. So we'll say, Grog in the back, then Pike, then Keyleth, then Percy, then Taryon?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: And Vex and Vax. And you have Trinket in your necklace, I assume? Okay. All right, so you guys descend down the stairway. As soon as, Grog, you make your way in, it's tiny. You have to (straining) squeeze in and duck low and even just walking through the pathway, your shoulders are rubbing against the sides of the wall, and your head occasionally (bang, bang).
Laura: It's like you in Japan, baby!
Travis: I know. Taking a shower, I broke like two shower heads. Just turning around, I was like (crash).
Liam: The beds, was that like lying down on a saltine for you?
Travis: Oh yeah. My heels were just over like the--
Laura: We went into McDonald's and his head hit the ceiling!
Matt: You are a kaiju!
Ashley: A kaiju from the deep! A level seven!
Marisha: Okay, wait, before we go any further.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Wait.
Travis: Oh my god. Holy shit. Before we go any further, wait.
Marisha: Do I have to be doing a short rest to do the Inspiring Leader thing?
Matt: It's ten minutes, it takes to do.
Marisha: Oh, never mind.
Laura: Well, no, we could stand here for ten minutes!
Travis: Yeah, no, please. Fucking say some words!
Marisha: I'm new to the being an inspiring leader thing.
Matt: Yeah, it's ten minutes, before you know you're going to go into something, you stop and do this.
Marisha: I should've done that at the bar.
Liam: Wouldn't that be cool if you were just pep-talking us all the way down here?
Sam: Start it now.
Laura: Yeah, start it now! Just do it while we're walking!
Marisha: Okay, okay. As we walk I'll be like  You know what, guys? I've had a lot of time to think over the year that we've been away--
Matt: The door closes behind Grog and you hear it lock.
Marisha: And I feel like we've grown so much as people, and you guys are family. You're a family to me. And I go on for a while. Do you guys remember that time in Stillben? When we very first met, and we all didn't really like each other, and Grog, I don't think you understood me for a while.
Travis: Still don't.
Marisha: Yeah, that's fine. That's fair. Hey Grog, do you remember that one time--
Matt: This is great, by the way, because at the bottom of the stairs it only goes for about 15 more feet before there's a door. There's a man on a stool who's just sitting there going--
Liam: She'll just be another minute.
Travis: I'm about to find out what the inside of a Bag of Holding feels like, I swear.
Matt: He's not stopping you.
Marisha: Do you remember that time-- I think it was the first time I made you laugh, and I turned into an earth elemental, and then pretended to do an "I'm going down the stairs" thing through the floor?
Travis: Oh yeah!
Marisha: Yeah, I just remembered that the other day, and I just love you guys so much, you know?
Taliesin: I don't feel included in this.
Marisha: Yeah, I don't think you were around yet. But I love you so much!
Taliesin: Okay, now I feel better. That's all.
Sam: Any change in our bodies or anything?
Liam: She's going for ten in-game, real-time minutes.
Matt: As you guys are all in the hallway, Grog at the back, you can't move forward, because everyone's stopped, and you're just like-- (groan) All of you who wish to can take 17 temporary hit points. That's by the inspiring leader feat.
Marisha: Oh yeah, you want to mock until you realize you get your hit points!
Matt: It is your choice as to whether or not you felt inspired by that and take them.
Marisha: And I love you guys. I love you guys so much.
Matt: Grog's too uncomfortable to take them.
Travis: No, I just start weeping silently in the back.
Liam: I mean, let's be honest, he wouldn't even feel the difference.
Matt: That's true, yeah. That's what Grog needs, is temporary hit points.
Liam: Grog would just go (sneezes).
Marisha: Not showing your sensitivity?
Laura: Thanks. Thanks, Keyleth. That felt good. That was a nice trip down memory lane.
Ashley: I feel inspired.
Laura: Oh, hey! How's it going there?
Matt: You see this guy, he's tough and surly, looks like a balding man who's just like made of muscle and anger. He's sitting there with one eye open, one a little squinted, he's just--
Laura: Do you feel inspired? No.
Liam: Not the warm and fuzzy type, are you?
Matt: He doesn't seem to respond. You do hear like a series of muffled voices and what sounds like a faint beat of some kind from the other side of the wall, just muffled.
Taliesin: Is the password, "I am what I am," not sure? Too strange a reference; never mind.
Matt: He begins to reach over for what looks to be a small lever that's hidden on the side.
Laura: We're here to speak to the Many.
Matt: Stops. (grunts)
Sam: We're in.
Laura: We're going to just go on in, then.
Sam: That word just gets us in.
Matt: So. As you guys enter this doorway, as it pushes open, you're immediately hit with a wall of voices and laughter and conversation, interweaving in multiple languages. This is far more lively than you expected it would be, it's a large tavern hall. It's almost two stories tall, but it's open. There's a central, circular chandelier that hangs over with what looks to be flickering candles in a circle around it. You can see elements of what are almost like a second floor, but it's more like a slight balcony outcropping. You don't see any doorways, it's just a level platform above, and there before you, you see what has to be three or four dozen people scattered across a number of tables, all in various forms of dress and many of them are drinking, some of them are playing games of chance, some of them are in deep conversation. You can see, the music-- though this is a bad example, but it's what I have-- it's not a full band, per se. It looks like there's a set of three percussionists in the far corner that are all in the process of weaving this rhythmic beat that shifts and changes. Some of them are on more of a hand drum, some of them are more small percussion instruments. It's interesting. It's not the usual bar atmosphere you're used to. It has almost a weird--
Sam: Would you say more like Blue Man Group or more like a subway bucket drummer?
Matt: I'd say it's in between the two, actually. Take a little Blue Man Group and a little bit of subway bucket drummer. It's right in between there. You guys step into the chamber and take in the atmosphere a bit. Whether that be with smiles, awe, or confusion and care.
Taliesin: That's exactly what I said, the real bar.
Ashley: I like this.
Liam: This is like old times.
Matt: As soon as you begin having this conversation and taking in the atmosphere, one of four bar hands sees you approach. You see a jagged smile of a hairless man with ruddy skin that immediately comes up to you. "Aye, friends! New faces are few and far between here in Deastok. Welcome to our little slice of the family. What can I get you?"
Sam: Well, we brought bottles. That's rude, isn't it?
Laura: The good stuff is down here.
Matt: "I don't know where you got that shit but put that away. We'll get you right fucked up, eh?"
Marisha: Do you have a shiraz?
Matt: "I'll see what I can muster."
Marisha: I like these people!
Matt: "Slim pickings for room here. It's a bit early in the evening. That's when it's the busiest. Just find some space, sit down. Folks don't want you to sit by them? Don't fucking sit by them."
Laura: Thank you. Do we see room for a large group?
Matt: You see two tables that have room for half of a large group.
Laura: All right. Split up?
Sam: Why don't we ask them nicely if they would like to move?
Laura: No, let's not do that.
Travis: Yeah, no. You do that. Go by yourself.
Sam: No?
Taliesin: No. This is special.
Travis: How about the talkers go to one table?
Marisha: And then the defenders go to another in case shit goes bad. I like that.
Travis: The Defenders' Table. Yeah, so I'm going to the talkers' table.
Laura: Yeah, obviously.
Marisha: Vex, Tary, I feel like you guys are good talkers.
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: I'll join you.
Liam: I'm actually going to wander the room.
Marisha: I'll sit with Grog and Pike.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah, Shiraz time.
Laura: All right.
Sam: What's our play here? Do we just keep saying the word "many" as many times as we can and see how far it goes?
Laura: This is about as in as we get with the Many.
Sam: This is it? So now we ask for her by name? Or him by name? Korshad?
Laura: Yeah. He or she may not reveal themselves too quickly.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: We could buy Korshad a drink.
Laura: That is a beautiful idea.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: Care of one Taryon Darrington.
Sam: Of course. I have just enough for a nice drink.
Laura: Oh, we'll cover the drink, darling. Party funds cover the drink. It's just in your name.
Sam: Oh. Oh, okay. All right. All right. I'm slow to catch on sometimes.
Laura: Can we grab a barmaid?
Matt: You split between the two tables. One of the tables appears to be three guys who are in a card game. As soon as you sit down they (grunts) and then keep talking amongst themselves more about taking bets, bluffing each other, giving shit about their home lives, stuff like that. The other table has four quiet individuals that are, look to be elvish lineage. Either half-elf or full elf; it's hard to tell. They're wearing these hoods that show the ears from underneath but then seem to block a lot of the features of their face and guard a lot of the forehead. This silk hood that drips down past the nose on the sides.
Laura: Do we recognize any semblance of that garb?
Matt: Make a history check.
Sam: History check.
Laura: Well, my history is shit, but 19.
Matt: 19. You haven't seen this kind of dress, but you've heard of it. It seems to be of Wildmount but the eastern side of Wildmount, not a part of the Dwendalian Empire. This more stems from Zorhaus, which is the other kingdom on the continent. It's actually in a tense existence along the border of the Dwendalian Empire.
Laura: You said it was to the east?
Matt: Zorhaus, I'm pretty sure that's what it's called.
Laura: It is now.
Matt: It is! It's whatever it's called in the campaign guide.
Laura: Oh! Oh man, that's right. Now you have to stick to what you wrote. That's crazy.
Matt: I know, I'll just have to look it up again. But anyway. As soon as you sit down at the table the four individuals look at each other and then get up from the table and then walk off to find another place.
Laura: Maybe some of us don't smell very good in this group. I'm not one of them, though. I smell amazing.
Liam: I smell fucking fantastic, and I'm over there. I am going to laze about the musicians and listen to the musicians and wait for them to finish a set.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I guess all of us can sit at the table because of the people--
Matt: All of you guys can sit at the table now that you've forced them off their own space. The guys playing the card game seemed to pay no mind. As you sit around the table, the barhand that met you here approaches and once more goes, "All right, looks like you've found a place to sit, what can I get you? Got you that shiraz you were asking for, eh." He goes ahead and he pulls up what looks to be a dark green bottle, already uncorked and he brings over a hefty metallic goblet or tankard and then pours it in there. It appears to be something akin to a shiraz, I suppose. Fills it to the top, slides it forward. "All right. Drinks for anyone else, eh?"
Travis: Yeah, you got any pies or meat or both?
Taliesin: To drink.
Travis: Do they not have food?
Laura: No, probably.
Matt: "I can get you a meat pie, if that's what you're asking. I don't recommend you drink it, though you could probably squeeze water from a stone, so wouldn't surprise me if you could."
Travis: Yeah, meat pie and an ale, please.
Matt: "All right, coming on up. Anyone else?"
Laura: Whiskey?
Taliesin: Same.
Matt: "It can be done. So whiskey. And you, little one?"
Ashley: Well, you said you have things that will fuck you up right, so what would that be considered?
Matt: "Oh, I mean no offense, lady, but you're a bit small-sized--"
All: Whoa!
Matt: "I mean that respectfully! Look, I'm just looking out for my patrons here. I don't want to go ahead and send someone to the local temple."
Laura: She can drink most people under the table.
Ashley: Bring it!
Matt: "All right. I'll take your word for it, then."
Sam: I'll have another shiraz.
Matt: "Another shiraz."
Liam: Over the earring  Pickle, will you get me one of those, as well, and don't drink it before I come back?
Ashley: As a matter of fact, I want two of whatever that is.
Matt: "All right, coming up." And he leaves the table.
Taliesin: Did you order the drink for when he comes back?
Sam: Oh the other drink? Oh fuck. Wait, before he goes, pardon me. I have one more order to make. I would like to buy a drink for Korshad, courtesy of Taryon Darrington. And I'll slip him a gold piece.
Travis: I thought you were about to shake his hand with two fingers.
Sam: There is a coin between the two fingers.
Matt: "Korshad, you say?"
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: I nudge him under the table.
Matt: "You want what he likes, it's going to cost you more than that."
Laura: What does he like?
Sam: Whatever it is, here is another four and keep another one for yourself.
Matt: "Thank you very much. That'll put you up to yours, though. We will go ahead and settle your bills at the end of the drinks. But all right, Korshad it is."
Taliesin: What table did the bartender look at when he said that?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Oh, I was planning on totally watching that, too.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's a safe 13.
Laura: Should I roll, too?
Matt: Well, you said you were looking, too, so roll a perception, yeah.
Laura: Well yeah, okay. 30.
Matt: 30, okay. You gather the direction that he glanced. It was a cursory look, more to see if the individual in question was still in the room or not. But you got the direction of it, and you know exactly where he was looking-- three tables and that way there. He leaves for a bit, and the laughter is still rising and falling throughout the room. The musicians in the corner, which are two younger human boys and what appears to be a female goliath, who has the heavier drum in the center, who is like the mid-piece, the big (heavy drum noises). The two guys, one of them has a small set of lap drums, (light drum noises) the faster beats. And the guy to the left of her-- they could be brothers; you're not too sure, their features are similar but different enough, the ages seem off. The guy on the left has a series of small wooden blocks and what looks to be some sort of contraption that has three or four different small percussion instruments that are all fixed to it and so he is leaping between them all. For being just percussion, that variety is still making a cool melody. You're still able to find certain notes and certain blends where it still is a very different and unique atmosphere. They manage to bring to this crescendo the piece that you entered on, and it finishes. There is no real-- there is occasionally a couple of claps here and most everyone is busy about their own shit.
Liam: All right, I clap. Excuse me, players?
Matt: As they're both looking over to grab a drink to stop and the younger guy with a scruffy chin and this mop of hair that's a little wild glances over to you: "Yeah?"
Liam: That was a really unique piece you guys just did there. Thank you.
Matt: "You're welcome."
Liam: You know, I have only ever heard music like that one time, and it wasn't here. It wasn't in this city, it was actually in Emon. What was his name? Dranzel. It was a musician named Dranzel-- this is a long shot, but you haven't come across a Dr. Dranzel in your travels? I've always wanted to hear him play again.
Matt: "Can't say I have, sir. My apologies."
Liam: Oh, shit.
Matt: "Sorry. You guys ever heard of Dr. Dranzel?" And the other guy goes, "Nope."
Liam: Orcish. Stylish hats.
Matt: The goliath woman is sitting there and she is just staring off across the room and goes, "No." (laughter)
Matt: "Sorry, friend."
Laura: I'm keeping an eye on the side of the room that he glanced in, looking for anybody going and delivering drinks to the people.
Matt: Okay. You watch the gentleman who has been getting you guys drinks, and he is in the process of getting all of your various drink orders and pouring what you have requested, and he does come to a point where he gets this one fine jewel goblet that he has specifically set off to the side and he takes it and washes it and takes care to clean it entirely and dry it off, and once it's set there he reaches underneath, counting a few bottles and pulls one drink, uncorks it and there is this thick dark brown glass jug and as he uncorks it he pours it into there, glances over, grabs another thing, seems to be mixing it with something else. He is being very careful with the actual amounts he is pouring. He finishes that, takes a piece of what looks like an orange, crushes it in the inside and leaves the rind and takes it and swishes it for a second. (sighs) And walks over to a table across the entire hall, where you saw him glance before.
Sam: One sex on the beach! (laughter)
Matt: He walks over to a table where you see what appear to be about five different patrons at the table. Most of them wealthily dressed. Two of them appear to be older mercantile or business owners, they wear the jewelry on their hands very extravagantly and displaying both wealth and prestige to an ostentatious way that you know most high-end guild workers or owners tend to display. You are very familiar with caste systems that have emerged in a lot of these central metropolitan areas, and so you can very easily pick up some of those themes. Two of them appear as a contrast very simply dressed. No jewelry. You can't make out any details in this distance and there is one man who he hands the drink to, he sets it down in front of him and slides it forward. The man you see there, he has deep brown skin, marked, there appear to be a number of tattoos that curl up his arms and up the side of his neck and touch his ears on each side. He's wearing light, billowing clothes of silver and maroon silks that end about the elbow and are just hanging beneath, leaving the rest of his arm completely visible where you can see the tattoo continues up the forearm and grasps the back of the hand, almost like he has a gauntlet on that is just his skin. You see around him a series of gold and silver bracelets and rings that adorn his fingers. His face is framed by a lion's mane of black and gray dreadlocked hair. Because of your perception check, at this distance and your ranger-like eyes, you can see what you perceive to be a visible scar on his throat from ear to ear. He's currently mid-conversation with the patrons at the table, leaned back in his chair in a comfortable setting and as soon as the drink-- huh?
Laura: Can I read his lips?
Matt: Sure. Well, the drink arrives and gets pushed forward and you read the barkeep's lips as he says, "This drink is a gift to you from patrons on the other side of the place." And this individual, who you assume at this point is probably Korshad, gives a look and goes, (grunts). And he points over, right over to your table across the room. You watch as Korshad sits up, glances over your direction, sees you looking at him directly. Takes the drink, scoots it over next to his side, and folds his fingers and goes back into listening to the conversation of the other patrons. And the barkeep who is standing there is, "Right." And then goes back to the bar, gathers the rest of your drinks and brings them slowly over to your table and passes them out. "All right, got a second shiraz, for you there, sir. We've got a whiskey, and a whiskey. We got an ale and a meat pie for you. And you, well--" (laughs) He brings up these two mugs. They're simple ceramic mugs that are dark and handcrafted, and he sloshes them up to you and as you see inside, most ale has a good liquidy content. This has a very syrupy thick texture to it. He slides both forward and goes, "I don't expect you to drink both those back to back."
Ashley: Well, that's not up for you to decide, my friend. I get on my earring. Hey, String Bean, your drink is here.
Liam: Yeah, and Sarenrae will know if you drink it before I get back, so just hold onto it for me.
Ashley: Well, I can't make any promises.
Matt: And he leans forward and goes, "This here is the Change-Bringer's Nectar. You sip this, slowly."
Laura: The Change-Bringer's Nectar?
Marisha: Write that shit down. Can Keyleth get up and walk past the diplomats' table and run my hands--
Matt: Well, you guys are all at the same table now.
Marisha: Oh, we're at the same table now?
Matt: Yeah, one table got up as soon as you sat down.
Marisha: Oh, so we scootched together? Okay, then I'm just going to lean into Vex and give her an Enhance Ability on her charisma.
Laura: Ooh! I'll take that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: You get advantage--
Laura: On charisma checks?
Marisha: Yeah. On checks.
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: Her cleavage gets a little nicer.
Laura: It can't get any nicer than it already is.
Taliesin: Very fair.
Liam: All said out loud.
Taliesin: Pike, which one of those two is Vax's? Which one of those two belongs to Vax?
Ashley: This one.
Taliesin: Oh that one? I'm taking a sip of it.
Ashley: Take a sip. It's very thick.
Matt: It's very thick, and it's sweeter than you expected, but it has a definite burn that grows and grows after drinking it. It's syrupy, but because of its syrupy texture, as it goes down it also coats and numbs everything as it touches.
Liam: Percy, I saw that. You have to buy me a whole other drink.
Taliesin: That's fine. I put my whiskey in its place and take the whole cup.
Liam: No motherfucker, that's not what I said! I want to drink that one and the one after it! Oh, you don't want to start with me, Fredrickstein.
Travis: Are you sipping it?
Ashley: I'm sipping it. I'm doing as the locals do. Enjoying it how he told me.
Matt: And you get the sense it's probably a good thing.
Ashley: It burns!
Matt: It's almost like maple syrup Everclear.
Ashley: Ugh!
Laura: Gross!
Travis: How's my meat pie?
Matt: Meat pie's pretty good!
Travis: This is pretty good!
Laura: That makes me want an empanada right now.
Liam: Role-playing, guys.
Matt: Sadly, no empanadas in Deastok.
Sam: Why isn't he coming over here? Should we send another drink? Maybe two this time.
Laura: He's in the middle of a conversation right now.
Taliesin: He has to sit and enjoy his drink.
Laura: Let him take some time.
Ashley: (slurring words) Should we sent him a Change-Bringer's Nectar? Oh no!
Laura: Oh no, Pike!
Ashley: (still slurring) I only had like three drinks. Three sips.
Travis: Keep going.
Laura: Just tiny sips.
Ashley: They were so small.
Laura: Drink some, maybe some water, too, in between each sip.
Ashley: Okay. Maybe some meat pie.
Taliesin: That's whiskey. That's supposed to be-- never mind. Go ahead.
Marisha: Hey, who's the Change-Bringer? Does anyone know? I feel like this drink is inspired. Can I do a check to see?
Matt: Make a religion check.
Marisha: Aw, I'm not good at this. Pike, you know gods!
Ashley: Let me see if I know. Will I know the Change-Bringer?
Marisha: Oh, please. I have no idea. I definitely have zero idea.
Ashley: I'm going to see if I can think of it. 14.
Matt: It's really not that hard. The Change-Bringer is Avandra. Avandra, one of the gods of the pantheon.
Marisha: Oh. Yeah, of course we knew that.
Matt: The Change-Bringer is the deity that looks over luck, looks over adventure, travel, the open road. That's as much as you can glean from your passing knowledge of the deity. Since you are not a woman of faith, obviously, you don't know much beyond that.
Marisha: It just sounded fancy.
Ashley: It sounded so fancy.
Matt: She's also known as "she who makes the path."
Laura: Hey, Tary.
Sam: Yes? Is it time? Should I go over there?
Laura: Just calm down. This is mainly what I'm trying to tell you right now. Stop being so weird.
Ashley: Do you want a sip of Change-Bringer's Nectar?
Laura: It might actually help you just a little bit.
Taliesin: Do what we do any time there's trouble. Sit down, pay attention, and do everything she says.
Laura: And don't look sneaky.
Taliesin: Have a sip of this. It'll help.
Laura: Yeah, seriously. Just have a little sip. A little sip, it's always good to relax your nerves.
Sam: All right.
Ashley: Loosey-goosey.
Sam: I'll take my helm and cock it to the side.
Laura: Yeah, jauntily. That's good, yeah.
Taliesin: Okay, now I feel like I'm on a listing ship.
Travis: What's your confident face look like? More tongue. Little further. Yep. Little higher eyebrow on the right side.
Laura: Okay, maybe stop. I'm just afraid he's going to look over here at any moment. I'm keeping an eye on good old Korshad, and seeing if he looks over here. I also want to see if I can catch his lips and see what he's talking about over on the side there.
Liam: And I would like to look around the room and make sure that other people aren't watching us, or if so, where in the bar they are.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: And I would like to make my way over to the goliath woman.
Matt: Okay. So as you begin walking in that direction, Vex. Couple things. One, you notice that Korshad, while he seems to be mostly being talked at or at least just listening to a conversation, when he does speak, he leans in and does this.
Laura: Of course he fucking does.
Matt: You get the sense he's a very guarded man and this is not his first rodeo. He speaks through his fingers.
Laura: I do, too!
Matt: But he doesn't appear to look over at your table again. He seems to have acknowledged the drink, is enjoying it slowly, and is back enthralled by the conversation at his table. What did you roll?
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. And what did you say you were going to do?
Marisha: Mimic Vex.
Matt: Okay. You both cover your mouths.
Laura: What are you doing?
Marisha: I'm following your lead.
Laura: You don't have to do that.
Taliesin: Does this one still work? We can do this one.
Laura: Yeah, that one's good. Just this.
Ashley: Is this good?
Laura: That's it, Pike. Pike's got it. He's definitely going to come over and talk to us now, I can feel it. We're so cool.
Taliesin: This is a lot of drink that I seem to have taken on.
Matt: Vax. Glancing about the chamber, remember I said there was a secondary platform, that didn't have any doorways to rooms, but there was just the upper walkway across the room both ways? There are about six figures on each one.
Liam: Six on each one?
Matt: They're all sitting there, wearing leather armor, mostly covered by a cloak. You glance up and you can see underneath at least two of the cloaks what appear to be the shape or outline of a crossbow at the ready.
Taliesin: 12 of them? 12 men?
Liam: I relay to the group quietly, yes. Packing. 12 or so above us all, so no sudden movements.
Matt: The music picks up again, Grog, as you're walking over. The next piece is occurring and you can see now that while the previous one had a frenetic tribal beat, this one has more of a scattered, if I could say percussion jazz sense. It tends to have multiple changes. Yeah, if you could. If you haven't heard the jazz timpani before, it's fantastic. It's more of an improvisational piece. You can see where they're each building off of each other, and then one will make a change and the others will shift with it. You don't notice this, because you really don't care, but anybody who had musical interests would be able to pick up on this. But you walk up and you see the goliath woman. Most of the goliath women you've come across, their lifestyle leads to either very short-kept or very tightly bound hair, as the coarse hair of the goliaths tends to mat up very thickly when living in the wild as your tribe did. This goliath female's hair is really well kept, actually. It's almost shining, which catches you off guard entirely. She's not tattooed and appears to be in a trance as she's in the process of drumming away, not even looking at the two of her compatriots or any patron. She's spacing out and is currently enraptured by the music she's creating.
Travis: Are there any weapons around her feet or where she's sitting or playing?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: She has very nice boots. And as a man who has made boots in the past, you can acknowledge, those are very well-made boots.
Travis: Me Grog!
Liam: I just love the alacrity that Travis goes to two, three. It's so good.
Travis: You play good!
Matt: The head slowly turns and the eyes focus for a second in the dim, snow-blind looking pupils, and gives you a nod.
Travis: Nice hair.
Matt: Head turns a little to the side.
Travis: I'll be-- if you--
Ashley: Tell her she has nice boots, Grog.
Travis: What?
Ashley: Tell her she has nice boots.
Travis: Nice boobs!
Matt: (bang) Big drum hit, and her part of the song comes to a halt. The two other bits of music alter but continue the beats, and she just--
Travis: Boots. Nice boots. Bidet. And I go back to the group.
Matt: As you walk back to the group, a little dejected, Vax, since you're the one who's paying attention the most at this point, you notice as the goliath gets this small grin on the side of her face and continues to go back to the drums.
Laura: You charmed her!
Marisha: Look at you!
Liam: Nice work, de Bergerac!
Matt: But Grog doesn't see it.
Ashley: I'll be your Cyrano!
Matt: All right. So what's the next order of business, guys?
Taliesin: Is that conversation breaking up?
Laura: That's what I planned on doing, is waiting out that conversation. I in no way want to interrupt it.
Matt: About 20 additional minutes go by. Another round is bought at the table, with Korshad still slowly, very carefully sipping the drink that you guys bought for him. Doesn't appear to be slowing, doesn't appear to be breaking. You can keep waiting if you want.
Laura: I want to get one of those fancy drinks for myself and see what it is.
Sam: You mean the Korshad drink?
Laura: I want one of the Korshad drinks.
Matt: One of the Korshad drinks, okay.
Taliesin: I would assume you've already had this stuff at this point. We've been sharing a cup around. This is too much for a human being to handle.
Matt: Do you go to the bar?
Laura: I'll go up to the bar. We don't know his name, do we? The bartender's name?
Matt: You haven't asked him yet, no. There are a few barhands that walk around, but the one you've been going with, you can go ahead and catch his eye as you go through the area. "Hey, do you need something?"
Laura: Of course, darling. I didn't catch your name.
Matt: "Oh! Wence."
Laura: Wence, thank you so much. Could I grab another of those fabulous five-gold drinks there, that you brought to our friend?
Matt: "Oh, you want Schlond's Embrace. Okay. If you're sure about that."
Laura: I don't know, what is it?
Matt: "It's an acquired taste. It's made from a very long-distilled, 40-year processing of a heavy mint leaf, and that, when it's been very thickly fermented, is mixed in with this very sour port base that's been repeatedly funneled and sifted until it's become almost thick in its own right. That's mixed together with a few other sugars and a bit of a special fruit. Honestly, I think it tastes pretty shitty, but it's what he likes."
Laura: I'm going to give it a go.
Matt: "All right then! Five gold." He goes and makes the drink for you again.
Laura: Slowly but surely marking little amounts off this party fund, y'all.
Marisha: Need to make some more money.
Matt: However, he does not bring it in the same glass. He brings it in a regular glass. You get the sense that the glass that was filled was his own. But it's delivered and it's different. It almost has a weird, mushroomy flavor to it. The fermentations involved in the processing of this is not the type of alcohol you'd expect. It's a little musty. But it's functional, and it has an aftertaste that comes to a very strong mint, like a wintergreen afterwards. It's a very strange mixture.
Laura: It's like brushing your teeth, only you get drunk.
Matt: Yeah, kind of. In fact, elements of it taste like having orange juice after brushing your teeth.
Laura: Foul.
Matt: Yeah. It's a little rough at times.
Marisha: What are you learning about the man by what he drinks?
Laura: I'm learning that he probably has minty fresh breath.
Marisha: Oh, really?
Ashley: Maybe you should cheers him from afar so he can see you're drinking it.
Laura: Yeah, but mine's in an ugly cup.
Marisha: They didn't give you the same cup?
Travis: I have nice cups. Do you want a jewel-encrusted chalice?
Laura: Do you have one?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Pull it out.
Travis: I'm like fucking Bed, Bath, and Beyond in this bitch. Jewel-encrusted chalice.
Laura: Do you really have a jewel-encrusted-- you do, in your fucking Bag of Holding?
Travis: Not anymore, it's getting marked off now.
Laura: Sweet. I'm going to clean that shit out, pour it in.
Taliesin: The interior of that bag looks like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. It's a little weird in there.
Matt: It is a silver and pewter chalice that contains a number of multi-colored gems embedded along the sides, going to the base.
Laura: This is gorgeous.
Matt: Lil' Jon would be proud. It's beautiful.
Laura: Taryon. You drink out of this one.
Sam: That drink?
Laura: Yeah, you're the one that bought him the drink. Look like you're drinking it, too.
Sam: All right. Pinky out.
Laura: How is it? Do you like it?
Sam: I love it. (whispers) It's terrible.
Laura: I know.
Sam: I'll just laugh, way too loud. (laughs) And then she said to me, that's not armor!
Matt: Another 20 or so minutes pass in the tavern.
Matt: Some folks have entered since then, some have left. The patrons that are here don't seem to be-- there isn't a lot of switching in and out. Seems like most of the folks here come here fairly often at the end of the day, whether to go about their business or to unwind. But no one seems to be approaching you, no one's crossing your path.
Marisha: I'm so bored.
Laura: Can I go over and talk to Wence one more time?
Matt: Sure. You catch his attention. He comes back to the table as you step up and start in his direction, he goes, "Hey. Another round, eh?"
Laura: Actually, no. I give him five gold.
Matt: "All right. You want another one?"
Laura: No, I'd rather not. No, I was just wondering, do you know how long Korshad usually hangs out here every night?
Matt: "Varies. Easily probably another hour or so."
Laura: Always with the same company, or different people?
Matt: "Varies. They've been here most of the afternoon."
Laura: Oh, wow. Would you mind going over to him and just letting him know that the gentleman who bought him the drink would love a moment of his time.
Matt: "Oh, all right."
Laura: Taryon Darrington. He needs to know the name.
Matt: "Okay. I will." He looks at the gold and goes, "All right. I will."
Laura: No rush. But make sure it happens.
Matt: You see he noticeably gets a little nervous. Walks over. Do you go back to your table to join your compatriots? Okay. As you're watching, he actually has to psych himself up. He approaches and then turns around and stops for a second, and goes up to the table again and stops himself and gets the gumption up this time and goes to the table. And you see him talking to Korshad, who at this point has his hand on the tip of the drink, glances up at him. Looks over at the table again.
Laura: I walk over and put my hand on Taryon's shoulder and keep eye-contact with Korshad.
Matt: You see a smile creep slowly across Korshad's face. Puts his hand up and immediately you can watch as Wence, who's in the middle of talking and expressing this goes, "Yes." And quickly darts away. Korshad gives a point to the rest of the guys and you watch his lips say, "Excuse me a moment." He stands up.
Sam: Make some room. Grog, leave!
Marisha: I scoot with Grog.
Travis: We get up. I get up.
Marisha: I get up with Grog, too. Oh, I have to pee. Do you want to go pee?
Matt: As Korshad's walking across the room, Vax, you do watch as all the individuals that are on the upper platform all watch him go through the room and are now seeing the table and where they are standing. The attention is very strongly on what is about to transpire.
Liam: So far just eyes, though?
Marisha: Yeah, I start paying attention to the room as well, with Grog.
Liam: Grand Poobah, here.
Laura: You said that over the earring?
Liam: That was Liam.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Korshad walks his way over to the table and you can see, as he walks through, occasionally somebody at a nearby table will stop and watch him him. Very quickly to you, you get the sense that he's definitely one of the more powerful figures that seems to come in and out of this establishment. He approaches the edge of the table, still holding the cup from the upper lip. There's like a lip at the very edge that he keeps clasped with his fingers as it drifts there in front of him, and he occasionally sips from it that way as he walks towards you. Comes up to the edge of the table. "Do you mind if I sit here?"
Laura: Oh please, join us.
Matt: He sits down and places the cup on the table. (muffled) "So." (laughter)
Matt: "My man Wence tells me that you are requesting my presence."
Laura: Yes. For the sake of this. I'm going to move my hands but just know my hands are here the whole time. Okay?
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Laura: I'm sure you're familiar with Taryon here.
Sam: Taryon Darrington, of the Darrington family.
Matt: I have not had the pleasure, but I know of you.
Laura: And you are familiar with his father as well?
Matt: "Quite."
Laura: We've heard tell of recent situations with his family and you.
Matt: "And?"
Laura: And we were hoping we could come to an agreement.
Matt: "What agreement do you have proposed?"
Laura: Well, I don't know if you've heard of Vox Machina?
Matt: "We trade in a great many things. Information being one. And I am well aware of who you are."
Laura: And I'm well aware that someone like you could find a good use for someone like us.
Matt: "Are you offering your services?"
Laura: Potentially. If it could help clear the Darrington name.
Matt: (sighs) "You are not wrong. I, myself, am the keeper of the deeds. I consider the Darrington estate a long-growing loan that is now ripening. You see, our community here thrives on a principle that other syndicates in Exandria lack. Patience. I have been letting this stew for a very, very long time, so if you wish to make any sort of dent in this debt, your task will have to be equally monumental."
Sam: Well, I can make magical items, if there's something that you need made or enchanted. We have other members of the group that do different things. We have a fine tinkerer, if you need something made for you. Vex here is an excellent shot. She could put on an archery show or something, if that would be something worthwhile to you. You know, if that will help ease the debt. I know my family owes you quite a bit of money.
Laura: 230,000 gold. If we're hearing correctly.
Matt: "You are correct. For the time being."
Sam: And might I inquire, as it is my family's debt: what is the timetable on that? Will you be coming to collect anytime soon?
Matt: "I have given your father a date of six months to pay this debt. If it is not paid, then the deeds, as agreed upon many years ago, transition to my name entirely. I am not going to kick your family to the street; I am not a terrible man. But I will be possessing all of your belongings."
Sam: Will they be in any physical danger?
Matt: "No. Not unless they put up a fight."
Sam: Well, I don't know much about you, but I assume you would much rather have the cash than have to own property and manage it.
Matt: "Both have their uses."
Sam: All right.
Laura: So would the Darringtons simply work for you?
Matt: "The family, I will happily give them time to find whatever place they can afford to live or leave the city entirely. It is not my business. However, I will be taking over the farms, I will be taking over the business, I will be taking over the estate. Most of the assets within, they will become property of the Myriad."
Taliesin: Well, there. That's where I think we could come to an arrangement. We're not particularly invested in the power structure here. We're here for sentimental reasons. The estate and just enough property to maintain a modest comfortability. We don't really care what happens to the fortune so long as your family's taken care of.
Sam: Yes, I guess.
Taliesin: You keep your house, you keep your things, you keep a little bit of property to manage.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: What do you think? I mean, they did make this bed. I'm suggesting to you that maybe it is not your job to save your family's power and allow them to keep going as the way they have. But just to give them enough that even if they-- that they can continue with reasonable means. Maybe not necessarily living the life that they were living before but living far more comfortably.
Sam: Even that would be a step up, but it seems like we would have to do something in order just to earn that much.
Taliesin: Oh, I imagine so. It's just, there's a difference between saving everything and saving enough to keep them comfortable.
Matt: "If I am to understand you correctly, you are willing to offer your service to us?"
Taliesin: Possibly.
Matt: "And in exchange, we would still be taking the land-based assets from the Darrington name, other than the estate and enough means to live comfortably."
Taliesin: And enough income property for them to be relatively comfortable. Reasonably comfortable. I'm sure we can take a look at the assets and come to a very, very reasonable arrangement. And you, in turn-- well, we could have a discussion about what that would be worth to you. I have no interest in making an arrangement that doesn't please you. We're only here, again, for sentimental reasons. We are not invested beyond that.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: Please, god. You've been terrible today. 15.
Matt: He goes, "Comfortable living is a relative thing. To maintain my comfort of living, well, your estate is but a drop in the bucket. But, and I mean no offense--" as he looks about the rest of you-- "Comfortable living for some of you, well, that could be as much as my drink would cost."
Sam: My family would require their main property and all residential rental property.
Matt: "That is not a deal. The residential and the farm territory is to become mine. I would leave for them your estate and enough gold to live a comparably comfortable lifestyle than living on the street for years to come. They could then strike out on their own, start a new fortune if they wish. Perhaps land barony was not their strong suit. You seem to have found other pursuits, maybe you could lead them in a new path."
Laura: And past that point, they would be in no debt to you?
Matt: "Past that point, and a task done in our favor by the famed Vox Machina. Maybe."
Sam: Would they get to maintain possession of their personal property? Artwork, statues?
Matt: "Everything that remains within the estate home itself would be yours to keep. The rest is mine."
Sam: And what is this task?
Matt: "Roughly 120 miles east of here lies a sinkhole. It has swallowed the core of the platinum mines of Herethis a few months back. Now, those mines are a very lucrative point of business for my employers. And every time we've sent scouts to inspect the source of this erosion, none have returned. Many very capable and proven men, unheard again. One of our greatest diviners has since spoken of a powerful force within this mine. Ancient. Birthed improperly. But now seems to grow more and more mad. We're at a loss, so we've put out a contract or two, but nothing has taken a bite yet. If you were to go to this mine, find this entity that has ruined our mining operation there, return with proof of its demise, and we confirm its destruction, I will consider our task complete."
Taliesin: We'll also need some operating capital for this. It sounds dangerous, so we will take the job, but we will need to also charge a very reasonable fee, I think, on top of this.
Matt: "That is entirely understood. And we will keep track of each fee, and we will deduct it from the materials in the Darrington estate."
Laura: If we take care of this for you, it does seem like a monumental task.
Matt: "It may not be. But it would seem to be something of your skill set."
Laura: From what we've learned, ancient beings tend to be quite powerful. We would ask that you don't slander the Darrington name. That when they stay in their estate, everyone believes they are still the Darringtons as they have always been.
Matt: "I would agree to that. I have no interests in your family's public image. I believe that damage has been done well enough on your own."
Sam: Yes. Are you sure you don't have a cloak I could just enchant and then we could call it square?
Matt: (chuckling) He takes another sip from his drink. "When all this is said and done, Taryon, we'll be in contact. I think there is much business we could do in the future."
Sam: All right. I suppose we have no choice.
Taliesin: We do.
Laura: There's always a choice, dear.
Marisha: You could marry the girl or we could go kill an ancient being.
Taliesin: I'm feeling pretty good about this one.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: All right.
Laura: Do we need to decide at this moment?
Sam: Seems like we do.
Taliesin: We will also need all of the information you have on this creature in the mines, and if you have anybody who has access to that--
Laura: The diviner would be wonderful to speak to.
Matt: "The information I have given you is what the diviner has found."
Sam: I'm not going to ask you all to risk your lives for my shitty family, so I will pursue this matter on my own if I have to.
Laura: Good. Yeah. You're going to go by yourself.
Sam: Well, I would hire a couple of people to come with me, but if you'd like to accompany me, I'd be okay with that too.
Travis: We could watch you do it. That'd be pretty funny.
Sam: Well, I mean, you've taught me a lot, so maybe I could do it.
Laura: I think you're good.
Ashley: You won't find anybody as good as us.
Sam: Of course not.
Marisha: You are very skilled in hiring talented mercenaries. That might be your strongest suit.
Sam: I am one for two on that count.
Taliesin: And we do have another mercenary at our beck, if we need. That's actually very fair. You're already one up.
Sam: Should we vote on it then? Grog, do you want to go kill something big and scary?
Travis: Yes.
Sam: Pike, are you drunk?
Ashley: I think you should marry whoever you want. So that's what I think we should do. Yes. Yea. I vote yea.
Sam: Twinsies?
Laura: Always have your back, dear.
Sam: Oh, Vax isn't here. Hey Vax. You want to go help me save my family by risking our lives in almost certain death?
Liam: What does that entail?
Sam: I'll take that as a yes. Keyleth?
Marisha: Vax says yes, and so do I! Aye!
Sam: Science bro?
Taliesin: Vex says yes, and I am so in the mood to kill something. (laughter)
Marisha: I think we've all risked our lives for each other at one point and another, so it's your turn, Tary. Welcome to the family.
Taliesin: Cheers. This stuff burns.
Matt: And this whole conversation he's had his mouth covered, he takes his fingers away from his mouth and he takes the drink. "Do we have an accord?" Picks his drink up and clinks it. "Return when the deed is done." Slaps the table and stands up and walks back. And at this point, that you notice, the tables nearby, everyone's been just quietly watching in on this. As soon as he leaves they go back to their business and drinking.
Taliesin: Everyone, on the count of three, we're going to stand up very quickly.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Why? Okay.
Liam: Wait! No, I'm just fucking with you.
Laura: Three! Let's go!
Matt: As you do that, about half the folks get startled by it. The music's still going.
Laura: On the way out, can I grab Wence again, one last time?
Matt: "Hey."
Laura: Most of the people here, are they local patrons or do they come from all over?
Matt: "Most of them are local and come from all over."
Laura: Great. Thank you.
Matt: "Sorry."
Laura: It's all I needed.
Matt: "I just serve the drinks, miss."
Travis: Can I make my way back over to the players?
Matt: Okay. She's sitting there. (drumming)
Travis: Can I have your name?
Matt: (drumming)
Travis: (louder) Can I have your name?
Matt: As she's still drumming her head slowly turns around and she goes, "Camilla." (drumming)
Travis: Thank you, and I leave.
Matt: (laughs) All right. With that, we're going to take a break. Try and get back here in a minute guys, see this next bit of interesting fun.
Marisha: To Camilla!
Matt: All right guys, so we have tonight's Wyrmwood giveaway: this awesome butternut wood and leather dice tray. Giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood. Come on over, jump into the Twitch chat to enter for the possibility to win this, the word for the night is Myriad. That is M-Y-R-I-A-D. If you don't know, look it up on Google.
Marisha: You'll win it if you spell it right.
Matt: Exactly. Butternut up or shut up with your Myriad spelling. All right guys, be back here in a few minutes. See you in a second. [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Critical Role. Which, timing works out interesting sometimes. Yeah, welcome back to the game. We had our break. Going to go ahead and jump in here.
Liam: I feel cheated. I didn't hear any of that.
Sam: (belches)
Laura: Nice.
Sam: Thanks.
Matt: As you guys have found your way out of what seems to be this strange subterranean bar beneath the Grumpy Lily, you've agreed to, at least for the time being, to make your way east to this mine, which currently seems to be under the-- what's it called? The Platinum Mines of Herethis. Herethis. Which you, Taryon, you understand. Herethis is a region, a regional forest area over there. The Herethis Wood. About 120 miles east. You guys decide: What's your best means of travel? How do you intend to get there?
Sam: We have to misty there, right? Because you don't know any trees in the area?
Marisha: I could scry on the area if I knew enough about it.
Taliesin: If we misty there we could also camp for the night.
Laura: Yeah, we need to camp because we need to rest and get our shit back.
Marisha: That's fine. It's 120 miles.
Matt: It's not terribly far, as the mist flies.
Marisha: Yep. I'm pretty fresh.
Taliesin: We can misty there, camp for the night.
Travis: (repeatedly, getting deeper) Yeah. (laughter)
Travis: Character voice.
Matt: Well, I'll go ahead and by the way, because I totally forgot. We do have a winner in the chatroom. Besolis8926, you won the giveaway.
Liam: You got the Nutter Butter box!
Matt: Yeah, Denova will contact you for your information to get it shipped to you, so congratulations. All right, so. What are you thinking about for travel? You're just doing the Wind Walk?
Marisha: All right, before we leave, is there any type of research we should potentially do?
Travis: Nope. Headlong. (laughter)
Sam: I don't know what we'd be researching. The guy who sent us on the mission doesn't even know what it is.
Liam: It's not even nearby, so it's not like we could ask people what the mine is like. It's 120 miles away.
Travis: Yep.
Liam: The mines of "hear this."
Laura: Herethis.
Travis: This is right up our alley. Like this is literally what we've been training for our whole lives.
Marisha: I mean, just in case there's maybe some ancient deity that rules over the forest of Herethis and some sort of goddess? Fuck it, let's go.
Laura: I mean, do we know anything? Have we ever heard about the woods of Herethis or the Platinum Mines of Herethis?
Matt: You guys haven't. You have. They're woods that lead into this small rocky-- it's almost too small to be a mountain range and more just large, rocky hills. But there's no historical significance to the location that you know of. Go ahead and make a history check.
Travis: Roll high.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Sam: Oh yeah! 21.
Matt: 21. You do know a number of the large-scale battles that took place towards the end of the Age of Arcanum took place on Wildmount. In fact, Zorhaus, the other kingdom that we were discussing before is largely a badlands, barren landscape because that was where the final battle between the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities took place. And the sheer volume of, the sheer intensity of that battle laid waste to the landscape there, so you have the Dwendalian Empire and the whole western side of Wildmount, which is fairly lush and functional, then towards the Zorhaus Kingdom is, and that whole eastern side of the continent, a lot of it is just barren, cracked, destroyed. But you do know that Herethis, the name, at least, stems from a hero that fell in a battle long ago. You can't recall the specific details of it, but there is some significance to the title or at least the location there to something ancient and old. May have to deal with this time period of entities battling gods. That's the best you can make out. The mines are well known. The Platinum Mines are well known. They're not well attended. They're not a public space, and they're definitely under the control of a number of companies that are shadow corporations under the control of the Myriad. You can see where the connection and the necessity for it to be reopened again is important. Platinum is not a very common metal.
Travis: Anything we should be worried about?
Sam: Gods attacking us.
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: Trial run.
Laura: Oh man. No, but really, that's where the battles took place, huh? So this ancient being could be from, potentially--
Sam: Or it could not.
Taliesin: Whatever it is, it's not leaving the mine.
Liam: We're running off on a lark, but we've raked ourselves in the faces before.
Laura: Yeah! If we die, we die.
Sam: Oh god, I don't want to die.
Taliesin: Well, no one wants to die.
Marisha: Well, once again--
Laura: Don't say it, Keyleth. Do not fucking say it.
Travis: Don't incant that shit again.
Laura: Don't say it about all of us and doom us to your fate.
Travis: Goldfish.
Marisha: Duty. (laughter)
Travis: Better.
Sam: Before we go, was there something you wanted to tell the drow woman?
Laura: Oh shit.
Liam: If we're talking about what we were talking about before, I don't think it's a good idea.
Travis: Why?
Liam: If you want to go and find him, us, and say hi, that's a different story.
Laura: I would like to point out that this same person you are so adamantly protecting from our scrying or our spying or our finding is the same person who shit in the middle of a temple so that he could watch Pike.
Liam: Well, A) he did that, not us, and B) we were all very much friends and happy with each other when he did that, and he is not happy with us. It's not exactly the same thing, dear. But if you want to go with me and find him and check in and say hello, I'd be very happy to do that with you. But to send the woman who threw our friend, drugged, over the back of a horse, and took him off to his family? I don't really want to send her after Scanlan, to look in on him or follow him or watch him or anything him. It didn't sound like his father wanted him dragged back on the back of a horse, and it happened anyway. She doesn't seem very trustworthy to me. Yeah, she's cool. So what?
Laura: I just realized I have the other half of the stone. The traveling stone.
Marisha: That we gave Scanlan.
Laura: I could pop in on him anytime I want.
Taliesin: Or he could pop in on you anytime.
Marisha: But he hasn't.
Travis: If he has it, still.
Marisha: Yeah, maybe he threw it into the ocean for all we know.
Travis: Ooh, that would suck because then we'd be in the ocean.
Laura: That would be really, really shit if he did that.
Marisha: It would be a massively dickish move.
Liam: That was very smart, Grog.
Travis: Hey.
Taliesin: Wow, that happened.
Travis: In your face.
Liam: Oh. Anyway, my point still stands. Once we wrap up here if you want to go find him I will go with you.
Marisha: And do what? Convince him to come back?
Liam: No.
Marisha: See if he's okay? Ask him how his year's been?
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: What about just a location and she has to stay unseen? You know, I know Keyleth can scry and stuff but--
Taliesin: We could make her walk first into the mines.
Marisha: Yeah, you didn't want me to even scry on him and now we're talking about just popping in on him? I feel like there's a weird crossing of the lines.
Travis: Yeah, but that was a year ago. I'm over that sentiment.
Marisha: Oh man, Grog.
Travis: Yeah. Yep.
Marisha: You guilted me very hard on that. You made me feel kind of shitty.
Travis: This is Grog evolved.
Marisha: No, you kind of got it right. Just go with it.
Taliesin: Exalted?
Laura: Exalted?
Travis: Absorbed. Yep.
Liam: You done been woked.
Travis: Woked.
Liam: So woked.
Laura: No, but seriously. What are we doing? I don't think we use that mercenary to walk into a mine. I'm not sending her to her death.
Taliesin: I am perfectly content to hold onto that chit for as long as we need.
Liam: Save that for a rainy day. We don't need to punch that ticket now.
Sam: Should we at least ask her to stay in town? For a to-be-determined mission later?
Travis: Well, I think she needs to keep up her employment, right?
Sam: We can give her a little money to keep around, a retainer.
Laura: No.
Sam: I can give her a little money. I might need her.
Taliesin: She was employed. She's reachable through employment. We can just find out how to reach her.
Travis: Oh, yeah, that one!
Sam: She might be gone.
Taliesin: You have to be able to hire her. I'm sure there's a system.
Sam: We have no idea how she was hired in the first place.
Laura: We go ask her how to hire her.
Sam: All right, well then let's do that.
Marisha: And no one has heard from him at all over the course of the year?
Travis: Who?
Laura: Oh. Well, he writes me all the time, but outside of that.
Travis: What? Really?! Scanlan does?!
Marisha: She's messing with you.
Travis: That was very mean.
Taliesin: You promised you'd keep that secret.
Liam: She has a mean streak.
Laura: (laughs) I have so many secrets to keep, dear. So many.
Travis: I'm mad for an (stutters) a long time.
Liam: I know one of them. When she farts it sounds like a duck.
Laura: It really does.
Marisha: That's kind of cute.
Laura: We go find-- (laughs)
Taliesin: You're going to fart awkwardly and we're going to yell "imposter!"
Matt: All right, so you find K'rynn. She let you know that she was just around the corner from where the estate was and let you know where to find her, and it's like an open tent/lounge area. She's just currently drinking water and eating a little bit of dried meat, and as you approach, she stands up. She still has her illusion on. She still has her pale skin. You get the sense that drow in general are not-- they don't have the easiest time walking through large societal establishments. "You returned. So what did you need?"
Sam: We have no mission at this moment, but we may call on you shortly after we return.
Matt: "Very well."
Sam: Can we find you here or will you be gone?
Matt: "I have no interest in staying in this city in particular. I generally prefer to stay around Vashlow."
Sam: Where's that?
Matt: "Vashlow? It's to the west of here. About 25 miles southeast of Port Demali."
Travis: Port Demali.
Matt: "If you wish to contact me, you can send a missive to Vashlow, or if you have access to a practitioner of the arcane arts, perhaps a Sending would be sufficient."
Sam: Sending, okay.
Laura: Definitely.
Sam: All right. Well, stand by. We'll call you. Thank you for your time, and we'll be in touch.
Matt: "Very well. It was just business."
Sam: Sorry about your horse.
Matt: "Eh. Fair trade." She gets up and gathers her little satchel over the side of her shoulder. "Until we meet again." She nods and then walks out into the darkness of the night.
Laura: Never to be heard from again because we'll forget that we have that connection. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so what are you guys doing?
Sam: Let's Misty Step. Let's Wind Walk.
Laura: Misty Step tonight and then that way we can recover everything?
Taliesin: In the morning.
Marisha: Yeah, what time is it?
Matt: You're in the evening now.
Laura: Let's Misty Step there--
Matt: Misty Step is a very different spell.
Laura: Oh, sorry.
Liam: We go 30 feet. (laughter)
Sam: We're going to be windtalkers.
Matt: Yes. All right, so you guys go ahead and transform into your misty forms via the Wind Walk spell and begin making your way to the east, towards the Herethis Wood. Travel is pretty rapid. It's a clear sky. The moon's still pretty-- it's only been a few days since the last full moon when you guys had the ritual up at the top of the mountains with the Trickfoots, so it's very easy to see the details, especially those of keen vision. Rather rapidly, you find yourselves to the outskirts of the Herethis Forest, and after doing a couple passes overhead, you can see there is a portion of the forest that is open, and there you can see there are a couple of stone towers set up. There appear to be large ropes and cables fastened at the edges of what looks to be a large circular ravine, some sort of an entry port, a very large hole in the ground. And as you approach and get close you can see that, while there are two standing towers, there appear to be remnants of two other towers that have fallen in, and looking at some of the cables and the way that some of the equipment is set up, it appears that this sinkhole that he spoke of that consumed a portion of this entryway, whether it be a quake or something, a lot of the structure that was placed around the outside of the mine has fallen in, and is precariously being held either dangling over the inside by cable work or has crumpled somewhere at the bottom of this abyssal hole you see before you.
Marisha: What do you mean by--
Matt: When I say abyssal hole, that's just a descriptive way of saying it is pitch black from this distance. You cannot see anything past the top.
Sam: And it's connected to the Abyssal Plane.
Matt: It is actually a doorway to the Abyss. Hey guys! Orcus tonight!
Marisha: Finale!
Travis: Do we have any glow sticks that we could throw in and watch fall?
Taliesin: Yes, we actually do.
Matt: Have you guys transitioned back to your physical forms to have this conversation?
Marisha: Yeah. Well, we can float down.
Taliesin: If we're doing our little circle, I would say that a little bit of a distance.
Laura: Yeah, I don't want to camp right next to the--
Taliesin: About half a mile away.
Liam: I'm looking for cooties around the outside.
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Liam: Cooties.
Laura: Did you get it?
Ashley: No, it's right here.
Liam: Dang it. 24.
Matt: 24. Okay, you start coasting over the edge, and you can see there are broken carts and crates. You can see the remains of what seem to be a couple of humanoid bodies, mostly picked away to the point where there's just slightly pinkish bone from whatever dried bits of muscle or blood that remain, the rest of the flesh and organs pulled from or dissolved. You're not sure.
Laura: I think a Cure Wounds, a light Cure Wounds would probably help.
Sam: Dead talk?
Taliesin: They don't talk back, but yeah.
Sam: Let's do that.
Travis: Oh yeah, you can do that!
Ashley: We can talk to the dead. I have it.
Laura: We'll land a little bit away.
Travis: We didn't land yet, right?
Laura: Let's land a little bit away.
Liam: Getting some Baldur's Gate vibes here, man.
Matt: So you land about half a mile out, and you guys transition back to your physical forms. Vax shares the information and what he spotted.
Laura: Were the bodies on top or were the bodies down below?
Liam: On the edges, right?
Matt: They were on the edges.
Marisha: And when you mean seared, like acid? Or like heat?
Matt: Like white and pink bone. Like just whatever flesh was on there has been picked off.
Ashley: Like something was eating them?
Taliesin: Can we speak to dead?
Laura: Pike can do that.
Taliesin: Why don't you two misty there, somebody start setting up camp for tonight.
Laura: I'll go with Pike and we can stealth in.
Marisha: I'll start setting up camp.
Taliesin: You can still misty. We're still misty-able. You can fly in, talk to them, and fly back out.
Laura: She can't talk to them as mist.
Taliesin: I mean, land and then--
Laura: Oh, okay. I'll cast Pass Without a Trace, anyways, so we'll be stealthy going in. So I do that.
Matt: All right, so. Is it just you, Pike? Who's going with you?
Laura: And me.
Liam: I'm already standing by the bodies, yeah.
Matt: All right, so you go back to the bodies with them?
Laura: Okay, you're still out there?
Liam: No, I--
Matt: All right, so the three of you are turning back to mist and making your way back toward the entrance.
Taliesin: I'm going to set up the tents.
Matt: Okay. You guys land near the edge of this crumpled rock and you see where the ground itself has curled in and collapsed inward, and there are a number of cables or ropes that go across and various large structures, the stone towers that sit at the edge of this opening. You can see there's tension on these ropes and either the rope's going to snap at some point as the weather gets harsher over here, or the rock is going to crumble in if the ground keeps eroding. You're not sure if it's done, or if it's a slow crawling thing. There before you, you see a body. You can see elements of clothing, torn and dried, crusted with old blood. You see a boot that's left off to the side. The foot's been removed, but it looks like the edge of it's been torn and ripped a bit. The skeleton's been picked clean.
Ashley: Okay. We only see the one body?
Matt: There are three bodies around the whole exterior, but you've landed next to one.
Liam: When you said picked clean, do they look like they've been chewed upon?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: It's fine. 18.
Matt: Looking at the bones, you can see signs of what appear to be scratches or grooves across the bones... It's interesting. A lot of the bones have a very smooth texture to them. You're used to seeing very porous, but it looks like elements of the bones have melted slightly.
Laura: Oh, gods.
Liam: Slimes, jellies. All right.
Laura: I'm going to get my broom ready. And while Pike is doing her ritual I'm just going to keep a hand on her, that if anything happens then I can just take off with her in tow.
Matt: Okay. Pike, you're casting Speak with Dead?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: All right. It's easy enough for you to cast it. It's quick. Ritual complete, you go ahead and you burn some incense.
Ashley: Okay, I get three questions.
Matt: And at which point, the skeleton, which is face down on the ground by the way, the skull (bone creaking) creaks up and looks over. Like, turns around and faces you as it reaches. It curls upward, almost in like an upward dog--
Laura: Like downward dog? Oh. What's that called?
Matt: Cobra position, but the head's turned completely around and curled up.
Liam: Oh, I get down close to it and go (groans) and I flip it over.
Matt: (rattling thud) It flips over on its back and the head (bone creaking) turns back around to its right.
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: You get five questions.
Ashley: Five questions.
Marisha: Five?
Ashley: Good day, sir. It's not a good day for you. Sorry.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: It's okay. Good start.
Ashley: What happened to you?
Matt: (raspy, strained) "Something in the mines we found. It hatched. Or woke. And its anger shook the halls. I tried to run, but the skittering beasts got me first."
Laura: Skittering beasts?
Travis: Godzilla.
Liam: That's more than one.
Laura: (whispering) What did the skitterers look like?
Ashley: What did the skittering beasts look like?
Laura: Oh, in my drink?
Liam: It flew away.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a dick.
Matt: (raspy, strained) "Large. Hard carapaces. Pincers. Many legs."
Ashley: (whispering) It's like spiders.
Travis: Umber hulk?
Liam: Umber hulk with many legs.
Marisha: That could be a glabrezu, which fucking killed you the first time. They have pincers.
Laura: Yeah, but that's really big.
Marisha: I don't know. Skittering beasts?
Ashley: Is there anyone else alive?
Liam: Did anything work against it?
Ashley: Oh, yeah that's a good question. (louder) Was there anything that you guys could tell of your knowledge-- did anything seem to damage it or work against it?
Matt: (grunts) He seems confused about what you're referring to. The skittering creature or the--
Ashley: Oh. The skittering creature or the big thing?
Laura: The skittering creatures?
Ashley: Both, because we still have--
Liam: Against them
Ashley: Against them! Against the skittering creatures
Matt: "The skittering creatures, we just ran. I didn't look to see."
Laura: That's already three questions.
Ashley: Okay. Oh god, this is not-- (whispering)
Ashley: How big were the creatures?
Matt: "They were rather large, maybe eight foot end to end. They burrow, they spit. But they were awoken by the smaller one."
Ashley: Wait, he said they spit?
Laura: I didn't hear, something about his spit. What did he say?
Matt: You gather, what he said was-- (laughing)
Matt: No, the skitterers bite, they spit. But they were awakened by the smaller one.
Marisha: The smaller one?
Laura: What's the smaller one?!
Liam: What can you tell us of the smaller one?
Sam: They spit. Maybe acid, probably.
Liam: Yeah, they're smooth, that means they were just like (slurping noises).
Ashley: Is there anything that you can tell us about the smaller one?
Matt: "It was like a baby, and it cried out and everything fell around us. I barely made it out, but the skitterers found me." (deep exhale) The enchantment leaves that embodied the skull, falls to rest, the bones now motionless.
Sam: So it can emit a cry that shakes everything.
Ashley: A baby, like a baby?
Liam: Mandrake?
Matt: I would say, Marisha--
Marisha: Does it sound like anything we have encountered? A nature check?
Matt: We'll say a nature check for both you and Vex.
Marisha: Would I have an advantage with my little book?
Matt: Not for this in particular.
Liam: It will be like the creature back in Stillben?
Laura: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Liam: And we have heard tales of mandrakes, and they scream.
Laura: Yeah, did the pincers sound like something we have fought though, before?
Matt: No, it's not something you've encountered before, necessarily.
Marisha: 19?
Matt: 19, okay. And Vex?
Laura: Nature check?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Do I get advantage because I'm standing in the woods? Six!
Taliesin: You know you're standing in the woods.
Matt: You have heard of a creature that does exist in subterranean and sometimes forested areas, referred to as an ankheg.
Marisha: An ankheg?
Matt: An ankheg. They generally tend to snatch cattle and beasts of burden in the night. They are large and insect-like. They spit an acidic fluid. Some of the things this corpse has described makes you think of that.
Liam: Isn't that what our bug juice is made out of?
Matt: You bug juice is made of sandkheg, which is a desert-based variant of that creature.
Laura: Oh. I wonder if we could sprinkle it around us and they won't bother us because we'll smell like their brethren.
Travis: I ain't wasting that shit!
Laura: Hey, man, it's an idea.
Marisha: So they snatch cattle--
Sam: So we should all be cows.
Marisha: Oh my god, you guys. Perfect opportunity!
Liam: Throwback Thursday!
Marisha: Throwback Thursday!
Matt: If only the person who could cast the spell was in your party anymore. He's elsewhere in the world right now.
Liam: That asshole.
Sam: We just talked to him. He was the dead body. (groaning)
Matt: All right, so what are you guys doing?
Sam: Well, we're going to rest for the night, and then go in at first light.
Laura: Yes, we definitely should have a Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: Yeah, let's have a Heroes' Feast, which-- okay, hang on, let me check here.
Travis: We don't need it.
Marisha: I can do a Heroes' Feast.
Taliesin: Protection from acid would probably be very--
Marisha: Okay, but my Wind Walk-- I already Wind Walked, so I can do a Heroes' Feast at a higher level. I also want to do a 5th-level Commune with Nature.
Matt: Okay. 5th-level Commune with Nature.
Marisha: What should I ask? What should I ask that we don't already know?
Sam: I mean, is there any nature down there? It's a mine. It's all rocks.
Marisha: Well, I can see in a two-, three-mile radius.
Travis: How deep does the hole go?
Marisha: I was thinking that.
Matt: Instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area: terrain; bodies of water; prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples; powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead; influence from other planes of existence; or buildings.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Choose three of those.
Marisha: First and foremost, influences from other planes of existence.
Matt: Okay, so as you focus and Commune with Nature, the plants speak to you in this series of images and thoughts that essentially get the idea across to you that there is something planar involved here, but it's very old and long-dormant, recently awoken.
Marisha: Okay. Planar, long dormant.
Taliesin: Recently awoken.
Travis: If it's a fucking baby ancient dragon I'm going to be stoked.
Marisha: Okay, so something planar.
Liam: Didn't Drez Vina send us to a fetal thing?
Marisha: Yeah, that was our first fight.
Sam: Oh, we can't do how deep is the mine? No?
Marisha: No, I can, it's a terrain question, so terrain. Yeah. How deep does this mine go?
Laura: Maybe you can ask where the thing is in the mine.
Marisha: Is. I think I can, right? Can I sense the location of where--?
Matt: You can ask whereabouts this thing is.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Nature tells you this sinkhole goes down for about a quarter-mile, and it lies at the very bottom.
Laura: It's just straight down at the bottom of it?
Travis: That's 400 meters, y'all.
Ashley: So it's like this and then the little baby thing at the bottom?
Matt: Apparently, yeah. The whole ground just collapsed inward.
Marisha: 400 meters and the entity lies at the bottom.
Sam: We can just jump. We're like gods.
Marisha: Yeah, we're gods!
Taliesin: We're golden gods.
Marisha: It's only a little bit more than 1000 feet.
Laura: Yeah, then you might survive that one? Only if you turn into a goldfish and fall onto the ground. It's fine.
Marisha: Now I know Looney Tune physics doesn't work in this world.
Liam: Always go earth elemental.
Laura: Always Keyteor.
Marisha: Always Keyteor.
Sam: So what's our last question?
Travis: Something from another plane. We know it's 400 meters down.
Marisha: It lies at the bottom.
Taliesin: How many of these creatures are there?
Travis: Of the crawly ones?
Marisha: Ankhegs. Can I get a sense of how many and whereabouts the ankhegs are?
Matt: One of the two.
Laura: What are ankhegs? Are they fiends?
Liam: They're beasts, probably. They're big bugs.
Laura: Aberrations?
Marisha: How many?
Travis: Yeah, because if there's hundreds, then--
Marisha: That's a problem.
Taliesin: Then this is a stealth mission.
Matt: They are monstrosities, and that's what they look like right there.
All: Oh!
Taliesin: I love Starship Troopers. I'm excited.
Laura: We're about to fight some big, armored vaginas.
Marisha: About how many? Do I know about how many there are? Sensing their skittering movements under the surface.
Matt: Using the nature's essence to let you know somewhere in the neighborhood of about close to a hundred. Throughout the network of caves--
Marisha: Because this is a three-mile radius, right?
Matt: Yeah, so this is spread out amongst what would essentially be a subterranean anthill of these ankhegs.
Marisha: There's a lot.
Travis: We're going to need a fast exit. He wants us to take care of what the problem was.
Sam: We've just got to kill the big boss. One little baby big boss. The boss baby.
Laura: Did we understand correctly that it's the baby that cried out is the big monster? The big boss?
Matt: It seems to be the source of where all this started.
Laura: Okay. And that's the thing that woke up the skitterers?
Matt: Or at least brought them to start attacking the surface.
Laura: Okay. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't like, there's a big boss and then there's skitterers and then there's also little babies that cry out.
Matt: You don't know. This is all the information you have.
Ashley: But do we know why the baby woke up? What woke the baby?
Laura: No, we don't know what woke up the baby.
Ashley: We didn't ask that? Okay.
Laura: Maybe we should talk to another dead person.
Travis: Nah.
Sam: I don't think they'll know.
Taliesin: I don't think they'll know.
Laura: They're not miners.
Ashley: They did something in the mine that awoke it. And we can redo it.
Taliesin: I think anybody who was there who saw it probably died at the center of it.
Liam: Sorry, we're trying to remember the very first game of D&D we ever played and Keyleth, twins, Grog were there.
Matt: Yeah, that's right. That was what was essentially a dead or stillborn deity. A demigod, essentially, in its own pocket plane.
Marisha: So does it have anything to do with this?
Matt: Roll a religion check.
Marisha: No. I'm bad at this! (groans)
Liam: I'm religious!
Matt: Yeah, if you want to, whoever's having this conversation you can make a religion check.
Liam: Luck of the day. Yes!
Laura: Natural 20.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Laura: No, I haven't rolled. I'm trying to make myself roll it.
Liam: I got a 19.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my god I rolled a natural 20!
Marisha: Shut up!
Travis: She really did.
Laura: It's like Run Lola, Run where she's doing the roulette thing and she's like--
Matt: Okay. You recall a while back that you battled with that entity, you-- what was it called? Crysa-Thul.
Laura: How?
Matt: (sighs) This is all I do with my free time, guys. Make up shit for fun. But that was not tiny. That was a very large entity. Like, to the point where you remember there was a 20-foot-wide well and a giant fleshy baby arm that slapped out and crawled it out Akira-style. Everyone kept saying small on this one, so you don't know if-- maybe related in some way? But you're not entirely certain. It doesn't appear to be the same kind of thing, necessarily. Not by the descriptor you've heard.
Liam: Corpse called it a small one, right?
Matt: It called it a small one.
Travis: We're good. We've still got to camp for the night, right?
Laura: Yeah. We're camping. But we should camp in the trees, y'all. Not in the ground, in case the things come up out.
Matt: Yeah, the thick forest of Herethis surrounds the mine.
Laura: Oh man.
Marisha: Can I Druidcraft some web hammocks?
Taliesin: I mean you can, I mean we've gone to all this trouble, but if we want to add to it. I mean, this is just what we've been doing.
Marisha: Look, I really like elaborate tree houses.
Taliesin: No, I understand. I respect the art form.
Marisha: I can have a rope bridge here.
Liam: Hammock bed.
Matt: We'll say Druidcraft, which is a very localized and cantrip-based magic, you could, over the next couple hours craft a single web hammock. (groaning)
Matt: It's a cantrip, yo!
Marisha: I'll pass. We'll just sleep with the ones we have or whatever
Liam: A third-grade diorama.
Matt: Yeah. This is what it would look like if you were to build to scale. Okay. So you guys find a place in the trees? Who's helming finding that spot? All right. Go ahead and roll an investigation check.
Laura: 15?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh wait! I honestly don't know anymore what my favored terrain does for me.
Matt: No, this is exactly where to use it because forest is your favored terrain. This is exactly the kind of thing it would help with.
Laura: I always feel like I'm bullshitting it now. What am I rolling? Investigation?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: 24.
Matt: 24. You find one massive tree. The trees here can get pretty big, and there's one thick tree that the branches are pretty easy to climb, and up top it branches out and all the various branches that make up the canopy. It's almost like this little bowl at the very top, just underneath where the heavy foliage descends, and it's a perfect place for you guys to make a camp higher up off the ground.
Laura: Hey, this is a place! Let's do it here!
Taliesin: I'll unload everything.
Matt: All right, you guys make camp. Who's making first watch?
Travis: Me!
Laura: All right.
Liam: Me, too.
Ashley: Oh! Heroes' Feast.
Laura: Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: Heroes' Feast.
Matt: All right. We'll say as a note, this the last of the chalices you have prepared. If you want to do any more Heroes' Feasts, you'll have to specifically go and purchase the chalices or go look for it in town.
Liam: Let's do it!
Marisha: Is this including or not including the chalice that Grog gave to Vex earlier to drink out of?
Matt: That chalice, while it looks quite delightful, is not worth a thousand gold pieces.
Taliesin: It's from Medieval Times.
Matt: (laughs) It's a little gaudy.
Marisha: It's got Michael's. Michael's crafts.
Matt: Yeah, every time you drink from it you get glitter on your hands and you're like, shit.
Marisha: How do you turn it off? Cover it in blankets.
Laura: Yay, Heroes' Feast.
Sam: We're immune to fear?
Matt: You're immune to fear, immune to poison, and--
Laura: Advantage on wisdom.
Matt: Marisha, you want to go ahead and roll the additional hit points for Heroes' Feast?
Marisha: Yeah 2d10, yeah?
Matt: 2d10, I believe.
Laura: We're losing our 17?
Liam: Lose our 17 from the speech?
Matt: You do.
Travis: That's why I didn't take them.
Marisha: (gasps) Ooh! Wait, yeah! Ooh, that's amazing! It's a nine and a ten!
Matt: So 19 additional hit points to all of you guys.
Laura: If you give us a speech, how long does that last?
Matt: Temporary hit points last until they go down or you take a long rest, I believe. Let me double check.
Marisha: But this is going to be a long rest?
Laura: Oh wait, but does that mean we lose our temporary hit points on the Heroes' Feast?
Matt: Well, no. They're different. The Heroes' Feast is in addition to your maximum hit points. Temporary hit points are different. Technically, those two stack. You're about to lose the temporary hit points.
Marisha: But then at the top of the morning, I can give us another speech.
Matt: Should you be so inclined, yeah.
Laura: Tight.
Marisha: Do I have to do it?
Travis: No, you don't. You don't.
Marisha: Fuck you, Travis. Fuck you.
Matt: You can give the essence of a speech.
Marisha: Right, I can do an interpretive dance.
Travis: That's better.
Taliesin: Only if you actually do the interpretive dance.
Ashley: Wait, 19 extra?
Laura: He's giving you a look.
Marisha: A laser light show. With fireflies. It's like in a Disney Imagineer show.
Matt: It's a speech.
Marisha: All right, well, it's a speech.
Matt: You can give the essence of it, but the idea here is just you honing your public speaking skills.
Laura: You're going to get better at it, Keyleth.
Liam: It's like public debate in high school.
Sam: Toastmasters.
Taliesin: I love Toastmasters.
Matt: Temporary hit points. They last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest. Yes, I was correct. Cool.
Marisha: So in the top of the morning.
Laura: Top o' the mornin'!
Marisha: Top o' the mornin'!
Matt: All right. We'll say for the purpose of brevity, because even at your guys' level if you did encounter anything in this forest that was indigenous, you'd splatter it in a round. But you don't have any issues. Nothing really sees you up in the branches. You occasionally get caught off guard by the sound of a nearby (hooting). It's an owl in the trees. But nothing seems to bother you during your evening slumber. You complete your long rest. You still maintain your benefits from the Heroes' Feast, and as morning comes, Keyleth gives a rousing speech.
Sam: Just give us a topic.
Matt: You can just describe the topics you talk about. You don't have to give the actual speech.
Marisha: That's great, because one can only bullshit so much in a four-hour fucking game. I talk about the smell of our breakfast. It's bacon in the morning. And taste and smell the fleshy essence of the pork.
Taliesin: Is bacon what we're fighting for?
Marisha: No, bacon is definitely worth fighting for. Bacon is worth fighting for, and when we kill that celestial baby we will have the godliest bacon one could ever imagine.
Sam: I do like bacon.
Taliesin: This is the most Burning Man thing that's ever happened on this show. I'm flashing back.
Matt: Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest.
Taliesin: Bacon. Speech.
Matt: All right, guys. There you go. Take your 17 temporary hit points.
Marisha: She's not a great talker and has never been one. Just want to point that out. You guys all know this.
Matt: No, it's just her level.
Laura: Just add that to the 19 then?
Matt: No, because the 17, once the 17 goes it's gone.
Laura: But the 19 we can heal to?
Matt: It's still your maximum. You can heal to it, yeah. That is the difference.
Taliesin: I always imagine occasionally Keyleth gives a speech that's like what's-his-name from Animal House.
Sam: Matthew, I'm going to prepare some spells that I'm going to inject into various coins.
Matt: Yes, what are you doing?
Sam: I'm going to drop another 300 gold and give Vex another Revivify.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Grog, you're already a good jumper, right?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: How far can you jump?
Travis: You gave me a Fly coin.
Sam: No, that's gone forever. That's gone. It doesn't last forever. It lasts a couple hours.
Travis: Well, that's bullshit. Yeah, I can jump 15 feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally. So not great. Like three squares.
Sam: I'll give you a Jump coin, so that will triple your jump.
Travis: Will you sing "Jump" from Van Halen?
Sam: Sure. When you do it. Let's see here. Who needs things?
Ashley: (singing) Jump! For my love.
Sam: Oh no, you guys all cast things now, right?
Taliesin: Not really, why?
Liam: T., give me something! Show me some magic. Give me a doodad.
Sam: Can you turn invisible?
Liam: I used to be able to, but I--
Sam: You gave away your ring.
Laura: Kerr bear. Oh no, it wasn't Kerr bear. It was Tova.
Sam: I'll give you a Blur coin.
Laura: Don't you already have that with your--
Liam: That cloak that I gave away?
Laura: Oh yeah, that one.
Marisha: That's the one that Kerr bear took.
Liam: That's right.
Laura: That's right.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs) The inventory of the items you've lost to guests.
Liam: Lost? Gave away.
Matt: Lost and gave away.
Sam: I'll give good old Percival a Cure Wounds coin.
Matt: What level?
Sam: Just one.
Matt: Level one. You got it.
Taliesin: Yeah. It will hopefully not come in handy.
Sam: And also I'm going to change my Robe of Many Things to my new Robe of Many Things.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And that's it.
Taliesin: A Vest of Several Items now.
Matt: (laughs) The Kigurumi of Useful Trinkets.
Laura: Oh, hey. Well, no. Maybe would this be a bad idea? To shoot an Oracle Arrow down into the bottom?
Taliesin: I think that's been working out very well for us. It is pitch black down there, though, isn't it?
Laura: Well. We have this method that we used to do. Light the arrow on fire, and then send it down. So I can see by the light of the fire on it.
Liam: Would that make your actual eyeballs burn?
Laura: I don't think so.
Sam: Oh! And I'm going to do one more thing. I'm going to pull out a healing draught bottle, and give it to-- no, you can heal things.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm all right.
Sam: You don't need to heal.
Travis: Other people, I normally do.
Sam: I give it to Vax.
Travis: I turn into Nurse Betty almost in every fight. What are you talking about?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's actually true.
Laura: That's true, he does. He does heal people a lot.
Travis: But that's cool, you give it to somebody that, you know--
Liam: Well, he can give it to me. I've got 50 things I can do a turn. It was what kind of potion?
Sam: A healing draught. It's not a potion; it's a bottle of healing shit.
Liam: Oh shit.
Sam: It's 8d8.
Ashley: 8d8?!
Liam: 8d8?!
Liam: I will never give this up. Ever. Thank you. Thank you, Taryon.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: I think that that's a really good idea, shooting an arrow down there.
Liam: I'm going to set the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic.
Marisha: I'll light my hands on fire so that Vex can light her arrows on fire.
Taliesin: So when we're ready we've got something to light the--
Laura: Wait, should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us? No, I'm going to do the Oracle Arrow first. Oh. What if we wake it up when I shoot it down and things come out?
Liam: Well, that is a very real possibility.
Taliesin: Well, then they'll be easier to kill up here than they will be down there.
Marisha: They'll be 400 meters down. I could theoretically drop some awesome Fireballs on their face, potentially.
Laura: I like this idea. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, just to be safe. So we can stealth and be quiet. Yeah, but they'll just keep falling, won't they?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: How does that work?
Marisha: That's a weird magic question.
Taliesin: This is why magic freaks me out.
Matt: What's the question?
Marisha: If I drop a Fireball, how long it'll go--
Liam: Does gravity continue to carry it down?
Matt: Drop a what? A Fireball?
Taliesin: Fire a Fireball into the abyss. Will it just eventually stop?
Marisha: Will it keep going?
Matt: Well, a Fireball is a small bead of magic energy that has a range. So if it reaches the end of the range, it has no effect.
Taliesin: This is why magic's weird.
Marisha: But I could Keyteor to the bottom.
Matt: You could.
Travis: We're just spoiled for choice.
Matt: You take half bludgeoning damage when you impact.
Marisha: Yep, advantages to both.
Liam: Dropping a great height did not go well for you.
Travis: Keyleth, did you roll 17 or 19 on your--
Marisha: I rolled 19, but then you get an additional 17 because my weird speech about bacon.
Matt: Bacon points. 17 bacon points.
Laura: It will make the most glorious bacon!
Matt: To be fair, I've eaten some bacon in my time that's given me some temporary hit points. Just saying.
Marisha: Look, it was inspired, okay?
Matt: Oh, completely.
Marisha: I'm not wrong.
Liam: We will not go bacon-less into the night.
Marisha: Bacon has saved many a people.
Laura: All right. I'm setting my arrow on fire, and I'm shooting it down into the pit.
Matt: Okay. Oracle Arrow. You fire it. It's a big pit. The radius of a small flame on an arrow doesn't seem to light up the walls. It's not bright enough, so it just descends and descends, and the wood is catching and burning, and eventually it hits the stony, earthy floor at the bottom (arrow impact) and it clatters and breaks a little bit. It's burning pretty heavily, and you glance around the space inside and you can see what looks like some broken mining equipment on the ground, jutting out in places. You see what appears to be some sort of stony platform that is carved, but mildly forgotten or eroded steps, and the rest of the arrow burns up and you lose your vision.
Laura: That was helpful. Super helpful.
Taliesin: Worth it. It was worth it. It didn't cost us anything.
Laura: That's true. I didn't see the great baby beast down at the bottom.
Taliesin: And that's information we didn't have. And now we know. Great baby beast is not at the bottom--
Laura: Potentially. In that small circle.
Taliesin: It's not at the bottom of the topless pit.
Laura: Okay, so we could take the flying carpet down. A couple of people could fly. We can take the flying carpet down.
Taliesin: Two flyers, plus the carpet.
Travis: The circumference of this thing is massive. The diameter.
Matt: Well, the diameter of the actual hole is maybe about--
Travis: Football field?
Matt: Not quite that big. I'd say it's about 150, 200 feet across?
Travis: Stay away from the walls.
Laura: You think? The skitterers are going to come out of the walls?
Travis: Yeah, do not come anywhere near the walls.
Sam: When we descend, do we want light to be able to see? Or we don't want things to see us?
Liam: Good chance they can see in the dark.
Taliesin: Let's have the flashlights ready, but not activated.
Marisha: I mean, I have a few Daylight spells.
Laura: It may be good to blind them if they dwell under the surface.
Travis: You know, if we're not in a rush-- (deeper) if we're not in a rush, it might just be nice to send a little mini nuke down into the hole and see what comes out.
Taliesin: Did your voice just crack?
Travis: Yeah, no, it's like reverse puberty.
Taliesin: Becoming a man? Okay.
Marisha: I'm down with that mini nuke. It extends a lot of our magical ranges, unless I want to Keyteor down.
Taliesin: I think it's better, especially-- have we seen a tree that we can port to in case of an emergency? Or some sort of object that we can port to?
Marisha: There are definitely a lot of trees, yeah.
Taliesin: But there will not be a tree down there.
Laura: No.
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Do we have an escape route if we need it?
Laura: We have a flying carpet, two brooms, a set of wings. Up and out.
Taliesin: Well, all right.
Travis: Just a reminder that I can't ride the carpet.
Laura: Yes, you can.
Liam: It's a big one.
Travis: Is it? Is it bigger than the first one?
Taliesin: Yeah, it's bigger than the first one.
Travis: So I can get on there with everybody else?
Laura: The only people we need to get on it are Percy and Pike. Everybody else can fly. Unless Keyleth is out of--
Marisha: Well, I can Polymorph him.
Taliesin: How much weight can the carpet take?
Ashley: I mean, you could technically just go on it alone and I could--
Laura: Hop on the broom.
Liam: We are versatile as shit.
Ashley: Hop on Vax's back.
Matt: Okay, the flying carpet, the one that you have? 800 pound capacity.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: It's you, right?
Taliesin: You're 300 pounds, right?
Travis: No, I'm... it's arguable. I'm definitely over 300.
Taliesin: Okay, so three of us on that carpet  one big one, one little one, and a medium.
Matt: You can fit Grog and one other person.
Travis: He's a big bastard.
Sam: We can take someone on a broom.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'll join you on the broom.
Laura: All right.
Matt: I think you could probably fit Grog, Percy, and Pike.
Taliesin: Yeah, okay then. That solves it.
Sam: Well, then let's descend slowly and quietly? Is that what we're doing?
Marisha: Hang on. Before we go, there's a few things I want to do. Let me double-check-- I don't want to be a dumbass.
Taliesin: No, this is very clever. I see what you're going for.
Marisha: Hang on. Wait. I might need the book. Okay, one of the things I want to do is I want to use my staff to create an air elemental? So I want to take a minute to use my Spire to conjure an air elemental.
Matt: Conjure an air elemental.
Sam: By the way, can I just remind everyone, this whole year I've had one half of a communications bracelet and someone's been watching us the whole time.
Travis: What?
Sam: Remember that thing I found?
Laura: Because you got that down in the fucking Nine Hells, right?
Sam: Yeah. Someone's watching us. For a year.
Taliesin: Oh my god, they're right there.
Laura: That is so crazy.
Marisha: What?
Travis: Yeah, watching you make fucking blondies. All right, this channel's boring.
Taliesin: The blondie channel.
Travis: He's making armor. Ugh.
Liam: (guttural, growly) I want a blondie so bad!
Marisha: I'm going to conjure an air elemental, and then I'm going to go over to Grog and I'm going to give him a big hug and say, for the next hour, no one can keep a hold of you. And I'm going to give him Freedom of Movement.
Travis: What is that?
Taliesin: Target should now spend five feet of movement to automatically escape from non-magical restraints such as manacles or creatures that have grapple.
Marisha: You can't be grappled.
Travis: So I just spend five feet of my movement?
Marisha: You're also unaffected by difficult terrain. And spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.
Taliesin: You are parkour.
Marisha: You're parkour.
Travis: I'm Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation.
Marisha: Because I feel like you've been restrained a lot.
Matt: As you finish the conjuration with the staff and slam it into the ground at the edge of the entranceway, you watch as a nearby cloud starts to swirl and descend, and you hear this cracking sound as the planar shift between your plane and the Elemental Plane of Air briefly hiccups open and then summons forth an air elemental that (whoosh) rushes down under your control. It is concentration. Keep that in mind.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Let's go.
Travis: Do it.
Matt: So. Two brooms of flying, magic carpet, wings.
Laura: (singing) And a partridge in a pear tree.
Taliesin: (singing) And a partridge in a pear tree.
Matt: And you are...
Marisha: I know. I'm wondering if I should ahead and go elemental, but I can't cast. Can I get on the carpet? Is there room?
Matt: The carpet's full.
Taliesin: I'll hop on the broom. You hop on the carpet.
Matt: Okay, we can do that. All right, so you guys slowly begin to descend down this heavy, open tunnel.
Laura: This is just the stupidest. We're sticking to the middle.
Marisha: Did you cast Pass Without a Trace?
Matt: Yes. So I would like all you guys to make a stealth check, please.
Travis: Natural 20.
Laura: Oh shit! Flying carpet! Ooh, shit, and add ten, y'all.
Taliesin: 27.
Sam: 21.
Liam: I rolled a two, but it's a 37.
Ashley: That's ridiculous.
Laura: 39.
Liam: Built into the rules, man!
Matt: Yep, reliable rogues, man. That's what rogues are good at.
Marisha: 37.
Ashley: 28!
Travis: 30.
Matt: 30, okay! As you guys all descend, you get about halfway down the tunnel, and you can hear this occasional echo (clicking). And for those of you that have Darkvision, you look off to the side and you see there are these small openings, these tunnels in the sides, and occasionally you see a large insect-like creature skitter out (clicking) and then into another hole. None seem to see or notice your presence. You continue delving deeper and deeper and deeper. Looking up above, you can see the slowly vanishing circle of daylight above you, and as you continue further and further down, those of you with Darkvision, you begin to see a floor begin to approach.
Sam: Don't land?
Laura: Don't land.
Sam: Do we need light?
Travis: No, not yet. I halt the carpet 20 feet off the ground.
Matt: Okay. You halt the carpet.
Laura: And we're whispering. We're whispering, but we're not whispering so that people can hear. We're definitely whispering over--
Ashley: Can we see any little creature in the middle of anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can I look, too?
Sam: I have some sort of a cloak over my helm, since it emits light always.
Matt: Okay. It doesn't block all the light because it's the Helm of Brilliance. As you guys are being somewhat stealthy going down here, Taryon is still a slight beacon of fire. His helmet just emits a glow at all times.
Travis: Cool. Because insects don't love lights in the dark.
Marisha: I know.
Ashley: 25 for perception.
Laura: 22.
Matt: Okay. You glance about and you can see this opening at the bottom. There's some warping to the earth here. It's one large chamber that's almost peanut-shaped, it pinches in the center and closes around, and there's a small tunnel that leads off and then closes at the end. It appears to be what may have been some sort of mine shaft that has then collapsed on the opposite side, but the center here looks like there's some fallen barrels and chest pieces, and there are pieces of rods and rope and cords strewn about. And there's this ancient stone platform that rises up in the center, and what appears to be some sort of a small recess in the stonework there. It looks like it's the size of a football carved downward.
Sam: I was wrong. It only emits light when there's undead around.
Matt: Oh.
Laura: Is it emitting light? Is it like an orc?
Matt: It is currently not emitting light.
Laura: Should we just nuke it? Should we just nuke that thing?
Travis: The ancient platform? No, don't do that.
Laura: Oh, it was like a coffin. Does it look like a coffin?
Matt: You could probably get closer.
Taliesin: Let's get a little closer.
Laura: A teeny bit.
Matt: Okay. Because you're a ways from it and you have no light down here. Even with your Darkvision, you can make out some details. The closer you get, you see a number of small carvings in what looks like some sort of language that I don't believe you understand.
Taliesin: Celestial?
Matt: You don't see it. It's pitch-black for you, Mr. Human.
Laura: Abyssal? Draconic?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: Primordial?
Matt: Nope.
Travis: Common.
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: That would be amazing.
Ashley: Dwarvish. Gnomish.
Matt: Nope.
Travis: Giant?
Laura: Yeah, they're human. They can't see shit.
Matt: The humans are sitting there in pitch black, seeing this tiny little bead of light above and just hoping that someone's going to give them some indicator.
Laura: Should we cast some light down here?
Sam: Sure. We said that we had prepared our flashlights before, didn't we?
Taliesin: Oh, we have that low-light version! We have the red-light version of it.
Sam: Yes, we do. I'm going to mark off two of these.
Liam: I can get around very fast. Why don't I go look?
Sam: You want to borrow a flashlight?
Liam: I have a flashlight.
Taliesin: You don't speak Celestial.
Marisha: I can also just cast Daylight, by the by.
Sam: Well, that's what we have going in our flashlights, are Daylight spells.
Taliesin: Except they're lensed and contained.
Matt: It's contained, but it's still a single beam.
Taliesin: A beam of red light.
Matt: So you go ahead and get close on the broom.
Taliesin: And just start to see if I can make out what it is.
Matt: Right. You open up the hood of the light, and it immediately beams this stark red beam down on this portion, and you look at it. It is Celestial.
Taliesin: What does it say?
Matt: It appears to be runes of gestation and protection. It speaks of a seed, a guardian for ages to come: Symphior.
All: Symphior.
Taliesin: It's an incubator. This isn't a coffin. It hatched.
Ashley: So this is the opening of-- this is where it was.
Liam: Is it a guard cherub?
Matt: You notice as this pale white light begins to slowly appear a little ways ahead of you in the other side of the chamber. This light is emanating from some--
Taliesin: I snuff. The second.
Laura: And we back away from the thing.
Matt: You guys begin to drift back on the carpet, and you see this beacon of light hovering maybe ten feet up off the ground, about the same height that you guys were to the platform. And you see there what appears to be a cherub. It's a baby, or an infant, but it appears to be withered and gray, and its arms and legs hang limply, and it has these small, white angel-like wings, but the feathers are tattered and broken in places, and the head's lolled back, and as the glow grows from it, it goes (wheezes, screams) and gives out this heinous scream that echoes throughout the whole hall. You can't help but instinctually grab your ears. I would like you all to make a wisdom saving throw, please.
Laura: Advantage on!
Matt: Which, actually, you are immune to fear, so it does not affect you. However, it shakes the interior and you watch as small stones (thud) hitting the ground around you. You guys, looking up above, you can see that this scream is affecting the structure a little bit. I need you all to roll initiative.
Marisha: Oh, that's good!
Sam: Oh, that sucks.
Laura: Oh shit.
Matt: So we have, up here by the platform.
Liam: I rolled a 20 on the wisdom save we didn't need to make, and threw it away, and thought, "well, I wanted to keep it," and then I rolled again and I got another natural 20.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Sam: Whoa, look at that! There's a map.
Laura: Wow, it's cool-looking! Oh shit, we're right by the baby.
Liam: Where's the baby?
Matt: There it is.
Laura: Oh, that's the baby?
Matt: It's very tiny.
Laura: Oh, it's a mean baby. I feel like it could be saved, because it's--
Liam: When you say saved, do you mean killed?
Laura: I feel bad because it's a baby.
Matt: All right. Initiatives. 25 to 20, anybody?
Liam: 25.
Marisha: Holy shit.
Matt: Who rolled what?
Taliesin: 30.
Matt: Jesus Christ, Percy.
Liam: So what did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a 19, and my initiative is 11.
Ashley: Jeez.
Liam: Wow.
Taliesin: I am going to debate hard how dumb I'm about to be.
Liam: The dumbest.
Matt: All right. So 20 to 15.
Ashley: 20.
Marisha: 19.
Ashley: What did you get?
Liam: 25.
Ashley: You got a 25, okay.
Matt: All right. 15 to 10?
Laura: 12.
Matt: Ten to five.
Sam: Oh yeah.
Travis: Eight.
Sam: Six.
Matt: All righty. All right, guys, we're going to keep this coming at everyone fast, because we're going to make this happen. All right, first and foremost, as this creature emerges and you guys are in your respective places, Percival, you're up first.
Taliesin: Where am I?
Matt: You're up here near the top of the platform, where you saw the recess.
Taliesin: Goddamn it! Okay, so I'm far away from that little bugger, aren't I?
Matt: Yeah, it appeared on the opposite side of this double chamber. It's all up from there.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to hop off the broom.
Matt: Okay. So you hop off of there.
Taliesin: Actually, no. You're going to move towards it, I assume?
Laura: I'm so far below you in the initiative, though.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fair.
Sam: It's glowing, right, so we can see it even if we don't turn on flashlights and things?
Matt: You can see it, yes, but you cannot see the terrain around you.
Travis: I'm sure we're going to try and talk to it, right?
Sam: Yeah. Maybe it knows my family's name.
Matt: So Percival, what are you doing?
Taliesin: I'm going to hop off the broom, activate my boots and activate my gloves, and start running through that little choke point, and I'm going to get as close to and possibly on the wall of that choke point as humanly possible. The other side of the choke point.
Matt: Oh, this side? You can get about there. You don't quite get to the wall.
Taliesin: Okay. I can get about there?
Matt: You can get further, but currently the creature is out of your view.
Taliesin: That's fine. That's as far as I can get right now. That will be just fine. The gloves are charged, the boots are on, and I'm heading towards the wall.
Matt: Okay. That's your turn?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: All right. Vax?
Liam: Okay. Boots on, I'm going to arc over to ten feet away from the baby.
Matt: All right. About there?
Liam: Yeah. Where I am, is it straight up, or am I covered over here?
Matt: It's straight up. Where you see the walls are right now, even this is collapsed about here. In fact, I'd say, to keep it easier, I'll say that's a collapsed entrance there. But this is all a straight-up hole in the ground. It slowly funnels as it gets to the bottom.
Laura: Whoa.
Liam: All right. So action, action, bonus action. I'm going to cast Vow of Enmity on it.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: Then I'm going to throw Whisper at it.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: That is a 33 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: I'm going to cast Divine Smite on it.
Laura: Good job! Kill that celestial baby!
Liam: There's a lot of dice here.
Laura: Get all the bacon!
Liam: This is ten, plus psychic damage is 11. That's not very good. 11 plus Divine Smite is 12, 19, plus sneak attack damage. 19, 21, 26, 28, 29, 34, 36, 38. And there's nothing extra because it's celestial, not a fiend.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: All right. So that was bonus action, action, I'm going to use my action to then just fly away from the fucking thing, a hundred feet away diagonally up into the tunnel where I can still see it, hopefully. I'm hasted.
Matt: Right.
Liam: Movement was to get there. Bonus action for Vow of Enmity. Action to attack, and then my hasted action I can use for dash, hide, disengage.
Matt: Correct. Dash is your full movement, which is--
Liam: 60 normally, 120 feet hasted. I didn't make these rules or these items. (whoosh)
Matt: Cool.
Liam: Diagonally up. I'll fly by my sister, how's that?
Matt: You fly by your sister? Okay. No worries. That ends your turn. All right. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope.
Matt: Actually, sorry. Before the end of your turn, it's going to go ahead and use a legendary action to use a terrain shift.
Travis: But it's just a baby!
Laura: Oh no! We're in its lair!
Matt: Yep. As you stab the creature, it (gasps). There's a horrible sucking sound as you dart back. It looks over in your direction. The wings flutter once and it brings its arms up, and as it does and you land next to your sister, you feel the air around you begin to freeze in cold. This energy's just (crackling). You feel ice crystals condense around, and both of you feel the air in your lungs suddenly begin to freeze up. I need both of you guys to make constitution saving throws.
Laura: Thanks for coming right next to me on that one. Goddamn it.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Nice!
Laura: What am I doing, a constitution?
Matt: Constitution saving throw.
Laura: Nine.
Matt: All righty. 19 points of cold damage to you, Vex, and that is nine points of cold damage to you, Vax. And while you manage to pull out of this space of condensed cold, Vax, your sister, however, becomes stunned for one round as your body is frozen and locked in place.
Sam: Do we see any of this happen?
Matt: You watch the air coalesce into this frozen area, and while the broom is still holding you aloft, thankfully, you are standing there in place and the ice falls, clatters, and slams into the ground below you, sounding like the shattering of a hundred pieces of crystal across the stonework. Pike, now it's your turn.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope. And for my bonus action, I'm going to pull out a spiritual weapon of a giant big greatsword.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: A giant baby rattle that's directly in front of it.
Travis: Don't fight, play with this.
Matt: It's a level two spiritual weapon. Where are you putting the spiritual weapon?
Ashley: Right in front of the baby!
Matt: All right. I believe you get to make an attack with it, then, if you do.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: All right. So.
Ashley: Oh, but I don't know if I want to hurt the baby. Did you do any damage?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Once again, roll for attack on that.
Ashley: Oh, that's not very good.
Matt: So you roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.
Ashley: 13.
Matt: 13. (whoosh) It swings, and the creature flaps out of the way and avoids the blow.
Ashley: Stupid piece of dice crap.
Matt: Are you going to move or stay where you are?
Laura: Oh yeah! I'm resistant to cold, Travis just reminded me! I have cold resistance because of my Vorugal armor.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Does that mean I roll again for--
Matt: No, you take half the damage, but you're still stunned.
Laura: Oh, okay. So that was 17?
Matt: You would take nine damage instead of the 19.
Liam: Nine instead of 18 is what you would've taken for it.
Laura: Okay, so add nine back.
Matt: So do you want to move with your turn?
Ashley: No, I'm going to stay.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I'm going to stay. Because we're on the carpet, right? Grog, Percy, and I on the carpet?
Taliesin: I'm not on the carpet.
Ashley: You're not on the carpet anymore? Oh, the three of us. I'm going to stay on the carpet.
Taliesin: You can move the carpet forward, though.
Laura: Did Beacon of Hope get everybody?
Matt: Beacon of Hope. The range on that is 30 feet. 30-foot range gets everybody except for the elemental.
Marisha: That's cool.
Taliesin: What do we get?
Matt: Beacon of Hope, you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, death saving throws, and you regain the max number of hit points possible from any healing.
Marisha: Sick.
Matt: All righty. That end your turn?
Ashley: Yes.
Laura: Death saving throw is huge. And healing is huge.
Matt: At the end of your turn, the creature goes (raspy breathing) and you watch as the ground right beneath the carpet explodes. It peels back as molten lava suddenly begins to spill up in a column beneath you, splattering up and to the back and over the top of the carpet. I need everybody in this cluster, this ten-foot-by-ten-foot section, to make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Not good, but maybe I'm lucky. Oh, am I not in that? Where am I?
Taliesin: You're over on the corner.
Sam: I have no idea where I am.
Laura: You're next to the big white thing.
Sam: I am?
Matt: So Grog, Pike, and Keyleth.
Sam: Oh, well then, never mind.
Travis: Danger sense 18.
Matt: Danger sense 18.
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: Natural 20.
Matt: Natural 20 plus, what's your--
Ashley: One! 21!
Matt: Pike's the only one who made it.
Ashley: What?
Matt: Pike, you suffer 21 points of fire damage, halved because of your armor, so you only take ten. Ten points of fire damage.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: I need you to go ahead and make a concentration check on Beacon of Hope.
Laura: You got this. You got this, Pike.
Matt: Just roll a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Fucking molten lava!
Matt: Keyleth and Grog, you guys both take 42 points of fire damage.
Travis: Oh, it was nice being over 250 for a little while.
Ashley: Fucking fuck.
Matt: The ground below you right now is currently in flames, and you guys have to stick around that space there. The open ground is billowing flame and lava now, and the area around that platform is searing hot. So what did you roll?
Ashley: Five.
Matt: A five with your--
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: Yeah. You lose Beacon of Hope. Sorry.
Laura: What is it? You have to get above half of the damage you took, is that what it is?
Matt: You have to get above half the damage you took or ten, whichever is higher.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Do we stay on the carpet or are we knocked off?
Matt: You guys can choose to stay on the carpet. You pull out of the way, and now the area is just billowing with lava and flame. Keyleth, it's your turn.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to take and control my air elemental and send him over.
Matt: All right. You took how much damage? 42?
Marisha: 42.
Matt: Make a concentration check. Constitution saving throw.
Marisha: So I have to get over-- I have advantage on these.
Matt: Yes. You have to get over a 21.
Sam: Over a 21!
Matt: A 21 or over.
Marisha: What's 17 plus four?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21. You just maintain concentration.
Laura: Good roll!
Marisha: Thank you, Gil! All right. So (boom) I send him over with my staff. It has 90-feet fly speed.
Matt: 90-feet flying speed? Yeah, he gets over there easy. Plops on over.
Marisha: And he's going to go ahead and do a Whirlwind. The creatures in his space have to make a DC 13 strength saving throw.
Matt: Okay. Nope. This is not a very strong creature.
Marisha: That's what I hoped. They take 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Go ahead and roll the damage on that, yeah.
Marisha: Oh, that's nasty. 12 plus seven is 19 plus two, so 21. And they are flung up to 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked prone.
Matt: Random direction, I'll roll for that. Okay. That's going to fling him 20 feet into the five, ten, 15, 20 into the wall right there, and prone.
Marisha: And are knocked prone.
Liam: Stupid baby.
Marisha: Do I still have line of sight?
Matt: To it right now, no. You would have to get off the carpet to go.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to get off the carpet and walk over just to where I have line of sight.
Matt: Okay. At the top of your turn, by the way, you suffer eight points of fire damage by the proximity to the flaming platform there.
Marisha: Even though my mantle allows me to ignore the penalties of dangerous weather effects?
Matt: It's not so much a weather effect. It's more that there's a heaping column of molten rock.
Travis: Your old friend, molten lava.
Matt: Eight points of fire damage. And I need you to make another concentration check.
Sam: Oh no, another concentration check!
Marisha: I'm a warcaster, though, man! Because that's eight, so I just have to get over a ten, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: What is this considered, Underdark, or a dungeon?
Marisha: Rolled a 13.
Matt: This is considered subterranean, not Underdark. Cavern. All right, so you've done that. What do you want to do, Keyleth? You're over here.
Marisha: Okay. Can I move over to where I have line of sight?
Matt: Yeah, so you leap over and you get line of sight on him right there.
Marisha: Okay, can I do Blight?
Matt: Sure. What's the DC on that?
Marisha: I think my spell level, so 20.
Matt: And it's a constitution saving throw, I believe?
Marisha: 8d8.
Matt: Six plus ten, so it's a 16.
Marisha: No, fail.
Matt: Yeah. So roll your 8d8 necrotic damage.
Laura: Get it!
Matt: Yeah, no. Even with advantage on the save, it rolled a six and a four.
Marisha: One, two, three, four. Give me two more. One more, and another.
Taliesin: I don't know if I have another.
Marisha: Give me a d8. Okay.
Taliesin: And you reroll ones, right?
Marisha: No, on elementals. Four, five, nine, 14, plus eight is 22, plus four is 26, plus two is 28. 28 Blight damage.
Matt: Nice. As you reach, it's on the ground. It's trying to get back up, and its wings are flapping, and all of a sudden you watch as its gray, withered skin turns dark black on one half of its body and it (screech) shrieks out and gives another scream (hoarse scream) from the ground, and the area quakes again, and you feel the ground shimmy a bit. The ground beneath you, as its last legendary action, begins to give way. Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Marisha: Fucking lava!
Taliesin: Didn't you move? Wait, no, you moved, didn't you?
Matt: Yeah, this is a different area.
Marisha: That's not bad. 19. No, 18?
Matt: Nope. So as you finish casting this and you hear it scream, you cover your ears, and suddenly the ground moves out beneath you. You watch as the actual floor (whoosh).
Marisha: I turn to everyone behind me and I go, aw, fuck!
Matt: As you watch Keyleth plummet into a pit below. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage and the ground (whoosh) covers over her.
Marisha: It's fine.
Matt: Keyleth vanishes. The ground seems to swallow her up. Keyleth, the entire pit collapses in on you, and you're currently restrained underground, and you cannot breathe.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: That's fixable.
Sam: But can you cast things while you can't move?
Matt: I need you to make another concentration check.
Marisha: On my elemental?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Yeah, 13 plus my constitution, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm good.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Keyleth?
Travis: Matt, can you point to where the cherub is?
Matt: I am, because it's his turn. The cherub creature, this Symphior, begins to fly up off the ground and make its way back in this direction, out into the open once more.
Liam: Keeps everyone from getting a good night's sleep.
Laura: He needs a nap.
Ashley: He has a dirty diaper. He's mad.
Liam: It's been a thousand years!
Matt: As it floats upward, it looks over towards where-- let's see, because all it sees is you two. You both are still in the flames right there. It's not worried about the fire at the moment. It sees you, Taryon, and goes (hoarse wheezing) and lifts its hands up. I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: I'm feeling lucky. Natural 20! Plus one.
Matt: That's great. So you only suffer 11 points of piercing damage.
Sam: Hey, that's not bad.
Matt: As you leap out of the way, you watch as the ground suddenly turns into a series of earthlike spikes underneath, and some pierce you and scratch you and you roll out of the way. You barely move off to the side, where now you see this giant, jutting series of spike-like pillars forcing up from the ground. All right, that's going to end that attack, and it's going to use the rest of its movement to move back (whoosh) over to there in the corner. That brings us back to Vex. It's your turn now.
Laura: Yeah, I'm frozen.
Matt: Yeah, so you're stunned, and that's your turn.
Laura: Yay.
Matt: You eventually break the ice off at the end of your turn, and you're breathing heavily and trying to get the feeling back in your skin. That's your go. Grog, you're up.
Travis: What does it take to activate the coin?
Sam: You have to slap it on yourself.
Matt: It's an action.
Travis: Yeah? Just an action?
Matt: Which spell do you have?
Travis: It's the Jump coin, three times my--
Matt: What's the casting time of Jump?
Sam: It's touch.
Matt: What's the casting time of Jump?
Sam: It lasts a minute. It's instantaneous. You just touch, right?
Taliesin: No, is it a bonus action?
Matt: So that would be your action to use it on yourself.
Travis: Oh, damn. It's that whole shit, yo. All right. (grunts) I'm going to jump! And I would like to rage as my bonus action. And with my new Jump coin, I would like to jump with my Boots of Feral Leaping. It's three times my horizontal jump speed, which is 20 feet, so 60 feet.
Matt: Okay. You also take seven points of fire damage at the start of your turn, because you're by this flame.
Travis: Oh, got it. Nice, that's fine. And can I jump towards the baby? Actually just to the right of the-- just over here.
Matt: Over to this side there?
Travis: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Okay, yeah. You run (whoosh, thud) land next to it.
Travis: Nice. Do I have any movement left?
Matt: With the run and the jump, you have maybe ten feet.
Travis: Okay. I want to get right up on him.
Matt: Yeah, you're right up on him.
Travis: Never mind. I'm good. Rage, jump, no more action. Titanstone Knuckles? Next round. Okay.
Matt: You have an action, still.
Travis: Oh, I do?
Matt: Well, no, because you said it's a bonus action to do the leap? What's it say on that? Just to do the leap, right? It was the run. You still have an action.
Travis: I want to hit him.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Great weapon master, reckless attack.
Matt: Okay!
Travis: That's a 26.
Matt: 26 with the minus five? Yeah, that hits.
Travis: Nice. 12. Where are you? I should have gotten this beforehand. Nice! Plus ten. 37.
Matt: All righty. That's your first strike.
Travis: Oh, I get another one!
Matt: You have extra attack, man!
Travis: 11, 24.
Matt: 24 does not hit. It's a tiny size. It's hard to swing at, and as your axe almost catches it, it (whoosh) out of the way.
Travis: Okay. Good to know. I whiff. That's it. I just have the two.
Matt: Yep, that's your turn. At the end of your turn, because it's reset back to its ground, it's going to go ahead and look to you in front of it and go (hoarse breathing). Make a dexterity check.
Travis: Okay. Saving throw or just dexterity?
Matt: Dexterity saving throw, sorry.
Travis: I get two of those. That's better. 19.
Matt: The ground crumbles beneath you and you suddenly (whoosh) fall below. You are raging. It would've been 12 points of bludgeoning damage, but it becomes six. But you are suddenly buried and restrained underground.
Liam: Got that slick stuff on you? Crisco oil?
Travis: But that's my next turn. That happens on my turn.
Taliesin: Yeah, you burn five feet of movement to get out of it.
Travis: Can I get out of it if I'm buried in soil, though?
Matt: Freedom of Movement. I'll say it doesn't have--
Marisha: That's why I cast it on him, man.
Taliesin: You parkour around the rocks as they try and--
Matt: Well, he's buried in the ground, regardless. That's the effect. He didn't avoid the burying. So I guess you'd just, if you want to use your action to try to escape, you do so.
Laura: You could enlarge, maybe. You can enlarge and come up out of it.
Matt: All right. That ends that go. Taryon, you're up.
Sam: Me? Oh god. All right. I don't have anything I can do. I will click my Boots of Speed, making me faster, and then I will move. Full movement of 60 feet towards him-- or her. We don't know, do we?
Laura: Is it wearing a diaper, or is its dangly bits hanging out?
Liam: Is a peeper hanging out?
Sam: Is it naked?
Matt: You've got a pretty close look, if you wanted to take a moment to inspect.
Liam: It's a boy!
Sam: We're trying to kill this thing, yeah?
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: I guess I'll punch a baby. It's going to miss, though. That's a slippery baby, right?
Matt: At 60 feet of movement, you're not quite within melee range of it.
Sam: No, I was going to use my Ring of the Ram.
Matt: Oh, that'll do.
Sam: But I'm probably not going to hit, because it's got an amazing AC.
Liam: Got any Luck left?
Sam: Yeah, I do.
Taliesin: See what happens.
Liam: Got to do something.
Sam: Is this going to be a long fight? I'll do all three charges of the Ring of the Ram, and punch a baby.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Sam: Eight. Not good enough, I'll use Luck. 13 plus nine? 22.
Ashley: Wait! Can I War God's Blessing?
Matt: What's the range on War God's Blessing?
Ashley: Let's see. 30 feet?
Matt: No, he's out of range for that, unfortunately. Sorry!
Liam: I wanted that baby to be punched so bad.
Matt: As you (ring firing), it (whoosh) out of the way and the fist goes by. Slamming into the wall. (crash)
Taliesin: One day, it's going to be epic.
Sam: It worked once.
Matt: It got you a kill. The marid.
Liam: That little baby just Zatoichi-ed out of the way.
Matt: Yeah, so you're just like, (ring firing). No effect. It dodges out of the way. And now you can see its weird, lifeless white eyes turn towards you once more.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: That end your turn?
Sam: Yep.
Matt: All righty. Let's see here. It's going to go ahead and use another ability now. As it sees that you're closed in, it glances over, and you watch as suddenly, a bunch of stonework just (rushing noise) up in the center of the area, as now--
Marisha: Oh, fuck. One of these guys. What? A wall?
Matt: A giant stone wall suddenly shoots up above to about 40 feet.
Sam: We got this, guys. Don't worry. Me and Grog got it. Me and buried-Grog and buried-Keyleth, we got this.
Marisha: Wait, you're buried, too?
Sam: No, you are and Grog is.
Marisha: I'm under the wall, right?
Matt: You're underneath right over here. You're on the outskirts of the wall.
Sam: It's just me and the baby right now?
Matt: Yeah, you and the baby, and an air elemental, and a giant sword that's swinging.
Marisha: Yeah, my air elemental is there.
Sam: Oh, great. I'm fine, then.
Matt: But you lose vision entirely, Pike. Just (rushing noise) wall's in front of you. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: So is the wall hitting the roof?
Matt: No, the wall would have to go way high. It's about 40 feet up.
Taliesin: I'm going to run up to the top of that wall.
Matt: Your movement will not get you to the top. Because you only move 30 feet.
Taliesin: How far will my movement get me?
Matt: It'll get you about there.
Ashley: Parkour!
Travis: Like some unmotivated Spider-Man.
Taliesin: In that case-- oh fuck, I've got nothing I can do.
Matt: I'll put you right there to remind us, but you're almost at the top of the wall at your full movement.
Taliesin: Well, then I will burn my action to dash up.
Matt: Okay. You get to the top of the wall, there, and you can now see it.
Taliesin: And I assume I can get part of the way down the wall as well with my action?
Matt: You can get partway down the wall, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, so I just want to start making my way, I'm going Spider-man.
Matt: So you get about, I'll say, there on the opposite side.
Taliesin: That was definitely irritating.
Matt: That's your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: That, and I'm going to cast Hex on that little baby. And he has disadvantage on, let's make it his wisdom checks.
Matt: Okay. All right. At the end of your turn, Percy. Let's see, it's going to go ahead and use--
Taliesin: That's a lot of actions, this creature.
Matt: It's legendary actions. It manipulates the area around it. Because you are currently standing on the side there. No, you know what, it's going to hold off. It's not going to do anything. Vax, you're up.
Taliesin: I haven't actually technically attacked it.
Liam: I know what I want to do. You tell me what I can do. First thing I want to do is cast Bless on-- I grab Vex, cast Bless on us and Pike, I have a range of 30 feet on it.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Is that bonus? No, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. I fly straight at Pike and I'm going to lift her up.
Matt: Okay, you immediately take eight points of fire damage by getting close to the flames to grab her. It's like (fire noises).
Liam: Sure. And then is it an action to grab and an action to lift and carry over?
Matt: I'd say it would be an action to grab her enough, and you're going to move at half speed with her.
Liam: Which is still a ton at this point.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: And that's all I need is the action to grab her and movement to go over?
Matt: Action, and your movement there was about there, I'd say you'll get your action and your movement will get you to up above the wall.
Liam: Okay. Action and movement will. All right, then I will leave her on top of the wall, and I will use my bonus action to fly within range of baby, and I should have one action left, yeah? Action, action, bonus action, hasted.
Matt: Right. Hold on, no. You used an action to pick up Pike. You brought her up there, you moved, you have another action and a bonus action. You have an action and a bonus action. But the extra action that you have is from your haste, which means it can be used for either a melee attack or ranged.
Liam: Great. So the bonus action I will use to dash towards baby. And my final, hasted attack action, I will stay 30 feet away from the baby, though, in the air, and I will throw Whisper with my last, hasted action.
Matt: Okay. There you go. Put you down there.
Liam: And that's a 25, which hits, yeah?
Matt: That hits. That just hits, yeah.
Liam: One, and can I dump Smite into this?
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah.
Liam: I would like to. There's nine plus psychic damage is 16 plus-- 20, 26, and here comes the sneak attack damage, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 37, 43, 47.
Matt: 47? Nice. As you swipe down to (whoosh) fling Whisper out, it slams right into the chest of the creature and it impales it off the back side and there's the burst of divine energy inside, but you see the divine energy matches its own, and what looks like a blow that would've killed the creature, it's like, (raspy inhale). Turns back towards you, and gives another scream as the dagger returns to you. End of your turn?
Liam: That's the end of my turn.
Matt: All right, at the end of your turn, it's going to use its last legendary action. It's going to use another cold snap. You feel the air around you, familiar, (whoosh) condense, and the ice cling to you. The air in your lungs freezes solid, it seems. Go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Going to use another Luck. 25.
Matt: 25 will succeed, all right. So you shrug off the stunned effect, but you do still suffer the halved damage. 13 points of cold damage. All righty. Pike, you're up. Top of your turn, you suffer no damage, because you got out of the fire. You're at the top of the wall now.
Ashley: All right. If I climb down there, it's an athletics thing?
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: Oh, okay. I'll climb down.
Matt: Roll an athletics check. It's 40 feet down. So that's going to be a long climb.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Oh no.
Travis: Oh, is it really? Is it fucking really?
Matt: It's a natural one?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Who put her on the top of a 40 foot wall?
Laura: Just picked her up and dropped her there.
Ashley: Wait!
Liam: She can see and cast spells!
Ashley: I have Feather Fall with my shield.
Matt: You do. So you use your reaction to cast Feather Fall on yourself as you stumble off the side, and as you plummet about 20 or so of the 40 feet (whoosh, soft impact) and you land unscathed on the ground.
Ashley: Okay. Is that just my action?
Matt: That's your reaction to do that. With the shield.
Ashley: Okay. How close am I to the baby? Can I get to the baby?
Matt: Not physically. It's over here and you're at the base of the wall.
Liam: It's like 50 feet.
Ashley: All right.
Matt: You can get within range to it.
Ashley: So you know what? I'm going to (sings) Guiding Bolt the baby!
Matt: Okay, what level?
Ashley: Let's do five. 5th-level.
Matt: Oh, shit, okay. Go ahead and roll for an attack on that. Wait, is Guiding Bolt an attack? No, is it a saving throw? I think it's a saving throw, isn't it? I always forget that. No, it's a ranged spell attack, so you have to roll to hit it. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.
Ashley: It's not enough I don't think. 19? I will use Guided Strike.
Matt: Because you can do that! Guided Strike, you get to add that to your own attack?
Ashley: Yep.
Travis: Channel Divinity.
Matt: (laughs) Still checking it. Guided Strike. Yeah, plus ten to the roll. That'll do it. 29, boom. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Ashley: How many sixes? Let's see.
Matt: Well it's four levels above that, so it's 8d6 radiant damage.
Ashley: I'll get five, six, seven, eight. Okay, so we've got six, 12. Help me out here, guys. 18. Oh, wow.
Laura: You rolled a lot of sixes!
Ashley: Whoa!
Travis: She rolled six sixes.
Matt: Six sixes?
Marisha: What do you mean?
Liam: She rolled a ton of sixes.
Ashley: 42.
Matt: 42 points?
Travis: I'm looking at them.
Laura: They're all sixes.
Ashley: We choose to kill this celestial baby not because it is easy, but because it is hard!
Matt: So as you land gently on the ground after plummeting head over heels. (thuds, fire blast) Holding your holy symbol before you, you watch as this beam of condensed divine energy rockets across, and this tiny, floating, withered planar baby (fire blast) gets blasted. You watch as the wings get pushed back. It's holding itself in place, but you see the dark shadow outline as the energy is blasting through it. As it hits, its wings recoil, and it's still floating there, but you can see this sparkly outline of divine energy, because the next attack on it has advantage.
Ashley: Do I still have a bonus action?
Matt: You do. Your sword's still up.
Ashley: I'll use the spiritual weapon.
Matt: Spiritual weapon, you can move 20 feet as a bonus action. It moves up and takes a swipe. Go ahead and roll an attack.
Ashley: Oh crap, my boots are stuck together. How is this happening? Okay. Yeah, the hook on the top there.
Laura: That's how she fell off the wall.
Ashley: Ooh. That's a 29.
Matt: 29 hits! Yeah, so go ahead and roll the damage for the spiritual weapon, which is 1d8 plus five, I think, for you. Whatever your wisdom modifier is.
Ashley: Sorry, guys. I don't know what I'm doing. Oh, that's not a lot. Seven.
Matt: Seven points of damage. It all helps. All righty. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I'm underground, right?
Matt: You're underground, you are restrained, you are blind. You cannot see anything.
Marisha: (growls) I'm going to go earth elemental.
Matt: Okay!
Taliesin: I'm amazed he didn't already have it out of the bag.
Matt: And with that ability, you get an earthglide, and this is a non-issue for you. All righty, Keyleth. So you are an earth elemental.
Travis: Damn!
Marisha: Do I have enough movement to earthglide to them?
Matt: What's your speed?
Marisha: I think 60, earthglide?
Matt: 60, earthglide? Yeah, totally. You're moving into melee with the baby?
Marisha: Okay, can I come up from underground, grab them, and then beat them into the ground?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and roll a slam attack.
Taliesin: Puny god!
Matt: Make two slam attacks, so roll twice. It's plus eight to attack each time.
Marisha: That's cocked. Natural 20 on that one, and a four on a second one, which is 12.
Matt: Yeah, that misses. MARISHA; Okay, but that one is a natural 20.
Matt: As you reach up out of the ground from underneath, (impact noise) your fingers clasp around the celestial baby and (whack) slam it into the ground as hard as you can. Go ahead and roll damage on that. 2d8 plus five, so roll the 2d8.
Marisha: And then you double the 2d8.
Matt: You double whatever you rol for the 2d8 and then add plus five. Crit that baby. It's our next t-shirt: Crit that baby!
Marisha: Six doubled, which is 12, plus five doubled, which is ten, so that's 22.
Matt: The bonus isn't doubled. Just the dice.
Marisha: I know. Just the dice is 22, plus five. So 27.
Matt: That's great. 27 points of damage. (wham) Slamming onto the ground. As your hand retracts up, you can see the wings are-- as it starts to fly up, it (gasps).
Marisha: And I just want to hold onto it and be like, yo! Yo, air elemental! And then let my air elemental come over and do its thing. Double slam attack.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Slam attack. No, I'm going to do a multi attack. Two slam attacks. So 2d8 plus eight, once again. That's an 18 and a 17. Plus eight.
Matt: 18 and 17 plus eight?
Marisha: Yeah, so 26 and 25.
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Which is 3d8 plus two. So the first one, oh! Six, seven, eight, plus seven, which is 15. For the first one, 15 plus two. 17. And then the second one is eight, plus two fives, which is 18 plus two, so 20.
Matt: Nice.
Taliesin: And he gets flung in a random direction?
Matt: No, this was just hitting it. (impacts) All righty. That's the end of your turn? All right. As it comes back to the entity's turn, it's looking really, really rough. And as part of that, it's going to reach into itself. Its hands push into its torso, and as it screams, (raspy scream) it gives out this horrible scream as it tears some of its chest open, and from the inside, where you imagine it would be a ribcage, it's this impossibly bright light that echoes out in a shockwave, affecting everybody except for Vex, actually. I need everybody else to make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: All of us?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh boy. That don't look good.
Taliesin: We don't have advantage on this, do we?
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a Resolve.
Marisha: Constitution  that's part of my physical stats as being an elemental, correct? It's con, strength, and dex. Never mind. Yeah.
Matt: So?
Sam: 22.
Matt: 22. That succeeds.
Taliesin: 17.
Marisha: 15.
Liam: 24.
Matt: That succeeds. Pike?
Ashley: 11.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 25.
Matt: Succeeds. Everyone who succeeds, you suffer 48 points of radiant damage.
Sam: Radiant damage?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: 48 on a success. Whoa.
Matt: If you failed, you took 96 points of radiant damage.
Taliesin: Wait, that's magical. I have advantage. The cloak wouldn't--
Matt: The cloak doesn't say a spell effect?
Taliesin: Against spells and other magical effects.
Matt: Technically, because it's not a leveled spell, it's just a radiant blast, it would not affect it.
Taliesin: It wouldn't have given me advantage on that save?
Matt: No, it wouldn't.
Ashley: 96, you said?
Matt: 96 points of radiant damage. So Keyleth, I need you-- your elemental has gone berserk.
Marisha: There's no way.
Matt: Aside of rolling a 20. Go for it. Just try.
Marisha: Unless I roll a nat 20? They just do their own thing if you fail.
Travis: What do you got to roll, a 20? Percy, bless that shit.
Matt: Even so, I'm letting you have this opportunity.
Marisha: I rolled a 19.
Matt: Nope. So as the Conjure Elemental spell fails, the control of your elemental shifts, and now it's aggressively turning its attention towards you and the rest of your party.
Marisha: Can I not fade it after this? Oh, I can drop concentration on it and then it will go away, right?
Matt: No. That's not how this works.
Travis: Did you just put--
Liam: A new enemy on the map.
Sam: A new opponent enters.
Marisha: To be fair, didn't it also get affected by the blast?
Matt: Yeah, actually. Roll a constitution saving throw for the air elemental. It's a plus two.
Marisha: I rolled a 13, plus two, so 15.
Matt: The air elemental is actually destroyed. To your advantage, strangely.
Marisha: It only has 90 hit points, so it's fine, guys! It's fine.
Matt: All right, so the entity looks like it's barely hanging on, and you see parts of its internal body falling out from where it tore its chest open. It's going to use a bonus action to Misty Step out of this vicinity over to here. It's going to use its movement to fly high up, almost trying to escape the cavern now. It's up in that region right there. We'll say, here. On top of this. Turn that away.
Laura: Oh, look how teeny! I can finally see it.
Ashley: Above a fountain.
Liam: It's a faerie dragon.
Laura: It's so teeny.
Matt: All righty. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I guess I'll fly up so I can see over the wall. I have no idea what's going on.
Matt: You fly up and you see everyone below is wrecked, the ground is charred with some sort of a radiant blast. You watched it flash over the wall itself, like a small, rapid recreation of the intro of Akira. (boom) This big, arcing ball of white energy.
Laura: Wow. Can I Hunter's Mark the baby?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: And then I'm going to try to shoot the baby with my Blazing Bowstring. That would be a 30. And I'm going to make it a bramble shot.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Ball of vines in the air.
Laura: DC of 17.
Matt: Strength?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: I actually rolled a natural 17.
Laura: Motherfucker. Okay, well.
Matt: But it still takes the damage.
Laura: Still 4d8 extra. Well. 17, plus five is 22, plus eight is 30, plus two is 32, plus 1d6 lightning damage... 35, plus 1d6 for Hunter's Mark is 40.
Matt: 40, nice! So as it hits, you watch as the brambles try and wrap around it, but it actually flies free.
Laura: Oh wait! Plus the blazing bowstring, another two fire damage.
Matt: 42 total. You can see more of it's just falling out of its small, decomposing torso, and it's trying to fly upward now, towards the light. It's on the edge.
Laura: I want to try to do the same thing again.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Laura: With a Blazing Bowstring again. 28.
Matt: 28 hits. Roll damage.
Laura: Okay, bramble shot again, because I get two, motherfucker! That's ten for my Blazing Bowstring. Oh, Jesus H. Macy. 19, plus five is 24, plus eight is 32, 36. Oh my god, 34. 38, plus ten is 48.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Frozen no more! Freeze me at your peril!
Laura: Be free, little angel baby. We shall feast tonight! That's so gross. And I just shoot the baby.
Matt: All right. As you pull back as it's fluttering up, you take aim and release, and as the arrow strikes it, you can see, the same way the dagger hit the baby, it hits it, and throws it, the sheer force of the arrow against the wall, and pins it there like it's stapled to the rock. As it reaches over to try and pull the arrow out, and it begins to, suddenly the arrow (whoosh) breaks into a bunch of bramble vines that begin to wrap around it, and you watch as the tiny baby arm and wing try and reach out (choking) as it constricts and twists and slowly constrains it until you see it (crack) pop and go limp on the inside of the vines. And as the vines unfurl, what was physically there is slowly dissipating into a glitter-like powder. The body dissipating and falling apart.
Laura: I mean, it was an evil baby, right?
Travis: Yeah, nobody likes glitter.
Marisha: Yeah, glitter gets everywhere.
Laura: Should we get out of here?
Travis: (muffled) I don't mean to be rude!
Marisha: I run over to Grog. I'm still an elemental, yeah? I am still an elemental. Where is he?
Matt: You don't know, actually.
Sam: I saw it. I'll point down.
Marisha: You point. I earthglide and I find him.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I can do double damage to structures. Can I beat him out?
Matt: I'd say you could probably, over time, yeah. You have enough constitution to be fine.
Marisha: I don't want to kill him by suffocating.
Matt: No, he's fine. He can hold his breath for six minutes. He's got a really high constitution, so you're fine. You slowly pummel the rock out from his way and pull Grog out from the interior of the stone floor.
Taliesin: Yeah, we should head out and bug bomb the place.
Travis: Don't we need proof?
Taliesin: Grab the body. Let's go.
Sam: There's no body!
Marisha: I go over to the glitter and I get some of my potion bottles from my alchemy to-- Oh, I'm actually good at this. I try and harvest some, sweep some glitter.
Matt: Okay. So you gather some glitter in.
Taliesin: Really quick, just look around, is there anything of value to grab before we run?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: I'll look, too.
Laura: While she's doing that, can I just look over the ground and see if there's any platinum deposits?
Sam: We could do a quick mining.
Matt: I mean, there are a number of visible edges of veins.
Liam: Is there 230,000 gold worth?
Sam: Probably. We could stay here for a couple months.
Matt: In this whole mine, there's a lot of platinum, but you have to mine it. And as you guys are having this moment, you begin to hear the loud sound of hundreds of large insect-like creatures climbing their way down the walls.
Laura: Oh god. Get to the middle and get in the air.
Marisha: Okay, so I get everybody in the middle. Is everyone ready?
Travis: I need help.
Taliesin: We pulled you out.
Marisha: What do you mean, you need help?
Travis: I'm on the other side of the 40-foot wall from the carpet.
Marisha: I go (boom) and I pull Grog through.
Laura: No, the carpet. We just got to get the carpet. I can go down and grab the carpet.
Marisha: Oh, the carpet. I take a few minutes as my earth elemental self to beast through...
Laura: We don't have a few minutes.
Marisha: I can do double damage to structures.
Laura: You don't have to do that. I can go get the carpet. I'm right there.
Marisha: Oh, okay. Go get the carpet.
Matt: Okay. So you rush over and grab the carpet. And you guys begin to make your way back up through.
Laura: Are we bamfing out or are we flying up?
Taliesin: I think we're flying up and if we see anything we'll just take shots at anything that's rolling around, if anything is visible. Let's just do damage on our way out.
Marisha: Oh, we're doing damage as we fly out.
Liam: Or we could Tree Stride out?
Taliesin: We can't Tree Stride. There's no trees.
Laura: Or we can Plane Shift.
Matt: There is a small tree growing out of the side of the wall from where you killed the creature, but it's not large enough for that spell.
Laura: But still really cool!
Matt: Yeah, it grows and twists out, like a bonsai curves upward.
Laura: I hope that it slowly becomes a forest underground.
Travis: They're going to chop it down as they mine the platinum.
Matt: All right, so you guys are coasting up through the shaft?
Marisha: Oh, are we just riding up?
Travis: Straight up.
Marisha: Broom and carpet? Broom and carpet.
Matt: Okay. You guys begin heading up through the center column of this opening. As you're moving up, are you staying in the darkness?
Laura: Can you Daylight or something, like up and out?
Marisha: I can. Do we need to?
Taliesin: You know, at this point, it might be.
Marisha: On the top of my spire I cast Daylight.
Matt: Okay. So (boom) this light now emerges from this area, and as you can see now through this cavern around you, there's about a dozen or so of these large ankheg creatures, about every 30 feet or so, 40 feet up. You're in the center of-- you look up and you can see easily the hundred that you saw earlier have all been drawn to the surface by the screams of this creature. And as you begin rocketing up with this Daylight spell, you watch as some of them start hanging upward in your direction. You start hearing this sound, (hiss).
Marisha: Are they attracted to the Daylight?
Matt: They're apparently attracted to your presence. It is a line shot. I'm going to go ahead and have, let's see here. Percy and Vex, I need you guys to both make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Oh shit. Oh god, we did not-- pretty sure you said that last time, before you turned into Chef Boyardee.
Matt: Sorry, sorry, not constitution. Dexterity, my apologies.
Laura: Dexterity saving throw? That is so much better.
Taliesin: Should I reroll? Yeah, I'll reroll.
Laura: Should you reroll?
Matt: Yeah, roll again; it's fine.
Laura: 27.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: Yeah, you both make it. So you both suffer eight points of acid damage.
Taliesin: I want to start taking shots as high up as I can see, I want to start taking shots at these things.
Laura: Yeah, I'll do the same thing.
Matt: There are over a hundred. And they take more than a few shots to go. We'll say you start picking them off, a few as you go, but you watch them fall past you. There's just such a mass number of them. As you guys get up another 40 or so feet, (spray sound) again. From three different ones. All right, I need Taryon, Percival, and Vex again to make dexterity saving throws.
Sam: Natural 20!
Matt: Nice!
Travis: Nice!
Taliesin: I'll live with that. 17.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Okay, six points of acid damage to the three of you.
Sam: Halved to three for me.
Matt: You make your way up even further. You're about halfway up this tunnel at this point and now you're getting to the heavy cluster of these creatures. At this point, a large cluster of them begin to spray all across. I need all of you guys to make two dexterity saving throws. Anybody get lower than a 13?
Taliesin: Nope.
Ashley: I did.
Travis: I did.
Matt: For one?
Travis: For the second one.
Marisha: Lower than a 13?
Matt: Yeah. That would be all of you except for Pike and Grog take a total of 14 points of acid damage. Both of you guys, for the purposes of this, take 21 points of acid damage.
Sam: You okay there, Pikey-pants?
Ashley: Yeah, I'm fine!
Travis: I'm okay.
Matt: As you're shooting and you hear the gunfire (gunshots) going off, you fire the arrows. More and more of these ankhegs are falling and crumbling off. You hear the (screeching) as they streak past you, plummeting into the darkness below. Even more so, throwing streams out. However, their numbers are starting to thin because you've gone past the thick part of it. Vax, Pike, and Grog. The three of you guys roll dexterity saving throws, please.
Travis: 12.
Liam: 19.
Ashley: 18.
Travis: 12.
Matt: All right. Six points of acid damage, six points of acid damage, 12 points of acid damage.
Laura: How much further do we have to go up?!
Matt: You guys, with the brooms and the carpet, it's not super fast. Putting up there again. You get about three-quarters of the way up.
Sam: What is Pike riding on?
Matt: She's on the carpet.
Ashley: I'm on the carpet. I'm okay.
Laura: You should heal yourself!
Ashley: I know.
Marisha: Can I do a Wind Wall to protect us from around us?
Matt: Wind Wall is stationary. It might help with one round of the spray.
Marisha: Are we doing one more round?
Matt: You'll find out. You don't know.
Marisha: If we are, I will prep my Wind Wall spell to encompass us for one more round.
Matt: Okay. As you guys are heading upward, now you're about three-quarters of the way out. The numbers are thinning a little bit. They start spraying once more. You go ahead and create a Wind Wall that you've been preparing. As you watch, these jets of extremely acidic burning liquid shoot toward you, suddenly a column of wind gets conjured upward from the darkness and deflects the spray into a mist that is thrown back against the wall harmlessly. You're almost to the exit, and you see a handful more towards the very top of this cavern. Keyleth, Percy, and Pike. Make a dexterity saving throw, if you can.
Sam: Pikey.
Marisha: I'm good. 21.
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a reroll. It's the end of my resolves!
Ashley: Oh! Natural 20.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Okay, so eight points of acid damage. 16. Keyleth?
Marisha: 21.
Matt: All right. That's eight points of acid damage. You took the--
Ashley: Eight.
Matt: The eight, yeah. As you guys just crest out of the top of the dark column below, you can watch as the creatures are starting to skitter out from the edges, but you are far above and a few of them are spraying, but you're above the range and it's coasting over and disappearing below. You've now emerged into the night sky, the moonlight above you. You're all fairly beaten.
Taliesin: Is there anything we can throw down there to really piss them off?
Sam: I'll drop a bead of Firewall.
Marisha: Yeah, and I can drop a Fireball on there.
Sam: I'm sorry, a Wall of Fire.
Matt: You're going to throw a Wall of Fire on the edge of it?
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, and I'll throw a Fireball. Burn the place down. Extermination.
Taliesin: Bug bomb.
Travis: I spit in the hole.
Ashley: I was going to see if I could put a Blade Barrier on top of the hole, so once the fire's in there, they can't get out.
Matt: What's the radius on Blade Barrier?
Ashley: 90 feet.
Matt: Okay, we'll say as you come out the top, you throw down the Blade Barrier-- what's the radius of it, though?
Ashley: I don't think it says.
Matt: I'll pull it up real fast.
Ashley: Oh, it does say.
Laura: 60 feet in diameter. No! You can make a straight wall of 100 feet or 60 feet in diameter.
Ashley: Yeah, ringed wall up to 60 feet.
Matt: Okay, so you can make a wall around the one side of it. Not the whole thing.
Sam: Wall of Fire around the other?
Matt: You don't get to get the whole radius, but between the Wall of Fire and the bladed wall, you blast the opening there. You coast away, watching and hearing as dozens of ankhegs that are climbing up to the top begin to (screeching). Eventually, they all begin to burrow back into the rock and stone and vanish. The ones on the surface begin to burrow below. And a calm stillness comes over the exterior of the mines. As you all coast up, hundreds of feet in the air over the forest, licking your wounds. So you removed the glitter and you removed--
Laura: The little coffin.
Matt: The little stone placard. You had to wedge it out, but you got it up there.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: And that's where we'll call it for the night.
Travis: Nice!
Marisha: That was awesome!
Taliesin: I'm at 57 hit points. Yay.
Travis: Add 100 to that and that's somewhere Grog.
Taliesin: Where were you at? I feared for you, man.
Ashley: 11.
Laura: Oh my god!
Travis: That cherub was a bitch.
Matt: Aw man. That was also created by the chat.
Travis: Was it?!
Laura: The baby was created by the chat?!
Travis: Why you do this to us, chat?
Taliesin: Why you make us kill a baby? That was great.
Laura: That was a really cool villain.
Matt: That was a tiny celestial.
Liam: Like beating up a Kewpie doll.
Matt: Was the prospect of doing something that attacks via the terrain instead of--
Ashley: Was he an evil baby?
Laura: Yeah, was it evil? Or could we have saved it?
Matt: The actual title for it is Symphior the Withered Planetar. It was essentially a celestial seed that was placed to eventually emerge as a guardian in a future time, almost a Ragnarok-type circumstance. But the land around it became corrupted as it gestated or was held in stasis, and then was awoken prematurely. And as such, became this horrible monstrous version of what it was supposed to be. It was neutral, but it was dangerous. It seemed pretty far gone. Thank you guys so much. We'll be back next week with the battle royale. That'll be fun.
Travis: Everybody kill Keyleth.
Laura: Yeah. Go for Keyleth to begin with. Try to kill her.
Marisha: I am going to be looking at all of my spells.
Taliesin: These two have to be the first to go down.
Marisha: What? Why?
Taliesin: Because loot drop.
Travis: Yeah, we've got to get Hunger Games with this shit. Defend the cornucopia of loot!
Marisha: I'm going for the machete!
Sam: But Vex, you're my best friend!
Laura: No, you're my best friend. I won't kill you.
Sam: Okay! Like, within five minutes.
Liam: This one shoved my face into lava at the end of the last battle royale.
Marisha: I love you! (sizzling)
Matt: It was pretty good.
Marisha: Then Pike did it to me immediately the next round. I love you! (sizzling)
Matt: Yeah, it was pretty slick. Exactly.
Marisha: Yes, it was.
Laura: Tight.
Matt: Awesome. Thank you so much for watching. We'll be back next week, Thursday, with our battle royale. Hope you have a wonderful night and weekend. And is it Thursday yet? Good night! [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Glad you could join us for what is essentially the final and epilogue episode of our five-year campaign. We're excited you guys could come join us.
Sam: Not the final episode of the show!
Matt: We will return. We're looking probably at the start of the new year with a new campaign, new characters.
Laura: But we'll have one-shots and stuff in between.
Matt: Yeah, we'll have fun stuff to break it up and give us some time to let off some steam in the meantime. But before we get into tonight's game, let's get through some quick announcements. First off, we wanted to give a shout out. If you guys haven't seen it yet, Shadow of War just came out, the sequel to Shadow of Mordor. A bunch of us have worked on it and if you haven't seen, we had the opportunity to do a cool thing with WB Games and the folks at Monolith. We did a Shadow of War one-shot that was uploaded as a two-parter.
Laura: It was so much fun!
Liam: You were so cute, all of you. It was the cutest orc adventure that ever happened.
Sam: You watched it?
Liam: Both episodes.
Laura: Thanks bro!
Matt: It was a lot of fun. We had Sam, Laura, Travis, and the illustrious Darin De Paul as our four orcs and/or olog-hai, charging their way through Mordor in hopes of victory spoils and all that.
Laura: It's real fun to be stupid.
Travis: I don't know what you're talking about.
Matt: So I recommend checking it out if you haven't yet. Merch update, Laura?
Liam: Wait! Something I can say now. I didn't have the green light, but I am in that game. I had to fib and say that I wasn't in that game, but I'm in that game! I am back as Gollum! And I run around and I do this, and I do this, and I do this, and I do this. (Gollum voice) Tasty fish!
Matt: If you guys haven't seen Liam's Gollum in the games, it's the most ridiculous--
Travis: Also to point out, you did the full mo-cap for it. Not just the VO.
Liam: Broke my back, scuttled around like I was a young buck, which I'm not. It was great!
Laura: I wish I still had the video of you that you sent me after you first started, yeah. When he first started playing Gollum, he sent me this video of him running around his living room, jumping up on his couch, then running over and jumping up your entertainment system or something.
Liam: I put my laptop on the coffee table, I hit click, and I started going--
Laura: It was so amazing.
Liam: Because I'm a nerd.
Matt: Awesome. Well, thank you for the follow-up on that, Liam. Laura?
Laura: Oh, well, technically, I have to shove this one to Liam and Taliesin, as well.
Taliesin: I feel like we've been doing the thing for a while now.
Liam: Yeah, like when parents have a baby, you don't see them for a while. They're with that baby every hour, every minute. (yelling)
Liam: Oh my gosh, it's the new art book! Oh my god, it's gorgeous! I took it out of the Ark of the Covenant, and here it is!
Laura: Okay, I should qualify this, because it's not in the store yet, you guys, so don't go to the store and freak out. It just came into the office.
Liam: Yeah, this is just our viewing copy. There will be more details--
Sam: What does it say on the title there?
Liam: It says The Chronicles of Exandria  The Tale of Vox Machina. One.
Sam: Volume One? Implying that there's going to be more?
Taliesin: Implying that we'd like to.
Liam: We'd like there to be. And you guys can tune in next week to Talks Machina, where we will have more info, more details.
Laura: We'll say when they're going to go in the store.
Matt: Can you give a teaser flip of any pages?
Liam: I have been told that I cannot give a teaser flip. But wait, guys. There's more! Taliesin, if you would?
Taliesin: Well, we did two editions because we wanted to do something a little ridiculous. And so--
Sam: What is this? A special edition?
Taliesin: This is a special edition. It's a little more fancy. It's got the ribbon and leather and gold foil. It's got an evil tome vibe, and it's got lots of little wonderful details.
Liam: We have held that book and looked through it. I cried 97 times in one minute. It is so beautiful.
Marisha: It really looks like crying for 60 seconds.
Laura: Tune in to Talks Machina on Tuesday. We'll give you more details about how you can purchase them. And you can always check out geekandsundry.com/artbook for more updates. They're coming soon. They should be in the warehouse very soon, so that's happy for the holidays.
Liam: Joe Madureira art!
Laura: I'm excited!
Taliesin: Yeah, there's lots to talk about in these books. I'm very excited!
Travis: And to cure any freakout, Ashley is going to join us. She's finishing up.
Matt: Finishing up shooting on Blindspot. So she'll pop in when she can.
Laura: This is her day job!
Taliesin: We keep trying to tell her that, don't we?
Liam: Wait. There's one last thing.
Sam: Two more editions of the art book!
Liam: I got one last thing, for funsies. It's a really late birthday present. It's kind of for funsies, but Travis, I have something for you that I've been wanting to give you for a while.
Sam: Is that an experience?
Travis: Can I open it?
Liam: Yeah, go for it.
Travis: What the fuck is this? (gasps)
Sam: Is it the Belt of Dwarvenkind?! (yelling)
Laura: Look at how big the face is!
Travis: Oh my god! Hug me through my wife! That's so great! I can't get hit in the dick with this on! This is amazing! It really covers the whole kit and kaboodle!
Liam: And your beard will double in length the moment you put it on. I had to repay you for the raven mask you gave me, once upon a time.
Laura: Oh yeah, our drunken ren fair purchases. I was like, "that's a cool mask! Where'd you get it?" And you said, "you got that for me."
Liam: Your husband just bought this for me! Thanks, Laura!
Matt: There you go. Also immune to poison. Good job. Perfect! So other updates. We are officially announcing the second edition of Vox Machina: Origins, the Critical Role comic. It's going to be available October 18th, so look for that on all your great comic book-- Comixology, the Dark Horse app, and all the other places that I can't think of right now. But yeah, so super exciting. This one starts bringing in some of the other members of Vox Machina who didn't show up in the first issue. So take a look at it, hope you guys enjoy. Let's see. Other quick announcements. Wednesday Club, Taliesin, you have coming up?
Taliesin: Yeah, it's October, so we're doing Halloween. We're doing Hellboy, which I don't really know much about. I couldn't think of anybody who knew a lot about Hellboy. Do you know a lot about Hellboy?
Liam: I know a lot about Hellboy.
Taliesin: Do you want to come on Wednesday Club?
Liam: Yes, please! Oh! I bought a Hellboy comic today! Another black compendium book to go with my other big black blades on my shelf.
Matt: Liam likes things that are big and black.
Laura: I'm glad your mind went there, too.
Taliesin: It's going to be Wednesday Club on Hellboy.
Matt: Then you have something on Friday, as well?
Taliesin: I do! I've decided it would be really funny to be here really late three days in a row for the rest of my life, and so I'm-- I don't want to quite say "taking over." Is "taking over" the word?
Marisha: That's fair.
Taliesin: I'm taking over Gather Your Party on Friday nights now, and we're giving it a bit of a revamp. It's going to be a bit of a different vibe. It's going to be a little shorter. It's going to be fun. Our very first episode is going to be called Gather Your Goth, and we're going to be giving some of our friends goth makeovers and having a goth dance contest.
Laura: Can I get made over? When are you doing it?
Taliesin: Tomorrow night.
Laura: Shit, I'm not going to be here! Fuck, I really want to be made over!
Taliesin: Well I'll tell you what. You let me know, and you can come over and have a goth makeover.
Matt: Next time you do it, you do whatever it's called, and then in parentheses Laura Your Goth, or Goth Your Laura.
Taliesin: Gather Your Laura. You would goth out very well. I think I would be excited by that.
Matt: All right. To finish this up, let's see. I forgot to mention it last week, but those of you guys who have been playing the Telltale Batman game, the new Pact episode came out recently with Harley Quinn and Bane, and I play Mr. Freeze! It's been a lot of fun, and I've been continuously recording on it. Hope you guys enjoy more fun to come with that delightful character.
Liam: You do have a cold heart.
Matt: It's true. Then you guys had a Sagas of Sundry announcement?
Marisha: Oh yeah! Sagas of Sundry announcement! Cast list went out! Who's in it? We are!
Liam: I didn't see you there at all!
Marisha: Look again! Abigail Persimmon.
Taliesin: The magic of the goth makeover strikes again! (cackles)
Marisha: I'm not coming tomorrow because I've already had mine.
Taliesin: No, I bought this shirt when we went shopping.
Marisha: That's right! You did! We went on a shopping trip, and we had so much fun.
Liam: It was fucking wild.
Marisha: Anyone who hasn't seen any of the first season--
Matt: Thanks for keeping tally.
Travis: He picked his cup up without drinking it again! Picks it up. (thunk)
Liam: Like an animatronic sailor!
Matt: Like a raccoon that can't find a river, I go through the motions of washing my food. All right. Couple of other things. It is still Sub-tober, because why not? That means if you haven't had the opportunity to subscribe to any of the Twitch streams that you're a fan of, you can do so half off until the 18th. So you can do that up until the 18th and then get the comic the same day, I guess. And since this is the final episode of the campaign, I wanted to give a shout out to all our fantastic crew. Wonderful people who have worked their ass off to stay here late every Thursday. We have Maxwell James, Dani Carr, Jason Corey, Ryan Green, Selina Ruth, Chris Wilmont, Zach Wilson, Sax Carr, Mark Donica, Anthony Videsco, Courtney Kraft, Ian Kagihara, Chris Lockey, Holly Pearson, Ryan Porter, Denise, J. Andrew Bernard, Ed Lopez, Rachel Romero, all of our fantastic mods who have done an incredible job maintaining the chaos that is Twitch, you guys are fantastic. We really appreciate all the hard work you guys put into it, and many, many more. The entire community, we can't even begin to express--
Laura: Did you say Fernando?
Matt: Yes, I did. Wait, Fernando. Someone didn't put Fernando on the list!
Sam: And many more whose names were omitted.
Matt: Correct, thank you guys so much for all your hard work!
Liam: Wait, let's come up with some more announcements so we never have to start.
Matt: Nope, I think we've stretched the audience's patience enough. Let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Liam: Autoerotic a-pixie-ation.
Matt: You were real late on the draw, but this is the night to do it. I guess.
Liam: Right on time.
Matt: It was perfect. Precisely when you mean to. All right. Last we left off, Vox Machina, through their trials and tribulations, had eventually come to realize the machinations of Vecna, who ascended into godhood, transported his city from the Shadowfell of Thar Amphala to the top, right above a long-dead earth primordial titan, rising it and making its way toward Vasselheim, the Dawn City, the beginning of creation. You battled your way through its innards, up within the arcane dome that protected it, managed to defeat one half of the long-frustrating Briarwood coupling, fought your way to the top of the tower Entropis, did battle with Vecna, the Ascended. Through careful planning and sacrifices, you managed to apply the trammels, complete the sealing ritual, and send Vecna screaming across the Divine Gate, to be sealed to wherever his divine demi-plane resides on the other side. As you all fell down upon the ruined, floating platforms of the tower Entropis, you glanced over as your recent ally, Arkhan the Cruel, proceeded to sever his own hand, attach the Hand of Vecna, and catching you off guard, transport himself beyond your current reach. This beat of intensity releasing slowly, the adrenaline still wearing its way through your veins, you sit in silence, looking about, amazed that you all still stand after such a confrontation. It's at that moment you hear this distant explosion. Glancing off the side of the platform you're on, you can still see, while the large titan, one of four arms raised, attempting to come and destroy all of you with one large blow, frozen in place, there still remains the dregs of Vecna's army down below throughout the city of Vasselheim, where battles are still raging in the streets. You can still see wyvern-riders and eagle-riders in the sky, though it appears that the gloomstalkers that once paraded across the skies over the city have been destroyed or scattered at the loss of the ascended god that summoned them. You also still are aware of the body of your sister, residing on the platforms below. It's at this point that you notice that the green tendrils of energy that hold the Tower of Entropis together begin to flicker and subside. The platforms that were slowly drifting, listing, suddenly begin to shift.
Laura: No! I take off on my broom, and I go down to try to get her.
Matt: Okay. You guys dart over the side. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Travis: I had the immovable rod pulled out, and I click it where I am.
Matt: All right. You hold in place. You feel the platform give beneath you. Your toes are now dangling in the middle of the air as you watch the cracked-open right side of Entropis' peak begin to topple and fall beneath you. What are you guys doing?
Marisha: I'm still a planetar. Do you still have Bigby's Hand up?
Sam: For maybe 30 seconds more.
Taliesin: Where's the carpet?
Travis: It's in my bag.
Marisha: I do a potato sack hold on Scanlan. Make sure he's all right.
Matt: You grab him. Pike still has some time. She still has her wings.
Travis: I can throw it to you.
Taliesin: That would be nice. Yes, please.
Travis: Can I pull the carpet out of the bag of holding? Do you want to free fall and go after it?
Matt: By the way, the platform is now giving underneath you.
Sam: Why don't you fly it over?
Travis: I don't think I can be on it with him. Right? I'm still enlarged.
Marisha: Here, can one of us fly over and get it?
Laura: Technically, he was on the broom with me, so I could've dropped him off with one of you before I flew down to Velora.
Matt: As you're having this conversation about the carpet, you're dragged down over the side as the broom rockets off, Vex's mind currently focused more on other things. So the last thing you hear from Percival is, "Could you throw--" as he darts off to the side. The platform is beginning to give as the flickering green energy begins to fade. You guys both dart beneath where you can see upon the rubble, where the top staircase had broken apart from the original sundering of the top of the tower. There you see, still lying there, lifeless, the body of Velora. You rush in there just as the platform's collapsing. I need you both to make acrobatics checks on this to see how quickly you can maneuver in and out.
Laura: Okay, it's 30.
Liam: 31.
Matt: Both of you guys rush inward. As some of the various chunks are beginning to fall and separate from underneath the platforms, you begin to dart through, dodge, and you grab and lift her body. Both of you cradling her, and at a moment's notice, deciding which one of you's going to take her.
Liam: I've got her.
Matt: All right. Vax, you go ahead and dart off. You careen back out of the way as the central, large platform crashes down with a heavy impact. You can see it crumble, then break, and three separate pieces beginning to tumble. The tower then gives in from underneath and begins to collapse downward, almost like a controlled demolition. As it begins to fall and topple down below, you all gather your thoughts and consider other allies that were recently--
Travis: Falling?
Matt: A short time ago, yes.
Laura: Zahra and Kash?
Marisha: With Scanlan in hand, start diving down to go see if I can find them or have any sight of them at all.
Matt: What's the flying speed of your planetar?
Marisha: 150 feet.
Matt: Okay. As you, holding Scanlan under your arm, coast down at a speed to the point where now you're actually racing the crumbling of the tower. You're watching the actual cracks as they emerge, as the energy's dissipating, beginning to subside, as your speed overtakes the rate in which it's collapsing.
Marisha: Like Superman and Lois Lane.
Matt: (laughter). The G's are intense, Scanlan. Your eyes are watering, blown back on your face. The Ioun symbol on your forehead is flaring like a spotlight ahead of you. As you rocket down, you glance, you can see there across the rocks at the bottom, two wyverns that are scattered across the rubble, and you see, lying there, the bodies of Kashaw and Zahra.
Sam: They're dead. Turn around. Let's go back. They're dead.
Marisha: Shut up, Scanlan! Are they dead?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: How high am I hanging off of this thing?
Matt: Make--
Travis: A perception check? I am a million-- eight.
Matt: You're high up there. That's a long way up.
Marisha: 18.
Laura: You can use the carpet because Percy's on the broom with me.
Matt: Their bodies are brutalized from the impact. They hit.
Marisha: They're splatted.
Matt: Well, they're not splatted.
Laura: They're not you on the cliff.
Marisha: Sure. They didn't goldfish it.
Travis: But a good Revivify might help.
Sam: They're unconscious?
Matt: You're just now approaching. As you get there, you can hear the rumbling of the tower getting louder. You've barely beaten it. What are you doing?
Marisha: I've got to move them, right? Is that what you're saying? Scanlan? You're fine, right? Handle yourself?
Matt: Scanlan, she sets you on the ground as you look over and see the tower (crashing).
Marisha: Do you want to hold onto my back?
Sam: I have no spells left, so yes. (laughter)
Sam: I will climb on.
Taliesin: I imagine Scanlan dropping that last potion as it's coming down.
Matt: Okay. As you dive on, you grab both of their limp bodies and pull them under your arms and dart. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, please.
Laura: Oh my god, if we thought we made it out of this--
Marisha: Okay, 18. No, wait! Yeah, 18.
Matt: 18. You manage to scoot by as one of the large chunks of the base falls over to one side, and as you dart out, wings before you, Scanlan clutched on your back, both their bodies beneath, you can feel the gust of wind from behind as the collapsing wall is pushing all the air in your direction. As you focus down, your wings out, you manage to careen underneath as the shadow that was beginning to fall over you pulls behind, and behind you hear the (boom), the dust pick up, and you guys all look down and watch as the tower finally falls to its final piece of rubble there on the ground. At which point you glance down, and you can see both of them, their eyes roll open, lolling in their face, both Zahra and Kashaw, seemingly conscious. If you guys want to step in? (cheering)
Marisha: I'm going to immediately burn two of my healing touches, and you get 6d8 plus three hit points back.
Matt: Kashaw and Zahra, you've been lying there on the ground for a moment going, "Ow," and as your vision focuses, you watch as the tower begins to collapse downward in your direction. The shadow seems to close over you.
Will: Well, that's not good.
Marisha: 29 hit points to both of you immediately.
Matt: And with a flash, something white-feathered and blue shoots past you, grabs you, and you are thrust into the air, carried by the angelic form of Keyleth.
Mary: Kiki? How are you, darling?
Marisha: Did you recognize me because of the antlers? That's why I keep them. They're very identifying.
Mary: I think I dreamed of you.
Marisha: No, that was real and incredible, and you all showed up.
Sam: Why did you come?
Will: We had to come. She made us. (laughter)
Mary: I had a vision.
Will: It's good to see you. Thank you for that.
Sam: You had a vision?
Mary: I did. I had a vision of white wings, and blue--
Will: Are you okay?
Mary: I think we're all right.
Will: Both of you?
Mary: Yeah.
Will: Don't piss off a pregnant tiefling.
Marisha: Yeah-- wait, what?
Will: Thank gods for that.
Sam: Haven't you heard of pulling out? (laughter)
Sam: I do it all the time!
Will: I tried. Didn't work.
Mary: I wouldn't let him.
Will: The tail held me in place.
Mary: You always said you liked that.
Will: Can you put us down somewhere, maybe?
Mary: That would be lovely, thank you.
Marisha: I drop Kash, but very lightly set down Zahra.
Matt: You tumble.
Marisha: Congratulations!
Mary: Did we win?
Matt: No, you're healed up; you're fine. The Death Ward brought you guys to one hit point, and then she healed you before she dropped you, so you're fine.
Will: No, I deserved that. Thank you. So did we win? What happened?
Sam: We're sitting on the titan now?
Matt: You're down in the street level of Thar Amphala.
Sam: But still on the Titan?
Matt: Still on the top of the Titan.
Sam: Is he falling?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Two.
Matt: You have no idea.
Sam: Pregnant?! What? I thought you were gay!
Will: We've talked about this. It's all right.
Travis: Can I take out the carpet and start making my enlarged form way down to them? By myself?
Laura: Well, Pike's with you.
Travis: Oh. Is she?
Laura: Yeah, Pike's still with you up there.
Travis: She's got wings.
Matt: With a strength of 19, and your enlarged size--
Travis: Can I dispel the enlarged?
Matt: No.
Travis: Oh, it's in for ten minutes. I'm just me. (laughter)
Matt: You get the sense, at this size, that carpet cannot carry you.
Travis: I'm just hanging out. I grab the earring and I say: Will someone please do me a favor? Will you look for Arkhan's hand? Find me that hand.
Sam: Is it falling?
Matt: It was on one of the platforms.
Marisha: Wait, you want to find his hand on the giant tower full of rubble?
Will: Whose hand?
Travis: Arkhan's.
Liam: Vex or I can find it.
Laura: In a moment.
Matt: At this point, you have both come down now to the base of the tower. At that speed, it took you a while to catch up to the rest of everybody else.
Marisha: I look up and say  Grog, do you need a hand? Are you all right? Damn it, the pun wasn't intended, Scanlan! (laughter)
Travis: I literally just said that.
Marisha: Do you need assistance getting down from hanging from a bar? In the middle of the air, to be very literal.
Travis: Yeah, it would be nice.
Marisha: I fly up.
Matt: So your angelic wing maneuver.
Mary: I can cast Fly on him.
Sam: Yeah, do that! Zahra has Fly, she can cast Fly on him!
Mary: I cast Fly on Grog.
Matt: Okay. You'll have to get up a little closer to do it, because you're out of range.
Mary: Can I use my Cloak of the Bat to fly up and then cast?
Matt: Yeah.
Mary: I fly up and I cast. Hello, darling!
Matt: You watch as Zahra, suddenly her cloak extends into two large, leathery bat wings and she flies her way up pretty close to where you are. For a second there, you glance down. Roll a perception check.
Travis: Ten.
Matt: You see a gloomstalker coming right at you.
Travis: (screams)
Matt: As you hold the sword out in front, you notice in a second, it's Zahra.
Travis: Oh. Not a gloomstalker.
Matt: But the sword, at this point, as you hold it out in front of you and push back, it goes, "One part is done. Well played. But he still survives. We'll take him. And we'll take that dragon. The hand must be destroyed. It's still out there. Together--"
Travis: Okay, yeah, I sheathe him. (laughter)
Travis: I need some Visine bad.
Mary: Grog! Hello, darling.
Travis: Hey, Zahra.
Mary: Did you ever use that moonhammer I gave you?
Travis: All the time. Covered in blood.
Mary: Right. In the moonlight, right?
Travis: Yep. Need to get it cleaned.
Mary: Good. Well, I look forward to hearing your tales. Do you need some help, my darling?
Travis: I do, unless you just want to hang out with me up here for a bit.
Mary: Well, I could. How is your arm? You know what, no, let's just do it. I cast Fly. Let go.
Matt: And you can fly. You're gliding in the air. (laughter)
Matt: He starts slowly--
Taliesin: Don't leave the rod!
Laura: Don't leave the rod!
Marisha: Don't leave the rod!
Travis: How do I do this?
Mary: It's all right. Just focus. Focus. You'll be fine, Grog. Just focus. Yes, think of yourself as a cow. As a flying cow. You remember?
Travis: Moo.
Laura: Grab the rod.
Travis: Oh, right. (click) Put it back in the bag of holding. This is great! Oh my god, I would do this every day.
Mary: Well, you could do it for at least an hour, so that's good.
Travis: Can I drunkenly fly down to everybody else?
Matt: And you do, it's a slow spiral, and you begin to gimbal backward, and she has to right you a couple times.
Travis: Can I fly right as I get closer, just for dramatic effect?
Mary: Focus on me. No squirrel. There's no squirrels. Focus your mind. No. It's all right, just come down. (singing)
Travis: I come down!
Mary: All right, you could do that, too. Look out below!
Travis: Three-point landing. Super hard.
Matt: Make an acrobatics check.
Travis: Super hard.
Will: Superhero landing.
Travis: (high voice) Not great.
Taliesin: Yay!
Laura: Not bad.
Travis: Oh, not bad, yeah. Yeah. 14.
Matt: 14. Okay. You were rage-hanging? You take 24 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to 12.
Laura: And Grog is dead.
Matt: And three-point landing. You watch as a crater is left beneath where his impact is. The smoke slowly subsides, and Grog's there, fist in the ground, Thor: Ragnarok style.
Laura: And we're all on the ground now?
Matt: You are all now on the ground floor of Thar Amphala. As you glance around--
Liam: I'm flexing the wings out and around, and I'm making a feather bed with the ends of the wings on the ground and laying Velora down on it.
Laura: Kash, tell me you have Revivify. Tell me you can bring her back.
Will: I believe I do.
Liam: I start combing her hair with my fingers, out of her eyes.
Will: Let me check. I do. Who am I casting it on?
Laura: Our sister.
Will: Oh. Oh, that doesn't look good. Yeah, okay. Let's see what we can do. I'm sorry, I'm still a little sore.
Laura: No. It's terrible. Please help her.
Will: It was a terrible fall. Give me one second.
Mary: I'm so sorry.
Will: Oh. Her? This one? Yeah, all right. Let's do that. I'm going to cast Revivify.
Matt: Okay. Unfortunately, she's been dead longer than a minute, so the spell does not take effect. You don't know how long it's been, or if perhaps your final moments of fucking with her was just enough to push it over the edge-- (laughter)
Will: It keeps happening! Sorry.
Sam: 61 seconds.
Will: I can speak to dead, if you'd like to talk with her.
Laura: No! I don't want to fucking talk to her, I want to have her back! (laughter)
Will: It's time for one message. Does she owe you money? I can have her find out where it is.
Liam: Do you have anything a little more potent right now?
Marisha: I can raise dead.
Will: Well, there we go. See?
Laura: Is she going to come back as a zombie?
Marisha: No.
Laura: She'll be a normal--
Taliesin: Just raised.
Marisha: I might need some help. Where's Pike?
Will: I can raise the dead, too, if you need help.
Matt: Pike has been slowly flying down.
Marisha: She doesn't come back as a zombie, right? It's raising dead.
Matt: Is it the actual Raise Dead spell?
Will: Mine is.
Marisha: It says three times a day.
Matt: Raise Dead. You can bring someone back to life, yeah. It takes an hour to cast.
Marisha: Yep.
Travis: Do they murder someone when you do that, like a horror movie?
Marisha: If I did it with Kash, would that--
Will: I'm with Zahra now, so let's try to keep that in mind.
Taliesin: Wow, two for two tonight.
Marisha: I don't know how to respond to that.
Liam: Your sense of humor is your best quality.
Will: Isn't it?
Liam: Best.
Will: We'll get her. She'll be fine!
Matt: As you guys take a moment and realize the time, the involvement that would be here to do the spell, you glance about in the streets of Thar Amphala, and what straggling undead and/or cultists seem to have been either trying to scramble back up to the city or hadn't made their way down through or were here as sentinels are frantically trying to escape and being cut down and grabbed by the various eagle riders and the rest of the army that's currently now beginning to swarm in, thanks to the complete falling of the barrier with the sealing of Vecna. You do feel at this moment that you do have some time in Thar Amphala without any immediate danger.
Will: But if it gets to that, I can stay and raise her, and you guys can go and take care of the city.
Laura: Thank you.
Marisha: I don't even know if I have a full hour left on my form. That's the only problem. That's why I would need help, but--
Will: She needs to rest, anyway.
Mary: I can stay. I'll stay with him.
Laura: Thank you.
Mary: We'll focus on her.
Sam: We'll all stay, until we don't have to.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I help Kash as much as I can.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I sit down and hold her hand.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Start cleaning her cheeks as well as we can.
Marisha: And I don't take my eyes off of Vax the whole time.
Sam: Oh, yeah. Shit.
Will: I'm holding my medal. Starting the spell.
Matt: As you guys form a perimeter here at the base of Entropis, the sky now open, the clouds dispelled and scattered, and probably for the first time in weeks, especially from your guys' perspective, Vasselheim sees a sky of blue. The sunlight rains down from above, and the warmth that comes through is very comforting as you begin to clear the space and scrawl out the sigils and glyphs necessary for this Raise Dead ritual. As you're going through the process and you quietly begin to focus, you can see some of the eagle riders and straggling wyvern riders take notice and begin to come close, and then stop and keep a distance, and recognizing the significance of this moment, respectfully stay away.
Will: As he's casting the glyphs, he goes over, he's about to write the last one, and he walks over to Vex, and he takes one tear, and he goes back over and uses it to do the last glyph.
Matt: As he draws the last glyph with the tear, that one seems to have an additional flair, a connection, a sparkle of bloodline connectivity between you and the deceased. As you complete the spell, I need you to go ahead and bring to this ritual what you'd like.
Sam: Oh god.
Laura: Jesus, really? Oh, god. I take one of my arrows that has the owlbear feather on it, and I put it down next to her because I know she loved owlbears.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me. Okay. Anybody else?
Liam: I pull Simon from around my waist, and I start to fasten it around her. This is yours. You're going to have to take care of him now. His name is Simon. Most people don't think he's alive, but they're wrong. He's very much alive. Take care of him for me. I didn't get nearly enough time with you. I'm sorry. I love you very much. I kiss her on the forehead.
Matt: Roll another d20.
Liam: I rolled an 18, but I'm going to use Luck. Good. 18 is good.
Matt: Okay.
Mary: I take the moonstone from my staff, and I clasp it in my hands, and I say: Sirius, you asked me to be here and to judge them. They are worthy. Give me this boon. Help me save this girl, for true friendship, which I never had until now. Help me save her. Help us all save her. And I place the moonstone down next to her head.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.
Mary: I'll use Luck.
Matt: If you want to.
Mary: 12.
Matt: Okay. As you complete the ritual, all the sigils in place lighting up, it's unique because you're used to the ritual completed by an acolyte of Sarenrae, in which everything has a glow of warmth to it. This ritual was completed by an acolyte of an entity named Vesh, and as each sigil flares, you watch as they darken into the deepest shadow. It's a yin-yang dichotomy as the spell begins to take effect, until eventually the whole circle becomes pitch black, like the deepest of lightless midnight. At that moment, you watch as Velora's form itself is also cast into shadow and disappears from view. And for a moment, you fear she is gone, before the shadow begins to peel away like a cocoon, and as it tears and rolls back, the subtle sound of sand shifting and paper crackling, you watch as her chest begins to move once more, breathing, her eyes still closed, but life breathes into her lungs once more. With a natural 19.
Laura: I hug her. Oh, and I pop Trinket out of his necklace, and I cast Cure Wounds on him so he can lick her face.
Matt: Okay. As Trinket comes out, Trinket is burned and battered, armor dinged up and screwed up, on his face it's askew to one side--
Travis: He got meteored. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, he did.
Travis: I didn't sign up for this shit.
Laura: I've still got a 3rd-level Cure Wounds on him.
Matt: All right.
Mary: I cast Beast Speak. You all right, Trinket?
Matt: "I don't care." And Trinket comes forward to Velora and begins licking her face, and she who is breathing but unconscious, the eye begins to slowly open. "What?" And her eyes open up a little bit, and you can see her skin darkened from the blast and the rubble and the dust that's now begun to settle around the base of Entropis, and she looks up and first sees the lapping tongue of Trinket against her cheek, and giggles and pushes him away a little bit. Then she sees the feather and looks at it and now looks up to see the person that's holding her and looks and meets both of your gazes--
Laura: Hi, little monkey.
Matt: "Hi."
Liam: You're an awfully long way from home.
Matt: "What happened?"
Laura: You went on an adventure, that's all.
Matt: She gets quiet for a second, trying to remember, trying to recall. "I'm very tired."
Laura: Of course.
Matt: And she curls up and pulls tighter around Vex's neck.
Will: Kash steps in. You don't feel evil, do you? (laughter)
Matt: She pulls back and looks over at you. "Who's this human?"
Laura: Oh, he saved your life just now, dear.
Liam: He's a friend. Come here.
Will: All right.
Laura: No, but seriously, could she be evil? Seriously.
Will: No, there's-- no. You feel okay?
Matt: She arranges the situation and looks back at you and goes, (giggles).
Will: She's fine. I'd watch her.
Laura: Yeah. She's fine. (laughter)
Matt: She pulls back into you and whispers in your ear and says, "He's pretty stupid, isn't he?"
Laura: He's really stupid.
Matt: She giggles and then sighs into you.
Laura: Okay, yeah. Just rest. I'm going to sit her on top of Trinket so she can take a little nappy-nap.
Matt: Okay. And she passes right out. She is spent. She is exhausted.
Will: The city is still burning.
Mary: Yes, it is. We have work to do.
Will: We've got a lot of people down there we know.
Mary: I know. The Slayer's Take is in desperate need. We should check on the sphinx.
Travis: The sphinx, right.
Laura: We can't thank you enough. Again.
Will: You guys always do throw the best parties, that's for sure.
Mary: Yes, you do.
Laura: I'm so glad you're all right.
Will: Yeah, I'm glad we could help. That's why we're going to name our child Vax. I'm totally kidding; that's never going to happen. (laughter)
Mary: Take the moonstone. Keep it with you. If you need me-- well, I won't come, because I'll be away, but--
Laura: Yeah, you'll be a little busy with the child and all.
Mary: A little busy, yes. But come and visit if you get a chance. Who knows? Twins runs in my family, so you never know.
Laura: Really?
Mary: Yes. Lillith told me. I need to see Lillith again.
Liam: Oh, the joke's on you.
Laura: I give her a big hug.
Mary: I love you, darling.
Laura: I love you so much. Congratulations.
Mary: Thank you, dearest. Scanlan.
Sam: Yes?
Mary: You little bastard.
Sam: Yes? That is my full name, yes. (laughter)
Mary: I plant a giant, fiery kiss on him, and my tail wraps around his head.
Sam: I try to get away, but--
Mary: The tail. (laughter)
Will: I told you.
Sam: You're right! Kinky. Ooh! What? I mean, thank you?
Mary: I miss doing your hair.
Sam: Well, I miss doing, well--
Mary: We'll see each other, again, I hope. Grog.
Travis: Yeah?
Mary: Use that moonhammer.
Travis: I will-- I mean, again.
Laura: At night. In the night.
Mary: Use it in the moon--
Travis: Yeah. Under the moon.
Laura: Yeah, obviously.
Travis: It's called a moonhammer. Yeah.
Mary: Use it in the moonlight. I think you'll be surprised.
Travis: In the nude.
Taliesin: Without pants.
Mary: Without pants.
Travis: Right. Yeah. Moon for moon, as above, so below--
Mary: Yes.
Travis: And that will unleash--
Mary: Take your pants off, here we go.
Liam: Double damage on cows. Yeah.
Travis: I'm going to fuck some cows up.
Mary: Yeah, you do.
Will: Oh, Grog. I love standing next to you in battle and hate standing next to you at the urinal. (laughter)
Will: That's just the way it is, my friend. Been a pleasure.
Mary: Percy.
Taliesin: Yes?
Mary: Take care of our girl.
Taliesin: I'll try.
Mary: Take care of her.
Taliesin: My regards to your family.
Mary: Thank you, love. We'll be in Whitestone again soon. I'll see you soon, dearest.
Sam: Don't see us too soon. I mean, whenever you're near us, you both almost die. So maybe just--
Laura: Give it some time.
Will: But we--
Will: Almost.
Mary: Almost.
Mary: That's the key word is almost, you see. Yes. You saved our lives. We can never repay you.
Travis: I believe you saved ours first by showing up.
Marisha: We saved each other. That's kind of what Vox Machina's all about.
Liam: This is the second time around you.
Mary: That's what we do for each other. I love you, Vax.
Liam: I love you, too, Mary.
Mary: Oh, baby, don't do that.
Matt: At this point, you begin to hear distant horns echoing throughout the city streets. Distant, emanating throughout. As you glance over, you haven't heard these horns before. But they sound less like horns of warning and more like horns of victory. Glancing down in the streets, there are still flames and columns of smoke and you can still see scuffles beneath. The siege weaponry attacks against the titan have subsided and it has not moved at all. It is locked in place, a large statuesque-like mountain of an ancient entity now lording over the edge of the Braving Grounds, almost creeping upon the outskirts of the Quad Roads towards the center of the city, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Most of the Braving Grounds is in tatters but--
Laura: I look at Percy. This would be a wonderful place for a summer home. (chuckles)
Will: We've got to go.
Mary: We've got to go.
Sam: What? No.
Mary: We have to leave.
Will: They need us back.
Mary: Yeah.
Liam: Don't be strangers, though.
Mary: We won't.
Liam: Look in.
Laura: Thank you, guys.
Mary: We will.
Liam: Look in if you can.
Mary: We love you all so much.
Travis: Thank you.
Taliesin: Thank you, as well.
Will: So this is what it's like to have a family, huh?
Mary: Yeah.
Will: I can get used to that.
Marisha: Sounds like you're going to have an actual family soon.
Sam: Well I shit more than your kid will, but other than that, it's like this but with less shit.
Will: Then we'll be happy.
Mary: Always.
Will: Call us if you need us. Anytime.
Laura: Same.
Mary: We'll be here.
Laura: All right.
Mary: Thank you.
Will: Luck in battle.
Sam: Thank you.
Laura: Bye loves.
Liam: See you later, smart ass.
Mary: Thank you.
Will: Bastard. Treat her well or I'm going to come back.
Laura: Hey, you've got your hands full, all right?
Will: That's true, too.
Matt: And as she completes a secondary Fly spell, these two coast off over the edge of Thar Amphala, down into the center of Vasselheim on their own. At which point, you notice three battle-disheveled wyvern riders that were waiting at the side begin to approach. One of them you recognize as a captain signified by these ivory horns that curl out of the back of the helmet and grow longer than the regular wyvern riders' armor you've encountered. Having stepped off the armored drake that currently waits, shaking its head, large leathery wings dug into the nearby rubble, the warrior approaches, pulling the helmet off, revealing a tumble of braided amber hair with shaved sides and a rather stern-looking woman that you don't recognise. "Vox Machina! I am Captain Obelin. I would ask, does this shift in tide signify anything? Does the lich still loom about?"
Laura: He fucking dead.
Taliesin: Does not. The battle is won.
Laura: He's been sealed away.
Matt: "It is done?"
Travis: It is.
Taliesin: "Fucking dead." (laughter)
Travis: Lady Vex'ahlia.
Taliesin: Lady, yes.
Matt: "The gods grant their grace upon Vasselheim still. We thank you. Well, there's little time to celebrate. There's still much to be done, but please bring this information to the Platinum Sanctuary, to somewhere of significance in the city. This information needs to go out. this will greatly bolster the ranks, morale of those--"
Marisha: Start spreading the word yourself. You can help us out, right?
Matt: "Oh, we shall." She looks over her shoulder at the other soldiers.
Taliesin: I've got the last flare from Whitestone from all those years ago.
Laura: I have a purple flare too. We should all set them off.
Marisha: I was going to say  I think I still have a Skywrite.
Sam: Let's do it.
Marisha: Yep.
Laura: I send up my purple flare, too.
Sam: I pull out my gun. (laughter)
Travis: Yes!
Marisha: Oh my god!
Travis: I forgot you have one.
Liam: What a callback.
Taliesin: I've been waiting for it.
Travis: Please misfire. Please blow your hand off.
Sam: Let's do this. (yells) (laughter)
Matt: Okay. Roll a d20.
Travis: Please.
Taliesin: No!
Sam: Natural 20.
Taliesin: No!
Sam: (machine gun noises)
Liam: Say hello to my even littler friend!
Travis: Oh my god.
Matt: So as you guys send up your colored Whitestone crest flares into the sky, what do you Skywrite?
Marisha: Vecna defeated.
Laura: That's a lot of writing.
Taliesin: That's a lot of words.
Matt: The wisps of cloud begin to spell across--
Sam: V def.
Marisha: (laughs) I can write it out.
Taliesin: You can.
Matt: Yeah. As it coasts across, you hear this loud echoing (gunshot) as the N in the middle of Vecna seems to dissipate with a little puff as a perfectly aimed bullet from one pistol that does not backfire, because that would have been fucking funny.
Taliesin: It's all I wanted tonight.
Travis: So good.
Matt: Roll a performance check.
Sam: Performance? Come on. 28.
Matt: 28. For a man who has only shot a pistol once, he Revolver Ocelots that shit.
Laura: He's been practicing that shit in his bedroom.
Marisha: Yeah. In the mirror.
Travis: Behind the back. Oh shit. (laughter)
Sam: I've been watching you.
Travis: Percy's like, "I don't do that shit." (laughter)
Taliesin: Yeah, no.
Matt: These flares bursting and slowly descending, coming down and bringing this-- it was a purple flare and what was the color of yours?
Taliesin: Gold, if I recall.
Matt: So gold and purple begin to burn down below, giving this strange atmospheric light to the outside of the large, still titan form as the words across the sky, you begin to hear this low gathering of cheers. Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of voices where you once heard screaming and yelling now join in unison. A rallying cry of victory that crawls across the entirety of Vasselheim around you on all sides. What do you guys want to do?
Travis: I need that hand.
Sam: Do we have Locate Object or something?
Liam: I do.
Laura: I mean, yeah.
Sam: Is it an object? I guess it's inanimate now.
Matt: It is considered an object now.
Liam: I do.
Laura: That's good.
Liam: I got it. I've seen it. I have the spell slot.
Matt: All right. So you cast Locate Object and you have a very strong vision of the direction and it's maybe a hundred feet to your left, and it is under quite a bit of rubble.
Liam: Big man, come on. I'm going to need you to dig; it's over here.
Travis: Not a problem.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Rage dig.
Matt: Giving him direction. Rage-digging through, tossing veritable small boulders with one-handed scoops. You guys are having to dodge out of the way as they go flying by and skidding to a halt maybe 50, 60 feet behind him. Go ahead and make an investigation check with advantage, because of his aid.
Travis: That's about as good as it gets, because that's even worse. 16.
Matt: 16. Okay.
Travis: With a minus two.
Matt: It takes you a little while, but thanks to Locate Object, you cruise through and you eventually find-- It's been smashed, but it's still intact and there you see the completely cut off, red-scaled, clawed hand of Arkhan the Cruel.
Travis: He fucked us.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: He helped us. And then he fucked us. Yeah.
Marisha: I guess the help was worth the fucking, but only a little bit.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: The voice creeps into your head. "Take it. Find him. He has to die."
Travis: Feel like I should take this and try and find him. He's got to fucking die.
Laura: Yeah, he probably does.
Travis: He was so cool and strong and only his physique rivals my own, but I feel like he's got to die.
Liam: Please. He couldn't touch you, are you kidding?
Marisha: You know, you're not having--
Travis: Couldn't.
Laura: You seem to like him a lot. Are you sure you want to kill him and not just try to get--
Marisha: Grog.
Travis: What? Hold on.
Marisha: We all think you're strong. You don't need to have an inferiority complex.
Travis: A what?
Laura: Yeah, I don't think he's going to understand.
Liam: I don't think he has those.
Travis: So he's a paladin of--
Sam: Tiamat.
Travis: Right. Is that a good or a bad?
Sam: Bad, I'm guessing?
Matt: Make a religion check with advantage because you still have-- well, the blessing would have worn off.
Liam: That thing could rot. Do you know what preserves a hand?
Laura: The bag of colding.
Sam: More than 20.
Matt: Yeah, Tiamat's very bad. Known as the Scaled Tyrant, she resides in the Nine Hells and is the patron deity of all chromatic dragons.
Sam: Oh, yeah. She's the dragon god. She?
Matt: She. The opposite of Bahamut.
Travis: Of good dragons, or bad?
Sam: Bad dragons.
Travis: Okay. I feel like he had a good insight, but the hand does bad things, right?
Laura: The hand does really bad things. You know what you should do is bring that to Bahamut.
Liam: Yeah, after you piss on it.
Marisha: Why are you so connected to the pissing thing?
Laura: Don't piss on it, Grog.
Travis: But he said preserve it.
Laura: But then maybe if they try to use the hand to find it, it might lead them to you instead because you've already pissed on it.
Travis: Lead them to my junk?
Laura: Potentially.
Travis: People have come looking for it for less.
Laura: You don't want people chopping off your junk thinking your junk is Vecna's hand, do you?
Travis: It doesn't even look like a hand. Just like one really big middle finger. (laughter)
Liam: It's like a mole, right?
Travis: Yeah. All right, I have it. I'm not going to preserve it.
Laura: Put it in the bag of colding.
Liam: Such a mistake.
Sam: That's on the to-do list. We'll go find him.
Laura: All right.
Travis: And Bahamut is the platinum--
Laura: Tiamat's the bad guy.
Travis: No, Bahamut is the good dragon of the platinum variety?
All: Yes.
Travis: Would you say they are at odds?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Safe bet.
Travis: Like Godzilla and King Kong?
Liam: I don't know those references, but yeah, they are at odds.
Marisha: What's-her-name worshipped Bahamut.
Laura: Kima.
Marisha: Was it Kima? Kima! Kima worships Bahamut.
Travis: She was badass.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Travis: I'll just hold on to the hand right now.
Laura: What's going on there, Grog?
Travis: Nothing. We just had a big fight.
Taliesin: You're making that monologue face. Like that face someone makes when they're listening to some very complex internal monologue. You don't make that face very often. You're making it right now. Just start speaking whatever's in your head right now. Free-form.
Travis: I have to go after the hand, I must kill Vecna, I have to do these things.
Taliesin: Okay, this is starting to paint a picture. You feel better now?
Travis: Nuh-huh.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Is that going on all the time in your head?
Travis: No.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: Are you lying right now?
Sam: He nodded when he said no.
Liam: DM, just for funsies, do I sense Vecna in any way, shape, or form?
Matt: No.
Liam: Okay. Definitely want to piss on that hand, Grog.
Laura: Don't piss on the hand. Number one  it's already in the bag of colding and I don't want everything else pissed on.
Liam: Grog and I don't share much!
Taliesin: Except pissing? (laughter)
Taliesin: It was an honest question.
Travis: That's true.
Laura: What should we do, you guys?
Taliesin: I'm so tired.
Marisha: I grab onto Vax and don't let go.
Sam: We have more pressing concerns.
Taliesin: That does remind me. Scanlan?
Sam: What?
Taliesin: You're going to have to give it back now.
Sam: Give what back?
Taliesin: You know exactly what.
Sam: The gun?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: That was part of a trade.
Sam: This is my gun.
Taliesin: I don't think it's your gun.
Sam: I found it.
Taliesin: You didn't.
Travis: No, there was a trade of items. I got a cloak of smashing out of it, and you got... other stuff.
Sam: I found it fair and square; it's my gun.
Taliesin: There's no fair and square. And honestly, if you were anybody else, I would find it when I was rummaging through your corpse later. But it's you. So instead I just use my words, and I'm trying to be a better person. If you really like it, maybe we'll have a special one made that's a little safer. But not that one. That's one of mine.
Sam: I look so cool.
Taliesin: I'll make you something fancy that's a little less prone to explode.
Liam: Scanlan, you should know you always look cool. Always.
Taliesin: Especially with the head thing. It's quite nice.
Marisha: Yeah, this is awesome. Does he still have the blessing?
Matt: The blessing has faded by now.
Taliesin: You should get that tattooed in permanently.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: That's a good idea.
Taliesin: That's a really good idea.
Marisha: I can draw on you with the remaining remnants. That way you have it there, always.
Sam: I love it.
Marisha: Okay. I try to draw the outline of the remaining glyph on his head.
Matt: So you take some ash and charcoal from the nearby rubble and loosely draw the symbol on his forehead. Roll a dexterity check.
Marisha: Okay. Straight dex? Don't fuck me, Gil! 14.
Matt: 14. It's passable.
Marisha: Yeah, that right there. That's perfect. Get that tattooed.
Sam: All right. It's going to happen. I feel like we should all get a tattoo to commemorate this.
Taliesin: On the forehead?
Laura: Definitely on the forehead.
Marisha: Definitely on the forehead.
Liam: Well, maybe in different places. We don't all need to get it in the same place. Maybe on a theme, but not the exact same thing?
Laura: We already all got tattoos, didn't we?
Taliesin: Well, we got tattoos. That's all that matters.
Travis: No, we didn't.
Marisha: I'm not sure what we're talking about anymore.
Laura: No, I thought we got them in character.
Marisha: No, he got them.
Liam: I got one. And I got one.
Laura: Oh, we got the Slayer's Take.
Marisha: Wait, we're branded, and then I've got mine, and then he has his.
Liam: I have the burnt hand on my back. Elven. No, it's not mostly healed. Scanlan Shorthalt! You don't need a gun to look cool. You are the Meat Man. You are Burt Reynolds. You are a fucking hero.
Sam: I'm going to throw it away. Wrist Pocket! (laughter)
Matt: Make a sleight of hand check.
Sam: Nine. 12.
Matt: 12?
Marisha: Bullshit! My passive perception is 21.
Matt: Yeah, you guys totally see him. It's the worst example--
Liam: That's the trick I do for my eight-year-old!
Taliesin: Look at it go! Wow! (laughter)
Travis: You caught it?! You threw it--
Sam: Around the world.
Travis: Oh my god! (laughter)
Travis: I faint. (laughter)
Laura: Hey, while he's out, should we get this sword off him?
Liam: Why?
Laura: Because it seems like he's a little weird from it. Nobody else feels that way?
Taliesin: I think so.
Travis: (gasps) You're so strong. What'd I miss?
Laura: Nothing.
Marisha: We were talking about you. I mean, we were talking about-- sorry, I'm still working on it.
Laura: Yeah, no, it's getting better. Should we get off of the titan, maybe?
Sam: It could fall.
Taliesin: Does anyone want to start walking towards the city to see how bad it really is?
Laura: We'll have to get through the titan, or we can fly down. Outside of that, I don't know.
Sam: How many of us can fly? Well, I guess we could take a couple of trips on the carpet.
Taliesin: We've got a carpet. Some of us have wings.
Liam: My wings are gone.
Marisha: My wings are gone.
Matt: Yeah, your wings are gone. Pike's wings are gone. You guys have your broom; you have the carpet.
Sam: So we can take three trips on the carpet, or something?
Taliesin: We can ride on the broom.
Marisha: Have we taken a short rest, at this point?
Matt: Yeah, you guys would have taken a short rest, at this point.
Marisha: My beast shape's back.
Matt: I'll say for the purposes of when you were helping with the ritual that he was casting, because that's an hour long, that would have been a short rest, easy.
Liam: What are you going to be?
Marisha: Well, what do you want to fly in on? What do you want?
Liam: Dragon?
Marisha: I can't do that. I can do anything in the animal kingdom.
Travis: Before we go down, before we leave, what about Sylas?
Laura: (gasps) Sylas.
Marisha: He flew away.
Laura: Right, but he's repairing somewhere.
Travis: They have coffins, right?
Liam: We deduced that it doesn't take him that long to come back together. And it's been--
Matt: Not terribly long.
Liam: But we're right at that cutoff point.
Matt: Maybe.
Taliesin: Try to scry on him! He's probably having a bad day. There's enough time.
Marisha: I'll scry on him.
Taliesin: There's a gold dragon that should be--
Marisha: Oh, I haven't used any of my 5th-level spells!
Laura: Do you have Daylight, still? Something with sun? I guess sunlight would take him out, because it's during the day.
Marisha: Yeah. I still have 3rd-level spells. Yep. I also have my 6th-level spells. I have Sunbeam learned, which is dope.
Liam: That's all you need.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to scry on him.
Taliesin: Grog, do you want to trade boots, by the way, again?
Matt: Okay, and he's used all of his resistances.
Taliesin: We don't have to, if you really like them.
Marisha: He's used all of his legendary resistances? Is that what that was?
Matt: Yeah. That is a natural 19 plus seven wisdom save. So that's a 26.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Sam: He beat your scry?
Marisha: He rolled a natural 19?
Matt: Natural 19.
Laura: You can't do it?
Marisha: I can do it again. Can I do it again?
Matt: If you have another spell slot for it.
Marisha: I do it again!
Matt: Natural 16 plus seven. So that's a 23.
Sam: That wins.
Laura: Can I try to cast Locate Object on the pants he was wearing?
Liam: That's amazing!
Laura: They're an object.
Taliesin: She has seen them.
Laura: I've seen them!
Taliesin: They're very nice.
Matt: Let me consult the verbiage of--
Liam: This is amazing, and I love you. That is amazing!
Taliesin: That is the greatest thing I've ever heard. Locate Pants. I would like to scry upon the pants. The pantalones.
Liam: On his loafers.
Matt: Okay. All right, cool. And you have a 2nd-level spell slot for this?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: So as you complete the spell and try to focus as hard as you can on the pants of Lord Sylas Briarwood--
Taliesin: He has pajamas he changes into.
Liam: They're Batman pajamas.
Matt: Nothing.
Laura: Nothing? He's definitely recovering naked. Fuck! Nothing.
Marisha: No pants?
Laura: No pants.
Liam: He's in the buck!
Marisha: You guys! He's shirt-cocking somewhere! (laughter)
Matt: He prepared! He knew! "It's the only way they won't find me!" He pulls his tearaways off and chucks them.
Travis: Just goes up and says hi to people.
Marisha: Flashing innocents through all the city!
Matt: It's his dominate action.
Travis: Yeah, right!
Laura: We're going to have to worry about him at some point.
Sam: Not now.
Marisha: I can try and scrying eye him. I also still have one more 5th-level spell.
Laura: Yeah, but how are we going to take him out if you use all your spells to find him?
Marisha: I have a 6th.
Travis: Maybe we let him go.
Liam: She's saying you got one more shot, and we still have some sunlight.
Laura: One more time.
Marisha: One more time.
Matt: Well, you used the scrying eye before you took the long rest in the Feywild, or was it after?
Liam: That was for finding the Sword of Kas, wasn't it, before we slept?
Matt: Yeah, that would have been before. Yeah, okay. So you can use it.
Marisha: But I'm using my 5th-level spell first.
Matt: Okay, you are?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm using my 3rd.
Matt: That's a natural seven.
Sam: That could work.
Matt: As you close your eyes and focus, trying desperately to find the location of Sylas Briarwood, your vision pulls back and is thrust past the titan, and there's a flash of movement. You're suddenly seeing trees. You're sensing somewhere in the thick forest of the Vasper Timberlands. And there, you focus on rapidly flapping bat wings.
Marisha: Still trying to get back? He's still trying to get back!
Matt: You don't know. He's in the forest somewhere. He's in a deep forest with bits of snow around him. And you're only catching glimpses of it as he goes through the shadowed underbrush.
Marisha: No type of landmark?
Matt: Just trees, endless trees.
Laura: He's running away.
Taliesin: I would run if I were him.
Sam: Deal with him another day.
Marisha: He's in the Vasper forest.
Liam: Well, we'll never see him again.
Taliesin: He may finally have had enough.
Marisha: Do you ever think there's a chance for Lady Briarwood to come back?
Laura: I don't think so.
Travis: Never say never.
Liam: Never say never.
Taliesin: Never say never, but probably not.
Laura: I mean, if we can bring people back, they might be able to.
Travis: That's a good point.
Taliesin: He would have to work very hard to make it happen.
Travis: We're going to live a life of paranoia, aren't we?
Taliesin: Well, we knew that going in.
Sam: We'll be okay.
Laura: So do we go see the leaders here?
Sam: Yeah. Let's go.
Taliesin: Let's go see who's left.
Matt: All right.
Sam: To the platinum temple?
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, around the corner, you see there's a few of the eagle riders that are getting on their eagle back and flying off. There is one figure that stays behind and that turns around and begins to walk your direction. In the chaos, you hadn't noticed that when Vecna had been dispelled, the force cage that had maintained and locked in J'mon Sa Ord had vanished. You see them turn around and look towards you in humanoid form. They approach with the long, jet-black hair, the darkened skin, the beautiful coal-like ember eyes. Tall, almost as tall as Grog, though lithe in form and simply clothed. J'mon approaches. "Well, I'm certainly impressed. I apologize to have not been as much help as I had hoped."
Laura: That was a shitty spell he cast.
Matt: "It seems to be his forte. Nonetheless, the least I can do is offer you a way into the city."
Travis: That would be lovely.
Matt: "I would like to speak with the council that remains, as well. Come with me." J'mon turns around and steps about 20 feet away before the wings sprout out of their back and stretch to each side. You see the large brass dragon form expand, the claws (impact) onto the ground. As they turn their head back over their shoulder, the deep voice of the dragon form: "Hop on."
Laura: I'm going to hold on to Velora. And Trinket, I swear it's going to be the last time, buddy. I'm not going to keep making you go in this necklace much more.
Matt: (bear grunts) Licks the side of your cheek. And closes his eyes, waiting for it.
Laura: Ooh, I love him so much.
Matt: Into the necklace.
Liam: And as Vax and Keyleth get situated on J'mon's back, I whisper in her ears: I was going to say eagle. Giant eagle.
Marisha: Yeah. That's good to know.
Travis: I pick up Pike and put her on my shoulders. Get on the dragon.
Matt: Okay. Pike climbs up, now wingless. "Thank you." Grabs onto the belt you have across your chest.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right. So do you all climb up onto J'mon's back?
Sam: Absolutely.
Matt: All right. J'mon, in Devo'ssa form, then begins to run at a fast speed towards the edge of the city. Eventually, the wings begin to flap, and with one giant thrust of wind, ascends. And once again, you feel the wind rocket through your hair, as was your entry towards the titan. You begin to crest over the edge of Thar Amphala, over the titan, and down towards the center of Vasselheim, the wind roaring past your face, your cloaks whipping behind you. You have a bird's-eye view of the city that you've essentially saved. And really, did so through a quick jaunt to the Feywild. The Braving Grounds still, while in severe disarray and flames still burn, most everything's under control now. Whatever remains of the remnant cultists, warriors, and undead have either been destroyed, captured, or run out of the city. As you pick up 40, 50 feet over the rooftops, you see as hundreds of survivors have haphazardly armed Bastions, as civilians of Vasselheim have picked up whatever arms were available, of soldiers in the streets, children holding the hands of their families, all glance up and point at the majestic brass dragon that coasts not more than maybe 40, 50 feet ahead, signifying once more a symbol of hope and victory. You hear the shouts behind you. As you begin to make your way around the Heaven's Stair mountain and then up, gliding over the steps leading up towards the platinum sanctuary. As you begin to glide up, you can see the steps are littered with broken bone, splatters of blood, broken bodies and silvered armor, and familiar black sludge, connoting the remains of slain gloomstalkers. The immediate ground conflict is over here and has been for some time. The stillness is now occupied with clusters of wounded riders and platinum warriors that now rest atop the apex of the stair and the sanctuary platform itself before you approach the entryway in the pillars. As you ascend, floating up, Devo'ssa lands right at the top of the stair as all the soldiers and medics who are in the process of handling the wounded, gathering the dead, all stop and look at the majestic brass dragon form as they lower themselves to allow each of you to carefully step off. As you do, you watch as the chatter, the conversation, the quiver of worry, the intensity of the recovery, comes to stillness as each of the soldiers, even those who have seen better days, stand up with a look of acknowledgment, greeting you as you arrive, and all give a respectful bow of the head or kneel to you as you approach and pass by. In the stillness, you begin to walk towards the opening of the sanctuary, the doors open already, and glance over your shoulder to see that J'mon has retaken their human form and is now walking at your side. Entering the sanctuary, you can see folks are rushing around a bit, and they notice your arrival, as well, but are also trying to make sure that everything is accounted for, and there's a bit of hustle and bustle. The old Scalebearer Yon, who greeted you first to Vasselheim, approaches quickly. "Oh, goodness me! Hello? You're well. You've looked better, but so have we. That's fine. I have questions to ask. But perhaps it's best that-- come with me." And darts back towards the central meeting chambers of the Platinum Sanctuary. You can see the circle of pillars that surround the wide marbled floors of the center chamber where all these council meetings have previously taken place. You can see battle has taken place here. While most of the bodies or the wounded or dead have been removed at this point, you can see there are elements of chipped and broken stone and marble. You can see scattered remains and blood stains at points towards the entryway. But most of it appears to have been halted at the entryway. All of the combat has halted within the sanctuary. Glancing past, you can see most of the council you met last is not here. They're probably handling their various portions of the city. But you do see amongst a number of inner guardians of the sanctuary Highbearer Vord, who himself looks like he's seen a bit of a fray, and Allura Vysoren to his side. Both harried, but alive. As soon as you begin to approach, their conversation comes to a halt. As Allura turns and sees you all, her face brightens and she immediately rushes up, tossing any sort of formalities to the side, and runs up. Before she can give you a hug, she sees the child in your arms.
Laura: She's all right.
Matt: "I'm so glad."
Marisha: Yeah, group hug!
Matt: She pulls you in, and you all bundle into this big group hug, heaving breaths of relief cascade through your grouping. You hear the throat clear behind as Vord goes, (clears throat).
Travis: Decorum.
Laura: How's Kima?
Matt: "I assume she's well. She's been doing what she does best, which is wander the streets, destroying things that she doesn't like. I've been keeping a close eye from a distance as best I can. She seems all right."
Taliesin: Any word from Gilmore in the last hour?
Matt: "No, why?"
Marisha: He was in the tower. He was a decoy; we almost slayed him.
Laura: He'd been taken.
Liam: He's all right.
Taliesin: He's all right.
Sam: Do we know where he teleported off to?
Marisha: We sent him off with Cassandra.
Taliesin: Into the woods.
Laura: Into the wood.
Sam: Don't worry, it's a big woods. It'll be okay.
Liam: This city still stands. You have carried out a miracle.
Matt: "I've done nothing. Word seems to--" And at that point, she gets cut off by Highbearer Vord, who steps forward, his arms crossed. "Word seems to have spread, and I wish not to celebrate prematurely. I have reports that you were there, that you did battle with this ancient beast. What is your assurance? What is your confidence that this is indeed over, and we're not lulled into a false sense of security?"
Travis: We're pretty sure he's alive and well. You know, he's a threat right now. (whispering) What, do we have proof?
Laura: Oh, proof.
Taliesin: I've never known a true sense of security. I'm not entirely sure.
Sam: The proof is we're here and we're alive.
Laura: And that titan has stopped moving.
Liam: I am the champion of the Raven Queen. And she has allowed me to track his every movement for a while now.
Matt: "I recall you mentioning that when we last met."
Liam: He's gone.
Travis: There was a process. We had trammels.
Laura: You remembered the word.
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Do I still have the remains of the broken trammel or did it shatter?
Matt: No, that shit shattered. It turned to dust.
Laura: Yeah, glitter bomb. Oh, glitter-bomb Vecna! I like the idea that he got glitter-bombed.
Matt: "That was my good eye!" (laughter)
Matt: All right. You see, as you guys are discussing, the Highbearer's eyes lock to Vax's, and you see softness return to his face. The tension, the unknowing, begins to subside with a smile, comes across his stilted, older elvish visage. "You all. There was a time I did not look past your beginnings. I am ashamed at my misjudgment." He looks around as folks begin to gather. He acknowledges J'mon, who's approached. They've bowed, carefully. "Many heroes rose to challenge this day. Many we've lost. And many others that remain to remember them. Let us vow to never forget those who gave everything so that we could still stand here to remember. You, Vox Machina, stand as that beacon of hope upon which we all we hold. You may not fully understand the scope of what you have done but I assure you, we do. And we will. We humble of Vasselheim are eternally in your debt. As is much of the ignorant world, perhaps. On behalf of Silver Talon's Reach, I thank you for everything." The rest of the room who's begun to gather now, you see other soldiers that were waiting outside as you first approached have begun to filter in. And as you glance back towards the entry hallway of the Platinum Sanctuary, you see faces. People that greeted you in. People hearing these words resounding in silence, and they all begin to bow low.
Laura: This is weird.
Sam: Should we say something?
Travis: Ask for money?
Laura: They haven't done our fees, right?
Marisha: I'm supremely uncomfortable.
Sam: You are the leader of your people. Maybe you should say something.
Marisha: What?
Sam: You're a leader!
Marisha: No! But I'm not a leader of these people.
Laura: You've been giving us really good inspirational speeches. Get up and say something.
Taliesin: Get up and say something.
Laura: Say something really awesome.
Taliesin: Just tell people it was brilliant and great.
Marisha: Okay. I step forward.
Matt: So as you stand here amongst this procession of warriors, people that now look up and don't see Keyleth the druid, they see the Voice of the Tempest. They see one of the as-to-probably-be-remembered saviors of the city and beyond. All eyes are on you as Highbearer Vord steps away.
Liam: I'm still holding your hand.
Marisha: (chuckles, sighs) The bravery of Vasselheim remains evident on this day, and you all should be proud that your reputation of a city unfallen by invasion or attack remains, and that is only because of the faith and the bravery and the strength of the citizens of this amazing city. We of Vox Machina are proud and honored to have fought by every single one of you, and we vow to continue to stand by your side through the rest of our days. Huzzah!
All: Huzzah! (cheering)
Ashley: Hey, can you hear me?
Matt: With a wave of cheers that roar from within these marbled halls that echo, boom and reverberate--
Marisha: To 1,000 years of Vasselheim! Huzzah!
Matt: Cheers and cries and fists raise and Pike's cheering--
Ashley: Yay! (laughter)
Matt: You see Velora pull away from Allura's arm, who's come by to help you carry her, and she: (weakly) "Yay." And Allura looks to you with an absolute look of respect and pride. Even the Highbearer seems to be taken by the words. Shit, everyone in the room gets temporary hit points, practically.
Marisha: Yeah! 20 hit points now.
Matt: The sun-glass roof, which currently has been sitting within the shadow of the mountain, the sunlight begins to peak past and glide its way across the marble floor as everyone's cheering and the room now, which once was in shadow of the mountain, is now lit up with sunlight. Now you can see the glittering armor that peeks through the dirt, the grime, the blood, shining and sparkling on each of you, across Pike's beautiful armor, across all the warriors that stand here, across the Scalebearer's design, across your hair. The room is filled with light and though you sense the presence of probably Bahamut, glancing down you can't help but think that this is also the approving glance of Pelor, perhaps a bit of the Everlight. As the cheers begin to fade, the crowd begins to pull away. Conversations progress, thank-yous are given, people come up to you. And eventually you guys begin to step out of the Sanctuary and there you look down across the upper platform, looking down over the city. You can see the Birthheart, the Duskmeadow, pillars of smoke rising up as the sun now hangs high in the sky. A cold sensation takes you in the chest, Vax. A small pain. A second one. And your eyes shoot over across to the Raven's Crest, damaged but still standing. You turn around to look at the rest of your family and as you guys look at his face, in but a flash you can see this dark shape behind him. This looming black cloak, this lithe dress that cascades down into a bell and drags across the ground. And there you see the form of the Raven Queen, porcelain mask, long dark hair behind, as her hands slowly creep over the shoulders of Vax'ildan.
Taliesin: I walk to step in between.
Matt: In between the two of them?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: While the lips do not move on this mask, the voice in your head says, "You've done well, but do not approach. This is not for you."
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: Do you recall what you told me once?
Matt: No response. Do you continue to walk?
Taliesin: I do.
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: Percy.
Taliesin: No. No, that's-- actually, you know what? Hey, that's right. I'm going to Resolve that.
Liam: Freddie.
Taliesin: This is not about you. That's a 19, 22.
Matt: That does not do it.
Taliesin: Damn it. I have a 19.
Matt: I know. Muscles lock into place and you find yourself held there on your third step. The voice, which is omnipresent in your mind, all about, continues. Soothing. Cold, distant but still soothing. The mask slowly looks down towards you. "You have done well, my champion. The skein of destiny has tugged in your wake, and even this victory culminates with the crossing of a few fate-touched souls. By your hand, your bravery, your sacrifice, you ensure a future for all you love and all who will come to love you and what you've done. You may never know the import of your time here, but take solace in the knowledge that you will see the ripples of your actions carry hope for generations to come. My Vax'ildan. It is time. Say your goodbyes, then come join my side." And the hands pull away. She stands there.
Sam: Now? We don't even get a night together or anything?
Marisha: It's not fair.
Laura: We've got a really long time to be alive. You've got an infinite time. What's a few more years?
Marisha: He sacrificed himself in your name; you remain the only ascended. And yet he still loses?
Matt: "He does not lose. The gifts I gave, indeed all of your patrons gave, were so that you," and you watch as her hands extend almost impossibly long around her, "and everyone here still stands. I understand selfishness. I understand the impulse of mortality. But I would hope that you understand that the actions that you've allowed Vax'ildan in this sacrifice are far larger. But we made a deal. With power comes a price."
Marisha: I'm not ready.
Liam: You're ready for your people.
Marisha: Not without you.
Liam: I am so very proud of you, and so grateful for everything you gave to me. You are going to be a strong leader and a wise leader.
Marisha: I'll find you. I promise. I'll see you again.
Liam: I'll never be that far away.
Marisha: Forever.
Liam: And ever and always. Boys. My brothers... I love you.
Sam: We love you, too. Thank you for everything. If you want us to fight her, just say jenga, and we will.
Liam: Maybe from the other side. Someday, just for shits and giggles.
Travis: Can I ask, are you afraid?
Liam: I'm going to go visit my mother, and I'll see all of you again. Freddie.
Taliesin: I do not accept this.
Liam: I know. But I charge you to take good care of my sister and love her. And your friend Keyleth, love her, as well. She will need it. She will need friends.
Taliesin: Of course.
Liam: Thank you for trying.
Sam: I wish I could have done more.
Liam: You did everything. Pickle? Pickle, you showed me the way. I know it doesn't look like that right now, but you absolutely did.
Ashley: I wish I could restore you.
Liam: (chuckles) You taught me purpose, Pickle. Purpose. And I know I will see you again.
Ashley: Isn't there--
Sam: She said is there something we can do? It's hard to hear her.
Liam: Be there for them. You be there for them. You're the light in all our lives.
Laura: No.
Liam: I never had a greater friend than you. And we traveled a lot, I never had a greater friend than you.
Laura: I feel like she's taking part of me away.
Liam: I will bring it with me to remind me of you.
Laura: I don't know how to live.
Liam: I will see you again.
Laura: I know.
Liam: I will see you again. And I will tell your mother that you say hello.
Laura: Please. I love you. I don't accept this.
Liam: I know that it's hard. And I am sorry.
Laura: I'm going to find you.
Liam: I take Keyleth's face in my hands and happily take one more kiss. I'm sorry it's so cold.
Marisha: I don't care. I don't accept this. I love you.
Liam: I will never stop loving you.
Marisha: This isn't fair.
Liam: I know.
Marisha: I guess we have to say goodbye.
Liam: For now. I love you, Keyleth of the Air Ashari.
Marisha: I love you, Vax'ildan. I'll see you again.
Liam: I look to the Raven Queen and as I walk closer, since I leveled up, I use the druid cantrip Druidcraft and grow snowdrops out from where I stand, out to all of my family. Out to where they stand. S.H.I.T.s, thank you. How lucky I have been to have had all of you. How lucky, indeed. Thank you.
Matt: And he turns and walks towards the darkened cloak of his matron. In the darkness of her cloak, you see a brief light, and it's brighter for you. As you walk forward, you see reaching from the light the dark hair, the fair skin, and the wide smile of your mother, Elaina. As she greets you, she says, "I'm so proud." The rest of you watch as her cloak begins to fade like a slowly scattered shadow in creeping sunlight. And as the snowdrop flowers continue with each step, you blink, and it's just feathers. We're going to take a break, we'll be back here in a few minutes, guys. (heavy exhale) Still more of this story to tell. See you guys in a bit. [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So before we jump back in, our winner in the chat of the giveaway is Mister Milgram. Congratulations. Danoba will reach out to you and get your contact information and get your prize sent off to you, so well done. All right, so. Bringing us back in.
Taliesin: No.
Sam: Something feels different about the table.
Matt: Yeah. As the cold wind subsides and the feathers glide through the wind off the edge of the Silver Talon's Reach, pinnacle of Platinum Sanctuary, you gather your thoughts. Quiet creeps over.
Sam: I feel like I could have taken her if I had a gun. I'm just saying.
Marisha: Scanlan, have we ever told you you're an asshole?
Sam: All the time.
Taliesin: I use Manners on Scanlan.
Matt: All right. What's the save on that?
Taliesin: Wow. Where is it?
Marisha: You got to sort through all your coffee stains.
Taliesin: These are my coffee stains.
Marisha: He's really irritable.
Sam: Jesus, you have so many things.
Taliesin: Yes, I do. It's a--
Laura: I hug Trinket.
Taliesin: Ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to my dex modifier plus my proficiency bonus.
Marisha: Keyleth sits next to Vex and lays her head on her shoulder.
Sam: Against AC?
Taliesin: Against you.
Sam: Oh. (laughs) I'm out.
Taliesin: Yeah. That's a six, 12, 24, I think.
Matt: Okay and what's the-- or it just hits and he has to make--
Taliesin: It just hits. You can make a strength check against 20.
Matt: To try and break out of it as an action, right? So as you finish your statement, Percival throws an orb at you and it expands, locks you up into this cage of metal bars and claws and chains, and you're locked in place, unable to move.
Sam: Feels right.
Travis: Was that necessary?
Taliesin: I'll let him out when I'm feeling like it.
Travis: Makes sense.
Marisha: I don't have the strength to argue with him.
Laura: Sorry, Scanlan.
Sam: (muffled) It's okay. I'm okay in here.
Taliesin: Actually, I'll unlock it so he can say that.
Sam: Oh, hi. That was a very touching ceremony. Well, I'll just be in here, crying.
Marisha: Aw.
Laura: Percy, please let him out, I can't take it right now.
Taliesin: I very quickly go through Scanlan's pockets to make sure there's nothing else that I need to take back from him.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Thank you. Nope. I let him out. Manners.
Marisha: That might be the last natural one of this campaign. You have to scream it from a mountaintop, man.
Sam: The golden snitch!
Laura: How could you do that?
Marisha: Betrayal.
Matt: It's mine now. (laughter)
Travis: A celestial hand reaches out of the clouds.
Matt: Hello, next campaign.
Laura: Oh shit.
Marisha: One man's trash.
Laura: Keyleth, dear.
Marisha: Yes?
Laura: I know it was never made official, but I'm assuming you two would've spent your life together. As much of it as he had, anyway.
Marisha: He taught me how to love and I have a hard time with interpersonal relationships.
Laura: I would've never known.
Marisha: So I would've held onto that one for as long as I could've. And I still will.
Laura: I still count you as my sister.
Marisha: As I count you as mine. Going to have to look out for each other now.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: I'm going to quietly wander outside.
Matt: You're on the platform outside.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm going to break off for a second.
Marisha: Also, fuck that raven bitch.
Laura: She's terrible.
Marisha: What the fuck?
Laura: You know we have a temple to her in Whitestone. I mean, here's the thing though. I feel like I want to destroy it because I hate her so much, but at the same time, I feel like we should leave it because maybe we can talk to him through it. We'll try it.
Travis: Pike.
Ashley: Yeah?
Travis: While we're here, I feel like if Bahamut is the natural enemy of Tiamat, I don't know if I want to be bound to this sword for much longer. I feel like my time of hunting Vecna is done. I feel like we have Arkhan's hand. Maybe if we handed it over to the Platinum-- these people?
Ashley: Okay. Yeah.
Travis: Then somebody else could take up that hunt, right?
Ashley: If that's what you want, Grog. I don't think that's a bad idea.
Travis: Yeah. Okay. I think I want to turn over this sword, but would you stay with me?
Ashley: Of course I will.
Travis: He's very persuasive. Actually, Scanlan, will you come with me also?
Sam: Absolutely.
Travis: All right. Can I make my way back towards somebody official-looking?
Matt: That would be either Highbearer Vord or the one you met earlier.
Travis: Highbearer Orb sounds good.
Matt: As you step back into the Platinum Sanctuary, the voice creeps in your head. "I know not what you're thinking, but know: together we are more powerful than anyone who's wielded me. We could take him down. We could destroy it all. You cannot, you will not discard me."
Travis: Anyone ever? Stronger than anyone that's ever wielded you?
Matt: "Anyone who's ever wielded me. Together, we could bring down anything that bears his title. Anyone who pursues his power."
Ashley: Grog?
Travis: Yeah?
Ashley: What's he saying?
Travis: (sighs) You make a really good point. We're really strong together and unstoppable.
Matt: You feel this (pulse) in your brain, there's a flash vision of the hand, once held in your grasp, swollen atop the actual body of Vecna in the battle. Your vision comes back and that urge in your belly creeps up.
Travis: I mean, hold on, Pike. Maybe we could do a lot of good. We could really rid the world of a lot of bad stuff.
Ashley: Listen, we did that before you knew this sword. We're all strong together. You were strong before it and you'll be strong after it.
Travis: (exhales) Okay. (strained) Highbearer Orb, a moment, please.
Matt: As you enter the chamber once more, the Highbearer turns around. "Yes, Grog Strongjaw, what do you require?"
Travis: I would like to make a deposit.
Matt: "Go on."
Travis: I have on my person the Sword--
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw.
Travis: Okay. 14.
Matt: The words don't escape your mouth and you realize this was a bad idea.
Travis: (sighs) I'm so sorry to waste your time. I wanted to thank you for hosting us. Bidet. And I start to turn and walk out.
Ashley: I grab him by the hand. So he can't go anywhere.
Sam: Are you not doing this, Grog?
Travis: It's a bad idea.
Matt: "We could do so much together. We can destroy anyone who's ever thought to pray to the now Undying King sealed away. We could wipe his presence from this planet!"
Travis: (strained) Together we could do so much, we could dry eraser-board the planet.
Sam: Whatever your wishes are, Grog. I'll go along with it. If you wish to keep the sword, that's fine with me.
Travis: I want to keep it.
Sam: Great.
Ashley: Scanlan, I don't think this is a good idea.
Sam: Okay. Sell me on this.
Ashley: Look at him!
Sam: He's just flexing his face muscles.
Ashley: He's getting all weird.
Travis: (strained) I want to keep it!
Sam: No, he does this when he needs to go poo. I've seen him do it.
Ashley: I know. He definitely does this when he needs to go poo. But this is so much worse!
Sam: I mean, it's been a hard day. I think we all need a really good bowel movement.
Travis: I start walking out of the Sanctuary.
Matt: Pike, make a strength check.
Ashley: No. Yes.
Matt: So roll and add your strength modifier, which I think is four.
Ashley: It's five.
Matt: Oh, it's five.
Laura: She's got the gauntlets on.
Matt: Gauntlets bring it to 19, so it'll be a plus four, I'm pretty sure.
Ashley: Wait, I think I had a plus one somewhere.
Sam: Did you get some boon or boost or something?
Ashley: With a plus four, it's 17.
Matt: 17. Grog, roll a strength check.
Laura: Roll a one! Roll a one!
Travis: 19.
Matt: 19. Pike, your feet begin to scrape against the marble as Grog's form and strength, which is just a little bit more than you. He's a little more monster than your monster right now.
Ashley: Can I swing my other hand up and try to pull more?
Matt: I'll allow you one more strength check with disadvantage.
Sam: Really conflicted here.
Travis: (strained) I want to help the planet.
Sam: He seems totally normal to me.
Ashley: 14.
Matt: Grog, roll another strength check.
Travis: 15.
Matt: Still, your metal boots are scraping across the marble as you're pulling and trying to hold him back as he's walking out the room. The voice says, "Yes. Together, the two of us."
Travis: (strained) Just the two of us. We can make it if we try! Just the two of us, Kas and I.
Matt: Highbearer Vord says, "Is everything all right?"
Sam: Pike, do you want me to try to stop him? What's going on?
Ashley: I think this is not a good idea. Grog, this is something you wanted to do. You need to fight it.
Travis: Can I try and fight it?
Matt: You already lost at the moment. So yeah, he's currently locked into that mindset.
Sam: Pike, should I do something or no?
Ashley: Well, I think we could both do something, but I want Grog to fight this.
Sam: Why don't I help him fight it? I will cast Suggestion on Grog, using my last level two spell. And suggest that he think long and hard about maybe fighting back against this sword. One more time.
Ashley: Then if it doesn't work, I have an idea.
Matt: All right. So bringing up Suggestion here, make a wisdom saving throw, Grog.
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. Okay. As the suggestion creeps through your mind, the familiar voice of Scanlan through your ears gives you just enough moment of pause to allow you an additional saving throw against the influence.
Travis: Maybe I'll take mine-- is it a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: Yes, it is.
Travis: That's a five.
Taliesin: My god, we're saved.
Matt: The suggestion does not seem to take hold and he's now dragged Pike almost back to the entryway of the Platinum Sanctuary and the Highbearer is still looking a bit confused.
Sam: He's made his choice.
Ashley: No! Grog. Stop just one moment.
Travis: Okay. I stop.
Ashley: And I look him in the eyes, I cast Greater Restoration. Still have another slot left, will that work?
Matt: I would like you to go ahead and make a wisdom check. This is contested against the wisdom of the sword.
Ashley: I'm casting it at 7th-level because that's all I have left.
Matt: You know what, it's not going to have much of an effect on this really, unfortunately. But the spell's cast. So roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: You're smarter than a sword!
Ashley: Do I get an advantage?
Matt: Unfortunately, no in the circumstance. Just roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier, which I believe is a five?
Ashley: I have. Yeah, it's five. So nine.
Marisha: Oh!
Sam: Oh!
Matt: Well, (laughs).
Ashley: You die.
Matt: Yeah, you actually die. No. That's not worth it. It's fine.
Sam: Vax comes back and kills you.
Matt: Yeah. I rolled a seven and he has a wisdom modifier of plus one.
Laura: Oh shit!
Marisha: Oh my god, you did it!
Matt: Like I legitimately-- that's pretty stupid.
Taliesin: Did you use my die?
Matt: No, I did not use your die. I used my purple one. I'm saving yours for the next campaign. So as the strength of wills between the cleric and the sword begin to combat, the warmth of Pike's friendship and the force of Sarenrae's guidance washes through your body and the cold steel of the sword begins to warm to the touch. And for a brief minute, it gets so warm it's hot. It burns your fingertips and you instinctively throw the blade to the ground. It clatters and slides about 15 feet from you, spiralling and sparking across the marble floor. The Highbearer's foot catches it in place. He leans forward. "Now I'm certainly curious."
Travis: (deep breath) It is the Sword of Kas.
Matt: You watch as the color begins to somewhat return to Grog's face, his eyes returning to their natural pigment. The sallow, sunken features of his body begin to fill out once more, the influence of the blade having left his psyche and physicality.
Ashley: Oh. You're back to light gray again. You look great.
Travis: I'm feeling so achy. What happened? Whew!
Ashley: You made a decision and I felt it was the right thing to do.
Travis: Yeah. We kept the sword, right?
Ashley: Yeah, it's there.
Sam: They're holding it for you.
Travis: Oh. Okay.
Matt: At this point, you can see two of the other Scalebearer guardians have flanked the sides of the Highbearer. As he removes his foot from the blade and steps back, they both carefully lift it with a gauntlet and present it before him and he glances down. "So you say this blade aided you?"
Travis: Yes. That blade, careful with it, very powerful. He is bent on the destruction of one thing and one thing only. Vecna.
Matt: "Good to know. We'll keep this within our vaults in case the day or time arises."
Travis: Wait! I have something else. Then I show the hand of Arkhan.
Matt: "Yes?" It flops limply in your grasp.
Travis: Oh! The person that owned this hand-- okay, stay with me. Chopped this off and took Vecna's hand and stuck it on and then this got left over. So this is not his hand anymore and the one that he does have is Vecna's. So if you use your noodle, you can use this to trace him.
Matt: "There are limitations to the use of such objects. It may be of some aid to us, but the knowledge of this individual is far more important. However, we will accept this thing." And he ushers his hand forward and another servant comes forward and retrieves the hand from you and folds the fingers up and places it within a small pillow. Backs away.
Ashley: I think that was a great idea.
Travis: Yeah, right? It was pretty smart.
Ashley: Yes, it was very smart.
Matt: "What was the name of this? This current wielder of the Hand of Vecna."
Travis: Arkin. Arkeen?
Sam: Arkhan.
Travis: Arkhan. Arkhan the Fool. The Cruel. The--
Sam: Misguided.
Matt: "Arkhan the Misguided?"
Travis: Don't underestimate him. He's really buff and devious.
Sam: And he's got another hand that he could chop off too. One in reserve.
Matt: "Very well. So we'll begin to do research and seek out this Arkhan the Cruel?"
Travis: Cool. Yeah, he was pretty cool. He was pretty cool.
Sam: I was fighting a god. I didn't really catch his name.
Travis: Well see, don't hurt him. He actually helped us defeat Vecna. He pulled a tricksy-doodle and took the hand.
Matt: "I would do whatever it takes to not trust individuals who would steal such an artifact with their own means."
Travis: Sure.
Matt: "We'll find this individual. Rest assured. The will of Bahamut turned on him now, I doubt he'll find a place to hide. Thank you very much."
Travis: Yep. Beep beep. All right, Pike, shall we away?
Ashley: We shall away.
Travis: Scanlan, shall we away?
Sam: Away we shall.
Travis: Away we-- oui oui?
Ashley: Oui oui!
Sam: Oui oui!
Sam: Bidet.
Travis: Bidet.
Ashley: Bidet.
Matt: "Bidet." As you exit the Sanctuary, you meet up with the rest of your friends that are still taking their quiet moments of reflection on the exterior platform on the outside of the Sanctuary overlooking the eastern side of Vasselheim.
Ashley: How do you feel?
Travis: I feel good. I feel like pursuing Vecna was something that we all did together and I feel like whatever we do now is new and I felt like I was going to have to do that on my own and I don't want to do that.
Laura: Grog, you wouldn't have to do anything on your own.
Travis: That's good to know.
Laura: Yeah. We're in this together.
Sam: I've got a thing, actually, I've got to get to.
Laura: Can I walk over to Percy? Are you still over by yourself?
Taliesin: Well, yeah. I'll take care of something. I'm sitting in a corner and I'm staring into the reflection of my sword. And I'm gently tapping the contract in my pocket. And I'm going to say, Ipkesh.
Laura: No. I'm going to sit down next to you.
Taliesin: You're too late. You've been doing a thing. Could you bring him back? Would it, the thing that you gave me, bring him back?
Matt: There's no answer.
Taliesin: Hmm. Nothing at all. All right.
Laura: Now I'm going to sit down next to you. How are you?
Taliesin: I have no idea. I think I really miss my family. I think I miss my sisters and my parents. I think I was going to be a clockmaker once. I haven't thought about that. There was a moment. Do you remember when we met?
Laura: I do.
Taliesin: I, for a brief time, thought that I had died within that prison and I was having a fever dream from starvation and this was what that felt like, was my mind making stories of friends and adventures and these things I would never do because I was a coward and fool. I miss my family so much and I've done some terrible things. I gave Grog that sword.
Laura: You did.
Taliesin: It didn't feel real.
Laura: Now it does.
Taliesin: I don't know. This is new. I'm sorry.
Laura: What were you going to do? Are you going to fight the Raven Queen for me?
Taliesin: Many years ago, I went to make a deal with her and she told me that I was broken and that I had always been broken. Part of me was going to save your brother and really, I just wanted to prove it to her. I wanted to hurt her for hurting me.
Laura: I think we're all broken, Percy.
Taliesin: I am so tired of hurting people.
Laura: You don't have to hurt anyone anymore.
Taliesin: I love you very much.
Laura: I love you.
Taliesin: This has been a terrible day.
Laura: It's horrible!
Taliesin: Where's Kiki? Where's Scanlan? I think I owe him an apology. Oh god, I owe Grog an apology. Maybe I'll not apologize to Grog. That sounds like a really terrible idea.
Laura: Darling.
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: You're a good person and you're not broken anymore. All right? We'll filling each other's gaps. We'll be the glue.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: And don't do anything crazy anymore. No deals with Raven Queens, all right? Let's not fight any more gods.
Taliesin: I was going to say let's destroy the one in Whitestone. Maybe we could seal it up, leave it because you know, but--
Laura: I want to see if I can talk to him through it. Is that stupid?
Taliesin: How would I know? Seems worth a shot. I'm too tired to be angry.
Laura: We did a thing today. A pretty big thing.
Taliesin: Was that today? It legitimately feels like a week ago at this point. (laughter)
Taliesin: It's been a long day. Yeah, we'll rejoin. Sorry about Manners. That was rude.
Sam: Are you apologizing for something?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: That's stupid.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: I never said sorry for leaving!
Taliesin: Yeah, but you're you. You don't have to apologize, we just assume.
Sam: Well, I'm sorry. Sorry I left.
Taliesin: I will not accept it so that when you come to your senses later, you don't feel like you've compromised. But thank you. (laughter)
Sam: That's fair.
Travis: You handing out apologies?
Taliesin: No. Yes. Sorry about the skull.
Marisha: Oh. I'm pretty sure you just handed out an apology after you just said you weren't going to hand out an apology.
Taliesin: I'm a human. I'm made of contradictions. You people wouldn't understand.
Marisha: I think Percy is a walking contradiction.
Travis: I will consider accepting your apology if you tell me whatever happened to it.
Taliesin: (sighs) Oh my god. I legitimately don't remember.
Marisha: I thought-- wait, we--
Matt: At that point, two hands drape around the side of Grog's shoulder up top and Vex as the long golden braids down the arms of Allura Vysoren says, "My friend Grog, best not to worry about it. Wherever it is, it's beyond our grasp now."
Travis: Okay, Allura. (laughter)
Marisha: Did you just sitcom mug? "Okay, Allura!" (laughter)
Matt: If we could've freeze-framed and rolled credits on that to end the campaign, I would have been happy. (laughs) Allura takes her hands back, then reaches over and musses up the side of Pike's hair. (sighs) "We've been through quite a bit together, haven't we?"
Laura: So much.
Matt: "Lot of ups and downs."
Marisha: You were quite an inspiration, Allura. I hope you know. You inspired me quite a lot.
Matt: "I'm only doing what everybody else is doing in this world: make it up as you go along."
Marisha: We know a lot about that. Allura, is Vasselheim going to be looking for members to join the council?
Matt: "Vasselheim? What do you mean? Vasselheim is mostly a religious council, if you know."
Marisha: Totally.
Matt: "I could put in a word, but I didn't consider this really your type of--"
Marisha: No, right.
Matt: "Here?"
Sam: She's asking for somebody else, I'm pretty sure she wasn't asking for her.
Marisha: I actually was, actually.
Matt: "Oh. I can inquire."
Marisha: I was thinking Pike, but I don't know--
Matt: "If I do recall, you have a temple here. One that you pretty much built."
Taliesin: How is that temple right now?
Matt: "That's a very good question. Pike? Would you like to go see your temple?"
Ashley: I would like to go see my temple.
Matt: "Very well." She waves her fingers a bit and casts Fly on all of you.
Laura: Oh shit, on everybody?!
Matt: On a high enough level, you can.
Ashley: Whoa.
Travis: Pike! Go upside down! (wookiee growl)
Laura: That was the best wookiee noise you've ever made, babe!
Taliesin: That was a really good wookiee noise.
Travis: (mediocre wookiee growl)
Matt: Retracted immediately. As she was here helping defend, she didn't waste her 8th-level slot, she is able to get you guys all flying for the moment and you all coast. As she finishes casting the spell, you could see some of the nearby wardens of the Platinum Sanctuary go, "Um--" "I know it's arcane, shut up. It's fine." You all take off the steps and begin to glide down over to the city, and there you can already see people are coming out of their homes. Exactly. So eventually, you find your way north to the Quadroads, towards the base of the Heaven Stair Mountain, where the temple resides. The temple looks like it's sustained a little bit of damage. It looks like a portion of the upper floor of the three-tier tower-- Colosseum-esque, but it does taper a bit towards the top. The top part has partially fallen in and it looks like it's seen wear and tear, but it doesn't look like it's been destroyed or anything. As you come up to the temple, you can already see there are refugees of homes that were destroyed from the incursion of the Braving Grounds that are being gathered in and the temple's filled with people. On the outside, you see Gesyra, the older woman who helped you found the temple and build it. As she approaches, she's now one of the Priests of Rebirth and has been working with you for some time and turns and sees your face. You can see her graying hair, which is bunned up very tightly in the back. She has her spectacles and she has the long robes of blue and gold. She sees you. "My Pike!" She rushes up and gives you a hug. She's much bigger than you, being a human, but her posture puts her almost on your level. "I'm so glad you're safe."
Ashley: It's so wonderful to see your face.
Matt: "We've housed who we can. We're a bit at capacity at the moment."
Ashley: Okay. Well, it looks a bit better than I thought it would.
Matt: "We did our best to defend. Is it done?"
Ashley: It's done.
Matt: You see her eyes crack at that moment and tears begin to flow. She smiles. "I knew you could do it."
Ashley: Well, we all did.
Matt: She looks around at the rest of you, pats you on the head for a minute and pulls away and goes, "You get to wear the greatest outfits, don't you?"
Ashley: (giggles)
Matt: "Well, anything you need, food, we have room for a few more."
Sam: I would suggest that we-- there's bars here, right? In Vasselheim? They drink, don't they?
Matt: Oh, yeah. There's bars here.
Marisha: Maybe they do a dry city after a certain time.
Matt: Are you kidding me? Religion and alcohol go together perfectly. That's a time-honored tradition!
Sam: Why don't we go find a tavern somewhere and let these people pick up the pieces, and give them their space?
Marisha: Do you need any type of water, or anything we can immediately assist you with?
Matt: "Clean water would be wonderful."
Marisha: Do you have somewhere to put it?
Matt: "Just a moment!" And she goes inside for a moment and calls out, four of the other lower acolytes of Sarenrae's temple, and they all have various buckets and reservoirs--
Marisha: I burn as many Create Water spells as it takes to fill them up.
Matt: They bring you inside, where there's the large statue of Sarenrae, where you had your first vision that called you to come find her. And there is a fountain as part of that and a reservoir in the bottom that has currently been mostly emptied to facilitate everyone here who needed water or to clean wounds. You help fill that and you very, very quickly manage to get the temple back to an easily sustainable level.
Taliesin: Pike?
Ashley: Yes?
Taliesin: I could use your assistance. I don't think I should have this, and I need this to be taken away from me before I do something foolish. And I hand Pike my contract.
Ashley: (sighs) I take it. Percy, what is this?
Taliesin: This, I thought, was proof that I was in control of myself. But it's just a terrible thing waiting to happen.
Sam: Ashley, I just texted you the contract.
Taliesin: Thank you. How do you have it on autosave?! Do you just have it?
Sam: Yeah.
Ashley: I mean, I somewhat know what it is.
Taliesin: I don't think it can be destroyed. But maybe it can be put far away.
Ashley: I will keep this, at the very least, very far from you.
Taliesin: I have every faith in you. Thank you. I think I'm done with that.
Sam: Pike, I have a porno book that I really think I shouldn't have anymore. Can I give it to you to take it away--
Taliesin: I'll take it away!
Sam: Oh, you'll take it? Okay.
Travis: I would like to bid on it, as well. Yeah, I have some money still--
Sam: It's not great.
Taliesin: Can you text it to us actually?
Ashley: Could you text me the book?
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: That's a three jpeg, man. Sorry.
Matt: So you guys go off to find a tavern and drink together?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah. We need to go have some toasts to Vax.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Laura: You said Allura took Velora?
Matt: Yeah. Well, at this point, she's probably still carrying her with you.
Laura: Oh, okay. I thought you said Allura took her away. Okay.
Matt: Yeah, because Allura took her off of you-- You know what? No, she's probably being tended to at the Platinum Sanctuary at the moment, seeing to her wounds.
Laura: Did I just leave her? I feel weird just leaving her.
Marisha: She'll be fine. She'll be safe.
Travis: She's in some pretty solid hands.
Laura: I'll run back and talk to her.
Matt: Okay. So you head back into the Sanctuary and retrieve her.
Laura: I'm going to make sure her wounds were tended because she was pretty busted up.
Matt: She was. Thankfully, there are a number of clerics and healers available that can take a moment away from the wounded of the battle to deal with a little girl. And when you come to her, she's still a bit battered and bruised. But she's all right.
Laura: Is there anyone who can send me to Syngorn?
Taliesin: Why doesn't she stay with us for a while?
Matt: You're asking this of anybody at the temple?
Laura: Do you think we should--
Sam: We can take a day.
Taliesin: I think maybe a little time spent in our company, as opposed to your father's company, would not be the worst idea.
Laura: Maybe a message of Sending. Can anyone do that? Pike? Do you have the message of Sending?
Sam: To whom?
Laura: To my father.
Marisha: To let him know that his daughter is still alive.
Ashley: I don't have it with me, but I--
Laura: Okay. Allura, you've done it before.
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: Could you send something to my father?
Matt: "I could. I could also bring her there, if you'd like."
Laura: No. Velora, would you want to go home right now?
Matt: Right now she's holding onto your neck a bit. She looks at you. "I miss you."
Laura: I miss you too.
Matt: "Can I stay a bit longer?"
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "Okay."
Taliesin: I think that's a great idea.
Laura: I think so too. Allura, will you say that Velora is safe, and that I'll be paying a visit very soon to return her?
Matt: "I believe that," and for a moment she looks just beyond your eyes, squints, "he's aware."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: "So to drinks?"
Laura: To drinks.
Taliesin: To drinks.
Matt: "I don't really drink. But after a day like today, I think I need one."
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Apple juice for you, little one!
Matt: She giggles in your ear. All right.
Laura: I'm bringing my sister to a bar.
Sam: Your nearly dead sister.
Marisha: Yeah. She's going to have to be introduced at some point.
Matt: Yeah. Allura takes a moment and squints her eyes for a second, apparently Sending another message, and then nodding. She leads you guys towards the Quadroads, and finds a pub called The Quarry's End. And it's not too far from Sarenrae's temple, which is why she chose it, and it looks to be like it was near a quarry that was built into the mountain that either dried up or was closed down for some reason, and then a tavern was opened instead as a means of still making money. It's super dive-y, it smells of stained wood and spilled wine. It's musty and perfect. And as you all come in, it's mostly empty, as people are still in the process of trying to figure things out. The few that are in there appear to be wounded soldiers that, as opposed to getting medical help, are in the process of drinking themselves into a numb state. But you find a table, you sit down, one of the barmaids comes up to you, goes: "Drinking away the fray, are you?"
Taliesin: I put, like, 20 gold on the table.
Matt: "Oh!"
Taliesin: We will take the cheapest, worst beer you have, and a round for everyone in the bar.
Matt: "But of course, sir! My pleasure!" Takes the coin.
Taliesin: If everyone's all right with that.
Laura: Of course, dear.
Travis: Can I also start pulling out the remaining eight expensive-ass bottles of wine from the bag of holding?
Marisha: Hell yeah! Drunk as shit! Now's the time!
Matt: Within moments, your table is covered in terrible beer and really expensive wine!
Travis: Expensive-ass!
Laura: That's what you wrote down, too.
Travis: Expensive-ass bottles of wine.
Matt: You pull two tables together and you guys are in the process-- You're a fair bit into your cups, and then the somewhat ajar door on the exterior slams open as the light filters in from the outside, and there you see standing the general half-height of an armored halfling, partially bloodied, armor dented as shit.
Travis: Kima!
Marisha: Kima!
Matt: Kima, as she walks in, sauntering in, with her blade being sheathed in the back of her giant scabbard, her Holy Avenger. "Got your message, honey! Not going to pass up a drink after a day like this!" (cracking) "Ow, ow, ow!" She comes and sits down next to Allura and puts her arm around her real fast. "This is new!" and points to the drink in front of Allura.
Taliesin: It's a special occasion.
Marisha: We're bad influences.
Travis: Yeah. Desperate times and all that.
Matt: "Good. I guess that's why we're friends."
Marisha: I see you're working the late shift.
Matt: "Well, you know. When there's streets crawling with skeletons, I got to be there."
Taliesin: Been having a good time, then?
Matt: "Oh, it's been amazing! It's been terrible! Terrible. But amazing!"
Marisha: Well, we frontloaded our hours.
Laura: Can we have another cup?
Matt: "Yeah!" The barmaid comes by, gets another cup, and leaves you guys all to drink and swap stories.
Taliesin: That thing that I was bugging you about?
Marisha: Which one? You bug me about a lot of things.
Taliesin: Well, that's fair. Now that I have a bit of alcohol in me.
Marisha: Yeah, and you ask me after I have a bit of alcohol in me. And I scry on Cassandra.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Oh god, he flipped a page. I hate that.
Matt: You take a long, deep sip of your drink and then close your eyes as you complete the scrying ritual you've half-scrawled on the dark wood wall on the side of the tavern. Your vision goes cloudy, and you feel yourself being transitioned rapidly through wind and cloud as the temperature of your atmosphere begins to drop, and there, you begin to break cloud cover to look down upon Whitestone. Your vision jumps once more to the exterior of the castle, jumps once more, and there you see, lying in bed, covers pulled up to her chest, with at least three different servants and one medical personnel there at her side, bag open, tending to her wounds. She's asleep, but she's breathing.
Marisha: Looks like she's been tended to like a proper de Rolo.
Laura: Did you see Kaylie and Gilmore?
Marisha: Did I see Kaylie and Gilmore?
Matt: Not in the room, no.
Taliesin: She made it back to Whitestone. One would assume that's how she got there.
Marisha: She was not doing well. Gilmore was the most able-bodied. I'm assuming he got her there. I hope.
Taliesin: I'm sure. I have faith.
Marisha: I'll scry on the rest of them tomorrow.
Taliesin: I'm drunk. Don't get used to it.
Marisha: Faithless until the end.
Taliesin: Faithless until the end.
Marisha: Thank you, Percy.
Taliesin: Thank you, Keyleth.
Marisha: You taught me just the right amount of how to be a shithead. Just enough.
Sam: We should toast to Vax'ildan, our fallen member.
Matt: At which point, Kima goes, "Yeah, where is that asshole, anyway?"
Sam: He's really stealthy.
Matt: "Ain't that the truth. All right." She grabs her cup.
Laura: Apple juice.
Matt: She's holding a cup.
Sam: What do you have, Ashley?
Ashley: I have a cup, and it's a vintage cup. I don't need to talk about this. (laughter)
Matt: Glasses raised, and at this point as the glasses are raised, you can hear whispers off to the side. You glance over, and you can see one of the nearby tables, which is filled with four Bastions who had been drinking to the battle and have now taken notice and seemingly recognized who's at the table across the way. They're all staring, and they all grab their glasses and raise them, too.
Laura: To Vax'ildan. He was the best of us.
Marisha: The most selfless.
Sam: The most frequently naked.
Marisha: Second to you.
Travis: The most frustrating.
Taliesin: The brightest and the darkest.
Sam: That's true. To Vax.
All: To Vax.
Matt: "So. What comes next?"
Travis: What does come next?
Marisha: (sighs) It's hard to think after a day that feels like a week, like today.
Laura: Syngorn and Whitestone, I would assume.
Taliesin: Home for a bit, at least. And of course, everybody is welcome, always.
Marisha: I've got to get back to Zephrah.
Sam: Do we have to check on Greyskull Keep?
Laura: In Emon?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: Someone should stay there.
Travis: We left it as an outpost. I wouldn't mind going back to Whitestone for a bit.
Taliesin: I'll also say, for those of you, especially. Grog, you have your freedoms, and if you wanted to become lord of Greystone and have a place of your own that you could invite us to, as opposed to wandering.
Marisha: Greyskull?
Taliesin: Greyskull.
Travis: (hesitant noises)
Laura: Or you could just hang in Whitestone.
Travis: I'll think about it. It seems like that has responsibilities.
Laura: The Grand Poobah has a lot of responsibilities, too.
Travis: I do. There is an updated tour.
Sam: We'll go to Whitestone and figure it out. That's where Kaylie is, right? We assume.
Laura: Potentially.
Marisha: I don't think I can go back to Whitestone with you.
Laura: Why?
Sam: Oh, why? You've got to go back to your people?
Marisha: I have to go back to Zephrah.
Taliesin: Well, I think we're going to need help getting to Whitestone, and then I think it's going to take at least a day for you to regain the power to return to your people.
Marisha: Bad influences, all of you. Assholes.
Taliesin: We're not getting rid of you quite that easily.
Marisha: All right. One day.
Travis: If you can bear it.
Marisha: And then I want to not see your faces for a bit.
Sam: Sure, that makes sense. Pikey-poo, where are you going?
Ashley: Well, I'd like to come with you guys for a little bit because frankly, I don't really want to be alone for a while.
Taliesin: I don't think any of us do.
Travis: I pull her into the biggest hug.
Ashley: Oh, P-- oh, Grog.
Travis: You almost called me your own name. It's okay. You'll be fine.
Ashley: I was going to call you Poobah, but then I wanted to say your real name.
Marisha: We could go back to Whitestone whenever. I've still got a little bit of juice left.
Laura: You've got enough juice to get us to Whitestone right now?
Marisha: I do, believe it or fucking not.
Travis: I don't. You gave us the option.
Marisha: What?
Travis: You said believe it or fucking not. I call nope.
Marisha: Oh, it was more of a rhetorical-- it's like a trick or treat-- why do we still try to explain things to him? I haven't learned.
Ashley: Because he's learning.
Matt: Kima's clasping her cup and goes, "I can watch this all day."
Travis: Thank you, Pike.
Ashley: He learns something new every day.
Taliesin: How did Whitestone look?
Matt: It's blurred at a distance. Aside from the specific target of your scrying, you don't get much of a vision, just an idea of the blurry exterior.
Laura: Should we drunkenly walk to the tree?
Sam: Are we transporting tonight? Why don't we chill for a night?
Laura: Don't you want to see your daughter?
Sam: Well, of course, but I'm drunk and bloody.
Marisha: We can drunkenly walk there and take our time and enjoy the stars and we can-- oh! Scanlan--
Sam: Did you have a drink?
Marisha: Scanlan.
Sam: What can we do?
Marisha: We can do little arcane cantrips when no one's looking and break the rules a little bit. Of Vasselheim. Just cantrips, though.
Sam: You're such a rebel.
Marisha: I know.
Taliesin: I forgot.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: No, you're fine.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: Nothing. You're fine. Love you very much.
Marisha: I've lost the love of my life today. I'm allowed to be belligerent.
Taliesin: You are.
Travis: Are we throwing caution to the wind?
Sam: Sure.
Travis: I do have something that might up the party a little bit.
Sam: Okay, what is it?
Travis: I reach into the bag of holding and I pull out a little leather pouch.
Marisha: Do you have that sandkheg shit?
Laura: No.
Travis: What?
Sam: What is that? What have you got?
Travis: So I've got this little deck of cards and every time someone pulls from it, great shit happens.
Ashley: I'm in.
Travis: One. Two. Scanlan?
Sam: I've seen this before, haven't I? I think I was with you when you got the guy rich. Wasn't I?
Matt: No, he was on his own.
Travis: He's the Lord of the Quadroads now.
Sam: I was with him when he did one of them, though.
Matt: You're semi-aware that there's something going on. Make an arcana check.
Taliesin: Oh, this could go so badly.
Sam: 15.
Matt: 15. Something creeping in the back of your mind, something you've learned, something you've heard, really tells you that this is powerful and chaotic.
Sam: I'll watch for now.
Travis: You'll partake.
Sam: Probably.
Travis: Three. Percy?
Taliesin: I think I've had enough for one day.
Sam: If we're going to do that, we should go back to Whitestone first.
Travis: Why? This place is already fucked up. Let's get it on. Keyleth?
Marisha: I am drunk enough to where I'm not going to stop it or argue against it, but I won't partake, so that's pretty good for me.
Travis: Why are you so resistant to gifts and wonder? Magic?
Marisha: Grog, you've had two weapons speak to you--
Travis: Don't be jelly.
Laura: Nothing powerful comes without a price. We saw that. We just saw that with the Raven Queen. Power comes at a price. You think that wonderful things are going to be pulled out of your hands here, and there's going to be no consequences?
Travis: Pretty much.
Marisha: Grog, haven't we been through enough shit to know nothing's free?
Travis: What?
Marisha: Fuck it.
Travis: Here or Whitestone?
Taliesin: Oh, definitely not at Whitestone.
Travis: All right. Pike, you want one? (laughter)
Taliesin: I've always worried about the two of you.
Ashley: Well, I think you should pick a card, and we deal with one as of right now. And then maybe I'll pick one later.
Travis: Well, jeez, I thought we were all having tequila shots and going crazy and taking pictures and writing our name on the bathroom walls, but it seems like everybody's lost their nerve. I put it back in the bag of holding. (laughter and groaning)
Matt: You're such an asshole!
Taliesin: You're such a dick.
Laura: Don't do it!
Marisha: You insult our resolve and hold out on us all at the same time?
Travis: The night's still young.
Ashley: Ugh, just pick one!
Matt: All right.
Sam: We're traveling now? We're drunk!
Marisha: Yeah!
Taliesin: Let's drive a tree. It'll be fun.
Matt: You all wander outside of the tavern, find your way over to the nearest tree that's functional. It takes you a little bit, because a lot of trees look thicker at a distance when you're drunk than when you approach.
Marisha: Yeah, no, this one won't work. No, this won't work. Sorry.
Taliesin: That's more of a shrub.
Marisha: Sorry. Next one. That one looks good.
Taliesin: Yes, that looks nice.
Sam: That's a young boy.
Taliesin: Oh, yes.
Matt: Eventually, you find the tree that'll work, which is interesting, because you have this combination of people that are recognizing you as Vox Machina, as the whispered saviors of the town as you drunkenly stumble through the city streets, naught but hours after sealing a recently ascended god. It's strangely so perfect for you. As you approach the tree that you find that'll work, Allura has her arm over Kima. She's a lightweight. "You go on ahead. We need to help here with the construction effort."
Laura: You've got to get your construction on?
Matt: "No, we're just--" And then Kima goes, "Yes!"
Travis: (laughing) She doesn't handle that booze very well.
Matt: "We'll see you soon. Travel safe, and thank you."
Sam: Love you.
Matt: "Okay." (laughter)
Matt: Kima drags her hand. Kima's drank far more, but is sober. She can hold her liquor. "All right, thank you, guys!" And grabs her hand and pulls her off, and they both wave bye as they step back into the city. You complete your spell, emerging from the exterior of the Sun Tree. Back in Whitestone, the comfort is here once more. It seems to be just past dusk at this point.
Marisha: (slurred) See? When you travel-- wait, no. When you travel west to east, you gain time. See?
Sam: Yeah, you called it.
Ashley: Time travel.
Marisha: (slurred) Happy hour is right now in Whitestone. Just saying.
Taliesin: Let's head home?
Sam: That works.
Marisha: Okay. Heading home works.
Matt: You guys make your way to the castle. Food is presented. Everyone's happy to see you back. What do you want to do?
Sam: Now or forever?
Matt: Oh, we'll get to the forever bit in a minute.
Marisha: Cry myself to sleep?
Sam: I want to go see Kaylie, I guess, if she's around. Are we hanging out together, or are we breaking off?
Laura: (quietly) Go see your daughter.
Sam: All right. I'm going to go see Kaylie.
Matt: Okay. Asking around a bit, it doesn't take much to find Kaylie in your old room in Whitestone, the one where you both left when you first exited the group for a short time. She's in there, bandaged up, and looks like she's taking a dagger and throwing it into the wall, then walking over and pulling it back out, sitting back on the bed and throwing it, and it bounces off. The hilt hits. She's like, "Fuck." Picks it back up and doesn't notice you in the doorway. As she sits back down, she looks over.
Sam: Hi.
Matt: "Hi."
Sam: You with a dagger in your hand's always a little scary.
Matt: "Why, does it frighten you?"
Sam: Not any--
Matt: "Boo!"
Sam: (yelps) Okay, it frightens me a little.
Matt: She sheathes it on the side.
Sam: You okay?
Matt: "I've had better days. I'm all right."
Sam: Good.
Matt: "You're alive."
Sam: Surprisingly, yes. We won.
Matt: "I figured, if you're standing here before me. That's good. Congratulations."
Sam: Thanks. I'm sorry that I had to go do that. I had to.
Matt: "I'd be disappointed if you'd've came back with me. More important things."
Sam: So what now? Do you want to go back to Ank'Harel and keep criming?
Matt: You watch for a brief second her tough exterior break, and you can see her eyes welling up a little bit. She looks at the ground for a minute, then looks back up at you. "I'm glad you're safe."
Sam: I'm so happy I got to see you again. I thought for a second that when we said goodbye, it was the last time.
Matt: "I didn't. I know you too well, at this point. You're too much of a turd to die."
Sam: That's true. Only good people die.
Matt: "I'd like to go back to Ank'Harel. I don't know if this whole Meat Man thing's for me anymore."
Sam: Yeah. No, I hear you. I don't know if it's for me, either. It was fun.
Matt: "It was a lot of fun!"
Sam: It felt like we were killing time a little bit. There's something else that we should do. I don't know what. Maybe your thing won't be my thing.
Matt: "Let's find someone to pass on the mantle to, eh?"
Sam: That's a good idea.
Matt: "I think the Meat Man should be there, just not us."
Sam: Yeah, that's a great idea. We'll train a replacement.
Matt: "Still take a percentage. I mean, we worked this hard!"
Sam: Passive income, right? It's the dream.
Matt: "It's the meat and potatoes of any good business venture."
Sam: I should have thought of that. That's amazing.
Matt: "That's why the daughter's an upgrade. After that, I don't know. I hate to admit it, but--"
Sam: Did you finish school?
Matt: "No."
Sam: Do you want to?
Matt: "Yeah."
Sam: All right. Well, let's do that, then. You go to school.
Matt: "I'm not really made for a lyceum. We can go visit. I didn't expect you to recommend schooling!"
Sam: Listen, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, and I don't want you to make the same ones. I love you, and I want to support you in whatever you want to do, at this point. My time has come, and I've done my thing, and my thing is done, and now I want to help you do whatever it is that you want to do. If that means I can be close to you, then great, but if it doesn't, then I'll come visit every once in a while. We made quite a bit of money as the Meat Man.
Matt: "Aye, that we did."
Sam: And it's a good sum to get started.
Matt: "Would it be enough to pay for a right top-end education so I can gloat over all the other kids that are raised by the various lords and ladies of Emon? Become one of those privileged kids."
Sam: You can have the best education.
Matt: "That's what I want to do. I want to rub it in their face."
Sam: All right. Education for spite. I like that.
Matt: "That sounds like a Shorthalt endeavor."
Sam: Sure. Whatever you need.
Matt: She stands up from the bed and walks over and puts her hand on your shoulder in a pat, pat. She pulls you into a hug and rests her head on your shoulder and doesn't say anything.
Sam: You won't have to worry about me anymore.
Matt: "I'm going to worry about you every day."
Sam: Thank you. Thank you for coming into my life.
Matt: "Thank you for being enough of a shitbag to bring me into it."
Sam: I'm so happy. I made so many mistakes, but it turns out that some of them weren't mistakes, after all.
Matt: "I'm still young and unlearned. Time will tell." She pulls you a little tighter in.
Sam: I'll snuggle and fall asleep in the room at some point.
Matt: She smells the alcohol on your breath and (groans). "Go lie there. I'm going to--" (groans) She winces as her wound in her shoulder flares up. "I need some fresh air. You go to sleep." Exhaustion hits you, and you end up passing out at the foot of the bed.
Sam: I'm in my room now?
Matt: Yeah, your old room.
Laura: I'm going to tuck Velora into bed.
Matt: She's asleep by the time you get there. Travel and everything has tuckered her out. You tuck her in, put the blanket up.
Laura: I tiptoe out of the room, and I find Percy.
Taliesin: I'll be in Cassandra's room.
Laura: Percival?
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: Could I talk to you for a moment?
Taliesin: Of course.
Laura: I completely understand if you want to stay with Cassandra for the night. Would you mind not being very comfortable, though? I was thinking of camping in the woods.
Taliesin: I think that sounds lovely, and you're always better than comfortable. I had a thought, actually. My god, it is hard surviving, isn't it? Perhaps Keyleth could use a friend right now, and I know that you carry one with you.
Laura: Trinket?
Taliesin: Just for a bit. I think she could use a companion who's not going to apologize or give too much sympathy.
Laura: Of course. I send Trinket to Keyleth's room.
Matt: As Trinket ascends the stairs, he looks back over the shoulder. (questioning noise)
Laura: She might cry a lot on you. All right, dear?
Matt: Makes it up the stairs.
Laura: It's going to be a lot harder to stay warm out in the woods now.
Taliesin: We'll figure something out. I grew up here. I'm used to it.
Laura: I wanted to remember how I used to camp with Vax when we were kids.
Taliesin: I'd like to see that.
Laura: I guess we go out and set up a little fire.
Matt: You guys make your way into the woods and set up a camp for the evening's rest together. Keyleth, are you in your room? The door (creaks) and Trinket comes in and stares right at you. (slurps) And licks up the side of your face. Your hair sticks up for a minute.
Marisha: Oh, buddy!
Matt: (bear noises) He leans in and plops down on the ground, a giant beanbag mound of bear fur.
Marisha: I cover Trinket with snot and tears as I sob into his belly. First night alone, but with Trinket.
Taliesin: Best teddy bear ever.
Marisha: Aware of the gesture. I cry.
Matt: Eventually the exhaustion and the alcohol hits you, and you fall asleep, cuddled up in the warm embrace of a very fantastic, recently meteor-struck bear.
Marisha: Drool and eyeliner and dirt.
Matt: Voice of the Tempest.
Sam: You were wearing eyeliner to our fight?
Marisha: Remember, I charcoal war-painted?
Sam: That makes sense.
Travis: Has everybody gone off?
Matt: Pike actually would still be around.
Travis: I make my way sneakily outside.
Matt: Pike, what are you doing?
Ashley: There's a couple of things.
Taliesin: There's a lovely tea rose garden in the back.
Sam: She's letting Grog go first.
Travis: Oh, really?
Ashley: If you wanted to go somewhere, sneak away.
Travis: Oh, you know, I was just gonna, um.
Matt: Who wants to go first? Pike? Grog? Who's going first?
Ashley: Just for a little bit, for about an hour, I want to go-- not deep into the woods where Percy and Vex are, but somewhere that's pretty for about an hour, and I'll make my way back.
Matt: As you're out there on your own, contemplating quietly, ruminating on the day, a faint howl finds the air, and stepping from the shadows, you see a large gray wolf: Galdric, the wolf that once belonged to the previous champion of the Raven Queen, Purvan, who was given charge over the forests on the outside. Saunters up to you. He is a large wolf. You are a tiny gnome. He steps up, sits next to you. In this little break in the trees where you can see the moon breaking through some of the passing clouds over Whitestone. The night is so cold, you can see your breath in the dark air through the beams of moonlight that make it through the canopy. As the wolf looks down at you, his intense eyes making a full scan of what you are, there's a recognition to his expression. The wolf looks back up. (howls) And gives a long, baleful howl, seemingly in remembrance and acknowledging that one with a familiar path to his has found his way back to the realm of the Raven Queen, as well.
Ashley: You are a beautiful creature. This might be strange, but I give him a hug.
Matt: You hug Galdric. You're used to Trinket, who's pretty well manicured. Galdric, not so much. There are clusters of fur that are dirt-encrusted.
Travis: Shit in them.
Matt: Probably. He's not a full, ruined beast. He lives in the forest. Smells of earth, dust, and nature. Doesn't seem to react to your hug, but allows it.
Ashley: I sit next to him.
Matt: He seems to share the space with you for the time that you're in the forest. Not a strong connection, but an acknowledgement, mainly focusing on the moon before it passes through the canopy and is no longer visible.
Ashley: I came out here to build a little something, so I'm glad to have you out here for a little bit. Thank you for staying with me.
Matt: The one ear to the side perks open to listen to your statement, but the vision doesn't meet yours, still focused in space as it fades. You get the essence that the wolf acknowledges you.
Ashley: (sighs) I feel like Grog would be so happy right now to be around a wolf. I give him a scratch behind his ear.
Matt: He actually seems to enjoy it and gives into it. One of the giant hind legs of the wolf--
Ashley: Oh, that's a good boy. I give out a little howl.
Matt: He howls along with you. (howls)
Ashley: That was for my friend Vax.
Matt: The wolf gets up, circles you once, and makes his way into the darkness of the forest once more.
Ashley: Goodbye. After a bit, I head back.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Travis: I wander outside, where I'm by myself. Do I see anyone?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Like it matters. Oh! 17.
Matt: Glancing about, there are some of the Pale Guard around. Nobody that you would be looking for, necessarily. You seem to be open to do as you please.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: I pull a card.
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: I'm so proud of you.
Marisha: Wait, where are you?
Laura: Outside of the castle.
Marisha: In the middle of fucking Whitestone?
Matt: Oh my god, Grog.
Ashley: Wait, as I'm walking back, do I see him at all?
Matt: (chuckles) Out in front of the castle, out in the courtyard area?
Travis: Yeah. It's nighttime.
Matt: Make a perception check, Pike.
Sam: Make it good.
Taliesin: Roll a natural 20.
Ashley: I rolled a natural 20.
Marisha: Shut your mouth!
Travis: I rolled a bunch of hit dice from our short rest.
Matt: As you're quietly climbing up the walkway to the base of Castle Whitestone--
Ashley: He's out in the open.
Matt: Yeah. You do. You look up and see Grog pull a card from the deck.
Ashley: I stand and watch for a moment.
Sam: Oh, here's the deck.
Laura: Oh my god. It is really happening. I can't fucking believe--
Marisha: Travis, pull good! Oh, please don't bring pit fiends on our heads.
Travis: I might have.
Sam: Negative two to everything.
Matt: Hold on. Deck of Many Things. All right, so. Grog, what did you pull?
Ashley: Oh shit.
Matt: Void.
Taliesin: Oh no!
Marisha: That can't be good.
Matt: I'm sure it's fine.
Laura: That's the worst one you could get!
Sam: The crew's laughing. Something's bad. Something's very bad.
Travis: I'm pretty sure--
Laura: That is so bad!
Taliesin: Oh my god! (laughs)
Sam: Wait, Pike saw him.
Matt: Pike.
Sam: You get a reaction.
Marisha: Did our internet go? (screaming and groaning)
Matt: Of all moments.
Taliesin: (cackles) This is your doing!
Matt: While we're here, Grog, I'm going to read you the card. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A Wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.
Sam: Wait, read it again.
Travis: I'll tell you. My soul is drawn from my body. My body is incapacitated. It is placed within an object that the DM chooses. A Wish spell will tell you the location of the object, but will not reverse the action.
Sam: Can anything reverse it?
Matt: Finding it and retrieving the object and restoring the soul.
Marisha: You fucking dick. You're a fucking dick!
Laura: Well, the campaign goes on for another-- I can't believe you just fucking did that.
Sam: Wait, she rolled.
Laura: Ashley?
Sam: She rolled something. Oh, that was her 20 from before.
Matt: Looks like we may have her back. Hopefully, because this is going to be-- oh my god.
Marisha: It is bad!
Sam: Oh my god, Travis. Why would you do that?
Matt: Give me the card. Let this be a lesson to everybody out there.
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: You said you weren't going to bring the Deck of Many Things into the game, and then you did!
Matt: No regrets.
Taliesin: Hashtag no regrets.
Matt: No "regerts" at all.
Taliesin: Oh god, I can't even.
Laura: Is Ashley texting?
Taliesin: She's just yelling obscenities.
Sam: Her internet just died.
Marisha: (mispronouncing) Worst fucking timing! Internet has gone! Timing! Worst fucking timing!
Taliesin: It's just obscenities. That's all it is.
Matt: So Grog, as you draw the card from the deck, your vision goes tunneled, dark, to a pinpoint: a singular pinpoint of deep, ruby red. And that's all. Your consciousness falls into a catatonic state.
Sam: Does she get a reaction or anything?
Matt: No.
Marisha: She doesn't get shit? She just watches?
Matt: She sees it happen.
Sam: With her 20, she saw!
Matt: I know. She's aware.
Sam: She can't yell? She can't cast something?
Matt: No, because he pulled the card. It's not a big (grunts). It's a (flip).
Sam: All right.
Matt: All righty, so.
Marisha: I guess we'll add that to our to do list.
Taliesin: I'd like to think that in the next campaign, we're going to find you in a glass coffin like Sleeping fucking Beauty.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: My body's still there.
Sam: She rolled a 17.
Marisha: So Grog's body is still there--
Matt: He's catatonic until the soul's returned.
Marisha: Catatonic.
Matt: To be fair, you've sealed Vecna. At level 19 and 20, this is not going to be an earth-shattering experience.
Marisha: Sure, it's just an annoyance.
Matt: And for the sake of the epilogue evening you guys, all planning to return to your various lives to relax--
Travis: I'm there catatonic with an open deck of cards in my hand like this.
Liam: You dingus!
Marisha: Goddamn it!
Travis: Somebody's going to find me.
Sam: To Grog! He was the dumbest of us all. He was the dumb and the dumb.
Taliesin: May he rest in bed sores for all eternity.
Matt: You spend the next two weeks finding your way through the halls of Pandemonium.
Laura: I can't fucking believe that shit.
Marisha: Wait, we spend two weeks?
Sam: The halls of Pandemonium?
Matt: Yes, where his soul is currently encapsulated.
Sam: God, you asshole.
Marisha: In what?
Travis: What are the halls of Pandemonium?
Marisha: I should be mourning right now, and I'm hunting your stupid ass down!
Travis: I'm keeping you occupied. I really did this for you.
Matt: Pandemonium is a plane of madness  a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then only at a maximum distance of ten feet. Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment. So yeah, that's a fun time. It's a fun adventure you guys go on to retrieve Grog's soul.
Marisha: Great therapy lesson.
Travis: We'll one-shot it later. (laughter)
Marisha: A healing trip.
Sam: It's a good side quest for the future someday.
Matt: A good moment of, "Oh, we're not going to get a rest." Hopefully, we'll get Ashley back, but in the meantime, for the purposes of this, you come back two weeks after, extremely angry. Grog, as suddenly you're restored, and that tiny bead of light fades back, and you're not outside anymore. You're actually sitting in a reclined, cushioned couch or chair of some kind in Castle Whitestone, and all of your currently living friends are all around you, looking very angry.
Travis: Oh! It got me a chair.
Laura: You fucking idiot.
Travis: What?
Laura: I cannot believe you did that.
Travis: Did what?
Marisha: Keyleth backhands him with the hand that has the most rings on it, of power.
Travis: Do I lose any hit points?
Marisha: Probably not!
Travis: What? What happened?
Taliesin: You lost card privileges.
Sam: Yep. Hand them over.
Taliesin: Oh, we already took the whole deck.
Travis: Wait!
Sam: You may lose your belt for this, friend.
Laura: Yeah. You're lucky we didn't shave your beard. Yeah.
Travis: I fucked up.
Laura: You fucked up a lot.
Sam: Percy lost his arm rescuing you!
Travis: I'm sorry.
Taliesin: Are you?
Travis: No. (laughter)
Travis: All right. I just thought, it did fantastic things before! I don't know why it doesn't like me so much.
Taliesin: I don't think it was personal.
Travis: Are you sure?
Sam: You've learned a lesson that we had to pay for.
Travis: All right. Sorry, guys. Sorry, Pike.
Ashley: Hello? (laughter)
Matt: Look at that timing. I don't even know, man.
Sam: Pike, can you hear us?
Ashley: My internet crashed at the worst fucking time.
Marisha: We can't even see you right now. You're a silhouette on the screen, but we can hear you.
Matt: Pike, do you know what happened?
Sam: Yeah, I texted her the gist of what happened.
Ashley: Okay, so you disappeared?
Matt: Grog's soul was trapped somewhere on the plane of Pandemonium, and you guys had to take two weeks and battle your way through a terrible plane filled with wind and madness and creatures that were banished there to never escape, eventually battling some terrible beast that was guarding the gem that contained his soul, returned, and he just now woke up on the couch after restoring his consciousness to his body, and has been slapped in the face by Keyleth and told that he lost card privileges.
Travis: (tearfully) And Percy lost his arm!
Ashley: Oh no. Wait, what?!
Sam: Well, I may have been fibbing about that part.
Marisha: It might be a cheap joke.
Taliesin: I might have lost my arm or I might be hiding it behind my back. I'm not sure.
Travis: So news flash, pro tip  the cards may be dangerous.
Taliesin: That's good to know.
Ashley: Okay. Maybe we leave it alone, then.
Laura: Hey! Hi! Oh my god, that was craziness.
Sam: Nice. Any other things that we need to wrap up for the evening?
Taliesin: I pull a card from the deck.
Sam: No! I invoke the third contract.
Matt: I'll draw the card for you. Whichever one smashes Whitestone.
Taliesin: Suddenly, I lose everything.
Matt: Exactly. Oh my god, if you pull that card?
Taliesin: Wouldn't that be amazing?
Matt: Don't you even.
Laura: Penniless?
Matt: Everything he owns crumbles to dust.
Travis: Everything.
Matt: All material wealth.
Taliesin: It's why I don't pull cards!
Marisha: How fucked would that be? So fucked.
Sam: Bring it in.
Matt: After this unexpected side venture, you all say your goodbyes for the time being, scatter to the various business you have to. Pike? Is there anything else you wanted to do?
Ashley: Are we leaving?
Matt: Was there anything else this evening you needed to situate? I was going to begin to facilitate the epilogue.
Sam: What do you want to do?
Ashley: Can I grab Keyleth and Vex real quick?
Marisha: Yeah. Girl power.
Ashley: I'll take them to the little spot where I was in the woods.
Laura: Two weeks ago. (laughter)
Travis: Sorry.
Ashley: Okay. So hey, I put something together. It's dumb, but I made a bench and I put Vax's name on it and I didn't want to make him a headstone because that seems so final. Maybe he's still around somewhere.
Laura: He is.
Ashley: I also have these. I take out two of his feathers that I grabbed. And I thought you could put this with the feathers in your hair, Vex and Keyleth, you could do something with this.
Marisha: I think I have the perfect place for this. Thank you.
Laura: Thank you, Pike.
Marisha: Thank you so much.
Ashley: I'm sure you could make it look a little prettier than it is but--
Marisha: I think it's perfect.
Laura: It's absolutely perfect.
Marisha: Where are we going to put it?
Laura: Do you want it out in the woods?
Ashley: Maybe we should just leave it here.
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: I think he'd like that.
Ashley: I think he would too.
Marisha: Something you have to stumble upon. It's a little hidden.
Laura: Yeah, it's stealthy!
Marisha: Stealthy memorial!
Ashley: Okay. I'll let you guys stay. I just wanted to do one more thing. Okay, I walk over to where Scanlan is.
Sam: You mean two weeks ago or are we after--
Matt: No, this is after the random, unexpected Pandemonium trip.
Ashley: Wait, is Grog on the trip or was that--
Matt: Well, no. You guys had to go there to find his soul.
Marisha: Grog was the reason for this season!
Travis: To be fair, nothing really happened in that mind.
Matt: That's true.
Ashley: Hey Scanlan!
Sam: Oi, Pike.
Ashley: How are you doing?
Sam: Now that Percy's arm has healed, I'm fine.
Ashley: Now that was bad, wasn't it?
Sam: Yeah. That bugbear came out of nowhere.
Ashley: The bugbear, you said?
Sam: Don't worry about it. I'm fine.
Ashley: I thought I forgot about that, maybe. Listen, I'm glad you're alive.
Sam: Me too. Thanks for saving us all in that big fight.
Ashley: Thank you for saving us all. I don't really have a whole lot to say, I care for you a lot and I wanted to let you know that.
Sam: I care for you, Pike. I've always loved you since the moment I met you and I'm so happy that we became friends as well.
Ashley: Me too.
Sam: Thank you for everything. Thank you for putting up with me when I was a shit and I hope that I've become more tolerable for you. After all that we've been through, I was wondering if I could ask you a question. I have a proposal for you, if you don't mind. Well, now that everything is safe again and back to normal, I was wondering if I could take you on a date. To a restaurant or something, then maybe if it goes well, we could go on another date and that's it.
Ashley: Well, I actually was going to ask you the same thing!
Sam: Well then. I'll let you do it! No, you do it! I don't want to-- I take it back! I don't ask you on a date!
Marisha: Oh.
Ashley: Oh no.
Sam: Oh no! The internet! Can you hear me, Ashley? (groaning)
Sam: Denied.
Taliesin: That was amazing!
Laura: That was a yes.
Matt: That was a yes.
Sam: That was a yes.
Marisha: It's 2017. When will we will have better Skype?
Taliesin: That's the most Scanlan thing I could have ever hoped for.
Matt: Remember, we're America. We have the worst Internet in the world. Weirdly. Net neutrality. As you guys gather, say your temporary goodbyes, knowing that you're all still very in touch with each other, knowing you care about each other, you begin to forge whatever life looks like outside of perpetual danger and the constant onslaught and struggle of terrors and heroic necessity. Scanlan.
Sam: Oh! Sorry, I'm having a text romance with Ashley Johnson right now.
Matt: Then I'll come back to you.
Sam: No. I'm ready. I can pull myself away from Pike for a second.
Matt: What does Scanlan do in the next year? Next five years, next ten years?
Sam: (clears throat) I have one prepared. Well, she's not here, so I don't know but I wrote down--
Ashley: Can you hear me at all?
Sam: Oh god, I love this!
Ashley: Sorry, my Internet keeps going out.
Travis: It's okay.
Laura: Perfect timing, Ash.
Matt: It's all right. So assuming that you guys went on a date. I'm discussing with Scanlan his epilogue. What does he wish to do in the next year, five and ten years?
Sam: My plan, what I wrote down, was find Kaylie, make sure she's okay. Help Pike repair Vasselheim or literally whatever she wants to do. Give all money to Kaylie except for my platinum bracelets with sapphires worth 2,500 gold that I send anonymously to Sybil to make sure she's taken care of. Long term, I would like to use my Wish/Teleport to check on Kaylie every now and then, at school or wherever she ends up.
Matt: She ends up at the Alabaster Lyceum in Emon, which is one of the highest places of learning. You have connections to the council and with the money that you've given her, she lords over many of the children of the various nobles.
Taliesin: I would have recommended my tutor, but of course, Vax slit his throat right about the time you met him. He was a good tutor before that.
Sam: I don't know but we'll wait until we get to Ashley to find out how things are going with our dating. Otherwise, in my free time, I would love to use my time to write down the epic stories of Vox Machina, from our meeting to saving the world and everything in between. It will be difficult as Scanlan is not an author, but he will rely on guidance from Ioun herself and may even ask Sprigg to be a copy-editor of sorts. The working title is "In the Belly of Dragons: The Legend of Scanlan Shorthalt and Vox Machina". Working title.
Travis: "In the Anus of Dragons," accurately.
Sam: And I hope to finish the book by the time I turn 71.
Travis: How old are you, exactly?
Sam: Oh, I'd be 70. When we started, I was 69.
Laura: You were that young?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: You motherfucker!
Taliesin: You're full of shit.
Laura: Oh my god, I can't believe you were that young.
Travis: This whole time?
Laura: I thought you were 300 years old. Jesus.
Taliesin: Just full of shit.
Sam: I mean, that's about it. I think every once in a while, I would maybe try to see if I could see Vax or check in on him somehow, but I don't know how other than to scry.
Matt: Which does not succeed, but you still send your thoughts and wishes into the ether in hopes that they find their way there. Okay.
Matt: So following off that, the story of Taryon Darrington, which I have something written for here based off what he did. Feel free to embellish or change how you see fit. As the months pass, the Darrington family has adjusted somewhat to a more humble lifestyle, and their work of charity within the city of Deastok and the neighboring lands goes far to clean up the family name from where it once was. While their influence was greatly diminished and they're essentially a political laughingstock, the message of their work still strikes a chord in some of the more philanthropic lords to the north and an alliance is made that protects the Darrington name and interests from the Myriad's ever wiley grasp for the time being. Doty 3.0 now stands a shining golden color, gifted the materials by a thankful ore baron whom Taryon's Brigade of Adventurers saved from a terrifying doppelgänger's plot. His troupe continues to gain a small bit of notoriety in the southern lands of the Dwendalian Empire, some good, some humorous. His mother, Mariya, ever cheering them on and making their tabards for years before passing away peacefully, proud of her boy. Her passing brings the rest of the family closer together than it's ever been. And the charitable efforts, surprisingly, of Howaardt now encompass the Darrington Brigade as a non-profit adventuring league. During a gambling run in Port Demali to follow, Taryon stumbles upon a now slightly more haggard Lawrence, now working as a tanner. They immediately fell right back where they left off and Lawrence cashed in his life as a leather worker to join the Brigade alongside Taryon.
Laura: Oh! That's so great!
Sam: I love it!
Matt: Anything you wish to add to that?
Sam: No, I had written a letter, but yours is much better. Yeah, that's great.
Laura: You wrote a letter?
Sam: I didn't know how much Matt was going to put.
Matt: You could still read the letter.
Sam: I can read the end of the letter.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, Sam.
Sam: No, it's fine. You did good.
Matt: I didn't mean to step on anything you did.
Sam: No, you did great. Much better.
Matt: Pike. Wilhand spends his twilight years helping with small tasks around the emerging House of the Everlight as it is built on the northern edge of Westruun before age finally takes him in peace amongst friends and family. The red-brick house you grew up in and Grog grew along with you for a while is left in your name and there you know you have ever a homestead in Westruun in memory of Wilhand and the friendships you forged. What else would you like to do? What else do you wish to achieve, Pike, as the years go on? That could pertain to you and whatever relationship with Scanlan you wish to embellish on.
Sam: Should we roll for dating? (laughter)
Matt: There's a chart somewhere in second edition.
Ashley: I don't know what Grog's plans are, but I do know if there were any adventuring to be had, that her and Grog got to on some adventures together.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: And that he always has a place in my home and I know I would love to-- I'm sure at this point, fully rebuild the temple in Vasselheim. I think things have gone well with Scanlan. Oh man, I'm getting so emotional.
Sam: Like second-base well or even better than that?
Ashley: Well, I think if we spend enough time together, maybe, I don't know, can we see what else life has for us together?
Sam: Absolutely.
Ashley: That doesn't have to mean anything more. I know your life, what you like to do and I'll give you freedom.
Sam: No, I think the most free I've ever been is with you.
Ashley: I think there's no one I would rather spend the rest of my days with, besides my pal Grog. I think you get a two-for-one deal!
Sam: Sure. The weird family dynamic.
Travis: You guys keep it quiet up there, please?
Sam: Weird roommates. Giant lower floor, tiny upper floor.
Liam: The ceiling is one inch above your head.
Ashley: I think at some point, I ask Scanlan for his hand in marriage.
Sam: I mean, I would have to ask Wilhand for his permission.
Matt: He passed away.
Sam: Well then, I would go leave some flowers at the grave.
Travis: You can ask me.
Sam: Oh, I will ask Grog for permission. Grog, as the father figure in our weird household, I would like to ask for your permission to wed your not-daughter, Pike, who is much smarter and older than you.
Travis: You're a scoundrel. Do you have any money?
Sam: I have this little black rock that you gave me.
Travis: That's worth literally nothing. How about you give her this? And I take out the rare black sapphire and put it in your hand.
Sam: That's pretty good.
Travis: I'm fucking watching you, you understand?
Sam: I won't hurt her, I promise.
Travis: Don't you slip up!
Sam: Nope, I know you could kill me in my sleep.
Travis: I know. I usually put dead people in the bag of holding, but there's always a first! Treat her right.
Sam: Would you walk me down the aisle and by walk me down the aisle, I mean carry me down the aisle? (laughter)
Travis: (high-pitched) Yes.
Sam: All right, let's have a group weird hug.
Matt: Aw. All righty. Anything else, Pike? Are you happy with that?
Sam: Do I have to convert, Pike?
Ashley: What's that?
Sam: Do I have to convert? I'm an Iounian.
Ashley: No.
Sam: Okay, I'm good.
Laura: You're Iounish?
Ashley: Sarenrae's very accepting of other gods.
Sam: Multi-faith ceremony. There you go.
Marisha: 16 rites of passage.
Matt: Anything else, Pike?
Ashley: No.
Matt: Okay. All right, we'll leave it at that. Percival. Vex'ahlia. Since your fates are rather intertwined, I ask you both what are your plans, what are your plots?
Taliesin: I don't really think we should settle down. That seems like a lot.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: I think that I would like to start a very complicated art project that's going to take many years. I'm not going to work on it all the time, day and night, but I'm going to invest some time in this.
Laura: Are you going to be in your shop a lot?
Taliesin: No, I'm going to build a clocktower. Like the one in Prague. I'm going to take many years and it's going to sit at the front of the castle so it will be outside and there will be other people working on it. It will, as a proper clock does, it will tell our story. Once a year, everything will play out.
Laura: Holy shit. That's good.
Taliesin: And we may start inviting tinkering artisans every year for Whitestone to come show off things that are not necessarily useful, but to show off fanciful inventions and things that are beautiful.
Laura: I love that idea.
Taliesin: But let's not stay here too often. (laughter)
Laura: No, although we will have to stay here for nine months every once in a while, because I think we should rebuild the families that we've lost.
Taliesin: There's a lot of names.
Laura: So many names.
Taliesin: So many names.
Matt: How many names?
Taliesin: So many ways to irritate your father.
Laura: Five names.
Taliesin: Oh, at the very least.
Laura: Five.
Marisha: That's a lot of names. Very long names.
Liam: At least three sets of twins. (laughter)
Taliesin: Jesus.
Laura: I definitely want to build a statue to Trinket, the wonder bear.
Marisha: The wonder bear.
Sam: Is he dead?
Laura: No, Trinket's around.
Sam: Damn it.
Laura: So centuries of people in Whitestone will remember their mascot, Trinket.
Marisha: He prevents forest fires. (laughter)
Travis: Ranger's hat.
Laura: As the years pass, we should start a festival and bears will be everywhere.
Taliesin: There will be. Bears will be involved in the festival. Obviously. Especially since the clock tower is part of the festival and bears feature heavily in it.
Laura: Perfect.
Travis: Only you can prevent forest fires.
Taliesin: Only you can prevent the rise of Vecna. (laughter)
Laura: I was hoping to never stop attempting to contact Vax through the temple of the Raven Queen.
Matt: You do notice that the raven population of Whitestone seems to be perpetually seeing blooms every year, far more than it used to.
Laura: I cast Speak with Animals on them and I constantly try to communicate with him.
Matt: Okay, I mean they all seem to be ravens happy to live in this space, but it seems to be more in essence the vicinity more than a specific raven.
Laura: Would you be all right if we increased the Pelor temple here?
Taliesin: Yes, I trust your judgment. It is not for me, but I'm definitely all right with anything that makes you happy.
Laura: Thank you, darling.
Taliesin: To be fair, you'd do it anyway.
Laura: Pretty much, yeah.
Taliesin: I help Cassandra as best I can. I think at least once a year we get out and do something irresponsible.
Laura: Definitely.
Taliesin: Maybe sometimes drag these kids out for shenanigans.
Matt: Cassandra, as a note by the way. She's had a few pretty difficult brushes with death and the experiences definitely left a mark on her. Within the year following the battle with Vecna, she begins to remind you of yourself at a very dark time. Recognizing that, you come to her and help pull her from a dangerous edge of lashing out at the place she's worked so hard to build. You help her realize that this guilt she's been holding as being a tool of manipulation the times that she has been is not her fault and used against the ones she loves. In that determination to no longer be a tool for others to use, she asks Vex to teach her and train her. To not just be the lady beacon of Whitestone, but also join in as one of its protectors.
Laura: At least she had some good promise a long time ago.
Matt: "That was some time, but I've seen what you can do and, well, I deign to think of how dangerous the three of us would be if I could reach your level."
Laura: We'll make you strong, darling.
Taliesin: We also insist that she leave Whitestone at least once a year for a period of time to do fuck all.
Laura: Yeah, there's a beautiful place called Dalen's Closet. I think you would love it.
Taliesin: Let's not, well yes, there's, well.
Matt: Anything else? You guys happy with that?
Taliesin: I'm content to make a clock tower and make art and never make another weapon. I'm good.
Matt: Hmm, all right.
Laura: I have "Make Whitestone the tits," written in my notes of things that I want to do.
Taliesin: It's got a bear. I'm imagining the bear from Burning Man actually.
Marisha: Penny Bear.
Laura: Yeah, Penny Bear. I like it.
Matt: There you go. Grog.
Travis: I'm so fascinated by Vasselheim. I have so many interests that I feel it only proper to go back and turn myself in to the authorities for punching one of the guards in the face and take whatever punishment they have for me.
Matt: All right, as you head back to the district in which these incursions happened, you are immediately recognized and much to their completely taken aback reaction they bring you in until somebody of the higher Bastions goes, "You fools. This is one of Vox Machina. What's wrong with you?" "Oh I didn't--" And they all point up at the large titan which is--
Travis: Yeah, up top, that's where we were.
Matt: Which currently has been cleared out of any cursed undead that they know of. It's a process that takes a while, but it becomes a monument to that battle and it becomes converted into a symbol of hope for the city. For generations to come in Vasselheim, that titan will stand there, lording over the city, as a reminder of what transpired, of what could have been lost, and what was saved that day in memory of those that were lost. And as you point up to that and they all realize, they slowly remove your shackles.
Travis: Oh, I'm free to go?
Matt: "Yes, sir. Thank you, thank you."
Travis: That's unexpected. Could you point me in the direction of a library?
Matt: "Sure, come with me." As you begin to walk out you watch as a familiar figure steps up to this portion of the Bastions' guard post, you see a familiar merchant who rushes up and goes, "I was being summoned. They found the-- why's he walking free?"
Travis: Yes. You. You will come with me.
Matt: "Gentlemen, this is the man who punched me. This is the man who ruined my business. I can--"
Travis: Gentlemen, whose word are you going to take? The savior of Vasselheim, or his new tutor?
Matt: "What?" (laughter)
Matt: The guards go, "Cobalt Reserve library station is down that way to the left. Hard to miss, big blue dome. You two work this out." And they retract back into the guard post, leaving the two of you in the street.
Travis: Well, unless you have something better to do, you could contribute to one of the greatest people to ever pass through this city and help me learn to read a little bit more. Would that be a problem? I only have 8,000 gold to give you.
Matt: Make a persuasion check with advantage.
Sam: 8,000 gold.
Travis: Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: (laughter) Didn't even need the advantage. All right.
Sam: 8,000 gold.
Matt: "Well, that would certainly go far for reparations for the damage you've caused to both my business, my person and my psyche." (laughter)
Matt: "But I'm curious to see what this change of heart is, so sure. But you're going to pay upfront."
Travis: Yes, 8,000 gold.
Matt: "Holy shit."
Travis: I could carry it if you want.
Matt: "We'll just make a quick stop over by my shop, please."
Travis: Fair enough.
Matt: And he drags it and it leaves this big heavy groove in the ground as he pulls it along. "Nope, nope, it's good, I got it" (struggling noises) And leads you to the Cobalt Reserve and for as long as you'll have him he'll begin to tutor you.
Travis: I'd like to learn to read a bit more. I'd like to split some time in the temple of Kord.
Matt: Which takes a while to get rebuilt and you probably help out a bit, too, Earthbreaker Groon, who survived, though many of his--
Travis: Oh, he did survive.
Matt: He did survive, yeah. He's made of hardier stuff.
Travis: I'd also like to bring Pike out every once in a while and we give challengers a shot in the Crucible, but mostly I'm trying to improve my mind and looking for the next challenge.
Matt: I like it.
Liam: Bring him up to eight intelligence.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Seven's a good start. (laughter)
Matt: Perfect. Happy with that?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, then. Keyleth.
Marisha: (sighs) Okay. Naturally, help Pike rebuild Vasselheim in the most immediate of circumstances. Eventually retire to Zephra. Go be the actual leader of my people. Continue to get in any type of frays that these people invite me on as it reminds me of the good old days and keeps my promise to protect this realm any time this realm needs protecting. And I find Kerrick at some point. Seek out Kerrick. Make sure he's okay. Reconnect with him, have coffee, you know.
Matt: Yeah. He's a quick jaunt from Zephra, thankfully. Westruun's not that far. That's one of the closer large cities outside of Stillben.
Marisha: Perfect. We're weekend buddies.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: We go to wine country. And then I work on the propagated sprig from the Sun Tree and continue to build it out, hopefully on the ley lines of the planet, and I take the feather that Pike gave me from Vax and I embed it into the trunk of the tree as well as any other relics from the Raven Queen I can find. Care for ravens as much as I can.
Matt: There is an uptick of ravens in the space of Zephra as well. Not many, but more than there would be, which is usually zero.
Marisha: And from the branch of the Sun Tree create my own raven tree of the Ashari. Take a long, long, long, long, long time before I maybe date again. Maybe. But eventually, hopefully, after a long, long, long, long, long time sunset into the tree and become a part of this realm.
Matt: That's a ways off for you, Ms. Archdruid.
Marisha: Ways off.
Matt: But you begin those preparations.
Marisha: But that's the plan.
Matt: Okay. Well you, Keyleth, who many only once saw the naive druid girl have a level of respect now that's carried with that mantle that you hold. And the council of Tal'Dorei occasionally calls upon your wisdom and guidance. The alliance between the civilised and the natured world of the lands irrevocably in Tal'Dorei bound to you at this point, between you and the earth Ashari who reside up in the Cliffkeep. Between occasional jaunts to Emon and Whitestone, you find renewed joy in the protection of the people there. One cold Cuersaar the 13th, the tenth month of the year, the cool summer dusk day closes and you emerge from the quarters to find that the winds come and blow through your hair. You step out to the sound of children laughing as a dozen Ashari kids, elf, dwarf, orc, many bloods and creeds rush past as they play. It's a familiar sound. It's a happy sound. You glance over at this village you're protecting and the people that truly look up to you as their leader, both not just from a might source but as a guide. And you look to them to teach you things every day as well. Looking past as the sun begins to set, you see Korrin standing by the cherry blossom at the edge of the cliff near the amphitheatre where you had your ceremony. In pinks and oranges and purples, the sunset takes the sky. As you approach, he still looks out. He's older, not too much older but older. As he notices you approach, he looks over. "In all my years, not a day passes where awe does not strike me at the beauty of this world." He looks over towards the sunset. "Don't ever lose the memory of every face whose strength helped you keep this light from fading. Every single face."
Marisha: I don't think it's the faces that keep this light from fading. I think it is what it is. We're lucky to experience it, a few are lucky to think it's beautiful. You taught me that. I don't have to appreciate this. Especially not after what I've seen. But I do.
Matt: "You need to."
Marisha: Only because of what I've seen.
Matt: And you see a bit of heartbreak but he nods his head and reaches out and takes you in, holds you there on the cliff side, the winds just being kept at bay. "I'm proud of you."
Marisha: Thank you. It's all I ever wanted. It's weird, once you reach a life goal and then realize you have the rest of your life. I guess I just find new goals. Sometimes it's hard being a prodigy because then you just grow up to be a regular adult.
Matt: He pulls you in tighter. "You'll always be my girl. My little Keyleth."
Marisha: Thanks, Dad.
Matt: "I love you."
Marisha: I love you.
Matt: (sighs) "Anyway, I should get to seeing if dinner preparations are being made. Looks to be a cold night." He tugs your hand and walks back, leaves you there on the cliff side looking out. As the sunlight slowly blinks away over the horizon, leaving you with the purples and blues of the night sky as the stars begin to glitter up, you can hear a raven caw catch your ear as you glance up into the branches of the cherry blossom tree. There's just one raven.
Marisha: Blow a kiss.
Matt: Flies down, lands on your shoulder. It's a bigger raven than any you've seen before. You've not seen this raven around.
Marisha: Little scratch.
Matt: It leans into it. And every day that raven comes to visit. And that's where we're going to close the campaign.
Sam: What a nice story.
Laura: Wow.
Travis: Let's do it again. (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: Oh, wow. When this chapter closes, a whole new one, a whole new one opens very soon. (sighs) We'll be back in the new year with a new story to tell and in the meantime we'll be playing games here and mixing it up. Being silly. A few other faces are going to take up the storytelling mantle here. Me and Marisha have a wedding in a little over a week.
Marisha: Oh god. I had to get past this emotional chapter so I could get through the next one. (laughter)
Matt: But here we are at the end of this near-five-year journey for us and near-three-year journey with all of you and I just want to appreciate having, honestly, some of the best friends and players I could ever hope for to come along on this journey, to trust me enough to build this with you and to give back so much more than I could have ever hoped.
Liam: Thank you, Matt.
Laura: Thank you.
Marisha: Best DM ever.
Matt: You guys make it all easy and worthwhile.
Laura: Oh fuck.
Matt: Love you guys.
Laura: Shit. Yay!
Matt: And love you guys, each and every one of you out there who've come with us on this journey; new, old, for just a bit, or the entire length, some of you multiple times. Thank you for joining in on whatever this weird little magical, curious experience has, and will continue to be. Promise me you'll be good.
Marisha: We'll be back.
Laura: Yeah, we'll be back.
Liam: We might look a little different, but we're still going to be here.
Matt: Yep!
Laura: That was a really pretty sendoff, Matt. Thank you.
Marisha: That was beautiful.
Sam: Thanks, Matt. That was really nice.
Matt: Love you, guys.
Laura: Love you, Matthew.
Matt: Love you, guys. Have a wonderful night. Rest well. And is it Thursday yet?
