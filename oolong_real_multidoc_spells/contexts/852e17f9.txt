[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us voice actors get together and roll dice like we're awesome nerd people, which we are. So, welcome! We're going to do a couple quick announcements here before we kick things off. You want to go ahead and start?
Zac: Yeah, I'm that guy that you can't wait to stop talking so the show can get started. So guys, last week we hit 516 on the sub-train. Okay? And each week, in theory, should grow by itself because re-subs count. So basically, if we break 516 and make a new record, we will do a giant giveaway which includes everything from Heroclix to Steam keys to D&D schwag, books from Felicia, all sorts of stuff. It will be a giant box of wonderful Geek and Sundry-related stuff. So that is if we break 516, so there's a reason to keep that train alive, guys. We are also very close to hitting 10k. We are like 160 away from reaching 10,000 subscribers. How many? 154 away from hitting 10k. Now you guys may remember #noshavetil10k. I have not. If we hit 10k, right when we hit, a straw poll will be released into the chatroom, and you guys get to vote on what my face gets shaved into for the next week of programming on G&S. And it is very unfortunate that that's how we're going to do it. So tomorrow night on Gather Your Party, it will be Stef and Jessica's birthday, we're going to be throwing a birthday party, and I'm going to let them shave my face in whatever you guys vote on, as a birthday present to them.
Marisha: So many things.
Matt: The possibilities are endless.
Zac: Just saying that out loud honestly hurts me. A lot.
Matt: It is thick, too. You can get some nice dimension in there.
Zac: Great.
Liam: Words, shave words in--
Taliesin: You could build a bear in the beard.
Zac: I could build a bear. Yeah. Great.
Matt: Can we shave off bits and then re-apply them to other parts of the face?
Zac: If you want to wear them, yeah!
Matt: Okay! I might do that, yeah.
Zac: And then this weekend, Nerdist is running a 24-hour livestream for Extra Life. You guys may recognize some of the faces that stop by. They are going to be streaming from our set. So, let's welcome them. We'll be hosting it, but I encourage you guys all to head over to Nerdist, twitch.tv/nerdist. This weekend it'll be Saturday from 9AM to 9PM Pacific Standard Time. I will be there the whole time helping out, as well as some of our other Geek and Sundry hosts. So you guys should check that out and help them be part of our team, raising money for Extra Life. And Matt, I wanted to thank you for helping us make Battle of the Bands a success last week. We all know that the voting was rigged and that's why your team won, but it was a valiant effort nonetheless. And if you guys enjoyed that, you should tweet at Geek and Sundry's twitter and let them know, and we will try to do things like that for you more in the future. That's pretty much all I have. Let's get to 10k and get this stupid stuff off my face.
Matt: Thank you very much, Zac. Speaking of shaving, let me take a moment here to mourn the Mercer-beard. Those who saw on twitter. I was trying to hold off until 10k and Halloween for my costume, but due to work, had to shave it as of last night. So, I apologize. I'm in mourning. So please bear with me for this evening, going forward. Couple announcements. Critical Role-related: we have a lot of our party in transit right now. Laura and Travis just flew in from Toronto and will probably be a little bit late to the game. Sam is currently heading here from a session and will get here as soon as possible. Unfortunately, Orion will not be joining us again this evening, but hope to have him back next week for Halloween. So, things will get rolling as they arrive. Thankfully, we're at a situation in the game where I don't think it'll be too halting. We shall see. Next announcement, we're putting out Critical Role thematic playlists. All the players have put together playlists of Spotify songs that they feel encapture aspects of their character and their character's journeying as Vox Machina and in the world of Exandria. So those will be releasing every week, starting tonight at 8PM with Percy, I believe. So Taliesin's playlist will be up available on Geek and Sundry's website and--
Taliesin: Dropping mad jams-- I'm not.
Marisha: They're mad, you're allowed.
Taliesin: I'm going to show you some music.
Marisha: It's good. Go download Spotify right now, so you can go, if you haven't. It's free!
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: It's cancer. It's been a weird weeknight.
Marisha: It has. It's been a long day.
Taliesin: I had a strange day. I've infected friends with Spotify now.
Matt: As you should. Infecting friends is fun. Couple other things. For those who haven't seen it already, the D&Diesel videos went up earlier this week, where we had the wonderful chance-- for me, at least-- to Dungeon Master for a half an hour for Vin Diesel, along with Travis and Laura, and Jessica and Dan of Nerdist ilk. Had a great time, so hopefully you liked it, and if you'd like to see more stuff like that, hopefully we'll have more things coming up in the future in that vein, because we had a good time. Also, along with that, I released my Witch Hunter class, which was a customized 5th edition class that I designed after I ran that game, based on the character I created for Vin. It went up on the website, untested. Feedback is always welcome, and I will be updating it on the website as feedback comes in and balancing is tweaked for it. But have at it, have fun, hope you guys enjoy it. I had a good time creating it, and it's a good time. Also, just a reminder to you guys: our official Critical Role t-shirts are available on the Geek and Sundry website store if you want to wear any of the awesome red shirts that we've shown on the show with our full-on Critical Role logo. Shown in an exemplary dark, fine ink. Those are available for purchase.
Marisha: And keychains.
Taliesin: What if, due to some strange third-arm syndrome, I can't wear t-shirts; is there any way I can show my support to the show?
Matt: Yes, you can. We have necklaces and keychains with our logo as well. Also available on the store. So, you're welcome to check those out.
Taliesin: With my third arm, I need necklaces and keychains.
Liam: Three-armed shirts are coming in 2016.
Matt: Yeah, three-armed shirts will be on the docket. Thank you, Liam, I was trying to get to that.
Marisha: There's a new shirt up. I didn't know that.
Matt: We have a new shirt up?
Offscreen: How do you want to do this.
Matt: We have it up?! This is good news to know. We have now up on the store our official "How do you want to do this" shirt as well. So you can go check that out on the shop. Prepare for the holiday season with your Christmases and your Chanukahs and your Critmases and all that fun stuff to make people look as nerdy as we are. Which is I think part of my goal, personally, through world domination. (laughter)
Matt: Maybe not Liam. Everyone but Liam can look weird. There's no way to help you.
Liam: Can I just interject for a second only because I'm hot as hell. I just want to thank @pupgames on twitter for making me this fabulous stealthy cloak. I'm going to take it off in about two minutes, because it's more t-shirt weather here in the studio. So I'll just let everybody bask in the glow of my absence of light for two minutes, and then I'm going to switch to t-shirt mode.
Taliesin: You're so stealthy.
Marisha: Where'd Liam go?
Matt: It's mysterious.
Marisha: Holy shit.
Matt: All righty. Also, our cast interviews on the Geek and Sundry website are almost over. Orion's went up today and those will be finishing up shortly.
Marisha: But we have Spotify lists to replace them.
Matt: Yep, Spotify lists coming up.
Marisha: So there's still more content.
Matt: If you've missed any of the cast interviews, they're all available on the website. So feel free to check them out.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Marisha, you wanted to follow up on the 826LA news you had.
Marisha: Yes. 826LA, they're in a campaign right now for-- let me try to get all this right-- for LA 2050 which is a big contest that's sponsored by Goldhirsh, right now, and it's all for sponsoring education and a brighter future for Los Angeles. So 826LA and Young Storytellers are actually partnering together, and they're in this contest right now. You have to go vote, and they could potentially win $100,000. Which: awesome. And we've got Critters. I think they'll win. So you have to go vote. I tweeted the link, so the mods, go find it on my twitter, or you can just search #LA2050, and you should be able to find it. So, yeah, go vote.
Matt: Team Hooman, Critters, come up there and make this happen.
Marisha: Also, they just announced they're going to be opening an 826LA-- sorry, not 826LA, but an 826 in San Francisco!
Matt: Awesome!
Taliesin: Another 826 in San Francisco?
Marisha: Oh, is there another, I guess so.
Taliesin: Yeah, because there's one there--
Marisha: They might be opening a second one.
Taliesin: They might be opening-- that would make sense.
Marisha: I think they said they announced they're opening one. I think.
Taliesin: I'm retweeting you right now.
Marisha: Okay. Taliesin's retweeting me.
Matt: So there you go. Follow either of their twitters to get the information.
Marisha: But, go vote. Help them win 100k.
Matt: All right, Taliesin, you wanted to mention something about Tara's--
Taliesin: I do! Tara Platt, who is a wonderful friend of the show and amazing voice actress and extremely fabulous in many different ways; she's a sky pirate, she does all sorts of crazy stuff. She's got an Indiegogo for an interactive book called, and I'm hoping I pronounce this right, Zartana. You should check it out, it's really cool, it's really pretty and beautiful. It's got a very Stardust-y vibe. I've already picked up my copy. So you should go, there's just a couple days left, just hop in and grab a copy for yourself. It's going to be really exciting. And--
Marisha: Yeah, it's like about a g*psy girl, and it's got a bunch of recipes, and it teaches you how to make a bow, and has herb cards and all sorts of cool stuff. I was into it immediately.
Taliesin: For the cool child in your life this Christmas. This would be for the kid who needs something that's not quite outdoors, but not quite a video game.
Marisha: Zartana.
Taliesin: Zartana.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: Also, I will be in OniCon in Galveston, Texas over Halloween. So, if you're in Galveston, Texas and it's Halloween, and you want to go to an anime con, I'll be there. And I'll be in costume, and it will be pretty hilarious.
Marisha: And last, but not least, last Thursday while we were here, looking at dead versions of ourselves hanging from a tree, Super Power Beat Down won a Geekie!
Liam: Oh! Mazel tov!
Marisha: Yeah, glad I came here instead of going to the award show. Totally worth it. But we won a Geekie. So, I thought I should say that.
Liam: Well-earned.
Marisha: Thanks.
Liam: You nerd.
Matt: Good on you.
Taliesin: You should wear it like bling. Get a chain for it. That'd be great.
Marisha: Just, once again, like, it-- No.
Taliesin: No. No, never mind.
Matt: All righty, any other announcements anyone needs to make?
Taliesin: God damn it, it keeps happening.
Liam: I'm good.
Matt: All righty. Well then, let us go ahead and get ourselves tuned in for tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. So, everyone, our Sam arrived--
Sam: Samurai?
Taliesin: Samurai?
Matt: We have our samurai! Laura and Travis are in transit, they'll be here as soon as they-- (thump from Sam's mug)
Matt: Well played. So. To give us a little overview of the current story. Two nasty individuals known as the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, have, for the past five years, been occupying the city of Whitestone, which was once the home to Percival here, after it was forcefully taken from his family, most of which seemingly have been either killed or lost in the process, and he was scattered to the four winds to find Vox Machina. After encountering the Briarwoods in Emon in a scuffle that took place, the Briarwoods retreated to Whitestone, inviting the party to come and say hello. Since then, the party has prepared the best they could, made their way towards Whitestone, and, through some bit of infiltration and subterfuge, managed to sneak into the city itself. They, under the guise of Scanlan's Seeming illusion, appeared to be as common folk as the rest of the poor saps that still live in Whitestone. They scoped out an abandoned tavern, which they fitted to their needs as a base of operations, and also managed to come across a central portion of Whitestone's city structure and history, known as the Sun Tree, a tree once risen to the might of the god of the sun, Pelor, now lies dead in the center of town, and from it hung eight figures that appear to have been individuals killed, hung, and painted up and dressed to resemble Vox Machina as essentially a warning, or a welcome. It's hard to tell when it comes to the Briarwoods. Nevertheless, a message was definitely delivered. The party, retreating back to the tavern, set up for the remainder of the afternoon. Keyleth carved, through her druidic magical ways, through the ground to find some of the roots of the Sun Tree, and began preparing an extensive, time-consuming ritual in hopes of restoring some semblance of life to the entity itself. That is where we left off. While the rest of you have been going about your preparations for the rest of the afternoon as this ritual for Keyleth is an eight-hour ritual and it begun in the early afternoon around 2:00, so this will conclude by around sundown, a little past sundown. While she is down there, essentially meditating with the barren roots of the Sun Tree, is there anything you guys would wish to do, or are you just waiting for her to complete her ritual?
Taliesin: Well, there are options.
Sam: What do we need? We have to get water, right? There was some issue about-- we don't have any water, do we?
Taliesin: Was that an issue?
Sam: I don't remember. There was some wells around.
Marisha: Can I do a few checks while I'm preparing the ritual to see if this is a curse over this tree?
Matt: Go ahead and make a religion check, I guess.
Marisha: Not great. Hang on, my ring of protection is in the way. Nine.
Matt: Nine. Honestly, it's hard to tell if it's a curse, the tree itself is just dead. You are very well-connected with the natural essences of the world, the life essence of plants and natural growth. All of your interactions with the Sun Tree are devoid of any response. It seems dead where it stands. But, as you continue your ritual--
Marisha: God, I hope this works.
Matt: Anyone else have anything they want to do?
Liam: Well, couple of things. Grog and I were keeping watch. I forget, one of us was on the first floor and one's on the second. I'm just going to say that I was on the second for now. Because I can't remember. It's probably wrong. I'm going to take all daggers out of my Blinkback Belt except for the Keen Dagger and replace them with wooden stakes that I purchased. And I'm going to spend an hour or so, whatever it takes to-- I've got partial gloves on; I'm going to take that symbol of Sarenrae and I'm going to take as much time as it needs to sew it so that it is fixed firmly to the back of my right hand. I tell Grog that I'm going to go down below and check, and I follow the path all the way down to find-- I think everyone else is down there.
Sam: Oh hi, Vax.
Liam: I step over Scanlan's head and I kneel down by Keyleth and gently place a hand on her shoulder and say: What do you need? What can I get?
Marisha: I don't really know. I don't know if this is going to work, to be totally honest. The tree is dead. Do you have any of that holy water?
Liam: I got holy oil. Not water.
Marisha: Do I have holy water? I don't know if I took one or not. I can't remember.
Matt: If you didn't write it down, it's not in your inventory.
Marisha: I'm pretty good about that. I don't think I took one.
Taliesin: In the meantime, there are options.
Liam: I got two. I remember it. It was two vials of holy oil. I gave one to my sister, and I have the other. If you think it will help, you take it.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: Do you need me to get water?
Marisha: Yeah, let's get some water.
Matt: Yeah, because as you guys went through the tavern, you found there was no actual water. There was old ale. There were still a few casks of wine. Stuff that was abandoned when whoever previously was the owner of this tavern either left Whitestone or fell to a worse fate. But there was no plain water to drink.
Liam: I'm going to go out into the street. I'm going to find water.
Taliesin: I can show you where there's water.
Sam: What?
Taliesin: I lived here my whole life.
Sam: Are you guys disguised?
Liam: Yeah, we all are.
Matt: They're still technically under your Seeming spell, for the next few hours, at least.
Marisha: Yeah, we cannot let that go.
Sam: Does that have a range? No, it just lasts.
Matt: As far as I know, it lasts just for an eight-hour period. I'll double-check.
Liam: Percival, do you want to come upstairs to the window, and--
Sam: I'm coming.
Liam: Oh, you're coming, too? All right. You're my son, let's go. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, it lasts for eight hours and allows you to change the appearance of--
Sam: Great. We're still peasants.
Marisha: Remember, we also have Heroes' Feast up.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Marisha: Advantages on wisdom throws and whatnot.
Taliesin: Hit point bonus, advantage on wisdom throws--
Marisha: Yeah. 2d10 hit points. Max hit points.
Taliesin: I have my advantages still. So I'm going to lead them to the closest well.
Matt: Okay. Stealthily?
Marisha: I'm going to start-- I've kind of cleared out around the roots.
Matt: It's a lot. It's earth and then giant roots from a very large tree that go past. You aren't at the bottom of the roots. You've met the roots as you were carving through. They go even deeper than where you are right now.
Marisha: Yeah. Can I start carving a little ravine around it for where we're going to start pouring the water?
Matt: If you've already started the eight-hour process of the secondary spell, you would not be able to really interrupt that to be able to continue another spell you've been doing. I could say that you did that as part of your preparation for the roots. That's fine. That's fine. It'd be a small ravine, because you also don't want to--
Marisha: Damage anything.
Matt: You continue your ritual. The rest of you make your way out the same window that you entered, into the alleyway, following Percival. You lead them to the back of the tavern into one of the large alleyways between this chunk of the city. You find there was a grassy area; most of the grass here has turned gray and brittle, as it is starting to push towards the winter months. And even for the daytime, the temperature is pretty chilly. It's probably around 50 or so degrees, 55. Fahrenheit, for our un-American friends. Eventually, you make your way to the nearest well that you've been to. And there is a bucket there. It looks like it has gathered some dust and some cobwebs. You get the bucket, and you let it down, and eventually it finds its way into the water. It's pretty deep before it hit the water. You don't know if it's been just, like, water level, or if this particular well itself is drying up. But you manage to get a bucket up, and you pull it up and check it and it looks clear. You take the water back with you to the tavern. Seemingly uneventful. You guys have managed to stay far enough out of sight. Nothing seems to caught your attention.
Sam: Okay. Should we scout around and see if there's anything else around the hideout that we should be aware of, or any other hiding places, or safehouses?
Liam: I feel like we should probably bring a little more water than one bucket. So we should spend a little bit of time doing that. But maybe my sister and I can have a look around, see if there's anything that we've missed. Outside.
Taliesin: Well, here's the question. There's three lordly houses that we have to avoid at all costs, for now. There's a few shops that if we feel might be in our best interest to scout out. I know where an old weapons depot used to be. We could check the temples to maybe see if we could maybe find some support to begin with.
Liam: Do we trust anyone here?
Sam: We need friends.
Taliesin: There might be people I trust.
Sam: Is there a central meeting place?
Taliesin: There's a temple.
Sam: Is that a place where you can really chat up brand new people? Or is there a pub? I guess it's not really a pub town, is it?
Taliesin: It's not a pub town. And it's a place where you don't necessarily chat up new people, but maybe find some old ones.
Sam: Okay. We could go there.
Liam: Percival, we're on your turf, so I'll follow your lead.
Taliesin: (sighs) If we have just enough time, I'd like to try to go to the temple and the cemetery. Leave, maybe Grog and Vex to guard Keyleth.
Matt: Okay. So, Keyleth, you're staying behind to finish the ritual?
Marisha: I'm doing what I do best. And I focus all my energy on this thing.
Matt: There are two temples in here. There's the temple to Pelor, which is known as the Zenith. Within the graveyard.
Taliesin: Yes, the Zenith is the one I wanted to go to.
Sam: What's the other one?
Taliesin: The other one is called The Lady's Chamber. It's a temple of Erathis.
Sam: That sounds fun.
Taliesin: I don't know anybody there.
Sam: I might!
Taliesin: That's what I'm afraid-- they might know you, so no.
Matt: So the Lady's Chamber, the temple to Erathis, is more central to the city and is partially a courtyard, partially a half-dome amphitheater place of worship. You guys make your way through the city. I'll have you all roll stealth checks if you could.
Sam: We're not trying to hide, are we?
Matt: Well, if you're not trying to hide, then make deception checks instead.
Taliesin: Awesome possum.
Sam: I rolled an 18 for something.
Liam: Can I choose to hide instead of deceive?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Liam: Yeah, I'll hang a little bit back from them.
Taliesin: I was trying to be stealthy, as well.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Although I'm fine either way. 23.
Sam: I'm better deceiving.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 26.
Matt: So we have two folks staying to the shadows, best they can in broad daylight in a clustered city. And one child-looking pauper of a boy wandering through the city alone towards the graveyard. As you guys make your way through, staying off to the side, jumping, or running through buildings and staying off the main path, you walk along the central road to the far eastern side of Whitestone. A few folks come out during the day, some are carrying bundles of textile goods. There's one guy that has a small cart, and it looks like he's bringing tools and stuff either to or from a store of some kind. Gives you a curious look as if he hasn't seen you before but doesn't seem to--
Sam: G'day, sir!
Matt: "G'day!" And just keeps rolling along, the wheels squeaking as he pushes up the road.
Sam: I wish I had a yo-yo.
Taliesin: How about a wheel and stick?
Sam: Oh, the wheel and stick would be good.
Matt: Eventually, you guys make your way to the far eastern side of Whitestone. This is where the boundary wall that surrounds most of the city from a defensive standpoint lies. There is the multiple exit points throughout this wall. You dart around the outskirts of it, being careful to avoid the pattern of the undead giants that are slowly stomping through the city, like these hulking sentinels that walk in a perpetual pattern through the town. You follow the winding path through the thick woods, just on the outside of the wall of the city itself. You sticking to the path in your open way, or do you want to join them in the side of the forest?
Sam: Well, I've got to stick with them, I guess, although I like being a young peasant boy. It's kind of fun. All right, I'll go with them.
Matt: All right. So the three of you dart off into the woods, skirting the outside of the road, but making your way following it to the outside of the graveyard itself. Eventually, you come to the outside of the graveyard. Large iron fence that marks the outside of it. It's rusted from time, small spikes mark the very top of it, about six feet tall, and the gate itself is partially open. With a little bit of breeze that's blowing through, very, very cold breeze that blows through this part of the forest, it's opening a little bit, and (creak) against itself. You push through the gate--
Liam: Wait a minute, nope. Let me look. I'm just going to move in, ten feet ahead, and see what I see.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: That is a 23 for perception.
Matt: Okay. You skirt up and look inside. And there's a handful of trees in little clusters here and there, but for the most part this old graveyard is flat land, with just stones set up throughout. The older stones have very little rhyme or reason to their placement. They're sporadically thrown around, fresher ones tend to be more clustered with family names. This definitely looks like something that was put here when the town was founded and has been slowly expanded over time, and it's not uniform.
Liam: I hiss back at Percy  is this the way to your temple?
Taliesin: (whispers) Yes.
Liam: Through here?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: You do see, a little ways ahead in the center of this open barren area, there is a stone temple that has, from what little you can see, a bit of stained glass pattern to it.
Liam: Do we knock?
Sam: Is it safe? Should we go up?
Taliesin: We go up to the doors, and give it a tug.
Matt: Okay. Percy walks up to the doors.
Liam: Well, all right.
Taliesin: This is my neighborhood. I feel comfortable.
Matt: Okay. You--
Sam: All right, Papa, let's go.
Matt: You go to the doors of the temple, the large wooden doors. In them are carved this flaming wreath into the wood. It looks almost like the outer ring of the classical depiction of a sun and going across the sky where you can see the waving flames licking the sides of the actual doors. And it is a double door. As you tug on the handle at the front, it gives very little to you. You give a little more of a tug on it, not enough to gather attention, just enough to really see if it's just stuck, or if it's locked. And it appears that the doors are not opening.
Liam: And I look--
Sam: This is what he does!
Liam: It is what I do. This is an old, old type of lock, hold on.
Matt: There is no lock, actually.
Liam: There's no lock? Oh, but I rolled a natural 20. Does that help? Let me get through the door?
Taliesin: Suddenly, a lock appears! Utterly pickable! (laughter)
Marisha: Utterly pickable! It's the most pickable lock I've ever seen!
Matt: There is no lock. It is barred from the other side. There is some heavy wooden plank that is currently set on the other side of the door.
Liam: Oh, where's Grog when you need him?
Matt: So, with your expertise in these sort of circumstances, you know that with the proper placement of a long blade and enough strength and weight put at the right fulcrum point, you can probably shimmy it off, and it may take a little bit of teamwork to do so.
Liam: Okay who's got a-- mine are all very small. Do you have a shortsword?
Sam: Everything I have is short. I can just go in there and open it from the inside.
Liam: Oh, right. I always forget.
Sam: It's not concentration, so I can just jump in there.
Matt: Essentially.
Liam: Don't fuse with a church pew.
Matt: If you're referring to a Dimension Door--
Sam: Correct. It's not concentration, I don't think.
Matt: No, it is not concentration.
Liam: More of a sneeze.
Matt: You can visualize it. It doesn't have to be a place you have seen yet.
Sam: I can say I want to go ten feet in that direction.
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Before I do, why are we trying to get in here? I thought it was to meet people. I don't think there's anyone in there.
Taliesin: I would like to find out what happened.
Sam: Okay, good enough for me. I go in.
Matt: Okay. (spoof) With a burst of dark purplish energy, Scanlan steps through the door, leaving no mark or trace behind. On the other side you hear this muffled (spoof) as he reappears on the opposite side, completing his transition. You appear now in the central worship hall of the Zenith temple. To each side of you, you can see there are windows, about ten foot wide, stained glass windows, about every ten feet around this pattern, it looks like three to each side. There are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and worship, but a lot of the pews have been pushed off to the side, set astray, some have been destroyed and ruined. There's a pile in the corner of a number of sundered and tattered pews. There is a red carpet that marks the center that goes all the way to what looks like a raised altar on the opposite side of the room. You can see that some of the stained glass further down has been shattered and broken, and a little bit of sunlight creeps through. You can see there is on the altar a large stone platform. It's hard to see from this distance. Make a perception check.
Liam: (muffled) Scanlan! Open the door.
Sam: We do have earrings. 17.
Matt: There appears to be something on the the altar in the distance, small and scattered about it, but from this distance, it's hard to make out the details. But you hear Vax muffled through the door.
Sam: All right, how big is this thing that's keeping the door shut?
Matt: It's about eight feet wide and about a foot-- eight feet long, about a foot wide and about six inches thick. A big old piece of wooden board.
Sam: A couple hundred pounds?
Matt: I would say it probably weighs about 40 or 50 pounds.
Sam: 40 or 50 pounds?!
Matt: It's wood. It's porous.
Sam: And how high off the ground? Could I touch it?
Matt: You could touch it. It gets to about your head, a little higher.
Sam: All right. I'm going to try and lift it off.
Matt: Go ahead a make a strength check. Athletics! Make this athletics.
Sam: Athletics? Hmm. Not good. 12!
Matt: (grunting) From this position, it's not even budging.
Liam: All right, Scanlan, step back from the door a couple of paces. I'm going to stick a blade through the door.
Sam: It's not going to do much. There's a big heavy thing.
Liam: I'm going to hold on one side, you're going to hold on the other, and we'll do it together. Percy, can I borrow your blade?
Taliesin: I've never used this. I've had it since I created the character and I've never used this blade once. This is the most use it's ever gotten. I pull out this pristine piece of shit (laughs) I don't even remember. I think I found it in a dungeon. It's terrible.
Matt: What is it?
Taliesin: It's a boarding sword, it was one of those little curved swords.
Matt: Right. A scimitar or falchion.
Taliesin: A scimitar. But short. It was nothing, it was terrible.
Liam: It's all we need.
Taliesin: Yeah so. Get it in there.
Liam: Scanlan, grab some rags or something, wrap it around the blade. You're going to lift on your side; we're going to lift on this side.
Sam: I get the sharp side?!
Liam: I can't get the handle through the crack in the door.
Sam: All right. I feel like there's some sort of spell I could use. All right, let's just do it your way.
Liam: Got that Bigby's Hand, is that what you're saying?
Sam: Yeah, I've got a million things I could do.
Taliesin: Are any of them concentration spells?
Sam: Bigby's is probably concentration, but I've also got a potion of strength.
Matt: As a note, Seeming isn't concentration.
Sam: I thought it was.
Matt: No. You cast it and it lasts for eight hours. You don't need to worry about that.
Sam: No, I want to follow this through.
Taliesin: Let's keep going.
Liam: All right. Can we lift it together?
Matt: (laughs) We can try. All right, so. This is going to be the three of you as a skill challenge, I want all three of you to roll. Not athletics, just a straight strength roll.
Taliesin: One, two, three.
Matt: Add your strength modifier.
Taliesin: 16!
Sam: Plus strength. 12. (laughter)
Sam: Wait, did you get a four? Four? We are the worst! We are the weakest ones. Oh, I cut my hand!
Matt: Which is exactly what happens.
Taliesin: Bigby's Hand? Bigby's Hand!
Liam: Bigby's Hand? Bigby's Hand!
Sam: I'm going to take damage.
Matt: Yeah. First and foremost, you take four points of slashing damage to your hand. You pull back, and there is a line of blood now, beginning to drip off your hand. You shake it amongst yourself.
Sam: Oh, I can't say "God damn it" in here. I'm in Pelor's-- Sorry, Pelor.
Taliesin: Let's use a sword, I want to see how this plays out.
Sam: God bless you. Gesundheit, Pelor. Man, all right. Well, jeez Louise.
Liam: Whip out the purple hand, man!
Sam: Seems like overkill. What about a Thunderwave? Can I do that?
Matt: Certainly.
Sam: All right. Does it only affect living things? Or does it affect--
Liam: Wait. Scanlan, are there any windows in there?
Sam: There are. There are windows. Good call.
Matt: It's a blast of thunderous energy in an area, it would affect living and nonliving matter, yes.
Liam: Hold on, this is stupid.
Sam: Are you sure?
Taliesin: We are going to the window. We are going to the window.
Sam: No, let's carry this out.
Taliesin: No! We are going to the window. Please do not destroy the temple of Pelor.
Sam: Three hours later, we are still trying to open the door.
Marisha: It's not even locked. It's just heavy.
Sam: I can Bigby's Hand. I'll just Bigby's Hand.
Liam: Which way to the window? I can walk to the window.
Sam: It's up there. You can make it, but Percy can't.
Liam: I can probably lift that door bar from inside.
Sam: You could, probably.
Liam: With your help, son.
Sam: Yeah, but I could blast it. Would be very dramatic.
Liam: Let's save that for important stuff. All right, where is the window? Which way do I go?
Sam: To the right and up.
Matt: There are windows shattered on both sides. They're broken a little higher up. So you could either continue to break the bottom part of the window, or just attempt to leap through the hole.
Liam: Yeah, I'll attempt to leap.
Matt: Okay, so give me an acrobatics check.
Liam: All right.
Sam: The saga of the door!
Marisha: It's just a door, you guys! It's just a door.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. You get a running start, leap off the side and parkour up between the actual-- there is an extension to the side where another room is attached on each side of the temple towards the back. You leap off that wall onto the small pillar that's holding the side of the window and up through the broken portion of the stained glass, landing, three-point landing, on the inside. You almost land in one of the shattered piles of wooden pews and splinters and jagged pieces of wood sticking out of it. About a foot away from you, and you are like, "Oh, that was close." You see Scanlan across the way. You see the altar to your right.
Sam: Hey! Oi! Your stupid idea cut my hand!
Liam: Builds character. I'm going to stay away from the altar and skirt the wall all the way around it. Mat: Okay, you get to the door.
Liam: I'm going to try to help. Do you want to help me lift this thing?
Sam: With my good hand, yes.
Matt: Have both you guys make strength checks.
Sam: You know what, I'm going to get some assistance. I call my Unseen Servant to assist.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Sam: He is going to lift with us.
Matt: With a brief burst of wind energy, a shimmering form, somewhat humanoid in shape, but still amorphous appears.
Sam: Hi, Darrell.
Matt: (wind sounds) and begins to shove itself up against the bottom of the wooden bar. Make your check, as well.
Sam: That was a six. Is that for me?
Matt: That's for you, and then roll and add five for your Unseen Servant.
Sam: So, five extra to that is 11. Right? No?
Matt: Roll again, add five.
Sam: Oh, I see. Four. So that's a nine.
Matt: The three of you, one mystically summoned from a plane beyond your own, cannot seem to budge this single wooden door! You've defeated beholders. You've slaughtered illithid underneath, in the Underdark, deep in the belly of the planet. But this door bests you!
Marisha: Man, Laura and Travis ain't missing shit!
Sam: All right, I'm doing it. Step back!
Liam: Whip out the hand!
Sam: All right, I summon Bigby's Hand! The mightiest hand that will ever unlock a door, ever! (singing) Bigby's Hand!
Matt: This giant, glimmering, purple fist appears in your vicinity. It grabs the bottom. Go ahead and roll a d20.
Liam: Come on.
Sam: 12.
Matt: Plus eight to it.
Sam: Plus eight? 20!
Taliesin: How do you want to do this?
Matt: With its finger, just goes (ping) and it (thudding noises). The door (creak) opens up and Percy stands there, looking not very happy.
Taliesin: Was it overkill? Because really it took that.
Sam: It took three spells to open this door! Three spells!
Taliesin: It's not overkill if you used what it took.
Sam: Three spells and I injured myself.
Taliesin: We took damage from an inanimate object. Oh god! Get it out of our system now!
Sam: Welcome, Percy.
Taliesin: Oh god! All right, I'm looking around, taking in the damage. Anything that I notice is particularly out of whack from the last time I was here? Other than they're upgrading the locks, apparently.
Matt: Looking about the place, it looks pseudo-ransacked. There has been much force used in whatever destroyed these pews. The glass that was broken, was broken from the outside in. So, definitely seems like there was someone throwing a rock through, or a intrusion from an outside standpoint. As you walk further and look around, the two rooms to the side, the doors are closed. There is the altar on the top, and you do see, there is a couple of small sacks, laid to the side of the altar. What looks to be some low-lit candles, and there are some braziers. One to each side of the altar, and one against each wall. All of them appear to be long dark and out. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: All of us?
Matt: All of you.
Sam: 15.
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: You both, as you approach the far side of the temple towards the altar, you notice the brazier to the right is smoldering ever so gently. Just a very faint glow of ember to it.
Liam: What's the matter?
Taliesin: Reynal?
Sam: Who? Reynal?
Taliesin: Father Reynal? (louder) Father Reynal? Let's check one of the doors. We'll start on the door on the right.
Matt: You step up. You can see now, on top of the altar, there appears to be a couple of glass vials that are overturned, a little liquid spilled. You can see bits of broken glass across the bottom, the one step that leads down from the altar's raised platform.
Taliesin: Can I dip and smell?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: 13? Okay. Looking at just the general vicinity of the altar. You taste the liquid. It's definitely somewhat caustic in nature, you can't really determine it. But, just touching it to your tongue, your tongue goes numb for a second and you feel a slight burn. Your nostrils clear out a little bit from the scent. There is some random powders and such that've been brushed off. You get the feeling that the way that all this was treated, it wasn't so much like it was destroyed more than it was hastily packed up. Roll a perception check.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: 20? Okay, looking about the outside of the altar, you do notice that around the brazier that is slightly smoldering there is a layer of ash there, gathered on the inside of the brazier and a little bit on the floor, around its base.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: Someone has been working on something in here.
Sam: It couldn't just be ash from the thing that is burning?
Matt: If you look at the other braziers, there is no ash around it. Most of the ash is contained. The wood ash itself tends to fall; it's a little heavier. This seems to be a lighter shade of ash and it's more of a-- has found its way out of the brazier from just the heat and the air.
Taliesin: I want to smell the ash. Does it smell like some sort of-- is it perfumed?
Matt: You lean down and you take some of the ash in your fingers and smell it. It's not perfumed, but you've had some experience with dealing with various burning materials: this is definitely paper-based ash. You do also notice underneath the brazier there is one sliver of paper that was not wholly burned.
Sam: Paper.
Marisha: (whispering) Paper.
Sam: It's a golden ticket.
Taliesin: "Without sufficient magical essence the distillation is proven to consistently fail. A shame, really. I shall seek an influx of materials elsewhere before I can continue this project. Regarding the weapon, after a year of taking notes from eyewitness accounts, my original designs were faulty and recently cost me my hand. The wind of fortune has seen a shift it seems as Sylas just returned from Emon, having encountered the still-living subject, and had the pleasure of seeing his work first-hand. His unnatural eyes took in much detail. I believe his observations have brought me to the brink of finishing my design. I intend to journey from Whitestone within a couple of months to gather the components needed. But, if Delilah's hunch is correct, the subject is heading here. I may find myself needing to leave sooner than anticipated."
Liam: They're trying to copy your work.
Sam: Copy?
Taliesin: Why?
Liam: For war.
Taliesin: I want to take another look at everything that was on the altar, and I want to see if it looks--
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: Testing what's there  I mean, a lot of the material has been scattered and mixed but there are elements that resemble the black powder you've used in some of your constructs and tinkering in the past.
Sam: They're making guns!
Taliesin: Well, we know we're looking for someone without a hand.
Sam: To do what?
Taliesin: To find out who's trying to copy my work.
Sam: Someone who is working with Sylas, right?
Taliesin: Yes. Let's check the rest of the temple.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to go up on the altar. Was there a small something on the altar?
Matt: What you noticed were like some of the glass vials that were overturned.
Taliesin: What's in the pouches?
Matt: Looking at the pouches, it looks like some of them contained phosphorus, some of them contained other alchemical reagents that were used in the research but most have been emptied, and it's just a residuum on the inside.
Taliesin: Checking the door on the right.
Matt: Door on the right.
Liam: Going with.
Matt: (creak) Opens up into what was Father Reynal's room. As the door opens, you're immediately hit with terrible smell of decay. And you can see, shoved under the bed that first appears on the opposite side of the small room, what appears to be the remains of Father Reynal. Long passed and left to fester beneath his bed.
Sam: Can I tell how he died?
Matt: You're welcome to go ahead and take a look. Roll an investigation check.
Sam: 23.
Matt: 23. Looking at the body, it appears that there are a series of puncture wounds. Rapier-based. They're too long, like stiletto, too long to be a dagger.
Sam: Not teeth.
Matt: No, they are inflicted by a weapon, a long thin weapon. And multiple to the torso.
Taliesin: I'm going to search the room for anything else. Search the body.
Matt: Okay. Searching the body, searching the room, it looks like everything of interest has been taken from the place. You find some leftover stale food, you find some candles that are generally used for the purposes of worship here in the temple, but anything beyond that-- all the drawers have been emptied, everything has been taken by whoever was previously setting up residence in this facility.
Sam: Are there any holy symbols or anything that we might take to give to Keyleth to, I don't know. Wasn't she gonna-- I don't know. Do some holy shit?
Matt: You do notice that, throughout the temple, there are images of Pelor, flame-wreathed face, various sun and stars that are set up, but most of them have been profaned, marked on, shattered, or covered in soot. An intentional effort has been made to dampen the power of Pelor in this once-holy place.
Liam: Are there any untouched?
Matt: None that are untouched, but there are some that could possibly be cleaned. A couple of small medallions that are hanging up in the room where the Father lays.
Liam: I'll snag those.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I want to check the other room. The room to the left.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: So much perception. 19.
Sam: 19.
Liam: 20.
Matt: All right. As you walk back into the main temple--
Marisha: Finish. First.
Matt: All right. Your ears catch a faint, distant sound like a strong wind pushing through a mountain pass. This low mournful wail-type sound.
Sam: What's that?
Matt: No wind is moving. There is a stillness to the air.
Liam: Stepping back into the darkest shadows I can see.
Matt: As you guys take in this sense, this sound gets louder and louder. At which point, the air itself gets colder and colder. As you nervously exhale, you can see your breath becoming visible in the air around you. As you all look at each other, you, stepping back into what shadows there are, as it is a very open temple, as it's a temple of sun--
Liam: 32 stealth.
Matt: You find what tiny little alcove you can of shadow. It's not going to offer a lot of protection once you move, but for now you seem to be out of the circumstance.
Sam: I grab Percy, and I make us both go invisible.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: So, what is that, a 3rd-level Invisibility spell?
Matt: Yeah. You guys both vanish, holding your place on top of the altar, and as that moaning tends to grow louder and louder you can see this shimmer at the doors that are open on the opposite side of the room. It looks like a woman. A form of a woman, but translucent in nature, drifting in, giving off the horrible (raspy groan) sound, as it drifts in and you see it looking around and the features are gaunt as it gets closer. It looks elven by racial nature, but the eyes are just these sunken faintly glowing sockets, the hair wild and matted and floating behind it, its hands reaching out, and as it gets partway through the temple, it looks like it's seeking something, and its eyes fall directly on you two.
Liam: I'm throwing a dagger right now.
Matt: Let's go ahead and--
Sam: Ugh! What if she was a good guy?
Liam: It's a banshee, man.
Sam: What if it's a good banshee? Some of the banshees that I've met have been decent. We're rolling for initiative?
Liam: There's Siouxsie and the Banshees, they're all right.
Sam: I'm glad I used half my spells trying to get into this goddamn place.
Matt: Off to the side there.
Liam: He means well.
Taliesin: He means well. That's a terrible costume.
Matt: You guys are on the altar there.
Taliesin: You were so prepared for me to go to the temple that you built it?
Matt: I built the whole city, because I didn't know where you guys were going to go.
Sam: Jesus, Matt!
Marisha: He does have a pile of maps over there. MATT Shh! Don't look at it.
Taliesin: I'm not looking, I'm not looking.
Marisha: I'm just noting the pile.
Matt: So, first and foremost, let's go ahead and roll initiative.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: You'll get a surprise round.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: Dope.
Liam: Natural 20 for initiative, as well.
Marisha: You finally got a good initiative roll!
Sam: I got a seven.
Taliesin: I got an 11! Together, we can get a Slurpee. I'm weird tonight. I don't know what's up.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Well, I can't do anything.
Matt: All right, well. First and foremost, before anything happens, this entity, as it notices your presence, it begins to transform and its image becomes more horrifying. As you pull your dagger out, I need all of you guys to roll a wisdom saving throw.
Marisha: You have advantage!
Taliesin: I rolled a one and then a natural 20.
Matt: (laughs) Nice.
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17?
Taliesin: Thank you for the advantage.
Marisha: You're welcome.
Matt: Scanlan?
Sam: 11.
Matt: With advantage?
Sam: I also always have advantage, so do I get to roll a third time?
Liam: No. Doesn't stack.
Matt: Unfortunately you are considered frightened by this entity. It scares the crap out of you.
Marisha: You can't be frightened after a Heroes' Feast.
Taliesin: You can't be frightened after a Heroes' Feast.
Matt: Ah! Then never mind. You feel it shake your form for a second. Its horrible visual presence, for a second, freaks you out, but then you remember the knowledge that your friends are here and you have to serve a purpose and you shake off--
Sam: Not only do I shake it off, I gird my loins!
Matt: Pull them up and get ready. All right.
Marisha: Just for a refresher  you're immune to poison, disease, and fear, and you have advantage on your wisdom throws.
Taliesin: We should do this every time we fly.
Marisha: It's expensive.
Liam: So, do I get to attack and then move into the combat round where I got a natural 20 plus five for initiative?
Matt: Well, you go first. Technically, it's not a surprise round because the creature can sense life and saw them before it happens, so it wasn't ambushed. But you do get to go first, and you do get to go before it. In the use of surprise, I didn't mean to use it in the surprise round fashion. These entities can detect living creatures up to five miles away.
Liam: So, there's no sneak attack damage on this thing, is there?
Matt: If you get to it first, you still have advantage.
Liam: All right.
Matt: Because it doesn't see you. You're still hidden from it.
Liam: 15, so this is a 26 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. And this gets the sneak attack damage?
Matt: This would, yes.
Liam: All right, here we go. But it's not a critical hit from assassinate because--
Matt: It is not surprised.
Liam: It's not surprised. All right. So, that's a four plus seven is 11. Plus 15, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28?
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm just going to keen dagger it three times in a row. Oh, I've got to roll to attack, so that is a twelve plus-- 22?
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Okay. Two, and that is six of damage, and then natural 20 on that one. That is three, four, three, plus seven is ten, so 20 for that, if it's doubled for a critical hit.
Matt: For double dice, not doubled modifier.
Liam: Oh, all right, so six plus-- 13.
Matt: Okay, 13, good to know. Awesome. So, out of the shadows, (whoosh) three daggers strike this wailing ghost entity. Each dagger, it punctures, and you see it reacts from the impact as there's a flash of magical energy with each hit. The daggers then tumble out of its form and then blink back to your belt side. It looks like it definitely did some damage to it, but it's--
Liam: You know what, just to be fair, I changed out all my daggers except for one, so I probably couldn't throw the same dagger three times in a row, so I think should pull back some of the modifiers, so I would pull out four, because my dagger is plus two. So the plus two for two of those hits gets taken out, right?
Matt: It would actually, yes.
Liam: So four, minus four.
Matt: So, minus four damage to this other guy.
Taliesin: So truthful.
Sam: So, we're fighting it with wooden stakes?
Matt: Wait so you threw wooden stakes at it as two of the attacks?
Liam: I threw one dagger and two wooden stakes.
Matt: Okay. So, the first dagger hits?
Liam: First was the dagger, yeah.
Matt: Yeah. The two other stakes pass through its form without any other impact. The one dagger does return to you, but the two stakes just clatter in the distance, and the creature seems unharmed by those two.
Liam: Even though they came out of the belt?
Matt: Yeah!
Liam: All right.
Matt: Sorry.
Liam: It's okay. It's just wood.
Taliesin: You learned.
Matt: So that ends that point. The creature now swoops up to the center of you three and gives out this horrible (roar) this wailing scream that bursts out in the air, you feel like the wind push you back and all of you feel like for a moment you're staring at your own death. I need all three of you guys to roll constitution saving throws.
Sam: Does our meal help us with that at all?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: 11.
Marisha: Wait, don't forget you have the additional--
Liam: What?
Marisha: 2d10 hit points on top.
Sam: Okay. 16.
Liam: 16.
Matt: Okay. Both of you guys, you feel this chilling burst of spiritual energy blast through your soul. And you each take 14 points of psychic damage. Percy, however, as you look at it, it seems like this blast actually forces the soul from your body momentarily. You immediately drop to zero hit points and are unconscious.
Sam: What? No! No, he can't. Oh, god.
Matt: So with that, you see Percy, eyes roll back and then collapse onto the floor like a pile of cold bones. Out. Percy, it's your turn. Go ahead and make a death saving throw.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: 11, okay.
Marisha: That's a good sign.
Matt: Scanlan, it's your turn.
Sam: Very quickly. Should we flee?
Marisha: Get the fuck out.
Liam: In a little bit.
Sam: In a little bit? Okay.
Liam: Without Percy?
Marisha: Well, get him up.
Matt: You still have Bigby's Hand, by the way, on concentration.
Sam: Oh, that's right!
Matt: Let's see how long that lasts, actually. Let me see how long it lasts. Just to be safe.
Taliesin: We haven't been there very long. (whispering) God damn it.
Matt: Up to a minute. So probably would have faded by now.
Sam: God damn it.
Matt: Sorry. What are you doing, Scanlan?
Taliesin: Really, it's the door's fault.
Sam: Shit. I'll just Lightning Bolt her. Him. It. Whatever it is.
Matt: Okay. So you release a bolt of lightning energy right in its direction. Go ahead and roll damage for that.
Sam: Oh, just damage?
Matt: You don't have to hit for lightning bolt; it just hits everything in front of it, and you have to try and avoid it.
Sam: Oh, 8d6.
Matt: What's the DC?
Sam: Do I get my hand cone?
Matt: It is a free action to pull it out, so you instinctively-- hand cone, cast the spell-- out the bolt goes.
Sam: So, 19.
Matt: 19, okay.
Sam: 8d6.
Matt: Does not make its saving throw.
Sam: Great.
Taliesin: Need more d6, or are you cool?
Sam: Nope, that's it. I just need help counting.
Marisha: That's good!
Sam: 16, five, 21, 27.
Taliesin: 28, 29, 30. 34!
Sam: 34.
Matt: 34 points of damage. The lightning blasts through her, not impactful as you think it might be. This entity because it is in an ethereal state, is not as effectively hit by such magics. However, it does take damage.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I will move back a bit. Away from the thing. And I will-- Oh! We have people.
Marisha: Yay! Percy's unconscious!
Laura: No!
Travis: Keep fighting!
Marisha: It's okay, it's cool.
Laura: We've been listening in the car.
Taliesin: Okay, so you know.
Matt: Scanlan, you move back?
Sam: Okay, and then I can, as a bonus action, still get a bonus? I will heal him, this doofus here.
Taliesin: I didn't do anything!
Matt: Healing Word.
Sam: Okay, yeah. (singing) I'm bring health points back. Yeah! You mothafuckas don't know how to act-- Yeah! That's all I got. (singing) Take it to the bridge!
Matt: All right, so Healing Word is 1d4 plus--
Sam: Yeah, but maybe I should do it at a--
Taliesin: Just get me up. It's okay.
Sam: Just get you up? Okay. 1d4 plus something?
Marisha: Do it.
Sam: Two plus whatever. Six? Eight?
Marisha: I think it's plus your spell level.
Matt: Healing Word will be--
Sam: It's 1d4 plus five, so it's seven points.
Matt: So, seven hit points. You're conscious, but you're still on the ground, face down, loosely fallen over the stuff on the altar.
Taliesin: I don't get my turn until next round.
Matt: Correct. So, Scanlan? Your turn's done? Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, so where is it? I'm just going to back away from it about three steps, while I pull Flametongue Dagger out of my cloak.
Matt: Okay. You're in this room currently.
Liam: Yeah, oh! That, oh, okay. No. So, I'm going to walk, thanks. I'm going to slide up the wall along where Scanlan is. Towards Scanlan. And another thing I realized, I haven't clicked my Boots of Haste, so I wouldn't have been able to do whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, anyway. And I'm still not going to. But I'm pulling out my Flametongue Dagger and now I'm throwing Keen Dagger, Flametongue. First one is 26.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: And the second one is 23.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Okay. First attack gets 11.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And the second attack gets eight.
Matt: All righty. Both daggers hitting it, you see its form being impacted by each dagger hit. It still continues to come forward toward the two of you. Is that the end of your movement?
Liam: I'm going to, without doing any dash or anything, because I can't, I'm going to move as far as I can just going kitty-corner. Behind Scanlan, walking along the wall.
Matt: Over here?
Liam: Absolutely.
Matt: That far?
Liam: Yeah, that's as far as I can get, that's good.
Matt: I think so. All right. That ends your turn. The creature now is going to drift up to the unconscious form, or the now-conscious form of Percy. It's going to swipe at you with its Corrupting Touch. Since you're prone, it has advantage on the attack. That'll be 20 to hit. What's your AC?
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. As its hand reaches down and passes through, as you just come to consciousness, and you start getting yourself up, you look up and feel this cold sensation as its hand reaches through your back and seems to almost grasp your spine. Your whole body lurches from the impact. You take 12 points of necrotic damage.
Taliesin: I'm back to zero.
Sam: That's two!
Liam: It starts over.
Sam: It does?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm back to zero.
Sam: If he dies once, comes back and dies again, is that two?
Matt: No, he has to fail his death saves.
Taliesin: I just woke up and went, (groans). Passed back out again.
Matt: That ends its turn. Well, no actually, it's going to start moving now. It's going to drift through the rest of its movement this direction. That ends its turn. Go ahead and make your death saving throw.
Taliesin: Yes, 19.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Yay, little snitch.
Matt: All righty. That ends your turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Hey, should we leave?
Liam: No, we should kill this thing!
Sam: Damn it! All right.
Liam: We're not going to be able to run. This thing flew in here on the breeze.
Sam: I don't think Eyebite's going to work against it. So, fuck, I'll cast Bigby's Hand at 6th-level, then.
Matt: (laughing) Okay!
Travis: Has that ever been done?
Sam: I don't have any more 5th-level slots. So, I'm just going to make it even bigger.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: I don't even know what it does.
Liam: Fingers going out the windows of the church like Alice in Wonderland.
Matt: All right. Bigby's Hand. With a clenched fist deals an additional 2d8 damage.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: So if you're going to punch it, it does an additional 2d8 damage.
Sam: Yes, I think--
Matt: What are you going to do?
Sam: I'm going to bitch-slap it, but the forceful hand. So I can just push it far away from us. Possibly to the front door.
Matt: Okay, I see. So it does no damage but it does force its movement.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, and I'll say because you did it at a higher level, it's an additional five feet of movement on that. So, as the hand shoves toward the creature--
Sam: It takes no damage for that?
Matt: The forceful hand it doesn't, no. There's grasping hand and the clenched fist do damage.
Sam: All right, so then I'll just hit it. I'll just hit it hard.
Matt: Okay. So, you bitch-slap it physically hard. Clenched fist. Go ahead and make a spell attack. Go ahead and roll a d20, add your spell attack modifier.
Sam: 14. Plus, what am I adding? Oh, nine. Plus nine.
Matt: 14 plus nine? That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. That's 6d8 force damage because you cast it at 6th level.
Sam: 6d8. I don't even know what those are. That's a ten.
Liam: They look like diamonds.
Sam: There they go. I got one. I'll just roll it six times.
Travis: (singing) Diamonds are Scanlan's best friend.
Laura: No, diamonds are Vex's best friend.
Sam: 24?
Matt: 24.
Sam: Even at 6th-level, that's all it did.
Matt: Yeah. As that happens, the fist clenches and (wham) bitch-slaps the back of the wailing ghost creature. As it does you hear it scream out in pain (screech) as its spectral form is scattered across the air and dissipates.
Sam: What?
Marisha: Thank god.
Sam: What?
Travis: I think you smashed it.
Marisha: You killed it.
Liam: You crushed it.
Sam: But I'm so little and wee!
Liam: Lift yourself up for a victory lap.
Sam: Yes, I lift myself up with Bigby's Hand. Yeah, that was a great idea.
Matt: You toss yourself up a couple times.
Sam: Whoa!
Travis: Meanwhile, Percy's unconscious.
Sam: Oh shit! Percy!
Liam: No, I've got four healing potions. I pour, it's not the best. It's a greater healing?
Matt: So, it's 4d4 plus four.
Sam: I will also sing for him a Song of Rest, which is just another d6.
Matt: If you guys are taking a short rest--
Sam: Yeah. Oh, are we clear of danger?
Liam: We don't know, but I poured the potion into Percy's mouth.
Taliesin: 4d4 plus four?
Matt: Yep, you got it.
Taliesin: Four, five, six, seven, nine, ten, 14. Yep. I'm awake. Hurt, but--
Liam: I slap him twice, anyway.
Taliesin: Ugh! Ah!
Liam: What do we do?
Sam: What are we doing here?
Liam: The priest's dead. Is there anyone else, or should we head back?
Taliesin: We should head back. Apparently, any help I thought we'd find here is obviously gone.
Sam: Should we check this other room first, before we go?
Taliesin: Did we not check the other room?
Sam: No.
Liam: No.
Taliesin: Let's check the other room, and--
Sam: Quickly, though, quickly.
Taliesin: We'll check the other room quickly.
Liam: While they check the room, I'm going to go all over the altar and see if there's anything, any hidden door, any trapdoor, anything like that.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: Eh. That's a-- oh! No! Wait, I keep forgetting that's a rogue skill. That's a 20.
Taliesin: I was really hoping you missed that part.
Matt: Looking over the altar, it appears to be smooth, solid stone. Nothing catches your attention. You check the other room. This is a small kitchen, essentially, for whoever was running here would make small meals or things to delineate during worship and/or just cook for its own meals when the father was keeping--
Taliesin: Has it been used recently? Is it--
Matt: It does not appear to have been used, you can make an investigation check to gather an idea of how long it's been there. SAM I'm going to look around as well and food and stuff.
Taliesin: 12.
Sam: 22.
Matt: Okay. You get the feeling that the last time this was used was a little under a week ago.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: Any provisions that we can take? Water, food?
Matt: You find a couple of loaves of stale bread, some dried meats, salted dry meats, like some jerky-ish type things. Things that are meant to last a while. There is produce here, but the produce has long wilted and gone to rot.
Taliesin: I have theories on who's been using this space. Is there anything that would clue me in to who's been using this space?
Matt: It's hard to really tell. You're not too familiar with lifestyles of different individuals. Whoever left the notes, and whoever was dabbling with the vicinity does have a tendency towards sciences and alchemy in ways that seemingly can blend and overlap with your specialty. That's the best you can ascertain, based on the information given.
Taliesin: Now, here's the question. Do we leave them a sign that we're here, or do we hope that they don't notice?
Sam: Well, let's leave them a sign. We're supposed to be sowing discontent, right? So, let's leave a sign that someone was here and fucked up their shit. Do you want me to pee on the altar?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: I take my dagger, and I go to the altar--
Taliesin: Wait.
Sam: No, don't leave your dagger; it's your only one left.
Liam: I didn't say I'm leaving it. Yeah. You want that?
Taliesin: I want that.
Liam: I start-- would you hand me that scrap of paper, yeah?
Sam: Whoa, this is our sign?
Liam: So I start carving this-- Is this Pelor?
Taliesin: This is not Pelor. It's part of the crest of de Rolo.
Laura: Ooh!
Marisha: de Rolos are back!
Liam: Okay. So, I just start scraping it into the stone with the Keen Dagger.
Matt: Okay. And it gives a horrible screeching sound as you carve into this well-polished stone surface that's used predominantly for worship, or when it was. Given about five, ten minutes in you manage to scrape a design into it that is visually distinct against the smooth surface, and does match the design best to your ability that Percy--
Taliesin: I would also like to drag Father Reynal out of his room and put him at the pedestal.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And then before we go, I'm going to the wooden door, and I carve into the door: Pelor lives in Whitestone.
Sam: That's a lot of words.
Marisha: Six hours later...
Liam: It's wood! It took me five minutes.
Matt: Okay. You finish your carving, seemingly without recurring incident.
Taliesin: Like to head back now, I believe.
Matt: Yeah. You guys make your way out of the temple back into the center of the graveyard. The sun is beginning to set. The reds and purples of the night sky are starting to creep in, as it just begins to crest on the far western side of the mountain range surrounding the valley.
Marisha: I have a question. MATT Yes.
Marisha: What's the weather been like since we've been in Whitestone?
Matt: It's been spotty, cloudy--
Marisha: The sun has come out during the daytime?
Matt: Bits and pieces. There is heavy cloud cover that seems to be pushing through. It brings colder weather. It looks like when you first got there, there was some snowfall that happened before you arrived. You've had a few days of sun, but I'd say about half the day is cloud cover.
Marisha: Does it seem to be fairly natural weather for this time of year? Okay.
Matt: And this far north, too. All right. You guys--
Liam: I also grab those wooden stakes off the ground.
Matt: Okay. Takes you a little time, because they're amongst a bunch of other broken wooden scraps--
Liam: I grab a couple extra, as well.
Matt: Okay! You find some splintered wood. You guys make your way back into the town. I'd like you all to make a stealth, or a deception check, if you prefer.
Sam: Deception, please. (sings a ditty) I'm just a peasant boy.
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: 13.
Travis: G'day sir.
Liam: 23.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: 32.
Matt: All right. As you guys are making your way back towards the tavern, there is a small group of Whitestone villagers walking and having a conversation. Not heated, but there is a sense of desperate conversation amongst them. And, standing with them you can see there's an older gentleman, mostly bald, long scraggly gray hair that falls past his shoulders, a little bit hunched. He's wearing dark leathers and a cloak that's over one shoulder and drags the ground behind him. And they're talking to him and he's growling to himself and the best you can make out is there's an argument about farming shipments and the inability to make dates and requirements. He shouts back to the remainder, says, "Listen, it is beyond my control. This is what has been decreed by Sir Kerrion. That is how it'll be. If you cannot provide, then taxes will be pulled. If you cannot pay, then there are far worse things we can take. Now, be on your way!" And steps away from the group, looks over and sees a little boy and this in the shadows skulking individual. "You there!"
Taliesin: Yes?
Matt: "You new around here?"
Taliesin: A bit, yes.
Matt: "I don't recognize you." And two of the guards step forward.
Taliesin: I suppose it's our good luck, then.
Matt: "What's your name?"
Taliesin: (sighs) Reggie.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Taliesin: Fuck my life. I know! 21!
Liam: My name's Reggie.
Matt: "Then make yourself useful. Maybe you can make up for some of these lost crops that these bags of shite keep saying they can't do."
Taliesin: I'm actually supposed to be going back for a--
Matt: "I don't give a shit, move on, boy."
Taliesin: Yes, sir.
Matt: He grumbles and keeps on walking. The guards give you a look. One of them spits at your foot, keeps walking on. Eventually, they drift aside. You continue your path back to the tavern where the rest of you are waiting. The sun has now set. Night has taken the sky and Keyleth is on the verge of completing her ritual.
Laura: I'm cleaning my nails as I'm watching her.
Taliesin: I'm keeping an eye from the second floor. I want to see how much movement in the city there is and whether or not there's any guards by the tree, whether or not the tree seems to be left to its own devices.
Matt: Okay. As you're keeping watch, you notice occasionally there will be one of the zombie giants that will lumber through the center of town. There's a very specific pattern that they tend to follow.
Taliesin: Definitely trying to memorize that.
Matt: And you do notice a couple of other guards that you didn't notice during the day begin to show up. They're humanoid; they're armored. They sneak around. They're humanoid, but their movement is unnatural.
Taliesin: Is there a lot of light in the town, or not very much light?
Matt: Not very much light at all. There's very low-lit points at certain crossroads that've been left up for general visibility for those who have to travel at night, but you gather most people just do not travel at night here in Whitestone.
Laura: Make sure no lights are lit in our--
Taliesin: We've already blacked out--
Sam: I blacked out the windows.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Keyleth--
Marisha: Yeah?
Matt: You finally complete your ritual. Sweat pouring down your brow, you have your hand on the roots--
Marisha: Can I do something? Something real quick for my final, extra drama? So, as I complete the ritual, remembering that Pelor, and this is a sun tree. I'm going to cast my 6th-level Sunbeam spell as I'm finishing the Plant Growth with the last big essence--
Sam: At night?
Marisha: I'm underground. So, I'm going to take my Sunbeam, and wrap it up with my druid goodness. And shove it in the tree.
Taliesin: You're going to shove it where the sun don't shine.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to kill it. I don't know if it's going to work or not.
Matt: Okay. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: Do I get advantage on this? Because of Heroes' Feast?
Matt: I would say no, because this isn't a saving throw and because what you're attempting to do is essentially convert a highly damaging spell into a non-damaging circumstance at the end of an eight-hour endurance match with a ritual. This is going to be a difficult attempt. So go ahead and roll a d20. Add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: I hope I didn't just fuck up by doing this.
Laura: You got it, Keyleth.
Travis: Yeah, you never get arrested or anything, you're good.
Sam: Use the green one. This is you doing greenery.
Marisha: I'm so nervous.
Sam: Natural 20. Easy. Or a six.
Laura: Oh, no.
Marisha: But my wisdom's not bad, so 12?
Matt: You complete the ritual and release the healing energy of your Plant Growth spell. As you release it you begin to concentrate on the sun ray and you begin to see, throughout the pieces of earth around, seeds quickly begin to germinate and small little bits of ivy, greenery begin to pierce out from parts of the earth in your immediate vicinity, as this affects a large radius. There does not appear to be any sort of immediate reaction by the tree. You begin to pull back and concentrate on the spell. You release the Sunbeam forward. In the frustration of the lack of reaction from the tree and the desperation to make sure some effect happens, you release the full force of the beam as opposed to the prequel aspect and you burst into some of the roots, blasting some of them apart and beginning to set flame to part of the under of the tree.
Marisha: Oh, cool. That's cool. Cool story.
Liam: Bucket of water.
Marisha: I'll put it out.
Matt: You guys hear this (explosion).
Laura: That's right in front of-- I pull out my cloaks in my bag and start trying to put out the flames. Keyleth, what? Was that supposed to happen? Is that good? Was this good? Should I stop? I keep putting out the flames.
Matt: You put out the flames. And you notice where the fire had burned aspects of the wood, there is the black char marks across the roots where the flames touched, and the area surrounding the root is a little more of a vibrant brown color. Almost like a little hint of life seemed to have seeped into the root.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Matt: It expands for a moment and you can see a little bit of life return to that localized section of the tree.
Marisha: Ooh! Like starting a fire. (blows air) Go, go! Can I Druidcraft? Come on!
Matt: As you do, there's still these bits of ivy greenery, this long-embedded seeds through years and years and generations of earth layering in here. These long-dormant seeds are starting to come to life and spring through the earth around you. The expansion of the healthier portion of the root begins to spread, and then stop spreading. And you begin to notice all the greenery begins to immediately wither and crumple and turn to ash. And you watch as the vibrant aspect of the roots slowly drain from the bottom up. Like something is pulling the life force out of the roots.
Laura: They're sucking the life force out of the earth.
Marisha: I take some of that holy oil that Vax gave me and I dip my finger in it and start rubbing it along the vines that are growing along the edge of the roots.
Matt: You take the holy oil and place it along the roots, and it soaks into the dry and in some cases now charred aspects of the roots. You wait a moment, and the oil seems to almost burn off and evaporate.
Sam: So, the ground is cursed.
Marisha: The ground is cursed.
Sam: Well, poo.
Travis: Should I try peeing on it?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: Perception check?
Taliesin: That thing you hate doing?
Marisha: No, I'm good at perceiving things, I'm just not good at reading people.
Sam: You know what we need to do?
Marisha: That's not bad. 23?
Sam: Hydroponics. No ground, just grow it above.
Matt: The pattern of decay that followed your initial attempt at reviving this vicinity, all had a very distinct downward motion of draining. There was something about the ground, something beneath the tree and where you are that is seemingly taking the life force of the surroundings.
Laura: Oh, my god, what if the vampire thing is right underneath us?
Marisha: I was going to say, can I still see the green being sucked down a bit?
Matt: At this point, all the life force was very quickly drained.
Laura: Can I use my Primeval Awareness and sense any sort of vampiric presence within our very close vicinity?
Matt: What's the radius on that?
Laura: It's a minute. It's up to six miles if I spend six minutes.
Matt: Okay. So you take your time, and you begin to focus and it expands. As you do, focusing on vampiric presence, you feel a fair amount of presence: above, below and further north. And smattered throughout the city. You get the sensation at this point in time that there is much more beyond just Lord Briarwood that have come to be a creature of the night in this city.
Laura: (whispering) That's good. Bad. Probably bad.
Travis: Maybe they're not below the tree, maybe it's just the soil.
Taliesin: The ground is tainted.
Marisha: I'm exhausted.
Sam: Let's sleep.
Taliesin: Let's sleep.
Laura: We're just going to sleep? Surrounded by vampires, we're just going to sleep surrounded by lots and lots of vampires?
Taliesin: I'm going to tinker for a moment on my glove with that thing I talked about.
Matt: Okay. Make an intelligence check.
Taliesin: An intelligence check?
Matt: Yeah, just a straight intelligence check.
Taliesin: 14.
Matt: 14. Incorporating this organic organ? Keeping it from rotting is already going to be a feat. In order to incorporate any of its natural charge essence is going to require your workshop. Doing that on the go is too intricate.
Taliesin: I just wanted to think about it. It's fine.
Matt: I mean, it may be functional. It's definitely possible to use what you extracted from the behir to be a way to charge your Diplomacy, but that is something that you'll have to do in a controlled space when you have everything at your disposal. It's a very delicate process to even attempt it.
Taliesin: I think we get it.
Liam: I'll take first watch.
Matt: Okay. You all take an evening's rest.
Marisha: I'm sorry I couldn't fix the tree, you guys.
Taliesin: We learned a lot.
Laura: You even did that awesome fire thing at the end that was really, really cool.
Marisha: Thanks. I was afraid I was going to permanently kill it for a second.
Taliesin: We know it's not dead dead. That it's just tainted.
Sam: Guys, I just want to say that I killed a door and a banshee, so--
Laura: Really?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: Nice, Scanlan.
Sam: The door was harder to kill.
Travis: That's some door!
Taliesin: It's okay. I think I figured out what we have to do first.
Marisha: What do we have to do first?
Taliesin: I think we have to kill Kerrion Stonefell.
Sam: Who's that?
Taliesin: It's the one that everyone-- he's the one managing all of the goods and all of the farming.
Sam: Is that who they were talking about today? The group?
Laura: Where is he at?
Sam: Oh, Sir Kerrion. I thought they said something else.
Taliesin: Kerrion Stonefell. He's in one of the three-- I would assume that he's been given one of the three mansions in town.
Sam: You think if we find him, kill him, and leave his body on some sort of public display, it would sow some seeds of rebellion?
Taliesin: I think it would be the beginning. He's who everybody's afraid of.
Travis: We could hang him in the tree.
Taliesin: We could hang him in the tree.
Sam: We could. Grog, could you do something nasty to his body?
Travis: Just say the word.
Laura: Oh, this is messed up.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Do we check the mansions for him?
Taliesin: I think we ask around to see if there's a way to ask around to find out who's in what house.
Sam: Ask around? Let's just go house to house and kill everyone in all of them!
Taliesin: Let's-- Eventually, yes.
Travis: Hello. I'd like to share the news of our Lord and Savior: my axe in your face!
Sam: Yes. We could be Mormons.
Matt: As you guys take your watches and go to sleep in the cold interior, and it is a cold interior of the tavern. As the night comes through, this is your first time really staying the night in the center of Whitestone. Even though you slept in the forest, in the boughs of the trees itself, the temperature grows far colder here, and even with the warm interior, the windows frost over and you find yourselves having to huddle or build some sort of small fire to even keep a semblance of comfort to rest. You all eventually go to sleep throughout your various times. I would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw. With advantage, because you're still affected by the Heroes' Feast.
Sam: Until noon tomorrow, right?
Marisha: 2PM tomorrow.
Sam: Yeah!
Taliesin: 12.
Sam: 17.
Marisha: 25.
Liam: 20.
Laura: 23.
Travis: 14.
Matt: Okay. All of you wake the next morning rested as best as can be. Percy, your entire evening was wracked with nightmare after nightmare, imagery you wish to not recall. Whispers and voices familiar, unfamiliar, seeing yourself pulled from your physical self into the heart of this banshee, then wrest from death, barely, cackling in the distance. I want you to go ahead and mark on your sheet one point of corruption.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: What does that mean?
Marisha: Oh no!
Sam: I don't even know where that is on the sheet!
Laura: He could be evil. We could turn evil here!
Matt: As you wake up, you find yourself wracked by those nightmares, a sense of nervousness comes to you. And there's a tremor to your voice now that's uncontrollable. At times of silence, you find yourself impulsively clearing your throat. And with that we're going to take a five-minute break.
Marisha: What the fuck?!
Taliesin: Yay!
Matt: All right guys, keep this to a stringent five-minute break so we can get to as much as we can before the show's up tonight. So we'll see you guys here in five minutes? All right?
Liam: See you in 17. [break]
Matt: Welcome back everyone. So, a couple quick things. One, we're roughly 30 to 25 subs away from our next milestone. The milestone, as we do with every 100 subs, the winner in the chat room, as long as you're active in it, gets a package of one of our signed cast photos, as well as a wonderful poster art piece from our artist, Kit Buss, signed by the cast, and that will also be our 10k mark.
Travis: Damn!
Liam: Damn, damn!
Travis: Skittles, motherfucker!
Matt: It's pretty fantastic. So, as soon as we hit that we'll have our next giveaway and a big celebration as we hit 10k.
Marisha: Get yourself a double cheeseburger.
Liam: (singing) Look at the Sun Tree!
Matt: Also, you guys just caught, as that break ended, a quick episode of Omnibus. Omnibus is a new show that shows here every Tuesday. It's helmed by Ian and Hector, some of our fantastic hosts here. It talks about all sorts of things. Not just Batman things. All sorts of things in geek culture and-- what's that?
Taliesin: There's more than Batman?
Matt: There's more than Batman! It's crazy! I pop up there every now and then to answer some questions and talk about some cool things, as well as a number of other cool personalities that pop in and out. Check it out if you're around on Tuesday. It's a lot of fun. All righty. So let's kick back into this. So, a rough morning's rest come to fruition. Percy seems a little worse for wear after the evening's sleep.
Marisha: You feeling okay?
Taliesin: (grunts)
Marisha: It was cold. Did you catch a cold?
Taliesin: No, I'm fine.
Marisha: Is your throat ticklish?
Taliesin: A little ticklish, I'm fine.
Marisha: Do you want some Goodberries? It might help a little bit--
Laura: Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: I'll take some Goodberries.
Marisha: All right. If you suck on them a little bit they act like "logenzes."
Sam: "Logenzes?"
Marisha: Well, shut up.
Liam: Kenny Logenzes.
Sam: Kenny Logenzes.
Marisha: Kenny Logenzes.
Matt: It's a whole business opportunity that was missed.
Laura: Oh wait. Seeming has ended at this point, hasn't it?
Matt: Seeming has ended, yes.
Laura: So, Trinket is a bear.
Matt: Trinket is now a bear.
Laura: Okay, cool.
Matt: And not a donkey.
Travis: And not a donkey.
Liam: But he's indoors with us, right?
Laura: Yeah. I've been laying on him all night.
Travis: Man, that was a good night's sleep. Who do we get to kill today?
Sam: Sir Kerrion.
Travis: How many mansions are there?
Taliesin: There's three.
Travis: Right. One, three.
Liam: Do you know which one he lives in?
Taliesin: I don't.
Liam: Shit.
Sam: Only one way to find out. Burn every house down except for those three mansions and see who runs out.
Travis: I like it. Seconded.
Taliesin: I also think perhaps we should find a new place to sleep tonight. I think it might be best. To mix it up. Keep moving.
Travis: But I've been peeing in the corner.
Laura: That's why it smells like it does. Grog!
Travis: What? Look, it's like they did in the old days, they had chamberpots. I mean, I have my corner. It's my recreation corner. Sorry. Yeah, that's my brand.
Liam: That is ripe. We're leaving.
Sam: You want to all be peasants again? Can we not just disguise ourselves in tattered clothes?
Laura: I have a bear. Do you want to disguise the bear?
Sam: Oh, wait. We could just leave the bear behind.
Laura: In the house.
Sam: He could guard this safe house, and then we could go find another safe house.
Taliesin: Scanlan, cast the spell.
Sam: All right, fine. Seeming it is. We're all peasants and he's a donkey. And I'm a little boy.
Matt: You're a little boy. Jovial boy without a yo-yo.
Taliesin: There's a shop that I used to frequent. We can see if that's perhaps been abandoned.
Laura: All right. I want like a crazy eye in my Seeming.
Sam: Of course you can! I'll give you two crazy eyes.
Matt: (laughs) You now have two crazy eyes.
Liam: That's an improvement. That's nice.
Matt: The majesty of bardic illusion.
Taliesin: So we're going to go to Beyond the Horizon.
Matt: Going to Beyond the Horizon?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: All righty. You guys step out into the day's sun. Today is fairly overcast. Clouds have taken the sky, and there is a bit of a light mist that is falling. Not quite rain, but not quite drizzle, but just a mist in the air. It's a cold day. The ground and most of the walkways and roads are a little damp due to the moisture in the air. Not muddy, just a little bit of a packed wetness to it. As you head over towards Beyond the Horizon, and that lies more in the northwestern quadrant of the city. A little ways around the street from one of the noble houses, so you keep a wide berth. You come to the row of shops that bookended it before, and you go to the curiosity shop to find that the building itself is partially collapsed and ruined. The door is torn off the hinges and left to the side. Part of the ceiling is fallen in.
Sam: Is there a basement?
Laura: Yeah, secret doors? Can I use a perception check to see if there's any kind of secret entrances in the rubble at all? Something that leads to a cellar?
Matt: Do you wander into the building? You guys are still on the outside--
Liam: How collapsed is it?
Matt: The whole building is still standing. It just looks like the front entrance is caved in and the doors were pulled off.
Laura: I'll just old lady walk into the building and look around.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'll go in with her.
Taliesin: Do old ladies lick the air?
Laura: Yeah, she does. This crazy-eyed old lady does.
Liam: Yeah, the eyes, they never go in the same direction; one's always to the left and one to the right.
Matt: Looking about the inside, most of the furniture has been broken or taken. You can see a bunch of shelves set up as this was once a curiosity shop. Empty. Anything of worth has long been taken.
Sam: Oi, Grandma! Any yo-yos in there?
Laura: I'm looking, boy.
Matt: A large scattering of broken glass, and a peppering of stains. Dark, ruddy stains across the hardwood floors you can see spattered in places. Occasional rat seems to crawl out in the distance a little (rat squeaking) sound. But there is no other sign of life within the interior. Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Laura: Ooh, with no advantage, right?
Marisha: What time is it?
Sam: Oh, until noon.
Marisha: Until 2PM, yo!
Matt: Wisdom check, not saving throw.
Marisha: Oh, never mind.
Liam: 13.
Matt: 13?
Liam: 13.
Laura: That would have been an eight.
Matt: Eight. Okay. You take a while pushing through some of the rubble, checking behind the main desk, if you will, as to where most purchases would have taken place. The place is cleared out, and looks like it's covered in enough dust to have been left here for the better part of six months to a year.
Laura: I can't see any kind of like door that leads to a cellar?
Matt: Glancing about, you find what looks to be a small cellar door that opens up in the floor in one of the back rooms. You open it up, there's a small ladder, not even a staircase, a ladder that leads down in there. It's a small room, about ten foot by ten foot. That room is also entirely cleaned out.
Laura: All right. No yo-yos here, boy.
Sam: Thanks, grandmama.
Taliesin: Can we use this as a base of operations in the moment, then?
Laura: But it's half-collapsed, it would not be very protected.
Travis: Yeah, we're fully exposed.
Sam: Let's just take a walkabout and see if there's anything else around the area.
Travis: Do you want to head in one of the directions of the mansions?
Taliesin: Let's head to the closest mansion.
Matt: Okay. So you skirt back towards the the crossroad, the nearest crossroad that heads northward to the very, very far northwest section of Whitestone. There you come to this noble house, which has a nice bronzed fence around the outside of it. Probably about seven feet tall with these intricate spears affixed to the top, almost in a fleur-de-lis type pattern, but looks sharp enough to keep anyone from trying to leap over. The front gate is currently chained off with a lock on it. There is a lawn, but the lawn itself appears to be frost-crusted from the evening's moisture and cold temperature. What grass is there is very gray and dull and currently crisp with a white frost dew. Is a slight hill, and you do see the building itself. It's a very nice building. It's a deep brown. A lot of it appears to be like natural stained wood from the local forest surrounding Whitestone, with highlights of deep green and black. There does not appear to be any immediate sign of life from the inside, but there does appear to be a light coming from the inside, so even at this point in the day, it can be dark on the interior. You can see a little bit of light coming from one of the doors.
Marisha: Is there a mailbox with a name? (laughter)
Sam: Are there guards out front or anything, or is it just a gate?
Matt: It's just a gate, currently.
Sam: Do you want me to go in?
Laura: What if we went to the fields and we asked other peasants how we report to what's-his-fuck. Keron. Keron?
Taliesin: Kerrion.
Laura: Kerrion?
Travis: Oh. That's actually a good one.
Taliesin: I will say, chances that anybody in any of these buildings is somebody we're going to want to take care of is very high.
Laura: So, just bust on in and kill them right now.
Sam: Just, whoever's in there?
Marisha: Is that actually what you're saying?
Liam: And you went from focusing on Kerrion, to kicking in doors?
Travis: Are you feeling all right?
Laura: Yeah, you look a little pale, Percy.
Taliesin: I am a little pale.
Marisha: It's kind of like the game show problem.
Sam: Well, you know.
Laura: Are you sick? Does Keyleth need to cast, I don't know, Restoration on you or something?
Taliesin: I just had a bad night's sleep, that's all.
Travis: Scanlan, go knock on that door.
Marisha: Do you have a fever?
Sam: I'm just a little peasant boy.
Marisha: Is he running a fever?
Matt: He is not actually, he's quite cold and clammy.
Marisha: Ew.
Taliesin: My nice jacket. We can ask around. See if we can manage to ask somebody without arousing--
Sam: Is anyone else on the street?
Matt: Right now, in this particular area, there is nobody on the street. You passed a few folks. A lot of them seem to be traveling southward.
Taliesin: How far are we from the temple? The Alcove?
Matt: The Alcove is a little further east, it's probably about a 15-minute walk. The other temple, that one is about a ten-minute walk south of here. It's closer to the southwestern side of the city.
Taliesin: We could take a walk to the Lady's Chamber and see if we run into anybody there or on the way, and it's only ten minutes out of the way.
Travis: The Lady's Chamber?
Taliesin: Not as exciting as it sounds.
Liam: You know someone there?
Taliesin: (sighs) It's not looking like it.
Sam: I bet it's empty. I mean, it's a temple. The other one was.
Travis: All right, but I thought we were killing somebody in this house.
Sam: I thought so, too.
Taliesin: We'll get to it.
Sam: I can just pop in there and see who's in there and pop out.
Laura: Be killed? Never pop back out again.
Taliesin: He doesn't know what he looks like, anyway.
Sam: I'm just a peasant boy. You wouldn't kill a harmless peasant boy.
Taliesin: I think they would, actually. They already have.
Laura: We saw the tree.
Taliesin: Genuine proof that they are perfectly fine killing a small peasant boy.
Liam: What is there in the way of guards out in the open now, and those giants strolling about?
Matt: The skulking humanoids you saw last night that were wandering the streets? None of them visible. You do take in that far down the road to the east of you there is a large shape looming around the corner in a shadow stretching across the road. And you hear the distant (muffled stomping noise).
Liam: Are we within eyeshot of that thing right now?
Matt: Not yet. It looks like it's coming around a corner at the bend of the road a ways to the east.
Liam: Is there anyone our size, any humanoid guards around?
Travis: No.
Liam: Nothing?
Matt: Currently? No.
Liam: I'm guessing the best time to sneak into any of these places is during the day.
Marisha: Do we want to sneak in, though? You're the only one who knows what they look like.
Matt: It's coming around the bend.
Marisha: Okay, wait. Are the gates locked?
Sam: Let's get out of here. Take a walk, we're going to take a walk.
Taliesin: We're going to take a little walk and let it pass by. Let's go to the Lady's Chamber.
Liam: Lady's Chambers, anyone?
Sam: Towards the Lady's Chamber. We're not going in.
Liam: It's full of prostitutes, Grog. Full.
Taliesin: You'll see. It's not really that complicated.
Liam: What did you roll?
Matt: All right. You guys dart southward across the road, ducking into the alleys of the southern portion of the road, getting out of the visual range of the zombie giant that is making its way down the road, across your path. Heading southward, you dart through the back alleys and keeping free of the main central visual areas of the city, you eventually make your way to the corner that houses the Lady's Chamber. And as you guys see it--
Sam: Have we passed any people?
Matt: If you're keeping an eye out for that, yes. In some of the alleyway, you do pass a couple that are holding some, what looks like either scavenged groceries or some sort of food they have keeping close to themselves.
Sam: Can I go talk to them?
Matt: You can, indeed.
Laura: I'm going to come with you.
Matt: All right. As they're both walking by, keeping the hush, they see you guys step in the same alley. They stop for a second, looking you over, give a nod.
Sam: Oi, excuse me? My papa sent me to send a present, a gift of sorts, to a Sir Keri? Kurion?
Laura: Kerrion?
Sam: Kerrion?
Laura: Kerrion?
Sam: We're just looking to see where we can deliver the gift.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: Scanlan's forte. Come on.
Sam: 29. (laughter)
Matt: You both stop and the man gives her a look like he's trying to usher her along, pulling her arm and she goes, "No, honey, it's just a child." Walks up and leans forward and says, "If you're looking for Sir Kerrion, you'll find him in the extravagant abode to the southeast of the city."
Sam: The one right over there?
Matt: "No." And gives you a side look for a second and says, "You don't want to go find the Countess there. If you're looking for Sir Kerrion, you go to the southeast. Look for the brick building. That's where he stays. Near the farming area south of us. You're not from here are you?"
Laura: We're new to town.
Sam: She's blind.
Matt: "Well, just do what he says. Don't question. All right?"
Sam: Okay. I just need to bring him this sack of presents, or my papa will whip me pretty bad.
Taliesin: TMI.
Matt: "Then perhaps you could do that quickly."
Sam: You're so pretty and clean.
Matt: She blushes for a second, goes like, "You stay safe." And brushes the hair out of your eyes for a second and pinches your cheek a little bit, and there's a look of sadness in her eyes, almost like, what horrible fate befalls this child, if he's not careful.
Laura: I smack him on the back of the head and say: Let's go boy! Keep up!
Sam: I'm her seeing-eye boy. (laughter)
Matt: She rushes back to the side of the man with her and, "See, it's fine. Good luck!" And they both dart off down the alley again.
Liam: Sam Riegel, ladies and gentleman, he played Gavroche in Les Mis. Gavroche, right here, Gavroche.
Matt: On Broadway. Literally.
Taliesin: He is Oliver Twist.
Sam: (singing) Consider yourself! (speaking) Oh, that's a different show.
Taliesin: I was ready! I was ready.
Matt: All right, so. You make your way southward to probably what's the second largest road intersection in this city. Away from the Sun Tree square. You can now see the temple to Erathis here. And it is a large stone half dome amphitheater set up where it's built outward to face the actual crossroads. And there is a courtyard built around it, a small stone wall about three feet tall, that encapsulates this area. There is a couple of trees, but there isn't a lot of grass, most of it's just stonework-- Erathis being the goddess of civilization. You know, it has an interesting duality and disrespect to Melora and all unbridled nature. Things that are controlled and civilized are definitely her realm of expertise. But as you approach, like most of the grass here, it's pretty desolate and dead. Winter is definitely making its way to this part of the city. You do notice that surrounding it, there is dried ivy, and just a general feeling of solemn desperation and sadness. There are a few people scattered throughout sitting on benches, sitting in quiet contemplation. Some of them are clutching small holy symbols and doing a prayer to themselves while rocking in the bench. You do see within the dome, there is a group of about four people that are all sitting, looking up to a man, an older man with a thick, white mustache and receding white hair. His gray robes he's wearing look weathered. You recognize him. While you haven't had too much interaction, not being much of a pious man, in any form of religion from your history, but you do know, Keeper Yennen is the head priest of Erathis here and is currently giving the tail-end of a small sermon to those here. Hearing him, he speaks words of comfort talking of, through these dark days, we must bind together as a community. We have to ensure that our livelihood and our existence is kept, and we look out for our fellow man. There is solace in the friendships and bonds we keep here. And best not to upset those that wish to keep us down. Erathis looks over us. There will be a time in which our salvation will come. And he goes into this very rallying speech and trying to lift the spirits of those around.
Marisha: You said there was 40?
Matt: Four.
Marisha: Four. Right.
Sam: But they're allowed to assemble?
Matt: Yeah. There's four around him in the amphitheater. There are probably another ten or so scattered about the various ground surrounding it, just doing their own private prayer.
Taliesin: Do I have an opinion on Yennen?
Matt: Yennen? From your previous experience and what you've heard is a very-- can be a bit arrogant in his worship, but not in a way that is considered dangerous or impactful to when the de Rolo families were in rule. He does good for the people. Kind of a tool at times. But he practices well and he keeps the people's spirits up for those who worship.
Taliesin: We found him a bit obnoxious to our means and ends on occasion?
Matt: On occasion, but mostly just his personality. Nothing he's done personally. He's not a bad person, by any means. He's just, you know.
Taliesin: He's also not a lapdog.
Matt: Yeah. Strong-willed in his ideas.
Laura: Can we insight check him to see if it seems like he's changed at all, or if he's still that same douchebag or if he's--
Matt: You would have no basis of comparison. You would be the only one that has.
Taliesin: I'm going to walk up to the little meeting. Is it wrapping up right now?
Matt: It seems like it's winding down. He finishes the discussion about the bonds of community, speaks about this city sprang up from nothing, but has a greater destiny to itself. If not here at Whitestone, one day we will all go past these boundaries, these borders, and create our own cities. There is hope for this. And then begins to go into a couple of familiar prayers tailored specifically to the Erathis way of thinking, and then finishes and everyone looks up, bows their heads for a second and begin to stand up and walk away from the amphitheater as he turns around and begins to clear off one of the back benches for him to sit on.
Taliesin: I'm going to just walk up and start a conversation.
Matt: Okay. You walk up to him, he sits down. "Can I help you?"
Taliesin: Do you think there's any hope for Whitestone? Do you think there'll be a day the people can find happiness again?
Matt: "I can say this. If history has taught me anything, our people are a resilient bunch. There has been much death, opposition, to all the free peoples of these lands. And yet, they persevered and surmounted these odds. I think, though, to some degree a prison this town may have become, perhaps we ourselves cannot see the distant ends. It's easy to misinterpret the means of those that would oppress us. But we can't go too long before the world at large can see the atrocities committed, the terrible entities that walk these streets."
Taliesin: Do you think there will come a day that these people can seize freedom for themselves against their oppressors?
Matt: "I look forward to a day in which there can be a beacon of outside hope. From the inside, I fear many wills have been torn asunder. I'm sorry. Forgive my manners. Welcome to the Lady's Chamber. You are unfamiliar to me." And he looks out at you guys standing at the peripheral of the amphitheater. "Travelers?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "I fear the cold winter is looming. An ill omen takes this city, friends. You may stay to give worship, if you will, then I recommend you continue on your way. There is little here but dying tradition."
Taliesin: I have a prayer to give.
Matt: "Interesting."
Taliesin: I pray for a day to come when outside forces can rally the people of Whitestone again. That strangers may come and bring with them salvation, and that the people will seize it.
Matt: "You speak in strange confidence for a traveler."
Taliesin: Look for signs, Keeper Yennen. Look for signs. I'm going to hand him a piece of parchment.
Matt: "Signs of what, I might ask?"
Taliesin: Salvation. Good day to you, sir.
Liam: Act cool. Everybody act cool.
Taliesin: We walk south.
Travis: We walk south. We leave.
Taliesin: And you know what I've left him.
Matt: Yeah. As you're walking away, you hear his voice call out after. "Wait! What does this mean?" He pulls the parchment forward, revealing the symbol of the top of the de Rolo family crest.
Taliesin: That... (sighs) What appears dead may not necessarily be death. And that with the shadow of death over the city perhaps there is life deep underground. Perhaps things that appeared ended and gone are perhaps continuing to this day. And may rise again.
Matt: Go ahead and make a persuasion check. Give you advantage on this.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Nods his head slowly, looks back at the sheet. Looks back at you with a discerning look.
Taliesin: He's definitely not going to--
Matt: Oh, not at all. You look like a dirty peasant right now. Takes it and hastily closes it and folds it and puts it in the pouch. Steps back over and gathers some of his loose tea leaves-- he was making himself some tea-- and looks about shiftily, calls over one of the other worshipers and begins talking with them as you guys walk away.
Taliesin: Let's head south.
Travis: South it is.
Sam: To the--
Laura: To the house?
Sam: To the house.
Taliesin: Kerrion Stonefell's stately manor.
Marisha: So wait, which mansion were we at?
Sam: The Countess.
Laura: The Countess.
Taliesin: Countess Anna Ripley.
Marisha: Which mansion is that out of the three?
Taliesin: That's the northeastern one.
Marisha: That's the northeastern one?
Laura: And she was which? Who was the Countess again?
Taliesin: I'm assuming if it is who I suspect it is, it's Countess Anna Ripley.
Sam: And who is she to you?
Taliesin: She is a terrible person.
Sam: Wait, she's the one who killed a bunch of your people, right?
Marisha: She's the doctor, right?
Taliesin: She's the doctor.
Laura: Oh, she is the one!
Travis: Do we get to kill her?
Taliesin: I hope so. But let's-- one at a time. If we're lucky, maybe one a day.
Marisha: Well, okay.
Travis: Like a vitamin?
Sam: Like a Flintstone's vitamin. Except it's assassination.
Taliesin: (coughs)
Sam: Do you need some healing? Are you okay?
Taliesin: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sam: Scanlan can make you feel good.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Travis: (laughs) He can make you feel real good.
Laura: Can I go up and ask Keyleth, outside of his earshot, to maybe cast some sort of restoration on him, without-- He's fighting it. I don't think he's feeling well. Can you heal him?
Marisha: I'm mean, yeah. He's going to feel it once I cast it on him, but I can try.
Laura: He looks cold and kind of slimy, and he's coughing a lot.
Travis: Wow, that's harsh. Looks cold.
Sam: He's probably been up tinkering all night.
Liam: Who are you to talk, Crazy Eyes?
Laura: I know.
Taliesin: I look like like a dirty peasant right now.
Laura: No, that's true.
Marisha: I don't know if my-- I don't know if Greater Restoration will work.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Should only take 20 minutes to get to the house, shouldn't it?
Matt: Yeah. Approximately.
Taliesin: We're not passing anything interesting on the way, are we?
Sam: Any other safe houses? Potential candidates?
Matt: I mean, there are plenty of houses that currently don't show signs of life.
Taliesin: I was thinking mostly of the barracks or the Alcove.
Sam: Yes, but after we kill this thing, we're going to need to know where to go.
Taliesin: Got some thoughts.
Sam: Thoughts? We need a place to retreat to immediately.
Taliesin: The Lady's Chamber.
Sam: It's an amphitheater isn't it?
Taliesin: There's quarters. They'll be able to hide us.
Marisha: What makes you think they're going to hide us?
Taliesin: Hunch.
Sam: Shouldn't we have a backup plan, in case they turn us out onto the street?
Taliesin: Actually, my thought was if we take care of Stonefell, why don't we hide in his house?
Laura: Nobody will know, right? Let's do it!
Sam: That's a good plan. They probably have some good wine.
Travis: I always wanted to be a lord.
Sam: All right. Let's go assassinate someone.
Marisha: Percy? I don't mean to beat a dead horse or anything, but--
Taliesin: If it would make you feel better, you can do whatever you like, but I think it's just a tickle.
Marisha: No. You're sure about all of this?
Taliesin: This has been what I've been working for for years. I'm not going to lose-- I was surprised last time. I've had time to think about it. I'm going to be all right. And I'm keeping it together. I'm not going to pretend that I'm great. But I've got a hold on it.
Sam: They also have technology, now. They have weapons, guns, that they're developing. It could be a threat to many, many other people.
Marisha: Well, that I'm fine with. No, not that I'm fine with. I mean, I'm fine helping prevent that. I'm just more worried about your sanity than anything else.
Taliesin: I've got a hold. And I respect that if you think that I'm slipping, you'll let me know.
Marisha: Okay. You followed me into the fiery abyss, so--
Taliesin: If that isn't a sign that I must be crazy, I don't know what is.
Marisha: Touché. I'll follow you, though. I'll follow you to the end.
Sam: As the oldest among us, I say that he's fine.
Taliesin: Are you actually the oldest among us?
Sam: Well, I assume so. How old are you people?
Laura: What?
Travis: Me?
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Somewhere between one and 50.
Liam: Well, I'm 27, but I don't know how old she is.
Matt: And with that, rainfall begins to hit upon the city--
Laura: Oh no.
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: The ground immediately becomes thick with mud and sludge as you begin making your way through the city to the eastern side.
Marisha: I go puddle hopping!
Taliesin: This is not a happy place.
Travis: Low key.
Liam: Low key.
Marisha: Oh. I look miserable.
Taliesin: Look wet.
Travis: I take the Dust of Tracelessness to void out any footprints in the mud.
Liam: It's been washed away with the rain.
Matt: You do it. As you walk along, you do, some of the mud shifts behind you. It can be a little conspicuous if you're not careful.
Travis: Oh. Not my normal flower girl routine; maybe it's like the old Shawshank Prison walk. (laughter)
Taliesin: The old Shawshank Prison walk.
Matt: All right. The Alcove is a little ways north. It would take some time. You're pushing at like 10:30 in the morning at this point, around 11AM. Are you going straight to the supposed homestead of Kerrion Stonefell?
Laura: Let's do it!
Liam: We're going straight there?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: We're going straight there.
Matt: All right. You bee-line it. You're all getting cold from the wet rain that is now soaked through your clothes. You make your way, and this home is a deep, red brick in construction. This house was not here when you lived here. It looks like what house was here has been demolished and rebuilt with sturdy masonry. It's a two-story building. There appear to be two guards currently set outside. Two regular leather-armor looking, more thugs than guards, but they're just both keeping under the overhang at the front porch to keep dry and grimacing at the weather. There is a gate around it. This gate is more for purpose than visual presentation. It's a black iron, nasty, jagged, rusty-looking gate. Not too dissimilar to the one that surrounded the graveyard. It's about a 20-foot walk from the gate entrance to the front step of the actual building itself. How do you want to approach this?
Taliesin: Let's walk around the back, I think.
Liam: As we walk up, I'd like to trail back by Grog in the rain. The killing's going to start soon. It's not going to stop. We're going to protect them. All of them. (laughter)
Liam: Yeah, big guy?
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: All right.
Sam: Vax, you have your daggers back, right?
Liam: I got them all.
Laura: I put a couple arrows in the holy oil that we have.
Matt: All right. Each holy oil is essentially three--
Laura: Oh, can I just dip one arrow in, then, right now?
Matt: Mark that off from one of your holy oils, you have one of three uses of that, and that that arrow does have a holy oil essence.
Sam: Percival? If we get in there, what are the chances that this gentleman, Sir Kerrion-- Korean--
Taliesin: You can mispronounce his name. It's fine.
Marisha: Sir North Korean.
Taliesin: Sir Starbucks, yes.
Sam: Sir Starbucks. What are the chances that he's going to be in a coffin? Sleeping?
Taliesin: 50-50.
Sam: Okay. All right. Good to know.
Travis: Would it be worthwhile to maybe say that the little boy and the old lady were caught hoarding crops and we brought them to this guy, see if we can draw him out of his house?
Sam: Ooh, that's a cool plan. I like that plan!
Marisha: It is raining.
Sam: Oh, wait, but I would be bait?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Okay, fine.
Taliesin: Let's take a long walk around the house to see if there's a way in through the back.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: It's dark. It's raining.
Taliesin: And I can't imagine that many people attempt to infiltrate this house.
Liam: How dark is it?
Matt: I mean, it's overcast, but it's getting closer to noon. Even though you can't see the sun, and it is dark clouds overhead, it is still a general universal storm light. Darkened daylight.
Travis: Once around?
Marisha: Does it look like it's going to pass soon?
Matt: No. It looks like it's probably going to be here for most of the day at the very least.
Sam: The rain will dampen the screams from inside. So we go around once? Once around?
Matt: Okay. Perception checks all around.
Sam: Perception check.
Liam: I'm looking specifically for ways in the building other than the front door.
Sam: I'm looking for clouds because I rolled a two.
Travis: Four.
Taliesin: 21.
Laura: 24.
Liam: 20.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: All right. I will say above 20s, you guys notice there is a cellar door outside the building that descends beneath it. There's no indicator as to whether or not it's attached to the house or if it's just an exterior cellar that you can enter from the outside. You do also see there are a number of windows around the household that are all currently closed that lead into the interior. You're uncertain if they're locked or open. There's a little bit of light from the inside.
Marisha: Like candlelight?
Matt: Like candlelight or lantern light, the darkened exterior has made most of the sunlight that would warm a building or light it up from the inside has been cut off by the rainstorm. So, there is a necessity for internal lighting.
Marisha: Is there any sign of windows that are blacked out?
Matt: No, but you do notice that one of the windows to the far back side of the building where most of the light's coming from-- occasionally the light does seem to shift or a shadow moves past it. There's movement within that room nearish that window.
Sam: They're watching TV.
Laura: Probably. I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Sam: Ooh, thank you!
Marisha: Are we going through the cellar?
Sam: Is our meal still affecting us?
Taliesin: Until two.
Sam: Yes! Let's go in quick!
Laura: Is it possible to see what the movement is, who it is inside that window?
Matt: Not from this 25 to 30-foot distance from the building and you guys trying to be inconspicuous.
Liam: There's nothing between us and the building?
Matt: There is the gate. The gate, and what looks to be a few rocks and a couple small trees that are on the actual grounds of the house surrounding it.
Laura: Is the cellar door hidden from view of everything or is it out in the open?
Matt: Which one?
Laura: The cellar door that we saw.
Matt: The cellar door is out in the open, buttressed against the back of the house. It's up against the ground on the side. It has two doors that open up and lead into the cellar below.
Laura: Does it look like anybody can see us?
Matt: From where you're standing? No. You're going to be hardpressed to get across without being in sight of somebody if someone were nearby.
Marisha: We're between a fence, right?
Matt: You're on the outside of a fence.
Travis: Do we want to try to draw them out or get to the cellar? Either way, those two thug guards are going to die.
Marisha: There are guards?
Laura: There's two guards.
Sam: There's two guards.
Matt: They're currently not in visual range of you. They're guarding the front of the building. You guys moved around back. So you don't see the two guards currently on the opposite side of the house.
Travis: What's the fence made out of? Is it the spear-y shit?
Marisha: Is it poky up top?
Matt: It is poky. yes.
Travis: It is poky.
Matt: It's not super sharp poky, but there's iron rods.
Travis: So, I could throw Scanlan over.
Liam: If you roll a two, you can get hurt.
Matt: Yeah, if you rolled poorly, it's going to deal some damage.
Sam: Should we do a diversion for the guards?
Laura: They can't even see us, though!
Sam: Yes, but once we go through the fence, they might. I don't know. All right, you want to sneak in?
Taliesin: Let's try to sneak in and leave the guards there unless they notice us and then we'll just (thwip thwip).
Sam: All right, sure!
Travis: How do we sneak in past them?
Taliesin: You want to try to pull one of the wrought irons off, maybe?
Travis: I'd be down for that.
Sam: If I puffed some smoke, would it draw attention to us?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Okay, then never mind.
Taliesin: It's raining. We can make a little noise, it'll be okay.
Liam: Where are the guards in the front?
Matt: They're currently on the opposite side of the building. If you guys are looking at the back. They're in the front of the building guarding the front door.
Liam: Inside the gate at the house?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: Want me to heat up that metal bar for you?
Liam: We still have to go over and in.
Travis: Sure.
Laura: Let's just up and over the bar, athletic it. Acrobatics it?
Liam: Grog, can you bend that shit open?
Matt: Your donkey's still there beside you.
Laura: Fuck!
Liam: Yeah, well, if Grog can frigging make a hole in there--
Travis: Can I try and Lou Ferrigno those bars?
Matt: You're more than welcome to. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: The bar that he's--
Taliesin: Lou Ferrigno-ing.
Marisha: -- Lou Ferrigno-ing, I'm going to cast Heat Metal.
Sam: Is that going to burn his hands?
Marisha: Put on some gloves.
Travis: I don't have any gloves.
Marisha: Spit in your hand a little bit. Grip and bear it.
Sam: It's raining. It'll be fine.
Matt: So, you cast Heat Metal on the bars and a certain area of this gate begins to glow with a dull orange to become a brighter orange, and portions of it going whitish-hot in places.
Sam: Why don't you just hit it with something?
Laura: Wrap your hands.
Marisha: You can use your axe.
Matt: The rain, by the way, is puffing against it and evaporating as it impacts the now-heated metal.
Sam: But that'll be loud!
Marisha: You do you! You do you, Grog.
Travis: I rolled a 23.
Matt: 23? Okay, you reach over and grab it, your hands smoking on the-- use the pain! Use the pain and pull down the bars. You get a large portion of the gate to actually bend downward into an arc, causing the whole gate to fold inward on that side, making it much easier for anyone to pass through. However, you do suffer nine points of fire damage from the burn and your hands are currently scalded.
Taliesin: Now we can get Trinket in!
Liam: That's a hangnail on his pinky toe.
Travis: It's all right.
Marisha: I go ahead and I cast Healing Word on his hands.
Matt: Okay. So it's 1d4 plus six. She's rolling it.
Marisha: Ooh! 11.
Travis: Hey, back to full!
Matt: So, the scarring stays for a bit. You do smell the burning flesh, but there's no lasting wounds on your hands.
Taliesin: You can check to see if there's a lock on the cellar door?
Liam: Yeah, sure.
Travis: We gotta make it across the lawn first.
Laura: Well, we're in the back of the house.
Liam: Well, we're all just walking very quietly.
Laura: We're stealthing.
Matt: So, everyone make a stealth check.
Taliesin: We have advantage?
Matt: No, everyone gets plus ten to their stealth. You have disadvantage on the stealth check, though.
Sam: Plus ten.
Matt: Yes, plus ten to your stealth roll.
Sam: 17.
Travis: 23.
Liam: 34.
Laura: 32.
Marisha: 34.
Taliesin: 26!
Matt: All righty. You guys all keeping low and quickly darting across the grass field. You make your way, pattering across the somewhat slick grass. The rain is a little warmer than the frost that kept the grounds frozen as the morning came to. So, it's a little slick, but you make your way to the back of the building. You're still loosely out in the open, in a weird way, so you don't want to be out in the open for a long period of time. This isn't a safe place. You're currently, apparently made it to this side of the building unnoticed. But you don't want to stay here very long because you are visible to anyone who's on either side of the gate exterior.
Liam: I'm going straight to the cellar door.
Laura: Up against the wall of the building.
Liam: I give it a little (clunk) to see what I feel.
Matt: It is locked. It does gives resistance.
Liam: I get to work.
Marisha: Do your thing.
Laura: I feel like it's been a while since you've done this.
Liam: Did what?
Laura: Lockpicking.
Liam: I already did it earlier when you weren't here. 14, that's 27.
Matt: 27. You reach over, without even looking. You grab the lock; you're familiar with this kind of lock. (clicking) You take the lock off the chain. The chains fall loose against the opposite side of the, or the inside of the door. You pull it open. It's dark inside. You can see the dry stone steps that lead down below the building as rain starts darkening them with drops that are hitting them.
Liam: I lean my head in really fast and just see if I can hear anything, and roll a one.
Laura: Could I stealth in a couple of steps look around and see if there's anybody in there, or hear anything?
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Liam: No, I said it's good! It's good! Let's go! Right? You agree. We're never wrong!
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19. Listening to the inside. The smell's a little musty, like a cellar you'd expect. But a little bit of dust and untouched earth. There's nothing down there; no movement, no sound.
Laura: It's clear, let's go! Ish!
Matt: You all drop in. Darting into-- which is good, because you notice around the corner one of the giants is turning the corner. You all dive inside, close the cellar doors. Bringing you to the interior.
Laura: I wonder if they're going to notice that fence.
Sam: They might.
Matt: You hear the pattering of rain across the wooden doors of the cellar. You made your way down underneath. And it is pitch black. There is no light source down here.
Liam: I pull out my Flametongue Dagger.
Matt: Okay. A little bit of flame causes enough candlelight to see the surface. And it is a wine cellar.
Travis: I have Darkvision.
Marisha: I'll go ahead and use my flaming hands.
Matt: Okay, so with an instant of will, all of a sudden flames burst around-- [no audio]
Matt: -- is a small ladder in the corner that seems to lead up to a latched door that leads to the interior of the house.
Laura: I got up to it and listen.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: I don't hear anything, you guys. I think it's fine!
Liam: My ears are bigger than yours. Let me have a listen. Get down.
Laura: Yeah! Your ears are huge compared to mine!
Liam: Definitely, look at them!
Matt: Your sister assures you she heard--
Laura: There's nothing there!
Liam: I don't hear anything, either. I think we should just bust in.
Sam: Okay!
Travis: Wait.
Taliesin: (whispers) Quietly!
Marisha: Wait, hang on! Grog just said wait!
Liam: I keep forgetting the rogue skill, so really I rolled a 20.
Sam: Wait, what? You rolled a three and it becomes a 20?!
Liam: For perception, I can no longer roll lower than ten, unless I roll a one. But if it's a two or nine, it's actually a ten for me.
Laura: That's awesome.
Matt: Rogues are pretty cool.
Taliesin: That's crazy.
Laura: Yep, rogues are awesome.
Travis: Rogues are whatever.
Matt: So you put your ear up to it and listen carefully. And you hear pacing footsteps creaking against wood no more than maybe four feet away from you.
Liam: Is that one person?
Matt: One person stops and then moves again, then moves again almost like there's pacing, and you hear low voices. It's a conversation; there's two voices. You hear one voice very muffled, but it seems to be similar to the voice of the gentleman that came across you guys on the street that actually briefly talked to Percy the day before.
Liam: The old guy; the balding guy?
Matt: The balding guy with the long stringy gray hair.
Liam: He's just reporting in. He's his frigging money collector.
Matt: The other voice you don't recognize, and it's too muffled for you to make out anything. About four feet from you, not over the cellar, but off a ways to it. You're not certain where this doorway leads to, the level of muffling you can hear through the floor leads you to believe that they're not directly above you.
Liam: Not directly above. All right. There's nobody right above us, but there's people in the house.
Laura: They might be close.
Travis: Just to be clear--
Liam: No, they're on another floor or in another room.
Travis: Before we start  we're killing everything, right?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Okay, good. Do we want to send one person out sneaky and then have a code word like Cheeto if it all goes wrong?
Marisha: Last time we did that, it went really well.
Travis: Did we do that before?
Liam: No, we didn't send anyone, I just--
Taliesin: Let's just go one room at a time.
Sam: One room at a time? We have to get up through this latch and there's people right above us!
Liam: Scanlan, you or me? You want to go invisible, or do you want me to creep in?
Sam: I think you should have some fun, too. But before we do anything, do you want me to send a cloud up there of gross smoke to smoke out the area?
Liam: No.
Taliesin: No.
Taliesin: Let's not let them know we're here.
Laura: Wait, before we do this. Keyleth, can you maybe make the gate outside not look like it's all bent to shit?
Liam: Zombie guards aren't going to-- giants are stupid.
Sam: It'll be fine.
Liam: They're stupid. I mean, there are the guys out front.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: It's fine!
Sam: What could go wrong? This is a stealth mission. We'll be in and out of here in six minutes if we do this right. Let's go! Go, go!
Marisha: Wait, are you going in? Are you infiltrating?
Liam: I'll go up and see what I see. Just above us, not far away.
Marisha: I touch Vax's shoulder and I cast Enhance Ability and I'm going to give you dex saves-- what do you want?
Liam: I'm good on that.
Marisha: What do you want advantage on?
Liam: Not dexterity. Constitution. I'm feeling a little weak.
Marisha: All right. Constitution.
Matt: What's this for?
Marisha: Enhance Ability. So I think it's called Bear's Constitution or something weird.
Matt: Advantage on constitution checks. Those are different from saving throws.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Checks.
Matt: But it does give him 2d6 temporary hit points, but those do not stack with the current temporary hit points you have. Constitution would not be of much benefit to you.
Travis: We could just set a fire down here.
Marisha: Okay. Do you want dex or anything?
Liam: I'm pretty dex-y already.
Marisha: Instead, I say, good luck.
Sam: Bonne chance! Vive la résistance!
Travis: All right.
Liam: I'm going to check and see if it gives at all or if there's anything to it.
Matt: (creak) It gives.
Liam: It gives. All right, so I'm going to go up.
Travis: Invisible or not?
Liam: No, stealthing up. All right. So, okay, hold on, I get advantage. 23.
Laura: Wait, no. Plus ten because Pass Without a Trace.
Liam: Oh, 33.
Matt: 33. You move it up, without a sound, dart up, catch yourself and lower it down carefully. Dark interior, you use your Flametongue Dagger to look inside. You are inside of a closet of some kind, a ten by five closet. There are coats and outfits around you. You can push them aside. This looks to be like a small storage room that has been repurposed as a closet of some kind.
Liam: I am listening intently and feeling through as many pockets as I can find around me.
Matt: Easily enough. As you put your ear to the door, they are talking immediately on the other side of this door. You are a room adjacent to it. You do manage to pocket from a few of the coats about 47 gold pieces in total.
Marisha: Who leaves that much in their coat pockets?
Travis: Dead people, that's who.
Liam: Can I make anything out through there?
Matt: You make out conversation. It seems to be between a voice you don't recognize and the gentleman earlier you met, basically saying, "With everything that's going on now, it's honestly very frustrating that these people wouldn't do their share of the bargain. I, myself, I've been doing my best to keep them in order, but at this point in time, I think we need to do another show of strength in order to keep them working as hard as we have been." Another voice calms him down and says, "Don't worry, don't worry. Keep it under control. At the very least, we should have to be ready, prepared. If what Lady Briarwood says, we should be having visitors any day now. And I would hate to be caught flat-footed. So, we're going to go ahead and gather our arms, going to make sure that we outfit the place the best we can. Traps, alarms, whatever is necessary to make sure that we are not caught off-guard." (laughter)
Marisha: This is about to be hilarious!
Matt: You guys came at just about the right time.
Liam: I'd like to-- everybody hold.
Sam: Hold?
Laura: Hold.
Liam: I just want to wait for one minute and see what progresses.
Matt: Okay. The conversation continues. The older gentleman begins talking about, "I don't like the idea of there being any sort of conflict on our home turf. I wish they would just meet them out, head them off, cut them off at the head. Why did we invite them in here? That seems to be a dangerous circumstance."
Liam: While they're talking I say  we've got two gentlemen up here.
Sam: Two gentlemen!
Laura: Okay. I start climbing the--
Liam: I think it's time to start killing.
Sam: Grog up first!
Marisha: Places everyone, places!
Laura: Grog up before me.
Travis: It's opening night and I'm so excited! (laughter)
Matt: Stealth checks all around.
Laura: Plus ten!
Liam: Send up the goliath.
Marisha: That's good!
Travis: 29!
Sam: 18.
Laura: Plus ten!
Sam: That was plus ten.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 28.
Laura: 34.
Matt: All righty. You all slowly make your way up. There's not enough room for all of you inside this room, this storage space.
Laura: Grog first.
Matt: Grog, you go up, you push open the door into the next room and it is a-- for lack of a better term, a music room. There's a few couches around, there's a piano set up.
Liam: Oh, it went closet to music room?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Oh, we're opening the door?
Matt: You guys are opening a door to a room next to-- the wall you were listening to is the room next to you. This opens up into a room adjacent.
Marisha: A music room! How regal!
Matt: So, as you push out into the room, it's dark in here. The only light that's coming in is from the nearby window. A little bit of sun's coming through from the rainstorm. You can still hear the rain pattering on the window and the second floor above you, there is no sound from the rain hitting the roof from this distance.
Liam: Dart my eyes around. Is there anything that's useful in here?
Matt: Not particularly; it's mostly decorative. Few vases, some books on the shelf. There is a door that is partially open that leads into hallway. A hallway that seems to connect the two rooms.
Liam: Which way are the voices coming from?
Matt: Yeah. The door is the opposite of the window and the room that you're in is adjacent to the room that the voices are coming from. The closet is in between the two.
Liam: Oh, between the two. So it is out, door, hallway?
Matt: Yes, out, door, hallway, and then the room where the speaking is coming from.
Sam: Do you want me to create a diversion of some sort? No?
Laura: Just run in, surprise him.
Sam: Are we going to go around?
Liam: So, we're stealthing, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: So I pull both of their hands and I say--
Sam: Who's they?
Liam: Grog and Keyleth. I start pulling them through-- that's all right. Out the door. Along the hallway towards the voices.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Matt, that's a lot of maps you have down there.
Laura: Really? Really?! I'm offended. And I'm hurt.
Marisha: I look back at Vex and I just go--
Laura: I give you the worst evil eye I've ever given anyone.
Liam: Too bad one's going that way and the other's going that way.
Sam: As they go, I quickly lock eyes with Grog and I give him a quick little inspiration. (singing) Blood, glorious blood! Grog's about to take some. Dead dudettes and dudes, Grog's about to make some! (laughter)
Matt: All right, so take a d10 inspiration die. So, the three of you move on ahead. The rest of you-- Trinket is unable to climb.
Sam: Oh! Can I? Trinket  stay. (laughter)
Laura: I smack the back of your head again. And it's hard because I'm angry right now.
Travis: Do you have any of your rings on? Turn them inside and (impact noise).
Marisha: It's the mom slap, exactly! It's the grandma backhand.
Matt: All right, the three of you stand at the double doors. You moved around to the hallway. Is there a change to this arrangement that you would like? You currently have Grog, Vax, and Keyleth at the front, and three of you in the back.
Laura: Yeah, I want to stealth in behind Grog after they go into the room.
Matt: All right, so there you are. I'll put you on the side of the door there. You hear the voices from the other side of the door conversing and talking back and forth. Scanlan, Percy.
Marisha: Oh my god. Someone say something cool!
Matt: What's the plan?
Liam: I put my hand up in the air.
Sam: de Rolos, roll out!
Liam: And I click my boots together. (click) Feel that adrenaline rush.
Travis: I rage.
Liam: And I kick the door as hard as I can and go right in!
Marisha: (scream and cheer)
Taliesin: (scream and cheer)
Sam: (scream and cheer)
Matt: (impact noise) The door swings open, both of them slamming into the sides of these two bookcases. Immediately, you see behind the desk here and standing in the center.
Liam: It's Kiefer Sutherland.
Matt: You see the older gentleman in these long robes immediately spin his head and see, essentially, a troupe of armed villagers, peasants, dirty faces come rushing in. all fucked up eyes and all. Rushing into the room. They both turn, looking completely caught off-guard by this. You do also see in the room, there are a few guards that are just waiting off to the side. There's a couch area, there's a fireplace.
Marisha: Of course. Damn guards.
Matt: You guys get a surprise round.
Marisha: That's right!
Matt: So, let's go ahead and roll initiative to get the order of things here.
Travis: Advantage on initiative because I have that thing.
Sam: Are you alert? Do you have Alert? Is that what it is?
Travis: I have Feral Instinct.
Sam: Ooh!
Travis: Which I forget sometimes. That's better.
Sam: (sing with the battle music)
Laura: (sing with the battle music)
Matt: All right, so 25 to 20?
Travis: 20!
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: All right. 20 to 15?
Sam: 16!
Laura: Whoa! Look at you, Scanlan!
Sam: Better figure out what I'm going to do!
Matt: So, Scanlan is 16. 15 to ten?
Liam: 13.
Laura: 13.
Marisha: 13.
Liam: Half-elves!
Matt: Ten to five? Is that everyone?
Laura: That's all of us.
Matt: That's everyone, yeah.
Marisha: Bitches gonna die!
Matt: All righty! First, surprise round from all of you guys, catching them off-guard. Up first is Percy.
Marisha: Percy!
Taliesin: I'm going to pull into that empty-- Oh, I've got a button, don't I? I'm going to pull into that corner right there?
Matt: Over here?
Taliesin: And I'm going to take two shots at that soldier in the corner, that guard.
Matt: Okay. The guards, you can see, are wearing dark studded leather armor, no cloaks. Both have rapiers or stilettos, daggers on their sides. They look at the sudden intrusion and begin going for their weapons. You caught them off guard.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22 does hit.
Taliesin: That's just a d10, where are my d10s? That's nine points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Another shot to him.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: That's a misfire. I'm going to do a quick repair. And that's fine.
Matt: Does the repair take an action?
Taliesin: No, it takes a--
Matt: Okay, so you're fine. It does not break. Cool. That's your turn. One shot off. The blast rings out. As you fire the pepperbox, it misfires, and you quickly throw one of your tools in the air, catch it, and with one swift movement you unblock the passageway, click it back up into its place. Out of the corner of your eye, you turn, and for the first time in five years, you see, standing behind the desk, Sir Kerrion Stonefell. Visually, nearly the same as the last day you saw, except maybe a bit of white on the sides of the hair. Armored with a nice set of relatively ornate leather armor, blue hues and blacks. The hair itself is this tousled brown. There's a boyish charisma to him, if he wasn't such an asshole. And the moment you see him, there's this boiling rage from within just to have that moment of sight.
Taliesin: If you're lucky, you die last.
Matt: There's a look of complete confusion, as he has no idea who any of you are. You look like paupers that literally burst into his office. That ends your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I hear him say that he has to die last, and in my rage, I race forward to that fuck in the middle of the room and I swing my Firebrand Warhammer at him twice!
Matt: All righty!
Travis: I would make to make this first one a new feat called Great Weapon Master.
Matt: All righty!
Sam: What does that do?
Matt: Minus five to hit.
Travis: I'm going to use my-- no, not on that one. That misses.
Matt: What did you roll?
Travis: A two! So that's 11. Yeah, that misses.
Matt: That definitely misses. As you swing in, (nervous yell) just ducks out of the way, and even though he's older, he reacted pretty quickly. Your weapon slams into the ground, splintering some of the wood. You peel back for a second attack.
Travis: That makes me even angrier. And now I'll use inspiration. 18... minus five, 23!
Matt: 23 does hit! Plus ten damage.
Travis: Okay. Plus eight is 13, 17, 27!
Matt: 27 points of damage, ooh!
Travis: Plus four for the fire damage, but still the 27 total.
Matt: So, as he ducks out of the way, you bring up the hammer a second time and (whack) smack him right square in the chest. (grunts) The wind escapes him for a moment and the flames lick across the front of his chest. He catches himself on the table between the sofa and chair behind him. Gets back on his feet. Looks to you for a second and pulls out two short swords.
Travis: That's the best thing you could have ever done.
Matt: "I don't know who you are, but you're going to regret this!"
Laura: What does Grog look like?
Matt: Grog looks like an oafish butcher. Tubby on the sides, an oldish, middle-aged looking man. Scruffy beard. Scanlan does his best on that one. Whatever other visual you want to--
Sam: Potbelly.
Matt: Huge potbelly. Grog, that ends your turn?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: All right. In theory, it is a surprise round. So you may have had advantage on that first strike, so go ahead and roll it.
Travis: (screams) 26. Minus five is 21.
Laura: 23. No, you're right.
Travis: Yeah. 21.
Matt: Roll damage again. We'll say this is an additional third strike in reaction to him pulling his blades out.
Travis: 32.
Sam: Jesus! God!
Matt: (wham) The hammer slams him a second time and he almost drops his weapons. The actual end table he's resting on shatters beneath him and he, (grunts) has to get back up onto his feet. Looking genuinely fearful now. That ends your turn.
Travis: You dropped your toothpicks.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Okay, so he's been attacking the old guy.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: Those two flanking the big boss are just guards, right? They're just standard-issue guards?
Matt: Best you can tell, they're both in studded leather armor. They don't look like guards, like armored, they look like thugs that are essentially there to watch.
Sam: All right, well, I'm going to run in the room.
Matt: About how far in?
Sam: Make a left. I'm sorry, turn right, away from the action. And then I'll look at the guard behind and to the right of the big guy.
Matt: That guy there.
Sam: The good guy-- the bad guy.
Marisha: You got it.
Matt: That guy there?
Sam: No, this guy over here. And I'll Dominate him.
Marisha: Is that also a guard? There are three guards?
Taliesin: There are three guards.
Matt: All right, you're going to attempt to Dominate Person.
Sam: Yes. I pull up my hand cone and I say, (singing) You're as cold as ice! Willing to sacrifice your boss! And so I tell him to kill his boss. (laughter)
Matt: What's the DC on that?
Sam: 19.
Matt: Wisdom. He rolled a 17. That's a fail.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: He is currently Dominated by Scanlan.
Travis: (singing) Cold as ice!
Matt: Good to know. So, as he pulls his heavy crossbow out, loads it, and aims it towards you, looks over his shoulder for a second, and trains it on his boss. Sir Kerrion looking confused by this whole circumstance.
Marisha: Cool.
Matt: That ends your turn?
Sam: Yeah, that's it.
Matt: All right. Keyleth, Vax, and Vex, take your surprise rounds now.
Laura: Can I go first so I don't do any damage to you guys if you guys go in?
Marisha: I'm also probably going to do a ranged spell.
Liam: What are you guys talking about? Kill him!
Laura: I want to go in, peek my head in and shoot-- first, I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to use-- it turns into three arrows for one of my attacks, so it's three more attacks, potentially?
Matt: Well, it's two additional attacks against the one arrow. So you'd get four attacks in one round, essentially.
Sam: Good god!
Laura: Okay! I'm going to do that! I'm going to attack him, the guy.
Matt: Which guy?
Laura: The bad guy.
Matt: There's two bad guys in there.
Laura: The one that's in charge. Kerrion.
Matt: Sir Kerrion? All right, go for it.
Laura: Yeah! 28.
Matt: 28 hits.
Laura: Okay, so I make an attack for all three arrows.
Matt: Correct. That was one of them. You fire it, it splits into three along the way, and you roll for each attack on each arrow.
Laura: Oh, that one doesn't hit. Well, probably not. 13?
Matt: No.
Laura: 18?
Matt: 18 unfortunately does not hit, either.
Laura: Jeez Louise, what a waste of a storm arrow.
Matt: And you still get a fourth attack with your second--
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Hunter's Mark?
Laura: That was the wrong thing. I can't; I'm going to Hunter's Mark him after this first one because it's a bonus action.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Laura: What am I doing? 14, 15, 16, and then plus another d6, so it's basically like Hunter's Mark, right?
Travis: Nobody knows what you're doing. (laughter)
Matt: So the first arrow does an additional lightning damage.
Laura: 19 is the first one. And then I attack again. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him now. Can I do that?
Matt: You haven't used your bonus action, so yes you can. Two eyes going all--
Laura: 29.
Matt: 29 does hit, yes.
Laura: I'm so confused right now.
Liam: Us, too.
Laura: I know. 14 on the second one.
Matt: Okay, gotcha. So your arrows split, two of them embedding into the actual desk itself and exploding with a burst of electricity. A third one strikes him in the chest and you can see it stick in the armor and (boof) jolt him for a second. He backs up a little bit, catching himself on the edge of the desk as the final arrow comes and strikes him in the shoulder. He cuts off the shaft of the arrow as it hits (grunts) out of anger and frustration.
Laura: I totally shit the bed on that one, guys, and I apologize. I had things I wanted to do.
Sam: After she does that, I say  that was my grandma! (laughter)
Laura: That's right, boy!
Matt: This little boy.
Travis: Adding to the confusion.
Matt: Do you want to move at all? You would've had to move into the room to do that shot because you were outside in the hallway.
Laura: Huh?
Matt: You were in the hallway when that happened, so I'd say you'd have to be in the room to shoot them. Where would you want to be?
Laura: Oh, just right inside the door.
Matt: Right there in the door?
Marisha: What kind of armor is Sir Kerrion wearing?
Matt: Best you can tell, it looks like a very high quality studded leather.
Marisha: Studded leather?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Can I say I peeked in to shoot and then went back around the side of the door?
Matt: Yeah, you can do that.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Keyleth, Vax.
Liam: Is it up to us?
Matt: You guys are the last ones to go.
Liam: Go.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to cast Call Lightning. And I'm going to bring down a bolt. Here we go. This way. Right in between Sir Kerrion and this guard so they both have to save from it.
Sam: Take that, Sir Korea!
Marisha: Yeah!
Taliesin: Kerrion Stonefell.
Matt: As a thing of note, a storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is ten feet tall with a 60-foot radius centered on a point you can see in the air.
Marisha: Oh, so it's going to--
Matt: The room won't fit it, unfortunately.
Marisha: The room won't fit my storm cloud?
Taliesin: That sounds like a great song.
Matt: It says if you're in a room that can't accommodate the cloud, it can't appear.
Marisha: Pooper muffin. Okay. Well, then.
Matt: If you want to consider your next move, Vax can go.
Marisha: Yeah, go Vax.
Liam: I am running straight towards what's-his-name, Kerrion? Is at the desk, so I just run right towards the desk, I step against the desk, leap up in the air and go (stabbing sound) into his shoulders.
Matt: Right there?
Liam: Yeah, no, I'm on the desk in front of him, going for his chest.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: First, and I get advantage on everything is a-- It's a 30! And this is surprise attack, so it's a critical hit plus the sneak attack damage. This guy is going down! One plus seven is eight-- what gets doubled?
Matt: Just the dice.
Liam: Just the dice? But not the sneak attack damage?
Matt: No, the sneak attack damage, as well, but just the modifiers don't get doubled.
Liam: Okay. So that was-- okay, two plus seven is nine. Nine, ten, 11, 12, 18, 23, 29, 33, 66 for the first attack, darling.
Sam: 66?!
Liam: 66! Here comes the second dagger into him at advantage.
Marisha: 66?!
Matt: Surprise rounds.
Liam: Is 28, so that obviously hits. And that is seven. And then the third dagger comes down. Is 29, and that also hits. So I've shanked his ass, that's an eight. (stabbing noises)
Sam: That's 15, is 70-- is 81.
Matt: Yep. 81 points of damage in one round of combat. As you land on the desk, your daggers bypass the armor and they find their way through the top of the armor and sink past the clavicles into the deep portion of the chest. He (choking noise) from the impact and you hear him choke and blood splatters up from his throat. He reaches up and grabs your hands and lifts them off out of the wound. You see a gout of blood pour from the wound as you reach back and stab him a third time with the dagger as you catch yourself on the desk. He reaches up and kicks you, forcing you to get back on your feet with your daggers at the ready. The blood's beginning to pour. It's not a mortal wound, but it's looking really bad for him. He's not on death's door, but that definitely took him down a few pegs.
Liam: I give him a Vex wink.
Matt: (laughs) He looks at you and growls. Draws two rapiers from his side.
Travis: Two rapiers?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: He draws two rapiers? Do we get any indication by what we just saw if he might be a vampire or something?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Marisha: I can make an insight check? Ooh, yeah! 27.
Matt: 27. Nothing yet has given away any sort of essence of that. He doesn't look particularly pale.
Taliesin: He's also aged. He's a bit peppered.
Marisha: Yeah, he has aged.
Matt: He definitely looks wounded and unhappy.
Liam: Can I ask a technical question?
Matt: Sure.
Liam: According to Assassinate, any hit I score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit. Any hit. So are the two subsequent attacks--
Matt: After the first hit--
Liam: That's sneak attack. This says, "in addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit."
Matt: Right. Okay.
Sam: Any? He wouldn't be surprised after the first one.
Matt: I'm usually under the impression that after the first hit, they're no longer surprised. They know you're there.
Liam: Okay. Okay. Got it.
Travis: (grunts) Ow! (grunts) Ow?!
Liam: Well, I thought they were like 0.3 seconds apart, so I thought it was so fast.
Matt: That's true. I'll allow it.
Travis: Oh!
Taliesin: What?!
Travis: Double what?
Liam: Double the last two attacks. Which were much less.
Sam: It was 15, so it becomes 30.
Matt: Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, he's not happy. Really not happy. Okay. All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: All right, I'm going to do some fun shit. So seeing Vax go up and get next to Lord Kerrion or whatever the shit his name is. I'm going to go and turn into a dire wolf this time. Mixing it up from Minxie.
Taliesin: That's like a normal wolf.
Marisha: But slightly bigger.
Taliesin: But dire.
Marisha: But dire. It's white, a wintery wolf from the mountains that I'm from.
Matt: You are now filling up the entirety of the double-door frame right now.
Marisha: I'm going to rush and use my pack tactics and flank Lord Kerrion.
Matt: At your size, you can't quite get to him, unfortunately. You can try and move around this way, maybe. You will probably take an attack of opportunity from this guy, but you can try and move around.
Marisha: Oh, from a random shithead? Yeah, let's do it.
Matt: What's your movement?
Marisha: 50 feet.
Matt: Yeah, you can do that. You move around and you get over there.
Marisha: Is that flanking?
Matt: It's not flanking, no. Yeah, it's not flanking per se. I mean, you're adjacent to him. You'd have to be on opposite sides to flank.
Marisha: I know, that's what I was trying to get. All right. Well, then, since Vax has that guy, I'll go for this guy. Take him out.
Matt: Okay. So you move into that guy there.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: That is the most peasant-looking direwolf ever.
Matt: Yeah, this little peasant girl just went (growls).
Marisha: Ooh, that was a 19 to hit.
Matt: That'll hit.
Marisha: Okay, 2d6 plus three. That's not great, four, five, six, seven, eight piercing damage, and then do I also-- oh, and he has to make a DC 13 strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Matt: He rolled a 12.
Marisha: (cheers) So he's down.
Matt: He's knocked prone. How much damage was it?
Marisha: Not a lot. What did I say, six?
Matt: Six points of piercing damage?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: He's knocked prone. (impact sound) Falls on the ground.
Marisha: Do I get my fiery stuff for that?
Matt: What attack was it? Was it bite?
Marisha: Bite.
Matt: No.
Marisha: Okay. Okay, he's down.
Matt: All right. Is that your turn?
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: All right. That ends the surprise round. Now we're at the top again. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to take one step forward. I'm going to shoot that guard once, one more time.
Matt: The one over here?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Fuck it, I'm going to try sharpshooter. And that's 14, 15, 21 to hit?
Matt: 21 hits.
Taliesin: That'll do 19 points of damage. Actually, that's more than 19 points, because it's a fire shot, so 19 plus two, so 21 points, with two points of fire damage in there.
Matt: 21 points of damage. All right, (gunshot sound) you fire. There's a burst of flame that gouts out the side of the pepperbox, (impact sound) blasting into the chest of the guard off to the side. He's thrown against the wall from the sheer force of it. Reaches down and grabs his chest and looks at it, and you can see there's this red crimson across his hand, as you've actually blown a piece of his leather armor open and you can see the wound in his chest. There's a little bit of blood trickling out of his mouth, and he looks angry at you.
Taliesin: I'm shooting him again. (laughter)
Taliesin: That's 17.
Matt: 17 hits.
Marisha: Nice.
Taliesin: That's 21 points of damage.
Matt: 21 points of damage, nice. (gunshot) You blast him, this time on the other side of the shoulder, you can see now this armor is now torn open exposing the wound here and his arm's now hanging to one side. He's (grunts). He's looking in severe pain and barely hanging on at this point.
Taliesin: Fall, damn it. Shooting him again.
Marisha: Kill him!
Taliesin: That's 20 to hit.
Matt: 20 to hit. It hits.
Taliesin: Eight points of damage.
Matt: Eight points of damage. All right, this is the final one as he's looking at himself; he's like (pained noises), angrily looks at you, picks his crossbow up and aims it at you. Before he gets a chance to, you aim your third shot, (gunshot) firing, hitting him right in the center of the head, (impact noise) blasting out part of his face, his body spins, and then he falls over into the plant in the corner, slumped over it there.
Taliesin: I finish walking almost into the corner over there, right next to him, about there. Spend an action surge, taking three more shots at Kerrion.
Sam: Whoa.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: Damn.
Taliesin: This is a sharpshooter round.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: That's 19, 26 to hit.
Matt: 26 hits.
Marisha: Do you crit on a 19?
Taliesin: I don't crit on a 19.
Marisha: Fuck!
Taliesin: Oh, that'll do. 24 points of damage plus a point of ice damage. So, 25 points of damage.
Matt: Plus an additional d6 points of damage for that.
Taliesin: Yay! Because he's an asshole. That's six more points of damage.
Matt: So, as you go around and fire from the barrel, the shot fires out. And as you recoil you guys, for those who are noticing off to the side, this dark smoke's beginning to slowly pour out of Percy's body, out of his eyes and his ears and the hand on the gun. There's black smoke beginning to emit from his body and beginning to envelop the gun arm.
Sam: What?
Marisha: We all see this?
Matt: For those who are paying attention, which right now would be pretty much just Scanlan and Vex.
Sam: You're weird.
Taliesin: So you don't see shit. Shut up.
Marisha: I'm not crazy! No, and I'm at this guy's throat.
Taliesin: I'm going to take a quick reload, and I'm going to fire again, with Sharpshooter, and I'm going to do a head shot.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So, I'm going to attempt to make him have issues doing things. Natural 20. (cheering)
Travis: The golden snitch strikes again!
Marisha: Yeah, it did! I can see it from here!
Matt: Damn!
Taliesin: I swear it's-- yeah.
Matt: With the additional d6, by the way.
Taliesin: What?
Matt: With the additional d6.
Taliesin: Does the d6 double or does it not double?
Matt: All dice rolled double. Then add the modifier.
Taliesin: This is going to be angry.
Marisha: Yeah it is!
Liam: Gunslinger warlock.
Taliesin: So.
Marisha: That's pretty "grood."
Taliesin: 42 points of damage. Of fire damage. 42 points, and that's with 5 points of fire damage. 42 points.
Matt: Okay. (gunshot) The first blast hits and you can see the cloak is blown off the shoulder and set aflame and actually burns to cinders in the corner. Sir Kerrion looks down and is like (grunts), and is looking very, very curiously. The second shot rings out (gunshot), and at this point now the smoke is wreathing your entire arm, the gun isn't even visible, it's just this giant column of smoke. (gunshot) The second shot rings out, this time hitting him in the side of the neck and the shoulder, blowing a chunk off of it so part of the bone is now sticking out it's like (noise of pain). He reaches back with his arm and is like with the rapier up, clutching it for a second and leans over and looks back over and is (pained panting) "Ripley."
Taliesin: Just as an action, as a bonus action, I'm going to remove my hat, and I'm just going to say: Drop it.
Sam: Will this take an action?
Matt: To drop the spell? You can do it on your turn.
Taliesin: On your turn, yeah.
Sam: Okay. I think that's next.
Matt: All right, so.
Marisha: He thinks it's Ripley. He thinks it's Ripley with the gun! Ripley's building guns!
Laura: It's Ripley that's doing the guns!
Marisha: Fucking Ripley!
Matt: So. That finishes Percy's turn. It is now Sir Kerrion Stonefell's turn. Kerrion's going to use a bonus action to use Second Wind.
Sam: Oh no, that's some sort of healing thing isn't it?
Taliesin: That's healing. It's not much healing.
Marisha: Wait, who's doing what?
Sam: He has 6,000 health points.
Marisha: Kerrion's healing? Is it a regeneration thing or is he casting a spell?
Taliesin: No, it's a fighter action.
Matt: And that was with the head shot, you said?
Taliesin: Yeah, it was with a head shot. So that means he has disadvantage on attacks for one round.
Matt: And deals damage, right?
Taliesin: And deals damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm a good boy.
Matt: Sir Kerrion is going to, in the circumstance, is going to move this way just to hide alongside Vax, and since you're on top-- his both rapiers out, and you just jammed your daggers in, is going to do a flurry of four strikes against you.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: With disadvantage on all the attacks.
Travis: His clavicles sticking out of his shoulders.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: I'll use Uncanny Dodge for the first one that hits.
Matt: 16, the first attack?
Liam: No.
Matt: All right. Rolled a one on the second. That is a 21 on the third attack. And, no, that's a 14 on the fourth attack. That disadvantage just-- swinging wide, gets one hit on you.
Travis: Get that clavicle; be working.
Liam: Yeah, Uncanny Dodge on that attack.
Matt: That is eight points of piercing damage against you.
Liam: So, four.
Sam: Ooh! That's nothing!
Liam: That's nothing.
Matt: That finishes Sir Kerrion. Sir Kerrion is now going to--
Sam: Turn invisible.
Matt: He's actually going to take a step back towards the wall. You get an attack of opportunity.
Liam: All right. I throw a dagger in his face.
Matt: All right.
Liam: That is a 28.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: That is eight points of damage.
Matt: All righty. Steps back and slams his fist against the wall (thudding).
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: Wait, who did that?
Laura: Kerrion.
Travis: Kerrion.
Laura: He's calling in backup.
Marisha: Wait, he's calling in backup? Shit.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: So, that ends Kerrion's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I keep smashing shithead that's in front of me!
Matt: Okay, go for it!
Travis: That's 24. These are just regular.
Matt: Yeah, 24 hits.
Travis: Oh, I should roll the other one first. Again, 24.
Matt: 24 hits. Are you going into a frenzied rage?
Travis: Regular rage. 23 on the first one.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: And 12 on the second.
Matt: Gotcha. (whack) Is this with the fire damage as well from the hammer?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: Yeah. so the hammer strikes across the back, the broadside of his shoulders and back. (grunts) Looks up at you and looks over at Sir Kerrion being annihilated behind the desk and is trying to nervously gauge his circumstance. Second strike smacks him upside his body and he's like (panting) and he's trying to take in the surroundings and figure out a plan. All right, are you going to stay where you are?
Travis: That's it.
Matt: It is now Master Vouk's turn.
Sam: Who?
Matt: You have not heard his name yet, but it's his turn.
Travis: The guy I've been smacking.
Taliesin: Mr. Rogaine.
Laura: I'm picturing him as what's-his-name in--
Taliesin: From Harry Potter.
Laura: Yeah!
Taliesin: Yeah. I know, me too.
Travis: Mr. Filch?
Taliesin: Filch. Filch on steroids.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: He's going to use a-- okay. He's going to use a bonus action to disengage from you. He's going to back away just one step that way. Use his action to--
Laura: He has magic?!
Marisha: Oh, he's going to Dimension Door out.
Laura: But Mr. Filch doesn't have magic.
Travis: Yeah, he's a squib!
Laura: He's a squib! Squibs can't do magic.
Travis: He knows this. He's making origami.
Taliesin: Don't you get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Actually, instead, he's not going to use bonus action to disengage, he's going to use a bonus action to use Misty Step. Vanishes, reappears over by the wall. Uses the action to cast a level three Invisibility on both him and Sir Kerrion Stonefell. So they are both considered invisible at the moment.
Travis: With the Missy Elliot step, I don't get an attack?
Matt: Not from that, unfortunately; it's an immediate teleport. So he just vanishes from in front of you.
Travis: What the fuck?!
Matt: We'll say, for the purposes of this, they are both currently invisible. And that's going to end--
Taliesin: That soldier hasn't attacked yet, either.
Matt: Correct, his turn hasn't come up yet. Now it becomes Scanlan's turn.
Sam: Oh. Well, I can't see anyone who's alive who I haven't Dominated already, except for the guy under the dire wolf. I will remind all my fellows to keep one alive to spread our terrorist message and I will run out to the hallway and say, Vex, get inside. Because I know reinforcements are coming, I cast Stinking Cloud out into the hallways.
Matt: Okay. Stinking Cloud appears. What's the radius on that?
Sam: (singing) Stinking Cloud!
Matt: I think it's a 20-foot radius, isn't it?
Sam: It says 90-feet range, let's see here. 20-foot radius.
Matt: Okay, cool. So you just filled this entire hallway.
Sam: Yeah. Will it seep into the room as well?
Matt: You can keep it localized to that area, you'll just be in your own cloud.
Sam: Oh. Well, can I stop just short of the door?
Matt: You stop just short of the door and fill this whole area with a Stinking Cloud.
Sam: Sorry, Vex.
Taliesin: You can hold that action until she comes into the room.
Sam: Okay, I will hold that until she comes in the room.
Matt: Okay. So Stinking Cloud is not yet up. Okay.
Sam: Laura's next, I believe.
Matt: So, next round. You are up next.
Sam: And I will inspire her, as well.
Laura: Yay!
Sam: Do you want a d10?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Okay. (singing) Vex be nimble, Vex be quick! Vex jump under limbo stick! Now you don't know how you're going to react because Vex has an attack! Oi!
Travis: Amazing! How?! God! I don't get it!
Matt: You take your d10 inspiration. Confused, but accept the inspiration. A chuckle in the middle of a hearty battle is always worth a little inspiration.
Laura: All right, so I go in the room.
Matt: You step into the room. At that point, you trigger your action to release the Stinking Cloud. You want to stay there? You're just outside of the radius.
Laura: Yeah, I stay in the doorway. Actually no, I back-- well.
Matt: What are you doing, Vex?
Laura: Yeah, I'm staying right there. I can't see; is there a soldier right there next to the invisible guys, or is it just the invisible guys?
Travis: On that wall, it's soldier being eaten by Keyleth, and then invisible.
Sam: There two invisibles, and then another soldier who I have already Dominated. He still hasn't had a turn?!
Matt: Surprise round, and they're lowest on the initiative count.
Laura: Actually, I'm going to do Lightning Arrow because that gets everything within ten feet.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on the soldier on the ground.
Matt: Which one?
Travis: The one that Keyleth's attacking.
Laura: The one that Keyleth's attacking.
Matt: I will say you don't really have visual on him from that position.
Laura: Can I move to a place where I get it?
Liam: Do a bank shot off the ceiling.
Matt: Now you can see, yeah.
Laura: Awesome. Let's do it from there.
Matt: Okay, go for it. You have advantage on the attack roll because he is prone.
Laura: Nice. 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Laura: Okay, so that is 4d8 damage to him.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And then anything within ten feet has to make a dex save.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Is that including your brother?
Laura: Yeah, that's everything within ten feet.
Travis: It's also including invisible guys.
Matt: If it's ten feet, he's not there. It'd just be Keyleth and Sir Kerrion.
Marisha: 22. 21!
Matt: Makes it, 21, actually, exactly.
Laura: 19 to little prone soldier.
Matt: Okay, 19. As it snaps and it bursts, the electricity shockwaves out, he shakes and on the ground takes in the effect. The blast seems to-- is it half damage if they make the save?
Laura: To the little prone guy?
Matt: No, it's to anybody within radius.
Laura: Anybody within radius takes 1d8 if they make the save and then 2d8 if they fail.
Matt: Okay, so roll 1d8.
Laura: One.
Matt: Okay. So one damage to you, and one damage to Sir Kerrion.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: You see a spark of energy around the invisible form as it wavers in place.
Travis: That's good; at least he (electricity noise) around some.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. Vax?
Liam: I saw that spark in the air and I start knifing right into it.
Matt: All right. Was that the last thing you wanted to do with your turn?
Laura: Yeah. Does the Hunter's Mark damage him, the invisible guy, still, if he gets hit with anything? Or is it just if I attack him with an arrow?
Matt: I think if you attack him. That was more of the burst in the vicinity.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: So, hearing him go (grunts) and seeing a spark right in front of me, I start knifing at that point.
Matt: All right. At disadvantage on all the attacks.
Liam: Disadvantage? But I get advantage, so it cancels out.
Matt: Why do you get advantage?
Liam: Oh, no, I don't. I'm sorry.
Matt: Disadvantage on weapon strikes because he's invisible.
Liam: The first one misses. That was it. So, the first two were terrible. That's terrible. That's also terrible. I whiff. I just (whooshing).
Matt: Yeah, you're swinging in the area, and you can't get blades to find any of his physical person. You're striking and arcing across the wooden wall behind him, causing these giant gashes. All right, that ends your turn.
Liam: Still bleeding!
Matt: Unless you want to stay where you are right there?
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to stay there.
Matt: You probably would've had to move up there to attack him. Oh, you're just throwing the daggers, right?
Liam: I back up. Is Keyleth on the desk?
Sam: No, she's next to the desk.
Liam: And I'm on the desk? No, I'll stay where I am.
Matt: Okay, so you're just throwing the daggers from the desk? Okay, that ends your turn. Now, Keyleth.
Marisha: Looking up and noticing that Sir Kerrion is gone and Vax is blindly stabbing into the distance, I'm going to drop my wolf form and cast Faerie Fire in that radius.
Matt: Drop your wolf form.
Marisha: 20-foot cube.
Sam: Mark that shit.
Marisha: Right here.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Realizing my party members are clearly stabbing at something.
Taliesin: I like it when he has to go to the book. Makes me feel like there's, perhaps, things he doesn't know.
Sam: Faerie Fire is an underused thing. It's really cool.
Matt: Yeah, so both of their forms all of a sudden are outlined by this sparking purple halo that shows you directly where they are.
Sam: Yes!
Matt: All right. So that's your turn? You going to move anywhere?
Marisha: I'll back up a tidbit.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Just back up a smidge.
Matt: Okay, as you back up an invisible form that just got revealed swings out at you with a rapier, an attack of opportunity.
Marisha: Yeah, sure, whatever.
Taliesin: But, he's--
Matt: At disadvantage on the attack. He has advantage on her because he's-- although--
Marisha: I can see him now.
Matt: You can see him, that's true.
Laura: This is confusing!
Matt: Faerie Fire kind of made this weird.
Travis: To the books again!
Matt: Indeed.
Marisha: Faerie Fire always makes it weird.
Taliesin: Ain't it the truth? Man, that Faerie Fire.
Matt: Just a minute, folks. Lot of overlapping effects, here, because everyone has magic.
Sam: Now's a good time to go to the store and check out Critical Role t-shirt--
Matt: Yeah, it doesn't benefit from Invisible. It's at disadvantage. It has disadvantage on the attack. That is--
Sam: Brand new t-shirt for sale, guys.
Matt: And 15.
Marisha: Miss.
Matt: Yeah, so (whoosh) as you back up. All right. That ends your turn. Now, this guard gets up, (grunts) gets his crossbow, aims it up and, looking around the room, aims it, this would be-- seeing his friend turn on his boss briefly after you shouted that song at him, is going to turn the crossbow on you.
Sam: On me?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Jesus.
Matt: That's going to be a 16 to hit?
Sam: I don't even know any more. No one's attacked me in a while.
Taliesin: It's your AC.
Sam: It's 17.
Matt: 17!
Sam: Well, it's 15 plus two because I've got some thing on.
Marisha: You've got the amulet on.
Matt: All right. So, as it comes towards you, you just duck out of the way and it passes and snags into the wall behind you (arrow landing sound). No hit. The thug is then going to drop the crossbow on the ground and rushing up, pull out a mace that was hanging from the side of its belt and engage you right there.
Travis: I thought he was coming for me.
Sam: I thought so, too. That would have been good!
Matt: This guy is going to attempt to make two attacks against Master Vouk Strono. Has advantage on them because Faerie Fire. That hits. And, two attacks with a mace. That is 18. Yeah, hits with both. (whack whack) With the mace both times.
Marisha: Is that the guy who you charmed? Awesome.
Taliesin: Nice.
Sam: Wait. Who's this?
Liam: The guy you charmed.
Sam: That's not my guy, Matt.
Matt: That guy?
Sam: Oh, that guy there is, yeah. Oh wait, he's attacking my guy?
Matt: No, he's attacking the guy that's invisible. (laughter)
Matt: Doing a total of 16 damage with his mace. (whack whack) Bludgeoning. He's now going to try and make the saving throw to shrug it. What's the DC on that?
Sam: On my spell?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: It's 19.
Matt: 19. Yeah, he does not make it. Still under control. That ends the thugs' turn. Top of the round. Percy, you're up!
Marisha: Go Percy, go Percy, go!
Taliesin: Sharpshooter against Kerrion.
Matt: Sir Kerrion, okay.
Taliesin: Do I have advantage on that because of Faerie Fire?
Matt: It does not benefit from invisibility and you have advantage. Yes, you do. Vox Machina: broken. (laughter)
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 to hit?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Misses.
Taliesin: Taking another shot.
Marisha: That was with advantage?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: Pooper.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: 20 does hit.
Taliesin: 15 points of damage.
Matt: 15. (gunshot) You see one blast hits the wall and causes part of the wood to splinter outward. The second shot impacts the partially invisible form. You can see a splash of blood across the desk in front. Partially spattering across Vax and one of his guards.
Taliesin: Third shot with ice. No sharpshooter. Natural 20!
Travis: What?!
Marisha: Percy rolls!
Travis: What the hell?!
Taliesin: It's making up for my gun failing four times.
Travis: Whatever, you possessed Voldemort.
Taliesin: I know.
Travis: (laughing) Smoke arm.
Taliesin: Six, 16, 25, 31 points of damage. 31 points of damage with four points of that being ice damage.
Matt: So, Percy  how do you want to do this?
Travis: He said that weird.
Marisha: This against Kerrion, right?
Matt: This is against Sir Kerrion.
Sam: Wow! How do you want to do this? That's the logo that's on the shirt that's for sale right now.
Taliesin: Oh, stop it.
Travis: Is this the name on one of the barrels?
Matt: Percy.
Taliesin: Don't cheapen this!
Sam: Too late.
Matt: Currently visible, at your disposal, Sir Kerrion. You have enough of a shot to finish him off. The smoke is pushing you, "Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance." Repeatedly echoing in the back of your mind. How do you want to do this?
Taliesin: I'm going to put on the mask, since he still doesn't know who I am.
Matt: Okay. You pull the mask down, the bird-beaked element to the mask now wreathed in smoke, resembling, very closely, the entity that made the original bargain with you.
Taliesin: I'm going to walk up to him. Yeah, there's no way to drop the illusion. That's such a damn shame.
Sam: Oh wait, you told me to!
Taliesin: I did.
Sam: I could have; I didn't. Fuck! (laughs)
Marisha: Could you do it now, for flavor?
Taliesin: That's fine. The mask will do. I'm going to take one last shot. I'm going to look right at him, I'm going to catch his eye. This is for the de Rolos. And let me say: you were the one I was least looking forward to.
Travis: That's some cold shit!
Matt: With that, the little bit of wreathed magical energy you can barely make out an expression of horror on the face before the resounding blast sound rocks the room. The actual bullet itself a trail of black smoke behind it as it impacts the front of Sir Kerrion's face. The entirety of his head caving inward as the back splatters across the scarred wooden wall behind him. The body slumps to the ground immediately. You guys all glance over at Percy. You don't even see Percy, you just see a humanoid entity made of black swirling smoke energy with the peaked beak of his mask poking through.
Marisha: Not 100% sure what's going on. Can I take my Faerie Fire concentration that I still have up and move it over top of the black smoke figure?
Matt: Can you move a Faerie Fire?
Marisha: I don't know; can I move a Faerie Fire?
Matt: I think when you use it, it just stays where it was. Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's how it works.
Marisha: 20 feet; is he in it, perchance?
Matt: From there, it's 20 foot, no. Not from where you placed it right on him, unfortunately. That's okay. Yeah, no, it just happens once.
Marisha: Never mind.
Matt: With that, you recoil from it and the voice echoes in the back of your head, going "Yes."
Taliesin: I'm going to drop the gun.
Matt: You drop it (impact sound).
Taliesin: Remove my mask. Run to find something metal, something sharp, anywhere on the table. And just start scratching off the name on the gun. I'm just going to go to a corner and just start scratching the name off.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: He's disturbed.
Matt: Okay, that's your turn.
Taliesin: That's my turn.
Matt: Sir Kerrion is gone. Annihilated. That brings us to Grog.
Travis: Percy's having all the fun. And I start smashing that fuck that's looking at Vax.
Matt: Right there, okay. So you move up to him, (whoosh) swinging the hammer wide.
Travis: Might as well make these great weapon master strikes, just for fucking why not. That's a 15.
Matt: 15 just hits.
Travis: Yeah, that's awesome. And the second one-- Yeah, that's pretty good. 28 minus five. 23.
Matt: 23 hits.
Travis: Okay. 15. 20 is the first one, with the fire damage. Oh!
Laura: Actually that's 30.
Travis: Yeah, 30 is the first one. Plus 10. And 13, 16, 26 for the second one.
Matt: Okay. So as you rush up, you can see, it's pulled out its mace and is swinging it in a wide arc towards Vax. As soon as you rush up, it looks to you out of the corner of the eye, drops the mace and before the mace can hit the ground, your hammer actually swings around, hits the mace, and then both your hammer and the mace slam into the side of his head, pushing him down onto the desk. Stunned, blood spatters across the wood as he's (gasping) twitching on the table, already done. And you swing the hammer, lift it up, (impact sound), like Gallagher performance, the head just (explosion noise). (groaning)
Laura: This is disgusting.
Liam: Happy Halloween, folks.
Travis: Great weapon master.
Matt: Vouk is currently looking very--
Sam: He's Vouk-ed.
Matt: Yeah, he's Vouk-ed. All right. Is going to cast Haste on himself and is going to run, dropping invisibility, and leaping through that window.
Laura: Doesn't the guard get a--
Matt: The guard gets an attack of opportunity, and Keyleth does. The guard has advantage. A three. No, the guard misses, with a mace.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Laura: Yeah! With your fire hands?
Marisha: No, it's with my staff, I'm assuming, right? Unless I wanted to deck him in the face.
Matt: No, this would be with your staff.
Marisha: This is with my staff, okay.
Matt: You just (whack).
Marisha: So it's five, so that's 11. I don't attack a lot. 13 damage.
Matt: 13 damage?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. As you smack him at that point--
Marisha: I just clothesline him. I see him running, I'm like (grunts).
Matt: It brings him exactly to zero. (cheering)
Matt: You whack him right in the face, knocking the teeth out, and he just falls to the ground. Unconscious and bleeding.
Sam: Good, yes, keep him alive.
Matt: All right. That ends his turn (laughs). Wow. Man. Surprise rounds, man. You guys are nasty. All right. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Scanlan's up?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: All right. I go run up to the guard I have dominated, and I just-- Is he still dominated, can I change the domination?
Matt: I mean, you can cancel it, but otherwise he's just--
Sam: I mean, can I change it from "kill your boss" to--
Travis: "Kill yourself."
Sam: To "give up"?
Matt: Yeah, you can tell him. You can't tell him to attack himself.
Sam: No, I will tell him--
Taliesin: You-- Oh, go ahead.
Sam: No, what?
Taliesin: I was going to say, tell him to go tell anybody else in the house everything's fine.
Sam: Oh. Ooh! That's good.
Travis: Yeah, because we should kill the more powerful guy.
Taliesin: Tell him that everything's fine.
Sam: Okay. You there, guard! Go tell everyone that everything's fine. Go into that Stinking Cloud out there and tell all your friends that everything's hunky-dory.
Matt: Technically, Stinking Cloud is a concentration spell.
Sam: Is it?
Matt: So if you were to maintain concentration on that, you would lose your Domination.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Matt: So it's your call. Which one do you want to maintain?
Sam: The domination.
Matt: Okay. So the Stinking Cloud fades from the hallway.
Sam: Stinking Cloud is concentration?
Matt: I believe it is. Spells like that usually are, if it's to maintain--
Sam: It is! I never wrote down a C next to it.
Matt: This is where that circlet would come in handy.
Taliesin: Can I run over to Kerrion's body?
Matt: You will be able to shortly.
Sam: You mean the thing that Orion took from me? Yeah, the thing that I needed? Yeah.
Matt: It's all right. He's used it pretty well a couple of times.
Sam: Yes, so I tell him to go warn his friends-- not warn his friends. Tell his friends that everything's fine. All is good.
Matt: Cool. Good to know. That ends your turn. Is anyone going to take any specific actions?
Laura: I want to loot the bodies.
Taliesin: I'm running over to Kerrion and just going to rage loot him.
Sam: I'm going to go to the desk.
Matt: Okay. While you guys all do that, the guard leaves the room. You hear a few whispers in the hallway, a conversation with a person unseen.
Liam: I walk towards the door.
Travis: Uh-oh.
Sam: A giant attacks.
Matt: The conversation fades and the guard walks back, seemingly job done. Also is going to make a wisdom saving throw. That is a 17?
Sam: 19.
Matt: He remains dominated. You guys now-- For the moment, the threat seems to have subsided. At the moment. You're still in the house and there's still, apparently, things in the house. Whether it'd be guards or other individuals in the house that are on edge as they heard a series of gunshots ring out, screams, and other sorts of cacophony. The fact that this is even right now being handled is a very lucky series of rolls on his part.
Travis: I want it said that this one should die. He has magic. He's too strong. They could set better traps.
Sam: We can interrogate him, though. Get crucial information. He's an officer.
Taliesin: I can't talk yet.
Matt: So you're going through Sir Kerrion's body.
Taliesin: I'm taking his swords, and I'm going to use his sword to get that deep gouge into the gun.
Matt: He has two rapiers, so it's like holding a stiletto.
Taliesin: And anything he has on his body, I'm taking it.
Matt: He has a potion of greater healing on him. Never got round to actually using it.
Taliesin: And once there's a good gash in the name, I'm going to sit down and breathe.
Matt: Okay. As you finish gashing the name out on the side of the metal and start breathing, you can see the name itself begin to glow with a slight dull purple glow and burn away from the metal, leaving just the scratch marks. From his body, you have two rapiers, regular rapiers, studded leather armor that is enchanted with a plus one bonus, and that potion of greater healing. So you can mark those down.
Laura: I'm keeping a very strong eye on Percy right now.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Anything on the desk, papers of any sort?
Matt: Going through the desk? Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Sam: It's a lot. Yeah, it's tons. It's 27.
Matt: Yeah. You find wax seals, you find parchment, you find pocket change, about six or seven gold pieces just left in there. On himself though, on his actual person, on Sir Kerrion's body, you find about 320 gold pieces as his own personal fund. Looking through the desk, you find mentions of the bridge plan to move between the two continents. To go across the channel to Wildmount. Basically plans, the discussion, a lot of what they were planning to do with Emon.
Marisha: Someone write that down.
Sam: I got it.
Matt: You also find a small notebook that just has some hand notes of his.
Sam: I'll take it.
Matt: Okay. So mark that down.
Travis: I start tying up unconscious guy on the floor.
Matt: He's currently-- He's got to zero hit points, he's bleeding out.
Marisha: What about the dominated guy? He's about to save from it. Domination, he can save from it at any second.
Travis: No, I know. I thought we wanted to interrogate--
Matt: Which he does not; he's still dominated.
Liam: I take a rag out of my pocket and I roll it up and I shove it into Kerrion's mouth while Grog is tying him up.
Taliesin: Kerrion's dead.
Liam: I thought he was out.
Sam: Vouk's.
Travis: The balding guy.
Liam: Balding. All right.
Travis: We tie him up, he shoves a rag in his mouth, I put one hand on the top of his head and the other hand under his chin. Should we bring him back just a little so we can ask him some questions?
Marisha: Vouk?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay, but what are we going to do about dominated guy? Can we tie him up, too?
Laura: Yeah, tell him to go sit in a corner, Scanlan.
Marisha: He could save from that any second. We need to like off him or something.
Taliesin: There'll be time for that.
Liam: I got it. Could you tell him to look in the corner?
Sam: Turn away, look in the corner, Blair Witch style. (laughter)
Laura: Oh, this is so wrong.
Matt: Doesn't make his save.
Laura: Oh, terrible.
Sam: Grog, do you want to?
Laura: No, this is so wrong.
Travis: What? We're asking questions. We got to bring him back, just a little bit.
Sam: Are you on Vouk's right? Or whatever-his-name?
Travis: We're on Vouk.
Liam: Can we put him to sleep, or anything short of me knocking him out?
Sam: I can put him to sleep.
Liam: Put him to sleep, then.
Sam: But I have to drop my thing first.
Laura: Just knock him out.
Liam: I'll do it. I'm really good at knocking people out.
Marisha: Just knock him out. Knowing what's coming, I'm going to Druidcraft some pretty kaleidoscope-y flowers in front of his face. Pretty image before you die.
Matt: All right. He seems momentarily confused before the blow of the-- Are you hitting him with the blade or pommel?
Liam: Oh, pommel.
Travis: Before we knock him out, should you make sure that whatever he tells people is truly fearsome? But not too descript about us?
Sam: Well, he already told his friends in the hallway--
Travis: That everything was fine.
Sam: That everything's fine. So now we're just knocking him out.
Marisha: While all this happens, I'm going over to baldy. Lord Vouk or Mister Vouk and pop a Cure Wounds potion into him. How far down is he? He was just at zero. I brought him to zero.
Matt: Yeah, he was unconscious and he was making his death saving throws. I was treating him for that circumstance. When you go straight to zero like that, you know--
Marisha: Yeah. All right, I'll pop a Cure Wounds into him.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: The guy in the corner? Scanlan, could you go stand next to him and tell him a joke?
Marisha: I was giving him pretty flowers.
Liam: You're standing next to him?
Marisha: I gave him pretty flowers to look at.
Liam: You walked over and gave him pretty flowers?
Marisha: I Druidcrafted from a distance.
Travis: Are you standing next to him?
Sam: I walk next to him and sort of distract him with a little soft shoe tap.
Liam: Thank you. That's what I needed. I got an 18. Sorry, I got a 29. And that is eight plus 14, 22, six, seven, 32.
Matt: 32. He is (impact noise) from barely damaged to nothing. He goes immediately unconscious in the corner, face down, in the middle of a bookcase.
Marisha: I drop 18 points of healing into Vouk.
Matt: Okay. (gasps, chokes)
Travis: The rag's in his throat. You are going to listen very carefully as my friends ask you some questions. You'll shake your head yes or shake it no.
Laura: What are we going to ask him?
Sam: (laughs) Percy?
Taliesin: I'm not available right now.
Sam: All right.
Liam: All right.
Liam: Come on. Come with me.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: Where are the Briarwoods?
Laura: Where are the Briarwoods?
Liam: You've got to do yes or no.
Laura: Are the Briarwoods--
Sam: -- in the palace?
Matt: (muffled moaning)
Liam: Yes or no.
Sam: Just nod or nod.
Laura: This is really smart. I feel good about this.
Travis: Should we take the rag out?
Laura: No.
Sam: He can do spells.
Liam: I just want to remind you that my friend over here can split you in half like an apple, right?
Travis: I nod his head yes.
Matt: (muffled murmur)
Liam: Have you seen the Briarwoods this week?
Matt: (affirmative grunt)
Liam: Do you like working for them?
Matt: (sounds uncertain)
Laura: Do they know we're here?
Matt: (affirmative grunt)
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Are they in the palace?
Matt: (sounds ambiguous)
Sam: Sometimes.
Laura: Do you know where they are?
Matt: (negative grunt)
Liam: Do they have pointier teeth than most?
Matt: (sounds ambiguous)
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: (sounds sad)
Sam: This is mumblecore.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Is your life worth giving a little information?
Matt: (affirmative grunting)
Liam: We want to know how to get into the palace without a problem. Got any advice?
Matt: (eager affirmative grunting)
Liam: Now I just want to remind you. He can take your head off, your knees off, your cock off, anything, in half a second.
Travis: I just give a little squeeze.
Liam: I'm going to pull the cloth out.
Sam: I cast Blindness on him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Don't know if he's blind.
Matt: Suddenly he goes (muffled panic noises).
Sam: Oh, he's blind. He's blind.
Liam: I give him a pat on the cheek.
Matt: (whimpers)
Laura: Oh, now I feel bad.
Liam: I'm a big fan of efficiency, so I'm going to pull this rag out and you've got about 30 seconds to start talking about something useful. Otherwise, my friend is going to make you about six inches shorter.
Travis: Yeah. I'm going to turn your head into a dreidel.
Liam: So we're going to start talking now, yes?
Matt: (grunts in agreement)
Liam: In three, two.
Matt: (gasping for breath) "Please don't kill me. I can show you a secret entrance into the castle. I know a way in."
Laura: It's not guarded?
Matt: "I don't think so. They've closed it off. If you can find a way through, they won't expect it."
Taliesin: Is it the one in the forest?
Matt: "There is one, yes, yes, in the forest. Look, I can bring you to their project room under the castle, what they're working on. Please don't kill me."
Laura: What is the project room?
Sam: Are they working on explosives?
Matt: "They've been-- They've been working on something. It's hard to describe. I've only been there once. It's beyond my interests, but it is part of the reason they even took this place."
Liam: Lord Briarwood is a vampire.
Matt: "Aye."
Liam: What the fuck is Lady Briarwood?
Matt: "She's powerful, I'll give you that. She scares me more than the two of them."
Laura: Is it hard to talk with no teeth?
Matt: "It's more difficult than expected, aye."
Travis: I start to tilt his head and I'm like showing us won't work, we need a location.
Matt: "It's under the castle. It's under the city. All the caverns are there. I can show you how to get there, I've been there. They've taken me."
Laura: Do you know what they've done to the ground here? Do you know why nothing grows?
Matt: "Stuff grows. It's how we do the farming."
Marisha: Stuff doesn't grow, though. Not like it should. What did they do to the land?
Matt: "I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with what they're doing under the castle."
Marisha: And what exactly are they doing under the castle?
Matt: "It's an excavation, or they're building something. I don't know the details of it."
Liam: You've no idea what they want?
Matt: "Comparatively, I'm just a peasant to them. I work with-- well, I worked with Kerrion."
Taliesin: How long have you worked with Sir Stonefell?
Matt: "Five years."
Taliesin: Were you here when he took the castle?
Matt: "Yes, yes. I was part of the incursion."
Taliesin: Good. You're very lucky. Because you're going to live if you show us-- And I bring out a map.
Sam: He can't see anything.
Taliesin: I know. Drop the Blindness.
Matt: He hears the crinkling of paper.
Taliesin: Drop the Blindness.
Sam: All right. I drop Blindness and I drop Seeming.
Matt: (scared, fast breathing)
Taliesin: Look at me. Look at me. You're going to show me where on the castle is the secret entrance. Do you know who I am?
Matt: "No."
Taliesin: You will. Mark it on the map.
Matt: He looks down at his bound arms and legs.
Travis: I take his head and I shove his nose and his face right above the map. And I say: use your nose.
Matt: "It's right--" He spits and puts a little droplet. It's loosely in the area of the western side of the mountain that the castle is built on. Roughly around the entrance where you escaped when you and Cassandra left Whitestone, five years before.
Taliesin: I know where that is.
Travis: That means we don't need you anymore.
Matt: "No! I can show you-- I can show you where their project is. The tunnels. You need me."
Travis: He'll set a good trap.
Laura: I just want to ask, when do the Briarwoods come out?
Matt: "Not often. They don't need to. Kerrion does the work for them. Did the work for them."
Sam: Those giants. Who controls them?
Matt: "Lady Briarwood does. She's the one who made them."
Travis: It's all over the room.
Marisha: She's the one who made them?
Taliesin: Can I propose something to you?
Matt: "She's strong with necromancy, she is."
Liam: I shove the rag back in his mouth for a moment.
Taliesin: Mark his face, take his tongue, let him loose.
Sam: His eyes, too?
Taliesin: No, just his tongue.
Travis: His tongue?
Taliesin: Mark his face.
Travis: I stick my two fingers inside of his nose, crank back on his nose, reach in, and rip his tongue out of his mouth.
Sam: I cover Keyleth's eyes.
Taliesin: That was a bit more than I was--
Travis: You said take his tongue! That's a natural 20.
Marisha: Natural 20?!
Taliesin: Natural 20, really? I'm feeling like such a bastard right now.
Matt: There isn't even a slow scuffle. You just reach in and (wet ripping noise, pained scream) You immediately jam the cloth back in. The cloth begins to slowly soak with blood. You hold almost a pound of muscle: a now motionless tongue in your hand, bloody at its base. These tears are running down his face. (muffled sobbing and coughing)
Travis: Is that good enough for your message?
Taliesin: I take my gun. I'm going to shoot it very gently-- I'm going to shoot into the ground to muffle the sound. I'm going to take the heat of it, and I'm going to cauterize it. His tongue, so he doesn't bleed out.
Matt: You pull the cloth out. (pained cry and choking sounds)
Taliesin: I'm going to mark his head with the still-hot gun.
Matt: (noises of pain) He starts screaming in pain as you're burning what into his head, the symbol of the de Rolo family?
Sam: It's a very complicated symbol. (laughs)
Taliesin: I'm going to do it. And then, I say we let him run out the front door and we set fire to the house.
Travis: I'm good with that. I've got this.
Sam: Where are we going after this?
Marisha: Whoa!
Travis: No. I like that a lot.
Marisha: You would, though. You would.
Sam: Trinket's downstairs. We should leave Trinket.
Travis: Have we forgotten that this entire town is full of evil, undead vampire people?
Marisha: Have we also forgotten that this entire town is looking for us?
Taliesin: They don't know we're here.
Marisha: They will after we set fire on the house and send a man screaming through the street with your symbol on his forehead.
Sam: They don't know where we live.
Marisha: They will! They're going to go, "Hm, let's look at the burning smokestack of a house and start there."
Taliesin: He's going to be missing by morning. They're going to know.
Travis: We've got the guy painted all over this room. They're going to find out one way or the other. Might as well do it with a little showmanship.
Sam: We're trying to make everyone know that we're here.
Taliesin: We're trying to start a rebellion.
Marisha: (voice cracking) Yeah, but-- yeah.
Travis: Come on, be the Mockingjay, Keyleth!
Taliesin: (giggles) Don't make me laugh. This is dark shit.
Travis: It is!
Sam: We can stay the night before we release him and burn it down.
Taliesin: Fair.
Sam: Although there are a bunch of guards around.
Marisha: We can't stay the night.
Laura: We can't stay the night.
Sam: All right, just burn it, then. Let's get out of here.
Marisha: Hang on. Fellow half-elves, you look as horrified as I feel. What do you guys think?
Laura: I feel like it's a little stupid, since we have nowhere to go.
Sam: We can go back to our old hideout. We have the tavern. No one's found it.
Liam: Percival, I know what you've been through, to an extent.
Taliesin: I don't even know what I've been through, to a certain extent, but yes.
Liam: We came here to wipe out a scourge on this city. Careful lest you become the scourge you've come to destroy. These people have eaten shit for five years. I'm not saying that man was innocent, but he's had a hard road. Everyone here has had a hard road. I am maybe willing to overlook what's just happened for all the hardship you have had, but careful how you are walking.
Sam: Hey, wait a second here, Vax. That was an enforcer. He kept the people oppressed. He worked for the Briarwoods and punished all of these farmers for not bringing enough taxes and enough tithes.
Liam: Are we to turn into Jack the Ripper because of it?
Sam: Well, that's what a rebellion is.
Travis: I do like ripping.
Taliesin: There's no pretty way to do this.
Laura: I'm fully in support with burning down a house, I just feel like it might backfire a bit.
Marisha: Look, I agreed to start a rebellion and let the people have their uprising, but I'm with Vax. I was trying to tell you this before we even came here, Percy. You don't want to become the thing that you are so desperate to seek vengeance on. How are we any different than the Briarwoods, at this point?
Travis: We're not fucking vampires. Look, what are our options besides burning the house down? I'm open to other ideas.
Sam: We can just leave it as a symbol of our terror.
Taliesin: I've marked him. I'm willing to walk away.
Travis: And where do we stay?
Sam: Somewhere else.
Travis: The tavern? Do we have to find another building?
Taliesin: I know a barracks. It's not too far away.
Liam: I agree with you, with burning the house down. Let's find anyone who's in here and get them out.
Taliesin: I think they'll get out when the house catches on fire.
Liam: Your soul doesn't need to be forfeit, Percival.
Taliesin: (sighs heavily) Things are more complicated now.
Sam: Percy, is that last barrel for you?
Taliesin: No. But, if it was, would I tell you?
Sam: No.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: Why are things more complicated, Percy? Clearly, we all just witnessed what just happened.
Taliesin: That was unexpected.
Marisha: Yeah, no, I'd agree with that, yeah.
Taliesin: (sighs) That's a longer conversation.
Sam: These guards aren't going to stay out for long. We should set fire and get out of here.
Liam: We burn the house down, and we find a place to hole up for the night.
Laura: Hey, buddy. How's it going?
Matt: He looks over at the body of Sir Kerrion, which is still slumped against the wall.
Liam: Percy, we need to have that longer conversation soon.
Laura: Soon, but not now. Let's go.
Marisha: Let's get out of here. All right, we're setting this damn house on fire?
Laura: Let's do it.
Travis: I take the tongue-less one, and I throw him out. I keep him bound. He's bound amongst the chest and hands. And I throw him out the window. Bye, motherfucker!
Matt: He falls out into the rain, (boof) falling on his side. (whimpers) He's being rained on, and he's trying to struggle with his bindings.
Travis: He'll get up. His feet are free. His legs and feet are free. I'm picturing chest and arms.
Matt: Okay, then he gets to his feet and starts running.
Sam: Grog, can you carry this unconscious guard out on our way out?
Travis: Sure. Do I kill him first?
Matt: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body?
Sam: Sir Kerrion's body?
Matt: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body to burn with the house?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Are we?
Taliesin: Let's take him, too.
Travis: We might as well leave him out on the front step, or something. I'll grab Sir Kerrion--
Sam: Can you carry both of those fuckers?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: He threw one of them out.
Sam: No, there's the unconscious guard and the body.
Travis: I'll grab unconscious guard and the body.
Liam: He weighs like 600 pounds.
Marisha: I'm going to say  All right. Well, if we're going to light this damn house on fire and make it a symbol--
Sam: You have fire hands.
Marisha: We're at least going to make it cool and make it the message that it's supposed to be.
Travis: There you go!
Marisha: I turn into an eagle and I fly to the roof.
Matt: Flying out the window that you just shattered.
Marisha: Give me your symbol.
Taliesin: I give her one of the parchments.
Matt: You fly up. The rain is coming down on you. It's a little hard to fly. You get up to the top of the roof.
Marisha: I cast Flaming Sphere.
Matt: You transform into yourself again?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: We're all going to start going out the way we came.
Travis: I throw unconscious guy and Sir Dead.
Marisha: Hope you guys were ready to get out.
Laura: I open up a bottle of wine and take a giant swig.
Matt: Okay. As you guys head back down to the cellar?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You guys all head back down to the cellar. You throw them both out the window, including the body of Sir Kerrion (boof) out into the yard. You head back down into the cellar.
Marisha: I cast Flaming Sphere, and I start moving it around on the roof and start drawing the shape of the de Rolo family crest on the roof.
Matt: Okay. It will take you a few minutes. You now see, as you're finishing the symbol, Vouk running to the front of the building, and you hear the voices of two guards going, "Master Vouk? What happened? Tell us. Unbind him!" "Yes, sir." And the two guards at the front of the building are talking with him. You finish the symbol.
Marisha: And I take my Flaming Sphere, and I throw it right at the feet of where the guards are.
Matt: Okay. You're on the roof, so you don't see them, but you know they're off to the side of the roof, so you can roll it off the roof down to them. They both freak out and react and seem to get into a defensive position. They start arming themselves, and you hear crossbow bolts being set into place.
Marisha: I run over to the edge where the cellar was, and I go, (whispering) Grog. Grog!
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispering) Come to the side of the roof!
Matt: You guys make your ways back down through the cellar, where Trinket's waiting patiently. (bear grunts)
Laura: Hey, buddy. Let's go.
Travis: Hi, Trinket. Get out.
Matt: You guys come out of the cellar now.
Marisha: (whispering) Grog! Hey!
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispering) Catch me!
Travis: Okay!
Matt: Catch Keyleth. You guys are now out in the open, still during the day, rain pouring down.
Laura: Running toward the woods? Where are we running?
Marisha: Get the fuck out of here.
Taliesin: Let's head back to the inn. Let's try the barracks. We'll try the barracks.
Matt: The barracks are attached to the castle.
Taliesin: Shit. Okay.
Sam: Back to the tavern, then.
Taliesin: Back to the tavern for now.
Laura: They're going to notice--
Matt: Stealth check real fast, guys.
Marisha: I was going to say, do you have Pass Without a Trace, can you summon any more spells?
Laura: I don't. I mean, I can cast it right now.
Matt: If you want to quickly, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, before we move.
Matt: Stealth checks?
Sam: 19.
Liam: Did we get the Pass Without a Trace?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: So, plus ten, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: 34.
Taliesin: 20.
Marisha: 25.
Travis: 21.
Laura: 24.
Matt: Sure enough, both guards rush around the corner. You guys have already leapt over the fence. However, they see the fence. "The fence is bent!" And they go rushing toward that direction. You guys have already disappeared into the various alleyways, making your way back towards the inn in the center of town.
Laura: Pass Without a Trace, I mean, Dust of Tracelessness.
Travis: Okay, yeah, just throwing it down behind us.
Matt: Okay. They're giving chase. They're hearing the sounds of your footsteps a little, but eventually their sounds fade. You do hear in the distance a bell start going off.
Taliesin: We're going to go into the basement.
Matt: You start seeing people emerging from their homes, hearing the bell. And, you would know this, this would be a warning bell for whenever a fire breaks out in the city. You see smoke beginning to rise up, even through the rainstorm. The fire is fighting the rain. But the smoke is black and it's starting to fade. You gather the building itself did not catch fire enough to burn into rubble due to the rain, but you've probably left a very visible mark on the roof.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Matt: People begin to gather from the outside, and you see folks running past the alley as you make your way back to the tavern that you currently have as your base of operations. You all make your way in safely from the rain. Take a deep breath and come to understand that you've definitely started the motion of whatever it is you're intending to do. We'll see how it plays out in the near future. We'll call the session there for the night.
Travis: Shit got hairy.
Taliesin: That was amazing.
Laura: That was dark, you guys. Super dark.
Sam: I found seven gold.
Taliesin: I have a sword, now.
Travis: It's October.
Marisha: Speaking of Percy and his crazy storyline--
Taliesin: So that's about to happen, yeah.
Marisha: I'm guessing by now if you go on the Geek and Sundry website, you can find his playlist.
Taliesin: Music to burn a house to. Music to violently murder people to.
Marisha: I was gonna say, music to murder to. Go check it out, it's great.
Taliesin: Music for a midnight murder. There we are. Actually, I have some art that I would love to-- can I put on the--
Matt: Yeah, sure.
Marisha: Taliesin art.
Taliesin: Yeah, I drew pictures. Just in case everybody wants to see, this is the terrible thing we keep carving into people and things.
Marisha: Or burning on rooftops.
Taliesin: And then this is actually the de Rolo family crest. Just another fancy thing.
Matt: Very, very cool, and well done, sir.
Taliesin: Thank you. I drew a picture. So that shit happened.
Marisha: Glad I'm not the only one who thinks you're crazy anymore.
Taliesin: I think I'm crazy now. It's gonna be interesting.
Marisha: You're all crazy, we've all seen it. Now we can handle it as a family.
Zac: Yeah, y'all's fucked up.
Taliesin: That got way darker than I was expecting.
Zac: Yeah. I'm sure that won't have any negative repercussions whatsoever.
Matt: No.
Taliesin: I hate you, Matt.
Laura: Hey, man. Did we hit 10k?
Zac: Yep. (cheering)
Zac: 10,060. Currently Starburns is winning.
Marisha: Starburns! Do it!
Taliesin: Starburns! Do it!
Zac: Here's what they forget  Jess and Steph are the ones doing it. If anyone's watched Jess and Steph's craft show, it will most likely end up being just a shaved face. If you think Jess and Steph can pull off Starburns, you're lying to yourself, and it will just end up being a clean shave.
Taliesin: I got a straight razor, we could go for this. You trust me, I mean, you know. I can get in there.
Zac: Moving on.
Taliesin: I can Sweeney Todd that.
Zac: Okay, so. Tonight, guys, we're just gonna be reading off the names and we're gonna knock through 'em pretty quick.
Matt: We're trying to keep time down for weeknights. All right, guys, so we have donating tonight to Extra Live, we have Connor Brown, Steven Sudeban Davis, Ravi Persuad, Mitchell DeFow-- sorry if I ruin any of these names, guys, by the way-- Tom Revely, Caleb Popum, Michael Holloway, George Rinn, PumpkinSpiceThisBitchTheFourth, Anonymous Donator, we have Patrick Toro, the Lost Tigers, Rebecca Case, Lewis Letter, Emma returns, Emma Engquist, I hope I'm not ruining that too bad, Pernil Ilfsen-- that's a cool name-- Arthur Gibbs, another wonderful anonymous donator, Maxine Poloquin, another great anonymous donator, Christian Huntlee, James Bell, John Reap, Killer Penguin, Monica Dahl, Kayla Ernest, Tim Pearson, another great anonymous donator, PumpkinSpiceThisBitch twice more--
Zac: Well, one's the original and one's the second.
Matt: Oh, it carried over, I see. I see. The original and the second. There's a third one in there, probably. Guys, thank you so much. It's really incredible, each one of you that donated to help Extra Life. We really appreciate it.
Zac: Since this weekend is the 24-hour Nerdist Extra Life stream, starting next week we'll go back to 826LA and get those donations rolling back in for 826--
Marisha: But in the meantime, don't forget to go to LA2050 and vote for 826LA so they can win 100k.
Zac: I would also like to throw out there the other-- it currently looks like it's a race between Starburns, Freddie Mercury, and Fu Manchu.
Laura: Oh, I like Freddie Mercury.
Taliesin: Starburns' really kinda rocking it for me.
Marisha: I was gonna suggest-- we had the Hunger Games reference, so what was his name? Kerrion or whatever? The Gamemaster in the first one?
Zac: There is no way Steph and Jess have the ability to do something like that.
Matt: I almost wanna see the tristache. Tristache is when you shave the handlebar, and then a smaller handlebar, and then a smaller-- (laughter)
Zac: Poll's out. The poll's out, dude.
Sam: Is the Hitler on the poll at all? (groaning)
Taliesin: You're a terrible person! That is the worst thing I've heard yet.
Sam: The Charlie Chaplin.
Zac: We also have a video to show you guys from a community member about their own D&D Extra Life stream they're doing this weekend, so we are going to show that to you guys here once you guys sign off, so.
Matt: Fantastic, thank you so much.
Zac: Stick around tomorrow for Jess and Steph's birthday, where they cut my fucking face up. (cheering)
Matt: That's gonna be worth its own weight in gold. Well, all right, guys, we'll be back next week for our special Halloween episode of Critical Role. We'll see how the story progresses darker and darker down this hole of horror and moral conundrum. (laughs) I'm excited. I hope you are too. Once again, guys, thank you all so much. Our love to the Team Hooman, Critter crowd out there, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week.
Travis: Damn straight!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice, play Dungeons and Dragons, and Liam once again throws curses at me right before we start the stream. It's good, it's good.
Liam: I love you.
Matt: I love you too. Sam's on his way, he'll be here shortly.
Liam: Lies.
Matt: Hopefully. Possibly lies. He's a good liar, as we know. But we've got a couple announcements we want to get done before the show. First and foremost, as a reminder, we're all flying out to Portland tomorrow for Wizard World. (cheering)
Marisha: Getting on a plane!
Taliesin: I gotta pack a bag!
Marisha: Never unpacked it.
Matt: Looking forward to seeing you guys there tomorrow. We have a panel tomorrow and on Sunday-- Saturday. My week, it's been a long week. Saturday panel at 2PM, which will be--
Laura: On the main gaming stage.
Matt: Yup. Main gaming stage. Also available online at twitch.tv/wizardworld during our panel. It will be hosted there for you guys to watch, who can't be there in person.
Laura: And in case you forget, you can always follow Critical Role on Twitter, @criticalrole, and the panels will be posted there, I mean, the schedule, so you guys can find us. Or follow any of us for our individual signing.
Liam: We have a team of hundreds that man the Twitter handle with information.
Laura: Hundreds of twos, of threes.
Taliesin: Like Bond villains.
Liam: It's Marisha and I. (laughter)
Marisha: Mainly Liam. Mainly Liam.
Matt: Good use of henchmen, it works out well. So look forward to that. Also, we have going up, it should be on the store tonight--
Liam: Sam's here!
Matt: Sam's here. On the store tonight, Sam's here! He almost fell over. He made his dex save. Everything's through the filter nowadays. It's really bad. I have a serious problem. We have going up on the store tonight at Geek & Sundry, we have prints-- our Critical Role poster prints with characters. We also have--
Laura: A very limited run. It's very, very limited, signed by the cast, so those are-- I don't even know how many, but once they're gone, they're gone, so yeah, those will be available for a short amount of time. Buy it right now!
Marisha: Right now, on geekandsundry.com.
Laura: Sam, you look different tonight.
Sam: I do?
Liam: You look handsomer.
Sam: That is impossible.
Marisha: I do like your shirt.
Taliesin: It is a very nice shirt.
Sam: Hi guys, welcome to Critical Role, where we nerdy-ass voice actors like to roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons. Oh, and Liam just threw some curses at me right before we started. (laughter)
Matt: We already-- we already covered all this.
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Matt: It's okay, it's good. Redundancy is good in this industry. So, in that regard, also, we may be, I think we're supposed to have more "How do you want to do this?" shirts up. Supposed to be up soon?
Laura: Potentially soon. We're working on it. There's some really cool stuff coming. Really cool stuff.
Sam: We don't know what's coming, do we?
Matt: And also just a reminder to all of our friends over in the Europe area, me and Marisha will be guests at Kaizoku Con the first weekend of March, in Cork, Ireland, so we're excited to go and meet a bunch of Critters out there. Kaizoku. A Gaelic mythological creature, the Kaizoku. So, those are my base announcements, do we have anything else anyone wants to mention on the stream?
Taliesin: We have a thing. We got to announce a thing this week.
Matt: What did we get to announce?
Taliesin: We got to announce "Black Butler."
Matt: That's right! We have "Black Butler  Book of Circus," they announced the cast, where Taliesin, you play--
Taliesin: Well, I'm in "Book of Murder," two completely different butlers.
Matt: Right, it's a thing.
Taliesin: I'm buttling in "Book of Murder" as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, so that's exciting. It's the weirdest accent I've ever done. It is all over the place.
Liam: "Oh, hallo"-- (laughter)
Travis: Might beat that one.
Matt: In "Book of Circus," I play Joker. I'm excited to jump into that little realm there, so look forward to that.
Liam: We are in an intimate relationship with Wyrmwood Gaming and if you go to wyrmwoodgaming.com and use the code "critrole," "critrole," you will get free shipping on these beautiful boxes. They hold dice.
Laura: They hold dice, they are magnetic, so they stay closed, they hold your dice so well-- oh--
Liam: Enchanted by witches.
Matt: (laughs) That's a beautiful presentation, guys.
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: I'm proud of each and every one of you.
Liam: I went to NYU.
Matt: Hey, see.
Marisha: I dropped out.
Matt: Anything else? Cool. We're good? All right, let's dive into tonight's episode proper. So, last we left off, the party Vox Machina, having recently suffered their main city of Emon and one of their initial towns where they began their adventures in Westruun under attack from an entity called the Chroma Conclave, a collection of allied chromatic dragons, extremely powerful, ancient across the board, it seems, is wreaking havoc across all of Tal'Dorei. They managed to save a few allies, make a few current, tenuous relationships with the Clasp, and moved all of the refugees that they had been keeping within Greyskull Keep to Whitestone to keep them safe for the time being, as that town had seemingly been passed over by the dragons that are still heading east across the continent. After that, the party made their way to Vasselheim. Vasselheim, the distant city known as the Cradle of Faith, the oldest living beacon of civilization in the world that is currently known. After making their way there, the party made their way into the Guild of the Slayer's Take, where they had previously signed on after a trial and are members of, to seek more allies throughout the city of Vasselheim in hopes of preparing themselves to retake Emon, possibly Tal'Dorei at some point in the near future. That is where we left off. As you guys have spent some time resting within the actual-- we've got whispers going around over here already, and we haven't started.
Marisha: Do you want to say?
Sam: No.
Marisha: No thank you, keep going.
Matt: Okay. Two can play at that game. So, as you guys take a little bit of time, getting reacquainted with the Guild Hall of the Slayer's Take, setting your stuff down that you need to prepare for a short period of time staying in the city or longer if need be. You ran briefly into Mertin Cyndrial, the husband of Vanessa, who's the Huntmaster of the entire Guild, and had a brief conversation with Aldor, who was beating Thorbir at cards.
Laura: What a dick.
Liam: Love that guy.
Matt: He's a nice fella.
Laura: Not Thorbir, he's great.
Matt: There you go. Not very good with dice. So, that being the case, what would you guys like to do at this point in time?
Laura: I don't know, I'm just asking you guys.
Marisha: So we slept and we woke up?
Matt: You just arrived now, it's mid-dayish at this point. Early morning to mid-day.
Liam: Yeah, we slept at the Slayer's Take, we talked to Aldor for a minute, right?
Matt: You haven't slept, you've arrived, it's like morning, mid-day now. You've just situated yourselves in the Guild. You had an evening's rest before you came here. But you have used your 7th-level spell to get here.
Marisha: Yes. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matt: So what is the plan?
Liam: Is there one?
Taliesin: I'm, at this point, prepared for some decompression of some kind. No one can be expected to move at the speeds we've been moving at for the past week. Perhaps grab an early-morning drink and find out how much news has actually reached this town about what's happening out in the world right now.
Liam: That's a good idea, Percy.
Laura: We need to find Lady Kima.
Taliesin: That's actually an even better idea.
Sam: That's a fantastic idea.
Taliesin: Perhaps she will go to breakfast.
Laura: She's at the Temple of Bahamut?
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: That sounds right.
Sam: Percy.
Taliesin: Yes?
Sam: Can I just remind you, for no other reasons than to be helpful to you in the game and no other reason, that the black powder salesman lives here. Just throwing it out there, you might need some supplies.
Taliesin: It's interesting, because I sleep at night and these voices from nowhere consistently remind me that there's a black powder merchant in this--
Liam: What game are you talking about? We don't have time for games, there are dragons that need dealing with.
Sam: You're right. How silly of me.
Liam: Stick to music, please. We don't need games.
Taliesin: Kima, I think, is an excellent idea.
Sam: Kima is a great idea.
Matt: Last I heard, Victor was blown apart.
Laura: We also need-- oh.
Matt: You don't know.
Laura: We also need supplies.
Sam: Oh, yes. Hell yes. I don't have anything.
Laura: We need lots of potions, health potions.
Sam: Yeah, but they sell those here?
Laura: They sell health potions here. Yeah.
Matt: You've purchased them in the past.
Laura: Yeah, they sell them here.
Matt: Remember, that's where Grog had his fantastic bartering skills last time to acquire a few potions.
Travis: Yeah. I'm an investment banker.
Laura: That's right. Oh, that merchant might be here still. We have so many things to catch up on.
Marisha: We can also talk to the Slayer's Take as well.
Laura: We're just waiting for Vanessa and Zahra to get back from their hunt. Am I right?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Who? Oh, the wife?
Liam: Yeah, Merkel's wife.
Marisha: I didn't meet Zahra.
Laura: No, you didn't.
Travis: She's got a tail!
Laura: She's quite wonderful.
Sam: She's very powerful.
Laura: She's actually related to-- well, Percy, you would know.
Sam: She's related to Percy? I don't see the resemblance.
Taliesin: No, she's related to Lillith. They actually are, they are related, that is true. Our friend from previously.
Laura: Yes, our friend. From previously.
Taliesin: With that, let's find Kima, perhaps. That would be the best course of action.
Matt: So you guys are going to head towards the--
Liam: Do you think Kima wants to go potion-shopping? Maybe we should go get some shit and then see Kima? I think Kima would be a little impatient.
Taliesin: That may actually be a good point.
Laura: All right, all right, all right, all right. Let's go really fast. There's dragons in the world, we don't have time to shop.
Travis: Can you slam down an hourglass for shopping?
Liam: Sister, dear, how much coin do we have at the moment?
Laura: Well, not a ton.
Liam: How many Pop-Tarts do we have?
Laura: We have a lot of Pop-Tarts, but not very many gold pieces.
Liam: In the party, if anyone's holding coin, because I don't have much at all. I don't need much, but we do need healing potions.
Laura: I have enough in the party funds to buy some healing potions, so I think--
Taliesin: Is that including what we got from my sister?
Laura: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: Let's buy some potions.
Liam: You're in charge, let's go.
Matt: All right, as you guys heads towards the front door of the Slayer's Take Guild Hall, you're but feet from it before the door slams open as the cold winter wind comes pouring in.
Taliesin: Oh, that's right.
Matt: There, standing in the doorway, you see the outer frame of a strong female form, dark brownish-black leathers, you can see tousled dark hair, piercing pupil-less eyes, and there stands Huntmaster Vanessa, clutching a bag that's seemingly dampened at its base in her right hand as she steps into the main foyer, looking about all of you gathered in the front area. "Well, isn't this a nice surprise in the middle of the morning? Ah."
Laura: Welcome back.
Matt: "A pleasure to see you all. Ah, hold on. The rest of you, inside, where it's warmer." And as she steps inside, you see two individuals step out of the shadows behind her. One of which is another tiefling female, white hair, red in skin, and another individual, familiar to some of you: human, short brown shoulder-length hair, series of scars across his arm, carrying a shield and spear, as Kashaw and Zahra come in to accompany--
Travis: Get your ass in here!
Mary: Look what the bear brought in. Hello, darling.
Sam: Where do I go?
Will: I'm going to sneak through.
Mary: Hello. Have you gotten bigger?
Travis: Yeah. I've been lifting lots of horses and mules and stuff.
Mary: Oh, my goodness. Hello, darling.
Laura: Good to see you.
Mary: It's good to see you, too.
Laura: How are things?
Mary: I'm all right.
Taliesin: Once you're in, you're stuck.
Will: Hello.
Taliesin: Hello.
Sam: You said your name was Ka-SHAW?
Will: It's KASH-aw.
Laura: KASH-aw. Like cash. I like it.
Marisha: Hi.
Will: How are you?
Marisha: What are you doing here?
Will: This is kind of where I live. What are you doing here?
Marisha: Just, you know, rolling through. Passing by. Not much.
Will: Okay, who're--?
Mary: Kash, is that--?
Will: This is her, Z.
Laura: This is the guy?
Marisha: Vex, Vex, Vex! Vex, Vex, Vex, Vex, Vex!
Laura: What?
Marisha: I push Vex out of the way.
Laura: (laughs) You called me over to push me.
Marisha: Yes.
Will: You're Vex.
Laura: I am Vex.
Will: Oh, thank the gods. Yeah, he said you guys looked very similar and thankfully it's not too much, or I felt bad for you.
Mary: Yes, you do look very similar. Does that mean you're--?
Laura: He's my twin brother.
Mary: It's so lovely to meet you. I whack him with my tail.
Liam: Oh, jeez!
Laura: She does that.
Liam: You are impressive.
Will: You are a big-- I recognize you. Wait a second. I won 75 gold pieces at the Crucible when I bet on Kern the Hammer.
Travis: You did?! That was money well spent, my friend.
Will: Thank you for that night, by the way.
Travis: You're very welcome. These are my lackeys, I have a band of-- you know, wandering--
Marisha: Lackeys?
Laura: He doesn't realize that you bet against him.
Liam: I would not bring-- good to see you again-- I wouldn't bring that up.
Will: It was a wonderful fight, did you see it?
Travis: It was, did you see me power-bomb him at the end?
Mary: Hello Percy.
Taliesin: Lovely to see you again. It's been a complicated month, we'll get into it.
Mary: How are the weapons holding up?
Taliesin: Quite-- well, hmm. Liquefied, but mostly functioning. Hello, I don't think we've met. Percy Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III. And you are?
Will: Wh-what? Confused. Can you say that again?
Taliesin: Just call me Percy.
Will: Okay. Kashaw Vesh.
Sam: Scanlan Shorthalt.
Will: How are you?
Sam: It's nice to meet you. I've heard many a tale of your wit and bravery.
Taliesin: That Kashaw, oh! Yes, that one! Yes, of course.
Laura: We've heard so many things about you, Kash.
Will: Hopefully all good, thank you.
Travis: (laughs, then coughs)
Will: Is he choking?
Travis: I'm good.
Marisha: And you must be Zahra!
Mary: I am. And you are Keyleth, is that right?
Marisha: That's right, yeah, yeah.
Mary: You are beautiful, aren't you?
Marisha: (stutters)
Mary: Sorry.
Sam: I told her, I told her.
Mary: Yes.
Matt: At which point, Vanessa groans, staring at this display.
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Laura: Sorry.
Matt: "I hope this has worked out well for all of you, I however, have a bit of business of ours to finish, okay?"
Mary: Yes, we do.
Liam: Hey, what's in that bag?
Travis: Yeah, what'd you catch?
Matt: She walks up to the table where Mertin's standing, he reaches out to greet her, with arms extended. She throws it into his arms, he catches it, pulls it open. You see within there is a head of what looks like a humanoid head, but the skin is greyish and featureless. The eyes are whitish and milky. What hair is there, in wisps, is white in color. Who here is trained in arcana?
Mary: I think I am.
Sam: I am.
Matt: You know what this is.
Mary: I already know.
Matt: Roll an arcana check.
Laura: Why don't we ask you, then?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21. This is the head of a Doppelganger. This is a creature that spends a lot of its time infiltrating society, being able to take the form and shape of other individuals to assume their position, to take their wealth, to do all sorts of sometimes interesting or dastardly things.
Will: Made him a bitch to find.
Mary: Yeah.
Sam: It's a shapeshifter?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: What can you do with the head?
Matt: "Well, turn it in for the money it's worth. Spread the change and forget about it."
Taliesin: How do you know when you have one?
Sam: That's true.
Travis: And what was it posing as?
Taliesin: And at that point, don't you just already have one at that point?
Matt: "Well, this is for me to worry about. Not for you to care."
Laura: Vanessa, I have a question.
Matt: "Yes, please."
Laura: Do you ever hunt creatures just because they're evil and they're killing people?
Matt: "Generally, somebody will eventually be paying for such a creature to be hunted, so I do not feel the necessity to do it, without--"
Laura: What if lots of people are dying and you might be at risk as well?
Matt: "Then I think it should be very easy to convince someone to pay for it."
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: What if the cost is the end of the world?
Matt: "Well, I imagine that would be quite a terrible thing."
Marisha: Sure. That's what we're looking at here.
Mary: Really?
Laura: Okay, so. Vasselheim is unaware of what's going on, but a lot of cities have been destroyed.
Will: Cities. Multiple, cities? Have been destroyed?
Laura: Multiple cities. Emon was the first one hit.
Will: It's gone?
Laura: Well, it's still there technically, just crumbled.
Taliesin: And flat.
Marisha: And under rule by an ancient red dragon.
Mary: So much has changed since Lillith was there.
Laura: So much.
Mary: How did this happen?
Laura: He escaped. He'd been trapped in the fire plane, and--
Taliesin: We're not entirely sure what happened, but he escaped the fire plane and somehow created a coalition of chromatic dragons and they are ravaging the countryside.
Laura: Yes. Which is very strange.
Mary: What color?
Will: How many?
Laura: Red, white, green, black, blue was one of them at a time.
Marisha: They call themselves the Chroma Conclave.
Travis: Eight total.
Mary: The Chroma Concl-- there were eight?
Laura: There's four of them. There's four of them.
Marisha: No, you're-- you don't double them by city. It's just one city-- No, never mind. Just one dragon.
Travis: One, three, five, eight.
Matt: Vanessa's crossed her arms and thinks for a second and she goes, "Ah, if what you say is true, this is very unfortunate. And a bit larger than what our simple guild could even hope to really help. This would be something to take to the various temples."
Laura: Yes, and we plan on it, but we know that the Slayer's Take is full of very strong, very qualified fighters and we were hoping to have you at our side as well.
Matt: "Well. Let me put it this way. If what you say is true, multiple incredibly powerful ancient dragons roaming, destroying-- this is not something you can throw yourself at until eventually one or the other falls. You have to find a weakness, you have to find the way to be on their level. Ask around. See what other allies you can find."
Liam: Yes.
Laura: A metallic dragon.
Taliesin: Temple of Bahamut.
Liam: What you say is correct. These are the first moments after us finding out, this is a first step. But being members here and seeing what your people can do [no audio] I know this is just a first step, and we're about to enter Vasselheim proper, but--
Marisha: It should speak pretty loudly that we came to you first. That's how much we trust you.
Liam: Can we count on you?
Matt: (sighs) "I am Huntmaster of the Slayer's Take. I deal in contracts, I deal in business, I deal in the hunting of relatively unorganized creatures. This-- this is beyond me. That is not to say I would not be willing to help, but there are many things to consider first. Perhaps you should speak with Osysa."
Sam: What, who?
Matt: "Osysa."
Sam: Osysa?
Liam: The sphinx.
Matt: "Our patron of Ioun."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "She would have a better mind for this than me, this is..."
Laura: How do we talk to her?
Matt: "The same way you did last time."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Follow me."
Mary: Before we go, I believe we have a little settling-up to do?
Will: I'm cold and I still haven't been paid.
Matt: "My apologies. Mertin!" He's over there, he's currently putting the head into a small case and closing up and he goes, "Aye, not to worry I'll be more than happy to get this for you." And he leaves for a second, comes back, goes through the contract, reads a couple things. Pulls out a large chest and begins divvying up coin and throws a satchel to each of you that contains, for both of you divided for this contract that would come to 2,250 gold pieces.
Mary: Pleasure, as always.
Sam: They have more than we do.
Laura: No, they don't.
Mary: Thank you very much.
Matt: "Of course, that's what I'm here for!"
Mary: It was an interesting challenge, thank you. We had a rather good time with that one.
Will: Interesting trying to track it down, that's for damn sure.
Travis: What was it hiding as, by the way?
Mary: A plethora of different entities and beings, it was running around town changing at will.
Laura: Isn't that like that rakshasa you were talking about?
Marisha: It seems familiar, actually.
Will: Does sound familiar. That was interesting and bloody!
Marisha: Yup!
Matt: "Regardless... Shall we? Very well." And she begins walking further to the back of the guild hall, where you come to the same doorway that you previously entered with her before. The chains in the side, that sets up a large slab that leads to a staircase that leads to the subterranean area right beneath the Slayer's Take. You may have noticed it previously, but there is a structure above where the subterranean area is, behind the Slayer's Take. And it's-- it looks like a very simple temple. You haven't really gone into it, but as you step down into this dark area underneath you can see the sconces lighting along with you as you step into this dark cavern. As it opens up once again, you can see the remnants of this hidden temple to Ioun, the Goddess of Knowledge. And what's curious about this temple is Ioun is a goddess of knowledge and openness. One of her main astute pushes is the fact that knowledge is to be shared and spread, so it's curious to see that something of hers is hidden. There's probably a purpose to that. Pushing up the steps again, Vanessa puts her hand up and tells you all to stop and calls out again. "Osysa! I apologize to bother you, but we have a predicament that I believe requires your attention." As a moment passes, where once again you hear the low, rumbling growl in the shadows. (growls) You hear slams of giant footfalls across stone as what little bit of light torches begin to spark to life around the top of this platform, this stone platform. And at the very top of this staircase that leads to the top of where this platform ends, you can see standing above it a very large female sphinx with a lion body, a female head adorned with golden jewels around the neck, eyes that are light sky blue and white in color. Proud as these giant griffin-like wings stretch out and the entity comes to rest at the top, paws folded over the edge. "Yes, I recall. So what do you need of me?"
Laura: Well.
Travis: Yeah, go for it, Vex.
Laura: Your help, potentially. The world is under attack.
Matt: The head sinks for a moment. "I have been watching by the heartstone, naught but this past day I have been keeping tabs in hopes that such a cataclysm would not find its way to my mate. It has not. So. Being aware of this, what do you ask?"
Laura: Is there anything that you know of that could help us defeat these ancient beings?
Matt: She thinks for a second, steps up and closes her eyes. As her muscles tense, her eyes open again, that color flashing with this luminescent blue color. And her voice falls even deeper into her register, and almost has this monotone informative projection that says: "The Vestiges of Divergence, relics wielded when the gods walked and fought alongside their creations." The light fades from the eyes, for a second she catches herself and steps back.
Mary: May I ask, what are the Vestiges of Divergence?
Matt: She shakes her head. "I am a channel for this knowledge, but the best I can understand, they are old relics of the War of the Divergence. Leading into the penance, the Second Spark. These were armaments. Objects of great power that were used in these wars against the gods, good and dark. Many have been buried, entombed, lost, forgotten. The few that are recovered are passed on through blood lines, through symbols of power and of seats of great political importance. But the actual information is lost to me."
Laura: Do you know of any one in particular?
Matt: She concentrates for a second. "Not within my field of vision. Objects of this powerful enchantment are also prone to want to keep themselves hidden."
Laura: That's convenient.
Marisha: Osysa. If you are aware of this knowledge, then you know that Vasselheim is one of the only remaining cities still left standing. Are there any other services you can offer to help us fight this?
Matt: "The danger that you run here is that Vasselheim has stood the test of time and survived two possible ends of civilization as we know it. But it has survived both of these events because those who guard it stayed to guard it. You may be hard-pressed to convince others to step beyond the walls knowing that such a danger could use that to their advantage and destroy the greatest city that we know of. You are welcome to ask, but it will be a difficult journey. What I can offer, though: my mate is a keeper of much hidden knowledge, over on his side of Tal'Dorei. I may be able to send you to him to seek this information."
Laura: Much hidden knowledge?
Sam: About these Vestiges, perhaps?
Laura: Does he serve your same god? Or another?
Matt: "I am one of the chosen of Ioun. He does not serve her directly."
Liam: Information is welcome and we are thankful. And we have been impressed by your wisdom, very much so. The people you employ are chosen very carefully and very well and we all have been impressed. In addition to information, you provide a service with the Slayer's Take to Vasselheim. Do you have any interest in spreading that influence to Emon, if we can save it?
Matt: Her large paws cross once again, and she looks at you with a stern expression. "There is great danger and darkness in this world, and there are many fools who stand up in hopes that they can keep it at bay. If we were to lend our power to you, I would ask that you prove yourselves the ones that could carry this torch."
Liam: How so?
Matt: "Perhaps find these relics. Gather other allies. Prove to me that I would not be sending my people to their doom. Then return. Perhaps then, when you think you are ready, we could lend our guild to your service."
Laura: All right.
Marisha: And where does your partner reside?
Matt: She closes her eyes and concentrates for a moment. "South of the Frostweald, the mountain range that guards it." Her eyes open again. "Understand that it is our nature to present challenges. Part of his journey to seek him is to find him yourself. That is the first step."
Marisha: Does he have a name?
Matt: "It is his name to give."
Laura: One small question, Osysa, I'm sorry.
Liam: No, no.
Laura: You serve the goddess of knowledge, of openness.
Matt: And she steps back and you see the crystal sphere, the heartstone that she once helped you look through before to look back at the world, glows beneath framing light under her form. "Yes."
Laura: Does that mean you would know anything of the god of secrets: Vecna?
Matt: As you say that name, she snarls. (roars) "It would do you right to not mention that name in this place."
Laura: I apologize.
Matt: "Yes, I know of him."
Taliesin: His touch has been felt in the north.
Laura: Very close to here, actually. Would you know of a way to rid ourselves of his weapon, of his tool?
Matt: "If I did, we would have done so long ago. This creature is one of the few entities that shrouds my vision. The limits of our sight, of the things we seek to discover and unveil, are constantly balked by the veil of darkness he throws over the world. He may have been held at bay, many thought destroyed hundreds of years ago, but no, he stays. And he squeezes a stranglehold on everything we seek to accomplish."
Liam: Well then, allow us to do you a service. We have had dealings with his underlings. We have knowledge, which we freely give. Freely. If it does anything to help our case, winning your aid. And we will seek your partner and we will find your partner. We're not trying to score points, we are trying to do right. Percival?
Matt: "What do you know?"
Taliesin: Dark creatures attempted to, as best that we can surmise, open a gate beneath the castle of Whitestone.
Matt: "Whitestone." She steps back for a second, her eyes flare up with energy again. You can see the heartstone embedded in the floor of the stone glow even brighter and brighter as she puts her paws in the side and peers into it. She begins to mutter beneath her breath. "I can see the snowy north of Tal'Dorei, the castle. Beneath, one of our corrupted temples, forgotten long ago."
Taliesin: Your temples?
Matt: "The ziggurats were not of his construction. But he took them." Her eyes wince for a moment. Her head turns for a minute, her vision and face staring in the distance. "I look out to follow the anger, the swath of death and hatred. Those who took Emon, they draw my gaze. Something is happening."
Laura: Right now?
Taliesin: What do you see?
Matt: "The path to Westruun, eastward."
Laura: What's east of Westruun? Who has the map?
Matt: "Parts smoldering and left behind, the path continues over the Lucidian Ocean, eastward beyond the shores of Wildemount." Her head looks up, still staring off into the distance. "Into the Drimaulth Ravine. I see the floating islands of Draconia falling. Crumbling. Gone. An army sundered. People ruined. The Conclave, sated, returns towards your land once more." You can see blood pouring out of one of her nostrils now. The light dulls in her eyes and the heartstone fades for a moment. She gathers herself. "I peered too far beyond the veil that contains me, I'm sorry. My (pained grunt)--" She plops down and is breathing a little heavy.
Will: Can I heal you?
Matt: She takes a few steps down towards you. "Brother Kashaw. It would be appreciated."
Will: Puts his hand around the medallion. Closes his eyes. Puts his hand out, touches her.
Matt: "Thank you." She steps up and bows her head to you. She steps to the top of the temple once again. "I've seen this darkness you speak of under Whitestone, and I shall speak out to our brethren of Ioun in hopes of discovering the nature of this shadow. I'm sorry, I must rest."
Taliesin: Of course.
Liam: We thank you for your time. We are your willing allies.
Matt: "Return when you have proven yourself."
Mary: We shall.
Matt: "When you think this Conclave could possibly be felled beneath your weapons and might and will." She whips around the wings (whoosh) as the torches atop the temple flare out and you can see the edge of Osysa's form as she dives into the shadow to the back of the temple. You can hear the impact of giant footfalls against sand and then silence.
Liam: Zahra.
Mary: Yes?
Liam: You said, "We shall." Have we convinced you?
Mary: Knowing that there are four dragons, at least--
Laura: At least.
Mary: Four to eight dragons, according to Grog, out there. And after our dealings with Rimefang, I cannot let this go. You know I cannot, Kash.
Will: Z, this is fucking happy fun bunch over here. They bring death with them everywhere they go. This isn't our fight.
Mary: Not all of them.
Sam: I don't kill very much at all.
Will: Good to know.
Taliesin: Didn't you kill the king of--?
Will: Except for kings, all right.
Marisha: We just had a third-party perspective.
Sam: Yeah, I mean, she gave us a lot to "sphinx" about. (groaning)
Travis: Wow.
Sam: No? No?
Mary: It's nice to know Burt Reynolds is still around.
Matt: There's a very slow clap echoing into the cavern, as Vanessa goes-- (laughter)
Matt: "And to think, I might have briefly missed you." (laughter)
Laura: We should leave the temple.
Sam: Wait, did Osysa just tell us she could possibly send us to her partner?
Laura: She told us where he is, and we have to find him.
Sam: Oh, we have to make our way.
Will: You have to find the no-name guy who's going to help you find the stuff that's hidden that nobody knows where it is.
Laura: I thought we were finding the stuff that's hidden while we're finding him.
Mary: We will find her mate, he who is not named.
Will: Well, as long as it's not convoluted.
Marisha: He is south of the Frostweald, in the mountains.
Laura: I hate to thay this--
Liam: Yeth?
Mary: Speak freely.
Laura: So, these Vestiges are ancient, right? Spread across the land. Wasn't Tiberius looking for a bunch of objects of magic that his people had sent him to find? Perhaps that's the reason Draconia was hit. Maybe they were trying to hide these items.
Taliesin: It's possible.
Sam: That's a big "what if?"
Liam: Do you really think the Mending Wheel, though, would help us against Thordak?
Marisha: I feel like we'll know if it's an ancient Vestige of Divergence.
Taliesin: This is good. This is a path for us to walk.
Mary: So, Draconia is gone. Is that my understanding?
Taliesin: Well, most likely, yes.
Mary: What else is left?
Laura: Vasselheim. Whitestone.
Marisha: Zahra, Kash?
Laura: Potentially Syngorn, even though it's hidden.
Mary: Well, we can either stay here or we can--
Liam: They're opting out of the conversation.
Marisha: Have either of you been near Pyrah, in the mountains east of here? Have any of you been where the Fire Ashari reside?
Mary: I have not.
Will: No.
Taliesin: Going to have to make our way there, eventually.
Sam: A lot to do.
Laura: It's a lot to do.
Sam: Maybe we should split up into eight groups.
Taliesin: Actually, 11 groups.
Mary: That would be 12.
Laura: How many is that, Grog?
Travis: Four. (laughter)
Marisha: Do we know how far away the Frostweald is from here?
Matt: The Frostweald is back in--
Laura: By Westruun.
Matt: South of Westruun.
Marisha: Like where we started, right? In Stillben.
Matt: That was where you got the heart of the nymph.
Marisha: That's not far from the Air Ashari, correct?
Liam: Do you think she's still there, Grog?
Travis: Oh yeah, trust me. When you have Grog-- you never leave?
Liam: Yeah, that's the expression, I'm pretty sure that's the expression.
Laura: We need to find Kima, we need to go to the Temple of Bahamut.
Sam: Yes, you're right, yes.
Laura: Talk to people that are capable of helping us.
Liam: We need Kima. Potions first. I don't want to bore Kima, then Kima. Yes?
Laura: Hey, does the Slayer's Take have potions we can just have? Don't they have like a supply room?
Liam: It would be welcome.
Matt: "We have things we can provide, as you are members."
Laura: Oh good, yes.
Matt: "Mind you, not extremely active members as of late, but..."
Laura: But we will be. Think about the giant amount of claws and teeth and eyeballs and leather wings and scales.
Liam: We're about to get really fucking active.
Laura: We're going to be so fucking rich.
Mary: Think of the armor I could forge you from red dragon parts.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Liam: Can I give advantage if I go like this the whole time?
Matt: No. That's closer to disadvantage. (laughter)
Laura: Oh, how about 12?
Matt: "Yes, I'll provide you with what we can. Come with me."
Marisha: Aw, she likes us.
Laura: No, I could have gotten something really badass if I had rolled better.
Matt: So, you guys step up and you lead back to the Slayer's Take guildhall. She snaps at Mertin, whispers something in his ear, and he comes and offers a small chest to you guys that contains two potions of healing and one potion of greater healing.
Laura: Oh good, two potions! Vanessa--
Liam: It's welcome, it's very welcome. Which way is the potion shop from here?
Matt: "Go to the Quadroads."
Sam: Quadroads, of course.
Liam: Yeah, we haven't been here--
Laura: In quite a while--
Taliesin: As you know.
Matt: "I'm afraid your symbols have been getting dusty."
Laura: Grog.
Travis: Hm?
Laura: You don't have any potions left?
Travis: No, I've got like, three potions.
Laura: Who doesn't have any potions?
Sam: None.
Liam: None.
Marisha: Yeah, I have a couple.
Liam: Hey, I'm squishy as hell, can I have one?
Laura: You get the greater one. You get one, and you get one.
Taliesin: All right.
Mary: May I speak with Vanessa very quickly?
Matt: "Zahra, what can I do for you?"
Mary: Kash, come with.
Will: Kash walks over with her.
Mary: Vanessa, we've done many jobs together. And I think we've been very loyal to you. We've brought in a lot of money for you. My only request is, is there anything extra? Are there any spare potions, any amulets of protection, anything? You know this is going to come to us.
Matt: "And there is a lot of great money that you've made that could pay for these things."
Liam: (whispers) But her voice is so deep!
Matt: "I've given you already more than I needed to. You can afford it. If you were broke and asking me, maybe I'd be happy to ask, but I just paid you quite a sum of money."
Mary: I know you did.
Matt: "I feel like I'm being taken advantage of."
Will: That's not what we mean, you know that, come on. Just give us free stuff. (laughter)
Mary: I meant no offense whatsoever. I mean you no offense.
Matt: "And none is taken. However, I would say, there is business to be had deeper in the city. You wish potions, there are those that purchase them. I've already given you what I have and what you've earned."
Mary: And we thank you for that.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: Thank you, Vanessa.
Liam: Vanessa, hey. I'm not asking anything. We're going to get you into Emon. That's a promise.
Matt: "I look forward to you coming back and proving me wrong."
Liam: We're going to double your fucking business.
Laura: Mm, we're going to bring you so many scales. You just wait.
Matt: (deadpan) "I've never heard this before." (laughter)
Matt: "I've never been disappointed by it, either. In all sincerity..."
Sam: "... leave." (laughter)
Matt: "The gnome speaks because I do not have to. But good luck, and don't stray too far. Stay safe, please? I put a lot of faith in you."
Sam: All right, to the potion shop. To the Quadroads.
Laura: Wait, oh, wait! One thing. I know we're going.
Liam: Mirrors.
Mary: (laughs) No! (clears her throat)
Sam: I attempt to read lips.
Laura: Is Lyra around? Anywhere?
Matt: As you say that, you hear a voice in the back of the room go, "What, is she?!" You see Aldor in the back table, he's already up with his bag, ready to run. (laughter)
Matt: "Aldor, sit down, it's okay. Ah, not at the moment, she's currently helping her uncle."
Laura: At the place where he is.
Liam: In town?
Sam: The place where we got a lot of stuff.
Mary: We got the horses last time.
Matt: "He's the ambassador."
Laura: Cool. Thank you.
Will: As they're leaving, can Kash pull Zahra aside really quickly? Are you going with them? Seriously?
Mary: What do you want to do, do you want to stay here while the world burns?
Will: Yes.
Mary: Why?
Will: Because we're here. It's warm, we make money.
Mary: Not if nothing's left to protect. Not if there are no monsters left. If these things get out, if they spread their fire across the globe, what's left for us?
Will: If, if, if. If any of the monsters we miss went out and spread-- the world's always ending, baby!
Mary: They just took out Draconia, darling. All of it. Gone.
Will: I'll follow you. Anywhere. You know that.
Mary: I know. And I'll follow you.
Will: Tell me what you want to do and I'm there.
Mary: For a while.
Will: Let's go.
Mary: If we don't like it, we'll leave. If we find something better.
Will: We'll leave. Okay. Leave half the gold here. They don't need to know everything that we have.
Mary: Fuck that.
Will: All right.
Mary: We might need it.
Will: Then hide half the gold. I don't trust the twins as far as I can throw them.
Laura: I can read your fucking lips.
Will: Apparently she reads lips. (laughter)
Mary: Oh yes, I'd forgotten that. All right. She knows how much we have. We're going for a while.
Will: Was I wrong, by the way? Did you see how hot Keyleth is?
Mary: She's fucking hot.
Will: That's what I'm saying. Let's go, we should go.
Liam: We're so nice!
Laura: We're so nice!
Liam: What the fuck is that about?!
Matt: All right, so you guys head out of the Slayer's Take guildhall into Vasselheim, which is now a little more bustling than it was when you arrived. It's about midday. The sun is still not visible. There's enough cloud cover where you can see where it would be in the sky, but it's still pretty grey. No rain, and there is still relatively recent snow that covers most of the city streets, some of which has been pushed to the sides to make walkways easier. It's been snowing here in the winter rather often, as you two are both very aware. You have multiple things you want: the potion shop, there's the Platinum Sanctuary, I think last time you mentioned the Trial Forge.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: What do you guys want to do?
Laura: Potions first.
Matt: All right. So you make your way to the Quadroads.
Laura: Can I pull him aside as we're walking there?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: And ask, so, I thought you were interested in Keyleth. Am I wrong? I mean, you're interested in Keyleth. Right? I mean, I know you don't want to tell me. I know you don't tell me anything like this, but-- is it weird that he's here?
Liam: No, he's fine. And I am.
Laura: Okay. Should I take him out?
Liam: No!
Laura: Because I can.
Liam: No, he's--
Laura: Destroy him.
Liam: He's useful. And I don't hold anything against him, and she's-- why wouldn't he want her? Of course he does.
Laura: Yes, yes, yes, Keyleth is so! Fucking! Beautiful! I get it.
Liam: Well, so are you, but what the fuck am I going to do with that? Jeez, you're fucking weird. And I walk off. (laughter)
Taliesin: Now we're getting somewhere.
Matt: Coming back to the center of the Quadroads, you guys have been here before. This is where the center of the city's trade happens. Imagine the central Abdar's Promenade of Emon, as it once was, but condensed. And it is just hovels and tents and all these open shops that are crammed in this heavy space. It looks like the-- what's it, from "Hellboy II"--
Will: Underground mall. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Laura: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matt: Wall to wall buildings, but people, not weird creatures. People shouting, people are-- get some proper audio for this, one second.
Laura: Fresh fish!
Mary: Fresh fish!
Matt: Exactly. So as you guys are walking around, you eventually find your way up to the same area where you found the potions from before. You can see him there, he's wearing an open red vest that falls to the ground behind him, arms are revealed, he has these thick bracers on that are really finely scrolled with brass. He's got a fine Van Dyke beard going on now. He's currently speaking with someone off to the side. "Yes, of course, I'm more than happy to, yes. You! I remember you. Oh, it's been quite some time--"
Laura: You!
Matt: "Step on over here, sir, I would love having more--"
Laura: I push Grog out of the way.
Travis: What, hey! What?
Laura: You.
Matt: "Yes, can I help you?"
Laura: You sneaky mother-- Is he the one?
Travis: What?
Laura: Is he the one haggled with you? The one you traded all of our--?
Travis: I got a really great deal!
Matt: "He got a fantastic deal the last time. He's a grade A customer. I'm sorry, is there a problem?"
Travis: Nope, no problem at all, you'll be doing business with me. (laughter)
Travis: Sit back, love, and watch a pro work.
Mary: Have we all walked into the store?
Laura: He's a cart-- he's a stupid cart salesman.
Taliesin: We're all going to learn something very valuable right now.
Travis: I don't know if you've noticed, but these twats below me need healing potions. Mm, whatever. Do you have anything like that on you?
Matt: "Hoo, hoo, hoo, do I? Do not worry, sir. Hold on just a moment." He disappears into the small tent opening behind him.
Laura: Keyleth, Hold Person or something to shut him up!
Liam: Yeah, I mean, it's funny, but we don't have that much gold.
Laura: We don't have anything.
Travis: (calls out) I've got 6,500 gold to spend and I mean to spend quite a bit of it.
Matt: "Music to my ears!" You hear from inside the tent, as he comes out with this long, very well-carved wooden-- looks like a test tube set, almost. There are all various potions of different sizes and colors. He sets it down. "So, potions of healing, you say." He pulls out a few of them. "This here I have, two superior healing potions..."
Sam: Ooh, nice.
Matt: "Three greater healing potions and ten regular potions of healing, at your disposal, should you require them. Mm, yes."
Liam: Grog, what about this? You are really strong and really good at killing things and my left-- left? Yeah. Nut still has a dent in it. You are really fucking strong.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: You are the best there is at what you do.
Matt: "And by far a handsome and intelligent salesman."
Liam: Please shut up. My sister is very good at-- do you know what math is?
Travis: Mathis? (laughter)
Liam: Vex'ahlia is very good at--
Laura: I don't even want to deal with this dick now!
Liam: She is an excellent shopper. I'm telling you, you know how you take things' skulls and turn them into like raspberry jam?
Travis: Yeah, like a paste.
Liam: Yeah, that's what she does with money. And I'm saying, we've had our differences, and I know you're stronger than me and I'm saying as strong as you are, that's as good as she is with shiny.
Matt: "And yet she was so abrasive when she arrived."
Liam: I say, shut up!
Matt: "Fine, hmph!"
Laura: Darling. You're lucky I don't-- Trinket? Have you seen my pet bear?
Matt: Trinket stumbles inside.
Laura: Quite adorable. He loves potion salesmen.
Travis: You know, I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I'm actually the current reigning champion of the Crucible. And with that title comes many things, like people that manage your shinies. I would like to introduce you to my shiny manager, Vex.
Matt: "This one, really?"
Will: Why was he holding your nut?
Laura: (laughs) No pressure now--
Liam: It was a little bit of pressure.
Travis: I didn't really hold it, it was like a flick.
Mary: A flick?
Laura: Look, I'm willing to trade you some very powerful magical items for some schmeasley little potions that heal people.
Matt: "How many would you like? What do you want?"
Laura: I want them all. How much?
Matt: "All of them?"
Liam: Bulk.
Matt: (chuckles) "Well, then. Let me do my math here." He looks through it. "All right, um..."
Will: By the way, as you're adding that up, I'd like to say you should tread lightly or I'm going to tell Vanessa and you'll have trouble getting anything from the Take ever again.
Matt: "The Take? Are you with the Take?"
Laura: Oh! Do you not see these-- These amazing--
Marisha: That's right, we get union discounts.
Matt: "Yes, there is indeed a discount with the Take (nervous laugh). They've been great representatives in the past, yes."
Laura: I like you more and more, Kashaw, every time you speak.
Will: Most people do. Ask Keyleth.
Marisha: (nervous laughter) What?
Matt: "With friendship discount, let me total this up a bit here."
Mary: I walk outside, and I--
Matt: "That will be 6,500 gold pieces for the lot."
Laura: I'm sorry, how much?
Matt: "6,500 gold pieces for the lot, with the discount."
Laura: Right.
Sam: So coincidental. That's exactly what Grog offered.
Travis: That's what I have!
Laura: How about, instead of that, I trade you--
Travis: (loud whisper) 7,000!
Laura: Thank you, Grog.
Liam: (whispers) Stick to the killing!
Laura: These magical items. And I pull out the knickknacks that I took from I don't fucking know where. It's knickknacks. But they're magic.
Taliesin: Is knickknack a candy bar?
Sam: Vex, no. You can't, you can't possibly trade that. It's too valuable. What are you doing?
Laura: Well, I know, but where else are we going to find a vendor--?
Sam: Those are the Knickknacks of Kaa.
Laura: I know, and they're quite valuable. But he said six thousand, six hundred and (mumbles) and we know this will cover that.
Sam: I can't. Please sir, please don't take advantage of us by taking these things from us. They're too valuable, please, I beg of you.
Taliesin: What have you pulled out?
Sam: The Knickknacks of Kaa.
Taliesin: The Knickknacks of Kaa?! No, not the Knickknacks of Kaa!
Laura: (worried sigh) Now I'm doubting-- No, you know what, maybe I shouldn't trade these.
Liam: Put them away, put them away.
Matt: Make a deception check. Make a deception check. I would say, you know, if you wanted to--
Sam: Am I assisting?
Matt: You can assist on this, yeah.
Travis: Oh, that's good!
Mary: I'll take some too, as well.
Laura: What is the assist?
Matt: That gives you advantage on the roll.
Sam: Oh wait, I don't get to roll?
Matt: Huh?
Sam: I don't get to roll anything?
Matt: No, it just gives her advantage.
Laura: 27.
Sam: (sighs) Oh, that's good.
Taliesin: That was a really good roll.
Will: (laughs) That was good.
Matt: He goes, "No, no, no, no. Put them on the table, please. I would like to have a look. Just in casies."
Laura: I'll put one of them down so you can look.
Marisha: As she places it down, can I do a little Gust cantrip and do a little poof of air?
Matt: Sure. Make a sleight of hand check.
Marisha: Fuck.
Laura: Aw, man. All the time, Keyleth!
Marisha: I know. Oh, that's good though, that's good. I'm good, I'm good. Hang on, let me make sure, make a sleight of hand--18.
Matt: 18? Okay. As you sit down (poof), this little like-- all the dust on the front, a little of the dampness is (poof).
Laura: I take my hand away, trembling, like I don't want to give it up.
Matt: "Hmm." He pulls out a little glass eyepiece, inspects. "The craftsmanship is decent."
Mary: And as he's doing this, I cast Thaumaturgy and cause the table to start vibrating.
Matt: What are the components on that?
Mary: It says I can cause minor tremors.
Matt: On the spell. What does it say under components?
Laura: Oh.
Liam: Knickknacks.
Laura: Knickknacks is probably the components.
Will: Components is "V."
Matt: Visual. Yeah, you don't have to actually do anything to it. It just happens.
Sam: Why did you even--
Will: Why not, is the question I want to ask.
Taliesin: Really quickly, while the Thaumaturgy is happening, I'm going to cast Minor Illusion, just go for it.
Laura: What is happening right now?!
Marisha: We're stacking the deck, man. We're stacking it.
Sam: Any one of these could fail.
Marisha: If they all succeed, it's going to be dope.
Taliesin: I'm going to make a-- the image of a beautiful woman briefly appear in the reflection of the object and then vanish. Just a gleam.
Marisha: That's hot. That's hot.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: You need to make a sleight of hand check.
Taliesin: I need to make a sleight of hand check?
Laura: Don't you fucking fail at this.
Liam: Roll that Snitch!
Laura: Natural 20.
Taliesin: No, but it is a 19.
Liam: Yeah, gang.
Matt: Okay. So you set down which one of the knickknacks now?
Laura: Just one of them.
Matt: Which one?
Laura: Are you asking me as Matt?
Matt: These things that you pulled out of the--
Will: She puts down knick and holds knack.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: You literally said I gathered up a bunch of knickknacks worth 750 gold.
Matt: Oh, from that. I'm sorry. (laughter)
Matt: I thought you were talking about the tea set and the dominoes.
Laura: No, no, no, literally shitty-ass knickknacks.
Matt: Got you.
Marisha: No, we wouldn't be handing that shit over.
Matt: I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
Liam: This is like matryoshka nesting dolls. (laughter)
Marisha: Faberge eggs.
Matt: So what this is, it's like a really, really intricate inkwell that has been made out of gold and bronze. It's stuff you find in a SkyMall, essentially.
Sam: The Pocket Fisherman!
Taliesin: This is Sting, from Lord of the Rings.
Mary: The One Ring to rule them all.
Liam: That bass is singing!
Matt: All right, so. As the gust of wind fades, the table begins to shake, and he glances in across the outside of this inkwell amongst a bunch of other random knickknacks scattered around it. He looks at it for a second, this flash in his eyes. He goes, "Hmm. They seem fair enough. I would say, include these in the transaction, I would be willing to drop the cost by about 500 gold pieces? An even 6,000."
Laura: Darling. I snatch it away and say, do you have any idea how much these are worth?
Matt: "I do, actually, I'm quite the appraiser. It's part of my business."
Laura: I know when somebody's trying to swindle me, darling.
Matt: "Well then, step away. You don't need my business, obviously. Is this how your 'Shiny Manager' deals with your shinies? Or would you wish to deal with this face to face?"
Laura: Tell you what. Take two thousand off your asking price and we have a deal.
Matt: "That is ridiculous! No."
Will: How's your family?
Matt: "What does that mean?"
Will: Just curious how everybody's doing? Everybody healthy, happy?
Travis: Yeah, are they well? In one piece?
Mary: Have you seen your wife?
Matt: Make an intimidation check. (laughing) With advantage because she's helping. (laughter)
Will: Is that a 20?
Matt: Roll a d20 twice and take the higher of the two. Add your intimidation.
Taliesin: Roll again.
Will: 19.
Taliesin: Yay! Wait, wait, no. What's your--?
Will: Plus intimi-- 18.
Sam: Negative one intimidation.
Will: He's a human cleric, I'm doing my best.
Liam: Laughter during a game, what a novelty!
Matt: "Um. They're fine. Uh, quite fine. Yes. A thousand gold? Off the asking price?"
Laura: Two thousand gold off the asking price.
Matt: "That-- that's ridiculous. It's not even-- what are you--"
Will: Have you heard him talk about paste?
Matt: "I-- 1,300 off the asking price. Nothing more."
Liam: I take one of my daggers.
Sam: Oh, Jesus.
Liam: And looking at him, I stick it in Grog's arm and I drag it down and I never take my eyes off him.
Travis: Neither do I.
Taliesin: He has a lip collection.
Matt: He's looking, like, over you guys now, towards the thoroughfare.
Laura: Looking for guards.
Matt: "Ah, um. Perhaps, uh--"
Travis: Keep your voice down.
Matt: "I would need..."
Liam: There's no magic here, friend.
Matt: "Um."
Laura: Fifteen hundred off the asking price.
Taliesin: Seems fair.
Sam: That seems fair.
Will: Completely fair.
Matt: "Five thousand gold, knickknacks and ah, we're all good? Yes?"
Laura: Yes. Five thousand gold.
Matt: "All right, here you are. Please now, it would be wondrous after we complete this transaction that we never meet again."
Laura: Oh dear. I'm afraid I've already Hunter's Marked you.
Matt: "I don't even know what that means." (laughter)
Matt: There's a person waiting behind you. "Um, excuse me--" "We're closed!" (laughter)
Laura: Oh, right, of course, let me count up this little amount right here.
Sam: Kash, Zahra, you should probably contribute.
Laura: No, that's all right, dear. Five thousand gold.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: Oh, and here, these very valuable--
Matt: "Good day! Good day."
Will: It's been a pleasure.
Marisha: I Druidcraft a little tulip and give it to her.
Matt: To him?
Marisha: Him.
Will: Her now.
Mary: Her now. Kash does have an effect, doesn't he?
Marisha: Debateable.
Matt: He takes it, confused, and goes--
Laura: Wait, what potions did we just take?
Matt: You grab the potions that are on the table that he pushed towards you. There is one superior healing--
Laura: You said there was two superior.
Travis: One superior, two greater, and ten--
Matt: Yes. One superior, two greater, ten regular.
Laura: That's a good amount.
Marisha: That's pretty good. I didn't realize there was ten in there.
Laura: Yeah, it's a lot. Okay, cool.
Taliesin: And we only had to threaten a shopkeeper with bodily harm to get it.
Will: I was gonna say, it was the first time I've ever intimidated anybody in my life. It was fun. (laughter)
Will: That was fun, I have to admit.
Laura: You guys-- I'm sorry, but we make a pretty good team.
Will: That wasn't bad. I could get used to that.
Travis: Not that it's like, not for nothing, will you take this fucking dagger out of my arm?
Marisha: Does this mean we're a terrible influence?
Laura: I cast Cure Wounds on Grog.
Taliesin: It means you're a good influence or we're a terrible influence on you.
Matt: It would only have been like two points of damage to you, so that would have healed up fine.
Sam: Vex.
Laura: Yeah?
Sam: He said two superior.
Laura: He did say two superior. I knew he said two superior! Matt!
Marisha: Oh, look at that, look at that, look at that!
Laura: I chase after him.
Sam: I'm coming too. (laughter)
Taliesin: No! No! No?
Matt: So you come into the tent after him?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: No, no, it's brilliant. Let it play. Let it play.
Laura: Actually, dear. Dear? I believe you left one of your potions off the table.
Matt: He turns around. "The superior potions are five thousand gold apiece, baseline."
Laura: But you said you had two superior and you said all the potions for the amount we said.
Matt: "I said all the ones I placed on the table before you."
Liam: Ah, there's so much blood on this fucking dagger. Ugh.
Laura: Are you going back on your word?
Matt: "You've made a grand deal with what we said. If you continue to push this, I'm afraid I'm going to have to get the guards."
Laura: Eh. Superior's a superior.
Will: My guess is he couldn't get to the front of the tent by the time we got to him. But that's up to you. We're just guests here.
Laura: No, it's all right. I know they're expensive. And we've already taken enough advantage.
Travis: Yeah, if they're what they say they are.
Laura: No!
Travis: That's what I'd do.
Liam: Cross your fingers.
Laura: Can I sniff and make sure it's actually a real potion that he gave us? Did he give us fucking fake potions?
Matt: You can go back and take a moment and sniff, yeah. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Laura: Is it like watered-down gasoline?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 23.
Matt: You take it and uncork and sniff. Yeah, it's a very familiar pungent herbal smell of--
Will: Watered-down gasoline.
Matt: Yeah. (laughter)
Laura: Fine. Okay.
Taliesin: You did very well and there are other things that we should think about purchasing.
Laura: You're right, you're right, you're right.
Sam: That lady was the worst. (laughter)
Travis: That lady's the worst.
Mary: Do you need to get gunpowder?
Taliesin: I could use a bit of a top-up just because who knows when the next time we're going to be in this direction.
Sam: To a pub?
Mary: No, let's go to the gunpowder. Let's get you some.
Taliesin: And perhaps, considering that we're going to be very mobile, a map would not be the worst purchase.
Laura: I thought we have a good map of the world.
Matt: You have a fair map of Tal'Dorei and you have what is a basic layout of the continents.
Taliesin: Don't we have a mapmaker?
Marisha: We do have a mapmaker. Wasn't he here? Or was he in Emon?
Matt: You met Tyriok here.
Marisha: Tyriok, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matt: Though you haven't seen him. He mentioned to you previously he's currently traveling to finish his--
Marisha: Yeah, that's right. We caught him in the tavern, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Mary: Don't you think the Slayer's Take-- should I run back and talk to Vanessa?
Will: Vanessa has to have maps somewhere.
Mary: She's got to have one somewhere. You need a basic map of Vasselheim, is that what you're speaking of?
Taliesin: It would not be a terrible thing to have, considering we're going to be traveling.
Marisha: Of Vasselheim? Or of--?
Sam: The world.
Matt: Othanzia is the larger country set around. The continent is Issylra. Issylra is a very large continent. It's almost the equivalent of Asia and Russia, like that whole-- it's very wide and a lot of it is wild and untamed land and wilderness.
Taliesin: Let me top up a bit on what I need.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I'll need you as well because you hold the purse strings.
Liam: Who's got the potions?
Matt: Hmm?
Liam: Who's got the potions?
Laura: I have the potions.
Sam: Can I divvy those out, please?
Liam: Ah, I'm so fast, but I'm really weak. Can I have another one?
Laura: I already gave you a greater.
Liam: I know you did. But I get fucked up really easily. Could I have another one?
Laura: I give-- wait, how many people are there? Eight of us.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: So there was a few regulars, yeah?
Liam: Just another, one more.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll give you two normies.
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: And everybody else gets a normie as well.
Taliesin: I'll take a normie.
Will: Thank you.
Sam: Who gets the supe? And the great?
Laura: Who's our weakest?
Sam: (clears throat)
Laura: Yeah, you're pretty weak. Take a greater, Scanlan.
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: The two poor decision makers, I imagine.
Liam: What's that, Smoke Man?
Laura: Grog, do you want the other greater? Yeah, take the other greater. And then I have one superior. How many hit points does a superior heal?
Matt: A superior heals 8d4 plus eight.
Liam: That's low.
Laura: That's not that many. It's 5,000 gold?
Marisha: Yeah, no. No, healing potions are generally a rip off.
Laura: What a waste.
Marisha: I know.
Matt: Oh my god! I just buy healing to save my life! Such a waste! (laughter)
Matt: Oh my god, there's like a whole trade of really talented magical practitioners that spend their time crafting and brewing up these potions in the hopes they can save your life in the future.
Liam: What's this character called? What's this character called?
Marisha: It's true, I did buy a book to learn alchemy, and I just haven't had time to do it.
Mary: It's a great read, trust me.
Marisha: The alchemy book? Yes?
Travis: Are we fucking buying anything else or what are we doing now?
Laura: Black powder.
Liam: He needs the Bang Bang Man.
Taliesin: Let's go get some powder. Let's get some black powder and whatever else we might--
Mary: Boomstick needs the bang.
Sam: While they're buying powder, I'm going to go get a fucking drink somewhere.
Travis: Ooh! Yeah!
Taliesin: We'll meet you at the pub.
Marisha: I'll go with Scanlan and Grog.
Will: I'm going to go to the pub as well.
Laura: I'm going with Percy. Go get a drink.
Will: Okay, I'm going to go to the pub.
Travis: Yeah, you are, you bad, intimidating motherfucker!
Sam: The Abundant Terrace area.
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: Okay. Are you coming to the pub?
Liam: No, I'm going to help-- no, I'll see you in a bit.
Will: I'll take care of her. We'll be fine. Don't worry about it.
Sam: Dagon is the owner.
Matt: Correct, yes. The two taverns you've been to is that of the Bellows' Respite Inn, which is in the Braving Grounds. So yeah, you can go to either one of those.
Sam: Oh. Grog, would you rather go to the one near the Braving Grounds?
Travis: Yeah, sure.
Sam: Or this one?
Matt: Up to you.
Laura: Don't start any fights, we have a dragon to kill.
Travis: Come on, shot-caller, pick one.
Sam: Yeah, whatever's closer.
Matt: Closer would be the Bellows' Respite, that's also where the Crucible was, the one that was on the outside of it.
Sam: Let's go.
Will: Better ale.
Marisha: Old stomping grounds, Grog.
Matt: So you guys go get drinks. Who's going--?
Taliesin: Vex and I are going and-- are you coming as well?
Mary: How far are we from the Slayer's Take, and is there any other place in town that I personally would know of from being here about three months, to find a map?
Matt: You can go back and ask the Slayer's Take. They have basic maps of the nearby countryside. A lot of the contracts require you to travel across this side of Othanzia. You go back and you talk to Vanessa and you procure one of the maps there that are usually supplied for one of your missions.
Mary: All right, and then I'm going to the bar to get a fucking drink.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: All right, so most of them are drinking. Vex and Percival head-- you guys are all heading actually in the same area, to the Braving Grounds outside the Trial Forge, since that's where the bar is and that's also where Victor's little powder-covered hovel is.
Liam: Bring him out. Bring him out!
Matt: So (laughs) as you approach the same area, you can see that the building is the same as it was before, other than it's missing half a roof.
Taliesin: He might be a bit low on powder.
Matt: It appears to be haphazardly covered with a series of boards that were nailed to keep things closed, but there is definitely, with the snow and the rain, it's probably not the best place to be staying or living.
Taliesin: I'm going to remove my coat. As I've learned.
Laura: Yes?
Taliesin: Do we have Trinket with us?
Laura: Yes, of course.
Taliesin: I'm going to put my coat on Trinket for a moment, just to keep it clean.
Laura: A walking coat rack, that's what Trinket is.
Liam: Percy, that's not a good idea.
Matt: Trinket's trying to get the coat off.
Taliesin: Thank you, Trinket (knocking). Hello?
Matt: Some movement, and you hear the shattering of glass and you hear a (frustrated noise).
Taliesin: Victor, are you in there?
Matt: "Just a moment!" Suddenly the door, whoosh!, slams open and before you, you see Victor, half covered in soot, has a big old thick pair of glasses on his face, one of which is cracked. You can see his chin now has this puffed out, partially burnt and curled bit of a goatee at the very tip of his chin. He looks up at you with these giant eyes that are projected and magnified by his eyewear. "Can I help you?!" (laughter)
Taliesin: Yes, it's Percival. Do you remember me?
Matt: "No!" (laughter)
Taliesin: Excellent.
Matt: "Is that all?!"
Taliesin: I was hoping to procure some black powder again. We had a-- we made a deal last time--
Matt: "Yes, yes, come in, please come in!"
Taliesin: Do I have to? Okay.
Matt: He turns around and heads back inside.
Laura: I'm going to stand out here.
Taliesin: That's quite wise. Please keep my jacket clean.
Matt: As you enter, indeed, a good half of the roof is missing and you see now a lot of things have been moved away because currently there is a pile of burnt and destroyed wood splinters that are also soaked through, and there's a little bit of mold and rotten mildew that has gathered in that far corner as well, from the weather.
Liam: I'm going to stand over here and fail to stay in character, okay? (laughter)
Taliesin: You should roll for that. You're looking well.
Matt: "Heh, heh! Mostly." He turns around and you can see now, what you failed to notice when you first started this is where once there was five, there is now three fingers.
Marisha: Yes, he has character progression! (laughter)
Taliesin: That's impressive.
Matt: "Learn from my mistakes!" (laughter)
Taliesin: You can learn three more times, easily.
Matt: "I can. Three, four-- yes!" He runs off and starts rummaging through a bunch of stuff.
Taliesin: Victor, I was hoping you would have some black powder for sale.
Matt: "I'm on it, I'm on it! Hold on!" He whips around with this metallic cylinder that is very well sealed. "See, I learn from my mistakes!"
Taliesin: That's very impressive. Oh--
Matt: He walks very carefully, very gingerly placing it on the table. "Okay. Carefully." He pulls out (fwoosh) a small torch. "I have to unseal the metal."
Taliesin: Let's not do that! And I make a quick... I'm going to try and bap the thing down as quickly as I can.
Matt: Okay. You smack it out of his hand.
Taliesin: Let's... I trust you implicitly.
Matt: "Heh heh heh heh. It's coffee." (laughter)
Matt: "Black powder." (cackles) (laughter)
Taliesin: I think you've had enough. I'm going to smell the coffee. It's really coffee?
Matt: Yeah. "Sorry, trying to host. It's been a while since I've had a guest. Would you like some?"
Taliesin: Just one spoonful would be quite--
Matt: He goes over to a small kettle and begins straining it through. He's got this little coffee brew on the side. "So, real black powder. Wait! I do know you."
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: "You've purchased before."
Taliesin: I have.
Matt: "Return customer. Not many of those."
Taliesin: Not many? Have there been others?
Matt: He pours a couple of cups for you, pulls it over to you. "Oh, one. Months ago."
Taliesin: Really? Who would--?
Matt: "Nice woman. Young, good outfit, well dressed, heh."
Taliesin: Excellent. She didn't happen to say where she was going, did she? By any chance?
Matt: "No, no. Weeks, not months. Time-- strange."
Taliesin: Weeks? Very good to know. Thank you, that's so helpful. Did you talk about anything else with this nice young woman, at all?
Matt: "No! She paid well!"
Taliesin: I'm sure she did.
Matt: "Kept her distance."
Taliesin: I'm sure she did as well. (laughter)
Taliesin: That's-- I'm curious, how have your own experiments been going? Going well? (laughter)
Taliesin: You should get that looked at some point. Three more, three more.
Matt: "Three."
Laura: Percival?
Taliesin: Yes! So any black powder that you have, I would be happy to--
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Help you pay for a new roof, maybe.
Matt: "Oh, I have to fix that."
Taliesin: You do. Money can help.
Matt: "Explains the cold." He smears black right across the front of his face.
Taliesin: Doesn't it, though?
Matt: It's like gelled in with whatever mucus had been captured in there as well, streaked across.
Taliesin: Oh, that's not a mustache. That's so-- ugh.
Matt: He comes back and he's now keeping, previously it was out in the open, he's learned his lesson. He has these glass vials, similar to what they put potions in, but now he's filling them with powder. And he brings out about four of them. "This is as much as I will spare. I already sold a lot recently to the lady. I have my own tinkering to do, but if you wish to buy these?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "I would be happy to sell."
Taliesin: That would be lovely.
Matt: "Okay. Process of distilling, drying, preparing, 250 gold!"
Taliesin: I think that's very fair.
Matt: "Wondrous! Deal, deal."
Taliesin: Vex?
Laura: Yes?
Taliesin: 250 gold, if you'd be so kind.
Laura: That much?
Taliesin: I'm going to make you something lovely.
Laura: (singsong) I love you!
Taliesin: You're welcome.
Matt: "Hiiii!"
Laura: H-hi. I give the money to Percy to give to him.
Taliesin: And I hand it out. (laughter)
Matt: "Would you like some coffee?"
Taliesin: Victor! Thank you, you're so kind. And if you would be so lovely as to not mention us to my friend if she should happen back.
Matt: "50 gold."
Sam: Oh, shit!
Laura: Tell you what, Victor. I don't think you want to tell her anything.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Liam: All you need is a five.
Laura: Wait, wait, wait. 12.
Matt: (laughs) Given the circumstance, he has a really low DC on this, so I'm glad this is the one you rolled a 12 on. He goes, "For you? I saw nothing!" (laughter)
Taliesin: I love you, darling.
Matt: He catches it and he grabs a glass vial and puts it in and caps it up.
Laura: Okay. Keep it safe, dear.
Taliesin: Until we meet again. All of us. Until we all meet again. Always a pleasure. Ah, keep safe, and--
Matt: "Yes?"
Taliesin: Keep safe.
Matt: "Will do."
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "Bye!" He waves with his three fingers. "Close the door when you're done!"
Liam: If I may-- (cheering)
Taliesin: You're welcome, Internet. You're welcome.
Laura: That was amazing.
Liam: Oh, man. Hire that fucking fool! (laughter)
Matt: The rest of you find your way back at the Bellows' Respite Inn where the rest of the party has been drinking. (cheering)
Marisha: How'd it go?
Mary: (drunkenly) Wait, wait, wait, wait-- okay-- okay.
Matt: Wow, you've been drinking.
Mary: Grog, Grog.
Travis: Yeah?
Mary: The first time I ever saw you, you were fighting... the Hammer? Who were you fighting?
Travis: Yep, yep, Hammer, Hammer.
Mary: You were fighting the Hammer. So I went away and I made you... a hammer. And I'm gonna give you the hammer.
Travis: You made me a hammer?!
Mary: I did! That's what I do. I like to forge things.
Travis: Really?
Mary: I do. So I made you a hammer.
Laura: Does she not drink very much?
Will: Not very much at all.
Travis: That is amazing! I love hammers!
Mary: And I put my crest on it. It's a moon. It's a full moon.
Liam: You said she was lush, you didn't say she was a lush.
Travis: Is it like a moon hammer?
Mary: A lovely moon hammer. I want you to have it. I want you to have it.
Will: Z, you gotta slow down.
Marisha: No, never!
Travis: You don't-- you don't have it now?
Mary: I'll give it to you before we go.
Travis: Oh, okay.
Laura: I go and I sit next to Kashaw.
Liam: Keek.
Marisha: What? Hi.
Liam: How many of those have you had?
Marisha: What?
Liam: Less than five?
Will: Two or three.
Marisha: Three? Two, three?
Will: Enough to where it's fun.
Marisha: It's blurry. You should join us! You all have to catch up. Come on! Life has been hard! Come on.
Mary: Come on, Burt!
Matt: A barkeep comes by, a human gentleman you recognize from before as Once-Lucky Ned, who had originally given you some information. Comes by, puts the drinks down. "I thought it was you!"
Travis: Yep.
Matt: "Heh, heh. Phillip! Phillip! It's good to see you."
Travis: No, no, it was-- it was Philip before, and now it's Grog.
Matt: "Oh, he beat the name out of you. That's harsh."
Travis: No, no, no. That was the first time, and then I came back and won my vengeance. Right?
Matt: "Right, right."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "You want to be known as... I see (clicks tongue). I got you."
Travis: Grog, Grog.
Matt: "Grog the Phillip is in town! Should anyone wish to take the title of the Crucible, this would be the one to talk to. Heh-heh."
Mary: Woo!
Matt: Faces turn, then go back to business.
Marisha: Is Zahra the only one that claps?
Mary: Woo! Ooh! (laughter)
Will: Oh, Z. Oh, Z.
Mary: Shut up, Kash.
Marisha: I have missed you guys. I've never met you! But I missed you guys.
Mary: I've missed... you.
Taliesin: I think we need to catch up a bit. Vax, Vex, let's all have a toast to the inevitability of the universe, please. A cheers.
Liam: Which one of us? What was that?
Taliesin: Vex and Vax. We're having a toast to the inevitability of the cosmos.
Laura: A toast? We're toasting? At a time like this?
Taliesin: We are.
Marisha: Look, there's never not a good time to toast.
Will: Is there a better time to toast than when the world is gonna end?
Marisha: Exactly.
Mary: We're about to lose everything, we might as well celebrate what we've got.
Marisha: I toast to celebrating the end of the world with the best friends we could possibly have.
Taliesin: I'm, I'm, I have something to say to this.
Sam: Oh, Percy, well.
Taliesin: I have something to say.
Marisha: All right, Percy, come on.
Taliesin: When one is born into gentry, one is born with an innate sense of destiny. (groaning)
Taliesin: An innate sense that the world is moving in a direction--
Sam: Fuck the dragons! (laughter)
Taliesin: We have been given a direction to move to actually defeat our foes. We have been given a sign, we have been given something to move for. There is an inevitability to the goodness of the universe--
Travis: (slurred) Inevitability.
Marisha: There is something to fight for, damn it!
Sam: Fuck the dragons!
Taliesin: Fuck the dragons!
Marisha: Fuck the dragons!
Mary: Here's to fighting for something more than just money.
Travis: (slurred) Inevitability.
Liam: I would rather be with you all than the finest people in the world.
Marisha: Cheers to that, because God knows we're not the finest.
Mary: When you find them, let us know.
Will: I agree with you about the inevitability of the universe. The inevitability is that it's always shit.
Taliesin: There's stones that are thrown into the river. There are stones that are thrown upon the river, but the river always moves.
Will: It's true, but you're not talking about the fish that's killed by the stones that's thrown into the river.
Travis: Can I go and find the barkeep?
Matt: Yeah, Once-Lucky Ned is there.
Travis: Remember, right? It's just Grog. It's not like "Grog the Phillip." It's just Grog.
Matt: "Oh, I apologize."
Travis: No, it's all right, it's okay. So, does Earthbreaker Groon, does he ever come in here? Big guy, muscley, long, like, stringy--
Matt: "I know of him. He doesn't come in and drink, no. He spends most of his days over there in that big Trial Forge Temple of Kord."
Travis: He never comes out?
Matt: "He'll go into the city on occasion. But he's one of them, how do I put it? 'Medititive' types."
Travis: "Medititive"?
Matt: "Yes. Spends a lot of time thinking. Sleeping while standing up. It's weird."
Travis: What? I don't understand. How do you do that?
Matt: "You'll have to ask him."
Travis: "Medititive."
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: Meeting of the minds.
Travis: All right. Is he like--? All right. Thank you.
Matt: "No worries. I mean, if I recall, he actually came and saw your last bout."
Travis: Yeah, he did! And I want to like go see him, but I don't know anything about "medititiveness," like sleeping standing up.
Matt: "Go over there to the Trial Forge! He's seen you once, maybe he'll say hello again."
Travis: What should I, like, bring him a gift?
Matt: "I don't know. I don't ever talk to him."
Travis: Is anybody here, like, in the room right now behind me? Are they present at the Trial Forge very often? Hey, don't be so obvious. (laughter)
Matt: "No clue."
Travis: All right. And I flip him a silver. Bing.
Liam: That's like half a penny. (laughter)
Travis: We're just talking (laughs). All right.
Sam: (sighs) What is it, like, noon right now? (laughter)
Taliesin: (singing) Day-drinking!
Matt: Well, no, it's probably about 1 30, 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
Mary: (slurring) Kash and I just got back from frikkin' and it's time to drinkin'!
Will: We haven't even eaten yet.
Marisha: Well, (laughs) I lost a fourth of my civilization!
Will: That is funny.
Travis: Wow. That went dark.
Liam: I raise the bottom of Keyleth's glass and keep it going. (laughter)
Sam: Should we find Kima next, or should we spend the day here?
Marisha: Oh, that's right, we still have work to do.
Laura: Well, we do have some very inebriated--
Liam: Yeah, I think we've accidentally gotten shit-faced.
Mary: I can just walk and not do anything.
Travis: Yeah, no, she can manage.
Marisha: Maybe if we hang here long enough Kima will show up.
Liam: No. We're drunk. Here's what we should do.
Laura: I'm not drunk.
Liam: You ready?
Sam: I'm not drunk.
Taliesin: I'm not either.
Liam: We should go watch Grog fight.
Laura: What? There are dragons in the world, right now! And we're fighting? We're going to watch a fight?
Liam: We need-- listen to me. We need Kima with us, but Kima doesn't have time for fucking drunkards. You might not be, but some of us are a little drunk. So, while that's going on, we wait a day, right? And while that day is going on, we watch Grog pummel some person's face in.
Marisha: Plus, when I was a little girl, we used to be taught that if you were ever lost in the forest, to stay and hug a tree.
Laura: Don't hug him, Keyleth.
Marisha: And someone will come and find you.
Will: I like this plan.
Marisha: So if we stay in one place and this ale is like our tree, okay? We hug the ale and Kima will show up. That's my theory.
Matt: While this is happening, Vex, you glance over her shoulder to the entryway to this bar, and you see stepping in, a familiar, burly looking half-orc gentleman.
Marisha: Damn it, I was hoping it was Kima!
Taliesin: That would have been hilarious.
Matt: He walks in, wiping his hands from dirt in the mines, stops, looks over at your table. Slowly backs out of the tavern and steps back out into the thoroughfare.
Liam: Hey, look at that guy who went out the door! He looked like that guy you fought in that ring.
Travis: Really?
Liam: That guy, yeah. Go get (stammering) do it again.
Travis: Hold on a second. And I run out the door. I run after him, out the door.
Matt: Yeah. Make a perception check.
Liam: Oh, come on, Grog.
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18. You step out in the front of the tavern, and immediately to the left, you see him ducking into the alleyway.
Travis: Wait! Kern! Kern! And I take off running after him.
Matt: Okay. You turn around the corner and you see his back is against the wall and he has sweat dripping down his brow. "Hi."
Travis: Hey. Funny seeing you here.
Laura: I run up behind Grog.
Marisha: Why are they acting like they fucked?
Travis: Things been good?
Matt: At this point--
Will: Did you guys date?
Marisha: They're ex-lovers!
Matt: He looks down. "Still a little sore."
Travis: Right. Yeah.
Matt: "How about you?"
Travis: When I chew, my jaw goes to one side. It's fucking weird.
Matt: "Yeah."
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Are you guys all right, then? Everything's fine?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: All right, I'm going to go, grab a drink.
Travis: So, I meant to ask you, that big, muscly, like long stringy white-haired guy that was watching our last fight.
Matt: "Yeah, yeah. The Earthbreaker."
Travis: Yeah. Who is he to you?
Matt: "I've seen him around. Haven't really... I talked to him once. I'll level with you. Went to him for a little training after our first fight."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "Um. Says I'm a little too angry to pursue his path."
Travis: Angry?
Matt: "I got a lot of pent-up rage the way I was raised." (laughter)
Travis: Family issues? Tell me about it.
Matt: "Tell me about it. (chuckles) Well, half my folks are bloodthirsty, wandering barbarians in the Northern Wastes."
Travis: No way! (laughter)
Matt: "Yeah. What, you think being a half-orc's great? No! It's bullshit!"
Travis: I know! You think goliath is any better? It's the same fucking thing!
Matt: "At least you're made for this weather! It's cold out here!"
Travis: That's true, it is fucking cold out here.
Matt: "Yeah, it is."
Travis: I can only imagine. I'm really sorry I took your lip off, by the way.
Matt: "Sorry I took yours off, too."
Travis: That's true. Mine healed better.
Matt: "Yeah."
Travis: Hey, so. When you trained with him, because you were doing all that yoga pilates stuff. Did it help you out?
Matt: "Well, obviously not, really."
Travis: Right. What did he ask in exchange for the tutorial?
Matt: "He didn't ask for any pay. He--"
Will: Oh god, what did he ask for?
Matt: "He told me I had--"
Sam: (mutters) Pretty eyes.
Matt: "--to help someone." (laughter)
Travis: Help someone.
Matt: "He still hasn't given me the proper details yet and he hasn't called in the debt, but he told me one day, I was to help him test someone, and he'd train me."
Travis: In that Trial Forge, are there like, more of him, like a bunch of big, jacked-out guys in there?
Matt: "Not as big as him, no. But there's plenty of others that train under him. All sorts of warriors. Weapons of all kinds. It's Kord!" He looks over, and you see in the distance, the giant statue of Kord that sits atop the Trial Forge. He looks over and with a look of reverence, gives a nod, and you can see that this man, a glimmer of faith in his eyes. He himself probably a follower of Kord as well. "He's a great man. I'm not the right temperament, it seems. But that's fine. He's getting along okay."
Travis: Right. I won't take up too much more of your time, but if I could ask you one last thing. Aside from the Slayer's Take and the Trial Forge, if you had to find men at arms, men to attack a very large foe, possibly quite dangerous, where would you go?
Matt: "Probably the Platinum Sanctuary. Between them and the Trial Forge, that's most of the actual army. Most of it's Trial Forge. It's part of what the Braving Grounds are about. They train the armies here, it's where they breed warriors."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "Most of the Bastions that look over the city are trained here, so it's-- those are my best bets, at least. Not much of a political man."
Travis: Well, it's been good seeing you. No one hit quite as hard as you did.
Matt: "You too. Um. The medal was a joke. I was in a sore place. Literally, a very, very sore place."
Travis: Uh-huh.
Matt: "I wanted to apologize for that."
Travis: Uh-huh.
Matt: "I should go." He starts walking past you, out into the main street.
Travis: Kern. Kord's strength to you, my friend.
Matt: He doesn't even look back to you. "Uh, you too!" and keeps walking. (laughter)
Taliesin: Wow. Wow.
Travis: I go back into the tavern.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Did you kill him, Grog?
Travis: Yep, yep, there's a lot of pieces of him all over the alley!
Sam: That's my boy.
Travis: Yeah, I like, left nothing to find. It's great.
Sam: All right.
Laura: I walked out and they were making out.
Travis: Shut the-- that is not what we were doing.
Laura: Mugging down in the alleyway.
Marisha: Ooh, Grog! I didn't know you swung that way.
Travis: Swung what way?
Marisha: Toward-- never mind.
Sam: Swung your axe.
Mary: Could I have another cup of coffee here?
Matt: "Of course, coming your way."
Liam: No man's-- you know-- goes straight on. Goes a little bit to the left, a bit of--
Will: Some men go straight on.
Liam: I go sit down next to Kash.
Laura: I sit down next to the other side of Kash, in between him and Keyleth.
Taliesin: I'm going to sit and watch right next to you.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: (yelling) Another drink!
Laura: How about, Keyleth, not another drink.
Marisha: What?
Laura: How about you have some water, dear.
Marisha: Mm, it's been a long few weeks.
Mary: Come here, Keyleth darling, we'll get some coffee.
Taliesin: No coffee for me, thank you.
Liam: Excuse me, if I may. All I want to say is that you are a very impressive man in many ways. You are handsome and capable.
Laura: Your eyes are two different colors, which is very interesting.
Liam: That's a little creepy, but other than that, you are very, very capable-- Percival, I'm having trouble focusing, so if you could sort of go behind Kash.
Will: I don't know what's happening. I don't know what's happening. Is he hitting on me? What's happening?
Liam: No, no. No, no, no, no. There's only one man for me.
Will: What?
Liam: All I'm saying is--
Mary: What man is that?
Liam: (slurring) We could use your help, all right? I know you're a bit of a mercenary, but you are a very capable man and there is a lot at stake. There is a lot at stake. There are dragons, they killed-- I'm not going to get into it. But I implore you to look past yourself and please try to think of the greater world. (stuttering) I'm an admirer--
Will: You've said several times that you're an admirer of mine.
Liam: Yes.
Will: Very sweet.
Liam: Also, one last thing.
Will: Mm-hmm?
Liam: You know what, never mind. I don't want to talk about that. And I wander off into the other side of the room.
Will: I have literally no idea what just happened.
Sam: (laughs) He's a complicated man. He goes to dark places.
Laura: Keyleth. Maybe you should go see what's happening?
Liam: (muffled) It's dark in this closet!
Marisha: What?
Laura: Go, maybe you should go see what is going on with my brother? Maybe you should go find out what's happening with my brother.
Liam: How do you get this closet door open? I can't get back out here.
Laura: He's stuck in a closet.
Mary: It's all right. Girl talk. So, Keyleth.
Marisha: What. What. What?
Mary: I heard a little. I wasn't sure and I then saw you and I thought oh, all right, well, you know, yeah, all right. So, what, you know? With the what? (whispers) What happened? With him?
Marisha: I literally never even had this experience in high school, it's throwing me.
Mary: (whispers) Come on.
Marisha: I don't know how to react to any of this.
Liam: What is high school?
Laura: Keyleth. She's talking about you kissing Kash.
Mary: Yeah.
Marisha: Oh! Right! Oh!
Mary: He told me. He told me a little bit.
Marisha: Funny you mention that, yeah, you know--
Laura: Wasn't he your first kiss?
Mary: Do you like him?
Laura: Isn't that so wonderful?
Mary: I know, it's wonderful. Do you like him?
Marisha: I, um, you know, okay, I'm kind of new to all of this. I don't really know what's going on?
Mary: What, to talking? You're doing very well.
Marisha: Thank you. I'm new to that as well.
Mary: No!
Marisha: Um--
Laura: I'll give you a helpful hint.
Marisha: Okay. Yes.
Laura: If you're interested in someone, make sure they know.
Marisha: (breathless) Oh.
Laura: And if you're not, then stop fucking dragging them along, because it's not fair.
Mary: What if she doesn't know? What if she can't decide?
Marisha: Oh, you think I'm dragging Kash along? Oh no no no no no.
Laura: Sure. You're dragging Kash along.
Marisha: I mean, he was just, I only spent a day with him.
Laura: Mmm.
Marisha: It was just a day.
Liam: Vex! I can't get out of this closet.
Will: Jesus.
Laura: Is he really, truly stuck in a closet? Right now?
Marisha: I thought he was a lockpick.
Laura: (laughing) I go, I walk away.
Liam: (mournfully) I rolled a one.
Marisha: This is literally the only thing Vax is good at. He really can't get out of the closet?
Taliesin: I just want to say, I don't think the dragons stand a chance. (laughter)
Will: We've got them now!
Liam: I can't get out of this closet as hard as I try.
Laura: What are you doing? Stop it.
Marisha: Seriously though (quietly) I'm really confused.
Mary: I know, don't hurt him. He's wonderful.
Marisha: Kash?
Marisha: Okay.
Mary: He's wonderful.
Marisha: Okay.
Mary: If you do-- he's wonderful.
Taliesin: My god, I love other people's problems.
Sam: This is amazing. Sorry about this, Kash.
Will: No, this has been wonderful.
Sam: When our party gets--
Will: I have men and women telling me I'm incredible.
Taliesin: You are very attractive.
Will: That's, wow, that's two.
Sam: I just met you, and I don't know much about you, but are you more of a Vax man or a Vex man? Like, how do you roll? How do you--?
Will: I don't, again, I don't know what that means. (laughter)
Sam: Would you be interested in the rogue or the ranger?
Liam: We're identical.
Will: Oh. Oh! I see what you're saying. All right, I get it. I go taco, not hot dog.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Yes! I love taco!
Sam: High five it.
Travis: Respect. Respect.
Laura: Are we sober yet? Can we go find Kima?
Mary: Yes, we're sober!
Liam: I think we need to go to bed.
Mary: Yes. Let's get a break.
Matt: After a brief time of coffee and a bit of sobering, you find yourselves of sound enough mind.
Liam: 17 hours later?! (laughter)
Taliesin: Coffee, coffee.
Mary: I metabolize things very quickly, you'd be surprised.
Matt: A few hours, two hours, let's say. It's four, five o'clock in the afternoon.
Marisha: Five o'clock?
Taliesin: Or four o'clock. Four o'clock.
Matt: As you, sobering up, the coffee's helped. You find yourself clear of mind to continue onto your intended events for the day. With that, we're going to go ahead and take a break. We'll be back here-- (cheering)
Will: (laughs) Dragons don't stand a chance! (laughter)
Will: (laughs) That was awesome.
Matt: All right, guys, we'll see you here in a few minutes. Thank you. (laughter)
Liam: That was great. Man. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. So, before we get back into this, a couple quick announcements. One, if we get to 15,000 subscribers tonight, tomorrow's crew will be celebrating 15k and a Cosplay Day. All of our crew will be dressing up as their favorite characters all night. So you guys should go ahead and see if we can hit that number, because that would be awesome and hilarious and awesome.
Laura: I might have heard what some people are going to be dressing up as and I'm very excited about it.
Matt: I heard a couple, too. You guys would enjoy it, so make it happen, please. I want to see it. Also, a reminder that if you want to help support the channel, check out the Geek and Sundry Amazon Wish List. You can find the list in chat if you type "!Wishlist" there and that will give you access to it and you can see if there's any way you want to help build the channel and make it more awesome. So there's that. Liam will join us when he can. But we're going to jump in for the time being. So, as you guys exit the tavern, you look out into the Braving Fields.
Taliesin: I suddenly remember to go back and open the closet.
Marisha: Oh shit, we need to get the rogue out of the closet.
Matt: There is that, yeah. So you're in the center of the Braving Grounds-- we traded Liam for Travis.
Laura: Yeah. I don't know.
Matt: Exactly.
Liam: Grog, can you get this door open? (laughter)
Mary: It is open, darling. Come on.
Sam: Are we going to Kima now, or are we going to go see Grog fight?
Liam: Is Grog fighting?
Matt: To your left, around the Heaven's Stair, the giant mountain that bisects the northern portion of Vasselheim, around that way, a little bit of travel, but that heads towards the Bahamut section of the city, where the Platinum Sanctuary is. To your vision, immediately outside the tavern, you can see the giant statue of Kord, where the Trial Forge is. And to the south of you is where the Quadroads are, in the southern regions. What do you guys want to do?
Travis: I don't really feel like fighting. I just want to go talk to Master Splinter at the Trial Forge.
Sam: Sure, sure. All right, we can do that another day, maybe? Or do you want to--?
Travis: I'm not in a rush.
Laura: Should we go to the Platinum Sanctuary? Where Kima is, right?
Taliesin: Let's go talk to Kima.
Liam: Yeah, right now.
Laura: Oh, should we wait until some people are more sober?
Mary: No, I'm all right, coffee helps. Coffee helps.
Laura: Walking will help.
Mary: Walking and coffee.
Sam: Maybe we should-- they can wait outside or something.
Marisha: But I miss Kima.
Travis: Oh Jesus.
Matt: It's been a few hours, and you guys have had some coffee, so you're still a little tipsy, but you're not useless. (laughter)
Matt: To put it nicely. All right, so where do you guys want to head into--?
Laura: The Platinum Sanctuary.
Matt: All right, you guys make your way south, southwest around the curvature of the base of the Heaven's Stair. You can see up along the mountain itself, large, ominous, this monolith of earth that looks over the entirety of Vasselheim. You can see embedded in the rock itself, there are various homesteads toward the base. As you look up, you can see there's a number of stairways that just spiral around in different directions. You can see small cliffs and precipices that are built on the outside and look to be either various places of individual worship where statues are just barely visible, cresting on the edge. There's a number of constructs, just built into this mountain, that are probably as old as the city itself. You make your way around the south portion of it back into the actual area of Vasselheim, the Silver Talon's Reach, which is where largely Bahamut's worship occurs. You make your way past the scattered temples, all the different huts and hovels that build the central residential real estate to this territory. There are a few homes here that look a little bit like-- this town is built on existing in hardship and difficulty, so a lot of people here are just stern folk that live amongst terrible weather and money and wealth isn't really presented or flaunted in this city. It's considered in very poor taste as everyone here is in some way, shape or form, to some level, is pious to some degree to one of the deities that are worshipped here. You find your way to the base of the stair that you recall, following when you first arrived here in Vasselheim, that leads up to the Platinum Sanctuary where you were delivering the Horn of Orcus originally.
Travis: Oh, that's right.
Matt: You follow it up the side and it is an extended staircase that curves up to these three silver spires that are pushing out from the side of the mountain, quite a ways up. After about almost 20 minutes of stair climbing, your legs start to cramp a bit, but you manage to make your way towards the top, the outside of the large stone doors. There you can see there are two Scalebearers of Vord, in their silver armor, blue cloaks at their back, weapons at the ready, just looking out. And as soon as you guys approach the top of the stairway, they change their stance to be a little more prepared.
Marisha: (panting) Guys, this is hard to do with alcohol in your system.
Will: Hard to do at all.
Liam: A lot of horses and chickens around here, too.
Will: I noticed that as well.
Liam: Everywhere.
Marisha: I didn't know this was a farming industry.
Sam: Hello there. Excuse us. We are of the Slayer's Take-- Is that a good thing?
Laura: Yes.
Sam: We are of the Slayer's Take and we ask for entry into your Platinum Temple.
Matt: "Your business is with whom?"
Laura: Lady Kima.
Matt: Turns, nods to the other guy. They both grab these small handles and give a tug, and the door opens slightly and one of the guys disappears between the two doors. About 30 seconds pass to a minute, before he steps back out. "Your presence has been accepted by the Highbearer Vord, the Silvertouched. He will greet you in the central chamber, please."
Sam: Thank you. How do we address him?
Matt: "Highbearer would suffice."
Sam: All right.
Matt: "Please enter."
Liam: Will Kima be there?
Matt: He doesn't answer. The doors open even wider.
Liam: Hey!
Matt: So as you guys enter the chamber once more, this is close to where you flew in in bird form and almost got arrested by the Highbearers.
Marisha: Uh-huh, right, those guys.
Matt: So, as you enter the chamber, you see a number of the guards have already assembled and they're giving you a walkway path, both as a presentory arrival vigil, but also making sure that you don't wander off the predestined path to the main central meeting chamber.
Will: But it doesn't seem antagonistic in any way.
Matt: No. Just-- they're protecting their temple.
Sam: We'll make it that, though.
Matt: You guys continue inward, towards the central chamber, the high stone ceiling before you. You can see there are holes carved throughout the ceiling and the stonework that cause beams of light to come shooting through from the sky. What catches your interest in here is that the sky is cloudy. There is no specific source of direct sunlight, yet there are beams of light within the temple itself that form a pattern across the stone marble floor of the central chamber.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check?
Matt: Certainly.
Laura: What's the pattern look like?
Matt: The pattern resembles a large shield, when you look at it. It's pointed toward the base of where you guys are walking in and fills most of the chamber in an oval fashion, before coming together in a line towards the back.
Marisha: 17.
Matt: 17? Okay, this definitely isn't a natural occurrence. The sunlight should not be projecting this way, which leads you to believe that there's something about the temple's enchantment or its construction that can either dissipate the veil of clouds to the sunlight or produce their own light to mimic it during all hours.
Marisha: Cool.
Will: Do any of us recognize the symbol on the floor?
Matt: You've seen-- the shield itself is akin to the symbol of Bahamut, which is a shield with a silver dragon head on it. You've seen Kima use it previously when you guys were looking after her in the Underdark.
Laura: We never got that stuff back.
Sam: Her stuff?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: As you guys push to the central chamber, you can see there's a line of three heavily armored Knights of Bahamut that are all there, standing shields at the ready, big tower shields that almost touch the ground. Two of them separate to one side and one separates to the other, and in the center, arriving before you, is Highbearer Vord, the Silvertouched, who some of you are seeing for the first time. Long, light brown hair that crests down past his shoulders, his features are very elven, very soft and ageless, but there is a very faint bluish hue to his skin. His eyes have no irises, no pupils. Steps forward and extends his hands. "It is good to see such friends, so I ask you once again to join me in this chamber. Can I help you?"
Liam: (whispers) Yes.
Laura: You can, actually. Well, we hope that you can, as it concerns dragon matters. We know that you serve Bahamut, the great, the wonderful, the very metallic. These very terrible colored-- chromatic red, green, lots of different dragons, they've attacked--
Sam: How much do you know about the dragon attacks that have been raging across the world?
Matt: He looks about the rest of you, with a discerning glance, just spending a beat on each of you, almost like you're being judged and read in that instant. You feel as if someone is prying into your personality with but a glance, and it's unsettling at first, but nothing too invasive, just enough to catch you off guard. As he finishes the sweep of the party at hand: "I was given a vision in the night of a far city of man, swathed in ice and flame, of colors bonded and unleashed. And I feared it was the work of our lord's nemesis."
Laura: Straight-up nemesis?
Marisha: Yes, can you elaborate?
Matt: He puts his hand up.
Marisha: Sorry.
Matt: "However, with much prayer of mine and my acolytes, we find no tremor of the Dragon Queen, nor the stench of Baator, on this business."
Marisha: Dragon Queen Baator? Is that what he said? Baator?
Matt: Baator. B-a-a-t-o-r.
Mary: Is the Queen-- I'm sorry-- are the Queen and Baator the same?
Matt: Make a religion check.
Laura: All of us or just--?
Matt: All of you, sure. Make a religion check.
Laura: 20!
Marisha: Ten.
Laura: 12.
Mary: 15.
Travis: 18!
Will: 24.
Liam: 13.
Taliesin: 13.
Will: 24.
Matt: Okay. None of these ring a bell, except for you, Kashaw. The Dragon Queen is indeed the nemesis of the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut. It is an entity known as Tiamat and is essentially the patron of most chromatic dragons. She resides in Baator, which is one of the Nine Hells.
Laura: Eugh.
Matt: However, it seems that Vord is speaking in a way that, through much disturbed interest and prayer into this matter, there doesn't seem to be the scent of Tiamat's doing in this matter. And strangely, you see a bit of the tension in his face relax as he tells you this.
Laura: So, if it's not the nemesis, the big nemesis, then you guys could probably take out these dragons, like, no problem, since they're not the Big Bads, they're just really bad.
Matt: "While these entities do concern us, there is the alternate vow that we've spoken, and that is to protect Vasselheim. The city has stood as long as it has because we have not left our post. And the moment that we were to attempt to move even a minority of our people in the city to be of aid to you in this endeavor, this would be the moment that the Dragon Queen will be waiting for to attack our citadel. There are many more forces beyond these dragons that you speak of in this world, bent against the destruction of this city. And we stand because we hold vigil here."
Marisha: But, sir, you should understand how close this destruction came from your doorstep.
Matt: "And yet it avoided our city. Do you know why? Because even such creatures know better than to lend their talons against us."
Marisha: But how do you know that will happen the next time? Is that always where you're going to place your bet?
Matt: "Do you think this will be the first time that ancient dragons have attempted to attack our fair city?"
Marisha: How about four?
Matt: "I can guarantee you, should they mount an attack on us, four or not, they will fall."
Laura: Wow, then I guess everybody in the world can just move here.
Will: Wait a second, you said dragons have attacked before and they were defeated. How?
Matt: "Well, we had the aid of Bahamut with us at that time." And he glances up and you look up and you can see the rays of sun that have come through here, from your current position, you can see actually form a matching symbol. Not of a shield, but of a giant winged dragon outstretched across the curved roof of this temple.
Liam: But let's talk about--
Laura: He's saying something.
Mary: Please continue, I'm so sorry.
Liam: My bad.
Will: We've been drinking.
Matt: "Drinking?"
Will: No. Water. Long walk up.
Matt: "Well, understand. I hear your plight. And I understand that we must aid you in this endeavor, best that we can. But we cannot swear to you our army."
Laura: What sort of aid can you offer, then?
Matt: "Well, now, while you seek out whatever your plot is to tear these creatures from their summit, we will grant to you, from our place in the Dawn City, our finest champion. While I have no resources to offer at this time, this champion shall come to your aid to help in any way that they can. And once they can report their certainty that victory can be had, perhaps we may be able to send a little more of our power your way."
Sam: Will we know the presence of this champion or will it be a silent one?
Matt: "The champion is here." And he steps aside and puts his hand out. And one of the armored knights steps forward, full armor, this tall, wide-chested masculine form. You can't see the face, the helmet protects it, but the shield comes out and slams the ground and goes to kneel on one knee. "Your charge, Platinum Knight Udire, one of our finest warriors, whom has had time and time again--" At which point you hear a loud (clang) sound as all of a sudden, Udire's thrown off of his feet, his shield bent in and skidding across the ground. You see stepping up behind, a female halfling, scar across the face--
Laura: Fuck yeah!
Matt: -- gold-trimmed armor, blue cloak behind her, shouting out, "Oh no, you don't! This is my home turf! I'm going."
Laura: Kima!
Marisha: Yeah, Kima!
Taliesin: We'll take that one.
Marisha: We want that one.
Matt: Highbearer Vord rolls his eyes and sighs loudly. (growls) "Kima, you are in need of discipline and guidance. More than most who walk the Warrior's Path! Your foolish impulses will get you killed!"
Marisha: I think her foolish impulses are exactly what Vox Machina's looking for.
Matt: She grins as she swings her maul, slams it onto the stone ground, a little bit of a rumble as you see a flash of divine energy from that. And a beam from the sky comes down and frames her form as she stands there clutching the top of it. "Better to die a fool for something than live in regret for doing nothing."
Travis: Church! (laughter)
Matt: An awkward pause as Udire gets back up on his feet and pulls up the front of his helmet. You can see there's a very thin pencil 'stache underneath. A chiseled jaw and a man who looks like probably an intense, chivalrous-type knight gentleman, except there's a look of complete disdain and frustration. He gets up and goes, "Really, her?!" Vord raises his hand and grumbles. "Very well. Your new charge is Lady Kima, whom you are already affiliated. Please keep her from doing anything stupid."
Sam: I think we want her to do her stupidest. Udire, it would have been a swell adventure with you, maybe next time. Sir, thank you for granting us this aid that we will definitely need in our journey. We also are new to this dragon-slaying business and would love your advice and any information you might have, especially about some specific items. Something called the Vestiges of Divergence?
Matt: His eyes squint for a moment as he puts his hands in front of his face. "Hmm. To step against such powerful dragons is indeed a death sentence. It's true that you need to prepare, arm yourselves against this doom. While we are meant to stay here in the most holiest of places, these relics you speak of from before the Second Spark still lie forgotten. Hmph, these elements even balked the Primordials of old, blades that slew the Children of the Dark. Where these relics lie, only story and tome can tell, unfortunately. Know that at any given time, you are not the only ones seeking this power. Consider things of such great strength are perpetually in the minds of those who would make their riches off of them or intend to take their own townships and peasantry under their own boot and gauntlet. Well..."
Mary: Do these Vestiges help you control the dragons? Do you become their leader if you find them?
Matt: "I don't believe any of that such capability, but I also am not a scholar of ancient magics and artifacts. I have merely come across their whispers in books and various classes I took as a child."
Laura: What sort of books? Fairy books?
Matt: "There are tomes scattered throughout the city. And there is the Cobalt Reserve."
Laura: Cobalt Reserve is gone. The dragons took it out.
Matt: "That is unfortunate."
Marisha: You said these tomes might still be in Vasselheim?
Matt: "Perhaps."
Marisha: Where?
Matt: "I wish I could tell you. We had one such entrusted to us long ago, but that was destroyed as part of the last assault on Vasselheim that we withstood."
Laura: Do you remember the description of any of the items from your stories?
Sam: Or how many there were?
Matt: "The stories say of at least a dozen. I can't be certain. I wish I could be of more aid in this, but this is not a path that I chose to learn much on."
Marisha: And are all artifacts necessary to defeating these dragons?
Matt: "I have no idea."
Laura: We should probably have asked--
Marisha: Osysa.
Matt: "Though the warriors that once wielded these in the battles of old only seemed to have carried one or two each."
Mary: How did you defeat them? The dragons that came to your doorstep?
Matt: "That was before my time, my dear."
Mary: There are no legends, there are no scrolls that might recount the tale of how that happened, that you might still have somewhere?
Matt: "Depends. The Second Spark. Hmm." He takes a moment to gather his thoughts as I take a moment to gather my notes. (laughter)
Will: While you're doing that, Udire's stuck in his armor over there.
Travis: Dented in.
Will: He's just dented in, he can't get out.
Matt: He's not happy at all about that. Hold on. Got it.
Laura: Sorry. One moment please.
Mary: Right here, hold on.
Liam: I've got all my dragon lore over here. Just give me a second.
Matt: "It's a long tale, and I recommend you research the history yourself, but during the times of creation, when the gods first came upon this world, it was a place of chaotic energies, elements clashing. The very landscape itself was in eternal turmoil, wrestling for no purpose other than the destruction of the others. There were no boundaries. Yet the gods still came, and they created us, the various beings and entities. As they came to understand what their purpose was, as they themselves were still uncertain as to why they came to be, they hoped that through their creations, they could learn more about themselves. They began to watch the first burgeoning elves, dwarves, people. Within a short time, a very short time, the very chaotic nature of this landscape consumed and destroyed most of what remained. The only city that stood, the first city: Vasselheim. The titans that walked across these lands, great, primordial elemental kings, beings of no noble mind, sought to destroy any light or beauty. Thus the first war began. The peoples rose up, the gods' feet touched the ground, and alongside their creations they slew the titans, with the first of these Vestiges. Laying them to rest within the dirt, within the sky, casting the elements away from this plane, and separate to their own, where now they remain, amidst fire, earth, air, water, and their muddy boundaries between. Thus came a time of great privilege and prosperity. And it also came to be discovered that some of the gods, as part of creation during this bout with the titans, began to question the purpose of creation, to embrace the chaos that they fought in this battle, and they distanced themselves from the ones that guide us to this day. They began to take the children of the gods, to corrupt them, teach them the wonders of arcana, magics beyond the divine, the gifts of the gods, and for the first time, the creations began to find power separate from the creators. The arrogance to think that perhaps, now, they were gods themselves. Now, they were the gods' creations and they loved them very much, so they did not see this as a threat. But as the second expansion of civilization spread across the world, we saw rise great, new towns and cities and civilizations and cultures, as well as a new wave of insolence and selfishness. And these new dark gods began to prey upon this, and build a force to take those who still stay true to the first. This terrible war, this is what we knew as the Divergence. This is when the people were split in two. The gods were divided as well. Bloody battles ensued. And it looked as though, while all other cities fell into ruin, even Vasselheim would fall. But in this time, these Vestiges were expanded upon, those first few weapons, many more were created. And the Champions fought alongside the gods once more. And victory was had, the dark gods banished to various planes, far from this plane. But it was then the gods also decided that perhaps their delving had caused this, and they receded, leaving the mortals to find their own way, to rebuild a second time, with the warning of the dangers of arcane, which Vasselheim still to this day holds in its prime oaths. Many of these Vestiges that you seek were destroyed, but some were kept, some were lost, some were entombed, some were re-found and rediscovered and used as symbols of power. But since this Second Spark of civilization, the gods felt that the true penance was the destruction of all their people had built, and the gods leaving us to our own. Thus started the Penance, where to this day, we still make up for the infractions and sins of our arrogant brothers and sisters of that day. So, since then, we've had other new civilizations spring up: Wildemount, Tal'Dorei, Syngorn, Marquet. These are the newer cities of the Third Age."
Liam: May I ask-- Vestiges, the word in these legends, it seems vague. Does no one know anything about what they were? Is that a stand-in for things we don't understand or know about? What are these Vestiges?
Matt: "We know of them. Understand, artifacts and relics of this power are very dangerous. And what better way to hide things of such power than to destroy the knowledge of where they may be or even if they exist?"
Marisha: Sir, I come from the Ashari people.
Matt: "Yes."
Marisha: We are here to protect those boundaries that we set several thousand years ago. Do you think that some of this knowledge might still be within my people?
Matt: "It is possible. I am not a practitioner of the history of the Ashari people."
Will: Objects with that much power have to leave some trace somewhere. Anything you can think of, a place to start.
Matt: "Cobalt Reserve. There the monks keep some of the most ancient of texts. We here at Vasselheim keep a watchful eye on things that relate to the wars of old, the history of our deities, of our temples, to not repeat the mistakes we have. The monks are more eclectic in their collections. Perhaps they can be of more aid."
Laura: Maybe not all of the Reserve was destroyed. Maybe they have secret rooms underground, where they keep the most ancient texts. We should at least check.
Taliesin: It would be worth looking, at the very least.
Laura: Allura was on her way there.
Sam: Highbearer. These dragons who are running rampant across the world, them being chromatic dragons, do you think they have pledged their loyalty to the Queen?
Matt: "If they have, it's a very-- no, they would not be able to shroud the sight of the Platinum Dragon himself."
Laura: Isn't it very strange for dragons to pledge their allegiance to any other dragon?
Matt: "For chromatics, it is."
Laura: Then why are they serving the red one?
Matt: "The red one?"
Travis: The Cinder King.
Laura: Thordak.
Marisha: That's what he calls himself.
Laura: He's ancient. He was in the Fire Realm-- the Fire Plane and broke free. And now he has other dragons serving him.
Matt: "Chromatic dragons respond to a few things gold, dominance, and strength. If this red dragon is as ancient and as powerful as you say, perhaps he, even he, could bully lesser dragons."
Marisha: Or do you think it's possible he is offering any one of those rewards?
Matt: "There are many possibilities. You would have to ask one of them yourself."
Taliesin: I get the distinct feeling we will get that chance.
Marisha: So, if this is the Third Age, does that mean the Fourth is upon us?
Matt: "I hope not."
Marisha: As do I.
Matt: "But if it does, we will do everything we can to see that this city stands. It is the only link we have to the past. Should Vasselheim fall, I dare say all is lost."
Mary: At the cost of everything else, Vasselheim stands? That's my only question.
Matt: "That is your question?"
Mary: Yes.
Matt: "From here, civilization could spring anew. People could defend themselves and thrive thereafter. The rest of the world is scattered. Petty squabbles, selfish personal endeavors that lead to foolishness and treachery. Should this city fall, and one of those remain, that is a breeding ground for the dark powers that lie beyond the Veil. It is only here that those who are the most devout could truly have the hearts and minds to guide us, Bahamut forbid, into a Fourth Age."
Sam: Well, thank you for all your help. One more question before we leave you to your--
Matt: Which you see, Kima slams her hammer on the ground. "Oh my god! Can we just go? I'm sick of hearing him rattle on." Vord puts his hand out. "Kima!"
Sam: On our journey, we may have to travel long distances quite often. Is there any means of quick travel to other parts of the continent from Vasselheim?
Laura: Perhaps any flying carpets that you have lying around?
Sam: Airships, teleportation circles, any means that you know.
Matt: "We do not deal in such teleportation magics beyond the divine-provided ones, and those I assume are beyond most of you. However, there is still the Skyport, which I believe you arrived in when you first came to us? Other than that, if none among you are able to achieve any sort of distance translocation, then I highly doubt you have the ability to stand up against these dragons you seek to destroy."
Marisha: We got it. It's fine. It's handled.
Laura: Thank you for the vote of confidence.
Taliesin: I think we have everything we need here.
Laura: Yes, unless you have any amulets or magical things lying around?
Sam: How's that Horn of Orcus going, by the way?
Marisha: Good question, actually.
Matt: "Shh!"
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Taliesin: Ix-nay on the orn-hay.
Sam: Sorry.
Matt: "And with that--"
Laura: So no on the magic items? Of protection?
Matt: "I have business for the day."
Laura: Cool.
Will: I'm not going to ask him how his family is.
Sam: No, don't do that.
Matt: "Show our guests out, please." "With pleasure." Slings her maul up on her shoulder. "Let's step outside first."
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: And she leads you all outside, the temple doors close. As soon as the doors close, she tells the two guards, "Shove off, please. We have to have a conversation." The guards kind of frustratedly turn around and go back and close the door. As soon as the doors close behind them, she goes, "Oh my god, guys!" (cheering)
Matt: She rushes out, gives hugs to everyone that she knows. She skips you, asks to be introduced to-- "And--"
Laura: Zahra. Kima.
Mary: I'm Zahra.
Matt: "Zahra, nice to meet you."
Mary: Nice to meet you, Kima.
Matt: "Kima. Lady Kima."
Mary: Lady Kima. Lady. All right.
Marisha: And have you met Kash? Kashaw.
Will: Kashaw. Vesh.
Matt: "Hmph."
Will: All right then.
Matt: "You're brooding."
Will: Don't mean to be. It's been a rough-- yes. Thank you. (laughter)
Matt: "All right, so. I caught some of that discussion. Dragons? What are we after here?"
Sam: Big scary dragons.
Matt: "I tend to glaze over when he's talking."
Laura: Emon's gone, Kima.
Travis: Yeah, basically four big fuck-off chromatic dragons destroyed Emon and then Westruun and-- Allura was there, she was very upset.
Matt: "Is she all right? Is Allie all right?"
Taliesin: She's fine.
Travis: Yeah, Allie is fine.
Liam: We just parted ways with her-- (groans) I have such a headache.
Taliesin: Two days ago.
Matt: "My home temple's in Westruun."
Travis: Oh.
Laura: We should definitely go there. We need to look at the Cobalt Reserve as well. We need to meet up with Allura, though. She was-- (sighs).
Matt: "All right, well. I'm with you. Wherever you need me."
Marisha: I just pass Vax my water canteen on the sly.
Liam: And I very obviously chug the entire thing.
Matt: "A few of you started early. I'm jealous."
Marisha: Kima, it's been very hard since we last saw you.
Matt: "I can see it on your faces. You all look a bit harrowed."
Travis: Hairy?
Matt: "You surprise me day after day, Grog."
Travis: Why, thank you. Don't have to hide it around me, it's okay.
Matt: "All right, where are we off to?"
Laura: That's a good question.
Marisha: Where are we going?
Will: Cobalt Reserve, he said twice.
Laura: Yes, but that's in Westruun.
Sam: It's been destroyed.
Laura: Not necessarily, I mean yes, it's fucked up.
Travis: We still need to go talk to Earthbearer Groon and see what kind of lesson was there.
Marisha: I also really need to check out the Fire Ashari.
Taliesin: Fire Ashari are on the way.
Liam: Let's count out the things that we want to do. Not what we're going to choose, just what we have to do, and then we'll choose something. We've got the Cobalt Reserve, which may or may not be totally fucked, right?
Mary: It could give us information about these dragons.
Marisha: We need to go by there regardless. We need to stop by Westruun.
Liam: Okay. So there's Osysa's mate.
Laura: That's down by Westruun.
Liam: Down by Westruun, in the mountains.
Marisha: That's on the way.
Liam: Yeah. We've got your people.
Marisha: Also on the way out the door.
Laura: It is?
Marisha: It's not far from here.
Matt: It's roughly three days' travel, southwest of Vasselheim.
Laura: But there's trees.
Marisha: There are trees. I can also pop through a tree. I can pop through a tree through most places. Pop through a tree and get us to Westruun, as long as we take a nap.
Liam: Three options. Are we forgetting anything?
Laura: And Grog wants to talk to--
Travis: Earthbearer Master Splinter.
Marisha: Earthbreaker.
Taliesin: While we charter a ship.
Marisha: Percy really wants an airship. Dear gods, does he want an airship.
Taliesin: What a perfect way to make our way quickly and efficiently.
Liam: Let's just talk--
Marisha: Quickly? Efficiently?
Will: You can go through trees?
Marisha: I can.
Sam: Only trees she's seen and knows very well.
Travis: But the Earthbreaker is here.
Marisha: Luckily, all places that we are going, we've been to.
Liam: I mean, if we're spiraling out, right? Earthbreaker's here, Ashari are close by, and then we're talking about in and around Westruun.
Laura: Yeah. So let's go to the Earthbreaker.
Travis: Yeah, let's go to the Earthbreaker.
Taliesin: Followed by the Ashari.
Sam: Followed by the airship.
Taliesin: Followed by the airship.
Matt: "Earthbreaker. As in Dawn Marshal? The great Dawn Marshal of--? (chuckles) I've only seen him from a distance. He's a rough-looking fella."
Travis: Yeah, right. He's got a pair of arms on him, doesn't he?
Matt: "I'm excited to see this." Puts it over her shoulder and she's walking down, her little legs (clanging) with her armor down the stairs.
Travis: Hold up, Kima. Hold up. What do you mean? Have you spoken with him before?
Matt: "I've seen him punch someone's head clear off."
Laura: Off of his body?
Sam: That is so cool.
Will: You only turn them into paste.
Liam: Level up.
Travis: I'm excited.
Mary: Oh! Oh dear.
Matt: (laughs) "You're not the only one!" And she continues rushing ahead. You get the feeling that Kima's been locked up and been doing temple stuff for quite some time and is very happy to get out of her general duties.
Liam: Lead the way, shitkicker!
Matt: You guys head back down the outside of the Heaven's Stair, making your way back to the outside of the Trial Forge. You can still see now it's middle of the afternoon, all the forges throughout the town are in full steam. You see big plumes of black smoke pouring out of the various steelworks.
Marisha: On our way there, I pace next to Kash. So, do you-- have you met Kima?
Will: No.
Marisha: I get the feeling that you guys knew each other.
Will: No. Never met Kima in my life. She didn't seem to like me very much, which is odd, because everyone else seems to think I'm an amazing guy. Vax and Vex, everyone telling me they love my eyes, they love this-- I don't know, it's weird. Bunch of your friends are just very weird.
Marisha: You seem really put off by it. I didn't know it was so--
Will: I'm not used to being around people all the time. I have one real friend, and that's Z. I'm only with her because she saved my life. I'd do anything for her. Everybody else is odd for me.
Marisha: Yeah, I feel that.
Will: There is one thing I wanted to say to you, though, about our kiss. I'm very happy that it happened. But I shouldn't have stolen it. And for that, I apologize.
Marisha: You don't need to apologize. I also don't ever want to hurt anyone.
Will: Of course.
Marisha: Physically or emotionally.
Will: Nor me.
Marisha: Okay.
Will: Well, I'm glad we got that cleared up. (laughter)
Matt: So as you guys approach the outside steps leading up to the doors of the Trial Forge, you can see the large rust red-colored monument, Temple to Kord. Very rigid and very much a temple built to withstand. It's a fortress more than a temple. And you see above it still, across the lip at the very top at the front walkway, a little bit of the Kord statue, looking over the entirety of this section of Vasselheim.
Travis: Oh boy.
Matt: The doors are actually ajar, they're open.
Travis: Oh!
Matt: There are two Dawn Marshals there in their armor with the colors of Kord. As you approach, they step out of the way.
Laura: Ooh.
Travis: Yes, clearly my presence is recognized in this great hall. Good day, good day. (laughter)
Travis: Wouldst thou care to follow me inside?
Sam: Let's do this.
Liam: Verily, verily.
Laura: Huzzah, I say, my Lord.
Marisha: My liege.
Matt: As you walk in, the two Dawn Marshals that are out there put their arms together and they lower their head and bow. And as you enter, they close the doors behind you guys. The doors slam behind you and you feel the stone shift from the impact of the thud. 25-, 30-foot-tall doors that mark the front of this.
Travis: It's all right. Pucker up, we're okay.
Matt: The echo of the stone slam down the long hall. You can see there are large pillars that mark the run to the central chamber. You've been here before, and as you walk across the smooth, very, very simple stonework ahead, you can see there is the central portion. It's almost like a giant cross, like both sides of the temple meet in the center. And there is a circular dip in the ground. Not really a pit, it's only about four feet down. But it's filled with a coarse sand, and as you guys walk up to that edge, each monk acknowledging you as you pass quietly, you can hear the gentle chanting in the distance of low, rumbling Gregorian voices, (chanting). And there, sitting in the center of this open circular sand patch, is the Earthbreaker himself. He is sitting there, legs crossed, arms resting at the edge of his knees, eyes closed. You can see, even from here for those who haven't seen him before, he wears simple free-flowing pants of a dark reddish color with a gold trim on the sides, but they're tattered towards the bottom. He has a one-shoulder wrap across the front there and these large prayer beads that hang around his neck. His skin is very dark and weathered by sun and training, and he is probably the most muscular human being you have seen for his proportional form, he is a human being built for discipline and physical martial training and battle. Older though, still you can see his long grey beard that rests about middle to his chest, the balding on the front a little bit, the rest of his grey hair rests to his mid-back, and he just sits there quietly in the center. The rest of the monks have gathered up and begun to form around the circle.
Travis: How many monks, would you say?
Matt: Right now, about 15?
Travis: One-five.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Are they talking at all or are they all super-quiet?
Matt: Super-quiet.
Travis: I walk up to within 20 feet of Earthbreaker Groon.
Matt: Okay, so you leap down into the sandpit?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so, you guys on the side. Grog, you leap off.
Travis: How deep is it lowered?
Matt: You don't know how deep it is, but it's, it's not, it's hard sand, it's packed, so you just kind of--
Travis: Yeah, but I meant the depression, is it like a couple feet?
Matt: Right, the depression's like an inch.
Travis: Okay, cool.
Matt: Oh, you mean the depression into the actual ground?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: About four feet.
Travis: Oh, shit. Yeah. So.
Matt: So you vault into it in a bound.
Travis: Does he move at all?
Matt: No. He's still facing a little bit away from you in the far corner.
Travis: I put my fist in my hand and I bow slightly. Does he move at all?
Matt: The silence is broken immediately by a low, rumbling voice that seems to have no particular source in the vicinity where you stand. It says, "You come because your lands now harbor a terrible conflagration. How do you think Groon can assist?" Still facing away from you.
Travis: We have traveled near and far, great Grood.
Marisha: It's like Sesame Street.
Travis: And we would like to request upon you a moment of your time?
Will: Why is he doing the talking? Why is he doing the talking?
Matt: As most of you noticed this time, his name is Groon. (laughter)
Matt: At which point he stands up, and, you know, would only come to about your sternum, height-wise, but he's just this tense, every muscle is seemingly, there's not an ounce of fat on this body and--
Travis: Like a protein shake.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Paleo.
Matt: Turns around towards you and says, "You stray from the darkness that I warned you, but this current distraction is too great. Even your blood is drawn to the flames of promise and power. This shall be a test to see if you will break against the shadow."
Sam: What shall be a test?
Laura: What's the test?
Matt: "I know many things, Grog Strongjaw."
Travis: He said my full name.
Matt: "But such knowledge is earned, not given."
Marisha: (whispers) Shit, you might have to fight this motherfucker.
Matt: "Where do you find your strength?"
Liam: (whispers) What's he talking about, Grog?
Matt: As you're thinking, in a blinding instant you see a flash of movement and, like a dagger in your stomach, his elbow is (impact sound). (groaning)
Matt: Moved three feet in an instant and has slammed you right in the center of your abdomen. The breath just escapes you as you fall back, unable to really catch yourself, and just land flat on your back in the sand.
Travis: (wheezing sounds)
Marisha: We're all hanging back.
Matt: Puts his arm down.
Marisha: Just watching.
Matt: "Strongjaw. Where do you find your strength?"
Travis: In my anger.
Matt: "You walk between worlds. Weakness in mind or weakness in conviction. What do you stand for? Where do you find your strength?" At which point, as you're getting up, there's another blinding flash for a second and your feet are left out from under you. Go ahead and make an athletics check, because you're now prepared for this one.
Will: Jeez.
Taliesin: Gonna get smackdown.
Travis: 19.
Matt: Your feet go out from under you as you slam onto your back, you just barely caught your breath before it's almost knocked out again. He's looking down at you this time, once again, his eyes just white. "Choose. Choose the two here who would save you."
Travis: (whispers) Pike's not here.
Matt: "Who would push you to your potential. Choose your bloody muses."
Sam: Does he mean us, or?
Travis: Do they have to be here?
Matt: He looks over to the rest of you on the side of the pit. "Choose."
Travis: (sighs) I choose my buddy Pike.
Sam: She's not here.
Travis: I don't care, I just say it anyway. I choose Vax and I choose Scanlan.
Sam: We give him his strength, sir.
Matt: As you finish that sentence, two monks that you failed to notice were behind you shove both of you into the pit. Make acrobatics checks, both of you guys.
Sam: (laughing nervously) Not my kind of fight! Oh, I got a ten.
Liam: 34.
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Matt: You tumble, catch Grog's arm, and lift him onto his feet as you land yourself at his side. Scanlan is face-down in the sand.
Sam: Are we talking still?
Liam: I would just like to point out that I am mostly sober.
Matt: Groon takes two steps back and just closes his eyes and puts his arms at his sides. "Now. Show me your conviction."
Marisha: Oh snap!
Matt: I need you three to roll initiative.
All: Oh!
Liam: Natural 20! 25 off a natural 20!
Will: Oh snap! Shit's getting real.
Matt: The statues that're set at the edge of this, we're gonna put you, Grog, there--
Laura: Look at the coolness that's been created on this map!
Matt: And boom.
Laura: So cool! This is awesome, Matt!
Mary: Look how little they are!
Matt: I'll just move it this way a little bit, just so you guys can see, there we go.
Liam: I'm peeing just a little bit.
Mary: Oh my goodness.
Laura: Hey you guys, don't die!
Matt: All right, so. Let me get Groon's sheet out here.
Sam: Is it just us against one person?
Travis: Yep.
Laura: He's really strong.
Marisha: He's gonna kick your guys's asses.
Will: Can you see, do you want to switch seats so you can see? Okay.
Sam: No, I can see on the screen.
Matt: Okay, so. 25 to 20?
Liam: 25 off a natural 20.
Matt: All right. 20 to 15?
Travis: 19.
Sam: 16.
Matt: 16, Scanlan. All right, perfect. First up's first. You, Vax. Just standing with his arm up.
Liam: Click my Boots of Haste. (laughter)
Mary: Click 'em hard!
Liam: And use my bonus action to hide behind Grog's thigh and hold my turn.
Matt: Until what, what's your trigger?
Liam: Until Grog moves towards the Earthbreaker.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: When he does it I'm gonna go with him and fight him if I can.
Matt: Well, your movement is in your turn, it's your action you have to hold.
Liam: Oh boy. Oh boy.
Matt: So. Are you gonna wait behind him?
Liam: Well, let me just think for ten seconds only.
Matt: Can't, you've got-- dude.
Liam: Yeah, okay, so, I use my bonus action to hide. Do I need to roll for that?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Liam: Yeah. That's a--
Laura: Ohh.
Liam: No, that's fine, because remember, I'm me. So that is, that's a 25.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I guess behind Grog.
Matt: He has no idea where you are.
Liam: No, I'm going to throw fucking daggers at this guy!
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Because I'm first. Oh my god. I am. First is 24?
Matt: 24 hits.
Liam: And then, so I used my bonus action to hide, which means I can do two, right? So the second is not that great.
Travis: I don't know what you're so worried about.
Liam: Using Luck. Better. Second is a 30.
Matt: Yeah, both hit.
Liam: Okay, now. This is, I'm the first to attack, which means that it is-- Ooh, it's a 19.
Matt: What's the range increment on this?
Liam: I'm Sharpshooter, man.
Matt: Right, but what's the max range?
Liam: 60.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine.
Liam: Okay, so. I'm hidden behind Grog so it should be sneak attack, and I'm the first to go so it's a crit.
Matt: You're the first to go, it is a crit. It is not a sneak attack.
Liam: It's not a sneak attack? Even though I used my bonus to hide behind Grog's big fat leg?
Matt: Where could you possibly be, Vax?
Liam: He's huge! All right, okay.
Matt: Where could you have possibly hidden from his sight in the middle of this giant open sandy arena?
Will: He's disappeared!
Liam: I'm drunk and fighting in a pit!
Matt: It's okay. But it is double damage.
Liam: All right, all right. So there is no sneak attack, but it is crit, right? Because I'm the first to attack?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Well no, it's surprise, not the first to attack. He is not surprised.
Liam: He's not surprised.
Matt: No. It's not first, it's just surprised.
Liam: Oh god. I'm drunk, tell me what's going on.
Matt: You hit him twice, roll damage.
Marisha: I know, I'm so confused.
Liam: One plus seven's eight, and then eight. Eight and eight.
Laura: (laughs) That's almost as good as all those other things you did today.
Matt: The first one, he deflects with his hand and it cuts the arm and you can see the little slash of damage it dealt. The second one, he's gonna use his reaction to do deflect missiles.
Marisha: That's cool. That's some Bruce Lee shit.
Matt: (laughs) Yeah. He reduces the damage entirely, spends one of his ki points, he catches the dagger and throws it right back at you.
Liam: Okay, I'm gonna use Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Not back at you, though. Because you're currently behind Grog.
Sam: Hi! (laughter)
Laura: Are you still face-down in the sand?
Sam: What's going on?
Matt: That's 18 to hit.
Sam: That hits.
Matt: Okay. So you take 12 points of piercing damage. As he chucks Vax's dagger back at you, it sinks into your shoulder suddenly before it vanishes and returns to your belt.
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry.
Sam: All I've heard was "Scanlan.'" (laughter)
Sam: "My buddy Scanlan."
Marisha: (laughs) That's true, that is all you heard.
Matt: All right. Now it is Groon's turn. Groon is going to rush up to the front of Grog-- actually no, to the side here so you're both in combat, technically, and is going to make a flurry of blows attack using another one of his ki points. So that's gonna be four attacks, all against you, Grog.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: So that's a 27, hits, I'm pretty sure. Cocked. 26.
Travis: (laughing) 27 and 26?
Matt: 16?
Travis: Oh, it misses! (laughter)
Matt: And 28.
Travis: Yeah, that hits too.
Marisha: What the fuck is this guy's base? What?
Will: This is when you want to be fighting Wil Wheaton. (laughter)
Matt: Okay, you take--
Taliesin: He's doing a lot of math.
Matt: 31 points of bludgeoning damage. And his kick just-- whack!-- right across the jaw. You haven't even raged yet, and the pain is intense, your vision goes white for a second. And go ahead and make a dex saving throw.
Laura: Oh man!
Travis: Seven.
Matt: As his fourth action, sweeps your feet out from under you and you are knocked prone on the ground.
Marisha: Oh, shit. This guy's a badass.
Laura: He gets four actions?
Marisha: Monks, man.
Matt: That's his turn. Grog, you're up now.
Will: And we can't do anything?
Taliesin: Well, if you want to get involved.
Travis: (panting) I. Would like. To rage. I'd like to stand up, please. (laughter)
Travis: Do I have to roll for that?
Matt: No no no, you just use half your movement for that.
Travis: I take out Craven Edge, and I'd like to swing twice against him.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: That's a 25?
Matt: 25 hits.
Travis: 25 hits, that's good. And a 17.
Matt: Misses.
Travis: Misses. 18. 21 points of damage.
Matt: 21 points of damage. All righty.
Travis: And roll for the DC.
Matt: Yeah, he makes it.
Travis: Son of a bitch.
Matt: (laughs) Sorry. All right, so.
Travis: Can I move, or is getting up my movement?
Matt: You can move, yeah.
Travis: I want to move around, just stay right next to him, but move around behind him.
Matt: Right there, you mean?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Vax is there, then that would be your flanking potential there. Okay. Cool. That ends your turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Did Grog moving activate Vax? Didn't you hold your turn or something?
Laura: No, he didn't.
Will: He chucked knives.
Sam: I'll stand up out of the sand. And I will, eeeee, I will-- (laughter)
Sam: I will look extremely weak and I will sing a song to him. (laughter)
Sam: I will attempt to cast, with the horn, Eyebite on him, and I'll sing, (singing) My my my, eye bitten twice shy. (laughter)
Will: Wow. Best fight ever.
Matt: All righty, and that is Eyebite. All right, so it's a-- you said wisdom save?
Sam: It's a wisdom save.
Matt: All right. What's the DC?
Sam: It's 19.
Matt: No, he fails it. So what are you doing?
Sam: This is a good question. I don't know what to do. Should I make him fall asleep? I think no. Because we want this fight to continue, that would sort of end it, won't it?
Laura: Do whatever you want, I dunno.
Will: That's a great look.
Taliesin: Do something funny.
Sam: Yeah, I want him to go to sleep in the sand.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Sam: Just curl up in the fetal position.
Matt: Okay. Okay, what happens is, as soon as you move around, Grog, and you sing at him? He glances over at you for a second and his eyes roll back and he (impact sound) and just falls back in the sand, unconscious.
Liam: Scanlan Shorthalt.
Mary: Ladies and gentlemen.
Sam: That was a quick fight.
Matt: At which point, all the monks currently are gasping in immediate reaction. (laughter)
Matt: As he's currently unconscious and affected by Eyebite. All right, do you want to move or are you staying where you are on your turn? Bonus action?
Sam: I mean, he can't swipe at me if I walk away, so I'm gonna get away from him. Although he can move super fast. I'll walk a little bit away.
Travis: Now in the middle of the room.
Sam: And I'll inspire Grog, in case this fight continues, and I will sing--
Matt: Actually, you know what? No, go ahead. I forgot to read something. Go ahead. My own fault.
Sam: I will sing  (singing) Hail to the goliaths, hail victory, blood on the warpath, fight for Vax and me. (laughter)
Travis: That's the best.
Matt: Take your d10.
Sam: (whispers) That's the Redskins' fight song. (yelling)
Liam: That is amazing!
Taliesin: Thank you, that was genius.
Travis: I ain't using it. (yelling)
Mary: As the worlds collide.
Matt: That ends Scanlan's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Grog, Grog, Grog, do we really want to do this? He's down, he's asleep!
Sam: What do we do?
Liam: Are we doing this, are we really doing this? He's asleep.
Travis: What, like, so if we hit him, does he wake up?
Sam: He will, but you get, you'll get a few licks in.
Liam: We're not trying to kill him, we want him to work with us.
Travis: You fucking end him and you end him now.
Sam: Yeah, kill him.
Liam: Excuse me? All right, so, I use disen-- no, I don't have to.
Sam: No, he's asleep.
Liam: Yeah, okay. So I got two daggers in my hands, and they spin around in my hand, and I just start beating him in the head.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Sam: I assume this is a sneak attack since he can't see it.
Liam: Yes, it is, because Grog's right there.
Sam: He will wake up after this.
Liam: 21.
Travis: Yeah, but he might not hit him anyway, he rolls for it.
Sam: I don't know, actually.
Matt: As you go and attempt to strike him-- You had advantage on the attacks, by the way, because he's on the ground.
Liam: Oh, well then it is a 32.
Matt: Okay. Good. That hits.
Liam: And then the second one is a 27 and the third one is a 17.
Matt: First two hit.
Liam: First two hit, and the first one is sneak attack with the blunt edge.
Matt: Right. Which is doubled because he's unconscious.
Liam: Yeah it is.
Matt: Melee attack within five feet.
Liam: Oh, I'm so sorry! Nine. Plus-- Whoa. That is ten, 16, 22, 23, 25, is 50? Plus the-- 59. 59 for the first.
Matt: 59. Hoo.
Liam: Ooh, that's the wrong one. And then the second dagger does ten.
Matt: Ten. So as you-- whack!-- hit him in the head, he immediately comes back to consciousness.
Liam: And I'm gonna use my movement to run around and to roll around behind Grog's buttocks.
Matt: Okay. As you move aside, even on the ground, prone, he swings his leg out to try and catch you as you're running past.
Liam: Acrobatics?
Matt: He has disadvantage on this anyway. That is still a 24 to hit.
Liam: To hit? Oh, that's an attack. Even though he was unconscious?
Matt: Well, he woke up after you slammed him, second attack hits, and in reaction as he sees you rush off, he kicks his leg up and manages to catch you.
Liam: Yeah, I'm feeling that.
Matt: It doesn't manage to trip you, but it does deal--
Liam: Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: So you deal half the damage on that. All right. So you take-- What would be 12 points of damage, you take six points of bludgeoning damage.
Liam: Ah, fucking ankle. Come on.
Will: It was still uncanny.
Matt: It was quite uncanny. All right, that ends your turn?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: All right. It's now his turn. All right, so.
Liam: I'm so acrobatic.
Travis: We're waiting to see if he's awake or not.
Matt: So yeah, until the spell ends, you can use your action every turn to try and give him another effect if you wanted to, Scanlan. So he still has Eyebite, but he's conscious.
Sam: Can I change the effect, or does it always have to be--
Matt: You can if you want to, when it comes to your next turn, but it has to be on your turn to use your action to do it. He gets up using half his movement. Which is fine. He's going to, as he looks over and you can see him glance to the side of Grog and see where you are, as the giant crack in the side of his head and the blood that's trickling down the side of his face, he just rushes around, still in melee with you so he doesn't get an attack of opportunity, and he's gonna go unarmed attacks on you for three. Natural 20. That's a 17.
Liam: No.
Matt: With your haste, yeah, you get a bonus, so that's a miss. And that is a 25.
Liam: That hits. Two of those hit.
Matt: All right. So the crit, 28 points of bludgeoning damage. And the last one is gonna be 14 points of bludgeoning damage. And he's going to use three ki points. As he comes around, elbows you to the side of the face, you just weren't expecting it and it cracks you and you feel like a tooth crack and the pain sears through your jaw and you're like, ugh! And then he brings his lower hand and (impact) hits you right in the center of the abdomen, and it hits you, and it hurts, but it's not as impactful as you thought it would be for the force, but you feel like this strange, like, quivering vibration in your midsection, like almost like the muscles are spasming uncontrollably and you don't quite understand why. That is going to end his turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: No! And I go into a frenzied rage. If it's gonna be an ass-beating we take, we might as well just get on with it. And I'll use reckless attack and Great Weapon Master against him.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Travis: Which means he gets advantage on everything against me, but fuck it, he's hitting anyway. Oh, 19, so close. 28.
Matt: 28 hits.
Travis: 23?
Matt: 23 hits.
Travis: 16.
Matt: Misses.
Travis: Damn it. Those were high. Okay.
Laura: You could've used your inspiration.
Sam: It's true.
Travis: I'm not listening to any of you. (laughter)
Travis: 32 on the first one.
Matt: Nice.
Will: That's hysterical. RG3 could've helped.
Travis: Four, nine, 17, 27 on the second one, and the third one missed.
Matt: Third missed, all right. Succeeds on the first save with an 18-- and a 19, yeah. Saves both hits from Craven Edge. As you slam the blade into him twice, he's trying to parry them, and he's catching the blade off to the side, but the strength is too strong and you end up jamming it into his forearm. As you pull away, the blood streaks out. Each hit, he's still focused on you, and he's not showing any pain, he's not grimacing. You're just seeing the wounds being had and he's just still intent on moving and his expression focused on you.
Travis: He made both those checks okay?
Matt: Yeah. And at that moment he looks at you and says, "You carry such a dark weapon with you." That's all he says. Is that the end of your turn?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Scanlan.
Sam: He's still eyebitten.
Matt: Correct, yes. Actually, let's see, he has to save at the end of his turn. Which, he rolled a one, so no.
Sam: All right. Instead of sleeping this time, I would like him to just get sick. Be sick. I want him to be sick now.
Mary: What kind of sick?
Laura: Like, pukey or like the other one?
Sam: Oh, he has like diarrhea.
Marisha: That's the worst.
Laura: Oh man. That's so embarrassing.
Matt: All righty. Yeah. As you keep focusing, you can see his form shifts a little bit, and you swear you hear the cramping of someone's abdominals in the distance, like an unhappy digestive tract.
Sam: You didn't sleep well, did you? No?
Liam: Like a tree cracking in the wind from this guy.
Sam: And I will turn to Vax this time and inspire him, and I will say, (singing) Kill that monk-y douchebag, white boy. Kill that monk-y douchebag right. Take out your daggers and kill that monk-y douchebag 'til he dies. (laughter)
Matt: Take your d10 inspiration.
Liam: Okay, got it, got it, got it.
Matt: All right, that brings us to the top. Is that the end of your turn, are you gonna move or anything else--
Sam: I'll move a little further away, it won't really help.
Matt: All right. You're up.
Liam: He's still pressed up against Grog, right?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: All right, I'm gonna use disengage and pivot around Grog, right, run all around the circle and get behind Scanlan.
Sam: Oh shit. I was trying to get away from him!
Matt: Like that?
Liam: Yeah. And I'm gonna throw two daggers at him, yeah. The first one's, okay, natural 20! Wait, it's natural 20 on top of a sneak attack, what happens?
Matt: Yeah, you double the sneak-attack damage.
Liam: You double the sneak-attack?
Matt: It's a critical hit, all the dice you roll for a critical hit you double.
Travis: Picked you for a reason, add that shit up, man.
Matt: And then you add the ability modifier at the end. So yes.
Liam: Let me take a moment. (laughter)
Matt: Rogues, baby.
Marisha: Get the blood back in your head.
Liam: Okay, that's a nine. Okay. Think I want to savor this.
Will: He looks giddy, he looks giddy, it's great.
Liam: All right. So. Oh my god. (counting)
Travis: It's so juicy, so savory.
Liam: 23 doubled, quadrupled--
Matt: Not quadrupled. Doubled.
Liam: 23. 28.
Matt: It's doubled, not quadrupled.
Liam: Not quadrupled, oh! So sneak attack is not doubled, then on top-- All right.
Marisha: But that's what you said. That's not what you said!
Matt: It's not a surprise attack.
Liam: So it doesn't stack.
Matt: No.
Liam: Yeah, but he's, he's up against Grog. So I get--
Matt: Which is meaning you get sneak attack. So you're doing sneak-attack damage on him, you critically hit, so you just double your sneak attack damage.
Sam: Just take your 80 points of damage, not your 160 points.
Liam: So I double sneak-attack damage.
Matt: Yeah. You said quadruple, it's not quadruple, it's just times two.
Liam: 23, the sneak-attack damage is--
Laura: That's 28. Times two.
Liam: 56. All right. Yeah.
Mary: That's good, there's no disappointment there.
Taliesin: And now you add your knife.
Liam: 68.
Matt: Oh, total of 68? Gotcha.
Liam: Critical hit on a sneak attack. Got it, got it, got it.
Matt: He is going to use a ki point to deflect missiles.
Liam: I'm gonna use my last bit of Luck so that he has to roll again.
Matt: Okay. All right. It's not an attack roll on this yet, just so you're aware.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: This is him just reducing the damage he takes from it.
Liam: Oh, all right.
Matt: So that is a total of, he reduces the damage by 13, he still takes the impact, but he manages to slow the blade with his hands before it finds itself in his chest and he rips it out, you can see the spray of blood that hits in the sand across the front before the dagger disappears from his grip.
Liam: And I duck behind Scanlan.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Don't hide behind me!
Liam: Yeah, sure. It's, that was a four, ten.
Matt: Nope. This one--
Liam: No, I rolled, I rolled a bunch of times. Didn't I roll a bunch of times? Okay, all right, well. She rolled a 20.
Matt: For nothing.
Liam: I rolled a, oh that did fine. It's a 27.
Matt: Wait, so you did a total of 60-something damage on him from the one attack?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, got you, yes, the second one does--
Liam: Second one is ten.
Matt: Yeah. So the second one attack hits. Go ahead and roll for it. Or roll for damage.
Liam: Nine.
Matt: Nine, okay. Cool. Cool.
Liam: I'm scared to death, which is why the math is so bad.
Matt: That's good. Well, as it comes back to Groon's turn, Groon, you can see the blood is just pouring out of the wound that you left, he takes one hand and just (impact sound) slams it really hard, and it just kind of, the impact sears the wound. Cauterizing it.
Liam: Don't want to be fighting you.
Matt: Still looking at you. He puts his hand out and does this, and that quivering in your stomach you felt earlier begins to shake and the vibrations begin to spread through your entire body. I need you to make a constitution saving throw? Yeah.
Sam: You've got inspiration still.
Laura: Does that work on saves?
Liam: Plus inspiration.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: It's a 23.
Matt: 23. That is a success. You manage to just stave it off as you can feel it about to tear your insides apart, and you just tense real fast and the vibrations slowly fade. No effect.
Sam: No effect!
Matt: Would've been 10d10 necrotic damage.
Sam: 10d10!
Marisha: What happened, like a chestburster, like came out of him?
Matt: It's called Quivering Palm, it's a monk ability.
Liam: It's Uma Thurman, it's fucking Kill Bill.
Marisha: The five-point exploding palm technique.
Will: The five-point exploding palm technique.
Matt: He's going to use another ki point, a bonus action, as he goes into a defensive stance, a familiar one that you've seen before.
Travis: Before I whooped somebody's ass.
Matt: Yeah. But into this fully defensive, looking about and keeping his eyes aware of the entirety of his surroundings. And is going to stay right there. That brings us to Grog.
Travis: Piece of shit, I don't know what that stance is-- I chop at him some more with Craven Edge! I don't know, can I do one Great Weapon Master and the other two just regular?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Okay. I'm gonna do that.
Matt: Are you doing reckless attacks or not?
Travis: Yeah, reckless.
Matt: Okay. His patient defense gives you disadvantage on all attacks-- He just nullifies it, so you just have one roll per attack.
Travis: 16?
Matt: Misses. Just knocks the blade out with his own hand, you hear it (impact) off to the side.
Travis: 16.
Matt: This time he actually catches with the two sides of his hand and throws it back towards you.
Sam: You could be inspired, god damn it!
Mary: It's right there.
Travis: I'm gonna use my other d10 that's not tainted, so not this one.
Sam: All you have to do is pledge allegiance to the Washington football team. (laughter)
Will: Wow.
Travis: 27.
Matt: 27. He goes to try and catch it, but you change the direction of the blade at the last minute and find the side of his flesh, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Okay. So 12. 19.
Matt: He does make his save on that.
Travis: 29. Damn it, he does?
Matt: 29 damage.
Travis: 29. All that.
Matt: He's got a decent constitution.
Travis: Yeah, you think?
Matt: All right, so the third blade finally sinks in about two inches into his clavicle area and probably would snap the clavicle bone if he hadn't put his hands up and caught as much of the impact as he could, and then throws it back again and just kicks you away to get a little bit of distance.
Travis: Shit, really? Little distance, or?
Matt: It's just like a foot, just away from being clenched up.
Travis: Okay. Can I move opposite of where my two lads are so I stay behind him again?
Matt: Right there? Yeah, you can do that. Go for it. All right, that ends your turn?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up. Well, let me see actually if he resists the-- Nope.
Sam: Still sick.
Matt: Actually, actually no, remembering this, because I kept forgetting to do it before, but that's fine, he's gonna use his legendary resistance to automatically succeed, so he no longer has Eyebite.
Sam: Oh, so he's done.
Laura: He's not shitting himself anymore.
Mary: No. But the stench is great.
Matt: So sickness fades. He spent last round not doing any actual physical attacks for that reason.
Sam: All right. Well. I'm far away from him, but Grog's right next to him, so I probably shouldn't do anything too terrible.
Travis: Do it! Do it!
Liam: But he's a sponge!
Travis: Do it! If you don't do it, he will, do it.
Marisha: That's why we have Grog around.
Sam: I'll join in the bludgeon-fest, and I will cast (sings) Bigby's Hand! And I will, I'll make it come right next to him, sort of between him and Grog? I can't get between him and Grog.
Matt: There you go. Not between them, no, but you can put it like next to him or behind him.
Sam: Okay. To the side, to the side would be good. And just punch! Just a couple punches. Just throwing some punches.
Taliesin: Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself.
Matt: Make a melee spell attack.
Sam: Melee spell attack.
Matt: Got it, melee spell attack.
Sam: What do I add?
Matt: You add your spell attack modifier, which should be on your spell page.
Liam: On your same page, your spell page.
Sam: Spell attack bonus-- Okay. 27.
Matt: 27, that's a hit. As the hand appears to his right, he's still focusing on Grog and glances over for a second and tries to do a deflection, technically he's still in his defense stance, though. So roll twice, because he does have disadvantage for attacks on him.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's good.
Sam: That was a natural 20.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: But the disadvantage, so the 27. Yes. Oh wait, now I roll for damage.
Matt: Yep.
Sam: With Bigby's Hand. I rarely do this.
Travis: That's true, yeah.
Matt: 4d8 force damage.
Sam: 4d8.
Laura: You need to do that more, that's pretty good.
Liam: Come on, Scanbo.
Sam: I'll just roll this one four times, it's fine. 17?
Matt: 17 damage.
Sam: 4d8, right?
Matt: Yep. So as Bigby's Hand pulls back with a giant fist, the fingers cracking in an arcane echo, whack! Slams into his side, he holds himself strong and actually slides about seven inches in the sand from the impact. And you can see him shake off his arm from the hit. Yeah, that hurt.
Sam: Decent, decent. And I will inspire Grog again, with a little ditty, I will say, (singing) You're a psycho killer, with a bearded face, Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog. Run r-- That's fine.
Matt: All right, take your d10. (laughter)
Matt: All right. Vax, you're up.
Liam: I just drop to my knees so I can aim better and right over Scanlan's shoulder, dagger, dagger, dagger.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Okay, first one is a one. So that misses. Second one is a 23.
Matt: 23. You're rolling disadvantage on all these, right?
Liam: Disadvantage? For what?
Matt: For all these attacks, because he's still in his patient defense stance.
Liam: Oh shite.
Matt: So what was this roll you just got--
Liam: Well, the first one was a one and a--
Matt: Yeah, first one missed. The second one was a 23 and what did you roll?
Liam: I don't remember what it was. Sorry.
Matt: Roll again, it's fine.
Liam: All right, so this is the second attack. That is a 17.
Matt: Misses.
Liam: Third attack is a 21.
Matt: 21 misses. (groaning)
Matt: So all three daggers come at him and he just dodges one right off the head, another one he parries out of the way, and the third one he does a crescent kick-- whack!-- and knocks the dagger out of the air that spins off to the side before it returns to your belt.
Liam: And just under my breath I say, "So fucking cool." (laughter)
Matt: At the end of your turn before it's his turn he's gonna go ahead and use one action point to use Like the Wind, where he moves his speed without taking attacks of opportunity. He turns and rushes up to Scanlan.
Sam: I'm a little boy!
Matt: Starting his turn, now, he's gonna come for you, Scanlan, he's gonna go ahead and do a flurry of blows against you.
Laura: Oh no, Scanlan!
Matt: So. Scanlan. First attack is 29.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Natural one, fails on the second one.
Sam: Okay, I'll use Cutting Words on the last one.
Matt: Okay, well the third one is a 20. And the fourth one is a 31.
Travis: Jesus.
Matt: So three hits.
Sam: But I'm using Cutting Words on the third one to try to--
Liam: You said the last one.
Sam: No, I said the third one.
Marisha: It doesn't matter, they all suck.
Matt: Whichever one you want. So the first one hits, Cutting Words to reduce the attack on the--
Sam: On the one that was a 20.
Matt: Yeah. So go ahead and roll your d10.
Sam: Okay. Six.
Matt: Six. What's your AC?
Sam: 17.
Matt: Yeah, no, so you manage to, what do you shout at him as he's doing these punches against you?
Sam: I sing, (singing) No no no no, don't phunk with my heart! (laughter)
Matt: He cocks his head like a confused puppy for a second and the fist just hits air above your head.
Travis: You've gotta be kidding me, man.
Matt: However, you do take 14 points of bludgeoning damage from the first strike, and another 14 points of bludgeoning damage, so a total of 28 points of bludgeoning damage from two hits. Go ahead and make a dex saving throw, if you could.
Sam: Dex, dex, dex.
Taliesin: Four.
Sam: 16. Oh, plus four? Really? Okay. Oh, yeah. Saw that for some reason there's a plus four there. 20.
Matt: 20's what you need. His last hit, he's trying to kick you square in the chest and knock you off your feet, and while it hits you, it actually forces you back into Vax, and Vax holds you up and you manage to keep on your feet.
Liam: Whoa, buddy.
Sam: Oh, hi. I'm between two strong men.
Liam: Debatable.
Sam: I'm lucky Pierre.
Matt: Or no, it's Grog's turn, it's Grog's turn, because you just took yours, yeah.
Travis: It's my turn? Yeah, I just keep swinging away.
Matt: So you're gonna move up to him?
Travis: Yes, please.
Matt: Oh, and as a note, I need you to make a concentration check for both of those hits, they were 14 damage each, so, and you have Warcaster, right?
Sam: Oh, yes. Oh yes.
Matt: So go ahead and make constitution checks. Constitution. Let me look at this.
Sam: That's 11 plus two is 13, right? Not great, not great. And 14. 13 and 14.
Matt: Okay, yeah, that's gonna end concentration, Bigby's Hand off the table.
Sam: (gasps) Bigby's Hand is gone.
Matt: Too much damage for you on that one. So from the impact of the blows you just managed, the spell fizzles from your mind and the hand dissipates into the distance. All right, now, Grog.
Travis: At the end of his turn, did he go back into his defensive pose?
Matt: No.
Travis: Okay, great. Okay, so, reckless attack. That's, let's make it Great Weapon Master with the inspiration. 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: You've gotta say Great Weapon Master before you roll, by the way.
Travis: Should I do it for the next one, then?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Okay. So that one didn't.
Matt: Because it can't be like, oh, that doesn't hit, I'm not gonna do Great Weapon Master yet, you have to get the penalty before you roll.
Travis: Right, that makes sense. Right. So it was a 29, no, I mean it wasn't. What?
Matt: You said it was a 24, for that one it would've been a twenty--- it hit regardless.
Travis: Okay. Hit regardless.
Matt: So yeah. So the first one was just a regular hit.
Travis: So we'll do the third one will be Great Weapon Master. This is disadvantage. Come on, where are the damn crits? 20.
Matt: 20 misses.
Travis: Yep, okay, this is Great Weapon Master. With adva-- with the inspiraton.
Matt: Yeah. So.
Travis: 28? No, minus five. 23.
Matt: 23 just hits. (cheering)
Matt: So a regular hit, and then a Great Weapon Master hit.
Travis: Okay. Six, 11, 19 is the first one.
Matt: 19 damage, all right.
Travis: Fuck. Nine, 17, 27.
Matt: 27, got it. Both of the strikes, makes his save, makes his save.
Travis: (sputters) Not once?
Matt: It's a 12 DC, it's not a very hard DC for--
Travis: Yeah, but he's gotta roll shitty sometimes.
Matt: He probably will eventually. So anyway. As you're striking the blades at him, the pain, he's just taking the pain to his back, now, because he's facing Scanlan, and both times hack into the back of his shoulderblades and the exposed muscle you can see as the blade draws back you can see the muscle and the blood arcing after each draw of the weapon. However, he glances over his shoulder at you as you finish your second blow and at the end of your turn he's gonna use two action points to use Whirlwind of Blows--
Travis: Can I move? Oh, I already moved.
Matt: You already moved, yeah. I mean, you can keep moving if you wanted to move away.
Travis: I wanted to move in between him and Scanlan, just wrap around.
Matt: You can't move between, but you can get there if you want.
Travis: Okay, that'd be good.
Matt: Okay. So he's gonna get an attack on everyone within range of his punches, which would be you and Scanlan. That is gonna be a 26 against you.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: And a natural 20 against Scanlan.
Sam: That doesn't hit. That doesn't hit. (laughter)
Matt: First to you, Grog, that is 18 points of bludgeoning damage. Halved to nine. And Scanlan, that is six, no, sorry-- 24 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Ah, that's not bad. I'll be fine.
Matt: All right. Now it's Scanlan's turn.
Sam: Oh, shit, I get to do more shit?
Travis: Where you at?
Sam: I'm fine.
Taliesin: Looking a little rough.
Sam: Fine. Monk's got nothing on me.
Matt: So last turn you missed all three on him, remember?
Liam: Oh, thanks.
Sam: So he's right next to me, he's right next to all of us. Okay. Well, I will-- he's right next to me?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: And no one's behind him. So I will just Lightning Bolt him. From right there. Can I do that?
Matt: You can, yeah. So as you're there in front, you just reach back--
Sam: Oh, I've got something in my pocket, (yells). (laughter)
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: You let the lightning out of the bottle.
Matt: What's the DC? I imagine this was out of your--
Sam: Is this my spell DC? So 19.
Matt: 19 with the hand cone, so you were like, hup, yaaaa!
Sam: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: 19.
Taliesin: Need some d6's, man?
Matt: He's going to use another of his legendary resistances to make the save. And he has evasion, which means dex save for half, he gets no damage on his success, so as you do Lightning Bolt, he literally just goes into the splits as the bolt streaks over his head.
Liam: He Van Damme'd it!
Matt: Slams one of the nearby pillars, and as you realize that, you look down at him as he squeezes his legs back together and lands right back on his feet.
Will: Oh, god. He took no Van Damme-age. (laughter)
Sam: He's fast as lightning. Damn it.
Matt: Is that your turn?
Sam: I mean, that's all I can do. You know what, I'll use my bonus action to heal myself a bit.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Sam: I'll use Healing Word on myself at third level. So that's two, 3d4 plus five, right? Ten, ten plus five. Ten plus five. Okay, 15. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, I'll take that.
Matt: Sure, go for it. All right, that ends your turn, Vax, you're up.
Liam: You might already know this, but I'm wearing my Cloak of Displacement, so he should be at disadvantage to hit me.
Matt: Good to know going forward.
Liam: Yeah, thanks. I want to use one action to grab Scanlan by his purple shirt and rip him and pull him away.
Matt: That's gonna be your action.
Liam: Sure.
Matt: So you won't have any attacks this round.
Liam: With Boots of Haste on?
Matt: In order to get the additional, well, actually no, you would get one attack from the haste. You would. Your offhand attack you don't get unless you're doing an attack action, so you get one attack.
Liam: That's fine, that's fine, I rip him, I yank him away and throw the little bugger.
Sam: As I fly through the air, I'm looking up to see if Kashaw's putting any moves on Keyleth or anything.
Will: Great fight, man!
Marisha: (screaming)
Will: Great fight!
Marisha: Oh god!
Liam: And then throw a dagger past Grog at him. For-- not that great. 19.
Matt: 19?
Liam: 19, that's it.
Matt: Misses, yeah.
Liam: Okay, so I threw him, I threw a dagger and missed, and I just juke to the right and get behind Grog.
Matt: Okay. So move there. At the end of your turn, he's gonna use his last action point to do an unarmed attack against Grog. That's gonna be a 21?
Travis: Pretty sure.
Matt: It hits? Okay.
Marisha: Yeah, pretty sure.
Matt: You take ten points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Halved to five.
Matt: Half. He's gonna use another ki point to, I need you to make a constitution save.
Travis: Okay. 17.
Matt: 17. As he turns back and slams his fist right in the center of your clavicle, you feel a crack in the sternum and your whole body, all your muscles just seize up and you are currently stunned from a stunning strike until the end of his next turn.
Liam: We got this, guys.
Matt: However, it's now his next turn.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: But you're still stunned. He is now going to, since you don't have a threat to him, he's going to swing around, jump between the two of them, and he's gonna do a flurry of blows, two punches against each of you. Against Scanlan, that's a 17?
Sam: That's my armor class, 17.
Matt: That hits, okay. Second one is a 17 again.
Sam: Can I use my Cutting Words on that one?
Matt: Do you have any more uses of your bardic inspiration?
Sam: It's once per turn.
Matt: You have a limited number of bardic inspirations per short rest that you can use, and you've used quite a few this battle.
Sam: Oh, that's considered a bardic inspiration, my Cutting Words?
Matt: Yeah, you use one of those dice to reduce the damage. You've inspired at least--
Liam: Me once, Grog once--
Matt: Grog twice now.
Sam: It says, bardic inspiration, no that's not it, is it? 1d10, is that, five?
Taliesin: Five, you have five of those.
Matt: So this would be your last one.
Sam: Okay, I'm using it.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Sam: It's a d10, yeah?
Taliesin: Yeah. Although to be fair, it doesn't matter what you roll.
Matt: It doesn't matter what you roll, you're still.
Sam: Hey, I rolled a six.
Matt: Okay, so one of the attacks, as he's coming for you, he hits you once, and as he rears back for another kick to the side of your head, you shout--
Sam: Don't hit me, I'm a little boy! (laughter)
Matt: Just enough pause for you to duck out of the way. However, he uses that inertia to spin back on Vax for a 27.
Liam: Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: And a 21.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So first one Uncanny Dodge, second one full brunt.
Matt: So Scanlan, you take nine points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Not bad.
Matt: Vex, you take, ah--
Liam: I'm Vax.
Matt: Sorry, Vax. Every now and then.
Liam: Every time.
Matt: 14 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half.
Liam: Seven. Yeah.
Matt: And the other one is nine points.
Liam: Nine points.
Matt: Yep.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: So a total of 16 points of damage. He's going to use a ki point again, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Okay. It's gonna be great. 14.
Matt: 14. Towards the end of his turn, Grog's stun shifts off of him, you feel your muscles tense up and you almost fall to your knees as your whole body seizes, the muscles just lock in place. All righty. Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: I'm gonna take Craven Edge and I'm gonna stab him into the sand. And I'm gonna take out the Firebrand Warhammer instead.
Matt: Okay. So you drop the weapon for free, you pull out the fire hammer and it bursts into flame in your hands as you wield it. As you drop Craven Edge, you hear this voice scream in the back of your head, "You fool! This fight is ours!" As the hammer lights up, you just feel this cold dread run down your spine. I need you to make a will saving throw. A wisdom saving throw.
Travis: Ten?
Matt: Ten? You can't possibly let that blade go away, and you drop the hammer and pick up Craven Edge once more. This is the true weapon of a warrior.
Travis: You're right, it is. (laughter)
Matt: And you are not gonna relinquish it. There is no way you could let go of this blade.
Travis: No way at all. Reckless attack on all three swings.
Matt: Okay. The process of picking it up, we'll say would take away your bonus action. So you get two attacks.
Travis: 14. That sucks. That's better. 27.
Matt: Second one hits.
Travis: Okay. Ow. Six, 11, 19.
Matt: 19, all righty. This time as the hammer falls to the ground the flames go out and Craven Edge streaks again, no, makes his saving throw. As it hits him, he stops for a second, puts his hands together. I need you to make another wisdom saving throw. (dramatic music cue)
Will: Ooh, we're Star Trek fighting.
Travis: 11.
Matt: Your vision goes dark as all the sight around you goes to black and the entire vicinity of this fades except for the Earthbreaker before you, just staring at you in this darkness. Then he steps towards you, one step, second step, and while his mouth doesn't move, you can hear his voice piercing into your head that just says, "Grog. You are stronger than this thing that binds you. Where do you find your strength?"
Travis: In my friends.
Matt: The darkness around you immediately shatters and you can see now your friends off to the side, keeping their weapons ready. The entirety of Groon's posture has dropped, and he just bows before you. (cheering)
Mary: Yes! Yes!
Will: Wow.
Matt: At this point, he takes a moment and closes his eyes, and you can see there's this inner glow in his chest, and a bunch of his wounds heal up in but an instant. And as those wounds leave these scars, he looks across the body. "I will wear these with pride."
Sam: (strained) So will I. (laughter)
Sam: Oh, fuck. Zahra! Did you see how awesome that was? I was really good.
Mary: That was wonder-- you still have a little sand right there.
Matt: At this point, he, Groon's not even looking at you guys, still looking at Grog, he goes, "You need not the strength of Vasselheim to aid you, nor is that strength any we have to give. What you need can be found, recovered, reborn. I can see in your face the path is already lying before you. I know of two. The rest you must find yourself. A gift from Kord himself to this mortal plane, carved from the corpse of the earth primordial titan that fell on this continent in the first war. These Titanstone Knuckles were a symbol of power and leadership for generations here in Vasselheim until the last known keeper was slain 200 years ago, the gauntlets taken. I know not of their whereabouts. The other, leathers adorned by the champion of the Raven Queen. This champion's tomb has since come to ruin, sunken beneath a lake to the west of here known as the Marrowglade Loch. Within that tomb lies the Deathwalker's Ward. Now go. You've found your strength. You know your path. I can help you no further." He turns around, walks back to the center of the sand, and just sits back down in the same pose and position he was in when you entered.
Laura: He's so fucking cool.
Travis: Scanlan. Vax.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Yes.
Travis: Do as I do.
Liam: Yep.
Travis: And I bow.
Liam: (strained noise)
Sam: I bow as well.
Travis: And I walk backwards, still facing him to the edge of the pit, and I hoist Vax up.
Liam: (garbled yell)
Travis: And I throw Scanlan up.
Sam: Oh fuck!
Travis: Climb out.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Keyleth runs over to Vax and just hugs him super fast and gives him a peck on the mouth.
Liam: Gently!
Marisha: And says, that was incredible. That was incredible.
Sam: I look over at Zahra.
Mary: That was pretty good, darling. We'll talk later. It really was. It was very good.
Marisha: Are you okay? Do you need healing?
Liam: I'm okay.
Laura: (whispers) Heal him.
Marisha: I give him another hug and give him a Cure Wounds, level three.
Matt: All right.
Mary: Does it also make you sober?
Matt: No.
Liam: No.
Mary: Potions have nothing to do with clearing alcohol away?
Laura: No.
Matt: There's a difference between the healing and flushing one's system.
Liam: Wait, wait, (vomiting noises) I'm ready.
Laura: We should leave.
Travis: I don't know about you, but I think we got all the answers we needed.
Matt: Make a dexterity save, Keyleth. (laughter)
Taliesin: You've had this coming. You so had this coming.
Marisha: I heal you for 12 points. I heal you 12, and then that's actually not bad. Dexterity save?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: 20 total.
Matt: As you see his cheeks fill with bile and liquid of your previous venture at the bar, you instinctually, as the mighty speed and reaction of an air-based Ashari druid, dodge out of the way as he spatters the stonework on the outside of this--
Marisha: I hold his hair back a little bit. His long black hair.
Matt: Two of the monks immediately rush forward with towels out of seemingly nowhere and start quickly cleaning it up while staring at you very, very angrily.
Laura: Sorry, we'll leave.
Liam: Come on, it was their loincloths, come on.
Travis: Apologies, apologies. We should leave now.
Marisha: I just look at them and I'm like, he got hit in the gut a few times.
Laura: He did, actually.
Marisha: We're like a mile high, the oxygen's thin here, it's tough.
Laura: We should go.
Marisha: All right, we should go.
Liam: And as Keyleth helps me away, I say to Kord, it was an honor, thank you.
Laura: Kord? Groon?
Liam: Whatever his name is. (laughter)
Laura: Or to the god that is--
Matt: Hey, this is a place where I think either would work. All right. As you guys make your way outside of the Trial Forge, we'll go ahead and leave today's venture for now-- (yelling)
Matt: -- we'll return next week, return next week to pick up this next venture and see where you guys go from there. So, well done, guys. And thank you Will and Mary for joining us. (cheering)
Mary: Thank you for having us!
Matt: For a couple episodes, yeah.
Liam: What a fun episode.
Matt: Yeah guys, well done everyone.
Will: Thank you.
Marisha: I saw someone on twitter say that this was like our Cheers episode, and I agree. (laughter)
Marisha: I agree with whoever said that.
Mary: Keyleth!
Will: Vasselheim  where everybody knows your name.
Mary: Actually, it would be Grog. Grog walks in the room, everybody goes Grog!
Laura: Hey, come see us in Portland.
Matt: Yeah, come see us in Portland, we'll be there tomorrow, getting there tomorrow but we'll be there for Saturday and Sunday, come see us, come, y'know, bring your stories, we'd love to meet you.
Laura: Come say hi. It looks like the posters are gone, but there's still some signed ones left if you want.
Matt: This means we'll just have to put more up.
Travis: Come by any time, we have a one-hour panel, we have a one-hour group signing, and we're at tables the rest of the time, so just come find us anytime during the day.
Marisha: And if you can't make it to Portland, our panel will be on on Saturday on Wizard World's twitch.
Matt: Yes, it should be. All right, guys, we'll see you next week. Have a wonderful, wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet? (cheering)

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Hate you, Liam. (laughter)
Travis: That was good! Really nice. Some good flavor on it.
Matt: You'll never know. So anyway! Welcome new folks. People who aren't new folks, welcome back. We have some announcements to get to real fast, then we'll jump into the actual story proper here. But, yeah! So, first and foremost, I wanted to give a big thanks and shout-out to Syrinscape, I mentioned them in last week's game, I put together my gaming playlists on their platform, and I'm going to be trying them out tonight to make sure everything works out cool, but their setup is fantastic and I'm really excited about being able to overlap audio, and things fade in and out. If you haven't checked it out, and you want to really amp up your tabletop gaming, it's phenomenal. But they're not paying for this, I'm really excited about it. So that's that, Syrinscape's awesome. Marisha, you want to talk about Signal Boost?
Marisha: Yeah! The first epil-- episode.
Laura: Epilsode!
Marisha: The first epil, of--
Taliesin: Epilay!
Marisha: Epil, epilay, epilogue. The first episode of Signal Boost went live on Tuesday. Go check it out on GeekandSundry.com. Go watch it, it's good fun. And you should go watch it so we don't get cancelled, and we'll keep making more episodes.
Liam: Is that how it works?
Marisha: Apparently!
Matt: Yeah, it's the weirdest thing.
Marisha: It's crazy.
Laura: They care about that?
Marisha: Yeah. And I talk about Rat Queens, in it, and--
Laura: Yes! I saw! It's so good, Marisha. It's really funny.
Taliesin: It's like ten minutes of your-- you have more minutes than two minutes, spend a couple of minutes.
Marisha: And I tell you about cool things that I like. That I picked out myself. My favorite things. Done.
Matt: Watch it. It's good. All right. Next thing I wanted to announce for you guys, tonight's donations, and all donations for the week, are going to be going, as opposed to 826 overall, are going to go to 826Seattle specifically, to Fearless Ideas, is what it's called there, their section up there, you can go to FearlessIdeas.org. This past week there was a terrible gas explosion in Seattle, you may have seen on the news, and it did a lot of damage to that vicinity, including Fearless Ideas, and they've had to cancel a bunch of their stuff, and they're trying to get things repaired and going. So all of our donations this evening will be going towards them and helping them get that effort taken care of. So think good thoughts and help out if you can. Let's see.
Travis: Love you, Seattle!
Marisha: Love you, Seattle!
Matt: 826. We've, next Friday, in Anaheim, at WonderCon, Friday night, we'll be doing a Critical Role panel, from 7:00 to 8:00pm, in Room 515A.
Laura: Wait, are we supposed to be at that?
Matt: Next Friday. Next Friday. But most of us will be there for that panel. We'll be doing a Q&A, answering questions, talking about the show, for all the folks that are local or coming to that convention in the Anaheim area of southern California. So, look forward to seeing you there, next Friday.
Laura: Yes, that's when we-- I can't say. I'll talk to you guys afterwards.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. We'll go over that. Mystery-- secret, I like it.
Laura: Secret, secret.
Matt: Wanted to give another shout-out to Dwarven Forge again, I mentioned them last week. You got to get a glimpse of some of the map stuff they gave us here at Critical Role to help improve our battle mats and scenarios on occasion. Their new Castle Builder Kickstarter is phenomenal, and if you're looking to do big structures and cool castle-based ramparts and parapets and everything, go check it out, it might be right up your alley.
Travis: So pretty.
Matt: So pretty. It's so pretty. Also, Laura, if you want to announce, we have some new merch up in the store!
Laura: Go check GeekandSundry.com, go to their store, right now, because they're up, and it's so awesome, and I can't wait for you guys to see, we have a Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirt. (cheering)
Laura: And I've been so excited about this shirt coming out, I can't wait to wear it, why aren't we wearing it right now?
Matt: (Gilmore voice) "Don't worry. Trust me, it's a fabulous shirt. Some would even say it's quite glorious."
Travis: Oh my god, oh my god.
Laura: As well as the Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirts, we also have exclusive Critical Role d20 rings, spinny rings. Those are limited, so if you get them, then snag them fast, because they're going to be gone.
Travis: We get one of those before they disappear, right?
Laura: I think they said they were going to set us aside some, they'd better.
Travis: They are. They're bitchin'. You spin it, the 20 is the Critical Role logo.
Laura: Why don't we have them right now?! At intermission, maybe we can grab them at intermission.
Travis: They're sick.
Matt: For those who don't know what those are, the d20 spin rings, or spin rings in general, they're actually two separate moving pieces with ball bearings on the inside, and you have all numbers one through 20 on the actual ring, and you can spin it with your finger, and it acts like a die roll!
Laura: And the d20, when you crit succeed, it's a Critical Role logo. Just putting that out there.
Travis: You can do all your life decisions based off a ring.
Matt: What could possibly go wrong?
Liam: You still can die from them, though, just to be clear.
Taliesin: Roll a one.
Marisha: And we are not held responsible if that happens.
Travis: You go straight to Craven Edge.
Liam: It's appropriately called a "die."
Laura: Whatever.
Matt: Liam!
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: You wanted to--
Liam: Sure, I could talk about a couple of things. Hey, a quick shout-out for our neighbor, Ivan van Norman's Kickstarter, The ABCs of RPGs, has three days left. I backed it immediately, because I like D&D and I have kids, and you put those two things together and good things happen. So that's good, three days left. Also, hey, if you like to put your dice in boxes, I tell you what. Wyrmwood Gaming make beautiful boxes, and if you go over to their site and you use the code critrole.
All: Crit. Role.
Liam: There it is. You get free shipping, they're beautiful, they have all different kinds of woods to put your dice inside. Is there anything else? Oh, yeah! Oh, okay. Yeah, hey, some of us, not all of us, are going to be going up to San Fran later this month to make appearances on GameSpot's show The Lobby for a couple of segments, and then, also then hopping over to hang with the guys at Kinda Funny to play D&D.
Laura: Those guys are stupid.
Matt: Which, a few of us will be running a quick little one-shot game I'll be running with the aid of one of their local gentlemen. And it should be a ridiculously ridiculous time! And it'll be a lot of fun.
Liam: And I'm curious to see, because there's going to be two DMs, in sort of a Batman and Robin-type relationship kind of thing?
Matt: Oh yeah. We got plans. I've co-DM'd before, it can be very interesting. And very chaotic. I'm excited.
Travis: Going to kill everybody.
Matt: Probably.
Laura: This has nothing to do with announcements, but I want to only roll green dice tonight. For Saint Patrick's Day.
Marisha: That's a good idea, I've got a set of green dice. I'll get them out. Sure.
Travis: That's stupid. I have gray-ass dice and a blue one.
Marisha: Got to get them all out.
Matt: This is technically light green, guys, by the way, just so you're aware. Cool. Just making sure we're all cool on that.
Travis: Plus the underwear you're wearing.
Matt: Shh, that's just for you.
Liam: Travis and I are wearing green snake shirts, because (Irish accent) Saint Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland, into Burbank.
Matt: Drove the Slytherin from Ireland. He got rid of them all.
Travis: Yeah. I took the Floo network.
Marisha: And I got this in Ireland, so it counts.
Laura: It kind of counts, Marisha.
Marisha: It counts.
Liam: (Irish accent) It's fucking Irish wool!
Marisha: And this is green.
Travis: Yeah, made from real Irish cats.
Matt: They are the best, aren't they? Last but not least, unless anyone else has any other announcements to make, anything else?
Taliesin: Oh! I got a quick one, Book of Murder came out today, so you can hear me do a very weird accent, it's great. So. Yes. Very weird accent.
Matt: And last, next week, we'll have a special guest joining us for an episode, a new guest, the intrepid Nerdist himself, Chris Hardwick, will be coming in for a game next week. (cheering)
Matt: Oh, I'm excited! We made his character this past Monday, and it should be a lot of fun. He's actually fun to game with. We've played D&D a couple times, and he'll be a good addition to the team for his brief stop by. So next week, come check him out on our show!
Travis: Uh-oh, what does that mean?
Matt: So thanks for coming, Chris. I don't know, it'll be fun.
Taliesin: Cleric, is what it means.
Matt: Hoping every guest is a cleric. Just in case.
Travis: Save us! From ourselves.
Matt: All right, then. Without further ado, unless you guys have anything else, we'll go ahead and hop into a quick synopsis of where we are in Critical Role.
Liam: Shit. Help. Help. Help. Help.
Matt: Sam will be here shortly, guys, don't freak out. He's dealing with children and traffic.
Taliesin: Not at the same time.
Marisha: Damn it, you beat me to it. I was going to say those two aren't mutually exclusive. Children and traffic.
Matt: So. Where we left off. The party of Vox Machina, having to deal with the current terrible danger of the Chroma Conclave, a collection of very dangerous dragons that have torn through the entire Tal'Dorei countryside, have then gone on this quest to collect allies, and find these items called the Vestiges of Divergence, these artifacts of ancient wars that carry great power and seem to be the best way you could prepare yourselves for going up against these terrifyingly powerful entities. In searching for this, you went and made your way to Vasselheim, where you reacquired and reestablished friendships with Zahra and Kashaw, two allies from previous instalments of our wondrous adventure, as well as getting Lady Kima on loan from the Platinum Sanctuary of Bahamut, and you all went to seek the first bit of information you discovered about one of these vestiges, not too far from Vasselheim. The champion of the Raven Queen's armor that had been entombed within this temple that had sunken beneath a lake. After traveling to this lake, finding your way through this subterranean, watery location, you found the location of the tomb, upon which, a series of fish creatures, called kuo-toa, had seemingly been worshiping another denizen of this temple, a rather strange slime-covered beholder, that then surprised the party. The battle hard-fought, you came out victorious, and upon going to retrieve your spoils, a trap was set off in the tomb, dodged by one, survived by a bear, and claimed the life of our beloved Vex'ahlia. After a resurrection ritual attempted by Kashaw, the party helping, they were successful in bringing her soul back from the other side, restoring her to life, and the party then, figuring out what their next step in their journey was, took their new allies, via Keyleth's Teleportation via Plants spell, back to Whitestone, which seems to be building as this defensive bastion, this currently not on the radar of the Conclave location that needs defenses, and a good place to keep your allies at the time. And that was where we left off, as you guys had just stepped back into Whitestone.
Laura: We haven't actually slept yet, then.
Matt: Nope!
Laura: It's late.
Marisha: What time is it here?
Matt: I'd say through the evening's travels-- Well, you guys slept all night the night before you went to the temple, the temple's probably been--
Marisha: That's true, we did sleep, actually, we camped out.
Laura: We did?
Marisha: Remember? You talked to Zahra, and I talked to Kash? Then we slept.
Matt: Yeah, you guys did camp out.
Laura: Oh. I didn't know if we camped, I thought we talked.
Matt: You talked.
Marisha: We at least chilled. I don't know.
Matt: Regardless. You found your way to Whitestone. We'll say for the sake of the current setting, you've come in in a rather overcast mid-afternoon in Whitestone, you may have spent some time there gathering yourselves as your allies scope out their new surroundings, the people of Whitestone accepting you as you arrive, you can always see people walking by and catching a glance at the group of heroes known as Vox Machina that helped liberate them from the oppressive Briarwoods not long ago.
Taliesin: Keep crawling out of trees.
Marisha: It's always weird. Not crawling out of trees, that people like us.
Travis: Should we inspect our spoils?
Taliesin: I was going to say, we should take the armor and the necklace to the castle and have it inspected.
Laura: Is Lady Allura here?
Matt: Kima, who is with you, is like, "Is she?"
Laura: No. Well, she was on her way to Westruun, and we haven't heard from her yet.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: "Haven't heard from her since-- You say Westruun was under attack as well?"
Laura: Yes, but she knew it. She was going in secret.
Matt: "That prideful woman." She slings her hammer off her shoulder and slams it to the ground and says, "Well. If she doesn't arrive in the next few hours, I'm going to gather a party and we're going to go to Westruun and find her."
Travis: Yeah!
Marisha: Kima-- Wait, what? Why?
Laura: Wait, there's a dragon there, Kima, a very large one, and she was being very, very stealthy--
Matt: Her hammer slams into her metallic armor, and she goes, "I've a much bigger dragon backing me up." And she looks up to the sky for a second and grins.
Travis: Lady Kima don't give a fuck.
Laura: We'll wait, Kima.
Matt: (frustrated sigh)
Laura: Going in loud will only cause more trouble.
Matt: "I'll wait a few days."
Laura: She should be here by then.
Marisha: I can always attempt to scry, and see if I can check in on her.
Matt: "Okay. Not a bad idea."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "Okay. I need a drink."
Marisha: Let's get somewhere safe.
Matt: She charges off, looking for the nearest tavern.
Marisha: Here, I guess. I don't know. I forget it's not overrun by vampires, I'm sorry. Sorry, I forgot; it's all right now.
Laura: Maybe somewhere safe, like right here--
Marisha: Like right here, sorry, there's a lot going on.
Matt: Zahra and Kashaw looking around expectantly as you continue this conversation. Kash crosses his arms, goes, "Great place. There's a lot of white." Of which Zahra comes and steps over and is like, "Don't worry, darling. (laughter) So, sleeping arrangements, I hope?"
Laura: Yes, the castle.
Taliesin: We'll be putting you up in the castle.
Matt: "That's what I like to hear. All right. To the castle, Kash?" "Sure. It's better than, well, it's better than anything. Let's go for the castle." And they both make their way towards Whitestone Castle, to find a comfortable place to get themselves situated in their new surroundings.
Laura: So we're healed up, we are healed, we are not running the risk of dying at any moment, because we've been healed.
Matt: What is that? What is that blur of green?
Travis: It's a fucking leprechaun, get it!
Sam: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Liam: You should be.
Marisha: Your shirt, is that new? Because I love it so much.
Sam: Thanks! But I'm also wearing a tie because it's a special night.
Laura: Right. It's a special occasion.
Sam: (sighs) So, is Allura dead? (laughter)
Travis: Kima just left, so--
Laura: She's on her way to a tavern. Kima's drinking it up. Grog! Kima's drinking it up.
Marisha: Are we heading to a tavern?
Taliesin: We're heading to the castle. We're going to talk to friends, we're going to take a look at--
Travis: Corpse armor, hello.
Marisha: Oh, corpse armor.
Travis: Yeah. You know, the thing that almost killed our friend over here?
Laura: It did kill me. According to you.
Taliesin: It-- yes.
Travis: Yeah, but, I mean, you're here, so you didn't die. But you did. But you didn't. But you did. And then you didn't.
Laura: Thanks, Grog.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: All right, so. You guys all heading to the castle?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: You head to the castle. Cassandra isn't there at the moment, but Keeper Yennen is currently there with a few other members of the makeshift council you guys put together towards the end. One of the heads of the entire farming establishment here in Whitestone is with them, and they're having a conversation. As Zahra and Kashaw burst in first, he's like, "I'm sorry, we're not currently taking visitors, could you-- Oh. Friends of yours, I presume?"
Taliesin: Good friends.
Laura: Helpers, actually. They're going to be here for a while. Hopefully.
Matt: "Gracious. Oh, I see you yourself carry the vestments of a man of the cloth. Who brings your power this day?" Kashaw gives him a look and goes, "You don't even want to know, buddy." Walks past him.
Taliesin: That was a really good Kashaw.
Matt: "Very well! I assume they're staying here as well."
Taliesin: Yes. We appreciate it greatly.
Matt: "They'll be taken care of, Percival."
Taliesin: They will be well worth your time. We also have something that needs a bit of study. We found something. We found two objects of power that we think may help us turn the table against the dragons.
Laura: Two objects?
Matt: "This is good news."
Taliesin: Two objects.
Laura: What was the second?
Taliesin: There was a necklace.
Laura: There was?
Taliesin: There was.
Sam: You were dead.
Laura: Oh. I must have missed it because I was dead. That's right.
Matt: "Dead?!"
Taliesin: It's been a very long day.
Sam: Mostly dead.
Marisha: Be very careful when handling this armor, is what we're trying to say.
Travis: Or don't handle it, and we'll take care of it.
Matt: "So, the armor is what killed you?"
Laura: No, actually, a trap that Percival set off is what killed me.
Taliesin: Yes, the--
Liam: What?
Taliesin: -- trap was a bit-- it was a bit, ah-- there was a trap. And it was well-protected.
Liam: What?
Laura: What, what, what? What?
Taliesin: Yes, what.
Laura: What?
Travis: (mutters) He didn't know that.
Laura: What? So these Vestiges.
Matt: "Vestiges."
Laura: These leathers, these things.
Matt: "Um--" And he puts a couple of small, armored, like, studded-leather gloves on and has to carefully reach out for the vestments as you hand them. And he grabs them. "Give me a bit of time with them, perhaps, I need to clarify what this enchantment may be. Do you mind staying around, just in case?"
Taliesin: Not at all.
Matt: "Don't feel strange that I don't trust this, but, based on your history with it, I would like a little backup." So, he carries you off down the far hallway, you didn't get this far into Whitestone when you initially came through, but towards the back there was a small study area converted into a research establishment largely set up for the ziggurat beneath the city. He clears off an area of the table and sets this down. And he takes some time working with the vestments before he eventually, and it's this awkward quiet of hearing him mutter to himself and bring out a symbol and bring over a minor enchantment to reveal information, that tearing into the divinity, the divine magic that is granted to him, before he says, "This carries the mark of the Raven Queen, a very strong mark. I've not seen power like this in but an object."
Laura: It was worn by one of her champions. The great Purvan.
Matt: "That's a strange name."
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "Regardless, it appears that this armor does help fortify one's defenses from any sort of physical damage, as well as give you a chance of surviving even the most dangerous of near-death experiences. It also grants a fluid resistance to the elements. Here." And he hands it over, and-- who would like to take this? Item card to--
Travis: Well, you died for it, you--
Laura: I think I like it, but I'll just look at it.
Marisha: It's leather?
Laura: It's leather.
Matt: So, to give you the specifics on it, it's plus two to AC. Magical on top of the studded leather armor. Plus two enchantment, beyond just the studded leather armor. It does give you advantage on death saving throws.
Sam: You'll need that.
Matt: As it is called the Deathwalker's Ward, and once per short rest, you can set it to be resistant to one of the five types of damage.
Laura: You choose which one.
Matt: You choose. You can change it. You can leave it all on one, but if you want to change it during a short rest, you can shift it from fire or cold, or lightning--
Travis: Acid, or necrotic.
Sam: You're, like, indestructible now!
Marisha: Do you have fancy leather armor right now? What does your armor do right now? Anything?
Liam: It's acid-resistant.
Laura: My armor's acid-resistant, I sort of stole it from my brother. Do you want your acid-resistant armor back, then?
Liam: Whatever you want, Vex'ahlia.
Laura: He's in such a sour mood lately.
Travis: Well, yeah. Well, what about the necklace?
Matt: "The necklace as well?"
Taliesin: I hand it over.
Matt: He takes it, and he goes, "Well, the chain on this necklace is not actually part of the enchantment, it's merely to hold the crystal itself. The crystal is the item of particular interest here, this-- oh, wait a minute." He takes it and he scans over the table and pulls up a jeweler's eyepiece and inspects it closely. "There's something inside this gem."
Travis: Uh-oh.
Marisha: (groans) Not again.
Laura: What is it?
Marisha: Why do things like living in gems? It can't be comfortable.
Travis: It might be a worm.
Laura: It's like tequila.
Matt: "I can't actually ascertain the nature of whatever being is encased within this, but--"
Laura: There's a being, it's a being?
Marisha: Encased.
Laura: Is it a soul gem?
Marisha: Like something put it in there.
Matt: He takes a moment and concentrates on his holy symbol of Pelor, and you can see as he puts aside the eyepiece, his eyes glaze over with a grayish, frosted white color, at which point he inspects the gem very closely, and there's this slight vibration in the air around him. As soon as it fades about a minute later, he pulls back and goes, "This is referred to as the Raven's Slumber. It's actually a small gateway to a tiny pocket-plane."
Sam: A pocket-plane?
Marisha: Ooh.
Matt: "It can contain one creature. You have to contact whatever it was, and it can't be too big, but it can essentially contain something indefinitely within this."
Laura: But something's already in there?
Matt: "Something is already in this."
Travis: Awesome.
Sam: Something that we can summon?
Marisha: Any way we can find out what it possibly is before we summon it?
Matt: "Unfortunately, I do not have that capability."
Laura: It was buried with--
Sam: I'll take that.
Laura: Oh, that's really smart to give to Scanlan.
Travis: Well, like, you said "not too big" though, right?
Matt: "The confines of the space, at least, as part of the enchantment, seem rather small. A bit larger than you, maybe, but not much more than that."
Travis: Right, right, okay.
Matt: "Here."
Travis: Please.
Marisha: Well, does it change size?
Laura: This is maybe the worst thing that Scanlan's ever held outside of that gun that you had, Percy.
Travis: What are you talking about? Can we take it in the woods, open it up, and if it sucks we kill it, and if not, we've got a new pet.
Marisha: We don't even know how to open it up! Do we know how to open it up?
Travis: Oh, we will find a way.
Laura: It was buried with the Raven Queen's champion, I mean, it could be incredibly dangerous. Or it could be incredibly good, and he trapped it, and they're bad, right?
Liam: The same could be said about your new pajamas.
Laura: They are so beautiful. I do like feathers.
Travis: What do they smell like?
Laura: (sniffs) Like (sniffs) must and mold. And birds, really.
Travis: (laughing) And birds? Eesh.
Matt: "So, is that all you require of me?"
Travis: I require Percy to tell us what the fuck's up with the necklace he's reading about.
Taliesin: Just what he said.
Laura: Yeah, he already told us about it.
Sam: Once we release whatever is inside of it, we can use this necklace as a weapon, to--
Taliesin: It's a cage.
Sam: To trap people.
Marisha: Hang on, okay. Let's think about this. What do we remember from the great Purvan's story?
Laura: Well, let me look at my book?
Marisha: What did he fight?
Sam: I just remember that Purvan's story touched me. Touched me in inappropriate ways.
Travis: (laughing) No, no, no.
Laura: You know what I like about this particular piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so it's extra special instead of the regular paper.
Matt: It's legendary.
Taliesin: Legendary cardstock.
Marisha: Can we get purple cardstock up in here?
Laura: I'm talking to Matt, bitches. Okay. I forgot what I was going to say-- Oh, my book! My 30-gold book! Does it say anything about what Purvan fought?
Matt: All right! You read through. There were many, many things throughout the war that were fought: entities from the Nine Hells, there was a faction of the Abyss that came in as a third bit of evil in this whole conflict; and while not in alliance against the other forces of chaos, there were many forces of chaos lashing out at what was nearby. So the Champion's-- there was no specific entity that was his chosen, or at least, what you can ascertain to be a specific being of hatred, although it does speak of Purvan, the Champion of the Raven Queen, keeping with him an ally.
Laura: Like Trinket.
Matt: It doesn't say the nature of the ally, it just says the dangerous and respected Galdric.
Laura: (gasps) Galdric.
Taliesin: Well, there are some options here.
Laura: What?
Taliesin: No, that won't work, damn it.
Travis: Well, say it, come on.
Taliesin: Well, I was thinking we could find a safe place, surround it, let it out, and if it's dangerous, take care of it. We could even take it down into the pits beneath the castle so that if it's a magical creature, it would be harmless. Except I don't know if we could actually release it down there. I don't know--
Laura: Yeah, what if it touches the thing, and it--
Sam: There's also magic resistance down there.
Taliesin: Yeah, which means it wouldn't work in the first place.
Marisha: What if he's friendly? I mean, he talks about being an ally.
Taliesin: It might be an ally.
Marisha: Well then, wouldn't we want to save it?
Laura: An ally of Purvan! An ally of Purvan's!
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Is Purvan a good guy?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: I thought the Raven Queen was not good!
Taliesin: No, the Raven Queen--
Marisha: She's like-- neutral.
Taliesin: Can I make a roll for this?
Matt: Make a religion check.
Taliesin: Okay, thank you. Nope, nope, it's St. Patty's Day.
Travis: Don't kill anybody.
Laura: Yeah, with these green dice.
Taliesin: Religion or history?
Matt: Religion.
Travis: Religion.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: 11. The general essence of the Raven Queen she is both loved and feared in equal parts. She does not lord over the afterlife, the underworld, whatever you may call it-- she lords over the moment and the transition of death, which is largely considered neither a good nor evil, just a natural force. It could be accepted either way. Many men fear it, and fear her for that reason, and there are those that instead embrace it as the inevitable. As to the true nature of her intent, no one really knows. It's part of her mystique.
Travis: So, like, even if we let out the glorious Ball-lick or whatever his name is, like, if he's bad, we can't really put him back in, right?
Taliesin: No, we actually can. Actually, we can put him back in.
Travis: What, we touch him with it and he goes back in?
Sam: Correct.
Matt: After a saving throw.
Marisha: Maybe we should save him and release him when he'll be valuable to us?
Taliesin: So would a trap. We could also trap other creatures--
Laura: It's like a Poké Ball! Right? It's like a Pokémon?
Taliesin: Yes, it's exactly like a Poké Ball.
Marisha: Who knows if he'll go back in willingly?
Taliesin: You don't have to go in willingly, that's sort of the point.
Matt: I guess you could technically use it that way, yeah.
Marisha: But wouldn't we rather be friendly with him than him be angry at us the next time we release him?
Taliesin: I'm more excited about the idea of carrying around an empty trap.
Marisha: But we could win both. But we could have a trap and a friend.
Liam: I think Percy is right that we should let it out now because it's a question mark, no matter what. Whatever, it's all theories. We don't know what we're getting into, and better that it pop out now, on its own, and not while we're facing a fucking beholder.
Laura: I think we should do it in the forest outside of Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Or the forest outside of Whitestone.
Sam: Vasselheim? We're here.
Marisha: Why don't we try and do a little bit more research on Galdric first?
Sam: That would be too careful.
Travis: Yeah, come on. Come on.
Sam: Vex! Just open it!
Liam: Percival. Are there any libraries here?
Taliesin: Not really, anymore.
Liam: What about a personal collection in your family?
Taliesin: Didn't they ravage most of our collection?
Matt: Elements have been ravaged. Elements of family history have been destroyed so that there couldn't be large connections, or the end of the bloodline itself being too prominently displayed within the castle itself. There is still a library there, though from your knowledge-- and you've read through most of those books growing up-- a lot of them are loose history books; a lot of them are more encyclopedia-like, general knowledge--
Taliesin: She wasn't a revered deity in this part of the world, we don't have a lot--
Laura: All right, yeah, let's do it. Woods!
Travis: Woods! Woods! Woods!
Taliesin: Woods, or Vasselheim, that's actually not a bad idea to get far away from Whitestone.
Travis: No, because then somebody else'll come along and kill it.
Sam: Plus they don't like magic.
Taliesin: This is sort of our secret, and we should perhaps keep this--
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Well, we were going to go take a look at--
Marisha: (muffled) What if--
Travis: You got shit in your mouth.
Marisha: We g-- mm, sorry. Little bit of saliva.
Liam: Goodberries?
Marisha: Snacks. We go to those goliath caves, right outside of Whitestone, that were abandoned.
Travis: Stone giant caves?
Marisha: Those!
Travis: Shit. Made me feel like I had to poop for a second, there. Goliath caves, fuck.
Marisha: Sorry! I just remembered you recognized them. They were empty, and abandoned, we could go there.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Is that close to your family?
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: No, we saw it on the way into Whitestone.
Taliesin: It's just a couple hours away, correct?
Laura: Oh.
Matt: It's, I'd say roughly three, three and a half hours northwest of here.
Laura: Let's do it!
Matt: Yeah, it's where the forest of the Alabaster Sierras ends and the actual Alabaster Sierra mountain range begins, is where that transitions.
Taliesin: We can take a day and do this.
Laura: All right, sure. Let's do it. All right. What do you think? Good idea? Good idea?
Liam: Sure, yes, yes, yes, Keyleth had a good idea, yes.
Matt: All right. So.
Laura: We're healed, yes?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: We're healed, right? Did we sleep? Do we need to sleep?
Liam: I thought we rested before we went down under the water, though--
Laura: No, we did, we didn't rest since then.
Liam: I don't remember resting afterwards. And I was there.
Travis: I don't either. I remember I peed on a lake, and then we went under it.
Matt: Yeah, I think you guys decided instead of resting to come to rest here in Whitestone.
Laura: Yeah, we need to sleep, y'all!
Taliesin: Let's take a sleep, and we'll do it in the morning.
Travis: What time is it, about?
Matt: I'd say by now, with as much time as you spent in the temple, from waking up in the morning, it's getting four in the afternoon, five in the afternoon. The sun's starting to come down, so.
Laura: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.
Sam: Aren't we going to sleep?
Laura: But it's four in the afternoon! There's other things to do today.
Marisha: Like drink?
Laura: Like find out how Gilmore's doing and see Pike.
Marisha: And I should probably scry and check in on Allura, right?
Taliesin: I've got some work to do.
Matt: It's up to you guys. Yeah, and you're starting to push towards the bottom of your ammunition stack anyway, Percy.
Taliesin: I need to, yeah, to do a little-- and I've got a little thing I want to work on.
Matt: Cool. All right, so, who's doing what first?
Taliesin: I'm going to take Vax aside very quickly.
Travis: Let's do that first!
Taliesin: I had a careless moment, and I apologize. And you're the first apology I'm putting forward. I don't know if I would have done anything different, but I hope you know that I would've never forgiven myself.
Liam: What're you talking about?
Taliesin: I rushed in and triggered the trap that almost killed your sister.
Liam: That killed my sister.
Taliesin: I can't say that.
Liam: What do you mean?
Taliesin: I was careless.
Liam: Well, what happened, Percival?
Taliesin: I felt the danger had passed, and I moved too quickly, and opened the casket without thinking. That's all. I just didn't think.
Liam: You just opened it? Just like that?
Taliesin: I was tired, wasn't thinking. Sometimes we move too quickly. But I want you to know that it would've-- I'm very glad that she's alive, because I don't think I could have lived with myself.
Liam: All right. Could you do me a favor?
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: In the future-- If there is anything that your little heart desires inside of a box-- In the future, could you check with my sister or myself first?
Taliesin: That's the hope, yes. That was more of a lesson than I was hoping for. Thankfully not too much of one.
Liam: Well--
Taliesin: And none of us are beyond mistakes, but... that is a mistake that I am going to be thinking about for a very long time. We are going into dangerous territory, and we all have to think a little bit more. And she especially, I-- I couldn't--
Liam: Well listen, Percy. We are not playing a game.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: And we will all make mistakes, and I wager I will make my fair share. I've little doubt. And Percival, I want to apologize. I'm sorry. But-- And I punch him in his know-it-all fucking mouth.
Matt: Do you attempt to move out of the way, or take it?
Taliesin: Yeah, let's take it.
Matt: All right. (impact sound) Decks you square in the-- for as hefty as a punch it was? Doesn't hurt quite as much as you expected. But it's not the physical pain that hurts, more than the action and the knowledge that there are more repercussions to your rash decision than even you initially anticipated.
Liam: Goodnight, Percival.
Taliesin: Goodnight, Vax.
Sam: It's four in the afternoon! (laughter)
Taliesin: I'm going to work. I'm going into my studio.
Matt: All right, who else wants to do something?
Marisha: Where'd Kima go?
Matt: Kima is actually-- she's begun day-drinking into the night! So yeah, she's currently by herself in one of the few functional taverns in Whitestone. It's fairly empty at the moment, especially at this hour as the sun slowly sets. She's not heavy drinking but she's definitely nursing a tankard and quietly contemplating as she sits at the edge of the bar with her hands around the tankard. She's staring at her reflection as she spins it slowly on the wood. You can hear it (scuffing) on the woodgrain.
Marisha: Anyone else want to go to the--
Laura: I'm going with you, yeah.
Matt: There's like a few other random patrons, but no one catches your eye. No one specifically.
Sam: I'll come, too. Well, actually, wait. Grog, what're you doing?
Travis: Nothing yet.
Sam: I'm with Grog.
Matt: Okay. So the two of you, into the tavern-- she doesn't notice you guys.
Marisha: I go up and put my hand on her shoulder.
Matt: "Keyleth!"
Marisha: Hey! How's it going?
Matt: "Better."
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: I lean up against the bar, next to you guys.
Marisha: Want to check in on Allura?
Matt: "Let's do it."
Marisha: Is there an empty room around here?
Matt: She looks over to the barkeep. You all stare over and the barkeep is currently there like wiping down the bar section. "For how long?"
Laura: For a couple hours.
Marisha: Doesn't need to be that long.
Matt: "Two silver?"
Laura: We saved your life? And the entire town.
Matt: "You are fine to use it as you please for the remainder of the afternoon. Just don't mess it up, please."
Marisha: Sure. We'll try really hard to find better things to do with our time. Okay.
Matt: All right, you make your way up and the place is fairly vacant, there are a couple of rooms that are currently partially-- the doors are ajar and you hear voices in there, and you recognize it's a couple of the refugees that you guys brought over from your keep, currently holed up in this tavern. An inn floor on the second floor. But there are a number of open rooms right now that you could go ahead and step into for use.
Marisha: Just pick one.
Matt: Okay. So. Do you want to go ahead and attempt a Scry ritual?
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: Focusing on...?
Marisha: The flower that I gave her before we left.
Laura: Ooh, good call.
Matt: All right, so. As you all sit down, Kima sitting across from you, arms closed. She looks at you intensely with this really direct glare, waiting for some sort of sign of an answer or information. As you complete the ritual preparation of the scrying, your vision transcends your form, jettisoned through the ceiling and into the clouds. Clouds rush past, you can feel the wind pushing across your face, your hair, and as the clouds part you see, below, you see Westruun. And from Westruun you can see most of the city, as you recall, and a large portion of it currently looks toppled-over and pushed into ruin. There are no longer burning black clouds, but white smoke, long after a fire or some sort of an impact, lazily drifting off some of those ruins. It focuses even closer, and you see very little populace in the streets. Most everyone's either indoors or not visible at the moment. Your vision clicks in once again, and you can see currently some sort of dark room hidden in Westruun. You see, for a brief instant, a flicker of light, and you see Drake Thunderbrand and Allura both gathering a few small books under their arms, silently waiting, quietly. You hear (impact sounds) some heavy footfalls above. They both just stay quiet, stay quiet. Allura stays still for a moment. She looks over at Drake. They both take hands and then (whoosh) convert into that same energy form you saw that jettisoned out of Greyskull Keep, that echoes down a long hallway that you previously didn't see was attached to this room. It leads to a stone spiral staircase that goes upward before these two dual sparks travel through the small crack between where the edge of a trap door and a wooden floor is as the sparks course upward into the now-setting sun. You can see amongst the sparks the mostly collapsed rubble of the Cobalt Reserve, the large library in the center of Westruun. You can see dozens of corpses that have been largely dissolved. You can see what remnants of their bodies have been eaten away by some sort of caustic material, their arms and fingers tightened up as the muscles pull into this horrible, gnarled visage of what once were the living residents of Westruun. You do see, as the spark comes to a stop for a second in its movement, and you hear briefly overhead (wingbeats) and you see rush overhead, wings fully spread, the black dragon that you had briefly encountered in Emon streak upward, roaring loudly, towards Gatshadow, the tall, dark spire mountain just north of Westruun. (whoosh) And as it heads up there, the sparks (electric sound) continue their trek through the streets, and at that point the ritual fades, its vision unable to maintain its focus. Your vision is pulled back up into the clouds and then thrust back into your current position and with a shock you find yourself back in the tavern.
Laura: What did you see? Is she all right?
Marisha: She's alive, her and Drake both are alive.
Matt: "Good. Where are they going?"
Marisha: They're at the Cobalt Reserve, which is in ruins, as well as the rest of Westruun.
Laura: Did you see the dragon?
Marisha: Yes, the black dragon is there. Looks like he's taken up residence in the black spire-- tower. What was it called?
Laura: Gatshadow?
Marisha: That one.
Marisha: Gatshadow. Allura--
Laura: Could you communicate with her when you scry? I don't know how it works.
Marisha: No, I can just look in and see.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: She was grabbing the last few important tomes, remnants left from the Cobalt Library, I mean, Reserve.
Matt: "They staying in Westruun?"
Marisha: It didn't look like it.
Matt: "Where are they going?"
Marisha: I don't know, I didn't see.
Matt: "Did you talk about where you--"
Laura: We left word. And told her we were coming here.
Matt: "Here to Whitestone?"
Laura: Yes. If you wait, she'll be here.
Matt: "Who else is coming?"
Laura: Drake.
Matt: "Drake. Anybody else on the Council coming?"
Sam: We brought some Council members, right? Were any among our--
Matt: You're not there, you're with Grog.
Sam: Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, oh, I'm not there! (laughter)
Sam: So, Grog! Want to play some bocce ball? (laughter)
Marisha: I don't know who all's coming.
Laura: Uriel.
Matt: "Dead? Well, that's great. That's fantastic. What about the rest?"
Marisha: His wife and children are here.
Matt: "Here, okay."
Marisha: As well as Gilmore.
Laura: Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Matt: "Right, right."
Laura: Wonderful place to buy all sorts of products, if it were still... standing.
Matt: "Huh. I've only heard things, I've not met this 'Gilmore'."
Marisha: You haven't met Gilmore!? Man, I just assume everyone knows each other.
Matt: "Anybody else? Tofor?"
Laura: Yes, maybe...? Yes, Tofor...?
Marisha: He might have... been... slain...?
Laura: Which one is Tofor?
Marisha: She's the dragonborn--
Laura: Yes, Tofor-- they did, I think Tofor is-- definitely maybe here.
Matt: Last you heard, two Council members that were confirmed still alive by Gilmore when you found him-- or, confirmed by Uriel's wife and family-- thank you, sorry, were Tofor and Asum.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: So both were two of the ones that were saved by Gilmore, and then once he was too wounded to continue, they left to seek for survivors in Emon. That was the last you heard of them.
Laura: Oh. They're not actually here, then. Yes. They're looking for other survivors, Tofor and Asum.
Matt: "In the place where this-- and what's this dragon you keep talking about?"
Laura: Oh, shit, you don't know anything. Thordak! Big. Terrible. Red.
Matt: As you say the name again, you can see her eyes resonate with a clarity, and where once was this very intense expression and air of demanding information suddenly recedes into this look of sudden fear, and she's briefly lost in thought.
Laura: Yes, you defeated him once. He escaped the Fire Realm.
Marisha: Not only did he escape, he tore a giant tear in the rifts between the Fire Realm and ours.
Matt: (sighs deeply) "Thordak." And you can see, she's starting to hyperventilate suddenly, like, for all of her strong exterior, this is the first time, aside from the brief hit of the beholder's ray earlier, you see fear in her eyes, and she starts standing up. (pants) "I need to get some air."
Marisha: Kima, Kima, it'll be--
Matt: "I need to--"
Marisha: Sit here, you want to sit down?
Matt: "I need to get s-- I need to get some air." And she storms out of the room.
Marisha: Let's go outside.
Laura: Actually, Keyleth--
Marisha: What?
Laura: I shut the door behind Kima.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: I want to talk to you.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: I would ask my brother, but, knowing him, he would walk away. What happened?
Marisha: Keyleth has a hard time looking her in the eye.
Laura: Look at me, Keyleth! Be strong! You're royalty. Tell me what happened.
Marisha: Vex, I don't want to ever see you like that again. I don't want to ever see anybody like that again.
Laura: I grab both sides of her face and force her to look at me. I'm all right. I'm still here. Okay? I need you to tell me what happened. Because between us? Vax is off. Something's wrong. And I need to know what it is.
Marisha: We all watched you die.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: It's like--
Laura: How did I get back? Who brought me back? Kashaw, Zahra, my brother. Anyone else?
Marisha: I guess... you could say, probably an unseen entity, an unseen force. Oh, I'm lightheaded.
Laura: Sit down.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: There's a bed. Sit down.
Marisha: Percy--
Laura: Percy helped.
Marisha: Let's skip that. When we brought you back, Kashaw performed a resurrection ritual.
Laura: Like we did with Pike.
Marisha: Yes. And he called upon a deity and at first he was afraid that it was Vesh. Which he was quite terrified about.
Laura: His wife.
Marisha: Yes. That, I don't believe, is the presence that answered his call.
Laura: Okay. Fluttery words here, darling. Get to the point.
Marisha: I thought I was going to lose you both. I thought I was going to lose you and Vax.
Laura: Why Vax? Did he get hurt as well? No. What did he do?
Marisha: He-- I don't know. I don't know what he did. He said to take him instead, is what he told the entity. He offered his life for yours. And my biggest fear was that neither of you were going to come back. He offered his life for you. And for all we know, that offer was accepted.
Laura: Right.
Marisha: If I had to guess, it was probably the Raven Queen herself.
Laura: Well. It's rather suiting, isn't it?
Marisha: He seems to do that quite a lot.
Laura: Yes. Keyleth? Thank you, dear. And I leave.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I stay behind and burst into tears.
Matt: Okay. Grog and Scanlan! What're you guys doing? (relieved laughter)
Liam: (Grog voice) Go fish.
Travis: So-- what do you want to do?
Sam: I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it. Do you have any games with you?
Travis: No.
Sam: Anything in the Bag of Holding?
Travis: I think there's some orc parts in there that've been in for a couple months.
Sam: Doesn't sound very fun.
Travis: Right. I got all nervous when they mentioned a goliath's cave, so I need to go boom-boom.
Sam: Should I play a song so no one can hear it?
Travis: Might help. Like, stand guard outside the door.
Sam: Yeah, yeah. A little muzak.
Travis: Would you mind?
Sam: It's what I'm here for.
Travis: Can I go drop some ordnance?
Matt: And as you find one of the few local ramshackle outhouses-- none are quite goliath-sized, and it's an uncomfortable experience, but thank God you brought a bard along or you would have woken up half the populace just going to bed, as Scanlan, I--
Sam: Nothing to see here, everybody! (plays random chords on the harmonica) Nothing to see here!
Travis: (coughs, then farts) Oh!
Laura: Okay, okay, okay, okay. (laughter)
Travis: Now, the music's playing, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: It's just a stall, just me?
Matt: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: All right, can I take out Craven Edge?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: All right.
Marisha: In the outhouse? Sorry, keep going!
Travis: It's the palace, this is where all the best thoughts and conversations happen! I don't know how it is at your house.
Liam: Keep in mind how confined it is, okay?
Travis: Yeah!
Liam: And go. (laughter)
Matt: Yes. (grunting)
Sam: Sounds like a rough one in there, buddy!
Matt: As you (chuckles) as you see one of the wood boards splinter out the side for a second--
Sam: Ah, yup, that's tacos!
Travis: You might want to play a bit louder and maybe take a few steps away, it's about to get violent.
Sam: No problem!
Travis: Yep.
Matt: At that moment you focus, and as you can feel the blade itself grow cold in your fingertips, you can see what little bit of light that filters through the bright orangish-red color that's coming from the sunset, you can see a reflection in the obsidian blade as a voice comes to your ear and says, "You fed me well."
Travis: Yeah, I did, right? I mean, we are really doing well. Question: so, when we were fighting that big Earthbreaker Groot-looking guy, he called you a 'dark weapon'. Does that-- do you have feelings, and did that hurt them?
Matt: There's a brief pause before you hear this long, drawn-out, (heavy sigh).
Travis: Right, hold on! No, no, listen. And I take my thumb and I run it against the blade real quick.
Matt: Okay. As you do, all of a sudden the voice goes, (gasp, contented exhale).
Travis: Right, yep, sorry, listen. So, my question is, as much as I love opening up people to feed you, I want to know, like-- what's in it for you?
Sam: Grog, are you talking to your shit?
Travis: Yeah, no, you got to let it know who's boss!
Sam: Okay.
Matt: The voice creeps in again, this time. "There is no feeling more terrifying than hunger. And I hunger forever. You help satiate that hunger. That is our arrangement. I give you the strength of those you cut down, and I feed upon them. If this is unsatisfactory, I can and have found others who are more willing to be part of this arrangement--"
Travis: No, no, no, I'm a big fan, really, I mean, I am yoked out when I'm using you, it's fucking amazing. I mean, people are flying apart, it's like a dream. But listen, can you ever be... full?
Matt: "I have never been full before. Perhaps you're the one to find out."
Travis: I'll bet I am, actually, you're really lucky you found me and not these other blokes, not even half the man I am. But listen, so, there's no, like, endgame, just to be clear, you just want to drink and drink, 'cause I've seen the blood, right? And usually I wipe it off, but you, like, suck it in, and that's a little unsettling, not going to lie.
Matt: "My hunger grows, but the air tarnishes my blade. Perhaps we can continue this conversation elsewhere."
Travis: (farts) Right, yeah, right. Not even a problem. Well, look, I like the way you cut people open, so we'll continue this another time. And I sheathe him.
Matt: All right. As you sheathe, the last thing he says is, "Don't forget: I hunger always."
Travis: I kick the door open, and I'm like, if you're within 200 feet, back up!
Sam: No one's out here, Grog.
Travis: Oh.
Sam: Just me. Are you all right?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I heard you say something about blood.
Travis: Yeah, no, am I sweating? It was a real workout, that one.
Sam: At some point you said, "Are you full?" Are you talking about-- did you fill it all the way up?
Travis: Yeah, the privy, you know, it was starting to give my bum a tickle.
Sam: Wow!
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: You topped it off!
Travis: Yeah. Because, you know, you don't want to, like, dip in the muck, it's, you know--
Laura: Foul.
Sam: Not at all.
Travis: Did you want to--
Sam: I think I'm good.
Travis: Are you sure? I warmed it up for you, it's, like, ready to go.
Sam: I love a good deuce, but not today, I think.
Travis: All right. Fair enough. But I'm feeling so, like, vacated--
Sam: We should go get a bite.
Travis: I think you're right!
Sam: (laughs) All right, let's go.
Travis: (laughing) Okay.
Matt: Okay. You guys are getting a bite. Percival, if you want to go ahead and make a tinkering check with dexterity modifier to create more ammunition.
Taliesin: Tinkering check with dexterity modifier?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Should be plus 11.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. We'll say, in the time that you've had here, with the materials you purchased, and Whitestone's pretty open to supplying you--
Taliesin: I've got a thing.
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you're able to create roughly 40 or so simple bullets in the time that you have.
Taliesin: Do I have time to poke at a modification to the explosive arrow? I want to try and build a rock breaker. I'm curious to try and build an arrow for taking down walls or taking down doors.
Matt: Like a siege arrow?
Taliesin: A light form of siege arrow. Basically, I want to have a tip that actually manages to breach stone and then an explosion that goes outwards, so it's a shattering arrow.
Matt: All right, this'll take the remainder of your evening. You're not going to be able to do much else after this.
Taliesin: I have nothing else to do.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make a tinkering check with your intelligence modifier.
Taliesin: Okay. So... That's 23.
Matt: 23, okay. At the cost of roughly 150 gold pieces, as you have to go through a few different attempts to finally get the design right, and the metalworking you have here is not perfected. You're not at your workshop back at the keep, unfortunately, so you have to work with whatever you have here, and nothing here is designed for the--
Taliesin: No, I've got an okay workshop here.
Matt: Yeah. The one that you used before, previously, but that's from mostly discarded and-- in the time that you've been gone, it's been cannibalized for a lot of different uses. But it's makeshift. You manage to complete what you think could function. You're not entirely certain as to what the final effect will be, but it all seems to be in place.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: So you can write down 'Explosive Siege Arrow'.
Taliesin: Siege arrow.
Matt: And we shall find out in time what it does.
Marisha: Siege arrow. That's fun.
Taliesin: A few things I've been working on, and that's one of them.
Matt: So. Are you guys resting for the evening? Anything else you wish to accomplish?
Laura: That would probably be smart. I'm pretty tired after dying, so I'm going to go to sleep.
Matt: Okay. Vax, anything you want to accomplish before you--
Taliesin: God, the guilt. Okay. Yeah.
Sam: Can I buy a torch somewhere? Just a torch?
Matt: Sure! Yeah, torches are relatively easy to find. You want to try one?
Sam: Three.
Matt: Three torches. That's three copper.
Laura: I bring Trinket into the castle with me, just so you know.
Matt: After all this has happened, Trinket has been, like, almost locked to you. Even you going upstairs into the tavern, Trinket was like, (plaintive bear noises) stayed out front, 'cause Trinket's learned at this point, you can't really go into all the taverns.
Laura: It's hard, it's hard.
Matt: It's rough, being a bear.
Sam: And wherever we're eating, does it happen to be near Jameson the painter's workshop?
Matt: No, but it's about a 20-minute walk, if you wanted to go find him.
Sam: Be nice to check in with him. Grog, do you mind walking with me?
Travis: Absolutely not.
Sam: All right, so we'll truck on over to Jameson's.
Matt: Okay. You head up to it, and this gentleman is a painter as well as a stablehand, so you find your way to the facility, knock on it, and immediately as the door opens, the smell of fresh manure hits your nose and Jameson steps out. "Can I-- you!"
Sam: Yes! Hi!
Matt: "Hi!"
Sam: I've come back.
Matt: "I meant to deliver, but they told me not to, because apparently it's not there anymore?"
Sam: The town, you mean.
Matt: "Town, yeah, where I was supposed to deliver it to you."
Sam: It was wise of you to keep this precious artifact here, because it would've surely been destroyed en route or when it arrived--
Matt: "It's just the canvas, I don't have a-- It's a bit too large for my specifications of framing, but--"
Sam: I'm sure it's huge. Did you finish it?
Matt: "Yes, yes! Come, come!"
Sam: Can I look?
Travis: Oh please, oh please!
Sam: (laughing) Okay, let's go look!
Matt: He takes one of the hooded lanterns and turns up the oil wick on it, and as he turns away he brings you into the back stable area where it's been sectioned off, and you can see there's paints that have been dropped all across the ground and the hay, it's this multicolored spattering, this rainbow vomit across this section of hay floor, and there in all of its glory, stretched across and nailed at the corners to this far, far wall, you see a fantastical landscape of rolling hills and treelines rising up at the edges. You can see a mountainscape in the distance. The lighting he uses is magnificent. You can see why many people in the city specifically requested that you go to this gentleman. There atop this fantastic green hilltop, you see on this fine white and grey steed as it raises up, hooves in the air, is yourself, shirt open, chest slightly fuzzy and muscular. As you look off, your hair blowing in the breeze--
Sam: How's the face? How's the face?
Matt: The face is pretty damn spot-on.
Sam: Yes! (laughter)
Matt: The best likeness you can find for somebody who only had a brief reference, as he sketched you quickly before he left, and there behind, clutching you, from the side you can see Pike wearing these long greyish-silver and blue robes that are also flowing behind, a long train-- longer than it needs to be, stylistically it was a choice in the artistics point of this-- it is everything you hoped it would be. You paid good money for this piece.
Sam: I'm going to request-- Grog, I need a minute here.
Travis: Oh, yeah. I understand, take--
Sam: Just to weep.
Travis: Take all the time you need.
Sam: So I regard it for a few minutes, taking in the beauty and the wonder of all I've accomplished--
Marisha: I have a question. Would Keyleth and Scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time?
Matt: Right now? Yes. For different reasons entirely.
Sam: (singing) Somewhere out there...
Taliesin: (singing) Somewhere out there...
Travis: Look at the air, look at the air high-five. There it is.
Sam: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Taliesin: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Marisha: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Travis: So white. That was the whitest of white high fives ever.
Taliesin: I'm imagining this as a canvas of Lisa Frank majesty, by the way. Like, the greatest Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper cover in all the land.
Matt: Oh, man. (laughter)
Sam: After I weep for a few minutes, I thank Jameson again and how much did I pay him for this thing? You've gone above and beyond, Jameson, and I know that you're a humble man and you don't want me to spread word of your accomplishments, but please allow me to write you an epic poem or a song and tell of your artistic gifts and talents, please.
Matt: "That would be a fine tip, sir. Please, yes, do so."
Sam: I'll get right on it.
Matt: "Send them back to Whitestone, please, ask for Jameson. The more I work this, hopefully I can make my way out of this dunghole."
Sam: Don't worry, you'll have lots of commissions after this, I promise you.
Matt: "Great."
Sam: And I'm going to give him an extra 50 gold.
Matt: "I, um--"
Liam: That's more than the price of a book.
Matt: "Sir, I-- thank you. Thank you, thank you."
Sam: For art supplies to get your shop up and running.
Matt: "Of course." He looks down and he's gotten a little bit of paint on the coins, he's like, (muttering and stammering). He puts it aside somewhere. "Thank you--" Wipes his hands off on a nearby rag. "Thank you." And takes your hand and shakes it vigorously.
Sam: So, can it be--
Matt: Yeah, he goes in and he takes his little claw hammer down, starts pulling the nails out from the sides and gingerly rolls up the canvas. It takes a good, like, three minutes to roll the thing up, and it's quite heavy as he hands it over to you-- (heavy grunt) In your hand, yeah, it almost takes you off your feet.
Sam: Grog! Grog!
Travis: What?
Sam: Can you hold this for me?
Travis: No, it's you, I mean, you're so magnificent in it--
Sam: No, I can't do it.
Travis: I don't know it-- I really--
Sam: Grog! I watched you shit for an hour!
Travis: Hey, all right, I'll pick it up.
Matt: All right. You guys find your way out. At this point night has taken; you can hear the crickets starting to spread throughout the city. As the rest of the blue night sky takes on-- Evening is ready, do you guys have anything else to accomplish before the evening comes to a close?
Liam: Wait 'til it's quiet. And I leave the room that I've been given at Whitestone. And I find my sister's door. And I stand outside it, and I stare at it for a minute--
Laura: Vax? Is that you?
Liam: And I stealth away.
Laura: I open the door.
Matt: Roll a stealth check, roll a perception check.
Laura: Shit.
Liam: 25.
Laura: 22. Damn it.
Matt: Nothing to be seen. Must have been your imagination, Vex.
Travis: He's good.
Liam: And I wait for the door to close. And then I walk to Keyleth's door. And I knock.
Matt: You hear a knock at your door.
Laura: And horses.
Matt: The clomping of horse hooves in the distance, apparently.
Marisha: I open it. Hey. Hi. You okay?
Liam: I don't know.
Marisha: Come in. Sit down.
Liam: I go in.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: How do you feel?
Liam: I don't know. All I know is... that I felt her. I don't know magic, I don't know anything. I open doors, and only when the wind is blowing in the right direction, sometimes, I think. I don't know what happened, but I felt her.
Marisha: Do you still feel her?
Matt: Make a perception check, Vax.
Liam: 22.
Matt: As you're sitting there, looking down at the ground, as she asks this question, you notice the symbol of Sarenrae that you have stitched into the back of your glove, what was once a very vibrant, goldish-brass color has actually very heavily tarnished, and the metal itself seems to have cracked in three places. It was not this way a day before.
Liam: Yeah. I don't know if I did anything in there, and I wouldn't take it back if I did, but I don't know what I'm doing.
Marisha: I don't know if it was very noble or very stupid, to be honest. Probably a little bit of both. I can attempt a Greater Restoration spell, and see if I can sense anything.
Liam: I don't know anything about any of that. I'll let you.
Marisha: Can I?
Matt: Yeah. So as you prepare your mindset for the cleansing ritual that is the Greater Restoration--
Marisha: Just lay back.
Matt: As soon as the dull green energy begins to course across your fingertips, and as you touch the edge of his shoulder to impart his body with the cleansing energy, it courses through his shoulders, the spell completes. You sense no difference in your current physicality, mindset, and there's this pause, this silence, of no realization, that is suddenly shattered by the sound of a (caws). You look over and at the stone edge of the window you guys are staying in, you see stepping there a single dark raven, (clicks, rapid flapping) and it takes off and flies into the night.
Marisha: I think this goes beyond any natural realm that I have any bearing over. And I hug him. I thought I was going to lose you. And I'm terrified I'm still going to.
Liam: Keyleth, I love you.
Marisha: And I think I love you. I just don't know if I can allow myself to. I'm terrified to allow myself to. You do realize that, if by some crazy chance, we all somehow make it through this domination alive, with the Chroma Conclave, and I complete my Aramente, I'll still watch all of you die. Everything could go phenomenally well. And by becoming Headmaster, we enter a bit of a realm of immortality where I could live for a very, very long time. I'm afraid every time I look at one of your faces that it's going to be the last, and I feel like deep down I know that day is coming. So because of that I'm afraid to let myself feel anything deeper than I already do.
Liam: I quickly leave her room.
Matt: The door closes behind Vax.
Marisha: And for the second time today Keyleth bursts into tears. Why do people keep leaving me in rooms alone?
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Stop it, you're wasting water.
Marisha: We're in a drought, god damn it!
Laura: When was the last time you showered, Keyleth?
Marisha: It's been a while.
Taliesin: Makeup's runny.
Liam: Go water elemental.
Matt: It's the only way. All right, as you all find yourself coming to rest for the evening, some of you easier than others, eventually you get your full rest. Those who heal up to, say, full hit points for a good night's rest here, get your hit dice back, so not a whole lot were spent.
Travis: I lose my strength bonuses.
Matt: Morning comes to you all, and-- yes?
Liam: Sorry, just one detail. From there, I went and fell asleep in this idiot's doorway.
Matt: Okay. All right. We will go ahead and take a quick break, we will see you guys back here shortly to see what is in store for Vox Machina. So we'll be back here in a minute. [break]
Liam: Matt, shit on my face.
Matt: Welcome back, everybody!
Sam: It's too close!
Laura: They caught it, that one caught it.
Matt: That was pretty close.
Liam: All they heard was "ace."
Matt: It's all good. Welcome back, guys. We're going to go ahead and jump back in. So as you all, after that, for some, emotional evening, whether that be conversational emotion or, you know, having to go drop an emotional deuce. You know, that's important. You find yourselves waking up to a fresh morning in Whitestone, hints of blue sky breaking through the cloud coverage, and that's rare for this area because it's the northern portion of the continent, you know that, especially being so close to the ocean, a lot of the cloud, heavy precipitation makes its way in the direction of your town, so it's nice to have a little break in that. Nonetheless, as you guys come to consciousness and gather yourselves, your things, and your plans for the day, what do you wish to do?
Taliesin: We are a city of seasonal affectation disorder, so.
Laura: Well, I open my door and find my brother falling through it.
Liam: I'm awake.
Laura: Oh, good morning.
Liam: Hi.
Laura: Comfortable bed, I see.
Liam: Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't find my room.
Laura: Yeah, it's confusing, all these, all these doors.
Liam: What time's it?
Laura: I have no idea. My nature check tells me it's roughly, I dunno, eight? Nine? Something like that. Seven? Maybe seven.
Liam: Come here, you shithead. Don't fucking do that again.
Laura: It's not like I did it on--
Liam: Don't fucking do that again, all right? Just don't fucking do it again.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Fuck.
Laura: I can't breathe. You're about to kill me again.
Liam: You'll live, you'll live. Jesus. Whoever that is.
Laura: So-- (laughs) I heard a rumor that you sort of saved my life in a really creepy sort of way. I talk to people. I talk to so many people. I find out things. Secrets aren't safe when Vex is around.
Liam: Is there any coffee in this fucking castle?
Laura: Wait, wait, wait, I have a present for you, because I feel like you're going to really like it. Would you like it?
Liam: That's random. All right.
Laura: I have this armor that I think would be really great on you. Do you want it? It's really expensive. If you don't take it quickly, I might change my mi--
Liam: I don't want it.
Laura: Oh, that was expensive cardstock. (laughter)
Liam: I'll give you the leather armor after I have a chance to change.
Laura: All right. I love you.
Liam: (softly) I know. I know.
Laura: Let's get breakfast.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: From that point, the smell of coffee begins to fill the air from the inside of the Whitestone castle halls. The servants have prepared breakfast, and a meal is ready for you. Grog jumping to attention as the scent reaches your nose. The rest of you all slowly find your way back down. You eat--
Marisha: Do we come out and see Vax in the armor?
Matt: Are you putting on the armor?
Liam: I'm just looking at it in the hallway.
Marisha: So I guess I step out and see him looking at it in the hallway.
Liam: Still pretty tired, to be honest. Didn't sleep a lot in the doorway.
Matt: Yeah. Some of you guys step out, and you see Vax standing in the hallway, clutching in his hands, looking over all the various, like, pushed-in, engraved runes across the leatherwork, the raven feathers that adorn the bottom of the mantle.
Laura: Careful, it smells a lot like must and mold and birds.
Marisha: I walk by and... briefly lock eyes and keep going without saying anything.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Oh shit, you got the armor now?
Laura: He stole it, what can I say? He is a really sneaky, stealthy kind of guy.
Travis: Nice.
Laura: Yeah. Fair and square.
Liam: I just took it for fashion purposes, I suppose.
Travis: Oh, you need all the help you can get.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Should we go out in the woods and unleash an undead beast that will kill us all?
Travis: Yes! Christmas morning! Who has that, by the way?
Sam: I do.
Travis: Oh! Yeah!
Sam: Don't worry, it's safe.
Travis: Where d'you keep it?
Sam: Oh! Hold on-- Got a pouch or some-- you know what? It's back in my room.
Matt: All right. You go retrieve it.
Sam: Got it!
Travis: Where's Percy?
Laura: Where's Pike? We should bring her with us. Can we bring Pike with us? I know she's taking care of Gilmore, but.
Sam: Mm, that's possibly more important. I think this thing'll be fine!
Laura: We need some sort of somebody that can heal, I think we've learned this for ourselves.
Sam: I can heal!
Travis: Yeah, we got potions, we're fine. It's probably, like, a big Saint Bernard. What's the big deal?
Laura: (sighs) Okay. We learn nothing, carry on.
Travis: Where's Percy?
Taliesin: I'm right here.
Travis: Oh! Shit, you were quiet. Hello.
Taliesin: (coughs) Hello. Good morning.
Travis: Need any coffee? An enema?
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: A coffee enema?
Taliesin: What!? No. I'm fine. Good morning.
Liam: I'm going to walk off with this shit.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And we go outside with the necklace.
Sam: Yeah, where're we headed?
Travis: The woods!
Laura: No. The caves. I thought we were going to the--
Marisha: Going to the caves on the edge of the woods.
Matt: Yeah. It's the caves that are--
Marisha: Going to go through the woods.
Liam: (sings) Into the woods!
Matt: So. You all gather together and make your way northwest of Whitestone, towards where you found the stone giant fortress and the series of caves that are in the mountain behind it. You get there; it's still seemingly abandoned. You case the area for a while. No noticeable movement other than a few woodland entities that exist in that vicinity.
Laura: Primeval Awareness! (radar sounds)
Matt: Okay. That is now the sound it makes every time you do it.
Laura: I like it.
Matt: Yeah, so hold onto that one. I'll make that a new ringtone sound for you guys. What are you looking for?
Laura: Oh, there's so many things I could sense!
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: What about sirens?
Laura: Sirens?
Travis: Wait, what are those things called? The things that took our horses the last time we were here?
Matt: Harpies?
Travis: Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Laura: Sure! Harpies.
Matt: For how many miles is it?
Laura: Six miles!
Matt: Six miles? Yeah, there's a few blips on the far, far western side of here. You get the essence way off in the mountains, there's maybe a small nest. Nothing that's immediately dangerous.
Laura: What about if I sit for one more minute and I think if I can sense any giants.
Matt: You do, to the far, far north. You get the sense that there is some sort of giant-based lifeform maybe two, three miles north of you.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: How's it look?
Laura: Well, I mean, clear of the things I checked for. No giants.
Travis: Sweet! Let's go! Up to the cave!
Matt: All right. So the fortress or the caves behind it?
Travis: Fortress or cave?
Laura: Were they both empty? I don't remember.
Taliesin: Everything was empty, if I recall.
Travis: Yeah. Small space.
Taliesin: Let's do the caves.
Laura: All right, sure. Cave.
Travis: Yeah. Cave.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Oh, if we stick to the woods, it's my favored terrain. If we go into a cave, not as much.
Sam: The caves would contain it. It can't fly away or anything.
Travis: So is it like, cave-fortress, are they same level? I can't remember.
Matt: It's a pathway that leads up into a small ravine in the mountain pass where you guys originally walked down into Whitestone. Up against the north side of where the mountain meets that ravine, there's a big stone fortress that is built into the side of the mountain, and then around that are a series of smaller caves.
Liam: (singing) Anything can happen in the woods.
Travis: Yeah, let's go to this fortress, then we got more room to move in case it does suck.
Sam: All right, fine, fortress.
Matt: You guys find your way inside, the cold morning air still has encompassed the stone floor itself, you can see there are still the scattered and slowly decomposing bits of meat and flesh in the far corner, you still see the splatters of blood that have turned black and cracked as it dried. No corpses here, as the corpses were retooled by the Briarwoods while they were in control. The fortress other than that is still empty, and seemingly untouched since you last left it.
Sam: All right, well, I'm just going to do it then!
Laura: Wait wait wait!
Marisha: Wait wait wait!
Marisha: Wait, there's doors open to the cave, right?
Sam: We're in a fortress.
Taliesin: We're in a fortress.
Marisha: Fortress. Whatever.
Matt: (laughs) Coffee's just starting to kick in for you guys.
Laura: Just barely! Do we have any buff spells or some shit that we should cast, to make us cooler?
Marisha: Should I throw a wall up?
Sam: A wall for what?
Marisha: Do I need to bar the entrance? Or are there doors?
Taliesin: Vex, by the way--
Matt: There are doors, but they're partially ajar where you left them.
Laura: Aww, put it on, it's useful!
Liam: No. We're not having this conversation.
Taliesin: Vex, by the way, I've got something for you.
Laura: What? Yes, dear?
Taliesin: And I pull out the arrow.
Laura: What is this?
Taliesin: This is an evening of unbridled guilt. Come here, let me show you. In theory, this is a siege arrow.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Shattering stone, shattering doors, breaking things that should not be broken.
Laura: Breaking hearts left and right?
Taliesin: If that is what you're after. It should work! Never forget you're my favorite, and I'm so sorry.
Laura: I kiss him on the cheek. Thank you, Percy.
Taliesin: That was much nicer than your brother.
Laura: Is that a black eye?
Taliesin: (stammering) I didn't sleep.
Laura: Huh. This is lovely, I can't wait to use it.
Taliesin: There'll be more.
Sam: All right, in three, two--
Travis: Wait hold on, hold on hold on!
Taliesin: In a circle! Aim it into the center of the circle.
Liam: And is it three-two-one, three-two-one-do it, or three-two-one and go,
Sam: On the one. On one.
Taliesin: It's Jenga, one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand four one-thousand.
Sam: Should one of us leave the room in case it comes out and paralyzes all of us? Just going to throw that out there.
Travis: Oh yeah, we should, what do you call it, spread out?
Laura: Yeah, definitely, let's all surround it and make sure we're not all clumped up.
Taliesin: If only someone had armor that could make them immune to paralysis.
Liam: That's not a bad idea, you get controlled by things. Maybe you could wait just a little bit further back?
Laura: This was somebody's pet, all right? It's probably not smart enough to take control of our minds.
Liam: That's a big if.
Travis: I don't mind stepping out, but I would like to be able to see.
Laura: Yeah yeah yeah!
Liam: Yeah! We won't shut the door, I just want you outside of any potential blast radius.
Taliesin: Let's spread out in a circle; we'll let it loose in the center, that way it can't even see all of us.
Laura: All right, I like it. It only gets to see Scanlan.
Sam: It can see me.
Laura: I'm going to stealth.
Sam: Well, when a thing is born, it latches on to the first thing it sees, like its mama.
Liam: Yes, we're going to hide.
Matt: All right, stealth check from both of you guys?
Marisha: So we're going to try and talk to it?
Laura: Yeah, Scanlan's going to talk to it.
Marisha: Scanlan? You prepared?
Laura: Natural 20!
Taliesin: You just teleport, there's like a phase effect.
Matt: The two of you back off and find the nearby shaded corners, where some of the haphazardly tossed hides and furs are in the corner, you vanish behind the alcoves keeping a watch.
Laura: Trinket, don't stand next to me, it gives it away. Go stand next to Keyleth!
Travis: Is there a doorway in the fortress?
Matt: Yeah, there's the main doorway you guys entered, which is two--
Travis: Can I stand in that, then?
Matt: Sure, you stand there, in the entranceway that's pushed open, which is wide enough for a giant to push through. You got a little bit of room to each side, but you're there.
Travis: Vax, is this g-- Vax?
Taliesin: It's fine, you're fine.
Sam: Here we go, guys.
Marisha: So, those two are stealthed-- I'm at Scanlan's left shoulder, back a bit.
Laura: And Trinket's next to you!
Marisha: And Trinket's next to me. I'm rolling with Trinket.
Taliesin: I've got a little bit of distance, yes, that's good.
Matt: All righty, and there's Percy here, and Travis is off this way. Good to know.
Sam: I don't know how to use this thing.
Marisha: Yeah, we don't know how to use it.
Sam: By the power of Raven's Slumber, I command thee: (yells) awaken! Beast! Cruel or otherwise! Face your new master, and know his name is Scanlan! (laughter)
Travis: (laughing) Oh, holy shit! Never could've been better.
Matt: As you spend your bonus action to release the gate hold on the crystal, you guys see as he thrusts his hands forward, there's a burst of shadow energy that, almost like someone throwing a big pot of water, this blackness goes out of it, and then as it hits the ground, it spills into smoke on the ground, and as that dark form stops, it is in the form of an about waist-to-lower-torso-height creature. As the form coalesces into its normal self, you can see before you, shaking its head, a rather large, dark grey and black wolf. (growls, snarls)
Sam: Easy, easy.
Travis: Told you it was a dog.
Sam: Garlic? Galdric, Galdric, easy, Galdric. Easy. We're friends. Here.
Matt: He's backing up a little bit, snarling. You see Trinket starts growling, (growls).
Laura: Trinket, be nice-- oh!
Matt: As you say that (snarls) it looks over at you in the far corner.
Laura: (whispers) I'm natural 20! That still didn't see me!
Marisha: I pet Trinket, like, 'Chill, chill, be cool'.
Matt: Trinket backs up a little bit, but still locking eyes. You can see this wolf now, its gums and teeth are bared, its fur is all puffed up, its tail is-- it's definitely holding its ground and trying to make itself look as intimidating as possible.
Sam: Is it a small beast?
Matt: This would be, technically, borderline medium. This'd be medium, technically.
Sam: I can only speak with small beasts.
Marisha: Wait, use Speak with Animals?
Liam: (laughs) She swatted me and said, 'Put your armor on,' so I'm doing it.
Matt: Okay. That'll take you about 15 minutes.
Laura: Aw.
Liam: 15 minutes! Well, guess I'm doing it.
Matt: All right. You don't just slip on leather armor. (chuckles)
Liam: No, I get that, I get that, I would've guessed two minutes.
Travis: Can somebody check to see if it's actually a wolf or just looks like one? Like, check it?
Laura: Can I use my perception?
Matt: You're a bit far away from it right now. You can try to get closer if you want.
Laura: Can I sneak?
Matt: Yeah, make another stealth check.
Laura: I do get advantage, because of my cloak. Sweet.
Liam: You should yell out, 'I'm stealthing'.
Laura: I'm stealthing! Damn it. 19?
Matt: Okay. As you begin making your way forward, it doesn't seem to notice you.
Laura: Hey, it doesn't?
Matt: No.
Laura: Can I see it better now to perceive it?
Matt: Looking right at it, and from your experience in the wild as well, and Keyleth, you're getting it, this does not appear to be anything beyond a large wolf.
Taliesin: I'm going to get on my knees and put out my hand and call it. Galdric, Galdric.
Matt: Go ahead and make an animal handling check.
Sam: Animal handling! We've never done that before!
Laura: If I help my brother get on the armor, will it happen faster?
Matt: Probably.
Laura: I help him put on the armor.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (whispering) Ow ow ow! That's too tight!
Laura: Well, you're not the same size as the other guy!
Taliesin: Yeah, it's a little bit better. Ten.
Matt: Ten. As you put out your hand, Galdric snarls, and as you say, "Here, boy." (growls and snaps) It lashes out at your hand. That is going to be-- That's a 21 to hit?
Taliesin: I'll take it.
Travis: Keyleth, can't you talk to, like, plants and shit?
Matt: You take six points of piercing damage as its jaws clench down on your hand, and you tear your hand away. You can feel the warmth flowing under the glove.
Taliesin: Gently, I'm gentle with it.
Marisha: I cast Speak with Animals.
Liam: I click my Boots of Haste!
Matt: You do?
Sam: Aren't you getting dressed?
Laura: He can dress faster!
Travis: Speed change.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Quick change.
Sam: Seven-and-a-half minutes! (laughter)
Matt: You guys all become immediately aware of the creaking of leather in the distance as the two siblings are in the process of fast-changing one of the other.
Laura: The rustle of feathers.
Marisha: Okay, I cast Speak with Animals. And I crouch down to the ground. And bow down a little bit, and I say: are you the one they call Galdric?
Matt: Looks over at you for a second. The growl stops, and its posture changes a little bit. It raises its nose. (sniffs)
Marisha: Was Purvan your master?
Matt: Looking at you as you guys hear Keyleth making this series of growling sounds.
Laura: Trinket totally understands you, no?
Matt: Strangely enough, Trinket does, Trinket's like, (confused bear noise).
Taliesin: Trinket is Scooby-Doo, apparently.
Travis: Shitballs! Taint! You going that way?
Marisha: Oh my god, I get a secret!
Sam: There are several items that are sold out at the store! If you'd like to go on and see what items have already sold out, check it out. (laughs)
Laura: We need to get more t-shirts in stock.
Sam: Yeah, we know that. We know that, guys. We know.
Laura: That needs to happen. But there is still the Critical Role logo t-shirt available. What is happening? What is he--
Sam: Is there a ring or something?
Laura: Is the ring still available?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: If the ring is still available, check out our ring!
Marisha: I can respond back, right? Your master died a great champion for the Raven Queen. He has been paid a great honor, and now the Raven Queen has chosen a new master.
Laura: I push Vax forward.
Matt: You've gotten maybe part of the tunic on. (laughter)
Sam: Is he Donald-Duck-ing it right now?
Matt: Practically. There are undergarments, but not much. It's, like, bare legs and knees, part of an arm. Yeah, he got thrust out of the changing room about 20 seconds into it.
Sam: Nice.
Liam: I still walk toward the wolf.
Taliesin: Waddle.
Liam: No no no, I did the top, I did the top, c'mon!
Matt: The wolf turns his head a little bit curiously.
Marisha: I continue to speak to the wolf.
Liam: And I kneel. And bow my head.
Marisha: A great darkness has fallen upon our lands. Upon Othanzia. We could use all of the assistance that we can achieve. Would you be willing to find a new purpose? Join Vax'ildan--
Liam: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yes?
Liam: Tell him to come forward and look into my eyes.
Laura: (whispers) That's a bad idea for dogs.
Liam: Tell him.
Laura: (whispers) It's gonna bite your face off.
Marisha: Galdric. Please. Approach your new master and look into his eyes.
Laura: Give him some chocolate, man!
Matt: The wolf looks towards you, looks towards the loosely half-dressed half-elf.
Marisha: Look into his eyes. I said look into his eyes. And see the touch of the Raven Queen inside of him.
Matt: Wolf slowly stalks towards you across the stone floor. You can hear the claws of the wolf clattering against the stonework. As you can see it's partially, like, digging into the stonework with each step. It has purpose with each stride.
Liam: As it's coming, I'm taking daggers out and throwing 'em on the ground.
Matt: The wolf stops and looks up at you. Turns around and walks towards the doorway where you are.
Sam: Where who is?
Matt: Where Grog is. Grog, who's now at the door, at the exit.
Laura: (whispers) What's his name?
Taliesin: Galdric.
Marisha: Galdric.
Marisha: Galdric!
Matt: Keeps walking.
Laura: Galdric!
Sam: Going to stop him, Grog?
Travis: Well, I'm in the doorway.
Marisha: Grog, don't move. Don't move. Look at the dog. Don't move, and don't hurt the dog. Please just look at the dog.
Laura: I pull out one of my treats I have for Trinket.
Matt: Okay. Trinket starts lumbering up towards you (thudding).
Laura: Wait, wait, Trinket-- This is for your buddy Galdric. Galdric!
Matt: Just keeps walking, doesn't even look at you in the face, walks--
Laura: I throw the treat and say, hey!
Matt: It scatters across the stone. Walks between your legs and exits out.
Travis: I pivot on my back foot. I take out Craven Edge--
Taliesin: No!
Travis: No, I do, I take out Craven Edge and I sink it into the earth right beside his head. And I say, (shouts) heel!
Matt: Make an animal handling check.
Laura: Whoa, is it good, is it good?
Travis: 20.
Matt: As the sword (crack) into the rock outside of this fortress, it probably embeds itself a good foot and a half into the mountain. You guys all hear Grog's shout echo through the inside of the fortress itself, causing little bits of dust and small pebbles to dislodge from the roof, slowly fall down. The wolf has stopped and spun in its place and reached out and lashed the blade with its jaws and (cling) as it releases it.
Travis: Stay.
Matt: He sits.
Travis: That went well! (laughter)
Sam: Dog whisperer!
Travis: Good pup.
Sam: Are you its master now?
Travis: No, no, I don't think it has a master. This is a very powerful beast. But it needs a firm hand. And I think it needs a job. So. What do we plan to do with Galdric? Said his name right?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: We plan on having him help us kill some dragons?
Taliesin: I think he's a wolf. I think perhaps something a little less ambitious.
Laura: Trinket hides very well when dragons are around.
Taliesin: I think, perhaps, joining the Whitestone conclave might be a-- Having him guard Whitestone, perhaps.
Laura: Good, yeah! I like it!
Travis: I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull out one thing of dry food rations, and a probably pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain.
Liam: Where did we get that?
Travis: Oh, there's a veritable Walmart of shit in this bag. (laughter)
Travis: And I, like a hamburger patty, smash it all together.
Matt: The only reason you even know this was at one point dark elf brain matter is because that's what you willed to reach in and find. It does not at all visually match your memory of its--
Travis: Does it have a little bit of a viscous-y ooze, mostly?
Matt: Oh yeah, no, it's--
Travis: It'll soften up the dry food.
Liam: Gray Chicken McNuggets.
Matt: It'll soften up a lot of things. It's pretty terrifying.
Laura: It'll make the wolf vomit.
Travis: So I throw that on the ground, and I pour a little ale on top of it. (laughter)
Sam: Wolves love getting drunk.
Matt: Very good. It leans forward and smells it.
Travis: Yeah, no, it wasn't the best, I can do better. Okay.
Laura: Trinket goes up and starts eating it.
Travis: He's going to barf that all over the carpet later.
Liam: Forget the chocolate.
Travis: I need to carry beef in this bitch.
Taliesin: It goes bad.
Liam: We have Dork! We've got nothing of Dork left?
Laura: Oh, you know what I have, by the way? I still have, like, a cooler Bag of Holding. That we got from the Slayer's Take.
Travis: Oh! That's really good to know.
Travis: I pour into a little chalice some ale.
Laura: Like, it keeps things cold. Yeah, it's like a little bitty one, but it keeps parts from going bad.
Matt: It's nowhere near as large as a Bag of Holding, but it has a slow stasis for organic goods.
Sam: We should keep some food on hand next time!
Laura: Totally!
Travis: I offer him some ale, just to see if he even likes it. Some dogs like beer, some others don't.
Matt: Mm. Wolf doesn't seem to be interested.
Travis: Yeah, all right. Then I chug it.
Sam: So are we telling this wolf something or commanding it to come with us as we return to town?
Taliesin: I think he would be helpful to guard the town, at this point.
Laura: Well, he'll follow Grog, I suppose.
Sam: Let's go back to town and bring him with us.
Travis: All right.
Matt: You guys return to Whitestone. It's another, like, three-hour trek to find your way back down to the city. Stalks up next to you. Definitely seems to be attentive to your commands. Doesn't appear to be a bond per se, but of everyone that it's encountered so far, you're the only one that really gathered its respect.
Laura: I threw a treat at it. I don't understand.
Travis: That's a great thing to throw at a giant 400-pound bull mastiff.
Marisha: I spoke words at it. Apparently that's not good enough. Communicating.
Travis: Right, so we're walking back to town. We've got a giant fuck-off wolf with us. Vax looks like Edward Scissorhands.
Liam: I'm peeling that off as we walk.
Laura: What?
Travis: What?
Travis: No!
Laura: Leave it the fuck on!
Liam: I'm peeling it off.
Laura: It's really expensive. What, do you want to damage it?
Liam: I'm peeling it off.
Laura: (quietly) Fuck, he doesn't appreciate presents.
Matt: All right, so you take what little bit of the armor you had on, off, and are you putting your other armor back on?
Laura: He doesn't have any other armor. I took his armor.
Liam: I have regular fucking armor that I grew up in with you, you fucking shit.
Sam: Do you want to trade with me, Vax? I've got some armor you could take.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: You're a funny man.
Matt: All right, so you're back in town and you have a wolf.
Travis: Do we find a holding pen for the wolf?
Taliesin: I don't think we need to. I think we can communicate to him--
Laura: No. Tell him not to attack villagers.
Taliesin: Ask him if he'll be willing to keep the town safe.
Laura: Do it in a really aggressive way, though, Keyleth. Stern.
Marisha: Very aggressive? Okay. Okay.
Sam: We should find some food for the thing, too.
Marisha: If I turned into a dog. If I turned into a wolf, do you think he'd respect me more?
Laura: No, he'll probably attack you.
Travis: He'll mount you.
Laura: Or he'll bone you.
Taliesin: I'm not ready for that game.
Sam: Do it.
Travis: Let's be clear. (laughter)
Laura: Matt's like, "mm-mm."
Liam: Oh, you soured the DM. (laughter)
Taliesin: To be fair, that's happened before.
Laura: Yeah, I remember.
Taliesin: With the troll.
Travis: With the troll. It was so good. That was you, wasn't it?
Taliesin: No, it wasn't me. Was it you?
Sam: I don't know.
Travis: Who was getting humped on?
Taliesin: I don't remember.
Sam: Finalize this wolf so we can go kill something.
Marisha: I take my staff and I say, Galdric! I'm being assertive.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: She's the alpha.
Laura: (whispering) Grog, go stand behind her.
Marisha: You want a task? I'll give you one.
Matt: All right. How long does Speak With--
Marisha: I don't know.
Matt: It lasts for ten minutes, so you can cast it again. It's first level.
Marisha: Oh, has it not been ten minutes?
Matt: It has been more than ten minutes. It took you three hours to return.
Marisha: Okay, we walked back? Okay, I'll cast it again.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Can I cast Speak With Animals on other people? I can't, right? No.
Matt: All right, so as you shout, go ahead and make an animal handling check, with advantage because of your ability to speak.
Marisha: With advantage?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I'll take the-- what is that, 16? Plus a six, so 22.
Matt: Okay. Galdric turns to you and essentially leans towards you and you get the essence, the idea of a message across, and to keep me from having to walk behind now, at this point, as you guys have managed to make seeming amends at the moment, employs the idea of, "I'll listen if you give me a task."
Marisha: He talked back.
Laura: Have him guard the village.
Marisha: Okay. (louder) Galdric. Only a beast of your great fortitude--
Laura: Just fucking tell him to do it!
Marisha: Right, okay. Sorry. Would you like to guard--
Sam: It's a command.
Marisha: -- the town, Whitestone? (shouting) Guard this town, dog.
Travis: Keyleth, repeat after me.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: In exchange for food, protect these lands.
Marisha: Galdric. In exchange for food, shelter, and a cozy fire every once in awhile--
Travis: I didn't say that shit. I didn't say that. He's a wolf. He doesn't need those.
Marisha: Patrol these lands.
Laura: Protect these lands.
Marisha: Protect these lands.
Travis: (quietly) Holy shit.
Matt: "For how long?"
Laura: (laughs) He already asked that.
Marisha: Why does he want details? Why does the dog want--
Laura: As long as we need you to.
Travis: No, no. A great danger approaches.
Taliesin: Until the danger has passed.
Travis: You'll know it when it comes.
Marisha: (clears throat) A great danger--
Laura: Approaches!
Marisha: Approaches! A great danger approaches. Your service is required until that danger--
Taliesin: Has passed.
Marisha: Has passed! Is no longer in effect. You'll know. You'll know, because they're fucking dragons, man. You'll know. Protect--
Travis: I walk over and put my hand over Keyleth's mouth. You stay. We feed you. Is there a tavern or a butcher shop or something nearby?
Matt: There is a butcher. As you're having this thought, however, Galdric turns back over to you and says, "I can feed myself."
Laura: Yeah, you can.
Matt: "But I will watch until this danger has passed."
Laura: Awesome.
Matt: "Then am I free to go?"
Marisha: Then you are free to go.
Matt: "Very well. I grow tired of service. I wait too long." And the wolf looks at you, gives you like an acknowledgement, and then walks off into the woods.
Laura: Bye, buddy!
Marisha: Thanks, Galdric. Appreciate it, man.
Laura: Man, that's a cool-looking wolf.
Marisha: I look at Grog. How was that? Did that sound okay?
Travis: That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard. (laughter)
Taliesin: You did good, you did good.
Sam: I thought she did very well.
Marisha: Thank you. It really liked you. You should learn how to talk to animals.
Laura: What is that? What is that you have? What is that?
Taliesin: I'm holding onto the Raven's Slumber jewel at the moment.
Sam: The thing that can capture evil.
Taliesin: It's empty now, and do you know what I bet would fit in it very nicely?
Travis: Me.
Laura: And we can carry him around and then pop him out. Wait, okay, wait. Is it going to hurt him? Does it hurt him? Is it like, it's bad?
Sam: Not only does it not hurt him, he does not age or feel any pain.
Travis: A willing creature need not make a saving throw.
Taliesin: It's automatic, and no time passes.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to try it, and I'm going to try it, and just to see how he likes it. If he's okay with it.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hey, buddy, come here.
Matt: As you turn around and look, you see there's a small puddle on the ground where Trinket has vomited up. He's pushing dirt over it.
Travis: Yeah, you got to teach him to quit rummaging, that is really foul.
Laura: What was that? Trinket, what did you eat? Don't eat the puke. Do not eat the puke. Come here.
Matt: Trinket's like scraping dirt over it.
Travis: Got a carrot on your chin.
Laura: Trinket. Do you want to go for a ride? You like rides? Yeah? You want to go for one? All right, sit still. This'll be fun. I don't know how to use it.
Taliesin: Just point, yep.
Laura: I point to him with the--
Sam: You should probably say something cool.
Laura: By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you my Pokemon. (laughter)
Matt: Words be damned. It takes you an action or so to activate the crystal, but as you do, Trinket gives a confused look before Trinket's shadow seems to crawl up his legs until it forms into this circle, this dark core, roughly half the size of Trinket's form, before it shoots into the crystal.
Laura: Is he about this size, but I don't like that one, is he about this size?
Matt: A little larger than that before he goes into the crystal, but once he's in the crystal, it's small.
Laura: Oh, it's a little crystal?
Liam: Trinkachu, I choose you.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my gosh. That's really fun. Okay. How do I let him go?
Marisha: I think you-- yeah.
Laura: I release you.
Matt: Okay. As you do that, once again the same dark energy you saw earlier spills out and hits the ground in front of you, and from that dark shadow area Trinket's form emerges, standing there looking really confused.
Laura: How was it? Did it hurt? Can you talk to him? You can still talk to him. Talk to him. Ask him if it hurt.
Matt: (vomiting noises) Vomits a little bit more on the ground.
Laura: Well, that's not good.
Marisha: You know, sometimes the teleportation makes you lose your lunch.
Laura: Ask him how he's doing.
Marisha: Trinket? You all right buddy? You all right, there?
Matt: "Feeling sick."
Laura: Ask him how the little car ride was, ask him if he liked the ride.
Marisha: How was the ride? Did you feel all right? How was--?
Matt: "Yeah?"
Laura: Okay, would you mind, ask him if he'd mind doing that on occasion, you know, whenever I need him to.
Marisha: What was it like in there? Was it--?
Matt: "I don't remember."
Marisha: Okay, that's good, that's good. Would you mind--
Laura: Ask him if he cares if I do it again, ask him if he cares.
Marisha: Would you mind doing that, you know, frequently? On occasion. MATT "If she wants me to, okay."
Laura: What did he say, what did he say? He looked really cute when he said something.
Marisha: You have a lot of men who will do anything for you.
Laura: Oh, buddy! I go and hug him really tight and scratch his ears.
Matt: You do, and avoid the little bit of--
Laura: --vomit on, I don't even care! Oh my gosh, thank you! This is the best, this is the best and we can travel with him, we can climb with him, we can sneak around.
Sam: Hey, and if Trinket isn't in it, you can also use it to capture baddies.
Laura: I know, it's great!
Taliesin: And because of the way that the projection works, you could also in theory capture a baddie and then let them loose off a cliff and watch them drop.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Oh my god, you're right.
Taliesin: It's very convenient.
Laura: Oh my gosh. Okay.
Matt: So. You have a crystal, you've set a wolf on a path.
Sam: Where are we going next?
Matt: Where are you going now?
Taliesin: Your home, I imagine.
Laura: Don't we need to--oh, yeah.
Sam: What's our to-do list?
Marisha: We don't have to worry about it. We can, it's fine.
Taliesin: Fire Ashari it is.
Sam: Wait, wait, wait. What are the things that we need to do?
Laura: We need to check in on Keyleth's family.
Sam: Cobalt Reserve, Ashari.
Laura: Grog's family.
Sam: Did we already take care of Osysa's mate, Frostweald?
Laura: No, but that's down--
Taliesin: That's far.
Marisha: That's the other Vestige, correct?
Laura: Yes, that's over by Grog's family.
Matt: That's information about the Vestiges.
Sam: We need to steal an airship.
Taliesin: I agree, that's still very important.
Travis: I can't remember where, what--
Laura: They were by Kraghammer.
Travis: Thank you. I'm having terrible hiccups.
Sam: What about, we need to find Kaylie at some point. We also need to, who's gone, where's Allu-- where's Ki-- where's people?
Laura: Allura should be here in like a day. She should be here very soon.
Travis: What's close to here? (hiccups)
Taliesin: Nothing's close, we're specifically far away from everything.
Marisha: But we can go wherever we want as long as we've been there before.
Travis: Well, we should definitely go to the Fire Ashari.
Taliesin: Fire Ashari is the next--
Laura: We should go to the Fire Ashari.
Marisha: Oh god, I'm immediately nauseous.
Matt: (bear noises)
Liam: That's two of us.
Marisha: Oh, Trinket, buddy. What time is it?
Laura: (laughs) Do you need some water?
Matt: It's still, with the travel to and from, it's middle afternoon, like one o'clock in the afternoon.
Taliesin: Take it.
Sam: If we're going to go, do we need anything before we leave? We got everything we need? Potions and stuff? Want to buy some meat for your cooler?
Laura: Yeah, let's get some meat.
Matt: It's pretty easy to go ahead and procure it, five gold of meat will fill that thing.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: So go ahead and mark five gold off your paper.
Sam: How much, could I buy a medical kit somewhere?
Matt: Yeah, you could find a general store and purchase a medical kit.
Sam: How much is that?
Matt: I'm going to look that up right now.
Sam: All right, whatever, I've got it.
Taliesin: It's nifty that you have a book that tells you how much something like that costs.
Matt: Imagine that. It's like it's a handbook of some kind, it's crazy.
Marisha: Does anyone have any fire-resistant items?
Laura: He does.
Liam: I do.
Laura: Put it on.
Marisha: I might pick up some fire resistant potions as well.
Travis: I have this black iron plate that I haven't used ever. 'While wearing this heavy plate 'armor, the bearer gains resistance to any fire damage.'
Matt: Five gold for an herbalist's kit for you.
Laura: Oh, plate armor, none of us can wear it but Pike.
Matt: An herbalist's kit, like five gold.
Sam: Can that stabilize people?
Matt: If used with a medicine check, yeah.
Laura: Okay, I have this, which I can't wear.
Taliesin: What is that?
Laura: It's a purple and black robe. It was Lady Briarwood's robes.
Taliesin: What does it do?
Laura: Clings to nearby darkness as you walk. While wearing this robe, you gain resistance to piercing damage. Anybody need pierce resistance that can wear robes?
Taliesin: I'm pretty reasonable.
Sam: Do I wear robes?
Matt: Robes would be worn instead of your armor.
Sam: No thanks.
Laura: What about Gloves of Missile Snaring? That appeal to anyone?
Sam: Missile snaring? What does that do?
Laura: These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them, and when a ranged weapon attack hits you, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity modifier provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to zero, you can catch the missile if it's small enough to hold in that hand.
Taliesin: Does it require attuning?
Marisha: They're pretty sleek.
Laura: It requires two, no it just requires one free hand.
Taliesin: Yes, but does it require attuning?
Laura: Yes it does, it requires attuning.
Taliesin: I might be attuned out at this point.
Laura: Anybody? I feel like that could be cool for you, Scanlan.
Sam: I think I can take it?
Taliesin: What's your dex? Your dexterity is not very-- actually, it might work out well for me, weirdly enough.
Marisha: Are you fully attuned?
Taliesin: I can undo something that I'm not using.
Marisha: Percy, you have access here in Whitestone to alchemy supplies, correct?
Taliesin: Matt, I have access to alchemy supplies here in Whitestone, correct?
Matt: (laughs) I mean, there are elements of your initial workshop I guess, that a lot of supplies have been cannibalized but a few things can be pieced together. Plus there was a lot of alchemical elements and tools that were utilized in the subterranean tunnels as part of the refinement process for the whitestone residuum, the large vats of acid that were distilled by the Briarwoods while they were here, and there are other elements of their own tinkering in the alchemical arts that remain scattered throughout the castle. So yeah, you can definitely find enough to tinker with if you want.
Marisha: I mean, we could take the rest of the evening and I can attempt to make some fire resist potions.
Sam: Eh.
Travis: All right, here's what I'm thinking, right? I mean, if we go after my herd, we're in for a fight. A big one. If we go to your Fire Ashari, we're doing recon and hopefully learning something, right?
Marisha: Well, we're going to be in for a fight at the Fire Ashari as well because there's a giant sunder in the fire plane, and last time I checked there were fire imps and elementals pouring through there.
Travis: Are those bad?
Taliesin: Eh.
Marisha: They're annoying
Taliesin: As long as we're quick we can go about it.
Marisha: Well.
Sam: What's our mission?
Travis: You really want to get the rest of the testicles of--
Marisha: I mean, we could theoretically see if there are survivors and I can attempt to close the tear in the plane. I don't know if I can do that. However, I don't know anyone else particularly more qualified to attempt it.
Travis: Allura or that bearded dude.
Marisha: We're talking about the Fire Ashari and possibly what to do there.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: We can go and look for survivors--
Laura: And bring them here.
Marisha: And someone should probably close the tear in the fire plane.
Laura: Should we wait for Allura then, before we go?
Travis: Well, if there are survivors, they might not be that way for very long if we don't go.
Laura: They've been there for a while already.
Marisha: If there are survivors--
Laura: Then they're surviving.
Marisha: They've survived. I agree. It's not going to be pretty.
Taliesin: I know you don't want to go.
Marisha: I really don't.
Taliesin: But we need to go. I say we take the rest of the day. You make your potions, we leave first thing in the morning.
Laura: Wait for Allura, hopefully she'll be here by then.
Taliesin: Maybe Allura will join us by tomorrow morning. If not, we teleport over.
Matt: Okay, you guys are going to rest for the evening?
Travis: Wait, hold on, is there like a house of entertainment in Whitestone? I know it's just getting back on its feet but you know.
Matt: That would be a question more for Percival.
Travis: Percy? I'm having a bit of a soul struggle and I'm wondering if I might bend your ear for a moment.
Taliesin: Sure.
Travis: Yeah, could I speak to you over here?
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Travis: Right, so, like, I want to get my freak on.
Taliesin: I don't feel that way about you. (laughter)
Travis: Yeah, no, I, I'm sorry.
Taliesin: I mean, you're very attractive.
Travis: That was very unclear. So I know this is like your home and stuff and you might not have been aware of it, but they have these houses where like....
Taliesin: Oh, where you get your freak on!
Travis: Yes.
Taliesin: Yes. Yes, we have them.
Travis: Oh good, do you think they're still in order?
Taliesin: Oh, I imagine so.
Travis: Could you point me in that direction?
Taliesin: No, I have no idea where they are. I do know that they exist. I actually had things to do here. I didn't have time for these.
Travis: Oh yeah, me too, important things. I was thinking for Scanlan in case he gets bored, you know, you've got to keep him focused.
Taliesin: I wouldn't actually know where any of these places were, would I?
Matt: No, and those that did exist in this town have not been...
Taliesin: I figured as much. I'm just fucking with him. Okay. No.
Travis: Oh, okay, well, I'll let Scanlan know. Just keep it between you and me 'cause he's very sensitive about these things.
Taliesin: Your secret is safe with my indifference. That's fine.
Travis: Well, my, my, indifference
Taliesin: I know you do.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: You're wonderful.
Marisha: Can I start telling that to people in real life?
Taliesin: Yes you can. I do it all the time.
Marisha: Yes. Your secret is safe with my indifference.
Travis: Okay. I'm going to rest.
Sam: Before we set off on this, is there anything closer or more pressing? I don't actually know why we're going to her place, but I'm fine with it.
Marisha: To look for survivors and close the giant tear in the fire plane that evil, well not evil, fiery entities are pouring through.
Taliesin: It's a hellmouth, it's basically a hellmouth.
Travis: It's either that or we go goliath hunting.
Laura: That's next.
Taliesin: But this is quick, this is something that we can knock off the list.
Sam: All right, let's knock it off.
Travis: Yeah, right, let's just check it off.
Liam: As we're walking through town, do I see any weaponsmiths?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: Okay.
Taliesin: I'll help you make the potions.
Liam: 21.
Matt: Okay, that'll help cut down on the time. 21? There are two functional smiths left in the town. There were two more than that overall, that were more like blacksmithy, but they both unfortunately lost their lives in the insurrection. But there are two functional blacksmiths in this, yeah.
Liam: And one's nearby, to pass through?
Matt: About a ten-minute diversion.
Liam: I'm splitting off from the group.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: We've got to get out of here.
Liam: One's in front of me now?
Matt: Well, you find your way to-- it's a small blacksmith, and most of it's outside. Though the day is growing late, you do see an older gentleman, long, tattered grey hair pulled into a very tight bun in the back and a beard that is actually tied off to the side. Otherwise it would be hanging down into his work. He's wearing soot-covered clothes, big leather apron, leather gloves, and he's currently in the process of (ping ping) turning over and hammering out a piece of orange glowing steel.
Liam: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, I have a very simple request.
Matt: He doesn't stop. He seems to, he acknowledges your presence but he's still working as he's listening. (smithing sounds)
Liam: I have six gold burning a hole in my pocket. I'm not looking for anything simple. Do you have a short sword? A regular old shortsword.
Matt: (ting) He looks over at you. "If that's what you're looking for, on that wall over there we've got two shortswords." (ting)
Liam: What's the difference between the two that I can see?
Matt: (smithing sounds) That you can see? Make a perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: Looking over them both, from this distance, they're both made with different hilt designs and different pommel designs, the grips are a little different but other than that the blades are pretty much identical.
Liam: I grab one off the wall. I slap down six gold, which I know is way too much and say, thank you sir. Pelor lives here. And I walk away.
Matt: Okay, as you start walking away he goes, "Hey."
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: "You're going to pay proper for that shortsword."
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry. How much does it cost?
Matt: "12 gold pieces."
Liam: My apologies. 12?
Matt: "12 gold pieces, friend."
Liam: So I put down six. I put down another 14. I really apologize. I was just confused.
Matt: "It's all right. No harm no foul." Takes the gold and scoops it and puts it into his pouch. "Have a good day."
Liam: I walk down the street going like-- it's big.
Matt: It's much bigger than you're used to, but it's got a fine balance to it and it's well-made. All right, so as you guys have all--
Laura: I've got an opal dagger you could have used.
Liam: I don't need your dagger.
Taliesin: We're going to make our potions?
Matt: Yes, yes. All right, so.
Marisha: I have another question.
Matt: What is your other question?
Marisha: Before we all go to bed tonight can we get like a fuckton of the green stone under Whitestone?
Taliesin: There's really not a lot of it.
Marisha: Say like $1,000 worth and maybe have like a real nice Heroes' Feast before tomorrow?
Liam: Wise as fuck.
Laura: Or in the morning.
Liam: Heroes' Breakfast.
Marisha: I've got to do it at night, because I have to Tree Stride in the morning.
Matt: You can choose either to create the potion or to mine the residuum for the evening. You cannot do both. Both are time, like, to pull that material from the-- because most of it that remains has been already embedded within the ziggurat beneath. You would actually have to physically chip it from the structure.
Laura: I have a plan, Keyleth.
Marisha: Yes?
Laura: We will cover the 1,000 gold from our own party funds and have someone here mine some shit for us and give it to us later.
Marisha: I like that plan, yeah. Sounds good to me.
Sam: How about the wolf?
Taliesin: So potions.
Laura: Percival, do you have people here who can mine? Looking for work, people--?
Marisha: Yeah, sure, why not?
Taliesin: I'll let them know that they should start trying to pull the residuum out of the wall, but it's dangerous down there.
Laura: Yeah, it is.
Taliesin: And tampering with it is definitely...
Travis: Necessary.
Taliesin: Should be ginger. It would, I'm trying to keep everything ginger down there.
Laura: So maybe we should take 1,000 gold just from your family stores then, huh? That might be smarter.
Taliesin: We currently have 1,000 gold from my family stores that are in the group treasury at the moment.
Laura: Oh, we do. No, that's 500. That was just 500. Just so you know.
Taliesin: I feel like it was more than that.
Laura: No, it was just 500.
Liam: Hey, de Rolo, do you remember what happened yesterday?
Taliesin: He's not there.
Laura: Isn't he, though?
Taliesin: I was going to do such a nice thing for you, but never mind now.
Laura: (laughs) No, no, no, do something really nice for me.
Liam: Where did I go? Oh, I went to buy a shortsword.
Taliesin: No, never mind. You went to buy a shortsword.
Laura: Dear, dear, dear, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Do nice things. All right?
Taliesin: I'm trying to be gentle with my family right now. They're taking on an awful lot.
Laura: You're right. They're taking on so many people.
Taliesin: And we'll see what we can do.
Liam: I'd like to think you hear me in your mind.
Taliesin: Always fucking hear you in my mind.
Laura: Let's just use the damned party funds for the time being. It's fine, Keyleth. This is a really important feast.
Taliesin: We're busy making potions.
Laura: All right.
Matt: So you prepare a Heroes' Feast before you begin this potion-creation process? Is that what I understand or not?
Laura: What?
Marisha: Can I make some potions and then, like, I make dinner for us before we go to bed?
Matt: It's going to take you about the length of a day to create the potion, with his help it takes it to about half, so it'll be about 12 hours of creating. Eight to 12 hours. So.
Travis: Pick one.
Taliesin: Pick one.
Marisha: I'll do a damn feast.
Taliesin: No potion?
Matt: You can do the potion as well. The feast only takes a moment to cast.
Marisha: All right, okay. Yeah.
Matt: I'm just saying, be aware that you guys will probably have, if you want to get a full rest after that potion creation process, you're going to have to wait until like this time tomorrow, like late in the day to make your journey. Which is fine, if you're willing to be patient about it.
Travis: Sure.
Matt: Yes, no?
Travis: Say one, just say one.
Marisha: Yeah, let's do it, let's do it. Let's go in prepared and then we can always rest on that side.
Matt: Cool. For a fine, fine dinner.
Laura: Just want to make sure we feast right before we leave so that it's most useful.
Matt: All right, so. You, everyone else goes to sleep while you and Percy work tirelessly through the night. If I could have you--
Liam: Fuck!
Matt: (laughs) Just for the sake of it, I want you to go ahead and make an arcana check.
Marisha: Aw, an arcana? Do I get advantage because of my little skill in alchemy? I'm skilled in alchemy.
Matt: Yeah. Oh, that's right you are, never mind, go ahead and do that.
Matt: Proficiency bonus, are you proficient in alchemy?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So proficiency bonus, and for this, use intellect modifier.
Marisha: Okay. Intellect, which makes it plus seven. Do I have advan-- ooh, I rolled a natural 19.
Matt: Okay. We'll say, for the fair cost of, reduced due to the roll, 450 gold pieces, you create a potion of resistance of your choice of resistance.
Marisha: Just one?
Matt: Just one.
Marisha: Fire.
Matt: It takes a long time, man.
Marisha: Fire!
Matt: Fire, all right. You create a potion of fire resistance. The materials cost you 450 gold to create, you finish it by about sunrise the next day. Everyone else begins slowly waking up after the night's rest as you guys both, bags under your eyes.
Laura: Oh, that was a good night's sleep, I tell you what.
Travis: Seriously.
Sam: Keyleth, could you--
Marisha: What? Oh, god, you snuck up on me.
Sam: Could you make me some tea real quick?
Marisha: Scanlan.
Sam: What?
Marisha: Go fuck yourself.
Sam: What, you were up before me, I thought--
Taliesin: All right. All right, this is fine.
Marisha: This is fine.
Taliesin: This is good.
Marisha: This is great.
Matt: You're doing a Heroes' Feast for breakfast, then? Is that how it's working?
Marisha: I'll take a nap. I'll cook breakfast, guys, good morning. Good morning!
Laura: Oh hey, good morning, Keyleth!
Sam: Why don't you sleep during the day, we'll all take our feast, and then blast off at night time?
Marisha: Because I have to teleport and cooking this feast are both 6th-level spells and I can only do one of those a day.
Travis: Man, it's hard being a druid.
Laura: Can anybody else make a feast? That's here?
Marisha: Pike. Pike. Pike?
Sam: She's with Gilmore.
Travis: She's not here.
Laura: (sighs) I miss Pike.
Liam: We all miss Pike.
Marisha: I'll cook breakfast, guys.
Laura: No, I'll cook breakfast. No, I won't cook breakfast.
Liam: That's a good idea, for you to not cook breakfast.
Matt: What's the plan?
Marisha: I'm cooking breakfast!
Matt: Are you cooking breakfast or are you summoning breakfast? That's my question.
Laura: Are you summoning breakfast and then you're sleeping and then we're leaving?
Marisha: I'm summoning-- yes, I'm summoning breakfast and then I'm sleeping.
Laura: And then you're sleeping and then we're leaving as soon as you wake up.
Matt: Okay, that's what I was wondering. We got the answer, okay, cool. Hoo, today's been a slog. All right, so you go ahead and you use Heroes' Feast, summoning forth a fantastical breakfast meal filled with coffee and eggs and everything you would hope for, the finest materials.
Laura: Froot Loops!
Matt: (laughs) Sure, Froot Loops is on the menu, why not?
Taliesin: Lucky Charms.
Matt: No Lucky Charms, sorry, those aren't available on Tal'Dorei. But yes, all you guys take an hour to finish devouring this, you finish your meal, all you guys get a 2d10 hit point maximum increase to your hit points.
Laura: Ooh, ooh, greens, greens!
Matt: And immune to poison, frightened, and all wisdom saving throws have advantage.
Travis: Damn!
Sam: Advantage on wisdom.
Matt: Yes, the usual.
Travis: Almost broke.
Marisha: And wisdom.
Laura: And you're immune to fear, right?
Marisha: Immune to fear, poison, and what else?
Matt: And you get advantage on wisdom saving throws.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: After which, Percy and Keyleth pretty much fall asleep at the table as it vanishes and they both collapse to the ground, eggs out of the corner of their mouth. Eventually they make themselves back up to sleep and the rest of you guys peter around for the remainder of the day while they get their full rest. It now comes to, at the end of that eight-hour period of time, I'd say about three, four in the afternoon before they finally wake up. You've restored your spells.
Marisha: Yay!
Matt: And the rest of you are ready to go about your business.
Laura: Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Liam: Wait! While they're sleeping, right--
Matt: Mm-hmm?
Liam: I take Scanlan aside.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oi.
Liam: Hey, buddy.
Sam: Hey, friendo.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: What's up?
Liam: We don't talk a lot.
Sam: Well, we start to and then you leave the room, usually. (laughter)
Liam: I don't handle personal emotional confrontation very well.
Sam: It's okay. I walk away. (laughter)
Marisha: Oh, shit!
Sam: Then I come back, I feel bad.
Taliesin: No, no, that was perfect.
Liam: Where did you go?
Sam: Just kidding, just kidding.
Liam: Pull up a chair, sit down, I want to ask you something.
Sam: I'm already as low as I can go.
Liam: You're right. How do you do it?
Sam: How do I do what?
Liam: How do you do it? You're risking your life as much as anyone in this group, you're almost dying every day. You're fucking smiling all the time. How do you do it? I'm kind of asking as Liam to Sam as well, but mostly as Vax to Scanlan. How do you do it? You almost died yesterday as well. Or two days ago, fuck. Why do you do it?
Sam: Well, Vax. I don't know, I mean, I like you people, okay? Everything before this was not as good. This is better. That's why. It's very simple. You had a shitty childhood, didn't you? You and the sister?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: I think Grog had some troubles. We've all had our share of shit before we all met. Now we're together, we're a family, this is better. That's how I smile. It's better than it was before. That's it.
Liam: We're probably going to die in the next month.
Sam: Yes, but it's fun while it lasts.
Liam: All right. Thought I might--
Sam: Glean some wisdom?
Liam: Yeah, but I'm just as confused as before.
Sam: Listen, I'm older than you.
Liam: How much older?
Sam: A bit. I've seen more than you have. And it's all shitty, so it just depends on how you look at it. You can dwell on the shit, or you can just leave it behind in people's beds and keep going.
Marisha: Oh god, that works on too many levels.
Taliesin: Oh god, that's too deep.
Marisha: Too deep.
Liam: You did that. Water under the bridge.
Sam: I walk away.
Liam: That little motherfucker shit in my bed.
Matt: All right. As you regather your will, path chosen; Keyleth, do you wish to prepare the transportation spell?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Let's do this.
Matt: All right. All of you gather and find your way down to the Sun Tree in the center of the town. At this point, it's later afternoon, you've been growing accustomed these past few days of taking action right around dusk, and as the sky turns from a blue to a bit of an orangish hue, you all find yourselves ready to transition back over to the continent of Issylra.
Marisha: Let's go. To the Sun Tree.
Matt: Keyleth steps forward, touches her hand to the Sun Tree, completes her mental incantation, and you watch the trunk once again tear open into the somewhat oval walkway into the tree itself. On the opposite side, what's your destination?
Marisha: Oh, god. As close as I can get to the Fire Ashari, I guess.
Matt: Okay. You recall, passing through, there were a number of trees towards the base of the mountain that were starting to grow petrified from the proximity to the ash that constantly falls from the sky. They died a long time ago and are slowly beginning to petrify. As the portal opens up on the opposite side, you can see beyond that the dark rock that formulates that mountain range. At the same time, you can see a dull orange glow, and you all begin to step through in rapid succession, Trinket racing up after Vex. All of you find yourself stepping out the other side, at which point you look up and you can see the pathway that you took towards the top of the mountain where the Fire Ashari called Pyrah, where they maintained their ever-vigilant watch on the tear into the fire elemental plane. What you do notice immediately is that the path that you took initially is no longer a simple walkway. Against the now very dark sky, this side of the realm itself, night is, actually, no, sorry. At this point, you've actually beaten the sun.
Marisha: Oh, do we gain a few hours?
Matt: Yeah, you guys have gained a few hours, technically.
Marisha: Awesome.
Matt: So it's still light in the sky from other parts in the distance, however, there is a perpetual dark cloud of smoke and actual storm cloud gathering across this mountain range. As you recall the first time you were here, that's the nature of Pyrah, it's always under this thick, heavy, soot-and-ash-filled cloud cover. The pathway that winds up the mountain, though, is instead a glowing orange mass of slowly dribbling molten rock that has filled that entire walkway, and it has come to rest at the base of the mountain where it has gathered and begun to cool. You guys are hundreds of feet off from this point as you step out of the tree. However, where you see the molten rock has reached the base of the mountain, you-- it's cooled and formed into solid rock at its base, and you start seeing flashes of the orange turning dark, then another section turns dark from the opposite side. And then a few moments pass and you can see the orange of the next section, up in like ten-foot segments, it's going dark and hardening on its own. You get the sense that your arrival did not trigger this more than it has been happening since before you arrived.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check to figure out what's up?
Matt: Sure. Actually, this would be a perception check to see if you can ascertain.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: 16. It's difficult to make out at this distance, but you can see, along portions of the jagged mountainside, a collection of small figures that are making their way up the mountain, and their slow ascent is met with the lava flow cooling in sections.
Marisha: Do they look like people, like humanoids?
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance, they look human-ish, humanoid-ish.
Taliesin: I attempt to use the optics on my gun to get a better look at them.
Matt: Sure, go ahead and make a perception check.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18. A little bit of a clearer look through, they do appear to be humanoid. You do see two arms, two legs. You can't gauge size comparison from this distance.
Sam: How far?
Matt: At this point, they're probably a good 800 feet up the mountain.
Marisha: 800 feet?
Taliesin: Are they dressed like the Ashari that I've met?
Matt: From what you can make out, their color palette shifts, there are reds and browns, some stand out as an aquamarine white. The Ashari you saw were a pretty consistent color palette. This is a little more varied.
Taliesin: I don't know who these people are.
Marisha: They could still be Ashari. Just in their elemental forms. Are there any birds around? I look up, do I see birds in the sky?
Matt: There are no birds in the sky. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this area, especially as the oppressive fumes and dust continue to pour off from the top of the caldera of this mountain range, it has made it not fitting for any sort of aerial life that you're used to seeing. You glance around for about a minute or two and you don't see any sort of bird life in the air.
Travis: Did the ground cool where they were walking? Could we follow them up?
Taliesin: We should.
Marisha: Let's stay far behind. Let's go quietly.
Laura: Let's walk. Stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: Okay. Everyone make a stealth check, including Trinket.
Travis: You don't want to put him in the thing?
Sam: You could.
Laura: (gasps) Okay.
Liam: Try it out.
Laura: I put it on a string so I could put it around my neck because it's a necklace because it's cooler that way.
Matt: Well, it has a chain on it that it came with.
Laura: It's got a chain on it, so it's around my neck.
Matt: All right, so you take it, you put--
Sam: It has a chain and a string now.
Matt: Chain and string.
Marisha: The string's so you don't forget.
Matt: Exactly. You trigger the necklace, pointing it in the direction of Trinket, and once again Trinket is absorbed into the crystal, vanishing within the inside. All right.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17.
Sam: Pass Without a Trace is--?
Travis: Plus ten. I rolled shitty.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 35.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 29.
Sam: 25.
Matt: Okay. You guys begin making your trek up. How are you going up the mountain? Are you scaling the cooled flow?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: That's probably the safest route given the fact that most of the other side of the mountain range itself is pretty jagged, and elements of it, because of the formation of this giant volcanic caldera, there are portions of broken stone and obsidian glass that sticks out the side.
Marisha: As we're walking up, I fall behind and I slip Vax the potion of fire protection.
Matt: All right. You guys continue in pace with this, eventually, and make another perception check?
Marisha: Much better, that's a natural 19. 30.
Matt: 30. Okay. Looking up, as this cluster of individuals makes their way towards the very top of the mountain, seemingly not taking sight of your traveling group, you're beginning to see the nature of each section of this flow cooling. And what you're seeing is the group will move up a bit, stop, and there appears to be a burst of-- sometimes it looks like very strong wind, sometimes it looks like a very localized sleet storm that is brought against the side of the mountain and is actually forcefully cooling the flow down temporarily, at least in those sections, before it begins to spill over and continue its slow molten descent, but they're doing their best to continue to force it back up the mountain and--
Laura: Those are druids.
Marisha: Those are druids.
Marisha: I cast Skywrite in the clouds above us, in the smoke.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I write--
Laura: "So, how are you guys doing up there?"
Taliesin: "Hi."
Marisha: "Hi. Hey you guys." I write, in druidic symbols, "Keyleth, Kaitiaki."
Sam: What's that? Is that her?
Matt: Okay. You notice the pace in which this group has ascended comes to a halt at the very, very top of the mountain range where it ends, and there's a slight pause before the clouds shift a second time and it says, from what you understand, "Kaitiaki. Survivors remain, Keyleth."
Marisha: And I respond with, "Help has arrived."
Sam: You guys are texting?
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah.
Matt: Druid texting.
Laura: What are you saying?
Taliesin: Stop looking at your phone.
Laura: What do they say?
Sam: Why don't we go over there and talk to them?
Marisha: They're survivors.
Travis: Well, let's go.
Laura: Are they nice?
Marisha: They're survivors. What does it matter?
Travis: And we go.
Marisha: Let's go. And I tell them, you know, "Arriving. Stand down. Here we come."
Taliesin: "Lol."
Marisha: "Lol. Winky-face."
Liam: As we travel, because I was too out of it to respond and she's way ahead, I take the potion that Keyleth gave to me, because she didn't have to, I've got the David Bowie armor on now.
Matt: You did don it. Okay.
Liam: Yes, yeah. Before going to bed.
Marisha: Oh you did, okay.
Liam: And I press it into Vex's hand.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hey, I took your, all right, I'm going to take it.
Matt: What was your choice of resistance? I assume it was fire. Okay. All right. As you guys progress up, and it is, though it is a safe route, it is still a relatively steep incline and you're all having to work together to find handholds, and it is very arduous physically getting up there. I would like everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Laura: A constitution?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Oh, do we get advantage because of the feast?
Travis: No, that's only wisdom.
Laura: Shit.
Liam: Come on, Colville meteorite die.
Travis: 17.
Liam: I'm so weak.
Laura: Come on, jade.
Liam: Natural 20!
Laura: You motherfucker!
Liam: Thank you, Matthew Colville.
Laura: I'm rolling my giant jade dice, because it's green.
Travis: Way to announce it.
Laura: Womp-womp. Oh, that's a six.
Travis: (laughs) You're fucked.
Marisha: 20.
Taliesin: 13.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Okay. As you guys begin to get partially up the mountain, the proximity of the heat from the-- because the exterior of the rock has cooled, but it's still molten beneath and there are parts of that are still cracking open, and bits of the heat are still pouring through, plus the general physical exertion from the not-very-hardy physiques of both Vex and Scanlan, you both suffer one level of exhaustion from the ascent up the side of this mountain.
Laura: Oh, Trinket's in his thing, he's not worried at all.
Taliesin: I don't actually know what one level of exhaustion is.
Matt: You guys have disadvantage on ability checks. All your skill checks right now, until your next long rest, are at disadvantage.
Travis: Levels of exhaustion suck.
Sam: Not saving.
Matt: However, as you guys are approaching towards the top, you can see now the humanoids that were at the top of this mountain crest have been since keeping the flow at bay and each time it begins to crest over again and continue its flow, it's blasted again from the side and cools and it's building this very, very slow gradual outcropping--
Marisha: I use my cantrip Gust and cool areas alongside as we ascend.
Matt: Okay. You glance up and you now have a better view of this group, and what you do see ahead of you, specifically Keyleth, appears to be a cluster of about eight or so Fire Ashari-dressed individuals. You can't make out their physical details yet. Along with five other entities that are dressed in the colors and vestments of those from Zephrah.
Marisha: Oh shit!
Travis: From who? From what?
Liam: What's the matter?
Laura: What's up? What's happening?
Marisha: I run up.
Matt: Keyleth goes running up.
Marisha: You said seven or eight from Zephrah?
Matt: There are five from Zephrah.
Laura: Are we going to, we're going to follow?
Liam: Yeah, I'm breaking out of stealth and running.
Taliesin: Ah. Yeah. No. We're running now.
Laura: I walk. I'm pretty tired. You and me. Let's just walk.
Sam: Yeah. You can carry me.
Taliesin: Cardio. God.
Matt: Okay, it takes a while to get up there. As you guys begin to approach, a little bit behind Keyleth, and you look, you see the only two notable Fire Ashari that you see there are Nastoen, which is a human female that you saw was one of the four that first greeted you as you approached Pyrah when you got to the mountaintop. She looks a little rough, but she's definitely in one piece. The other one that greets you, and immediately you recognize as Flamespeaker Cerkonos, who currently does not have his right arm. It is charred and is, through some semblance of flame, cauterized to where he no longer has a shoulder and part of his torso is a black mass of burnt skin, probably intentionally, but as you approach he puts his hand out and goes, "Hail, Keyleth."
Marisha: Hail, Cerkonos. And I run up and give him a hug.
Matt: He pats you on the back and there's a coldness to his look, his expression. You can see in a brief instant, though there is strength and determination, there is a moment as he looks into your face that you can see the sorrow of losing most of his people.
Marisha: And I look back at him and I say  I'm so sorry.
Matt: "This is not your fault. We had this coming. We are the able-bodied few you see."
Marisha: Are these all that have survived?
Matt: "We are 25 living. The rest reside at the base of the mountain, to be watched, or are the watchers. But our attrition is of our own making. We helped outsiders too long ago."
Marisha: What? What do you mean, like, how long ago? 12, 15 years?
Matt: "We helped seal a drake in this rift."
Laura: Thordak.
Matt: "That is the name they call him. We helped bring and bind the beast to this rift, sealing within it the heart of a primordial flame, one of the few pure essence crystals of our plane. Such a binding will not allow it to leave. It is a punishment for the most terrible of evils that the Ashari take under their order. We carved from the crystal in bind. This beast was too strong and took the entire crystal, but it seemed enough. It seemed enough."
Marisha: Cerkonos, it's not your fault. There are greater forces at work here, beyond us. That's something that I am desperately trying to reassure myself of every day.
Matt: And a voice comes up from over the mountain range, raspy, older, and with a casual importance to it, and it says, "So, are you claiming some semblance of dealing with this?" And as it steps over, the face looks down with recognition. "My god. Keyleth."
Marisha: Who are you?
Matt: You guys look up and you see long, silver-haired half-elf in later years dressed in the blue and white robes of the Air Ashari. You see before you Korren, your father. "You live."
Marisha: Dad!
Matt: He steps forward and goes in, as he steps away from Cerkonos, takes you in his arms and holds you extremely tight against him.
Marisha: I'm sorry I didn't check in sooner. I didn't want you to be disappointed.
Matt: "Shh." He puts his finger up to your lips, holds you back and looks you over and with a smile on his face, you can see the hardness of his expression fade. "Keyleth, you've grown."
Marisha: A lot's happened.
Matt: "You look just like her."
Marisha: I haven't found Mom.
Matt: "Her path was her own. I'm just glad that you have maintained yours." He wipes the tear from your face and says, "How goes the Aramente?"
Marisha: Well.
Laura: She's kicking ass.
Matt: "Good. Good." And he places his thumb at the corner of his eye. "We were called naught but a day ago by the surviving Pyrah. Told of the angry mountain and the terrible drake that sundered the rift. I helmed the team while the majority of our people stayed to keep Zephrah cloaked and safe from the marauding beast. We've only just made our way up the mountain. Your arrival is quite fortuitous, as we need all the help we can get."
Sam: How can we be of assistance?
Matt: "Come. See what remains of Pyrah." He turns around and walks back over towards the top of the mountain.
Marisha: Daddy.
Matt: He stops. Looks over his shoulder towards you. "Yes?"
Marisha: It's good to see you again, father.
Matt: "It's good to see you as well, daughter. Now come. Show me what you've learned." Goes back to walking. The rest of the Fire Ashari stand up, acknowledge and recognize those of you that stand here before, visiting once before. Cerkonos looks about. "You show strength and honor by coming here in our time of need. This will not be forgotten. Now come." As you follow them up over the top of the mountain, you see once again before you the caldera of this once-volcanic mountain has been blown apart in areas. You can see sections of large black stone that are now pushed up into jagged obelisks where once was a relatively smooth blackened shale countryside. You can see there are pits of molten rock that have been punched through the floor and have gathered into these pools where the air above is slowly shifting and warped by the heat that is now released above the mountaintop. The flow of lava that descends down the side of this mountain continues and swells and heads inward towards the Cindergrove. The Cindergrove, from what you can see from this distance, is but a fraction of what was once there, most of the trees now torn apart and scattered amongst the top of this mountain. You can see bits and pieces of the various petrified trees thrown hundreds of feet from the center. There are still standing, defiant trees amongst what once was the Cindergrove, but they are very sparse, many of them now blackened by what you can see in the very distance beyond the broken huts and homes that once held the Pyrah, you can see in the distance moving, glowing dots of various elemental energies spiraling outward from a very large central red rift that sits there pulsing and pulsing with bright, almost sunlight energy. It's like staring into the sun at the very zenith of its movement. You have to avert your eyes even staring towards this rift, now a good 30, 40 feet taller than it was when you last returned here. What was once the portal in the ground has now ruptured and is emerging, slowly piercing out of the top of this mountain. Undaunted, your father and the other Ashari continue walking forward with no words.
Laura: I rush forward a little bit to talk to him. Question. Your majesty? I want to help, we all want to help as much as possible, but I don't know any magic. Most of us don't. Are we going to be able to do anything?
Matt: "Well, I certainly hope so. If you've survived this long with my daughter, you've picked up a few tricks."
Laura: Well, that I have.
Marisha: Father, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for these people. They are the most capable that I know.
Matt: "This is good. Because that's who we need right now."
Marisha: However, since we're druids, we're a little bit more, you know. Geared. Prepared to deal with the fire. I can cast Protection from Energy on a couple of these people, if you wouldn't mind maybe grabbing the other two?
Matt: "I will do what I can."
Marisha: And I cast Protection from Fire on Percy, you have it, you have it, do you have it?
Travis: Well, I really don't even know what I'm going to do here.
Marisha: Well, it's going to protect you from fire.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: Scanlan?
Sam: Hit me, babe.
Marisha: I'll do Percy and Scanlan. Father, can you--?
Matt: It's a concentration spell, so you can only really have one person going, and that's your concentration.
Marisha: Can only have one person going.
Matt: Yep.
Travis: Well, good.
Marisha: I could cast it at higher levels. Can I cast it at higher levels?
Travis: I'll take a mulligan on this one.
Marisha: Can't do that with this one? Fuck.
Laura: Do Scanlan. Do Scanlan.
Sam: No, I'm fine, don't worry about me.
Marisha: Well, I'm going to cast it on myself, for starters. Because I want it.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: So I'm going to cast Protection from Fire on myself.
Laura: What does a potion of fire resistance do?
Liam: Halves.
Laura: The same thing?
Laura: Halves all fire damage?
Marisha: Halves all fire damage?
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right. As the cluster of you begin stepping deeper into the caldera, you begin to approach the outskirts of the remnants of the Pyrah tribe's homestead. You can see where most of it has been either completely burnt to a cinder or lies tattered by some great force, shattered. And you start, as you're walking through, you can see where the landscape itself, all the jagged bits of black obsidian glass are shooting up out of the ground and there's broken pieces of the dark rock and volcanic material, and it isn't until your eyes begin to focus that you realize that elements of this rock is not rock at all but the twisted and charred remains of the Pyrah that didn't escape in time, blending in with the ground and landscape surrounding. The rest of the Ashari continue pushing forward, not taking notice, focused, as before you, you can see the rift, still blinking ever-bright, in the center of the remains of the Cindergrove. You steel yourselves.
Marisha: I turn and I look at them and nod and follow in my people's footsteps.
Matt: And that's where we'll end tonight's session.
Travis: Oh shit.
Laura: Oh shit.
Travis: Okay. We're cooking with gas now.
Laura: As Marisha collapses in a pool of tears.
Taliesin: Cry more, cry more!
Matt: You knew this was coming.
Laura: Yeah, man. You're going to have a headache tomorrow, dude.
Marisha: I'm so tired. I'm tired.
Laura: Aw, we've got exhaustion, Sam. That's balls.
Sam: Yeah, that's not great.
Liam: Thanks for tuning in to Therapy Thursday, everyone.
Travis: Where we take shits and talk to swords.
Laura: There you go.
Matt: Got a little bit of column A, little bit of column B, we got some drama, we got some personal issues, we got some reunions, we got some hardships, we got--
Taliesin: Wild animals.
Laura: Yeah, so many things!
Matt: And a travel method for Trinket.
Laura: Oh my god, I'm so excited about it!
Matt: I wasn't sure how you guys were going to use that one, as soon as you mentioned it I was like, all right, that's what they're doing. That's a way to do it. Yeah. Well cool, guys, we'll be back next week Thursday with Chris Hardwick, who will be joining us as a guest.
Laura: Yay!
Marisha: How is he going to be here?
Taliesin: As himself. He's going to be playing himself, it's going to be very exciting.
Travis: Guys, I'm a human. Usually.
Liam: I'm super busy, I'm super busy.
Taliesin: Out of the rift suddenly comes Chris Hardwick.
Marisha: Super busy, but I'm super successful.
Liam: I'll help save the world, but I got like 50 things on my schedule.
Matt: Yeah, so we'll be back then. I think April 21st is going to be our 50th episode. We're going to be doing a fun little evening there. We'll have Critmas coming up, probably end up being that night, maybe another night that week, we'll have details coming up soon, we're trying to figure out the schedule on that. This'll be our big 50th anniversary Critmas blowout, and then we're going to scale it back to like an annual-type event it looks like, both to save the people who work this channel Thursday nights and stay super later to get here, to save the length of the episodes, and to help all of us who have to then go to work sometimes very early the next morning.
Liam: We love you, but I need to sleep. It's as simple as that. We love you, and we love Critmas, but it's a health thing.
Matt: So what we'll be doing is this will be our big blowout Critmas, we'll still do it probably for the holidays, and we really implore you guys to give to charities, send us stuff, we still read them, we'll still do Periscopes, those of us who get gifts, some of us will open them on Periscope for you, so we'll still have the interaction, we'll have to do it on our own time and not at 11, midnight.
Travis: 12, 12 30.
Liam: 12 37.
Taliesin: On a 7AM call.
Matt: So this'll be our big general blowout. So if you're planning something for the next Critmas, this'll be the one to get it in for. But yeah, you can check out the guide to Critmas on Geek & Sundry, it has a list of all our supported charities if you want to give there. It's highly recommended. Thank you guys so much for those who donated to 826 tonight so we can go ahead and help out the Seattle branch.
Marisha: 826 Seattle! We love you.
Matt: And yeah. Do we have anything else?
All: Happy St. Patty's Day.
Laura: You guys are hopefully sitting at home being very good.
Liam: For fuck's sake, take an Uber.
Matt: All right, guys. Well, have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Bye!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors get together and play Dungeons & Dragons. Tonight, apologies for the slight technical issues, but we're back and we're going to be playing through tonight's adventure. Before that gets started, let's go ahead and get through a couple of quick announcements. First and foremost, it's our third week of our Loot Crate sponsorship. Thank you very much. (cheering)
Matt: Thank you for your interest in our show and our audience, so for those of you who are interested, Loot Crate is a really cool service where once a month they bring you themed boxes that have mystery contents within that are part of that theme. All generally pop culture and geek-centric.
Laura: Taliesin, you're so loud!
Matt: Taliesin, quiet!
Sam: Shut up, Taliesin. Jesus. (laughter)
Travis: Stop masturbating during the announcements.
Laura: It's so loud. What are you doing?
Taliesin: I think I hit my microphone.
Sam: Don't worry. You're not an audio professional.
Matt: That's okay. At least it wasn't during a very climactic and important emotional moment in the game.
Travis: (laughing) Yeah, that's right.
Ashley: You're welcome!
Matt: (laughs) Anyway, yeah. Loot Crate's awesome. We've gone with it for years. They send mystery items that are all geek and pop culture-related. They're a lot of fun, and if you go to their website at www.LootCrate.com/criticalrole and check it out. If you like it and you get a subscription, you can use criticalrole-- one word-- as a promo code to get $3 off a subscription.
Sam: I'm wearing some of the stuff from the crate right now.
Travis: And they've got a power crate coming out.
Laura: David Bowie! Labyrinth!
Travis: They have an Infinity Gauntlet oven mitt.
Marisha: That's pretty dope.
Laura: Is that giving something away? I feel like we gave spoilers.
Liam: It was already Periscoped.
Laura: Oh, that's true. Never mind.
Matt: That would be nice in the box. We're good? We didn't waste it?
Liam: What's in the box?
Ashley: (singing) A dick in a box.
Matt: I hope there is no dick in a box as part of this service. Or perhaps I guess you do, depending on-- that's a whole different box service.
Marisha: If there is, you should call your local post office. (laughter)
Matt: That's a love box membership. Anyway, so! Also, once again, I want to remind everyone, we are happily carrying along the torch of 826LA, a fantastic charity that's been with us from the very beginning. 826 is a wonderful charity that promotes creative writing skills and literacy in mostly underprivileged kids at a young age, at which they normally don't have access to tutoring and people to help them on that direction, so if you can and have the opportunity and you're feeling like giving to some awesome people out there, 826LA, and 826 in general in your area, is a great charity to take a look at, so please. You guys have been a tremendous help in the past and you may continue to be so, if you wish.
Travis: Absolutely.
Matt: Good times. Let's see. Taliesin is joining us from Hawaii. Where are you at, Taliesin?
Taliesin: Where am I right now? I'm in my hotel room. Somewhere-- which island are we on? Oahu. We're on Oahu. For Amazing Comic-Con.
Matt: If you're on Oahu and you're watching this, you should go say hi to him. Not right now, but tomorrow and Sunday. And the rest of the great folks that are out there with you. All good people. Big old Street Fighter troupe. Also, we have Travis and his nose goblin and Laura, you guys are attending Puerto Rico Comic-Con?
Laura: Yeah! We leave early tomorrow morning.
Liam: Ah, you can sleep on the plane.
Laura: Good times.
Travis: Yeah! If you're in Puerto Rico, come see us. We'll be there, totally sleep-deprived and bushy-tailed.
Liam: It's a good one, though.
Travis: It's a good one?
Liam: Yeah, I went to that one.
Travis: We're excited to go. San Juan, baby. San Juan!
Matt: That's pretty slick, actually.
Marisha: That's awesome.
Matt: Does anybody else-- you said you wanted to mention something?
Liam: Yeah, Sam Riegel and I are both in Fallout Far Harbor, which is the first big DLC story dump. "Fah Hahbah." Fallout is my favorite way to escape reality second to this, so I hope you come join me. I play a human guy, but there's also a synth. Look for the synth.
Sam: I think I play a synth. And there you go.
Liam: There you go. That's it.
Sam: Good plug.
Marisha: You can also build a Taliesin robot, which I did, and named it the Taliesin 2000.
Laura: Aw, that's awesome!
Matt: So you could take either a custom-build Taliesin or me as your companion to Far Harbor and talk to these shmucks. And have a full Critical Role after-the-apocalypse experience. That's awesome. Okay, we're actually going to be downloading that soon. Anyone else have anything they want to mention before we jump into the game tonight?
Travis: Let's do this.
Marisha: I don't want to die.
Matt: Let's go ahead and get this started, as we dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role!
Sam: Nothing's happening.
Matt: No intro.
Sam: Nothing's happening. (laughter)
Sam: Wait! Let's act it out.
Matt: Act out the intro?
Marisha: Okay! (imitating music)
Travis: (growls)
Marisha: (swishing sound effects)
Sam: Taliesin, do something!
Liam: Shoot from your screen!
Laura: Shoot, you're shooting your gun! Be Percy!
Liam: Then you got hit by a wang!
Laura: Oh, you fall over!
Matt: Well done Taliesin, that was great. Ashley picks him up.
Laura: She's healing him.
Ashley: I'll hold your hand! Eyes closed, holding my holy symbol!
Matt: And it got weird.
Ashley: Had to add it.
Matt: And now it swings--
Liam: Oh, Laura Bailey standing in for an orc! (stabbing sound) Ugh, gah! Now be yourself oh!
Laura: Pew pew!
Liam: And I'll go oh!
Laura: And then I'll go oh! Then I wink at you.
Travis: This was not the plan, for the love of god help us!
Laura: And then I shoot another one at you! [actual intro plays]
Matt: Welcome back to this majestic clusterfuck that is tonight. (laughter)
Matt: As open beta leaves its red and raw path, we rebuild! We stand up against the swaggering might of the new programming, and we stand tall for tonight's episode of Critical Role. Previously, Vox Machina, the band of adventurers walking through Tal'Dorei post-attack of the Chroma Conclave, an evil troupe of chromatic dragons that are currently holding power in this region and beyond, after tearing through many of the bastions of society in this countryside. They have gone on a quest to search for artifacts known as the Vestiges of Divergence, from ancient wars and heroes of old and yore, to use against the leader of the Chroma Conclave, Thordak the Cinder King. Now as part of this confrontation, they made their way to the city of Westruun, which was partially destroyed by the black dragon, Umbrasyl. While it was off and away with the rest of the Conclave, was then conquered by the wandering Herd of Storms that Grog once belonged to. After finding it occupied by these rather brutal barbaric individuals, Vox Machina set into the city, destroyed and tore down their leader Kevdak, to much fanfare from Grog's past. And through Kevdak's son and Grog's majestic might they decided to take the remainder of the Herd of Storms and take out Umbrasyl, the great black dragon. Half the Herd didn't like that and has decided to leave to their own devices, where the rest of the party possibly prepares to plot and plan a way to kill an ancient black dragon.
Travis: I don't like the way he said that. Why'd you have to say it like that? It's just a black dragon!
Matt: What else am I going to say?
Liam: Why the dramatic pauses?
Matt: Because it's fun.
Travis: You used the word 'somehow'.
Matt: I like it. You guys, having just finished this stroke of a conversation with Zanror in the Margrave's homestead, the dawn light is now beginning to pour over the mountain range in the distance. The day has officially begun. Zanror has stepped out and has begun to speak with a few of his trusted Herd members to stand down for the day, letting people know that the battle has been postponed for the time being while a plan is to be enacted, prepared for, and then sprung the following day. The rest of you guys have this day to prepare however you see fit. So I ask you: what would you like to do?
Sam: We have so many things that we need to do!
Matt: Where do we begin?
Sam: We need supplies. We need to parlay with our allies. We need lots of chains.
Laura: We need to trap the dragon obviously on the ground.
Sam: For that we'll need some bindings of some sort: chains, hooks, spikes.
Taliesin: I have a thought, I have a thought in that direction. When we're ready, I was thinking of basically building what is essentially a giant pressurized mousetrap.
Laura: Is there, how would you do that?
Liam: How much time do you need, Perce?
Taliesin: Do I have access to some people to help build it, and some perhaps broken homes and chunks of wood and chain?
Matt: You do have access to broken homes, chain, and scraps at your disposal. As far as individuals that can aid you, you have individuals that can help hold things for you. The Herd of Storms is not known for its ingenious use of tinkering tools, but--
Laura: What about blacksmiths in town? Are there any blacksmiths left?
Matt: You can check around.
Taliesin: This would be a blacksmith just to make a couple springs. This is not a complicated-- This is literally something you could make in the woods. It's a slightly more complex version of something you could make in the woods to catch birds. I'm just building a really big version. It's a whole bunch of systems like this that will have chains and weights on them that when you disrupt the weight at the center the whole thing goes clunk, throws a whole bunch of-- it's basically a netting system. It's an entanglement and will be an entanglement.
Matt: Okay. I'll tell you what. Go ahead and roll an investigation check, Percy, if you don't mind.
Laura: Can we help him at all?
Matt: Yeah, I'll say if you want to go ahead and aid to that, take advantage on that, Percy.
Taliesin: Thank god. Yeah, no, not very good.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a six.
Laura: With advantage?
Matt: With advantage?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: So! After taking the better part of about three hours scouring the town, most of the remaining villagers--
Laura: He took three hours doing that?!
Matt: Three hours, so, from what he's doing with the aid of people that aided him, which would be Vex asking about, the few folks that have any experience with any sort of blacksmithy are the folks that make horseshoes, and that's the extent of the complication they can create. So they can attempt to, with your aid, craft some springs. They have the materials to do very basic metalwork and ironwork, but the people you encounter, two folks in particular, they're both a little confused by your overall design and are waiting for you to lead them in a specific direction.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm just going to take them and I'm going to start building one and see if they can follow suit then. Three springs will be more than enough for this design.
Matt: How big a spring?
Taliesin: I would say, how tall is this dragon?
Matt: Roughly 30 to 40 feet, depending.
Taliesin: About a two-to-three-foot spring, then. Three two-to-three-foot springs made of solid iron. Just enough to lift the system and toss. And it's just, you make them like chainmail. It's a process that exists. I'm not going nuts.
Matt: I'm not saying you're going nuts. You are a little stretched for supplies and manpower based on the circumstances in Westruun for a complicated task, but it's fairly possible, but it will pretty much take the entirety of your day and most of your night to prepare this. You'll be able to squeeze by with this, with the construction of the device, and have maybe just enough room for-- I'll let you squeeze in a long rest.
Taliesin: That'll be perfect.
Matt: But that's success or fail.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Matt: Okay. What are the rest of you guys planning?
Liam: Three hours ago, back when we were still together, I pulled Scanlan aside. Listen, I want to talk to you. I have an idea.
Sam: Is this about Kaylie? Because I'm still worried about her. But I don't think that we should discuss her right now. We have other things! Why are you harping on this? She's my daughter. (laughter)
Sam: Just give it a rest.
Liam: You're right, I should have never dragged you down into the sewers, and I apologize. It won't happen again. But listen to me. I have an idea. It's a dangerous idea, and I don't want to lead with it. I don't want to fight this dragon, to be honest, but I think the group is going that direction. If we do-- Percival's run off to try something, maybe we're just going to run out. I have an idea that only you can do.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: We have a rod.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Not the cube. A rod that cannot be moved.
Sam: We could use it in some way.
Liam: You can teleport, and I'm almost too afraid to even suggest it, but if shit goes south, how would you feel about teleporting inside of Umbrasyl's stomach? With that rod.
Sam: Well, what has he eaten? Because it could be nasty in there!
Liam: I assume it will. I don't know anatomy. I haven't talked to my sister about this. She might be able to give us input, and I don't want to lead with this. I don't want you to do it because I feel like you could melt in there.
Sam: Of course I could melt in there! I'm a little man and he's got acid on him!
Liam: I know. I'm looking for a way through this fucking clusterfuck and if there's nothing else to do, you could go in there and click that rod and give him the worst suppository ever invented!
Sam: Listen. If there's a man invented who can go to where shit is made and make some really good shit, that's me. So let's pursue this. As a plan B.
Liam: As a plan B. And I take him by the shoulders. You remember that little talk we had about a week ago, when you told--
Sam: Is this about Kaylie again?
Liam: No, we can talk about Kaylie in a couple of days, all right?
Sam: Okay.
Liam: When you told me how things were better now? Okay, you remember that?
Sam: Yes.
Liam: That was fucking insane. They are not better. Everything is terrible! Our lives are terrible. They are way worse than they were six months ago, way worse. I was with all of you assholes a year ago, and two years ago, they're way worse.
Sam: You're saying that, a sullen loner who is confiding in one of his closest friends while holding him on the shoulders. This you never had before.
Liam: I slap him on the cheek a little bit and say: you are a fucking madman, but I am glad you're here.
Sam: I'm glad to be with you.
Liam: And I love you. And I give him a playful slap across the face.
Sam: Six points of damage. (laughter)
Matt: Unexpected, sneak attack. 7d6 points of damage.
Sam: All right, so I'm going to go talk to Vex. An expert in dragons I hope?
Laura: I'm an expert on dragons.
Sam: And ask her how dragons work, how their bodies work.
Laura: What do you mean?
Sam: Where they're vulnerable, where they make the acid, where they have lungs, where they have stomachs, how many stomachs? Are they like a cow with eight stomachs or something?
Matt: Go ahead and make an intelligence check with advantage.
Travis: Cows have eight stomachs?
Marisha: They've got like two or three.
Laura: Shut up! 17.
Matt: 17. Yeah, dragons have the pieces you imagine they would have in the right vicinity. Their stomach is quite acidic, as it has been known to dissolve some of the hardiest of creatures, let alone break down some basic minerals and materials. So it's not a happy place to be, but it's not like instantaneous dissolution. It will hurt. Also know that the breath weapon, the acid that a black dragon, which uses acid as a breath weapon in a stream in front of it, much like your lightning bolt, does not come from its stomach. That acid is much more toxic, concentrated, and comes from a separate part of its body, a gland, a breathing mechanism that projects it outward.
Laura: Where's the gland located? Would I know that, like, in his throat?
Matt: It's somewhere in this vicinity, you're not entirely certain.
Sam: So if I miss, end up in that gland, that would be not good.
Matt: That would be really bad.
Liam: Don't roll a one!
Ashley: But that would probably be really hard to just get right into that spot.
Liam: But you know, you wouldn't suffer.
Laura: It would be instantaneous, at least.
Sam: Also. Vex. Vex'ahlia.
Laura: Oh. Getting fancy now, Scanlan Shorthalt.
Sam: Thank you. Your brother tells me that you have some sort of acid-resistant something.
Laura: The armor? That I took from him?
Liam: Yes, my armor. She has it.
Laura: Well-- are you here? Are you next-- are you next to me now?
Liam: No, I'm about five feet behind you rolling my eyes and doing this the whole time you're talking about dragons.
Laura: It's the armor that I won fair and square from him! Yes, I am wearing it right now.
Sam: Is that your primary armor?
Laura: It is.
Sam: How would you feel about me asking you to take it off? Doing a little unbuckling and giving it to me instead?
Laura: Scanlan, that's going to cost you a lot of money.
Sam: We could swap armor.
Laura: You think your little armor will fit me.
Sam: I have a pretty broad chest. These are pecs.
Laura: What kind of armor do you have?
Sam: I have cold snap leather armor.
Laura: Which is cold resistant?
Sam: Cold resistant. Maybe the dragon will throw snowballs at you.
Laura: I doubt that. What is it, is it plus two?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Plus two on top of the armor, so it's four.
Matt: So it's armor plus two.
Liam: It's better overall.
Laura: Okay. Well sweet, then yeah, sure, give it to me.
Sam: Can we do that?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Strip on down there, Scanlan.
Sam: Well, ladies first!
Laura: No, you first, I want to see the cube and then I'll give you my armor.
Sam: Shall we make it interesting and play a little poker?
Laura: There's no time for that.
Sam: All right. I very slowly and sultrily unbuckle my armor, let one strap fall, let the other strap fall, just do a little shimmy and let it fall to the ground, sort of like The Crying Game. Just sort of, camera pans up a little bit and it's just, there's nothing underneath, it's just me and the cube. And I cry a little. (laughter)
Liam: During which I pick up Scanlan's shawm and start playing it terribly. No idea what I'm doing. Do you blow into this, are there strings? I don't know.
Laura: I try really hard not to start laughing.
Sam: Go with what your body tells you to do. How are you going to take off your armor?
Laura: That's a good question. Do you want to walk away for this?
Liam: Yeah, I leave the room.
Laura: I completely ungracefully take it off and throw it at you. Give me that armor. How is this going to fit me? I'm just naked trying to squirm into these extra-skinny jeans.
Matt: Actually, as you pull the armor pieces up, they shift and formfit to your size as part of their enchantment.
Laura: What color is it? Is it beautiful?
Matt: The cold snap armor is I believe dark browns with traces of white and silver along the edges as a cold winter motif as part of the enchantment.
Laura: Does it match my storm bow?
Matt: Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Laura: You might not be getting this back, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, really? Well. What does mine look like?
Matt: For a moment, it looks pretty haphazard and hanging off of you.
Sam: Oh, these are like C-cups up here. (laughter)
Matt: As the armor slowly retracts and finds itself to your form.
Sam: Oh! They went down.
Matt: In that moment, Scanlan learned a lot about himself.
Sam: All right. I feel good about this. Now we'll continue our dragon lesson I suppose.
Laura: Wait, why did you need to change-- are you going to be up close and personal with him?
Sam: Well, I think we all are, you know. He breathes acid.
Laura: Well yes, but.
Sam: Yeah, so we could get hit! Now I'm more protected than you are!
Laura: This was a really stupid-- why did I give that up?
Sam: I'm very charming.
Laura: Now you're not here?
Liam: You told me to leave! You took off your clothes. I'm Liam, I'm not Vax, what're you talking about?
Laura: Are you planning on doing something?
Sam: We're all planning on doing something, and I don't think that my part of the plan is any stupider than yours will be. So. Good luck to you. I'll keep your armor safe. Hopefully we can trade back. And if not, you can peel it off my dead body.
Laura: As long as you're not melted from all the acid.
Ashley: I'd like to attune to my frostbrand sword.
Matt: Okay, so you'll be putting aside the mace of disruption and taking on the frostband instead. Okay. Cool.
Liam: Oh, shit, I go running after Percival. I'm going to go find Percival.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah. Well. Does that take an hour, or do I catch up with him pretty quick?
Matt: You would know the direction he went, and thankfully in the awkward still-quiet that is the center of the town now that it's missing most of its populace, and those that are there are acknowledging the tension of what might be coming, and many of them are now packing up and leaving and getting out of the town, evacuating when they've been notified of the possible coming battle. The sound of metal clangs in the distance, and the gathering of materials from some of the rubble is not too difficult to discern over time. Takes you about half an hour or so to locate him.
Liam: Oh, there's that white hair. Percival!
Taliesin: Yes? Hello. Bit busy. What?
Liam: Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't want to take up a lot of your time. I reckon you're going to be busy with this all day, yeah?
Taliesin: Oh yes. This is quite a project.
Liam: Ah, and also tomorrow. You're probably going to be taking potshots at that thing, yeah?
Taliesin: Ah, that's my hope is to be, honestly, as far away from this as humanly possible.
Liam: That's probably not my plan. Can I have use of your blade?
Taliesin: Oh! The dragonslayer longsword, yes, of course, of course. I pull it off my belt and hand it off. Could help. I'm a little terrified that you're getting that close to it, but here it is.
Liam: It's just in case.
Taliesin: It's quite a piece.
Liam: Good luck today.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: Good luck tomorrow.
Taliesin: I am down to my normal sword now.
Laura: Can I be talking to Zanror?
Marisha: I'll join you in that. That was my next plan.
Matt: The two of you eventually find Zanror. Zanror and Warra are in the process of piling weapons and armor with the rest of the Herd into the center of the town where the battle outside of the Margrave's house happened. Most of the warriors there are in the process of steeling themselves, some of them are gathering their materials, some are in the process of doing some minor ritualistic scarring in preparation for the battle. There is very little conversation happening. It seems like there is this quiet understanding that this, for many, might be their last day. They're making peace with the coming glory of battle. You'd expect this sense of tense fear, this very Battle of Helm's Deep-type acceptance of doom, but this is a different personality amongst the Herd here. There is almost a brimming excitement with the idea of possible glory or at least a glorious end. And it very much befits the story that you've heard of Grog's past history, and very easy to see where he once came from.
Laura: I bring Zanror a big tankard of ale and sit down in front of him. MATT "Oh, good to see you."
Marisha: I stand behind Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "This for me?"
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Looks to Worra.
Marisha: Don't worry, we wouldn't try to poison you the night before a dragon-fight.
Matt: (laughs) "That would be rather stupid, wouldn't it?"
Marisha: It would.
Matt: And he just downs it all in one big chug. "Thanks."
Laura: Zanror? Did I hear you correctly before, that you have been the one speaking with the beast in the past?
Matt: "I have, aye."
Laura: So when it comes and gathers its treasure, it stops and talks, or does it just come and take it and leave?
Matt: "It has at times. More at the beginning. If it had questions and seemed curious. That wore off after the first few times. Now it just seems to come and take and find its way out."
Laura: So if the treasure looked different this time, it might stop and talk about it?
Matt: He stops for a second. "Maybe."
Laura: I'm curious because I know you said you are lacking in gold and treasure. What will entice the beast?
Matt: "Hm. Beyond that, I don't really know. That's what is forcing our hand right now."
Laura: What if we had a way of providing some gold? And maybe you provide an offering of a different kind? What if you say that your father Kevdak had been plotting against the dragon and you found out about it. Would you be able to offer his body and the body of his allies as tribute to the dragon?
Matt: "Huh."
Laura: Dragons are vain.
Matt: And you do know specifically white dragons, or sorry, black dragons, they're very cruel by nature. They actually enjoy messing with creatures they see below them, especially intended prey, torturing for extended periods of time before killing. They aren't comparatively as vain as other dragons per se, but all chromatics fall in some way shape or form on that same scale of self-love to the point of being a near-disease to many of them. Zanror thinks to himself for a second and goes, "We can certainly try. I mean, I've got no more use for it, though it's going to be hard to convince it without a head. I'm pretty sure Grog took that with him."
Laura: Well, we may be able to get that back. How are you planning on hiding your fellow warriors from the dragon so as not to attract its attention? Because we may have some ideas.
Matt: "We'll have to share ideas. Ours was to go ahead and plod up Gatshadow. Usually it's about noon when it comes down for the offering. We leave it what little we have left, possibly lose two men in the process of delivering it, and then when it returned to its place we'd be there waiting to ambush it once it returned, use that time when it was gone to go ahead and hole up inside its home."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "That was our intent."
Marisha: We might be able to do one better.
Laura: A dragon's lair is not--
Marisha: Especially a black dragon's lair.
Laura: We wouldn't do much damage to it there, in fact, it's probably laid several traps against us already.
Matt: "Well, there's not much we can really do when we're all fighting with our fucking axes and swords, can we? In the lair at least it's stuck on the ground."
Laura: What if we could trap it onto the ground here?
Matt: "How do you intend to do that?"
Laura: We have a wonderful tinkerer. Quite talented. And he's creating something to trap the dragon.
Matt: "Really."
Laura: Plus we can provide several chains. Once it's on the ground, maybe your very strong goliaths could try to snare it, grappling-hook it, throw some chains up and over?
Marisha: This pile of weapons you have here, I see a decent amount of javelins. A rudimentary harpoon, in the hands of some of your strongest, could help wrangle him down.
Matt: He stops for a second and goes, "I just want to be clear we don't underestimate the sheer size, strength, and ferocity of this beast. With all 20 men, we might be able to hold it down, I don't know how long. I hope that contraption your friend is making is strong enough to aid us that last little bit, because I get the feeling that if our might is put to just keeping it on the ground-- well, that's a lot less of our strengths that we could be tending to. A lot less blades we could put into its hide."
Laura: Well, hopefully it would only be needed for a small amount of time before our magic users have their way with it.
Marisha: About that time I light up my hands.
Matt: "That's impressive. You know what else is impressive? Watching four of my friends melt in a matter of seconds."
Marisha: That is very impressive. You're not wrong.
Matt: "I just want to instill with you an understanding not to be brash, not to go ahead and run into this unless you're absolutely certain. Now. I've got chains, you've got chains. We've got strong men. If we put ourselves intent on just holding this beast down, I have the feeling, even with our weight behind it, it's going to be a difficult attempt. Do we have any other way of anchoring it down, something else we can put the chains to?"
Marisha: About that time I walk over to the-- is there a stone wall in here?
Matt: I mean, there are pieces of stone building in the vicinity.
Marisha: I put my hand against the stone and I cast Transmute Rock and I push my hand into the stone as it turns to mud.
Laura: And now turn it back, Keyleth.
Marisha: I take a spear that's on the floor, stick it in, and then turn it back.
Matt: All right. Let me look this up real fast.
Marisha: See? Magic. (laughter)
Marisha: Put my hand underneath the spear. Put my hand over the spear.
Laura: Ah? Ah? No strings!
Marisha: Where is it, where is it?
Matt: Yeah, mud to rock, yeah. Lasts for-- it's instantaneous. So when he looks at that, he goes, "So. What you're saying is if we can find a few places in which the rock is close to the surface, you could lock these chains in?"
Marisha: I think I could lock the whole dragon in.
Laura: Once it's on the ground, if we can pull it down enough, she may be able to lock its legs into the stone.
Marisha: Beyond that, if that fails-- And then I cast, for right now I'll just do Wall of Stone, I'm just burning through all my spells as a demonstration. And I bring up two pillows. Two pillows?
Ashley: And then we all lay down and go to sleep!
Sam: Pillow fight! (laughter)
Liam: Billy Mays here for the Ashari Tribe!
Matt: "Goose down. Unexpected tactic."
Laura: I like how we're walking through all of these ideas and none of it's going to work when we get there.
Marisha: I blast up two pillars, right next to Kevdak.
Matt: Not next to Kevdak. You mean Zanror?
Marisha: Sorry, sorry. Sorry, the other big goliath leader.
Sam: Whatever your name is.
Matt: That one, ohmygod.
Marisha: And trap him in.
Matt: Okay, you (rumbles). Warra's pushed to the side as the stone shoots up.
Marisha: (whispers) Sorry, Warra, sorry. So-- I know! Did not mean to lay a hand.
Matt: "All right, your point is made. We've got two others who can do similar magic as you, maybe not the same level, but--"
Marisha: Fantastic.
Matt: "Want us to put them at your aid?"
Marisha: That would be wonderful. Beyond that, in prep, I can dig a trench, hidden underground around our trap, so that whenever we're ready, your army can bust out of the ground.
Laura: Surprise.
Marisha: Without being seen.
Matt: "Without being seen, what, are we going to bury my men?"
Laura: Very lightly.
Marisha: Pretty much. To be fair, I actually did it on a trap to kill like eight of your men on the way in and it worked phenomenally. So you should trust me.
Laura: It was pretty great.
Marisha: It worked well.
Matt: "I think we'll take our chances above ground, please."
Laura: The only thing I'm worried about, Zanror, is that if this ugly beast flies in and sees, oh, how many of your men do you have?
Matt: "Currently we're sitting at 25 total, including myself."
Laura: 25 men standing around. Don't you think it's going to be a little curious as to why all of the sudden-- all of a sudden? There's a large number of people around, that's never been there before?
Matt: "You're asking me this, our plan was to go inside while it was out. But if you want us there, let's figure out a way to hide, then. I don't think my men are going to like to be underground."
Marisha: It'll be very spacious. It'll be a nice big tunnel, it's not going to feel like you're buried alive.
Matt: "And what, they just leap out one by one through an opening?"
Laura: It'll be super shallow. Just enough that they can come on up and out.
Marisha: It'll be awesome, it will look like they're coming out of the grave. They'll look like badasses!
Matt: "I don't think that's going to really get a dragon shaking in its claws, y'know?" (sighs)
Laura: Not a lot is going to get a dragon shaking in its claws.
Matt: "Let me talk to my men. We'll see what we can do, we can muster as far as these chains go."
Laura: A surprise attack is going to be one of our best shots at grounding this thing.
Matt: "So, am I to tell my men we're going to bury them in the ground?"
Marisha: Not bury them, that sounds so dramatic when you say it like that, I mean I'm going to make a tunnel, there'll be stairs, they'll be able to walk freely, they'll have air holes, it'll be just like when you moved through the sewers to not be seen.
Matt: "I'll talk to them. I certainly hope your magic stone-shaping is as strong as it is. At the very first moment that dragon looks like it's going to go ahead and break free, we're weapons out. You do understand that."
Marisha: We would appreciate that, actually.
Matt: "Okay."
Laura: We want it to land, then we strike. We just want it to hit the fucking ground.
Matt: "Okay. And what's our bait? You say you have some gold to give?"
Laura: Some gold to give.
Matt: "Try for Kevdak's corpse-- I hope that's enough. I'll see what else we've got left in our coffers." He turns around and him and Warra walk away, a couple of the men join them and they--
Marisha: Oh, I actually-- I go over to Warra real quick before she walks away? Just to her side, and say, you look well. Have the Seers told you if it's going to be a boy or a girl yet?
Matt: "Not yet. But if we survive this, I have a feeling I'll know. The strength and glory of this fight will confirm."
Marisha: If you survive this fight, I'm pretty sure you'll bear the strongest child anyone has ever known.
Laura: The stallion that mounts the world, for sure.
Liam: There it is, there it is. It's in all our heads.
Matt: Nothing ever goes wrong when that title comes up. (laughter)
Matt: What could possibly go wrong? She looks over her shoulder at Zanror as he's walking away and goes, "Could be." And she just turns and starts walking with him.
Laura: So we really need to dig a trench.
Marisha: Yeah. I'm going to start digging a trench.
Laura: Around the area that the treasure is going to be.
Marisha: How far is it?
Matt: You guys scope it out, it's northwest of the town, you saw it on the way in, and it's very easy to make out at this point because there have been large claw-marks in the ground, there are broken pieces of wood, there's a shattered cart, there's some barrels that are partially destroyed to the side, there's a little bit of leftover ends and pieces that fell out of whatever it picked up as it took off as well as a smattering of copper, silver, and gold pieces that you rummaged through before when you first came to the town. But there's a definitive place that you recognize where this drop point is, it's out in the open in the field, there's going to be a couple of nearby rocks, a handful of trees, but they're all very sparse and spread apart. Other than that, it's just open field, so.
Marisha: How far away is the nearest tree cluster?
Matt: To that, it's about-- tree cluster? I mean, most of the trees that are here are singular, there's two trees that are within ten feet of each other and that's maybe 80 feet away from it.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: When you dig the trench, can I use my perception and my ranger ability to camouflage things and make sure that from above the ground, from the height that the dragon will be looking at it, that it's not seeable at all? I don't want this trap to be seen-- I guess I should wait until we find out if Percy finishes his trap and gets it in place to do all of this.
Matt: You can do that if you'd like to. Yeah, as far as the camouflage ability--
Laura: I know Hide in Plain Sight is for myself, but I feel like as a ranger I'd be able to hide tracks and stuff.
Matt: I'll say we can certainly give you--
Laura: We can use a little Dust of Tracelessness or something?
Matt: We can make something function a little bit there, you know, illusion magic is also helpful. If you have anything illusion-based that could even just help tidy up before. You do know that dragons are very perceptive creatures and are very-- are not very trusting either. They're paranoid. That is part of their narcissism, so anything you can use, whether it be illusion, camouflage, anything to hide any sort of possible chance of it not trusting this scenario you're going to want to do, otherwise this thing might fly overhead and notice one thing and be like ah, peace! So. Be warned. Miss Dragon Specialist.
Liam: That was all knowledge in your head.
Laura: I know all of these things! All of a sudden!
Marisha: Did he just say dragons have really high perception so don't fuck with anything and make it look weird?
Laura: No, he said if we're going to do it, make sure it is hidden.
Marisha: Right. Make it look real good. Right.
Travis: Can I go up to some of the guards outside and say, oi. Where do you keep your prisoners, hostages, meat shields?
Matt: I mean, there are no real guards of Westruun anymore, most of the guards that--
Travis: I meant like the goliath, the Herd guards.
Matt: Yeah, the Herd guards. They're a little sparse right now, there aren't any towards the outside of town, most of them are gathering towards the center as the rest of the folks are leaving the town, finding their way out south of Westruun to be away from the battle. But you do find in the Margrave center, similar area to where they were talking to Zanror, there are gathering warriors that are getting their weapons ready, some of them armoring up to just see how easily they can get it on, some of them might even sleep in their armaments, it's not a huge thing. But as you approach and ask this question, one of them turns to you and goes, "Well, there's-- the Iron Stocks is where we generally keep our prisoners. The ones who were before and the few we did keep, well, those we chained up or executed, but there were a few that were thrown in there."
Travis: Are there any still in there? Or are they all clear?
Matt: "Oh, there's plenty of prisoners still in there, we didn't touch the prison, mostly."
Travis: Hm. All right, thank you. (whispers) What was Reginald's daughter's name?
Laura: I don't know if I wrote it down.
Sam: I wrote it down.
Travis: I'd like to make my way over to the Iron Stocks.
Matt: Okay. And you've been here before, you know the Iron Stocks, although you weren't sure if it was being used as still a prison. And seemed loosely, just throwing a handful of people in for use later on that never quite came to fruition.
Marisha: I don't know her name either. We might not have known a name.
Travis: I thought we knew her name. Reginald's daughter's name?
Matt: Do you remember her name?
Travis: Are you asking me?
Marisha: What Sam wrote, he just wrote down 'Reginald's daughter'.
Sam: Maybe he never told us her name.
Matt: (laughs) All right, you make your way to the Iron Stocks. And it is currently unguarded, there is nobody there, the Herd has lost interest in it, the door's partially ajar, and as you walk inside you can already smell the place just reeks of refuse and decay. It looks like everything left in the middle of a workday. There are still ledgers open on the front desk, you can see what looks to be a small group of-- a barracks-type scenario to the left of the entrance that is just completely abandoned and looks like some cases are left open, scattering various keepsakes and bottles that are shattered on the ground, a lot of people left either to go into battle to defend against the dragon, to lose their life in it, or just to get the hell out of Dodge.
Travis: Can I walk up to the ledger and pretend to read it?
Matt: Yeah. You pick it up and leaf through for a few pages, lotta great squiggles.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Some pretty handwriting, you can tell--
Travis: Any squiggles that look familiar?
Matt: Um, no. No, none that-- I mean, some look familiar, some are more rounded--
Travis: Oh, this poor bastard right here, yep, I remember him, good chap. Hello? Is anyone in here?
Matt: There's a slight pause. Then you hear a voice echo from the right side of the room, down a hall just through the stone, you can barely make it out because the distance it's at, because you're hearing the echo protrude from quite a distance, but a voice just says, "Hey! Hey! In here! Need food please!"
Travis: Oh, shit. So I go in that direction. Open the door and try and make my way that way.
Matt: You charge down the hallway and there are a number of cells that are immediately here. Some of them are open and abandoned entirely, there are a few that you look off to the side, looks like a few individuals just passed away inside the cell. You come to a set of stairs that leads down into the next subterranean region and you hear the voice again, much closer, be like, "Hey! Hey! I hear your footsteps!" And you see a hand reaching out from behind some of the bars.
Travis: Put your hand back inside.
Matt: The hand retracts as you look over.
Travis: That's a good lad. What's your name? Before I approach. Still far enough away.
Matt: "Ah. Orn. Orn Finch at your service. Been in here far too long and very thirsty. I will be happily at your service, fair muscled man, should you see fit to relinquish me from these binds." And you look at him, he looks like a lowly beggar, longish tattered hair, wearing just general tattered and soiled clothing, no shoes, feet look blistered and black.
Travis: Ugh. I'm going to call you Orn Blackfoot.
Matt: "Blackfoot it is, Orn Blackfoot at your service, if you could just--"
Travis: My name is Lord Grog.
Matt: "Lord. It is my pleasure." And he reaches through and grasps your hand, his fingers are bony and thin, and he takes it and shakes it with what little strength he has.
Travis: Man, you are looking a little rispy-- Pour out a little ale into a goblet, and I give him a goblet of ale.
Matt: He snatches it from you and slurps into it, extremely thirsty.
Travis: Ah-ah, not too fast, not too fast, don't want to get the bubbles. And I reach into the Bag of Holding and I have a dry food ration. I have three left. Now I have two. And I give him some dried food ration.
Matt: He takes it and eagerly starts jamming it into his mouth. As he's eating, he's not even talking at you, this is just sheer hunger, the need to survive has taken over and he's just cramming it in there, choking a couple of times, keeping himself okay.
Travis: Pace yourself, lad. Tell me, why are you in here, Orn Blackfoot?
Matt: "Ah, well, this is-- everyone just started yelling and they abandoned us all here. It's been terrible hearing the moans and screams going silent. I thought they abandoned us all."
Travis: No, they did, to be clear. They totally abandoned you. You are really the only person I know of that's in here. All the other mates around you, they're either sleeping or, you know.
Matt: "I appreciate the food and drink, you've certainly done--" At which point a voice comes from about two cells over behind you that goes-- "Did I hear food and drink?"
Travis: Fuck.
Matt: "Food-- food and drink, please. Please."
Travis: Orn, did you kill all those dried food rations just now, did you just--
Matt: You see him very discreetly pocket some in his robe. "Oh, everything you gave me is gone, I'm sorry, friend."
Travis: Man, what an appetite. Do you mind regurgitating a little like a momma bird into my hand?
Matt: "What?"
Travis: Never mind. Orn, don't, heh, don't move. And I walk over to see where the other voice is coming from.
Matt: Okay. As you turn around the way, there is the next set of bars, you see behind there a man in his forties, also extremely thin and gaunt, reddish long thin beard, long unkempt brownish red hair that is just crimped up around the base of it, like it's just gone almost into dreadlock territory from how long he's been in there and mistreated. You can see dried blood at the corner of his mouth. He looks up at you. "Sir, if you would be s-- Grog?" And the moment of recognition hits you, this is Abjurist Noja, whom you previously-- (yelling)
Travis: Abjurist is a very powerful-- he has knowledge of the arcane and stuff, right, he was--
Laura: He was the guy who saved us! He saved us when the white dragon came to Westruun.
Liam: I was frozen in ice. That guy!
Travis: I found us Boba Fett, sweet!
Matt: He looks pretty wrecked right now.
Laura: Oh shit, give him food, Grog!
Travis: Abjurist Nosebleed, hold on real quick, look. And I take the other, the second to last dry food ration, I give him that, and I give him a thing of ale, I'm like, I'm sorry, it's really dry.
Matt: "Thank you, friend, thank you very much."
Travis: Oh, yeah, you're very welcome! Hold on. Is there anybody else in this hallway before I give away my last bit of food?
Matt: You hear two voices simultaneously down the end of the hallway come in, one of which is a very weak female voice, the other is a very loud kind of-- "Hey, bring me food this way, please!" The other one is like, "Please, I ask of you, I'm starving." And you see these two hands come out of the two cells in the distance.
Travis: Right, I'm going to pick a number between one and ten. Ready? Go.
Matt: There's an awkward pause. "Three?" "Seven! Definitely seven!"
Travis: I lean over to Abjurist Noja, I say, I actually don't know any numbers, so. Y'know what, we're going to deliberate and we'll be with you in just a moment. (whispers) Abjurist, how old y--, why are you in here, who put you in here?
Matt: "I've only been in here for about a week. Got in an altercation in my store when these brutes started walking in. Threw me in here, didn't even let me take my spellbook."
Travis: Oh, that is a crime. I love b-- I can't even say it. Hold on, stay right there, I'll get you out-- And I walk back to Orn Blackfoot, I go, look, hey, so I gave you food, can you do anything, like, special?
Matt: "What?"
Travis: Like, can you make your hands turn to flame, can you disappear, are you really good with a bow and arrow?
Matt: "No! No." And he reaches out and grabbing at your clothes though and starts pulling you--
Travis: Hey! Orn, chill!
Matt: "But I have friends in many places, though. I can, I can get you things. I can make connections--"
Travis: Yeah, but most of the people in here are dead, right, like they're probably not--
Matt: "Not even here, Emon! I can get you anything you need from Emon. I can get you from Stillben. And Lansway, just name it and get me out of here and I can--"
Travis: How long has it been since you've been to Emon?
Matt: "Few months?"
Travis: You got any loved ones there?
Matt: "Why?"
Travis: I don't know, just asking, like, do you want me to take a note from you to them or something, you know.
Matt: "No, if you can release me, I'd be more than happy to take it myself if you don't mind."
Travis: Yeah, no, I'm still deliberating, sorry. Enjoy the food that you snuck in your jacket pocket. And I go back towards the front desk area. And I try and find any-- is there a lever on the wall to release the cells or can I look for keys?
Matt: You-- make an investigation check.
Travis: Fuck me.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Your fate is in excellent hands. Oh shit, you're not dead! (laughter)
Travis: Minus two for a 17!
Matt: Ah! All righty. So. After spending the good part of an hour or so clamoring through, just throwing bookshelves over and (crashing) taking the desk and actually throwing it onto its back and pulling drawers out, this is Grog's method of investigation here, you're just--
Travis: Yeah, just trying some splinters of wood in the locks just in case.
Matt: Yeah, yeah. You break off a few forks in some locks.
Travis: (laughs) Forks, yeah.
Matt: In practice, yeah, whatever looks small enough and should fit, though it doesn't, but you make it fit. And it doesn't help. You do eventually find in one of the cells, closed and locked as you look by, there is one person in guard armor, in Westruun guard armor, that is in the cell. Not moving.
Travis: Hey. Hey, you. I kick him in the back a bit.
Matt: No movement.
Travis: I kick him harder.
Matt: No movement.
Travis: I look down the hallway. I back up a few steps. And I really run up and kick him really hard.
Matt: He just lurches over onto the side. Not moving.
Travis: Yeah, you're dead. Can I pat him down?
Matt: Yeah, you reach in and you can smell the decay starting to set in. And as you get close you can reach through the bars and see him, the actual area is closed and the door appears to be locked, and inspecting the body very quickly you can see that he was stabbed multiple times from behind and probably left in here to bleed out.
Travis: Low perception.
Matt: But you do find on him what appears to be a ring of keys. Not directly on his body, but underneath the corpse, like he was-- you gather best you can, someone probably grabbed it, got their way out, used that moment to stab him and escape.
Travis: Nice! I take the keys and I jauntily run by Orn Blackfoot and I go to Abjurist-- Hey, do you know who those other two voices are at the end of the hallway? Like, did you have anyone with you when you got put in here?
Matt: "No, no one with me. Although-- been plenty of angry discussion from that dwarven fellow down the way."
Travis: Yeah, he's got a really rough accent.
Matt: "I can hear you!"
Travis: Shit. My voice carries. Are you all right here for one minute? I have to go perform an interview real fast.
Matt: "I'm all right." And he just finishes eating the little bit of the ration that you gave him, like dried meats and bread.
Travis: All right, sit tight. All right, you two, put both your hands outside the cell where I can see them.
Matt: They both put their hands out. The dwarven man you can see puts his hand out, the skin is very wrinkled and you can see the varicose veins on it, the arm hair that you see on the dwarven arm is white, like bright white. The female hand comes out is thin, but the skin looks a little softer and younger.
Travis: Female elven, or is this female--
Liam: The daughter.
Travis: Who said three?
Matt: At this point, the dwarf voice goes, (incoherent semi-cursing).
Travis: I know, look, it's always lucky number three, right? That's what they say. Who says that?
Matt: "Racist little-- peh!" And the arms just withdraw, and the woman, "That's me, that's me."
Travis: Oh good. Hi. You look nice.
Matt: Look down, you see a young woman, maybe in her late teens, early twenties, long brown hair, tangled, covering one half of her face. You can see the edges of her lips are cracked from just dryness and lack of moisture. She's wearing, both of them actually are wearing just these long, simple cloth drape-over robes that are just, y'know, for any prisoners in here that need to not be wearing their normal clothing.
Travis: I've got three other goblets left, can I both give them a goblet and some ale, just to wet their lips and get a drink in?
Matt: They eagerly take it and begin scarfing it down, the dwarf's like, "Oh! That's nothing!" You can look at the dwarf now, he's elderly, crotchety, half-blind, one clouded eye, but for being a man who's been stuck in prison and slowly dying, he's got this wry grin on him at all times.
Travis: You're turning away good ale. Looks like you've seen many a moon.
Matt: "You're telling me that. But no, seriously, that's like half full. Come on, don't be stingy!"
Travis: I like your gall. And I pour more ale in.
Matt: "That's the ticket!" It's like spilling on the sides and getting stuck in his bright, bushy white beard, and each bit that dribbles down, he goes-- catches it and then pushes it back in, not wasting a single drop.
Travis: Beautiful. If you don't mind, ladies first, love, what is your name? Why are you in here?
Matt: "It's Amelia. I was taken because they were-- the beasts were dealing with an uprising from some of us farm folk and, well, they took me as leverage in the argument. Stopped their-- stopped their arguing."
Travis: You're-- you're farm folk?
Matt: "Yeah."
Travis: Do you have any family?
Matt: "I do."
Travis: What are their names?
Matt: "There's my father Reginald."
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: Sorry, I had a bit of split pea soup that's just disagreeing with me, it's all right. Yep.
Matt: "Are they okay, have you seen them? Have you seen any of the people out there?"
Travis: No, I-- we should get you out of here, there's really bad stuff going on outside, we're trying to get everyone out of the town.
Matt: And you hear a voice down the way say, "Everyone out of the town? That sounds like a great plan." And the dwarf behind you is like, "Well then, get us out! I'm sick of this cell!"
Travis: Yeah, just a minute, hold on. And so like. Hold on. Can I try the keys on Amelia's cell?
Matt: Mm-hmm. You go through the keyring, which probably has a good 40 or so different keys on it.
Travis: Shit.
Matt: And so you go through one, two, three, four, yeah.
Liam: Six, six, six.
Matt: (laughs) And what would be the late teens, and for what to you seems like forever, one key does (squeaking) in the lock and it opens. She, who's been like sitting down the whole time, stands up weakly and grabs the bars and pulls herself up and waits for you to let her through if she does, just being patient.
Travis: Amelia, if you would, please stay with me. Funny, I believe I heard of a man named Reginald. Very brave. Not sure where he is, but we're going to get you out of the city, just stay put for a moment.
Matt: "Okay."
Travis: All right, you, you salty bastard, what's your name?
Matt: "Old Davin. What's your name?"
Travis: Lord Grog. Emphasis on the Lord.
Matt: "Lord Grog."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "Lord of?"
Travis: The Vales of Strongjaw.
Matt: "I'll take it, that's fine. Get me out, please?"
Travis: Right. Oh, keys. Can I take the keyring and can I pry the metal keyring-- is it like one solid piece or is it the kind that I could maybe bend it open?
Matt: I mean, it is one solid piece that has been looped twice, but it has been-- the iron itself has been bent around itself to make it nice and tight, form-fit on one end. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Travis: 26.
Matt: Ping. (laughs) Like, you were preparing yourself for a full pull, and with but a minor twitch of your muscles it just bends open.
Travis: Can I take half the keys and give them to Amelia and say, love, would you go and let out the kind gentleman with the reddish beard and the little blood on his mouth named Abjurist, would you try these keys and see if his cell will open? Not yet for Mr. Blackfoot across the way.
Matt: "Right. I will, I will." She rushes off and starts fumbling through the keys, and you hear in the distance her making her way through the keys as--
Travis: I take the other half and start trying to get Da-- what was his name?
Matt: Old Davin.
Travis: Old, I like old.
Laura: Have we met Old Davin?
Matt: You have not met Old Davin, no.
Travis: Okay. Davin, what did you get put in here for?
Matt: "Right if I know! Got real drunk and woke up in here, everyone started screaming and running away, and I'm like ahh, run away you pansies, and they did, ran away, they never came back. Some packed fire, but not a problem now." And yes, the one snowblind eye doesn't move at all, the other one glances around, that one's completely stuck in a forward position.
Travis: Is that magic?
Matt: "I mean, certainly gets the ladies."
Travis: Yeah, it does.
Matt: "But no, it's a reminder to not, well, to not mess with your people."
Travis: Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. But they do make you look very young.
Matt: "Much worse, say I."
Travis: Now if we let you out of here, right, which we're actually in the process of doing, what is your weapon of choice?
Matt: "Oh, oh." And he thinks to himself for a moment. "I would have to say my weapon of choice would be Bloodvine ale. Aye."
Travis: Bloodvine ale?
Matt: "Aye, if we're picking poison, that's my favorite."
Travis: Yeah, no, my-- He's a dwarf, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah. Obviously we are brothers of the beard. Like, to fight with, right?
Matt: "Oh, that kills, eh?"
Travis: Yeah, stab, poke, enchant, whatever.
Matt: "Once upon a time I was quite a duelist, so if you got something pointy and prickling I can spear 'em with the best of them."
Travis: I do have a Greatsword of Frenzy, but it's a two-handed weapon.
Matt: "Ah, that's not my preference."
Travis: I do also have one regular, just a regular longsword. About the best I have.
Matt: "Yeah, that'll do, certainly, I'll take a longsword."
Travis: All right, so. Have I got the door open yet?
Matt: Not yet. But at this time there's an awkward pause and now you're like, don't have any more conversation. But you still have to finish the-- about a minute later, he's sitting there going, "Come on, come on, come on." Eventually-- tink!-- it opens up. "Yes!" And he pushes it open as you pull it open.
Travis: Before I give you this sword--
Matt: "Aye?"
Travis: --are you up for the fight of your life?
Matt: "Yes?"
Travis: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Yes, you may.
Travis: This is going to go really well. Eight! Nine!
Liam: Go Tarv, go Tarv.
Matt: He seems a little--
Sam: Scottish. (laughter)
Matt: He seems a little malnourished, and a little confused.
Travis: Right.
Matt: But nothing sets you off as untrustworthy.
Travis: Look, your expression says a lot. What if I put an excellent meal in your belly, sharpened that sword some more, would you like to fight for some glory come the morrow?
Matt: "Sure. Why not?"
Travis: That's what I thought. If you would go join Amelia, I have to get my good friend Abjurist Noja out of his cell and then we're going to go have a meeting, because there's going to be a big feast tonight, it's going to be delicious.
Matt: "Oh, great, I'll be there for that, aye. Where's it happening?"
Travis: You know, it's very secret, yep. Secret location, TBD.
Matt: "Right, right. I'll wait for you." And he walks out, taking the keys from you as he runs off toward Amelia.
Travis: Now, has she gotten Abjurist out?
Matt: At this point, yeah, Noja has stepped out of the cell and is putting an arm on her, you see he's actually having a hard time standing and she's helping support him, even though she's having a hard time standing. (Skype noise)
Matt: There goes Taliesin.
Travis: Man, I know a lot of people that are going to be really, really happy to see you.
Matt: "Ah. Really? Well, I'm very happy to see these people, anybody really, that're not the inside of this blasted prison." (coughs) (Skype rings)
Liam: Oh, get him, get him!
Laura: Quick, answer it!
Liam: Stupid tinkerer.
Sam: I'm trying, I'm trying!
Liam: Percival and his technology.
Matt: There we go. Welcome back.
Laura: Hi Percy.
Taliesin: Hi.
Travis: Could I ask you a question? So I have this new axe, right, it's really nice. I got it off the leader of goliaths, real prick. It's really strong and I've known about it for years, there's nothing, like, funny about-- Actually, if I give this to you, would you just tell me if you, like, hear anything?
Matt: "Ah, they took my spellbook when they threw me in here."
Travis: Oh.
Matt: "If we could find that, maybe I can help you."
Travis: That makes sense.
Matt: "Otherwise, I'm out of tricks, friend, sorry."
Travis: All right. I turn around to Orn Blackfoot and I'm like, "All right, mate. Last chance. Why should I let you out?"
Matt: "Because I can be a good friend and help you out. I can get you money and women and travel anywhere you wish."
Travis: I've done all three of those things more than most men do in three lifetimes.
Matt: "And you can have a fourth! Please, just let me out of here."
Travis: I'm thinking of a number between one and three.
Sam: He's not.
Matt: "Two."
Travis: Shit. (laughter)
Travis: That's like only one of a couple that I know. All right. You get to come out.
Matt: "Ah, wonderful. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And I'm a man of my word, don't you worry."
Travis: Can I insight check if he's a man of his word?
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Roll better. Shit fuck balls ass. Three.
Matt: Three. Seems legit. (laughter)
Travis: You have a face that is truly trustworthy. And I start looking for the key to his cell.
Matt: Okay. At this point, you've run through the ring enough, you can go ahead and take it from Old Davin. Over time you eventually get him free, and as soon as you do, he stretches, cracks his back a bit. "All right. Thank you kindly. So. Let's be off." And he charges up next to Noja and then breezes past them and you guys all exit the outside of the Iron Stocks.
Laura: Look for Noja's book, look for Noja's book.
Travis: Oh, yeah, well. Noja, Noja, is there a location where your spellbook was last? (belches)
Matt: "They took it from me when they arrested me. I don't know where they would have put it."
Travis: Yeah, well, goliaths are awfully fond of books. Let's go find out, shall we? And we go back towards where I guess everybody last was.
Matt: Okay. On the way there, Noja's like, "I do have one of my older spellbooks, wouldn't have all of my materials, but that would be back at my shop if we ever have a chance to stop by."
Travis: Well, we could go there now if you'd like.
Matt: "Certainly."
Travis: How far is it from here? I forget, it's been a few years.
Matt: "Oh, it's about-- just due east of where the temples are, about 25, 30 minutes up that way."
Travis: Hold that thought. I grab my earring and I say, can anybody hear me?
Sam: Can we?
Matt: At this point, yeah, the Stocks aren't too far. Whoever's--
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: What's up, Grog?
Travis: Right, so. What if I told you I found somebody's name that rhymes with Daburish Koja?
Liam: You found Dabney Coleman?
Laura: Dabdrist Cojo?
Travis: It's Abjurist Noja.
All: Oh!
Marisha: Man, I didn't realize 'til now how many people we actually know whose name rhymes with that.
Travis: Yeah, we're like really important.
Marisha: Yeah, we know a lot of people.
Travis: So I'm going to take him to find his spellbook, because I feel like he could be a great--
Taliesin: I don't recall this person.
Travis: You don't?
Marisha: Weren't you with us, Percy?
Matt: Yeah, Percy met him.
Taliesin: Was I?
Marisha: Yeah, remember the guy who saved us at the first Winter's Crest festival?
Taliesin: Oh yes, no, he was quite lovely.
Marisha: Yeah, he's very nice.
Travis: Yeah, I found him. I'm going to get him a spellbook. Does anybody want to come with, or are you all good?
Marisha: I'm about to dig a trench, so I'll pass.
Liam: Keyleth, where are you right now?
Marisha: Heading northeast towards, northwest, northwest. Sorry. It's noon, it's hard to tell in the sky right now. Northwest.
Laura: Are you with us, Pike?
Ashley: Yeah, yeah.
Laura: Pike's with us.
Ashley: I'm done attuning?
Matt: Yeah, the attunement takes about an hour or so, half an hour to an hour.
Ashley: Yeah, I just found you guys, just hanging out.
Laura: Hey, what's up. You want to help us clear some stuff?
Ashley: You need some help? Yeah, let me help you, I'm so strong.
Sam: Um, Grog, I can come with you, Grog, if you need some help.
Travis: Yes. The cube is always welcome.
Liam: My. Goodness. Gracious.
Travis: Please. It's more like a Coke can. Okay. Um.
Liam: A what?
Travis: What? So, Scanlan, if you want to come meet us, we're over by the Iron thing. How would I tell him where we are?
Matt: Iron Stocks, you can describe it to him and eventually he'll find his way there.
Travis: I'm over by this thing balalalala.
Sam: Excellent description, I'm on my way.
Matt: (laughs) And you've been to the town before, you guys have spent some time in Westruun, so you know the basics around. So you manage to meet up with these fellas and you make your way northward into the outskirts of Noja's shop. Noja's shop is untouched by the battle, it seems, still stands.
Marisha: Oh, shit. Really?
Matt: He walks up and the door's open and looks inside and just sighs heavily, as the interior of this place has been picked clean.
Marisha: Ah, son of a fucking-- looters!
Sam: Noja, were there any hidden compartments or secret safes where you kept the good stuff?
Matt: "Well. Follow me." And he heads towards the back of the shop, heads into a room in the side which contains his bed and his personal setup. That door's kicked in, there was a lock on it, the lock's still hanging as part of the door contraption as the actual door was just kicked inward and the wood splintered and left open. He steps inside, feels above the doorway. There's a panel of wood that he pulls aside and brings out. There is a singular book, where he pulls it out and sighs, blows dust off it. "Ah, this is a bit rudimentary for what I require, but it's something, it's better than nothing." Puts it aside, manages to find some pieces of his clothing that have been tossed onto the floor as a heap or, you know, raiding the room and gets out of his prison robes and puts them over that to just go ahead and not be as tattered as he looked. He does pull what looks like a small jug from it and sets that aside, and he looks around his room, (sighs) "I guess let's see if there's anything in the shop that still remains." Steps around the way. Oof. All right. Yeah, most everything of worth appears to have been taken or broken.
Laura: Search around, help him search!
Travis: Yeah, is there anything we can help you find that you're looking for?
Matt: "Anything intact, really."
Travis: Yeah, can we help him look for any vials, or--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Better. 17.
Sam: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. Looking around, most everything is ruined, destroyed, or missing, however you do find what looks to be two unspoiled, undestroyed vials that were part of a display set that has been tossed over the side. Most of the fluid contained in these vials, like corks have been left open, glass and crystal have been shattered, and the contents had just stained the floor and dried over time into little sticky pools of different colors. You do find two, one of which is a yellowish fluid that's streaked with black swirls, and there is one that it's like a clear liquid that has a-- the liquid itself fills the vial and then shrinks down to a tiny bead and then expands again to fill the vial, like a very, very slow heartbeat. Those are the two that you find.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Yellow with black swirls, and then a clear potion that--
Sam: Oh, he'll just tell us, I assume. Sir, we're about to embark on a deadly adventure to try to clear this town so that you can once again live here safely. Might we trouble you to borrow these potions if they can be in some way helpful to us?
Matt: "You've done me great service by getting me out of that hellhole. You are welcome to take these with you for now. I guess I have to start from scratch..."
Sam: Do you know what they are?
Matt: "Oh, yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry." And he takes the vials and looks at them. "Ah, this is a Potion of Diminution. It shrinks you to a smaller size."
Sam: Oh, I could be small! Oh, wait.
Matt: "It only lasts for a few hours, depending, the magic isn't perfect, but it does make you smaller. This other one, this vial contains a liquid that will make you quite speedier. It will increase your metabolism for a short time, the world around you seems to slow, it's quite effective."
Sam: Thank you so, so much.
Travis: Yeah actually, have you ever seen this shrinking potion work, like, how small does something get?
Matt: "Pretty small. Like, if on your size--" And he makes a shape of about that big.
Sam: So teeny-tiny.
Matt: "For you, yes. For you, you'd be about his size."
Travis: That would be the best thing ever. Now that you've found-- I'm sorry, go ahead.
Sam: No no no. This is most helpful. Do you know anywhere also around here where we might pick up some chains, hooks, spears, javelins?
Matt: "Ah, those are not my forte, my apologies."
Sam: All right.
Marisha: Should've took those from the prison.
Matt: "I mean, check a general goods store, perhaps?"
Sam: Oh no, this is so helpful, thank you, let me go get those.
Matt: So here are your potions.
Travis: That book that you got, it's not your favorite, right, the one that was hidden above the door?
Matt: "No, no, but it'll do, at least. Do you wish me to inspect that weapon for you?"
Travis: Yeah, would you mind? I've never done that before, but the last one I had talked to me.
Matt: "That's... unsettling. That's very unsettling."
Travis: Yeah, among other things.
Matt: The dwarf and the woman are still waiting at the door, they've picked through things and they're finding bits of broken glass and over time they can't find anything else. He takes the hour to rest and regains, after some quick preparation, the use of at least his Identify spell. Takes the axe, holds it for a moment, chants some incantation that you don't understand. There's a brief glow on the weapon, and around the outskirts of his fingers, a brief glow around his temples. As it fades, he goes, "Hm. Well, if what you worry about is the presence of some sort of sentience, I can assure you, you need not worry. This is merely a tool, and a powerful one at that." And he begins to tell you what it does, which is exactly what you already know after attunement.
Travis: No long card coming? (laughs)
Matt: No.
Travis: Son of a bitch. Thank you, Abjurist, you are as wise as you are. Old.
Marisha: Old? (laughs)
Matt: "I'm only 48, but thank you."
Travis: That's lost on me. Do you need anything else?
Sam: Oh, oi, oi, I was just-- I'm enthralled by these potions, they're fantastic, and I'm enthralled and so happy that we met you again and all that. I totally remembered who you were. (laughter)
Matt: "It's good to see that you're all doing fine, considering the circumstances. Stay safe. I'll pick up what pieces I can."
Sam: Should you get-- should we tell him to get out of the city or fight with us?
Travis: Well, I was going to ask, you do know what is beset upon this city, right? The horrible calamity that's coming?
Matt: "I saw the dragon tear through, yes."
Sam: We aim to finish the dragon, maybe even tomorrow, and make Westruun free once again. Would you have any interest in aiding us in this fight, or are you past the point of putting up a brave battle?
Matt: And you see him standing there, even just standing here this time, his knees are wobbling a bit, and he goes, "I'm afraid I wouldn't be of much aid at this moment without my proper spellbook. I have a few child's treats at my disposal." And he sifts through a few pages and he seems to-- the book looks like it's pretty old, like probably his training manual when he first began to study as a practitioner of the magical arts. "I don't know how much use I'd be, unfortunately."
Travis: The day's still young. What say we give, like, a solid effort to finding your bigger books, and then if you can't find it and you can lend no aid to us, we'll make sure you find yourself safely on your way?
Matt: "All right. All right, fair enough. Well come, let us look. Perhaps we should give another once-over of the rather seemingly destroyed interior of that prison."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Looks like Amelia and Old Davin have nothing else better to do, they begin to aid you for a bit, although Amelia is eager, and mentions the possibility of going and checking in on the farmsteads on the outside of town.
Marisha: Yeah. About that.
Matt: Orn? Orn Blackfoot? Gone.
Marisha: Yeah, figured that much.
Matt: He has peaced.
Travis: He left.
Matt: Yeah. You guys take a moment, and when you start deciding what to do, and you look around and he's just gone.
Sam: I thought you had him.
Travis: I thought you had him. I clearly said when you came up, watch the guy with the black feet. What'd you do?
Sam: I was watching you, you have disgusting black feet. You walk around barefoot, you're disgusting.
Travis: I really can't argue with that. (laughter)
Travis: Well. Whatever. I saved a life, go me. I'll take it later. Yeah, so can we go back to the prison, not to take away from everything else, and maybe look for chains, like some hooks, maybe some broken bars?
Matt: Yeah. The two of you guys, make one more investigation check, this'll signify the next few hours of looking for the things you want.
Laura: Oh god, roll really good.
Sam: 22.
Travis: 19.
Matt: Between the two of you, working into and past dusk, you manage to acquire quite a number of chains. It's funny, a prison seems to have a lot at their disposal. They have a queue of chains that are used of various lengths, some of them may have to be put together to make the length of which you're looking for, but between ramshackle manacles to just lengths of chain that are used to opening gates and used to seal elements of the subterranean portion of this prison, you manage to acquire quite a bit. You do, towards the end of the evening, manage to find partially destroyed remnants of Noja's spellbook. He seems a little disappointed as soon as he sees the state it's in, a lot of the pages have been burnt and torn out of these--
Travis: I am sorry.
Matt: "Ah, it's all right, there are some here that are of use to me. And if I can be of any assistance tomorrow in this fray, hopefully at a distance-- How big is this dragon, you said?"
Travis: Oh, it's like seven feet.
Matt: "Oh, well then I can definitely be of help there, not a worry, all right. I'll prepare myself best I can."
Travis: Yeah. We'll make sure, we'll keep you on the outsides with those that are not, you know, can't take a good walloping.
Sam: Do you have any healing potions or anything, or I mean, I'm sorry, healing spells?
Matt: "That's not my specialty, I fear, and the potions I had are now soaking in the floorboards of my humble shop."
Travis: Not that I would understand, but could you tell us what your specialty is?
Matt: "Abjuration, of course. That's the school of magic of which my--" (laughs)
Sam: I'm familiar with that.
Travis: Abjur--yeah. Mm-hmm. No idea what that means.
Liam: Like Claymation.
Travis: Oh, like puppets. I'm a big fan of puppets.
Sam: All right, well, we'll get some rest, try to put the pieces of your place back together.
Matt: "I will. Come to me when the time is ready to face this fiend, this foul creature, and I'm happy to help."
Sam: Good night.
Travis: Oh yeah, we should probably make him a part of the feast.
Sam: Oh. All right.
Travis: We'll come get you later tonight.
Matt: "All right."
Liam: I'm going to track down the women after talking to them over the earring.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Straight from Percival, once I catch sight of them, can I talk to you for a minute?
Marisha: Sure.
Liam: Just a minute, I know you're busy. Um.
Laura: She's super busy, brother!
Liam: Yeah, two minutes. Two minutes. Um.
Laura: So busy.
Liam: Thanks, Stubbs. You're way more powerful than I am, and I don't know what I'm going to-- (Skype noise)
Sam: God dammit.
Liam: What's that sound?
Marisha: So many noises happening.
Liam: You're going to be doing a lot more damage than I am tomorrow, it's not like I'm going to run up and stab the thing in the back. I feel like you're probably going to be too busy to be using Fassbender--
Marisha: Yeah, do you want Fassbender? I was actually going to offer him to you, 'cause I feel like you might--
Liam: I think I want to be of use, so yeah.
Marisha: I'm pretty sure you don't have to worry about that.
Laura: (gagging)
Liam: So it just goes on the head, then how does it work, what do you, what do I talk to it or do I think it or what do I do?
Marisha: So you give it a command, it takes your full concentration to give it a command, and then once you do that it will enact that plan until it's complete or until you tell it otherwise.
Liam: All right.
Marisha: And if you wanted to cast a Slow spell, just, you have to focus and tell it to do that.
Liam: Okay. Do I say like, slow?
Marisha: You know, I don't know. Just wing it. I kept talking to him like it was a person and I don't think that's necessarily the way to go.
Liam: Maybe I'll prac-- where did you park him?
Marisha: It's still in Scanlan's mansion.
Liam: Oh.
Laura: Is that still there?
Sam: Yes?
Matt: Well, based on the time that spell was cast, the 24-hour duration has expired. All things in the mansion have been jettisoned from the doorway.
Laura: Including your grandad!
Marisha: So he's in Wilhand's house, with Wilhand.
Liam: Great, well, I'll take that.
Marisha: Yeah. Hopefully Wilhand's watching over him right now, actually.
Sam: It might have destroyed the house.
Marisha: It might've destroyed Wilhand's house. Yeah.
Liam: Kiki.
Marisha: Yes? (Skype noises)
Liam: What is that?
Marisha: This is the weirdest field. (Taliesin makes noises on Skype) (laughter)
Liam: Percy. Tinker quietly, please. (Taliesin makes louder noises on Skype) (laughter)
Liam: I think he's eating popcorn, or maybe opening a butterscotch candy in the theater.
Taliesin: I can't even see you guys, are you like?
Laura: Oh, he went away! Aw, this is just not--
Liam: Okay, really quickly.
Laura: Okay. Well, at least he started.
Marisha: Yes? This seems to happen all the time, every time we try to talk to each other. I don't think I've really, continue, continue. It's hard to have a conversa--
Taliesin: Hi.
Matt: Continue, please.
Liam: Hello, yeah, Percival, I'll talk to you in a minute, all right?
Marisha: Shut up, Percy. Thank you.
Liam: Ah. I've been confused. I am confused. But. And I take her by the hand.
Liam: It wasn't fair, last week. It wasn't fair to you. And I'm sorry.
Marisha: What are you talking about?
Liam: In your room, in your room. Me leaving wasn't--
Marisha: When you left me, right--
Liam: --wasn't fair.
Marisha: Yeah, no, that I remember. Yeah, that. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Liam: That's it. I'm sorry.
Marisha: I'm sorry if I dropped that on you, and put any more undue stress, that's not what I want--
Liam: This is awful, all of it is awful.
Marisha: This is awful. Yeah, no, this is pretty bad. You know, I've actually been wanting to talk to you. I wasn't entirely planning on now. I know you've been struggling. I know you feel like you're drowning, and I'm sorry that the Raven Queen chose you, but she did choose you. You know, as druids, I was raised to have an interesting perspective on the gods. We are taught that nature is the one true powerful force. I have yet to see a god control the sunrise and the sunset, so therefore it's hard for me to sometimes have the same faith in these gods. Personally, I believe that just because you're immortal doesn't make you infallible. These gods can be great ambassadors of their virtues and what they represent, or they can be horrible disgraces to their domains. And just because some self-proclaimed person or deity decides that they want control? Doesn't mean that they have to have control over me. Now, this does not mean that I do not respect the gods and the power that they wield, but, I mean, for the love of Sarenrae, we have seen Pike do many a powerful thing. So, therefore, I do not respect the gods any more than I respect the living people who are standing beside me at this moment. So I've also been coming to terms with the fact that it seems that, whether we like it or not, we are going to have to employ their services. Looks like we're going to have to be working with them in some way or another, myself included, if we are going to overcome this. So maybe you should start rethinking the way you look at your relationship to the Raven Queen. Maybe this can be a fine partnership. A fine endeavor to do with her, and then once we save the world and we retire and some other young prodigies come forward to save the world again, then we can thank her for her services and move on. I don't think we'll always need her. I don't think you will always need her. And, keep in mind, the one true thing that gives these gods their power are their worshipers. So I guess I'll let you choose what you want to be. And I walk off to catch up with the ladies.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Did you guys make out? Was it really fun? Lots of making out there?
Marisha: Vax. Vex. Vex.
Laura: I understand you have him on your mind. You can't get our names straight.
Marisha: You know, I was talking to him, so-- Hey. I love you a whole lot.
Laura: Do you still think you're talking to my brother?
Marisha: I know who I'm talking to.
Liam: Really similar.
Sam: She's the ranger.
Ashley: Did you ask him if he's going to help us?
Marisha: Who? Vax? Oh.
Ashley: Vax. Is he going to help dig the trench?
Laura: I turn around and see him. Is he just standing there?
Matt: Just standing there lost in thought, yeah.
Laura: Um, hey.
Liam: What?
Laura: Hey, what are you doing? Are you coming to help us, or are you just standing in the middle--
Liam: Yeah, we gotta kill a dragon tomorrow. We gotta kill a dragon. What do you need?
Laura: Do you want to help build, I don't know, a trench? Set a trap?
Liam: I mean, I'm really weak, but I think I can use a shovel.
Laura: What time is it? We haven't even started digging the trench yet? What fucking time is it?
Marisha: It'll take me like an hour. It's fine. What time is it?
Matt: For you guys, at this point, it'd probably be mid-afternoon, late afternoon. Percy. I need you to go ahead and make three tinkering checks for me, if you don't mind.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: The first one is using your intelligence modifier.
Taliesin: That's intelligence modifier plus proficiency bonus plus tinkering?
Matt: Well, proficiency bonus is what you get with tinkering.
Taliesin: Yeah. 24. (cheering)
Matt: All right, so, initial designs and describing with your lackeys, for lack of a better term, that are helping you develop these springs, you manage to explain, lay out, and develop the proper materials, the process, and they seem to acknowledge and understand what you're trying to do, and you guys begin the work. Second check is going to be with your dexterity modifier.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, baby.
Sam: No one can help him on these things?
Laura: We're not there.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: You spend the better part of the day helping them take the metal, strengthen it, bind it, pulling it into the springs that are required. You complete one, you get partway through the second one. Make a final check if you don't mind.
Travis: With dex?
Matt: This is also with dex, yeah.
Laura: Come on.
Taliesin: That's 23.
Matt: 23?
Taliesin: Yeah, it's the dexterity, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: So yeah, that's right, 23.
Matt: 23. As the evening comes into about ten or 11 o'clock at night, after hours of aching work, sweat beads dripping down the foreheads of the three of you, forcing the furnace to work overtime. The room's heat and darkness eventually almost puts you to a point of exhaustion and passing out. However, you do manage to complete the springs. They seem to be functional, the structure of your trap is set. We shall see on the morrow if it is as functional as you hope it is. You do take a point of exhaustion through the work that will consist throughout the next day.
Taliesin: Okay. What does a point of exhaustion do?
Matt: Disadvantage on ability checks. So, essentially, any skill checks or ability checks you make-- not attacks or saves, but ability checks you make for the next 24 hours will be at disadvantage.
Laura: Did he work all the way through the night?
Matt: No, this is just the physical activity involved in getting it done in that short period of time.
Taliesin: Just double-checking, because I have no brain currently, dice roll, dex modifier, proficiency bonus?
Matt: What?
Taliesin: Just because I have no brain, dex modifier, proficiency bonus, dice roll?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: Okay, good.
Matt: You're good, you got it. As you guys find yourselves resting for tomorrow's trap incursion and hopeful defeat of Umbrasyl, we will take a break for the rest of you and come back here.
Laura: Oh, god! There's more we have to do!
Sam: It's okay, we'll do it during the break.
Matt: We'll come back in. We need a pee break. Quick one, guys. [break]
Matt: And welcome back. So, as you're preparing for this, what else do you guys need to do before the morrow?
Marisha: I dig a trench.
Matt: All right, so you dig the trench.
Marisha: I want it to be far away to where there's a tunnel and then make a circle around it.
Laura: We need to get Fassbender into the middle where the treasure's going to be.
Liam: I walk Fassbender out and I lay him down on his back, face-up.
Marisha: We have to do some stage-setting here. We have to set the scene.
Matt: Okay, as a note, when you return to Willhand's house, Fassbender and Willhand were both ejected from the doorway. Fassbender doesn't fit in that large room and wrecked part of the staircase from underneath but is fine. As soon as you acknowledge Fassbender to start moving, Fassbender, who has been inert this entire time, since left there for the evening before, takes a step and the area where the crack that you sealed earlier reopens. It looks like there is a minimal magical effect that was more of a cosmetic effect in the healing, but being a construct, it does not actually heal damage from it.
Marisha: Okay. Can I go ahead and take this time to do--
Sam: You're not there.
Marisha: Oh, I'm not there yet? Oh no, I'm building a tunnel. You're getting Fassbender. Never mind.
Liam: Yeah, I'm walking Fassbender out to where Keyleth is.
Matt: Okay. (stomping) Fassbender follows you out to that area of the town. As night has come now, the sun has gone, you guys are working in darkness. What are you guys doing?
Ashley: Vex, can I have one of your arrows? I want to make it real special.
Laura: You're speaking my language.
Ashley: Okay, so I grab one of her arrows and I cast Glyph of Warding on one of her arrows.
Laura: How many arrows can you do that do?
Ashley: I think just one.
Sam: Matt's checking his e-mail.
Matt: Within an object that can be closed, such as a book, scroll, or treasure chest. So yeah, it would have to be on something that, like a doorway or--
Marisha: Like a treasure chest? If-- can you cast it in like a barrel that he's going to break open?
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Thanks. I really enjoyed the idea of that.
Ashley: I thought it was going to work. It was going to be real cool.
Matt: So, you decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed in a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, so you could place this in theory on the ground near where the treasure's being left and give it the specific trigger for it to go off.
Laura: It can be maybe in a chest above Fassbender, 'cause he's going to be buried, and then it can be triggered maybe when the dragon lifts it up.
Marisha: What exactly does it do, the Glyph of Warding?
Matt: You can choose explosive runes--
Ashley: An explosive rune.
Marisha: Oh, so it, (explosion). That's cool.
Matt: 5d8 acid damage, cold damage, fire, or lightning or thunder damage. Your choice. Everything within a 20-foot-sphere radius around it.
Laura: 20 feet is really big. Oh my god! You know what you could do? You could make a trigger if he gets a certain height off the ground, and that way if he's over 20 feet above the ground, then it triggers and he's the only thing that would get affected.
Matt: Well, it triggers as a glyph, so whatever's near the glyph would be affected.
Ashley: So can we hide it in the loot?
Matt: You can, you can definitely choose some sort of a small chest or the ground underneath the loot if you want to.
Ashley: Okay. I'll find something in the loot, some little chest or something that I can put it in.
Matt: Okay, and what's your trigger?
Ashley: When he gets-- if he starts to fly away.
Matt: Okay. So if a creature-- the trigger would be, if a creature--
Liam: Pulls the glyph up?
Matt: That's up to you. What would you like the trigger to be?
Sam: Specific.
Ashley: If he removes something on top of it. But also if he grabbed it.
Laura: What if it gets above a certain feet in the air? Can it trigger then?
Matt: You can say if a creature flies above it at a certain height it can trigger. I'll give you that, yeah.
Ashley: Okay. So if it flies--
Matt: If it flies 20 feet above it?
Laura: I thought it meant if the glyph lifted in the air.
Matt: We'll make that one of the triggers if you want it to be lifted. So, if the glyph is lifted by a creature--
Ashley: So it can't be if he just touches it?
Matt: You could do that, yeah.
Laura: But it might be better if he lands and then we spring the trap. It could be a thing, if he tries to leave it explodes.
Ashley: If he tries to leave.
Matt: Okay. So, if the object is lifted off the ground, it triggers.
Ashley: Yeah. Even like this much? If it's just moved.
Matt: Okay, and you're doing explosive rune. What type of damage?
Ashley: I want to do cold damage.
Laura: Would I know, is a black dragon-- does it have any weaknesses?
Matt: You would know, with your knowledge and specialization, it does not have any weaknesses.
Laura: It has no weaknesses.
Matt: It is immune to acid damage, of course. But that is the only real information you have.
Travis: Make it acid damage. (laughter)
Ashley: I'm going to go cold damage.
Matt: Cold damage. All righty.
Laura: What about Fassbender? Is he immune to any damage?
Marisha: I'm pretty sure he's immune to most kinds of damage.
Liam: No, it's hitting and slicing. I'll check.
Ashley: I'm going to cast it at fifth level.
Matt: Fifth level? All right. That brings it to 7d8 cold damage. And what's your spell DC?
Ashley: 17.
Marisha: If we lose Fassbender--
Liam: He's expendable. Hopefully he survives. If not, good cause.
Laura: Can we fuse some chains into Fassbender so that he can be attached to the ground?
Marisha: I can. Can I do that? Right now?
Matt: Using what?
Marisha: I want to take and cast a Stone Shape spell, and then I want to open and almost make him a chain harness that's embedded into his waist? And then while I'm at it, can I patch him up?
Matt: Stone Shape is instantaneous. So whatever you want to do, it happens immediately. So, essentially, you could, with one casting of Stone Shape, seal the wound. With another casting of it you could then go ahead and have the chains--
Laura: Ready to go (squishing).
Matt: Yeah, just embed them in and have it seal. How many chains are you embedding in it?
Laura: Two big ones?
Matt: Two big chains? Okay. So you get two of the heaviest chains that you can find, which you probably got from the prison.
Marisha: All right, well, how about this? Vax, Vex, grab a chain.
Laura: All right. These are heavy.
Marisha: Okay, ready? On my go.
Laura: Wait, where are we putting it?
Marisha: I'm going to shove them in his abdomen. Okay? I'm going to make a spot and just--
Laura: You take left. I'll take right.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: Ready?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. As she does that, suddenly the chest wound opens up into these two big cavities. You take the chain edges and put them inside as they seal around them. There's now these two giant, heavy, door-holding chains that are now dangling for about 70 feet on each end from his abdomen.
Laura: Where do we attach these chains to? The ground?
Liam: One to the ground. Put the other one in a goliath's hands with a harpoon or a hook on the other end. Snag our prey, and then we have a Fassbender hanging from the bottom of a dragon.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You can find some metallic hooks just through general construction materials in the town if you want to.
Liam: I think we should do ten or 15 feet to the ground of chain and ten or 15 feet to the dragon, so that it's, thunk, and he's caught on the ground.
Laura: Just ten.
Liam: Yeah?
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: Yeah, we'll sever the chains with Grog's muscles. We need to get 'em the right distance.
Matt: About how long?
Liam: Ten feet into the ground, which we can--
Marisha: Do it right now. Ready? I'm going to do another Stone Shape spell into the ground.
Matt: You have to go around and find an area, because a lot of it's dirt. You have to find an area that has actual stonework in the ground. Otherwise, it's just earth that's pulling it. Go ahead and roll a survival check.
Marisha: Not bad. What's my survival? 24.
Matt: 24, okay. You take some time. It's about 60 feet out from where the drop point is, is the nearest piece of near-surface stone. It's about 15 feet beneath the surface, but it is viable.
Marisha: Negative. I will cast--
Laura: Why can't it be 15 feet below the surface?
Liam: But he's going to go up like a kite now because it's going 60 feet all the way over there, where stone is.
Marisha: I'm going to burn-- I did that earlier, but I'm going to burn my last 5th-level spell to do Transmute Rock again?
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So you said there was dirt? All right, let's dig a little bit of a hole real quick. So we dig a hole ten feet down.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Put the chain in there. Cover it back up. Transmute. Turn it into rock.
Matt: Okay, and with that, the earth-- Okay, what is the radius of that one there? Let me see.
Sam: We have to cover this up.
Liam: With dirt?
Marisha: And treasure.
Matt: Transmute Rock-- 40-foot cube. You turn that into a solid fucking subterranean block of stone. All righty. Now you have Fassbender just there, stuck to the ground with the chain at its side.
Liam: Fassbender, lie down. Lie down?
Marisha: Can I take my last little bit of Stone Shape residual energy and take that mustache Vax drew on--
Matt: Stone Shape does not--
Marisha: And make the mustache permanent that he drew on with charcoal?
Matt: Sure, I'll let that slide. With the remnants of the spell magic fading, the now-lying-down Fassbender staring up with his vacant sunken blue-glowing eyes towards the night sky and the stars above, your hand reaches across the face, and with that suddenly the--
Marisha: I like this, I want to keep it, there we go.
Matt: --the once-charcoaled curly mustache recedes into the face, carved permanently to his face.
Marisha: You look much better now, Fassbender. High-five.
Liam: Give Keyleth a very soft high-five, please.
Marisha: Yeah! Isn't that cool?
Matt: That'll probably bruise tomorrow.
Marisha: It's okay. It's cool.
Liam: I quickly take that same charcoal out and I write in Common on his chest: Conclave or bust. (laughter)
Sam: I'm going to go to Keyleth and ask if I can borrow the rod of immovable rodness. How big is it?
Matt: It's like that long. It's like the rung of a ladder.
Sam: Got it.
Matt: It's got a little button on the side.
Sam: Button on the side? Cool.
Taliesin: Like a Tron lightbike.
Sam: I love it.
Laura: When are we going to set the trap that Percy made?
Liam: As soon as he finishes it.
Marisha: Yeah, we should set the stage.
Taliesin: In theory, it has to be laid down underneath all the treasure so that it just is nothing, and then we put everything on top, and then basically it's set, and then pins get pulled so that it's set. And you don't disturb shit again.
Marisha: Hey Percy, we're ready to fly in the trap whenever you are.
Taliesin: Yes, let's do that, gentlemen. Let's move it. Good work, ladies and gentlemen.
Marisha: While you guys set the trap, I'm going to turn into a raven. My job is done here. I'm going to just go and circle while they're setting the trap and setting the stage and do patrol and make sure we're not being watched.
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Laura: Why this creepy music?
Sam: It's random, guys.
Ashley: Why is he doing his eyebrows up and down?
Laura: Because the fucking dragon's going to see us right now.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: 16?
Marisha: No, sorry. 15.
Matt: 15. You circle for a while and keep watch. So far, nothing seems to have caught your attention that's out of the ordinary. About half an hour passes before you see a group of civilians, along with Percy, wheeling on carts this large ramshackle construction made of support beams from houses, metal joints that were used as basic construction elements, as well as these large metallic springs on multiple sides with hooks and elements of a chain-based net that has been piecemealed together. Eventually you guys bring it over. You clear out the area.
Laura: Fassbender will lay on top of the trap.
Matt: Fassbender will lay on top of the trap?
Laura: Right? He can't lay under the trap.
Sam: Well if it's like a mousetrap, can't he lie in between it? Taliesin, how does it work?
Marisha: Let's just keep him right off to the side because if that trap triggers--
Taliesin: In theory, he should be able to fit right at the sides of it, because it's got an armature spring system. As long as you're not in the way of the armatures, you should be fine.
Matt: So you set it up and away, laying the sides down, precariously putting the pins in, holding it in an open position. You begin to take dirt, dust, and gathering up the area, trying to hide it to the best of your ability. Who is in charge of camouflaging this piece?
Marisha: Go ranger, go ranger, go!
Matt: Make a survival check.
Travis: "Which dice will I use? There's no way to choose."
Sam: Can I aid her in this bit of camouflage?
Laura: You want to sing me some inspiration?
Sam: Can I inspire her?
Matt: Sure, what do you want to sing?
Sam: (singing) R-r-ranger, turn and face the strange! R-r-ranger, looks like you're going to have to hide this shit! Time may save me, but I hope you-- also do-- (laughter)
Laura: 31.
Matt: 31. You guys take a good portion of the next hour or so, under her guidance and tutelage, hiding this entire trap, getting dirt, the top layer of sand to cover it so it looks like it hasn't been recently disturbed--
Laura: Little Dust of Tracelessness.
Matt: Little Dust of Tracelessness to fill in and smooth out any of the ripples of any possible passage that has come through. Fassbender has been-- (crash)
Matt: Killed. Buried beneath the surface, just to the point where he's pretty much flush with the ground of where it is. Contraption set, the objects placed back inside with some of the barrels and some of the leftover pieces of wood, the one overturned cart. You go ahead and take the chest and you place the glyph onto it. It takes a while to cast that spell, about an hour, but you complete it without an issue.
Laura: Make it look like there's treasure on it. I take some of the gold that we have and--
Matt: Place it onto it?
Laura: A thin layer, where it looks like a lot of gold but it's really just a thin layer of gold over top of rocks.
Ashley: If it's a chest, can we put some coins sticking out of it? So it looks like it's full?
Matt: You can do that. It does cost you about 200 gold worth of components to do this glyph, so mark off that from your personal gold supply.
Laura: Grog.
Travis: Yeah?
Laura: Question. We sort of thought maybe we could use Kevdak as a tribute, like we sacrificed him to the great shitty Umbrasyl. Is that his name?
Matt: Umbrasyl, yes.
Laura: But it doesn't quite have the same effect without his head. Do you still have that head? In fact, I think I might have the head. Did I put it in my bag of cold?
Matt: You did, I believe. You gave it to her to put in there?
Laura: Would that be all right with you, Grog?
Travis: No.
Laura: Don't you want to kill this dragon, Grog?
Travis: I want that head.
Laura: I don't have the head. I only have the gross bear tattoo off Kevdak.
Travis: That's right, I put the flayed skin. I don't have the head.
Laura: Grog, I can tell when you're lying.
Travis: I don't have the head.
Laura: You're lying. Grog, can we maybe-- you'll be able to get it back, because we're going to kill this dragon and then you can just go and pick up the head and keep it again in your Bag of Holding.
Travis: What's the head for?
Laura: So we can make it seem like we sacrificed Kevdak to the dragon.
Travis: What if you sacrifice me?
Laura: Well, what?
Travis: Yeah, use me as bait!
Sam: We'd have to chop off your head.
Marisha: No, we could just tie him to a chair or something.
Travis: Or I could just put my hands behind my back.
Marisha: Make it look-- wrap some rope to make it look like it's loosely tied.
Sam: What if he bites and kills you?
Travis: Well, I don't know, but it's better live bait than dead, right? At least when you fish.
Sam: Nope.
Travis: Pretty sure that's true.
Sam: Nope.
Laura: Do you want to be bait, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Does that sound fun to you, or--
Laura: There's exploding things around here. Are you sure you want to be in this area?
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: No, you don't.
Travis: (laughs) No, I don't. I will give you the head of Kevdak.
Marisha: Oh my gosh, it took a look from Pike!
Sam: Wow, that's a powerful look.
Travis: I want it back.
Ashley: You'll get it back.
Travis: You better promise.
Laura: I promise.
Travis: All right. You can have it.
Ashley: With a bow on it. You'll get it back.
Travis: I don't want a bow on it! He didn't ever wear a bow!
Ashley: No, I'm just saying you'll get it back.
Travis: I take the skull and roll it to her feet. It's still got flesh on it, right?
Matt: Yeah, it's a little soft, but it works. So you have the head of Kevdak at your disposal. Trap is set. Percy, who's pulling the pins, what's the trigger mechanism?
Taliesin: The trigger mechanism is any weight shift. It's the same as a mousetrap. It's like you put pressure on it, you take pressure off of it, doesn't matter. As long as there's immediate weight shift in the platform, where the booty is, it just goes snap.
Matt: Okay. So very carefully and very precariously, you all have set this trap as the final element, aside from the camouflage. Is there anything else you would like to add with this very sensitive large situation being finished?
Sam: Where are we hiding?
Laura: We're going to hide in the trenches, yes?
Marisha: It depends on where you want to hide, I guess. (caws)
Taliesin: As long as I'm within range for my guns, I'm going to hide way off in the treeline.
Marisha: Yeah, there were two trees that were 80 feet? Or 60?
Matt: Which, Ryan, can I get the box of tree materials? Thank you.
Sam: You know, that box of trees that you have.
Ashley: Are we near any structures or any houses?
Matt: No, this is outside of town. It's an open field other than a handful of trees. Just to give you guys perspective right here, this is the setup right now. This is the central area where most things have been dropped. There are pieces here. If you want to put it into perspective here, the glyph lies over in this area. Most of the treasure's been placed in that area. The trap we'll say is set about in that area, with the central piece being the triggering mechanism.
Laura: And the trench is all around that?
Matt: The trenches are down in this area. Oh, now you say the trenches, are you saying they're covered or not?
Laura: They are covered.
Matt: So they're tunnels. They're not trenches. Where is the opening for the tunnel? Where would you like it to be?
Marisha: Far away.
Laura: There, on the other side?
Matt: This side over here?
Travis: Make it 50 feet at the most.
Marisha: I want it to be more than that, I'd like it to be 100 feet away.
Travis: You want them to get there in one turn, right?
Laura: You want to be able to get there right away on surprise attack, spring right out of the ground as soon as that trap triggers.
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: In theory, if the trap is sprung it'll make enough ruckus that anyone in those trenches should hear it.
Matt: Right, but it's more about the proximity of the exit to the trenches.
Marisha: Yeah, what I'm thinking is I've got a circle that I've carved around it. And then there's like a tunnel that shoots off this way and there's an entrance that they can walk in and get into their places.
Matt: You want them to just burst out, then?
Marisha: I've made it really thin like I did before, carved it nice and thin--
Matt: Okay. So the entrance is back here, then.
Marisha: I don't know what that means.
Travis: I thought we were all filing out of one hole.
Matt: That's what I was getting at beforehand. The intent is for them to push up and out?
Marisha: Unless you guys think it would be better?
Laura: No, I feel like they've gotta burst out, yeah.
Travis: I was confused.
Marisha: It's going to be cool, like night of the living dead-style! Orcs coming out of the ground! In my mind, it's really awesome.
Sam: In your mind, so many things--
Marisha: So many things.
Matt: There we go. All right. We have entrenched areas in this vicinity with you around it. What's the last things you need to prepare before the evening is done?
Laura: We need to have a feast.
Sam: Heroes' Feast.
Liam: I have a couple of questions. One, so I asked this outside but I just want to make sure. It says in the rogue section that longsword is something that I'm proficient in, but there's a rule somewhere that I can't find that says I can't use that for sneak attack? On page 95, it says I'm proficient in longswords.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: But somewhere else that I'm unaware of-- no surprise, motherfucker?
Matt: The attack must use a finesse or ranged weapon.
Liam: So it's not a finesse weapon.
Matt: A longsword, I believe, is strength.
Taliesin: No, wait! This longsword was being used as a finesse weapon.
Marisha: It has been used?
Taliesin: We had this discussion at one point. We decided that this longsword was a finesse weapon. Or it could be used as a finesse weapon.
Sam: Aloha.
Taliesin: Aloha!
Liam: In Hawaii, the longsword is a finesse weapon.
Taliesin: There's a beautiful view out this window.
Liam: Just want to know in advance.
Matt: I would say-- stretching it thin. We had agreed it was a finesse weapon for use, meaning as a dex-based modifier for you to use in combat specifically. When did this discussion happen, I'm trying to recall?
Taliesin: This happened when we were doing sword tricks. We were discussing whether or not I could actually use a sword. And what that would be like. Because we were having the conversation about whether you should take strength with the sword. I've obviously been using it as a dex-based sword, but-- I don't remember if that was specifically for me, or--
Sam: This is a tough decision. But you know, it's not a tough decision to subscribe to Loot Crate.
Matt: I would say because it is part of the intent of the weapon that the longsword, while it may be circumstantially used as a dex-based weapon for that purpose, it is out of your realm of expertise when it comes to using the sneak attack ability. It would not be able to sneak attack.
Liam: Lovely. I'm going to take off my Boots of Haste and my cloak. See if anyone else wants it, and I'm going to start attuning-- Can you use this?
Laura: What is it?
Liam: Circlet. Would you be able to control Fassbender?
Laura: Instead of shooting arrows?
Liam: No, Keyleth said you just say "zap," and he just does it until you tell him to stop.
Marisha: Yeah, it takes your concentration, so it takes--
Matt: Well, it takes an action to--
Marisha: I'm trying to speak in character, all right?
Taliesin: What do your Boots of Haste do and what does your cloak do, out of curiosity?
Liam: I want to see how much I'm giving up here. Haste will let you double your speed, you'll be able to do one more thing when you're doing things. Scanlan showed me some sort of potion.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm assuming that was a Potion of Haste.
Sam: I gave the Potion of Haste to Grog. We both found these two potions. Grog has the Potion of Haste if anyone else desperately needs it, and I certainly don't need to be any smaller, so I've given the potion of reduction? Reducement?
Matt: Diminution.
Sam: Diminution? To good old Vax here.
Liam: It's funny, because part of my idea was to go in with you. But I know that you have to do it to folk of your own size, but if I were little Vax, I could go with you.
Laura: Why can't you keep your boots on for that?
Marisha: Honestly, spellcasters, it's not as beneficial for us to have Haste.
Liam: That's true, but I'm wondering if anyone wants Fassbender. If I'm going in, I'm not going to be able to concentrate on that.
Marisha: Well, depends on when you're going in.
Sam: You don't know. Give it to Vex.
Marisha: If you focus on Fassbender and tell him to just attack or to cast Slow, he will do that until that dragon is dead. He will just continue without you having to focus on him.
Liam: I know. I just don't want to miss a shot to go into the belly of the beast with my little buddy here.
Marisha: That's so trite.
Sam: We were born to do this!
Laura: Does it have to be attuned?
Matt: Yes. So if you already have three objects attuned, you'd have to take one off.
Laura: No, I can't wear the circlet, dude.
Liam: All right, I'll wear it.
Taliesin: I could, definitely. If you could take the Haste Potion then I might take the boots, because speed would not be a terrible thing for me to have because then I get to shoot more.
Liam: I'm going to take this sword and I'm going to leave the Deathwalker's Ward on, that can't come off anymore, and the circlet, so the boots are up for borrowing and the Displacer Cloak is up for borrowing. Displacer Cloak makes you very hard to hit.
Laura: That's good.
Liam: And the haste will Haste you.
Taliesin: What does the cloak do, again?
Matt: Disadvantage on physical attacks against you. Until you get hit, and then once you get hit, it fails to work for a turn.
Travis: I might take that.
Marisha: The cloak?
Travis: Yeah. Oh my god, I'm going to take the belt off.
Sam: You're going to lose your beard!
Travis: You don't know that! This shit's in there tight. I take the Belt of Dwarvenkind, and I put it in the Bag of Holding. I put the Displacer Cloak on.
Matt: You will be losing 26 hit points to your maximum hit points.
Travis: What? Wait! Really?
Matt: Your constitution-- or no, it's plus two, so you'd be losing 13 hit points on your max hit points.
Travis: Never mind, no. Nope.
Matt: Because your constitution will go down without it.
Laura: I can take off my Bracers of Archery, too, and put something on--
Marisha: What do those do?
Laura: They just give me a plus two to damage rolls.
Liam: You're wearing a cloak, so if you wear the boots, you can click them and you've got more movement.
Laura: All right. Give me the boots. I'm putting the boots on.
Matt: Boots of Haste?
Marisha: Then I'll take the cloak, I guess. I'm going to take off my spell slot ring. And I put my goodie but my oldie circlet on.
Sam: Let's have a feast! Let's have a feast!
Matt: You guys prepare for the evening. You make your way back to town. Where are you having your feast?
Sam: Isn't there a central place that we killed Kevdak at?
Marisha: The mayor's? The big mansion.
Sam: Whatever that place is called.
Marisha: The Margrave's house.
Matt: All right. So you find your way to the Margrave's town square there, you can see a number of the remaining Herd of Storms are sitting around small fires in the center of the cobblestone. They're all war-painted up, you can see there's smears of various dark charcoal and/or crimson liquid smeared across them in patterns. There is a brimming tension of coming battle. You may do your Heroes' Feast if you wish. You can feast up to 12 creatures as part of it.
Marisha: I can also do a feast if I cast it at seventh level. But, fuck it, I'm going to sleep, so it doesn't matter.
Sam: You're going to do two feasts?
Marisha: Pike and I are both going to cast Heroes' Feast, so that way we can feast 24 people total.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: So tell Kevdak. Sorry, fuck! Tell Zanror his finest warriors, his druids--
Laura: And Abjurist Noja.
Travis: And Old Davin.
Liam: And his wife.
Marisha: So make sure we have Zanror, his wife, his druids that he mentioned; there were like two to three druids?
Ashley: Are there any magic-users in the room?
Travis: Magic-users or clerics.
Marisha: Magic-users or clerics.
Travis: Abjurist and Old Davin included.
Matt: So. That being the case. You guys have your meals in the center of town, summoned forth a grand Heroes' Feast, two side by side. The chosen soldiers step up and you all begin to feast upon your meal. The taste is great but you're all distracted as the energies of the divine enchantment of these food items fill your body and steel you against the coming fear, there is still the concentration in your eye as you all look off listlessly in the distance as you finish your food. It's now just pushing past midnight.
Laura: We need to sleep.
Matt: Everyone seems to go and find themselves to rest, a tense sleep before them. Anything else you wish to do before you go to bed?
Marisha: Rise at sunrise? Rise at dawn?
Travis: Wait, before we do that, didn't you do something that gave us an extra amount of hit points before Kevdak?
Ashley: I have Shield of Faith that I can put on somebody.
Laura: Will that last for 24 hours?
Ashley: It's up to ten minutes. I can do it tomorrow.
Matt: What you're thinking of is Aid, and that lasts for eight hours. That's the one that gives the additional hit points he just mentioned.
Sam: Does the Heroes' Feast give us additional hit points?
Marisha: 2d10, and you're immune to poison, fear--
Matt: As temporary hit points, should mention that too. It's a separate pool. So 2d10 additional hit points. You want to roll, Keyleth?
Marisha: Oh jeez. Don't let me fuck this up. Oh, that's not bad. 14.
Travis: 14? That's not bad.
Marisha: 14 from me.
Ashley: 12.
Matt: Okay, we'll say the 14 goes to your group, the 12 goes to the rest of them for the purposes of this. So that's a separate pool, the 14 hit points come off first before anything else.
Travis: If it's midnight, I would take Aid, just in case he comes in the morning, and if he doesn't, no harm done, you rest up anyway, right?
Ashley: Say it one more time.
Travis: I wouldn't mind taking Aid in case he comes in the morning. If eight hours pass I lose it anyway, but you rest up again.
Ashley: Do you want to have it for the night?
Travis: Yeah, just in case he comes in the morning.
Ashley: Sure.
Marisha: Well, when do we want to be at the trap? Dawn?
Sam: At dawn!
Liam: Just before.
Travis: Yeah, before first light.
Laura: He comes normally around noon, he said.
Marisha: So we need to be in our places by 5AM.
Ashley: So each target's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by five for the duration.
Matt: For each level of the spell, so if you cast it at higher levels, it's more.
Travis: How high do you want to cast it?
Ashley: Cast it at-- fifth is the highest that I have now.
Travis: Rock out. Go for it.
Ashley: Yeah, let's do it.
Travis: Five times five?
Ashley: That's, yeah.
Sam: You'll lose it when we wake up.
Ashley: Yeah, do you want it for tonight?
Travis: It'll hold for eight hours, right, or, but I lose it--
Matt: Eight hours, yes, but a long rest is eight hours, so.
Ashley: Yeah, it'll go away. Let's wait.
Marisha: What time of year is it?
Matt: It's winter cresting into spring--
Marisha: Okay, so we have long nights right now.
Laura: We need to go the fuck to sleep.
Marisha: So let's sleep for a good six hours?
Matt: Six to eight hours.
Laura: Set our alarm clocks.
Matt: You run on a pretty consistent schedule, being a ranger.
Liam: I wait until everyone falls still, and then I scrabble over to you. Are you awake? Yeah, you're awake.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm staring at you.
Liam: I don't know if it's the food you made or the fact that we're going to die tomorrow, but I want to kiss you. And I kiss her. For a while. Good night.
Laura: Did you use your tongues?
Travis: You're asleep.
Marisha: How does she see everything?
Liam: She's a witch.
Marisha: She's a witch?
Liam: She's a witch! Did you see the broom?
Matt: The evening's rest comes to fruition. You guys wake up as the very distant, dull blues of first morning light begins to crawl across the distant mountain ranges. Dead silent is the morning as the rest of the Herd begins to rouse and armor up. You hear the gentle clank of metal against metal as armor and weapons are gathered. Food is being prepared, cooked, and eaten without a word being spoken between them.
Sam: I just want to make sure that we're going around, passing out all the chains, attaching little hooks and jabby things and grappling hooks.
Laura: They know the plan. As soon as he lands on the ground, everybody springs up and--
Matt: Everyone springs up and hooks him.
Sam: If the trigger for that, they're going to be underground--
Laura: The trap should go (snapping).
Sam: If they hear a big clank, that's go.
Laura: Get up and out. Yeah, regardless.
Sam: Will they know that that's a big clank?
Laura: I'm sure it'll be pretty loud. There might also be an explosion.
Matt: All right. With that, Zanror, after having this discussion at the Margrave's makeshift war room in the front foyer, agrees. "Not to worry. I'll make sure the men have known. We'll sharpen the hooks sharp enough to dig into dragonhide, hopefully. We'll hold taut, and the moment that creature breaks free, weapons are to fall on it. Very well." He puts on the rest of his armor. Everyone's feasted for the morning. We've lost Taliesin.
Sam: Don't worry. His work is done. He made his trap good.
Matt: It's like he's on the internet in Hawaii or somewhere.
Sam: Let's do this.
Ashley: Right when I wake up, I am going to try Divine Intervention.
Matt: Right now?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. Hold on just a second.
Travis: Yeah man, it's as good a time as any.
Sam: Does it last for a while?
Ashley: I don't know.
Laura: You used it before.
Ashley: No, it's never worked.
Laura: Yeah, the guy showed up.
Ashley: That's something else.
Laura: Oh really?
Ashley: That wasn't intervention.
Laura: I thought that was Divine Intervention that made the guy show up.
Ashley: It's never worked.
Matt: So Divine Intervention, there are elements of it that could be preparatory. By the nature of it, it's more of a sudden prayer of desperation. It's one of those things where the effects can range. It can be something that's immediate; it can be something that's more long. Understanding that, acknowledge when would be the good time to use it, whether it be now or later. Depends on what you're requesting, what you're praying for.
Ashley: To come help us kill a dragon. So that.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a percentile dice, then.
Ashley: What do I have--
Matt: Roll 2d10. You may have a die that has multiple numbers on it.
Ashley: I do. Is this the percentile?
Matt: Yes. Roll that first. What'd you roll?
Ashley: What do I need to roll?
Matt: I believe you need to roll under your level. What did you roll?
Ashley: I rolled an 80.
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: It never works!
Matt: So, as you call to Sarenrae, the boundaries and barriers that keep the gods from directly interfering with this realm are particularly strong this morning. While you feel her glow upon you, her warmth and protection guiding you to victory, there is not more within her strength or sphere of influence she can grant you at this time.
Ashley: Dammit. I don't feel her warmth, though.
Matt: What else would you like to do?
Ashley: Just go eat.
Matt: All right, so the sun has come up, the hour hits to eight, nine in the morning, you're looking at about three hours until the dragon's--
Marisha: Wait, what time is it?
Sam: It's nine.
Marisha: Son of a bitch, we overslept.
Sam: No, we've been up since dawn.
Marisha: I thought we were trying to get in places before dawn.
Sam: Well, we're moving now. It'll be fine.
Marisha: I hate it when I oversleep.
Matt: All right. The rest of you and the rest of the Herd make your way north. The few people that have stayed behind in the town, the few stalwart, stand outside as you all march by, and they all acknowledge, bow their heads, some get down on their knees and pray for you as you pass. As you quietly make your way outside of Westruun into the plains between the dotted treed landscape towards the drop point. The Herd makes its way under the tunnel beneath the ground.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: All right. So they are now beneath the area. They are situated. There is the entrance tunnel off to the side that is currently visible and open from that portion. Do you wish to close or hide that tunnel?
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: I'm going in that tunnel, too.
Liam: Scanlan. Where do you want to go?
Matt: Grog, you have hidden--
Sam: I don't want to go underground.
Liam: Are we going in a tree?
Sam: We're going to go up in a tree. Let's go 200 feet away.
Ashley: I'm going to run up to Scanlan and I'm going to cast Death Ward on him.
Sam: What's that do?
Travis: If you drop below zero, you come back to one.
Matt: Once.
Sam: I don't need it. I'm okay. I know that you're very worried about me because of our love, but--
Matt: So Scanlan, you have Death Ward on you. You are now up in this tree here.
Sam: I don't need it. It jinxes me.
Ashley: I'm going to cast Protection from Energy, acid, onto Vax.
Matt: Vax actually already has resistance to acid because of his armor.
Ashley: I'm going to cast it onto Vex.
Laura: Thanks.
Matt: Okay. So Vex. Currently you have resistance to acid as long as concentration remains.
Marisha: I also cast Protection from Energy, resistance to acid, on Grog.
Matt: Grog, you also have resistance to acid.
Marisha: I'm going to stay in this cluster of trees with Scanlan.
Matt: Scanlan over here, okay.
Laura: I'm going to be up in a tree.
Matt: You're going to be up in the tree.
Sam: Different tree?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: I don't think we should all be in the same tree, guys.
Laura: No, I'm going to be in a different tree. Can I use my perception to see how hidden everything is?
Matt: We'll say up in this tree. You want to be up in this one over here instead?
Laura: Yeah, something far.
Matt: There we go. You'll be in this one.
Laura: I think Percy wanted to be in a tree, too, at a distance.
Matt: All right. We'll say Percy is over at this one here, watching his trap hopefully spring.
Liam: Vax is with Scanlan. Stuck like glue.
Matt: Is Trinket in your necklace?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All right. Where do you want to be? Did you want to cast your Aid spell on anybody before this happens?
Ashley: Oh, yeah. Yes.
Sam: Matt, we're more than 150 feet away, yes?
Laura: Some people.
Matt: Some people.
Laura: Like the trees are 80 feet away from the stuff.
Matt: This here?
Sam: I would like to be more than 150--
Matt: About 70-ish feet away is right here where these trees are.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You're about 50-ish feet.
Ashley: I'm going to cast Aid on Keyleth.
Matt: At what level?
Ashley: Fourth.
Matt: That's 15 additional hit points to Keyleth.
Marisha: Additional or temporary?
Matt: Not temporary, additional. Keyleth, who else?
Ashley: Scanlan, again.
Matt: Scanlan, and--?
Sam: Why don't you do it on yourself?
Ashley: Okay, I have low hit points. I'll do it on myself. 15?
Matt: Yep, 15.
Sam: Keyleth, can you help me?
Matt: Do you cast it again, or are you just happy with those people? You can cast it multiple times if you have the spell levels for it.
Ashley: I'm going to save my spells.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'm going to need help. I know a little bit about dragons. I don't know a ton. Can you help my knowledge of animals in any way, shape, or form? For some sort of a check, I don't know. I just want to make sure that I know everything I can know in the moment when checked.
Liam: Can bards inspire themselves?
Matt: No. At higher levels, he can.
Marisha: Theoretically, I could enhance your ability, but it's a concentration spell and I've already protected from acid against Grog.
Sam: Never mind. I'm fine.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: What does your cloak do? That I put on?
Liam: Disadvantage on attacking you.
Marisha: Like, melee?
Liam: Until you get hit, and then it's gone for the round but resets for the next round.
Marisha: Only melee, not spells, yeah?
Liam: That's right.
Matt: So, at this point in time, Kevdak approaches.
Sam: Zanror.
Matt: I did it again. Zanror and two of his goliaths stay there waiting, with the offering placed at its designated spot.
Marisha: Shit. I can't believe we're doing this.
Matt: Any last-minute preparations?
Ashley: I'm going to-- wait, Grog, where are you?
Travis: I'm down in the tunnel.
Ashley: Is that where I am?
Matt: Well, wherever you want to be.
Ashley: I want to be in the trenches.
Matt: In the trenches? All right, so you make your way into the trenches, pushing past all the rest of the Herd members.
Laura: I hide the hole.
Matt: All right. We'll say for the purposes of this spread so everyone knows where they're all hidden currently--
Laura: Everyone knows they need to not move at all and be completely--
Marisha: Quiet.
Travis: I'm down over here.
Sam: Pike, you're in the middle of it? Oh, shit.
Ashley: I'm just going to hide. I'm not going to be a hero.
Travis: I'll throw her out of there if something goes wrong.
Liam: She doesn't clank if she doesn't move.
Ashley: They'll see me shining with my shiny armor.
Laura: You're right. We need to be stealthy up in the trees.
Marisha: I come over the earpiece in the calm of battle and I say: if things go terribly wrong, rush to this cluster of trees. I have ways that can get us out. I feel like I should say something inspiring, but I don't have anything, so--
Travis: How about fuck shit up?
Marisha: Fuck shit up, as Grog once said. About two days ago.
Matt: Hiding off in this tree beneath you is Noja, invisibility spell and vanishes behind. Beneath the ground here, off to the side is your good golem friend hidden in the dirt. Quiet sets in, gentle distant wind as the midday sun begins to stroll through. It's quiet and quieter still. You can hear the gentle bristling of high grasses against themselves. The tension causes the muscles in the back of your shoulders and neck to knot up. Watching the sun slowly crawl to its zenith. (wingbeat noises) You look up, those of you who are able, and you see a dark shape, a shadow dart off from the top of Gatshadow. Circles around, past you towards the city. Comes back. Growing larger and larger as it does. As it comes within the vicinity, it drifts up with one large beat of its wings. And (impact sound) lands into the center of this vicinity. As it hits the ground, there is a tink! (creaking sound, impact) As giant claws made of wood, metal, and rotten, angry hooks slam up out of the dirt, sending a giant cluster of dust just filling the vicinity. It woosh-- wraps around, you hear the smashing of metal and wood and low, guttural roaring. Dust has filled the area, and, for a brief moment, you have no visual on what's happened. As soon as that hits, everyone around you in the tunnels bursts through the floor, smashing through as the tunnels begin to collapse inward. Also, I need everybody to go ahead and roll intiative.
Ashley: Did he move the treasure?
Laura: Not yet.
Liam: Come on meteorite die, don't dick me.
Marisha: Green, lucky jade. That's okay.
Liam: Matt Colville, this is on you.
Sam: It's not you, Liam, it's me.
Marisha: Fucking shit.
Sam: Not good. Liam, yours doesn't matter. Mine does.
Marisha: Is yours not good?
Sam: No.
Laura: What did you roll?
Sam: It's okay, we got this. Pike's going to win the fight for us.
Liam: Hey, can I use Luck for initiative?
Matt: What does it say for the ability?
Sam: It doesn't matter, Liam.
Matt: I'll find out here. It counts as an ability check. I don't see why it wouldn't.
Liam: It's up to you. You're the boss. I love you. You're the all-seeing eye.
Sam: The feast gives us advantage on all initiative checks, right?
Matt: Ability check or saving throw-- technically, you get plus two to ability checks, correct? I'd say, sure, you can reroll initiative if you want.
Liam: (laughs) It was the exact same number!
Matt: You use the Luck point, and your initiative is what it is. Starting at this point in time, everybody--
Sam: It's a fight.
Matt: We have 25 to 20.
Laura: 22.
Travis: 20.
Matt: All right, 22. Vex. The Herd actually rolled really well.
Sam: Good, we need that.
Matt: Grog. All right, 20 to 15.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19 for Percy. Is that it? So we have-- Noja. 15 to ten?
Liam: Big ten, which if you think about it rounded is like 100.
Marisha: Also big ten, which if you round it twice is like a thousand.
Ashley: 13.
Matt: All right. Ten to five.
Sam: Big five.
Matt: Big five, right there. Scanlan holding up the rear, there we go.
Liam: Gosh, plan B indeed.
Matt: At the top of this surprise round, I need Vex to go first.
Laura: Am I first?
Marisha: You've got, no, he has Fassbender.
Laura: He has Fassbender. I guess I'm just going to shoot it. I mean, what else can I do right now?
Liam: You do you!
Laura: All right. My Boots of Haste have been clicked.
Matt: All right, so you are now hasted. You may now have an additional attack action per turn.
Laura: Badass. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Wait. Yeah, because I'm still hidden in the tree, right?
Matt: Correct, currently. As far as you know. Hunter's Mark on Umbrasyl.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. I'm going to shoot him with my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. So I'm going to roll.
Matt: Go for it. Now, he is surprised, so you actually have--
Laura: Advantage.
Matt: Well, you have advantage because he doesn't see you, so yeah.
Laura: Okay, so the first one is 12 plus 15 is 23.
Matt: 23?
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Laura: 25.
Matt: 25 hits.
Laura: And 23.
Matt: 23 hits.
Laura: So. Okay, those are regular attack plus lightning arrow attack, right? I all of a sudden forget how it works. Plus 1d6 per arrow. 1d6 for the Hunter's Mark. And then 1d6 on the first one for the sneak attack. Okay. Plus the regular.
Matt: Herd's up next, and then Grog.
Laura: 31 on the first arrow.
Matt: 31 damage?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Nice!
Liam: Seven plus five is 12.
Laura: 12. Plus nine.
Matt: 21. You're not getting additional sneak attack for the other two hits, by the way.
Laura: Right, I know. I lost my-- 18, I think. 18 was the last one.
Matt: All right. So that was your Sky Sentinel attack.
Laura: That was my first attack.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: For my second attack, I'm going to shoot him with one of my dragon arrows. Should I waste it on him?
Sam: Of course, he's a dragon! This is it!
Laura: I have two of them. I've been saving one, but I'm going to use one on him.
Matt: All right.
Laura: This is still advantage because it's still surprise round, right?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: Okay. 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Laura: Okay. That's still my Hunter's Mark, and then-- I have a Jelly Belly in my thing-- And then that's 10d6 additional damage for the dragon arrow.
Matt: Okay, surprise round doesn't give you advantage, but you were hidden from the top of the round, so you have advantage.
Laura: Oh, okay. So an additional 10d6 damage for the dragon arrow.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Laura: No. 6d10. Sorry, my mistake.
Matt: There you go.
Sam: She's going to one-shot the dragon.
Laura: 6d10. (counting)
Sam: Matt, can I turn around and see Keyleth and Vax making out in the tree behind me?
Matt: They are not.
Liam: We're not making out! There's a slow trickle of wizz going down my leg right now, man.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm hyperventilating.
Laura: Sorry. 24 plus ten is 34 plus Hunter's Mark is another four. 38 on that attack.
Matt: 38 points of damage on the dragon-slaying arrow.
Laura: And then my third attack, I'm going to use the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Just so you guys are aware, this is over 100 points of damage in one round.
Liam: Enjoy those boots.
Laura: Do I still get advantage, because I'm still hidden?
Matt: No. At this point in time, I'll say you've definitely made yourself known.
Laura: 20?
Matt: Technically you shouldn't have had advantage on the other ones, but--
Laura: 20?
Matt: Pssh, arrow splinters across the hide, no effect.
Laura: Okay. Wow.
Matt: All right. Staying there?
Laura: I'm going to sink down into the leaves, yes, and try to hide better.
Matt: You have no actions to hide, but you're in a tree.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right. Finishing your turn, the Herd now is going to go. Shot from here, he's going to stay back. All move in, he's going to stay back here and aim. They can't even get in; there's so many of them.
Laura: I'm trying to duck behind some branches so he doesn't have direct line of sights on me, okay?
Matt: That's fine.
Sam: Man, what if this was all a trick and they actually work for him? Oh god, we're all going to die. It was all a trick! They work for him. They're going to kill us all!
Travis: If I were near you, I would slap you. Get a hold of yourself, man!
Matt: Throwing chains up, some of them leap up and jab the actual hook into the side and try to pull back. Having a hard time piercing hide. It's real strong.
Laura: Some of them can try to like swing the grapplings around the ankles--
Sam: Shh, don't distract him, he's adding.
Matt: I got this, don't worry.
Liam: Don't piss him off.
Matt: All right. We'll say about eight of them manage to actually get it into the hide. The rest either bounce off or can't find purchase into its hide and it just scrapes down, but the rest of them are trying to hold it down. "We got him! We got him!" And they're holding back. The archers all take aim. Misses, misses, misses, misses, hits.
Liam: Question. Did we give the chain attached to Fassbender to one of the goliaths?
Sam: No, it's buried in the stone.
Liam: To the stone, but one has to go on the dragon.
Sam: If that's what we planned, sure.
Liam: I don't know.
Matt: You didn't tell Fassbender to use it.
Liam: Oh, no. Okay. Cool.
Matt: That's two hits for all the arrows. All the rest of them are just smashing against the hide of Umbrasyl. No effect. That is seven points of damage and eight points of damage. They actually make it through. That's their round. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I go into a rage, and I would like to run up behind him with my Bloodaxe and make two reckless attacks against him.
Liam: He's got it. He's got a whole strategy. He's street-smart, this guy.
Sam: Intelligence of three.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Travis: That's really good. 28.
Matt: 28 hits.
Travis: So, that's 23 with three points of necrotic damage.
Matt: 23, three points of necrotic damage added in or on top of that?
Travis: Oh, that's part of it, yeah.
Matt: 23. All right.
Travis: And then the second one-- 22 with one point of necrotic damage.
Matt: Gotcha. Whack! Whack! It's a tough hide to cut into, but you're making small hacks into it. You can start seeing that damage is possible, though it's a lot to cut through. This is a very hefty, very old beast. All right.
Travis: With my bonus action, could I drink the potion of fast nuts? Potion of speed.
Matt: Well, isn't it a bonus action to go into a rage?
Travis: I believe you're right. Never mind.
Matt: Pretty sure it is. Let me double-check real fast.
Travis: I think you're right.
Matt: It's fine, yeah. Bonus action. So that's your turn? Percy, you're up. You're way behind the dragon, hiding by the treeside.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to cast Hex on the dragon.
Matt: All right, Hex on the dragon.
Taliesin: With a disadvantage to all strength checks.
Matt: Strength ability checks, okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to hold my turn until the dragon's turn.
Matt: Okay. You're just going to hold until it does something?
Taliesin: I'm going to hold until it does something, and if it does nothing, I'm taking my attacks, and if it gets away I'm taking my attacks. I'm just taking my attacks after him.
Matt: Okay. It is now Noja's turn. Noja is going to step out from here and is going to attempt to Lightning Bolt. From the side, he just reaches out, hand forward. Arcs upward in its direction. It fails its saving throw because it is held in there. It is currently considered grappled. It doesn't have disadvantage or anything, but I'll say from this standpoint it can't really move around a lot. It's going to take the damage.
Sam: (laughs) What was that face?
Matt: Terrible roll. 21 points of lightning damage.
Sam: That's 8d6.
Matt: At the end of his turn, it's going to use one of its legendary actions to make a tail attack against you. We'll say that'll be 27 to hit.
Travis: That'll hit.
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words on the attack or to reduce the attack?
Matt: If you want to.
Sam: I would like to.
Matt: Okay, so 27 to hit. You take, from the slam of its tail behind you--
Sam: No, I mean to, I'm sorry, I can't reduce the--
Matt: Oh, I thought, to reduce the attack not the damage.
Sam: The attack.
Matt: Okay. Go for it. Roll your d10.
Sam: Okay. (slide-whistle) A d10 is this one. Ten.
Matt: Ten. 17. What's your AC?
Travis: It's a 20.
Matt: 20. With that, the tail-- whack!-- slams into the ground. You manage to push out of the way just in time as Scanlan shouts up to the dragon.
Sam: Oi! You're so ugly you entered an ugly contest and they said no professionals! (laughter)
Matt: Just enough of a distraction in the settling dirt for the dragon to turn its head over and its tail swings just a little wide of you, Grog, as you sidestep, no effect. We'll say for this, it's less of a surprise round. I use surprise round liberally. Surprise was it grappling and everyone getting out of it and preparing for the actual assault.
Liam: It's more of a surprising round.
Matt: Correct. Umbrasyl does get a turn. Umbrasyl, very frustrated and angry at the circumstance, is going to attempt to break free. With disadvantage on the athletics check to try and break out of the grapple because of the Hex. All right. That is--
Sam: Is that a save?
Matt: No, it's not a save. It's an ability check. However, the strength-- (struggling sounds) cannot seem to break free from the grapple of the communal might of all the goliaths there. So that is unhappy.
Sam: Meaning Matt is unhappy.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: And three more dragons.
Marisha: Why the book?
Laura: Oh no, what are we looking up?
Travis: What's in the book?
Matt: Nothing's in the book, guys.
Laura: We're literally going to finish off this bag of Jelly Bellies.
Liam: If an ancient black dragon takes one hit point of damage, it cowers and dies.
Ashley: I'm looking for the popcorn ones.
Marisha: Thanks to whomever sent these Jelly Bellies, by the way.
Matt: That'll end Umbrasyl's turn. That brings us to Pike, you're up.
Taliesin: Oh no, that's my turn now.
Matt: Percy's up, then.
Taliesin: I'm going to take just a standard shot with Bad News.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Ooh. 28 to hit.
Matt: 28 hits.
Taliesin: 18 points of damage, with four necrotic. 18 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And I'll take another shot with Bad News.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: 20 to hit.
Matt: 20 does not hit.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Second shot just goes wide, firing off into the distance over the city of Westruun.
Taliesin: All right. Turn's up.
Matt: All right. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to Guiding Bolt.
Sam: Be beautiful! Be good!
Laura: At what level?
Ashley: I'm going to-- at third. Let me see this.
Liam: Is this an attack range thing, or does it automatically--?
Matt: Spell attack roll, so you roll--
Ashley: And then I add that? That would be a 29.
Matt: 29. Damn, what did you roll?
Ashley: I rolled a 19.
Matt: That's nice. That'll hit.
Ashley: Okay, so now I do--
Laura: 4d6 plus two more d6.
Ashley: 26.
Matt: 26 points of damage.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: All right. And the next attack against it has advantage. So Pike, you're staying. You popped out of the trench and you're up on the ground. You hit it with the Guiding Bolt. You can see the blast of divine energy streaks up and slams into Umbrasyl's side. The darkened black scales now have this shining beacon across the torso. Anything else you want to do with your turn, or is that it? You want to move?
Ashley: Yeah. I'm going to stay.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: But I'm also going to put a Spiritual Weapon, just a sword again. Can't think of anything right now because I'm nervous.
Matt: We'll say right here in this area around Umbrasyl. The magical light sword of Sarenrae once again forges itself underneath Umbrasyl, swings up towards-- Let's see, you did Guiding Bolt at what level?
Ashley: Three.
Matt: Third level. And Spiritual Weapon is second level. So that works. Lasts for a minute. Make a spell attack. Roll again.
Ashley: 19.
Matt: 19 total? The blade swings up and as it strikes against the dragon's armor, sparks of divine energy versus the scales streak, but no damage is done. The blade is unable to strike through the hide. Does that end your turn, Pike? Are you staying where you are?
Sam: Did you add your spell attack bonus?
Laura: Yeah, she did.
Matt: All right. You going to move, stay where you are?
Ashley: I'll stay where I am.
Matt: Ending Pike's turn, Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm going to hold my turn until Scanlan, no. Yeah, I'm going to-- Fassbender, slow the fucking dragon down now!
Matt: Okay, at which point suddenly dust streaks upward as Fassbender steps up out of the hiding place there. Fassbender focuses his arms out as the slow magic effect seems to take on towards it. What's the DC on it?
Liam: Oh, dear god. That's a good question.
Sam: Who has the Fassbender stats?
Liam: I've got it. Slow-- 17.
Matt: 17. And that's a wisdom?
Liam: It is wisdom. And Fassbender, just slow until the end of tomorrow, just keep going.
Matt: It rolled a ten plus nine, succeeds in the save.
Sam: Wisdom disadvantage save. I have Cutting Words-ed him.
Matt: That's true. Rolled even higher.
Liam: Question  he'll just keep doing that until I tell him to stop, right?
Matt: Yeah, but it has to recharge. If it doesn't, he might just start hitting it.
Marisha: He's got to roll to see if it recharges. It'll recharge on a five or a six.
Liam: Okay. With my bonus action, I drink that potion and I'm a tiny Vax.
Matt: Okay! With that, you have shrunk down to a small-sized creature.
Liam: (high-pitched) Do it, Scanlan, do it!
Sam: I think this is the first time I've ever been taller than you.
Liam: (high-pitched) Hey, buddy! I love ya. Let's go in that dragon's gut.
Sam: I don't particularly like small people.
Liam: (high-pitched) Do you think Keyleth will think less of me?
Sam: Yes, I do.
Matt: Is that the end of your turn?
Liam: Yeah, action, bonus action. Done
Matt: So Vax is actually like a few inches shorter than you. You're now towering over him.
Sam: I tousle his hair.
Liam: I'm like eight inches tall, if that's true! He's so small!
Matt: (laughs) You're like two feet. He's about two and a half.
Liam: (high-pitched) These are still sharp.
Sam: You're so cute!
Liam: (high-pitched) Heeheehee.
Sam: My turn?
Matt: So, it's your turn, Scanlan. Oh no, Pike, Vax, Keyleth, then it's you. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Oh dear god. Okay. I'm going to transmute the earth underneath him. Right? That's what I'm doing? That's part of the plan? So if I can do right underneath Umbrasyl, that would be fabulous.
Matt: Transmute Rock--
Marisha: It's a 120-foot range.
Matt: Yes, and a 40-foot cube in the range. So what are you doing?
Marisha: I want to do the area just directly under Umbrasyl, if I can, so that I'm not sinking the Herd around him.
Matt: Turning what into what?
Marisha: I want to turn the ground directly underneath Umbrasyl into mud.
Matt: Okay. The only piece of rock is the piece of rock that you put beneath where the chains were there. The area right beneath Umbrasyl is dirt, it's earth.
Marisha: Okay, I thought it had spread, because it's 40-foot, so I thought it was under Umbrasyl, but I could do something else--
Matt: A 40-foot cube, part of it would be under Umbrasyl, possibly, but for the placement of where you put that, it's going to be hard for you to do it without it pulling everybody else into it.
Marisha: Okay. Plan B.
Matt: You can do it still, but it'll probably take some of the Herd with it.
Marisha: Should I go with pillars? Yeah. I'll go with--
Sam: No.
Marisha: No?
Liam: Just do what you're going to do. Ignore the gnome. Go.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to cast Bones of the Earth, which I think I can pop up six pillars around Umbrasyl.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So, Grog, you want a boost? You want to stand on a rock?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Pike, you want a boost? Do you want a boost?
Ashley: Yes.
Marisha: Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. I want a pillar here, Grog. When you're ready.
Matt: All right, so you're putting Grog on a pillar.
Marisha: Grog on a big stone pillar, bam! And then, where's the button? Pike on a pillar over here, bam. Let's go ahead, I'm trying to trap him in here. I want to pin him as these go up, so let's do one here. Can I get whoever that is up on a--
Matt: Which one?
Marisha: Right up here.
Matt: All right. If I'd known you were going to use this spell, I would've brought the pillars.
Marisha: Oh. Surprise! We were trying not to tell anyone our plan.
Matt: I know, it's good. Now I know.
Liam: We wanted to keep you off-balance, Matt.
Matt: That's good. All right.
Marisha: Let's do another one over here. Bam. Pinning him in. One, two, what is that, three, four. One on the opposite side, over here. Umbrasyl's a big fatty so I can't get my laser pointer over there.
Matt: Where do you want it? Right there?
Marisha: Over here-ish. On the other side of this one. Can I raise a pillar through his wing?
Matt: Not through his wing, no.
Marisha: So flanking this pillar on the other side over there, if that makes-- flanking this pillar. So wait, move that one that you just placed over a bit.
Matt: This is like a summoning spell.
Marisha: You know, it's fine. You get the idea.
Matt: That one there.
Marisha: Let's do one up here.
Matt: You have one more.
Marisha: Knock him in the chin.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Hopefully that contains him a bit.
Matt: All righty. That finish your turn?
Marisha: Yeah, guess so.
Matt: All right. That brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. Here we go.
Liam: Here we go.
Sam: I turn to my little buddy and I say  are you ready for a ride, little man?
Liam: (high-pitched) Come on, big guy!
Sam: Before we go, I yell as loud as I can to Pike to inspire her with my bonus action first.
Matt: The range? Pike is quite far away.
Sam: Can't hear me, or it won't work?
Matt: What's the range, I think it's 60 feet, so yeah. She's too far away.
Marisha: I'm behind you.
Sam: Well then, am I within 60 feet of her?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Oh. Then I will sing her some inspiration and I'll sing. (singing) Westruun town a dead-end world, east-end boys and Westruun girls, Westruun girls. (laughter)
Matt: Take your d10.
Marisha: Fuck yeah, d10.
Sam: And then I sort of link arms with good old Vax. Actually, I hug him tight because we've gotta be tight together to do this, and I hold up my hand cone and I cast Dimension Door and I'm going to aim right for the belly of the beast.
Liam: And I say  This is so fuuuu--
Matt: Scanlan. You are not fully familiar with the physiology of a dragon.
Sam: No, I am not.
Laura: I gave him as much information as I could.
Matt: And you did. I would like for you to make an intelligence check.
Sam: Just an intelligence check.
Matt: This is your ability to ascertain based on what you've seen, your knowledge of the dragon, where possibly in its body its stomach may be.
Sam: Okay. Why not?
Laura: Is it advantage because I told him where it would be?
Sam: Nope. 12?
Liam: Can I give him my Luck?
Matt: (laughs) No.
Sam: It's just intelligence, right, there's no other--
Matt: Right, you add your intelligence modifier to it.
Sam: Yeah, it's two.
Matt: You would add two to that because of your bardic ability. Plus two to any skill check.
Sam: Okay, 14, then.
Ashley: Is there anything extra from heroes' feast? No?
Matt: No. So. Both of you grab hands and vanish. The darkness that hits your eyes upon vanishing doesn't go away as darkness still hits you. All of a sudden, you are plunged into a thick, wet, crushing interior. You have finished your Dimension Door spell. You are in darkness. You are being crushed between what feels like two layers of musculature. Both of you.
Sam: Hi, dude.
Matt: You don't know where each other are. You don't see the other person. There's no sight. You can't hear anything.
Sam: Are we touching at all?
Matt: Nope. The trajectory of the spell and the unfortunate circumstance put you guys on two different sides of a membrane, and you don't know where you are.
Sam: It's going great.
Matt: All right. Does that end your turn?
Sam: Yeah, that's all-- I'll use my movement to go--
Matt: You are both considered restrained, so your speed becomes zero, attack rolls against you have advantage, you have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws. Also, you suffer eight points of acid damage, reduced to four.
Sam: Awesome.
Liam: Who's got the other gatestone? I have one.
Ashley: Oh, I have one.
Liam: 60 seconds.
Matt: You also both currently have no air. At the top of this round, Umbrasyl goes (disgruntled noises).
Liam: Suck it, bitch!
Matt: "I will eat all of you!"
Liam: I'm a two-foot-tall rogue, you motherfucker.
Laura: I'm up?
Matt: You're up first, top of the round.
Laura: Oh my god. Okay, I'm going to cast Conjure Animals and I'm going to conjure two giant eagles right in front of his face.
Matt: I'm really hoping we can put more things on the battlefield, guys. I think that would be a cool idea.
Laura: (laughs) Sorry, Matt.
Matt: It's not like I don't have enough to concentrate on up there.
Laura: I'm sorry.
Matt: It's fine. I don't have two giant eagle miniatures, so we'll say, for the time being, this air elemental is a giant eagle.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: I'll say, with no facetiousness, this is all I ever wanted in my life.
Sam: To be trapped in the spleen of a dragon with me?
Matt: We'll say these are up in the air.
Laura: Okay, right in front of--
Matt: Because I've used all the height things for--
Laura: And Conjure Animals is an action, or a--
Matt: It's an action.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to tell them to attack his eyes.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: They get their own--
Matt: Own initiative, which I just rolled. What's their dexterity bonus?
Laura: You sent me a thing-- let's go with that. Hold up. Giant eagle, dexterity is 17, plus three.
Matt: So it would be plus three, that puts them at 11, so they are just above Keyleth and Vax. All right.
Laura: And then for my bonus action, I'm going to-- I can't cast two spells, even if one's a bonus action?
Matt: As long as it's a level two or lower.
Laura: Oh, okay. For my bonus action, I'm going to hide a lot? I'm going to hide.
Matt: You didn't start the round hidden, so you can't do that.
Laura: I wasn't still hidden?
Matt: No, you have to spend a bonus action to attempt to hide at the end of your turn.
Laura: Can I attempt to hide?
Matt: You'd have to be a level two rogue to do that as a bonus action on your turn.
Laura: But on my boots of haste I can use it to dash, disengage, or hide.
Matt: Oh, you're using your bonus action-- so your extra action, not your bonus action.
Laura: Okay, my extra action.
Matt: You can do that, yes. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: You vanish into the foliage.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Great. Finishing your turn, the Herd now goes. They're going to attempt to put the rest of the chains up to increase the DC of the grapple. There we go. So four more chains get latched on so they're holding. Each chain increases the DC of the grapple. All right. So as they're all holding it down, the five in the back that are going to take attacks on it are going to do so. That's a hit, miss, miss, hit, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, hit. Three hits. So four damage, five damage, and eight damage.
Laura: Wow, these guys hit real hard. How come they were hitting us so hard?
Matt: They're rolling really terrible. They get two attacks each. All right. And with that, the tribal druid is going to cast Blight on the creature. However, it does make its saving throw, so for the purposes of speed on this I'm going to use my dice-rolling app. That's a lot of dice to roll. That comes to 18 points of necrotic damage. That brings us to the end of that round. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Could I go into a frenzied rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: Excellent. I'm on top of a pillar, and I'm not within striking distance, right?
Matt: You can hit it.
Travis: From up there?
Matt: Yeah, it's pretty tall.
Travis: (laughs) I would like to use all three of my attacks against his backside, reckless.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Natural 20.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: 26.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: These are just regular. They're not great weapon master. 23.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Sweet. So the first one was the crit.
Matt: The crit. So go ahead and roll damage on that plus two additional d12s.
Travis: Right. That's a d12. 21 and two additional d12s?
Matt: Yep, 21 plus?
Travis: Ten, 31.
Matt: 31.
Travis: Seven, so 38.
Matt: 38 points of damage on the first strike. Next two strikes, roll for it.
Travis: That was awful. 13.
Matt: 13, all right. Last one.
Travis: That was also pretty crap. That's 16.
Matt: 16, okay. At the end of its turn it's going to use a legendary action to attempt to wing attack you. It's going to cost its last--
Travis: Oh, I did not add the necrotic.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: On all three of them. Three, six, eight.
Matt: Total of eight?
Travis: Total of eight.
Matt: All right. Expending two of its actions to use a wing attack, it's going to go ahead and start beating its wings as hard as it can, even with the chains amongst it. Each creature within 50 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 dexterity saving throw. Make a dex save.
Travis: (singing) I believe I can fly--
Matt: The only one of the party within-- what did you roll?
Travis: A nine.
Matt: Nine. All right. You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Reduced to...
Matt: Reduced to eight. Go ahead and make one more dexterity saving throw, just for my own sake.
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16. You are thrust off the pillar, pushed, falling, and hitting the ground, prone on the ground, the pillar remains there. You take an additional eight points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to four, from the impact. But you are knocked prone. The rest of the Herd here, we'll say for the sake of that, they do not save. Oh, man. They are all knocked prone, knocking much of the chains free from their hands as they're thrown onto their backs. Then it is still technically grappled, so it cannot fly half its speed, unfortunately. It does seem to have knocked a majority of the chains off its back. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Holding my action until its action.
Matt: Okay. That brings us to Noja. Noja's going to attempt another Lightning Bolt. It's the best thing he has at the moment. Oh, a natural 20 on the saving throw. Nope. Not bad. 15 points of lightning damage to Umbrasyl. Noja's then going to dart back behind the tree. Ending Noja's turn, it is now Umbrasyl's turn. Umbrasyl is going to go ahead and attempt to break free of the final chains that are there.
Taliesin: With disadvantage.
Matt: Correct, with disadvantage. But even so comes out to a 22. (crash) The rest of the chains that were holding Umbrasyl down break free.
Laura: What about the trap? Is he out of the trap then, too?
Matt: Well, the trap that's currently holding it in place is part of the whole setup. The trap is what's keeping it there, starting the grapple, and the chains are just there to increase the DC. So with that, the actual metal structure of the trap that held it in place is shattered. You can see pieces of iron go flying, wood splintering in this cloud of dust that is kicked up from the movement of the wings. Currently right now there are still hooks and chains dangling from Umbrasyl, but some of them have broken and most of them are unmanned at the moment. The dragon is going to (wings flapping) go ahead and--
Taliesin: Can I take my action?
Matt: You can, yes.
Taliesin: I'm taking a shot at him at the joint at his wing and I'm going to attempt to ground him.
Matt: Attempt to ground him? Okay, go for it. Roll for the attack.
Taliesin: Natural fucking 20. (cheering)
Taliesin: Oh no, oh my god, right now.
Marisha: He's taking a photo?
Travis: He's taking a photo.
Taliesin: Photo taken. Ha! Natural 20. It still doesn't necessarily mean he's grounded. It means he has to make a strength saving throw or he's prone.
Matt: Correct. So roll the damage first.
Taliesin: Roll damage. Oh yeah. That's double dice, so that's-- 23 points doubled is 46 plus--
Matt: Plus the modifier. So 46 is--
Taliesin: 46, yeah, plus the modifier now is 52 points of damage total.
Liam: That bullet came from the center of the Pacific Ocean!
Matt: Strength saving throw.
Taliesin: I rolled really well.
Matt: That's amazing. All right, so. Strength saving throw to try and resist the effect. That is a failure. It's going to use one of its legendary actions to automatically succeed, one of its legendary resistances. So succeeds. Rising up from the ground, because of all the guys that are knocked prone--
Taliesin: Wait!
Matt: What was that?
Taliesin: I was going to pop off a couple more shots.
Matt: You held your action, okay. So you fired, loaded, fired last round.
Taliesin: I was going to blow an action surge.
Matt: Oh. It's weird to do-- Out of turn action, it is a little strange to do that.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: He held his action. That's something you do on your turn as a burst. I'll say, probably have to wait on your actual turn to do that full bit.
Taliesin: No, it's okay. Go ahead.
Matt: Umbrasyl does rise up about 40 feet.
Liam: Here we go, Scanlan.
Matt: It's actually going to move back this way.
Ashley: Did he never land on the glyph?
Matt: He landed in the trap immediately and the trap set off, but he never grabbed the stuff.
Ashley: It was if he landed on it.
Matt: You said it was to--
Liam: Pull it off.
Travis: Yeah, we said to lift it off.
Matt: All right. Flying back at that point (flapping wings) just growling, absolute anger. Squeezed in its insides, you guys both feel this heavy contraction within its body as you guys watch this flow of greenish bile spittle begins to fill up and spray out in a line from its mouth.
Liam: Look at all those people.
Laura: Are they all going to die?
Matt: Everything there-- Okay.
Laura: The birds were up in the air, though.
Matt: Right, but the stream sprays down, it's not just a single bolt. It vomits it out and it lands over everything. That's how it works.
Sam: Pike, are you in there?
Travis: No.
Matt: All right, that comes to 15d8 acid damage.
Laura: 15d8?
Sam: I think a lot of those people will be fine.
Matt: So that's 81 points of damage to all those guys. They all just dissolve in horrible agony.
Laura: Oh my god, you guys, we're going to die.
Sam: No, just me and Liam. Both of the eagles just screech in pain as they're entirely ruined.
Laura: Good job, you fucking wastes of space. They didn't even get to fucking go.
Matt: Sorry. That's going to end Umbrasyl the Hope-Devourer's turn.
Marisha: The Hope-Devourer?
Matt: That is the full name.
Sam: So his middle name is The Hope? And his last name is Devourer?
Matt: Devourer. Married into it.
Sam: It's hyphenated?
Matt: Hyphenated, yeah.
Travis: Marriage fucked everything up.
Marisha: Yep, Umbrasyl the Hope and then marriage fucked everything up.
Matt: You guys have both entirely vanished, you both are inside the entity. All right, so. Keyleth, the line just stops right before you. It smacks into the ground five feet from your feet and you watch as the earth and grass beneath you just immediately turns black and seems to almost coalesce into this death-sludge in this long line. It just barely misses you. All right, that's going to end Umbrasyl's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: All right. So. I'm going to Guiding Bolt him again.
Matt: All right. You're now up on a pillar facing this giant flying dragon. Standing above the rest of the battlefield, your shield up and your Frostbrand to the side, you reach up and grab your holy symbol and go ahead and roll for your Guiding Bolt attack.
Travis: How high is he?
Matt: 30 feet. He went back.
Ashley: 28?
Matt: 28 hits.
Travis: Fuck him up, Pike.
Marisha: Come on, Pike. Can you bring him down any?
Ashley: I'm rolling what again? Sorry.
Laura: What level are you casting it at?
Ashley: Four again.
Matt: How many 4th-level spells do you have left now? Because you cast--
Ashley: I have two more.
Matt: Two more? Because you cast Death Ward, which is 4th-level, I believe, right? On Scanlan?
Liam: Well, what did you do? You did Death Ward. And is that it?
Ashley: The last Guiding Bolt.
Laura: Yeah, so that's only two you used.
Matt: Right. So you have how many more left at 4th-level?
Ashley: Two. Because the ring gives me one extra.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll that. That is going to be 4d-- how much do you get Guiding Bolt damage on that then?
Laura: 4d6 plus an additional two or three?
Ashley: At fourth level, that would be seven, then.
Matt: That would be 7d6 radiant damage.
Ashley: 22.
Matt: 22 points of damage.
Ashley: But I'll also-- never mind. We're good, 22.
Matt: You're good. Okay.
Ashley: And then I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: Okay, Spiritual Weapon, which is technically on the ground over here.
Ashley: And I'm going to move it to the back of his neck.
Matt: Let's see. Spiritual Weapon, can move it 20 feet and repeat the attack. It is more than 20 feet away.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: It's down there, so it can begin to shift upward in that direction. So we'll say that it's partway floating in midair.
Ashley: Can it get his feet?
Matt: No, it can't. It's too far away, unfortunately.
Ashley: All right, well, it'll start working its way up there.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Pike. All right. It would be the eagles' turn, but they got dissolved.
Laura: Thanks, Matt. Thank you for pointing that back out.
Matt: Oh, I like to. I also want to point out that you guys held my dragon to the ground for two rounds and hit it like a goddamn pincushion.
Liam: You'll feel better once Scanlan and I have dissolved.
Matt: I will. All right. End of Pike's turn. Vax, you're up first. At the top of your round--
Liam: I'm just going to take the dragon blade and I'm going to as best as I can drag it in front of me.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm going to cut the insides of this--
Matt: First, you take eight points of bludgeoning damage as it is crushing you, muscles tensing on the inside are just-- You're in between musculature right now and just being crushed.
Liam: Yes. Probably its sphincter. Now what?
Matt: You are restrained, so go ahead and make your attack at disadvantage.
Liam: At disadvantage.
Laura: But it can't very well avoid it.
Matt: It's about him being able to actually move and get it.
Liam: Well, I'm using the dragon longsword, which I've never used before. It's a plus one sword, so I get what?
Matt: Plus one to hit.
Liam: With strength?
Matt: It would be strength, but we've agreed that it can work as finesse for the purposes of a dex bonus, you just can't sneak attack.
Liam: I just can't sneak attack. All right. So.
Matt: Be grateful I'm being--
Liam: Whatever you want to do, you are the deity here. So this is a 17 to hit.
Matt: 17, you pull the blade and it's just unable to cut through this tense muscle and tendon.
Liam: Use Luck.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Nothing.
Ashley: Wait, what is this? Is this an attack?
Matt: He's trying from the inside.
Ashley: Can I cast War God's Blessing?
Matt: Does War God's Blessing require you to see the creature?
Ashley: Probably not.
Matt: We'll find out.
Sam: Yeah, probably.
Travis: Probably not.
Matt: When a creature within 30 feet makes an attack roll-- So, using the Guiding Bolt, you can see shifting somewhere in the body of Umbrasyl-- (laughs) You see this form moving in there. You know, based on what you guys have discussed before-- I hope you discussed this plan before.
Liam: We discussed it so much.
Matt: That's a plus ten bonus, is that what it is?
Ashley: Plus ten.
Matt: That hits, go ahead and roll damage with the longsword.
Marisha: Is this sneak attack?
Matt: No, he doesn't get sneak attack with a long blade.
Travis: But against dragons it does specific damage.
Liam: Yeah, it does plus 3d6, if I remember.
Matt: Let me look it up here just to be safe.
Liam: 15 from the inside.
Matt: 15 damage from the inside.
Liam: Hopefully that cuts me a little breathing room. And a question that only you know, Matthew--
Matt: The extra is 3d6, you are correct.
Liam: Am I within five feet of Scanlan?
Taliesin: An extra 3d6, not just 3d6.
Liam: I got 15 damage. Am I within, I'd like to use my bonus action to sneak attack if I can, if I'm within five feet. If Scanlan is within five feet of the creature, that's up to you. I don't know. It's crazy circumstance.
Matt: The reason that you would get sneak attack for having another creature within five feet is because it is harrying and the opponent is distracted--
Liam: The heartburn is not distracting it?
Matt: Not enough.
Liam: Not enough. Okay.
Matt: There's not a lot of threat to Umbrasyl.
Laura: You get a d8 plus your d6.
Liam: Yes, I know. I did it.
Laura: Then you did the additional 3d6?
Liam: I did, darling.
Laura: And you only got 15?
Liam: I only got 15. I would like to use the dagger to cut into him as well.
Matt: All right, go for it. Disadvantage on that attack.
Liam: Disadvantage?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Oh, that's no good. That's, nah, it's 12.
Matt: You can't even get your dagger out of the sheath. It's too tight in there. You are cutting through muscle, and you feel the body and the muscle just tense based on the reaction of the interior pain. You watch the dragon, but it's still keeping up in the air.
Liam: I'm okay. Okay.
Matt: You are beginning to suffocate.
Liam: All right.
Sam: Oh, jesus.
Matt: I mean, you can hold your breath for a little while here, but just letting you know, there is no airflow. You're not suffocating yet, but you know there is no air to breathe currently.
Liam: I understand, Matthew. I'm fucked. It's fine.
Matt: All right. That's your turn. That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm so scared. Okay, hang on. What the hell is the range on that? I'm going to just take a few steps forward, here-ish. Matt.
Matt: Right there?
Marisha: There-ish, move up a little bit. Just so I can-- Yeah, just ahead of the tree. And I'm going to attempt to cast Earthbind on him. He has to make a strength saving throw.
Matt: Strength saving throw. That is a failure. It's going to use its second legendary resistance, succeeds.
Marisha: Fuck, I knew it. Well, we've burned off two of his legendary resistances.
Liam: Also, I have no idea what the initiative order is, but Fassbender keeps doing Slow until I tell him to do something else, right?
Matt: If it recharges. Go ahead and roll a d6.
Liam: A d6.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Two.
Matt: Two. It does not recharge Slow. Fassbender is too low. Fassbender is just standing there now.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to take the remaining of my turn. Oh shit, I actually didn't want to move. It's okay. I'm going to turn into an earth elemental.
Matt: Okay. All right.
Marisha: And I'm going to take the remaining of my movement to move up--
Matt: Up?
Marisha: Well, he has 60 feet of movement, but I moved, what, like ten feet earlier, so.
Matt: 60 feet of movement? His speed is 60?
Marisha: No, I'm sorry. His Earthglide is-- Yes, 30, so he moves up 20 feet.
Matt: 20 feet, all right. That finishes your turn, Keyleth. Scanlan, you're up. Actually, at the end of Keyleth's turn, it's going to use a legendary action to use a tail attack against you, Pike, because you are within 20 feet of it. As it's in the air, its tail whips out toward you. That is a 32 to hit. (laughter)
Ashley: Yeah. Nope. No. Doesn't hit.
Matt: You take 22 points of bludgeoning damage.
Ashley: And I'm staying up there?
Matt: You're barely holding on up there, but yes. You take the brunt of it with your shield, and it almost knocks you off the side. You manage to take your sword and dig in to the opposite side and catch yourself on the edge of the pillar. It does not knock you off. Scanlan, it is now your turn. At the top of your turn, you take six points of acid damage, reduced to three, as you've found your way into the stomach. He did not.
Sam: Is it big in there?
Matt: It's fairly spacious, but it's all squeezed together right now. It's not a giant, empty void, it's not a giant pocket of air in your stomach, it is a--
Liam: Click, motherfucker, click.
Matt: You're also holding your breath. You are also submerged in liquid that is dissolving you.
Sam: I can move my arms, though.
Matt: You can. You're still pressed in but you can move your hands, yeah.
Sam: Okay, that's good. I'm going to get that rod out and click it.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. Pulling out-- This is going to be weird. All right. So you take out the immovable rod and click it and as you release it, it stays there aloft in the center. You have darkvision as a gnome, correct?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Right, so there in this space amongst the murky liquid you can just barely see its shape there and it is held aloft, yes.
Sam: Okay. That's good, that's positive, guys. We're getting somewhere. Is that my movement? Is that my bonus? What is that?
Matt: No, that's your action to pull it out and click it. Because it's not easy to do in your current circumstance.
Sam: Sure. Okay. Well, I guess that's my action and I guess as a bonus action I can't really do anything. (laughs) I can't inspire anyone because I don't think I can hear-- oh! I'm going to use the earring. Shit. Fuck. I'm going to just start screaming and say: can you hear me, Vax?
Matt: You guys hear through the earring, (incoherent high-pitched babbling). The air has now escaped your lungs.
Sam: Fuck!
Matt: You're not drowning yet. That ends your turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Do I get advantage on attacking it because of Guiding Bolt?
Matt: You do. The next attack, yes.
Sam: Did Vax reply?
Matt: Yeah, the Guiding Bolt, because the Guiding Bolt's technically the next attack, it did not give you advantage on the attack, because you're on the inside and you don't actually see the Guiding Bolt. It would go over to the next one.
Liam: I don't know what the fuck's going on, Matt, it's fine.
Laura: I've got to see, because I just want to know. How far does Grasping Vine go? Do you know, Keyleth?
Marisha: 60 feet? I can tell you super fast. No, 30 feet.
Laura: How high in the air is--
Matt: He is 30 feet up right now.
Marisha: You technically have a pillar that's 30 feet high adjacent to him that you can anchor it into a pillar.
Laura: I'm going to-- can it go from the bottom of the pillar up towards him?
Matt: If you want to. Down here, you mean?
Laura: Yeah, I want to try to grasp onto one of his legs and yank him back down towards the ground. Ooh, which would really hurt with the immovable rod inside of him.
Matt: Okay. All right. So using your bonus action, you conjure the vine as your one 4th-level spell.
Laura: I have two because I have a pearl of power.
Matt: Oh. So you would've had to have prepared that in advance. But yes, we'll say you do.
Laura: Okay. Oh, I didn't tell you. I should have.
Matt: You should have told me. But we'll say as part of the preparation you did that, okay. So Grasping Vine appears, lashes out from this pillar up at Umbrasyl.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. The creature has to succeed on a dexterity saving throw or be pulled-- what's the DC on your spell?
Laura: Um, 16.
Matt: 16. That is a nine plus nine, that is 18. So the vine whips out and Umbrasyl backs up and pulls the leg up and it just hits the air beneath. Kicks away the vine.
Laura: That was my bonus.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Okay, then I'm going to attack him three times with my hasting.
Matt: Go for it. Yeah, three attacks.
Laura: All right.
Matt: First one has advantage.
Laura: Okay. 24?
Matt: 24 hits.
Laura: Okay. And that's sneak attack, because he's got somebody close to him. Inside of him.
Matt: It's technically not sneak attack. It's not so much about-- there's somebody close, but a person that is not threatening him from his current physical space, it is a bit of heartburn for him right now. You don't sneak attack somebody from eating bad pasta.
Laura: Cool. Then just seven--
Sam: Did he move?
Matt: Not yet, no. So how much damage is that?
Laura: Ten.
Matt: Ten points of damage for the first attack.
Laura: For the first attack.
Matt: Second attack? This does not have advantage, only the first one did. What was your first roll?
Laura: Then it doesn't hit. Then 26 for the last one.
Matt: 26 hits, so the first one hits, sticks part in the front of its armor, doesn't seem to phase it, the second one it actually hits the wing and the wing just shatters it and knocks it out of the air as it's keeping itself up. The third one, however, does strike and hit and it'll actually go between the scales of the neck. Roll for damage.
Laura: Nine.
Matt: Nine points of damage. Both arrows sticking out of the hardened exterior of the ancient black dragon.
Laura: The Grasping Vine just still hangs out there?
Matt: Yeah, it's just chilling on the side there. As long as you maintain concentration, it'll stay.
Travis: Is it grabbing him or not?
Matt: It failed with the grab. All right. End of your turn? Is that what you're doing?
Laura: Am I hiding still?
Matt: You have to use a bonus action to try and hide if you began the turn hiding. Or you can use your extra action from the haste to do it, but you already used it to attack, so you're not hidden.
Laura: Ugh! Fine.
Matt: (laughs) End of your turn, it's going to use another legendary action to do another tail attack against you, Pike.
Travis: Is that the third one?
Matt: That is a natural one. Umbrasyl goes to swing and suddenly there's a pulse in the stomach as you see Vax moving once again on the inside and doing so distracts it and the tail just swings overhead and you duck below it as it just barely misses your head by inches. One of your braids actually comes loose from the amount of wind that blows by. That brings us to--
Travis: What's left of the Herd.
Matt: Herd's turn.
Travis: Come on, goliaths and Herd, please roll better.
Matt: He is going to rush up around here. Grab the chains that they can. The chains have broken, so they're going to go ahead as part of their plan to begin to just unleash weaponry, so they just run through--
Marisha: Have they all broken? Maybe some just came loose.
Matt: This was their plan. The plan they agreed to. They're all taking out javelins now. They had them at their side. They're all leaping up towards it.
Laura: Are they just the stupidest goliaths, that they're all clumping together again?
Liam: That's redundant.
Laura: These guys are dumb.
Matt: You've met...
Travis: Scholars, the lot. You're going to pay for that later, by the way.
Matt: All right, so they're all going to take javelin shots at-- miss. Miss. Two-- miss. Hit. Hit. Three hits. And so they're all just (effort sounds) chucking these javelins upward. Four, eight, that's 12, plus seven-- 19 points of damage from the javelins as some stick in then fall out, the wounds are now becoming visible. Umbrasyl's-- there's visible wounding but doesn't appear to be in dire straits or anything. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yes, I have two questions. One of the things I picked up from Kevdak were four enchanted javelins. What do those do?
Matt: They're thrown, ranged attacks.
Travis: And they're just enchanted?
Matt: They're plus one to hit and damage.
Travis: Just that.
Matt: That's it, yeah. It's a relatively simple enchantment.
Travis: What is my climbing speed? If my natural speed is 50 and I wanted to climb that column, what's the climbing speed?
Matt: Climbing speed? I mean, if you roll a decent climb check-- here. That would be-- I'd say that would be an athletics check to see if you can climb it, and I'd put it at about half speed. But you're also prone, so getting up from that's half your speed.
Travis: On my back, can I use my bonus action to drink the potion of speed, which makes me hasted?
Matt: Yes you can. You now have technically four attacks per round.
Travis: I do. And it doubles my speed, right?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Okay, so I have 100 feet, so can I stand up?
Matt: Yep. 50 feet.
Travis: Can I try and climb that column towards Umbrasyl's feet?
Matt: Athletics check.
Travis: That's not awesome. 18.
Matt: 18. You just manage to get to the top with the last bit of your movement. So you are up about ten feet from Umbrasyl right now, pushing on 15 at an angle.
Travis: So I have four attacks?
Matt: Yes. You're not in melee, though.
Travis: Yeah, so I'll use three of the enchanted javelins and the javelin of lightning.
Matt: Okay. All right, so you (effort sounds) finally with the javelin of lightning. So go ahead and make the first three strikes.
Travis: Reckless, all of them.
Matt: Okay, so with advantage on each of these. The range on the javelin strikes, I'm just going to pull it up real fast, since this is the first time you've used this.
Travis: Yeah, it's 120 feet for the javelin of lightning.
Matt: Yeah, within 30-foot range, so it's fine. Go ahead and roll. First one is?
Travis: It's an 11 plus-- just my natural like--
Matt: It's 11 plus one for being enchanted.
Travis: Right.
Matt: Plus your strength modifier and your proficiency modifier.
Travis: Oh no, my proficiency--
Matt: Which is plus seven, I believe. Plus-- so yeah, that hits.
Travis: Okay. Where's my proficiency-- oh five, I got it.
Matt: Yeah, you're looking at plus 13 with these attacks. The first one hits.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Second one.
Travis: Is 28.
Matt: Hits. Third one.
Travis: Is 19.
Matt: Misses. The lightning javelin you just throw and I think it hits.
Travis: And the second one, the last one is a 30.
Matt: The last one, I don't think you actually roll to hit with the javelin, it just becomes a bolt of lightning.
Travis: That's right.
Matt: So roll 1d6 plus eight for damage on two of those javelins.
Travis: So that's 12.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 14.
Matt: All righty. And now with the javelin of lightning. Makes its save. That is a 21 with the save. What's the DC?
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17, so it takes the half damage.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: What's the damage on it total?
Travis: 4d6.
Matt: Go ahead and roll that and he takes half damage.
Travis: 13.
Matt: 13, all righty. So 13, and then halved.
Travis: Six--
Matt: Six points of lightning damage. Okay. The last hit, the javelin turns into a bolt of lightning, and streaks through, hits and impacts and then just falls to the ground, the energy expended. Jamming itself into the dirt not far from the ground. End of your turn, Grog. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay, my first shot, taking a wing shot.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Taliesin: That's 20, that does not hit.
Matt: 20. It just ricochets off the armor.
Taliesin: All right, that's one grit. Taking another shot.
Matt: Okay, reload, and then shot again.
Taliesin: That hits. 30.
Matt: 30 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: 15 points of damage. And he has to make a strength saving throw.
Matt: Strength saving throw. That is a 19.
Taliesin: DC is 19.
Matt: Okay, so it succeeds.
Taliesin: It succeeds on the 19?
Matt: Yeah, you have to meet or exceed.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to burn an action surge to take a third shot.
Matt: All right. So reload, shot, reload. Go for it.
Taliesin: 21 does not hit?
Matt: 21 does not hit. It just steers wide, shooting past the beating wings.
Taliesin: Yeah, and then I'm going to just hide behind that tree and wait for my next round.
Matt: Okay. All right. Ending your turn, Percy. Noja is going to use the third and final Lightning Bolt, now arcing up to the entity. Makes its save with a 27. All right, bringing us to-- 8d6. 13 points of lightning damage against Umbrasyl from Noja, and Noja steps back behind, looking exasperated and spent on some of the upper-echelon spells at his disposal. Now it comes to-- actually, at the end of Noja's turn, Umbrasyl's going to use its last legendary action to make one more tail swipe at you, Grog.
Travis: Yup.
Matt: That is going to be a 29 to hit.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. You take-- that's really bad. That's 11 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to five.
Travis: I stay up?
Matt: Yeah, you stay up. (loud clanging sound from Skype)
Matt: What's happening over there?
Liam: Taliesin!
Matt: All right. Top of Umbrasyl's turn. See if this recharges. Umbrasyl is going to attempt to move to the left.
Liam: Yeah, try it, buddy. Internal damage.
Sam: The rod supports 8,000 pounds of pressure.
Matt: Correct. If the creature pushes against it, it must make a DC 30 strength check to move the rod up to ten feet in a single round. So. Nope.
Liam: That thing's fixed in space.
Matt: It goes to move and (grunts) and is feeling something tear through on the inside of its area so it stops with this sharp pain. Takes one point of damage, but the warning is there. It does not move. However, (laughs) the acid breath did recharge on a five. It's going to go ahead and go right there. Angrily lay down right there.
Laura: No!
Ashley: No!
Liam: But you're resistant.
Taliesin: Isn't he having plummeting issues if he's not moving?
Matt: No, if your speed is zero you plummet is how it works.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: No, they all fail. All right. They are all right over here. Wrecked. Wrecked. Wrecked. Wrecked.
Laura: Where's Zanror?
Matt: Zanror's right there at the bottom.
Laura: Where's his wife?
Matt: His wife is over here. And when I say wrecked, they're on the ground, their flesh dissolving and screaming in pain. The Herd has been heavily culled in but a few rounds. There's a little bit of horror to it. I need both Grog and Keyleth as an earth elemental to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: 16.
Marisha: I rolled a two with a minus one, so one. Not a natural one. Rolled a two.
Matt: You both suffer 82 points of acid damage.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Resistance, so I halve that?
Matt: Yeah, you take 41 points of acid damage.
Marisha: I'm in tank mode, so I'm good. I'm an earth elemental.
Matt: Unable to move, that is the end of Umbrasyl's turn. That's messed up. (laughter)
Matt: Pike, you're up.
Ashley: I am going to cast Blindness on him.
Matt: What's the DC on the check? What is it, is it wisdom?
Ashley: I think it's constitution. Constitution saving throw.
Matt: All right, constitution saving throw. That is 18 plus 14. 32. I think that succeeds.
Liam: You don't know. She might've rolled a 78.
Ashley: You don't know! That's fine. I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: All right. So it now shifts up into space as a bonus action, and you can make a ranged spell attack against it as the sword arcs upward towards Umbrasyl. Go ahead and roll, add your spell attack modifier.
Ashley: 29.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 1d8 plus five, correct? Pretty sure.
Ashley: 1d8 for every two slot levels--
Matt: You did second level for that one, because it was a bonus action. 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Nine.
Matt: Nine points of damage against Umbrasyl. Blade just streaks across and more sparks fly, but this time you can see it left a carve of glowing red mark across the scales where the blade managed to do some damage to it. That ends your turn, Pike. Vax, you're up. You immediately take eight points of bludgeoning damage as it begins to crush you from the inside.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to-- can I sneak attack this thing from inside? I'm inside him! That's very surprising!
Matt: It's different! It's not like a soft gooey center. All of its body is still very dense, sinewy muscle in the vicinity. You don't know where you are in its body, so you don't know where the actual weak points are. So, given those circumstances, your ability to barely move-- Probably not.
Liam: Probably not? All right. Well. I'm going to use my bonus action first to hit it. It's at disadvantage?
Matt: Yes. All attacks because you're still restrained.
Liam: Okay, so that is 19, which fucks up.
Matt: That unfortunately is not cutting through.
Liam: And now I'm going to use the dragon sword. Okay. That's a 21?
Matt: 21, just barely not able to cut through the dense hide, the blade is caught on what feels like a ligament or something, it can't quite carve through with your body all crushed up inside.
Liam: Well. I will, for my turn, suffocate and also Fassbender should still be trying to recharge.
Matt: Correct. So go ahead and roll a d6.
Liam: d6. Four.
Matt: Four. Fassbender's still standing there. On a five or six, it recharges. That ends Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. As an earth elemental I want to drop into the earth and Earthglide.
Matt: All right. How many feet are you going?
Marisha: With my 60 feet-- question, can I get across and to the top of this pillar here? Maybe?
Matt: Oh, right there?
Marisha: That one.
Matt: You can get up to there. You're wider than the pillar, though. You like--
Marisha: Earthglide to the top, so it's 30 feet tall. (nervous laughter) And I'm going to use my momentum to see if I can rocket myself out and see if I can jump and grab onto his leg.
Matt: Okay, so you're making this a jump action, then?
Marisha: Yeah, I want to shoot out of the pillar.
Matt: Using the momentum of the Earthglide?
Marisha: And shoot out with a waterslide trajectory, woo! Yeah? Maybe?
Matt: Okay. I'll say that-- It's pretty fast-- Also pretty heavy as an earth elemental.
Marisha: I'm thinking about it real hard.
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Marisha: So is that strength as a--
Matt: That would be strength as an earth elemental if you do not have a specific skill for it.
Marisha: I'm going to use Scanlan's inspiration. Ooh, that's good. 18 plus five, so, 23.
Matt: 23. You manage to leap and catch the bottom of its foot. (cheering)
Matt: You're not halting or doing anything to Umbrasyl other than the fact that you're holding on to--
Marisha: But I've got his foot. And I'm heavy as fuck. Well, if Fassbender weighs, what was it, like 1,200 pounds? 2,800 pounds?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: So I'm at least as heavy if not heavier than Fassbender.
Marisha: A ton is 1,000 pounds. Right?
Matt: 2,000.
Marisha: 2,000 pounds.
Laura: I thought a ton was 3,000 pounds.
Marisha: None of us fucking know. Why didn't we go metric?
Matt: The European watchers are like--
Marisha: Yeah, what are they talking about? Okay. I'm holding on for dear life.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I know from my experience going to the pubs with Grog--
Matt: Take eight points of acid damage, by the way, as you're slowly dissolving. Reduced to four.
Sam: I'm fine. How's my lungs?
Matt: Oh Keyleth, by the way, I need you to make a concentration check before I forget.
Marisha: Okay. Yeah. No, that's. Wait, do I add anything?
Matt: Well the DC is half the damage you took from the breath weapon, so 40. So who did you cast the resist acid on? You're no longer resistant to acid, Grog.
Travis: Copy that.
Marisha: Sorry.
Travis: No, it came in handy for the one.
Marisha: It did.
Sam: How's my lungs? Am I dying here?
Matt: Your air is out, you're still holding your breath, per se, but you have one more round before you actually probably start--
Liam: I would like to say that Liam O'Brien, who's a total wuss-puss, can hold his breath for like 50 seconds.
Sam: While you're screaming?
Liam: So Vax and Scanlan should be--
Matt: You're doing okay. He screamed and released all the air out of his lungs. So he's now completely collapsed lungs, no air to subsist on.
Sam: I'm almost out. I'm going to see if I can last one more round in here.
Matt: Okay, what are you doing? (laughs)
Sam: Well, as I was saying, I know from my time drinking with Grog that any sort of blow to the stomach will really make you barf pretty easily, so I'm going to set off a Thunderwave at level six and hope that he spits me up.
Ashley: Spits you both up, maybe.
Liam: I'm still in its anus.
Travis: We don't even know where you are, really.
Sam: You're done, friend, sorry.
Matt: All right, so at a sixth level we're looking at 7d8 thunder damage.
Sam: Yes. Thunder damage.
Matt: Go ahead and roll that.
Marisha: Do you need more d8s?
Liam: All part of the plan.
Sam: Yeah, this is totally thought-out.
Liam: The hastily smushed-together plan.
Sam: 7d8?
Matt: That is a DC, it rolled a nine plus 14, so it succeeds.
Sam: So it'll be halved.
Matt: Half damage.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: Eat some shit, Umbrasyl.
Sam: 25.
Matt: 25.
Sam: Only 12 points.
Matt: 12 points. I need you to make a constitution saving throw, because you are on the other side of the membrane from Scanlan and suddenly there's a giant impactful forceful blow as the outside of the stomach crushes--
Liam: Natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: You take 12 points of damage as well.
Liam: (laughs) Okay, I'll take it.
Matt: Constitution saving throw on Umbrasyl's part for-- Rolled a natural 20, so Umbrasyl's not vomiting.
Sam: Not vomiting.
Matt: Nope, rolled a natural 20 to see if it could hold it down. There's a boof from the inside of the dragon--
Sam: Does a little come up and he swallows it back down?
Matt: Basically. A little, almost.
Ashley: Maybe you got a little air though. For you.
Sam: I don't know, did that make a little air?
Ashley: Probably give you enough time to (inhales).
Matt: From the source of the force that probably pushed it away for a second, air is pulled through the esophagus instinctually as when the space opens it has to suck through, there's this (gasp) sound, so yes, there is a moment of air that is pushed back out. You can see upwards a brief little glimpse of light at the top of the esophagus as the mouth is forced open as the air is pulled in and the blast streaks out angrily. Scanlan, is that your turn?
Sam: I can't do much else. Do I have any movement?
Matt: You are restrained so your movement is zero.
Sam: Even in the water? I'm in a womb-like state.
Matt: You're not like floating in a giant pool of water. You're crushed against membranes with acid. Remember the scene in Akira when Tetsuo gets too big and the girl gets crushed briefly? You're in that middle period right there, you're between two folds of stomach lining and there is just acid all around. It's awesome.
Sam: All right. Then I can't really do much. Oh! Shit. No, I would've had to call it earlier. Never mind.
Ashley: What?
Liam: I just want to remind everyone, I am really small. I fit between muscles, bones, ligaments, anything.
Sam: I could have done Cutting Words after I cast my spell, but I didn't, so forget it. Shit.
Matt: At the end of your turn, it's going to use a legendary action to do a wing attack, actually two actions cost. Begins beating its wings rapidly in this vicinity. I need both Grog and Pike to make dexterity saving throws.
Liam: Scanlan, we're safe from all this shit.
Sam: I know! This is the best place to be. We're only going to suffocate and be crushed.
Travis: 18.
Ashley: 18.
Matt: Both of you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage and are thrust towards the edge of the stone, I need you both to make strength checks to resist the force to the blow.
Marisha: Hold on! Nice.
Travis: 21.
Ashley: Ten.
Travis: Is 15 halved for me for the bludgeoning, or is that already halved?
Matt: No, it's halved for you after that. However, you both are, from the sheer force of the wind, blown off the top--
Travis: A 21?
Marisha: What did you have to beat?
Matt: 23. Ancient dragon. You both fall and take an additional eight points of bludgeoning damage.
Ashley: I'm going to use my celestial shield and cast Featherfall.
Matt: Okay. So you take no damage from the additional seven. You catch yourself on the ground.
Travis: My eight is halved.
Matt: Yeah, you're both prone at the bottom of the pillars. All right. That was the end of Scanlan's turn. Back to the top, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to try Conjure fucking Animals again. By the way, I was wrong. My pearl of power only works up to level three, so I don't have two level fours, I already used the one. So. Conjure Animals, again, two more giant eagles out of the ether. This time I want to conjure them like ten feet above his head.
Matt: Okay. Actually, because I didn't see you I need you to go ahead and make a save as well, because you were on it as it's beating its wings, too.
Marisha: Even though I'm holding on to his leg?
Matt: Yep. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Marisha: That's not good. Four.
Matt: Four. You also take 15 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: Halved because I'm an elemental.
Matt: And I need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw.
Marisha: Strength? 19.
Matt: 19. You are blown off of the dragon's body.
Marisha: That sucks.
Matt: Like a rock slamming into the ground.
Laura: Oh, she knocked out a pillar on the way down.
Matt: You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage from the impact with the ground, leaving a small crater. However, there are two giant eagles that are now floating in the vicinity around the dragon. The eagles are summoned. Their initiative is not bad. They're going to be after Grog.
Laura: Okay. So they're above his head now, so if he shoots acid down, they'll be here. And their command is, attack his eyeballs. Okay. I'm going to use my boots of haste. For my perception, would I be able to see any weird little bumps on the dragon? Because my brother's been in there a while. Can I see anything going on?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: I'm behind his left nipple. It's pretty good already. It's pretty good.
Sam: Our earrings should work.
Laura: I'm sorry.
Sam: We don't need to talk.
Laura: 28. No, 29 perception.
Matt: 29? All right. You notice, on the outskirts of like the central row of scales, there is a small lump that is constantly struggling not far from the surface and is just darting around like a cartoon flea.
Laura: I'm going to aim right by there. But not quite at it. I want to make an opening around it.
Matt: All right. Roll for it.
Liam: Man, remember when we used to do hopscotch? That was the best. And then also we used to take baths together when we were really little, but that was when we were really little--
Laura: 20. Doesn't hit.
Matt: 20, it hits and shatters--
Ashley: Can I use War God's Blessing again? I use it every turn. Every round.
Matt: I think it's a Channel Divinity, in which case I don't think you can. War God's Blessing, Channel Divinity-- Which currently-- You can use it a second time between rests. Yeah. So you can.
Ashley: Let's do it.
Matt: So that does hit.
Laura: Oh, it hits?
Matt: Plus ten to the attack, so it hits.
Laura: Oh my goodness!
Travis: Pike!
Liam: Vex'ahlia--
Laura: Ten damage.
Matt: Let's see here, what's the range on that one?
Marisha: He's consulting the book again.
Matt: Just checking to see the range on that last because it does have a range--
Laura: He's getting my hopes up and then he's going to dash them down to the ground.
Matt: It's what I do. Creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, so you could not, unfortunately.
Ashley: What was that, say again?
Matt: Has to be within 30 feet of you. She's too far away. So that one does miss, shatters across the armor of the dragon. You have one more attack and then your extra if you want to.
Laura: That one doesn't work either. (mock-crying) Okay, that's good. 23!
Matt: 23 hits.
Laura: Okay. 11.
Matt: 11 points of damage.
Sam: Yeah, he's dead!
Laura: How do I want to do this? (laughter)
Matt: You can't summon it yourself.
Laura: Dammit!
Matt: Sticks into and pierces through. You feel a (impact sound) nearby. And what little bit of vision you have in the squeezed area, dark as it is using your elven darkvision, you can see what looks to be a part of an arrow point that has stuck through the armor.
Liam: I wrap my fingers around it.
Matt: Okay. Ends Vex's turn.
Sam: You don't know if it's Vex's. It could be anybody's!
Liam: Shut the fuck up, gnome!
Matt: At this point, Zanror looks over to Worra and says, "We have to go. Save our child." And Worra looks and sees all the dead around her. "Only if you come with me." Looks back and says, "No. I don't run from this. I'm going to kill this with my cousin." She turns and goes into a full dash this way, escaping. This guy's going to go ahead and begin to climb up. And gets partway up. Not all the way. Take a step back and make four arrow shots at it. That's a hit, a miss, a miss, and a miss. Takes an additional ten points of damage from the arrow. That guy over there is going to move around and he's going to grab one of the dropped chains on the ground and throw it up to see if it can wrap around Umbrasyl. Seven does not hit. It just arcs below and falls to the ground. That's going to end the Herd's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Still hasted. Can I stand up?
Matt: Okay, so 50 feet.
Travis: And with the Titanstone Knuckles, can I smash them together and cast Enlarge on myself? (cheering)
Travis: How tall am I?
Matt: You are twice your size, so you're pushing about 12 feet.
Laura: He's only six feet tall?
Marisha: He's gotta be taller than six feet.
Matt: It's roughly half your height, not perfect--
Liam: You're 15 feet tall now, Grog.
Laura: Yeah, 20 feet, you're probably 20 feet.
Marisha: 15 sounds nicer. Rounds up.
Matt: Don't argue with the DM.
Marisha: I'm not arguing, we're rounding up.
Liam: You're like two feet tall now and it's really impressive.
Travis: Being that I'm hasted, can I move directly behind Umbrasyl, like underneath him and behind? And can I attach the chain of returning to the Bloodaxe--
Matt: I assume it was attached before the battle.
Travis: Yes. And can I throw it at Umbrasyl?
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Do I have four? No, I just have one throw.
Matt: You have one throw. It hits and then you can pull it back.
Travis: If I want to.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Reckless.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: That's even better. 29.
Matt: 29 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: 21. With one point of necrotic damage.
Matt: 21 points of damage onto Umbrasyl. All righty. It is embedded in there. Do you want to pull back?
Travis: I don't want to pull it loose. I just want to weigh on it.
Matt: Okay, you weigh. All right. At the end of your turn, it's going to go ahead and make a tail attack against one of the eagles. That is going to be a 21 to hit.
Laura: I bet that hits.
Matt: The giant eagle takes 20 points of bludgeoning damage.
Laura: I'm sure that probably kills him.
Marisha: He has 26 hit points.
Laura: He's got six points left.
Matt: Okay, so the eagle right there has six hit points left.
Travis: Does enlarging do anything to my damage? Sorry.
Matt: You do an additional 1d4 damage with any melee attacks.
Travis: I didn't do that. Can I do that?
Matt: Melee attacks. Although the weapon does grow large. I'll say go ahead and do another 1d4.
Travis: Hey, four!
Matt: There you go. So that's an additional four damage. Great. So that's the eagles' turn. What do you got, Laura?
Laura: They're going to fly and attack his eyeballs! Fuck him up.
Ashley: Get him!
Matt: Roll attack, they have two attacks each, so roll four attacks.
Laura: Roll four attacks?
Matt: Yes. Plus five to each.
Liam: That one hits.
Laura: That's good. That hits. That one doesn't.
Matt: 23 hits.
Laura: Ooh! Then one other attack hits.
Matt: So two hits. All right. So that is--
Laura: So those would be, like, one beak and one talon maybe?
Matt: It would be one beak and one talon, yeah. Go for it. So 1d6 plus three and then 2d6 plus three.
Laura: Nine for one on the eyeballs.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: And eight on the talons.
Matt: Not bad. Both streaking out and clawing heavily at the dragon. It's bothered by it very remotely. It's more distracted with the sharp pain in its stomach.
Laura: Eyeballs.
Matt: Well yeah, I mean, they're striking at it, they don't go straight for the eyeballs, the dragon goes here, hit. They're getting near it and scraping it, the scales around it, it's moving its horns around and batting them away. If you wanted to make called shots for its eyes specifically, none of those would've hit. Outside of a natural 20, none of them would've hit. And even a dragon's eyes have pretty decent armor.
Laura: That's cool, okay, good to know.
Matt: So Percy, you're up. Oh, we've lost audio on Percy.
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: Text us your move.
Taliesin: No, I'm good.
Matt: What are you doing?
Taliesin: All right. I'm taking two shots. That's all I got left.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Here we go. 23?
Matt: 23 hits.
Taliesin: Ah! Hm. Ah. Okay. That's, eee, (broken audio).
Travis: Say that again, Perce.
Taliesin: 20, 24 points of damage.
Matt: Nice.
Taliesin: Six of which are necrotic. I'm taking my second shot.
Matt: All right. Reload, second shot.
Taliesin: Reload, fire. Fuck my life. That's m--(audio glitches)
Matt: Misfire? Oh no. Bad News just (muffled explosion).
Taliesin: Putting it away, pulling out the other gun.
Matt: All right, so that's the end of your turn?
Taliesin: That's the end of my turn.
Matt: All right. Noja actually is getting scared, yeah. Noja is actually hiding behind the tree and is shaking now, his body, malnourishment that whole time and this dragon taking all of these blows and is still standing has gotten to his head. Umbrasyl is going to look around in the vicinity, you know, starting to show some wear and tear and some serious damage to it now. And it's going to go into a dive. As it does so, you watch as the rod hits the edge of the body and tears through the stomach.
Liam: Damage.
Matt: And tears through the abdomen and out the side of it. The immovable rod now shoots out the side of its body.
Marisha: That's going to be a lot of damage, right?
Liam: That's a fuckin' missile.
Matt: That is 37 points of piercing damage as it ejects from the side. He is going to--
Travis: I'm still attached to him, too.
Matt: Correct. As you are pulled up, let's see here.
Travis: I'm going for a ride.
Marisha: We burned through all of his legendary saves.
Sam: One more.
Liam: You're attached to him? By a chain?
Travis: Yup.
Matt: You, Grog, are now being lifted up. Make a strength check.
Travis: Advantage on this. 24.
Matt: 24, yeah. Umbrasyl lifts up and goes full flying speed of 80 feet this way, carrying you dangling beneath and is going to go into a dash and continue to fly up towards Gatshadow.
Sam: (terrified laughter)
Liam: He's scared.
Matt: With Scanlan and Vax inside him still.
Liam: Work that broom, girl!
Matt: Grog dangling from beneath. And that's where we're going to pick up the next one. (yelling)
Matt: It's midnight!
Travis: Three of us are not here next week.
Matt: Three of you are not here-- That's right. Do you guys want to keep going then?
Liam: Yes!
Travis: It's either that or--
Matt: Or you're going to have to wait two weeks.
Travis: We're not here.
Laura: What do you guys think? Would you rather wait two weeks?
Liam: I want to go.
Laura: I mean, this is you guys, too. You guys have to stay.
Sam: You want to go, keep going?
Liam: Keep going.
Sam: It could be a long night.
Ashley: Who's not here next week?
Travis: Laura, Travis, and Sam.
Matt: Yeah, we're probably going to take off next week because we're missing half the party.
Sam: Oh, so we'll just skip next week and come back in two weeks.
Liam: No, it's on us, because we have jobs and getting up in the morning.
Matt: Yeah, we have work tomorrow.
Sam: Why don't we skip next week and come back in two weeks to finish?
Laura: I feel like that's smarter.
Matt: All right, let's do that.
Liam: You're leaving me in this thing's anus for two weeks?
Travis: That 30 minutes fucked us.
Matt: Picking up in two weeks from now. (yelling)
Marisha: This is awful.
Sam: The worst cliffhanger ever.
Matt: We have the remnants of the Herd and most of Vox Machina left behind as Umbrasyl flies off to the peaks of Gatshadow, dragging a large chain-held Grog beneath and a miniaturized Vax and Scanlan inside of its body.
Liam: Yeah, but I'm holding an arrow that's half in and out of the dragon. So I've got a little tunnel out.
Marisha: Make a little breathing hole?
Sam: I see a hole that goes to the outside now.
Travis: It's the shaft of an arrow.
Taliesin: This is chaos. I will see you guys later. I can't hear anything.
Marisha: Bye, Taliesin! We love you!
Matt: Oh man, this is going to get real interesting.
Sam: How are we going to survive two weeks thinking about this? I know what we'll do! We'll subscribe to Loot Crate and we'll find all sorts of things to keep us-- We'll be able to play with new toys and drink from-- (laughing)
Travis: Made me drop my fucking jelly bean.
Laura: That went south. That went seriously south.
Sam: We're not doing well.
Travis: We're doing great.
Matt: You guys did pretty good. Dragon's taken some damage.
Liam: Is it two Thursdays from now yet?
Matt: No, but it will be soon. All right, guys. We'll figure out what we're doing next Thursday. It might be another Q&A hangout session for those of us who are still in town.
Liam: Son of a b.
Ashley: Why are you guys going?
Marisha: Are you still going to be in Puerto Rico that long? No?
Travis: No.
Matt: They got birthday events and travel to do. It's all good. We'll be back here in two weeks, back here next week for probably a Q&A hangout session, two weeks from now with the dramatic conclusion of the showdown with Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer, member of the Chroma Conclave.
Liam: Matt, if you were wondering what to get me for my birthday, it's to kill my character in two weeks.
Laura: No! That is so terrible. Don't say that.
Matt: (laughs) That's awful.
Marisha: Such a death wish.
Liam: Kill me.
Laura: No.
Marisha: Hope Devourer. Maiden name Hope. Maiden name Hope.
Liam: The dragon's name is Hope.
Matt: We'll see you in a few weeks? Well, some of us will see you next week. Rest well, dream of flying dragons digesting smaller people. (laughs) See you guys soon. Is it Thursday yet? Good night.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Taliesin: Pissblossom.
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where Taliesin jumps the gun and says his phrase too late.
Travis: Way too late, man! Way too late!
Matt: Welcome. Happy to be back. Very emotional episode last week. We're going to kick it into the next step of Vox Machina's adventure this week, and then, me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be gone next week, so there will not be progression in this current storyline. However, Liam O'Brien over there has been cracking up an awesome one-shot adventure for our remaining players and a few guests. Liam, if you want to talk a little about it?
Liam: Yeah, I'll tell you who's coming on by. Sure, I'll say who's coming on by. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Ashly Burch. And I don't want to spoil it, but Matt knows. It's different.
Matt: Yeah, it's going to be fun. This is Liam's brainchild, and I'm excited to see them play through it.
Liam: It could blow up in my face.
Matt: I think you'll be fine. If the last game was any indication, I think you'll be fine. All right, other announcements: once again, we have our wonderful sponsor with a new theme kicking in. Sam, you want to take this away?
Sam: Yes, I do, Matt Mercer. Guys  Loot Crate. Loot Crate has been such a great sponsor all year long, and we got another great week to share with you. Speed is this month's theme of the Loot Crate. I'm going to read this script first. Lace up your sneakers or rev your engines. September's all about speed. Feel the adrenaline with some of pop culture's quickest vehicles and characters. High-octane assortment of goodies from Batman, the Flash, the Arrow, the Battlestar Galactica, the Iron Man, the Gone in the Sixty the Seconds. (laughter)
Sam: It includes two collectibles, a figure, and as always, a monthly t-shirt. I'm wearing a t-shirt. Not from this month, but from last month.
Laura: It's got Futurama stuff on it.
Sam: Guys, I'm an actor. Why would you listen to me about this stuff? I'm a liar and a deceiver. But what you can listen to, and what you know in your heart, is hardcore facts. I'm talking statistics. I'm talking math. I've broken this down for you guys. If you use the promo-code CriticalRole, you'll get $3 off your first month. Doesn't sound like a lot, you think? Oh, that's 1.2 gallons of gas at the Quik Mart down the street. Regular, unleaded. Or let's say you're generous. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your family. That's four Loot Crates; that's $12. That is 25 and half Forever stamps that you've just gotten for free. For free! Let's say you're more generous than that. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your whole company. All 266 employees. You've just saved enough money to buy a 2002 Kia Sedona with 181,000 miles on it. The transmission is going out, and it doesn't shift in the higher gears, but it is for $800 on Craigslist. Go look for it right now, and it will be yours for free, essentially, if you buy 266 subscriptions to Loot Crate. 266.67. Okay, that is hardcore facts. You can't argue with that. Go out. Subscribe now. Save money. Get stamps and gas.
Liam: If you don't slow your roll, Loot Crate is going to poach you.
Matt: All right, thank you, Sam.
Sam: Don't forget to use the promo code CriticalRole.
Matt: Perfect. (laughs) All right, other announcements that we have. Let's see. Projects that have come up. They recently announced and put up the English cast video for Final Fantasy XV. I have the pleasure of playing Cor Leonis. It's a lot of fun. As a longtime Final Fantasy fan, being a part of this means a great deal, and I'm excited for the game that comes out in November. So if you haven't checked out the video, do so and you can watch me wax poetic briefly about my love of the series. Look forward to that.
Marisha: Soundbiting it up in that.
Matt: Yeah, man! They chose my soundbite for the end of it. I was like (explosion). Felt cool about that.
Marisha: It's like you're an actor.
Matt: It's like I played a bunch of them. Also, Deus Ex came out. Mankind Divided. I am scattered throughout the game with a very harsh Russian, Eastern European dialect, as many characters, probably yelling at you or being shot in the face. So enjoy that, as well.
Travis: I love shooting you in the face.
Matt: Hey, you know? Everyone's got a skillset. Anybody else have anything they want to announce?
Sam: We're nominated for an award, Matt.
Matt: That's right! We just got nominated for a Streamy. A Streamy award under gaming. Games. It's awesome!
Sam: It's our first nomination.
Taliesin: It's like the Kids' Choice Awards for adults.
Laura: But it's not. Fans don't get to vote.
Matt: It is now decided by whatever the Illuminati Streamy committee is.
Sam: Wait, fans don't get to vote? I'm sure they can influence things.
Marisha: Well, they nominated us, so we got this far because of them, and now we lose to Markiplier.
Matt: Love you, Mark. We're just excited to be in that ring. Thank you guys for being so awesome and supporting us, and hopefully some of us will get to dress up fancy and show up and go home proud that we went.
Taliesin: We'll plug our other friends who are also nominated.
Matt: And Muzzled the Musical, which I co-created, which Ashly Burch stars in, who you'll see next week, that got nominated for best indie.
Marisha: And Sean Becker. Who's my director for Signal Boost. All in the fam.
Matt: It's good. Awesome. Anything else you guys want to talk about?
Travis: Yes! In the world of sportsball, the 2016 future Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys are playing the Seattle Seahawks right now! So if you see me looking down, it's not because I'm not paying attention. I'm watching football.
Taliesin: I have never cared so much about football in my entire life as I do right now. Which is saying, I don't necessarily care a lot. But definitely--
Laura: More than it was.
Travis: Everybody send Sam a tweet. He's going to be crying at the outset of his team. Sam, a moment of silence.
Taliesin: I think he's lighting the set on fire.
Laura: Sam walked away so he wouldn't be on the same set as you were saying that.
Matt: Anyone else have anything they want to talk about before we jump into the game?
Taliesin: No announcements until I get back, I think.
Matt: All righty. That being the case, then let's go ahead and hop into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back. So to get you guys caught up: our band of adventurers, Vox Machina, in raising an army, hopefully, of allies and powerful artifacts to face the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of powerful, dangerous chromatic dragons that have been tearing through the countryside of Tal'Dorei and distant Wildemount. They have recently found some information, had a close call with the Frigid Doom known as Vorugal. The white dragon flyover did not pierce through the illusionary barrier that was placed with the help of Allura, Gilmore, and Pike, there in Whitestone. You then decided to go ahead and using that cue, before the dragon returned to its current roost that it has created over the ruins of the city of Draconia, you traveled across to the continent of Wildemount. You had a meeting with the Ravenites, a rather subverted, long-enslaved offshoot species of dragonborn kin, tailless and now surviving amongst a recent winter that seems to have come with the ruin the dragon brought. You also discovered that most of Draconia and its royal elite have been slaughtered as a means of the dragon establishing its dominance and the worship of the Ravenites that survived the fall of Draconia. You made a deal with Tooma, the current clan leader of the remaining Ravenites, that you would aid in destroying this dragon, basically the master that they replaced the Draconians with when it came. However, to ensure your help there was a two-week time limit, and if you do not return before then they would see you as not keeping your end of the deal, and they would then, instead, direct the dragon towards what was going to be Whitestone until you altered her memory, which she recalls now as Emon. Anyway, before you could be finding your way home, one of the corpses upon one of the ice spire spikes outside of the dragon's new nest, Percy saw to be the remains of your long-traveled friend, Tiberius Stormwind. The party had a fateful farewell; set him to rest within the ruins of the nearby library, fallen from the islands of Draconia; said your goodbyes; and then, upon prepping a bit, plotting, and planning, found your way back to Whitestone to continue the next leg of your adventure. And that is where we begin. You have now taken some time in your own respective rooms. It's still late afternoon, going into dusk. You all took some time to yourselves within Castle Whitestone to take a short rest and ruminate over these recent events and reveals. The evening sun draws close to dusk. It is your choice which you wish to do. If you wish to spend the evening resting here and then leaving first thing in the morning, that is up to you.
Liam: Taking the initiative. This one came to my room, then inside. I think we've probably been quiet for a while, staring at the ceiling, and after a while finally say: We've really fucked things up, haven't we?
Marisha: In which particular way do you mean, aside from all of them?
Liam: I need to tell you. I know with all that's happened, between my new patron and my sister pretending to gag literally every time we attempt to share a word together, and mostly my own being fucked up in the head for weeks now, that I've pushed all of you away. You most of all. Because I've been afraid you would-- I'm sorry. And you didn't deserve any of that. Keyleth, I need you to know, through all of that, everything, nothing has changed about how I-- We've had so many near-misses. And now, finding Tiberius. Death is unavoidable. And it's all the more reason for life to be lived. And it doesn't matter to me what this is. What we call it. If you are willing to spend some time, any time, with me, then I will simply count myself lucky to have it. You're very dear to me.
Marisha: You're talking too much. It's not like I've made myself very accessible either. It's not on you. It might be a little on you, but it's on both of us. Anyway, my point is: for the longest time, I was terrified that I was going to lose you. First to death and then to the Raven Queen, which is still kind of like death, and then ultimately to yourself. And then I had an interesting talk with Pike recently, and she said something that really stood out to me, and that was that some people just have more of themselves to give. And I realized this whole time that I was afraid of losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet been written, which is stupid.
Liam: Maybe so.
Marisha: But you're ultimately right. We have nothing to lose. I love you, Vax. And I'm sorry for being me, that it took me this long to say it.
Liam: (sniffles) I'm sorry.
Marisha: Yeah. Me, too.
Liam: I love you. That's pretty fucking great.
Marisha: That is pretty great, yeah. High five. Yeah!
Liam: I tackle her into a bit of a hug into the bed.
Laura: Oh!
Liam: We're already on the bed.
Marisha: And that's it for now.
Sam: Pan to the fireplace.
Travis: (laughing) Pan to the fireplace!
Matt: All right, so. Vox Machina. Taking your time to mourn in your own interesting ways. What is your path of action? What is your course, going forward?
Liam: Sleeping in.
Marisha: Bacon.
Laura: Yeah, I think we need to spend at least the night in Whitestone and get up in the morning.
Matt: Okay. So you've all spent the majority of it in your respective rooms-- most of you in your respective rooms-- figuring out where you are as a person and where this story leads you. After an evening's rest, the next morning comes around, breakfast is already prepared by the servants in the castle, though maybe not the amount of bacon you were hoping, and easily rectified upon request. It's at your disposal. There is a tension in the city; the barrier remains up. As you're having breakfast, you can see Zahra wander in at the smell of bacon, glances over the rest of you, still holding a book at her side that she slams closed. "Oh. I'm glad to see you're all right, and you're safe. Please tell me there's more bacon."
Travis: Not for long.
Laura: There's more coming, dear.
Travis: What she said.
Matt: She comes and sits down and spends breakfast with you guys, catching up on what has transpired and what your current plan of action is.
Taliesin: Zahra, it occurs to me, you come from a family with power, connections.
Matt: "Kind of. Let's just say we're estranged at the moment."
Taliesin: Well, we're looking for any ally we could, and we were curious if--
Matt: "You will find no allies where you're asking. Believe me, I'd be happy to offer if we could, but no."
Taliesin: I had a feeling. It just felt worth asking.
Matt: "It's all right. I'm going to continue with my research, since the rest of the ziggurat clan are now scattered about or maintaining that barrier. Guess who has to do the research in the meantime?" And she rolls her sleeves up; you can see the slightly smudged dirt across her reddish skin. She's been hard at work digging around trying to figure out what the basis of this enchantment beneath the city still is.
Laura: Sorry you can't be out having your fun, dear.
Matt: "I'm certain time will allow me at some point. It better. I'm going a little stir-crazy." She grabs the bacon from the table and walks out of the room.
Taliesin: Is Kashaw around by any chance, as well?
Matt: "I'm sorry, what?"
Taliesin: Kashaw. Is Kashaw around?
Matt: "I haven't seen him for a couple days. I've been underground most of the time."
Taliesin: Yes, of course. We have to send a letter to the Slayer's Take at some point. That should happen sooner rather than later.
Marisha: Trying to wrangle a beast?
Taliesin: Trying to wrangle a beast or seeing if they know of anything that's in the vicinity that we can at least feed to it in the meantime.
Laura: Maybe we can stop through on our way back. We are going to Marquet, aren't we?
Taliesin: I would hope so.
Marisha: And what's our intent in Marquet? To get the next Vestige?
Taliesin: To get to the next Vestige and to perhaps make some friends. The more the merrier.
Liam: And the means of travel is?
Taliesin: We have a sigil. We can teleport.
Laura: Gilmore. Gilmore's from Marquet.
Taliesin: This is a teleport sigil. This is not going to require his attention.
Marisha: Yeah, it's located in Whitestone Castle, correct? The teleport sigil?
Matt: It's actually a sigil by memory that he has, and it's a spell that he casts. It's not a permanent fixture in the city.
Taliesin: So we need him, but he can do it.
Sam: Yeah, but he's concentrating on the defensive wall right now.
Laura: It's up. As long as the dragon's not here and attacking.
Matt: It's a renewal feature. He has to spend some time each day maintaining it. He's not stuck there the whole time.
Sam: That would be awesome.
Taliesin: The worst job in Whitestone.
Sam: Before we go to Marquet. Let's say Marquet takes 13 days.
Taliesin: That's an awful long time.
Sam: I agree, but let's say it does. Do we know what we're doing with regards to Draconia when we come back? Do we have some sort of a plan? We're getting a beast. That's all we know.
Travis: Yep, we've got it covered. It's planned out to a T.
Laura: How are we even going to get a beast?
Taliesin: Talk to the Slayer's Take and see what is already on the continent.
Sam: What constitutes a beast? Because me and Keyleth can make some beasts.
Laura: I think a large enough beast to attract Vorugal.
Sam: Like a triceratops?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: They said it hunted something really intense recently.
Laura: He said they hunted remorhaz?
Marisha: Yeah, they went to the ocean.
Sam: What is that?
Matt: Roll an intelligence check.
Marisha: But I wrote it down.
Sam: For me. Ooh, a 19! Plus two.
Matt: That's what they look like.
Laura: Oh. Those are big and scary.
Sam: Is it a gargantuan monster?
Matt: They're huge. Most definitely. They're nasty; they burrow. The actual blood within their body is heated to such a degree that even to be in a scuffle with it is to scar yourself with flame and heat.
Sam: And it was bored with that?
Taliesin: We want to find a creature that would threaten a medium-sized city.
Marisha: So it wants competition.
Taliesin: We want to wear it down a bit before we go in for the attack. We want it to be breathing heavily.
Sam: And how are we going to get this creature there?
Taliesin: We're going to find something that's already on the continent.
Laura: And Vorugal will go to the creature.
Taliesin: He will be happy to attack it.
Travis: Can you put it in your necklace?
Sam: On the continent. What continent? The Draconian continent?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: So we have to go back there to search!
Marisha: The Slayer's Take should know. They've got contracts everywhere.
Sam: All right. This is slightly a better plan than I thought.
Marisha: We thought about it a little.
Taliesin: Six people cannot wage a war.
Sam: Then we should go talk to the Slayer's Take now so they can get started on this hunt.
Taliesin: We're going to send them a letter.
Sam: A letter?!
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Who's the letter carrier and how's he going to get out of this city that's protected by an invisible wall?
Taliesin: We're going to make Kashaw take the letter.
Liam: When we were last there, hadn't they talked about a brass or bronze dragon? But there are brass dragons, as you well know.
Laura: I know, because I'm an expert.
Liam: Is that overkill? We'd have to convince a dragon, not capture a dragon.
Taliesin: It would probably kill the dragon.
Marisha: Wait, are we talking about capturing another dragon to fight another dragon?
Sam: No, we're talking about convincing a dragon to go fight this dragon that would clearly kill it.
Taliesin: I was going to find Kashaw and see if he would run the letter to the Slayer's Take and be our emissary and convince them to do this so that we're not doing everything ourselves.
Sam: Wait, is there anyone else who can make this message delivery faster or safer?
Taliesin: Literally everyone. If we could find a child in a pub who could take it.
Sam: No, but faster and safer.
Taliesin: Kashaw is possibly slower than a child.
Marisha: No more small boys, Percy. No more.
Laura: We could ask Zahra, but she's busy with research.
Travis: I think Kashaw is a great people-person.
Taliesin: Just to get rid of him, they would say yes.
Sam: All right.
Liam: He wants to help. He does.
Laura: Yeah. Let's go find Kashaw.
Matt: You guys head outside of Castle Whitestone. Not far from the base of the pathway into the actual city, you can see there is a series of newer-outfitted guards. They are people being trained in the force of combat. You can see that there's definitely a ramping-up of the defense force for Whitestone as a precaution.
Marisha: Do they look like townspeople?
Matt: Many of them look able-bodied and people that are strong and fit, but they do appear to be civilians that have had to take up the cause just in case.
Marisha: Any kids?
Matt: No kids, no. They all look to be at least of strapping age, to be carrying a weapon.
Sam: Strapping boys?
Taliesin: Strapping. The strapping age.
Laura: Did we ever talk to Cassandra or anyone else about starting an alarm system here?
Sam: Yeah, and they were working on it already, weren't they?
Taliesin: No, they started. They are working on it now.
Sam: I think it's done.
Taliesin: I'd buy that. Yes, it was proposed.
Marisha: I do want to maybe talk to Gilmore, though.
Taliesin: Well, we're going to have to if we leave the city, anyway.
Matt: As you are watching the group go through their different weapon practice moments, they're breaking off into small sparring groups and they're going up against ramshackle built training dummies. There are a few that are doing forms in succession. (grunts) You know the deal. You do see on the opposite end that the person who is currently helming one section of the training is Kashaw. You can see a bunch of shield and spear fighters right now, and he's basically giving them instruction on how to use a shield defensively and the spear offensively simultaneously.
Laura: Maybe he's not the best messenger if he's training our armies.
Taliesin: This is not an army. This is something for the population to do while they pass time. The dragon shows up, they're all going to die, no matter how many times they learn how to put the spear forward.
Marisha: As cynical as Percy is being right now, he's right.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: But it doesn't mean that Kashaw is going to think that it's any less important, and I'm sure he might not take it as a compliment if we ask him to be the messenger boy.
Sam: It's an incredibly important mission!
Laura: It's not just a messenger, it's defeating a dragon.
Taliesin: And it's convincing the Slayer's Take to join.
Sam: The Slayer's Take, if I recall, doesn't do things for free. We're going to have to pay for this, even though we're members.
Taliesin: We're going to have to bring them some dragon parts.
Laura: No, we take a contract on a really large creature, and then we let the dragon do the work for us. We get the best of both worlds.
Taliesin: Ooh, that's very clever.
Sam: We take a contract on an existing creature that we have to somehow find in Draconia.
Travis: No, we bring the dragon to the creature.
Sam: How?
Laura: He hunts them. That's what he does.
Sam: Not transcontinentally.
Travis: You can't broker a fight between a huge beast and a white dragon?
Taliesin: We could sell tickets.
Travis: I think you've done better.
Liam: We don't necessarily have to sacrifice a dragon. We're fighting a war here. They're fuckers.
Sam: No, we're not talking about sacrificing a dragon. We're talking about finding a beast.
Liam: Well, I'm talking about a dragon. Couldn't we try to talk a dragon into helping us do what we're doing? They're not all evil, are they? They're not!
Marisha: Yeah, but do we know of any other dragons here?
Laura: Well, then we're going to have to fucking go to the Slayer's Take.
Travis: Can we go somewhere in the next 60 seconds?
Laura: This'll be great.
Marisha: Let's talk to Kashaw. We go up and we talk to Kashaw.
Matt: As you approach, you see him leaning in with younger, early twenties-looking men. A bit scrawny; they're still armored; the helmet looks a little lopsided. Kashaw's like, "You're not supposed to put the shield away. (sighs) Oh, wonderful. Take five. Take 30. So. You're alive. That's great. I'm excited. What can I do for you?"
Taliesin: Kashaw, how would you like to be anywhere else other than here right now?
Matt: "Depends on where and what you'd have me doing."
Taliesin: That's exactly the sort of enthusiasm I was hoping for. We have need of an emissary to the Slayer's Take. We need to convince them to help us kill the next dragon.
Laura: And Vanessa really likes you.
Taliesin: She does.
Marisha: We need a big beast on Draconia.
Matt: "So you're saying that I go back to frozen-ass Vasselheim to deliver a paper message to the headmistress, whom already I am so happy to be away from."
Marisha: Yeah. See?
Matt: He glances over at the rest of the soldiers. "Yeah, I'll take it." (laughter)
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: We are in your debt. I'll have the paper drawn up, and anything you can do to put the weight of the situation behind us and make sure they know how clear it is and how necessary this is and how desperate we are.
Matt: "I'll do my best to muster some semblance of emphasis."
Taliesin: And we'll figure out ways to make sure there's money in it for them, or at least dragon parts.
Matt: "All right. Give me a list of what you've got to offer. I'll bring it to them."
Taliesin: Excellent.
Sam: What do we got to offer?
Liam: We don't have the troll dick anymore. That's gone.
Laura: We have 40 pounds of dragonhide. Black dragonhide.
Taliesin: And white dragonhide.
Laura: We don't have white dragonhide.
Taliesin: We have white scales.
Travis: We have 64 pounds of scales from me. We have four claws left.
Sam: I have a Tome of Leadership worth 30,000 gold.
Laura: No, that's Keyleth's, remember? In the next century, when she's still living.
Sam: We'll get it back before 100 years are up.
Marisha: I'll lend it to them for 100 years.
Sam: A 99-year lease.
Travis: And we got umber hulk pieces, too.
Taliesin: Mostly, I was thinking of also offering them whatever we can take from the dragon itself once it's destroyed.
Liam: I was about to say, yeah, we put into the contract that it has the remains of the beast we take down, which we will take down.
Taliesin: We keep some scales, we keep some teeth; we split it.
Liam: Sure, as a souvenir, right. Yes.
Marisha: We're basically doing a contract for free.
Liam: It's a very large creature.
Sam: That's provided we kill it. If we lose, they get nothing. I'm just saying, from their perspective, we're offering them literally nothing.
Marisha: If they lose, they don't lose anything either, right?
Laura: No, they do. They lose a contract.
Marisha: But wouldn't the contract just go right back into cycle?
Laura: No, if the dragon kills the creature and then we all die and we can't harvest it, the Slayer's Take doesn't have anything from its previous contract.
Liam: But that could happen with any contract. Any band of idiots could go die on the battlefield.
Marisha: They're used to having people die.
Laura: Well, fuck it.
Marisha: I think Grog's getting antsy.
Taliesin: I like this. I'm going to have it drawn up.
Liam: I look at Grog and see he's really bored. I pick up a wooden sword and I hit him as hard as I can on the small of his back.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Make a check.
Liam: It's not going to be that hard.
Laura: While all this is going on, Grog, you could be training these soldiers.
Liam: 17.
Travis: What, train them?
Matt: As you're having this conversation, (whack) right in the knee cap, a surprisingly painful and forceful blow. It's less the strength behind it and more the precision in which it strikes you right between the kneecap and the rest of the lower half of your knee.
Travis: Like when a doctor hits you and your knee jumps?
Matt: Yeah, and you're like (grunts) and you glance over and you see Vax hide a wooden sword quickly behind him as he backs away.
Liam: Come on, big guy! I know you're bored! Come on! I hit him again.
Matt: Roll a strength check. Actually, this time it's an attack roll, as well.
Marisha: Hit him in the nuts.
Liam: Okay, cool. That's a 20. Oh! But it's with a stick! Just strength modifier?
Matt: You're not proficient with a sword.
Liam: Oh dear. I'm going to use Luck. 14.
Matt: (laughs) You whack him. This time, it hits the meat of his thigh and has no effect.
Liam: I missed the nut? Ugh. Come on!
Travis: Do you have a death wish?
Liam: Come on, take a swing! I'm trying to do you a favor! Come on, get it out!
Travis: What am I missing here?
Taliesin: I'm seeing this going down. I've walked away.
Liam: I see a gauntlet on a table, and I throw it at his face.
Matt: Okay, roll an attack roll.
Liam: It's a one! (laughter)
Sam: I see this going on, and I stand up on something, and I yell to the students--
Matt: Before this happens, as you're getting up, you watch as Vax rears back, and as he throws it, (yelps) he pulls a muscle in his shoulder and it drops to the ground, and you're like (pained noises).
Laura: Seriously?
Sam: I jump up on a chair and I yell to the students: Instructor Kashaw has instructed us that this is a drill! You are to attack that man right there, that large man, as a test of your strength and training. Now!
Laura: Don't kill them, Grog!
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: Oh, this is going to be awful. Wow. That is cruel.
Sam: 34. (laughter)
Matt: You watch as roughly 45 armored soldiers all turn towards you with their shields and spears... and freeze. They all slowly look towards Scanlan and whisper among themselves, then look back at Grog and stay frozen and two creep forward for a minute. Get a little closer.
Travis: I take the Gauntlets and I smash them together, and I grow in size. (laughter)
Matt: As your form swells into your now enlarged goliath battle-ready form, you notice a few of them start giving off this rattling metal sound as their armored knees (clanging) together. Many of them step back about ten feet, and Kashaw, who hasn't left entirely, spins around and goes: "The gnome's fucking with you. It's fine!" He walks up to you, Scanlan, pats your arm and goes, "That was pretty funny."
Sam: I try.
Matt: "Don't get the people killed. I've been working on them for four days."
Sam: He wasn't going to kill-- Were you going to kill them, Grog?
Travis: Yes.
Sam: Oh shit.
Travis: I look at Vax and I go, you were just playing around, right?
Liam: Yes.
Travis: And in my giant state, I'm going to kick him like a soccer ball.
Liam: I'm going to dodge. Uncanny Dodge, man.
Matt: Well, we'll see. Go ahead and roll an attack roll.
Travis: That's good. 32.
Liam: Ooh. No, I didn't miss that.
Matt: Roll a strength check.
Liam: Wait, I'm going to use another Luck and make him roll again and pick the lower of the two.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 15 on the strength check. 25.
Liam: Got to roll again for the hit.
Matt: Roll again because he used a Luck point to force you to reroll your attack roll.
Travis: 24.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: What was the strength roll again?
Travis: The strength was 24.
Matt: Strength check was 24. So as you peek out of the corner of your eye you hear this (heavy steps) and as you try and spin and dodge out of the way instinctually--
Liam: Uncanny Dodge!
Matt: I know and we'll get to that. Instinctually, you turn to dodge out of something Grog-sized, not giant-sized. And in that brief minute that you remember that he grew, you pause just long enough to (whack) feel the force of what feels like a giant battering ram slam into your side, sending you off your feet and arcing a good 30 feet before you (impact) tumble and skid to the ground. What's your strength modifier?
Travis: Seven.
Matt: Seven. You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half because you're taking Uncanny Dodge. So only seven points bludgeoning damage. You stay there for a second, stunned. You feel a bit of bile and iron taste in the back of your throat.
Liam: And in the distance you hear  (strained) I feel so alive. (laughter)
Taliesin: First rule of Fight Club.
Travis: Can I check the Titanstone Knuckles? Have they changed now that I've kicked a friend in the face?
Matt: (laughing) Make an investigation check.
Travis: Damn it! Eight.
Matt: They appear to have maintained their composure as gauntlets.
Liam: There's some blood and five long, dark hairs on them.
Matt: You watch as a lot of the soldiers who had been watching this endeavor step even further away from Grog, and some of them begin walking off, taking their helmets off. "All right, we're done."
Laura: Hey bonus, he's on our side. Eh? That's encouraging.
Matt: They all nod their heads. "Yeah, I know that. Thank god!" But they're all doing this while still locking eyes with him. "That's great." And slowly walk off.
Travis: (chuckles)
Liam: Vex.
Laura: Yeah?
Liam: Help me up.
Laura: Don't you have wings?
Liam: Not going to use them right now. Just a hand. (groans) That's going to bruise. Worth it.
Travis: Thank you. I was getting so bored.
Liam: (sighs) I know.
Travis: Thanks, bubby.
Taliesin: What are the chances I would have at least a basic portable writing desk? They're not that complicated.
Matt: A portable writing desk?
Taliesin: 16th century-style. Just something to write on.
Marisha: What do you need a writing desk for?
Taliesin: Just something with paper, pen, and something to write on.
Matt: You have access to a quill and ink, you have access to parchment.
Liam: How about a fucking clipboard?
Taliesin: It's basically a fucking clipboard.
Matt: You have access to that, yes.
Liam: Percival de Rolo, Inventor of Clipboard.
Taliesin: No, it was called a writing desk back then. It was called a writing desk. There's a thing. It was that big and you put it on your lap. It was a writing desk.
Matt: All right. Yes, you have access to that.
Sam: So wait, what is in this letter? What are we offering them?
Marisha: Yeah, how's the letter going?
Taliesin: I'm writing the letter up. I've basically gotten it together. I've explained the situation briefly. I assume they're aware of the war and the current reality.
Sam: And to clarify for me. We're asking them--
Taliesin: I'm getting there. In this, I'm asking for their assistance in killing a dragon. For this assistance, they will get all bounty of biological remnants of the dragon, with a small percentage of scales and teeth kept for us. Asking for 20 percent, but negotiable. We want them to supply either a local or give some intel into where we can find a beast large enough for this dragon to attack. Information that we have on this dragon so that they actually help us strategize any ways of defeating it, and any other help that they could give in defeating this creature. And as a token of our goodwill, we are sending them a small package of black and white dragon scales and a dragon tooth.
Laura: Yes. And make sure to include that this must all be completed within 14 days.
Sam: But wait.
Travis: There's more.
Taliesin: There's more.
Sam: Asking them to help us kill a dragon?
Taliesin: For stuff.
Sam: No, but that's not what we're asking them. We're asking them to find a beast.
Laura: Yes, that's what he said.
Taliesin: It's in the letter.
Laura: That's part of that listening thing, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm sorry.
Liam: He did talk for quite a while.
Taliesin: Is there a way to enchant me so that I have his voice? And then he'll listen more closely?
Marisha: Yeah, actually.
Matt: He has a spell for that. (laughter)
Taliesin: Don't answer that.
Matt: As you finish penning the letter, you read over it once, twice, make sure all the information is contained. You go ahead and grab the little bit of your offering of dragon scales and teeth. Present them to Kashaw. He takes the letter and reads it over. "Sure."
Sam: Should we add an NDA?
Taliesin: There's a rider at the end of everything I send.
Laura: Kashaw. No mention of Whitestone at all. Anywhere you go. Very important.
Travis: Good addendum. Whatever that word is.
Liam: Again, please?
Laura: No mention of Whitestone.
Taliesin: No mention of Whitestone.
Laura: Do we have a way to get him there very quickly?
Marisha: What? Kashaw?
Matt: "Are you going to do your tree thing for me? Otherwise, I can walk, but it'll be a month and a half before I get to shore."
Marisha: Yeah. We're going to be here the rest of the day, right?
Sam: How will he get back?
Marisha: Druids. People. Wizards. Sorcerers.
Sam: Wait! We got those rocks.
Laura: He's a really smart man.
Taliesin: Oh, the rock. That's a really good idea.
Laura: Yeah, but then he'll pop where we are.
Taliesin: No, we'll leave the rock here.
Sam: We're going to stay here at least a day.
Liam: Well, you've got friends, don't you?
Matt: "I'm can figure something out."
Laura: Don't worry about it.
Sam: Steal an airship on your way back.
Matt: (chuckles) "No."
Marisha: All right. Let's go to the Sun Tree.
Matt: "All right." Gets his shield and his spear and walks down with Keyleth towards the Sun Tree. As he's walking down, at your side.
Laura: Don't you want to walk with them?
Liam: No. Where is that coming from?
Sam: No, he definitely has a thing for you, Vax. I have a keen eye for these things.
Liam: But you can't address it. You just have to let it be. I'm not going to encourage it. I'm not interested in him.
Taliesin: I see it every time. He does. He smolders.
Matt: As he walks with you down the pathway, having this conversation. It's that awkward, quiet about three, four minutes of walking before he goes. (sniffs) "Ugh. So when all this is over--"
Marisha: Oh, come on, man. Why are you doing this to me? (laughter)
Travis: Hold on, it's going to happen. Let it happen.
Matt: "If we survive all this dragon business--"
Marisha: Fuck you, I hate you so much right now. (laughs) Uh-huh?
Matt: "Do you want to get a drink?"
Marisha: I love drinks.
Matt: "Good."
Marisha: So much.
Matt: "Great."
Marisha: What kind of a drink?
Matt: You guys begin to approach the edge of the tree. He goes: "I think you answered your own question."
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Is that a yes?"
Marisha: Well...
Matt: "Open the damn tree."
Marisha: Look. You know. It's really complicated right now, and I'm trying this whole "allowing myself to feel things" thing.
Matt: "Yeah. It doesn't work out for anybody. Trust me."
Marisha: Oh man. I don't know how to respond to that. I'll see you on the other side. We'll put a pin on this one. Bye, Kash. And I cast it through the tree and I push him in.
Matt: "All right, then. We'll just-- hey!" And you push him through the tree. Shuts behind him. You're left there alone, standing in the cold Whitestone air outside of the Sun Tree. Around mid-morning.
Sam: Did Kash leave already?
Marisha: Yeah, he's gone.
Sam: Aw, Vax, you didn't get a chance to say anything to him. I've talked to him about this. He has his eyes out on you.
Liam: I've got enough complications around me as it is.
Sam: I'm a really good reader of people.
Liam: It's true.
Sam: The dark eyeliner--
Laura: So now that that's handled, are we leaving today?
Taliesin: Oh, we're leaving today.
Sam: Well, one of us doesn't have any luck left, so maybe we should spend the night.
Liam: I've got a little bit of luck. I'm a lucky guy.
Taliesin: We'll get our luck back tomorrow.
Laura: We've got a limited amount of time on this.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way towards the building that has recently been essentially given to and is acting as the abode for Shaun Gilmore while he's here in Whitestone. As you come to the front door, the door's closed. You knock. (knocking) No response.
Liam: Shaun? Shaun! It's us. Are you home?
Matt: You hear a muffled voice in the distance within the building go, "Yeah, hold on."
Laura: Did it sound like anyone we knew?
Matt: It sounded like Gilmore. He's under some sort of duress.
Marisha: Sounded like he was under duress?
Matt: Slightly.
Laura: Is everything okay?
Matt: "Yes. Hold on, please." And you watch as the barrier flickers for a second and restores itself, almost like a wave of energy brought what was a slowly dwindling bit of the blue energy, now restored to its full strength.
Travis: He's got to use the privy at some point.
Sam: Yeah, he's probably squeezing one out. It's okay.
Matt: A moment passes before the door opens again and you see Gilmore there, beads of sweat down the front of his face. He's got his fuzzy purple-blue robe wrapped around him. "My sincerest apologies, I had to take care of the now morning ritual."
Laura: How are you holding up, Gilmore?
Matt: "I'm fine. This is child's play compared to what you're having to deal with on a daily basis, I'm sure."
Marisha: Can I do an insight check?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: 15.
Laura: Oh! You got a whisper on a 15.
Sam: This is an early whisper. A first-hour whisper is rare.
Taliesin: It came at such a high speed. I wish it came so quickly.
Liam: I wish I knew more about Loot Crate right now.
Sam: Well, it's not just Loot Crate, Liam. It's Loot Wear. Those come in a separate bag.
Liam: Different than Loot Crate?
Sam: Yeah, it's different. You can find out all about it at lootcrate.com/criticalrole.
Laura: Actually, the shirt you're wearing, Sam, is from Loot Wear.
Sam: What? It is? Oh my god! And I'm so handsome.
Taliesin: Anyway, back to the game.
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Laura: Well, we plan to go to Marquet. Things have progressed much quicker than we expected it to, and unfortunately we are on a two-week time crunch before all hell breaks loose.
Matt: "Well, at the very least, that gives us a series of days to make the best of the time we have. So Marquet it is. All right. Come in." He closes his robe a little bit and walks in, and you enter. You can see there's a half-drunken tea set, and he begins to walk past. "Tea, anyone?"
Sam: I'd like a loose-leaf oolong, please.
Matt: "I'll do what I can."
Taliesin: How many cups are currently sitting with the teapot?
Matt: Currently, there is one cup, but as he walks by, he does this with his fingers and you watch as multiple cups drift off the shelf and find their way (cups landing) on the table.
Laura: How does his house look? Does it look together like it would normally be, or does it look disheveled at all?
Matt: It looks a little disheveled, but also it hasn't been too long since the assassination attempt on him and he threw his attacker into the far wall, but it looks like the furniture has been placed up. There are still some bits and pieces of broken things here and there, but for the most part it doesn't look like he's had lot of time to clean up other than just making it functional. It seems livable; it's not too bad. He goes into the kitchen. He comes back out a moment later with a fresh pot of hot tea and sets it down. "All right. So this isn't going to send you to where you're going--"
Sam: We literally know nothing about Marquet.
Matt: "It's hot. It's dry. Bring some water if you can."
Liam: You're not able to leave, are you?
Matt: "I should not. Got to keep this going until Allura comes back."
Sam: Is there anyone that we can say maybe vouches for us or someone who we are against so that we can win favor with the locals? Something like a no-tail, long-tail binary.
Liam: We walked into a sort of political snafu because we didn't know the lay of the land, so is there anything we should know in advance?
Matt: "Best I can tell you, because I haven't been there since I was very young, one: this going to send you not to Ank'Harel itself, it's going to send you to Shandal, which is a small oasis village a little ways south of Ank'Harel. It's where I grew up."
Liam: What was that name again?
Matt: "Shandal."
Liam: Shandal.
Matt: "I will say that it has been about 15 years, so I don't quite know what to expect there. I apologize in advance for any ensuing chaos, but it's a nice town. It's small, it's sleepy. It's not my speed. Hence why I came here. However, in Marquet, it's mostly music, culture, fun people, good food. Don't break the laws. Don't drink the water freely from the various channels you may stumble across. Water there is a commodity. It is controlled and sold throughout the city."
Liam: We got a jug.
Travis: We got loads.
Matt: "Those are the main things I can think of. I don't know what else you're really looking for there."
Sam: Well, I can tell you.
Taliesin: Cabal's Ruin.
Sam: Thank you.
Taliesin: The Den of Druja.
Marisha: The Den of Druja.
Marisha: Druyah. Drujah?
Taliesin: Druhah.
Marisha: Jaja.
Taliesin: Thanks.
Matt: "I don't know anything about that, unfortunately, but most folks that have information are eager to give what they know with a little coin to grease the palm."
Taliesin: Or a little water.
Matt: "Depends on who you're talking to. Anything else?"
Liam: No, go ahead.
Matt: He pours tea for everyone else who asked for it. And for each person that asked for a different flavor of tea, he begins to snap his fingers and the tea color changes.
Laura: We are looking for a merchant warrior. Outside of you, do you know of any very powerful merchants?
Matt: "There are many."
Laura: One with a missing eye?
Matt: "That would definitely probably narrow it down, but none that I can remember off the top of my head."
Sam: Why don't we bring Jarett with us? Is that a thing?
Laura: We should talk to him.
Sam: Okay. Shaun, you do so much for us. We do nothing for you. Is there anything we can bring back for you or messages to give to someone there?
Liam: Is there anyone you haven't seen in all these years?
Matt: "When you meet them, and you'll know who they are, tell them I say hello. And actually--" He thinks to himself for a second. Rushes off. Comes back with a small backpack made of leather and thick, light tan wool. He opens it up and reaches inside. Pulls out a small silver locket and takes it and puts it in your hand, Vex. He goes, "Just give that to them."
Laura: To them?
Matt: He closes the bag and places it back in the other room.
Marisha: Shaun, are you doing okay? You look a little worn out.
Matt: (sighs) "We do what we must."
Marisha: I could only imagine a barrier of this size of a construct can be quite taxing on one's physical energy.
Matt: "Yes. I guess if I had one request of all of you, this goes universally, can we end this dragon business soon? Please? I really just want to set up shop again."
Liam: We would like nothing more. I think we're on the same page.
Matt: "Great."
Laura: We're very interested to start paying you for your service again, Gilmore, and stop expecting it for free.
Matt: "Good. Because I've been keeping a tally. I don't know about you guys, but the tab is running very deep."
Laura: Oh, believe me. I have, as well. This locket will take a nice little chunk off of that tally.
Matt: "Fantastic. I love it."
Liam: Birds of a feather, you two.
Sam: Should we go talk to Jarett and then come back?
Taliesin: Let's go talk to Jarett. We'll have appropriate clothing set up and prepare ourselves for the trip.
Sam: Robes and things?
Matt: "I'll be here if you need me."
Laura: Thank you.
Sam: We'll be back in an hour.
Matt: "All right. You don't want the rest of your tea?"
Sam: Oh. I'll drink it.
Laura: Do you have any to-go cups? (laughs) Just kidding.
Matt: "These didn't belong to me, so please, take them if you want." (laughter)
Matt: He transitions the tea over into a couple of cups and hands them off to you guys who haven't finished. You head out. As you're leaving, you see Sherri coming up. Her hair's a bit tattered. She's usually more put together when she runs the shop. Now she's in casual Sherri mode. Her hair is frazzled and pulled back. Her glasses are pushed to the end of her nose, and she's carrying a bundle of groceries, various bits of produce and such. "Oh, hello, everyone. I'm bringing Gilmore his breakfast."
Liam: Sherri. We asked him, but he's modest. How's he doing?
Matt: "Not that he'd tell me anything, but he doesn't have a very lengthy period of keeping this up without him probably collapsing like he did back in the city. Just please, try to do your best to get this over with. I'm worried. At the very least, until Allura comes back. At least they can share the load. All right." She knocks on the door and opens it. "Gilmore? Gilmore, breakfast." The door closes behind her.
Travis: Hey, I have an idea.
Sam: Oh boy.
Travis: I know, it's thrilling. We need eight gallon wine skins or bottles or jugs. Because the Alchemy Jug can make out eight gallons of fresh water. We pour it all out and then at the end of the day it starts over, so we have eight gallons sitting in the bag.
Taliesin: In theory, we all have water skins, don't we?
Marisha: We should have a spread of our survival kits.
Liam: But all the same, that is a very good idea, Grog.
Laura: I'm surprised you even know how many eight gallons is, Grog.
Travis: Yeah, eight gallons.
Sam: But if we had an extra skin or something, we could trade it. We could give it away, so we should go get one, yeah?
Travis: Yeah, we could give it away, give it away, give it away now.
Laura: Wow. I walk off and look for Jarett.
Liam: A rift just opened in the universe.
Matt: It doesn't take you long. He is still stationed as one of the central figures guarding the actual castle of Whitestone itself. Similar to the place you saw him last time you guys had a conversation walking up to the castle. He stands there with his crossbow at the ready, giving a long view over the surrounding valley before he watches you approach. "Friends, you have returned. I hope all is well on your end. Can I be of service?"
Laura: You can tell us all about where you're from, actually. Did you leave Marquet a long time ago?
Matt: "It was maybe ten, nine years ago, and it was not under the best terms. Probably would be in jail had I not got away."
Laura: Oh, really?
Matt: "They are not very forgiving of broken laws there, and based on certain judgments... let's just say a slap on the wrist usually takes the wrist with it."
Laura: What did you do?
Matt: (sighs) "Whatever was needed for survival."
Liam: Well, we're going there, so I'm hoping either you can give us a lot of tips so we don't run into problems, or I don't know if anyone can take your place right now. Do you want to go on a field trip?
Matt: "To Ank'Harel?"
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: "No!" (laughter)
Matt: "I'm sorry, I respect this. I think my strength and skill set is much better used here than in the Scarlet Prison beneath the Cerulean Palace. I do not want to even conjecture spending the rest of my life there, or in pieces. Also possible."
Liam: Forget it. We need all the knowledge in your head, in ours.
Marisha: Yeah, what was that Scarlet Prison you just mentioned, under the what now?
Matt: "The Cerulean Palace. The Cerulean Palace is where the Hand of Ord generally keeps most justice, where most of the courts are kept. It is also where the Tower of J'mon Sa Ord is maintained for watching over the entire city, and most of that eastern side of Marquet. The Scarlet Prison is where people go to disappear. It is also referred to as the Scarlet Oubliette. People are placed there to go away; people are placed there to be tortured; people are placed there, rumors say, to be part of various experiments. Regardless, I would highly recommend--" He looks to you. "Don't steal anything unless you are damn sure nobody knows of it."
Liam: I haven't stolen anything in years.
Travis: (coughing) Bullshit.
Laura: Me neither. (laughs nervously)
Marisha: I've never stolen anything!
Laura: Have you heard about the Den of Drujah. Drujah.
Matt: He closes his eyes a second. "That was... a very, very--"
Laura: It's unscrupulous.
Taliesin: It would have been in a tale of a one-eyed merchant.
Matt: "Not any merchant I know, but this Den you speak of, they were a rather serious gang running rather violent activities in the city maybe 70, 80 years ago."
Taliesin: Would they have been in the walls? Is it possible to be in the walls of Ank'Harel?
Matt: "In the outer walls? The outer walls are solid. They are thick; they are meant for defense only. I did not run with them. I do not know anything. It was before my time, but they have not been around for at the very least 50 years."
Laura: All right.
Sam: Do you know who rules Ank'Harel now?
Matt: "It is J'mon Sa Ord."
Liam: What can you tell us about him? Or her, or it?
Matt: "J'mon? I have not seen J'mon, though I have heard the stories. J'mon brought the city together 400 years before. When it began to grow, expand, when it became this great oasis, long ago, it went into chaos, and there were many who wished to utilize those who lived within the center desert to be abused, to be swindled, to be enslaved. J'mon started the Hand of Ord, which was the peacekeepers, and really brought the town of Ank'Harel into the grand city it is today. Not known to appear in public very often; there are many rumors that circulate. Some say that perhaps J'mon is some godling, an entity that has existed long before Ank'Harel and will exist long after. There is also-- and this is my personal belief-- I think J'mon Sa Ord is many people. I think J'mon is more of an office, a station, a title that's passed on from person to person, because I've heard referenced as a girl, I've heard referenced as a boy."
Laura: It's like the Man in Black.
Liam: What story is that?
Laura: It's this famous tale of the Princess Bride. Don't worry about it.
Sam: Does the Hand of Ord carry any symbol? Do you know of any way of identifying them?
Matt: "They carry ornate armor of a deep blue sapphire color, and brass."
Liam: Brass.
Laura: Like the dragon.
Sam: And this other city, Shumble. Humbal.
Laura: Shandal.
Marisha: Shandal.
Matt: "Shandal! Yes. (laughs) It's more of a podunk."
Laura: A very small town.
Matt: "Comparatively, yes. Ank'Harel is immense. Shandal is usually a small stop in case camels or other horses have died in transit, as well as a small water stop on the way to the city."
Laura: Is it a long trek from there to the city?
Matt: "I'd say maybe a day's travel."
Sam: In which direction?
Matt: "It is to the south-southwest of Ank'Harel."
Liam: On par with Emon, the city? Bigger? Smaller?
Matt: "Oh, Emon? Comparable. A bit bigger."
Laura: Wow. Shit.
Taliesin: We'll make waves.
Marisha: Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't.
Taliesin: Well. We're going to have to get someone's attention.
Marisha: It's a city that has no water. We shouldn't make waves.
Laura: Do you remember, in all your time there, did you ever deal with-- this is completely ridiculous-- a merchant who only had one eye?
Matt: "I don't recall. I've met people missing many limbs and parts of their body. Kind of happens; it' a dangerous place, the deserts in Marquet. But there are also many people that live there."
Liam: And you're sure we can't talk you into going? Percy's giving out titles.
Taliesin: I am absolutely not!
Matt: "I have no interest in titles. I just wish to stay alive. I'm sorry. I am much more of use to you here, I assure you. I would be a perpetually nervous paranoid wreck if I were to come with you."
Laura: I can't even imagine you like that.
Matt: "Good. We'll keep it that way."
Marisha: Jarett, was there still a control of water going on while you were there?
Matt: "Yes, for many long years, yes. The oasis is built around."
Marisha: Is there anything we should know about that?
Matt: "Well, most of it's controlled in the River District. A number of canals begin in the River District. This is where there is the spring, the perpetual oasis that fuels the city, and many of the caravans that travel to and from."
Travis: Perpetual oasis.
Matt: "Yes."
Travis: Source of power. (laughter)
Sam: Good note-taking, Grog. How do people greet each other there in Ank'Harel? Is there a "Kord's strength be with you" thing?
Matt: "There is 'be pleased,' with a small bow, preferably with the hand down towards the stomach, with the hand out. Be pleased."
Laura: Be pleased.
Travis: Beep-bleep.
Liam: Bleep-bleep, yes. No stealing. Got it.
Sam: Water is valuable.
Laura: Don't drink the water.
Liam: Is there anything that's offensive? We don't want to offend anyone by accident.
Matt: "To be honest, anything you do will offend somebody in the right place, right time, but people are pretty laid back in Ank'Harel, as long as you follow the rules. It's a beautiful city. I'm actually excited for you to see it. I'm very proud of it, had I not made some mistakes."
Liam: Can we bring you anything back?
Matt: "You know what? If you can, there is a special spice that is harvested not far from the city. If you could find me some fusaka spice? Bring me a small-- not a lot, just a bit."
Travis: Is it for food?
Matt: "It's for food, yes."
Liam: I would love to do that. We'll keep an eye out.
Matt: "It's a bit pricey. I can give you some--"
All: No!
Liam: No, you've done way too much for us.
Taliesin: Fair trade.
Liam: Fair trade.
Matt: "All right. Well, I appreciate it."
Laura: Be pleased.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: We'll work on it.
Matt: "Work on it for a bit, maybe watch some folks. You'll pick it up right quick, just pay attention."
Sam: All right, well, shall we--
Taliesin: Let's go change, and then let's be off.
Matt: "All right, be safe, friends. Look forward to your return."
Laura: Keep everyone safe?
Matt: "That is my purpose."
Marisha: And Jarett, will you keep an eye on Gilmore for us?
Matt: "Is he all right?"
Marisha: I think he's just working himself a bit much.
Liam: Stretched a little thin.
Matt: "I may have noticed it myself. I will do this for you. Promise."
Marisha: Thank you.
Matt: "My pleasure."
Sam: To Marquet?
Travis: To market!
Sam: To buy a fine pig.
Marisha: To market!
Sam: Home again, home again.
Laura: I didn't realize Marquet was like Emon. This might be a bit difficult, to find a one-eyed merchant in a city bigger than Emon.
Taliesin: I think that once we arrive, he'll find us. Or she.
Laura: This is true.
Sam: We get there, we start poking people in the eye until someone doesn't flinch, then we'll know we found them.
Taliesin: Can I point out that now we have to learn an entirely new lore? We've worked so hard, and now spices? Rivers, canals, fusaka! Oh god, I'd gotten everything together, and now.
Laura: We've only got two weeks. Fuck.
Taliesin: It takes a day to do Disneyland.
Sam: Does anyone speak Marquetian, or do they speak Common there?
Taliesin: We'll run into a lot of Common. Common is common for a reason.
Sam: All right, let's go.
Matt: All right, you guys head back to Gilmore's place?
Laura: Oh, but are we going to get some water jugs and shit like that before we leave?
Sam: Sure, we get some water jugs.
Marisha: Yeah, more water's good.
Matt: You can pick up a few. We'll say for about five gold pieces here, you can acquire some jugs that are compact enough that they'll actually fit within the Bag of Holding, should you place them.
Liam: Five gold. Mark it off. (laughter)
Taliesin: Wow!
Sam: How we doing on potions? We got potions?
Laura: We need to get some potions.
Travis: There's no stores.
Matt: The healing potions that were available in the city you guys have already taken.
Marisha: Yeah, we've tapped them out there.
Taliesin: Yeah, Whitestone is not functioning.
Sam: All right, we'll get some in Marquet.
Taliesin: Trade them for water.
Travis: One for each?
Taliesin: You stabbed her bear while maintaining eye contact.
Laura: How many jugs did we get? Five jugs?
Matt: Five jugs.
Marisha: Slowly. Very slowly. Oh yeah.
Laura: And we fill up our wineskins with water.
Taliesin: We're changing out of the winters into the lighter clothing.
Marisha: I bust out some of my clothes from the Fire Ashari. Go lighter.
Taliesin: It's a shame Kit's very busy, or else we could get summer clothes.
Matt: She's so busy getting married or something.
Taliesin: Getting married or something.
Liam: I break into a cold sweat, thinking about the desert and this armor. Oh shit.
Laura: You're going to be a gross, sweaty, greasy mess.
Taliesin: Okay, actually there is a solution for this.
Liam: Yes, Percival. I have never needed your intellect more than right now. What is the solution?
Taliesin: I'm going to find him a white silk and cotton, linen cloak, very simple, to throw over his armor the way the Templars used to do, so you won't cook in your bloody armor.
Marisha: Does his little sachet--
Taliesin: Yes, it'll attach to the sachet.
Marisha: Well, I was going to say, does his sachet need a re-up of herbs? I thought you stuffed it with something.
Matt: Percival presents you with a nice, flowing, light whitish-gray cloak. Ceremonial, within older Whitestone gatherings. It seems nice; it seems light.
Liam: And I can put it over everything else?
Laura: Over your other cloaks.
Liam: Cloaks, plural. Fucking 90 episodes later cloaks, cloaks, cloaks.
Matt: You can totally place it over your Displacer Cloak.
Taliesin: Yeah. It's just a heat sink.
Liam: Yeah, it's to bounce the heat off.
Laura: Perfect.
Liam: Liam knows science. Vax doesn't know shit.
Matt: All right. What's the plan?
Sam: Before we go, quickly, guys. I'm sorry. I haven't done this yet, so can I try to see where Kaylie is and do a little scry?
Matt: You close your eyes and concentrate, and you see, peeking out from the metallic rim of the sword which you gave her, the Aberration's Bane longsword, you look up and you can see the edge of a wooden table. You hear faint music in the distance; it sounds like some sort of a piano being played. No accompaniment, just a straight piano. You hear distant whispers of conversation, the occasional burst of laughter, and you can see the edge of Kaylie's elbow, leaning against the edge of the table. There's a long pause, no movement. Then all of a sudden, she shifts back from the table and goes, "That's right, all the money on the table's mine. Nice try." Scoops down, throwing her hand of cards on the table. You hear a couple voices go (groaning). You see her scoop the coins over and go place them into a coin bag. "All right, so perhaps another round, then?"
Sam: Yeah! She's doing good!
Matt: "Where are you going? Are you a coward or something?" Shouting this in the distance, as apparently the previous people she card sharked walk off, frustrated and growling. You see one of them comes up to the edge of the table and goes, "Best be giving that money back, little girl or you're--" Before that happens, you see a large, meaty hand grab the back of his neck and pick up him by the scruff. You see appear into view the very edge of Dr. Dranzel's chin and hat and he goes, "I'm sorry, were you talking to my lady friend that way? That's poor manners." And drops him there at the table. The guy adjusts himself. "Better not see you guys in the street." He walks off. She reaches her hand up, watching the guy leave, and fist-bumps Dranzel. Your vision fades back and your consciousness comes back to you.
Sam: She's okay! Okay, good! All right! I feel good. Let's go!
Liam: What were you doing?
Sam: I had some bad tikka masala earlier.
Liam: We haven't even gone to Marquet!
Sam: They don't have Middle Eastern food there, I hope!
Taliesin: Well...
Liam: Not going to touch that one.
Travis: Are we going?
Liam: Let's go.
Taliesin: Let's go.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way back towards Gilmore's home. At this point in time, you come in and find there are a couple of plates, crumbs to the side. Gilmore's sitting in the chair with his tea, eyes closed in a meditative stance. As soon as you enter the room, he jolts back to momentary awareness. "All right! Gathered your things? Are you ready to go?"
Liam: Pretty much.
Matt: "If you don't mind." He grabs the edge of the central table in the center of the room with the tea on it. He looks towards you.
Travis: Oh yeah, no problem.
Matt: You guys shift it, move it to the side, leaving an open space on the ground. He kneels down and places one hand in the center of the floor. The other hand he reaches back into a small pouch on his side and pulls out a small amount of shimmering, glassy sand material you recognize as a hint of residuum processed into its dust crystallized form. He scatters it around while he's muttering under his breath. As he does, with his hand in the center, you see the dust pull together into these small symbols on their own, almost like magnets to iron filings. They're forming into these rigid structures. As they do, they begin to flare up and glow, and he takes a step back, his eyes still closed, brings his fist together into a grip. As he does, they light up, and you recognize this as a teleportation circle. He goes, "All right, it won't last long. In you go!"
Travis: Running through!
Laura: Thank you, Gilmore!
Matt: "My pleasure!" is the last thing you hear before you dive in as it begins to fade. Each of you guys step into and transition past, immediately piling up into each other as you come out the other side, as you're in a dark and enclosed cupboard or closet-type circumstance.
Taliesin: I'm reaching for a door handle.
Laura: Anywhere.
Matt: It looks like there is a set of doors to it. It's a giant armoire. You guys are pushed into it, but it is latched over.
Liam: Ugh, Grog's pec is right in my eye.
Laura: Can I get a little dagger through and flip the latch?
Matt: Flick it up. It bursts open, and you all come stumbling out.
Liam: I think he stabbed my eye out! Jeez!
Matt: As you all stop, Vex, you look back around. This is a very large dresser-like armoire. It's empty. It looks like there are a number of hangers inside, like it was a place for various outfits to be kept and stored. On the floor of the wood, you can see carved into it a small symbol or a sigil, if you will.
Sam: Drink!
Laura: Drink!
Matt: Marked as the symbol he put.
Laura: Good thing no one destroyed this thing while he was gone.
Matt: Glancing around, you can see a small dark wood room atop a wine-red circular carpet in the center. Empty shelves and cobwebs fill the corners. There's a bit of dust and sand coating over where the bed rests against the wall. A closed window hides behind a drawn curtain, with a little bit of peeking sunlight making its way through. There is one single door that sees you out, though it is currently closed.
Taliesin: I'm going to stand on the carpet and will it to fly. Seems worth a shot.
Laura: Every carpet here.
Matt: Step onto the carpet, close your eyes. How do you will it?
Taliesin: I do believe in fairies. I do believe in fairies. I know it; I've killed several of them. They're definitely real.
Matt: Moments pass, no effect.
Liam: I'm going to do my due diligence and make sure the door's okay. Probably is, but just in case.
Taliesin: I'm going to look out the window, as well.
Laura: I look under the bed.
Liam: 22. Just to make sure that it's not trapped or locked.
Matt: The door is locked. It is not trapped. You're peeking out the window, you said?
Taliesin: Yeah, I am.
Matt: You glance through the cloth, and it looks like it is a glass window, but it is partially opened and looks like there's a little cluster of sand that's gathered over time underneath the sill, from what little bit the wind's pushed through. Glancing out as soon as you push out, the light is very bright, and you have to take a moment for your eyes to adjust. Looking out, you see a simple street. There are some small buildings built of fine wood; nothing too extravagant. You can see a number of trees that protrude from the sand: long, tall, thin, palm frond-type tops to them, bearing some sort of large nut-like fruit. You can see what look to be small troughs of gathered water, whether it be from rain or them placed there intentionally, but they're currently locked with some semi-translucent top and chained shut, on the outside of two of the buildings. You do see a few people walking back up and down the street. General civilians, all dressed in longer, full-body robes, some of them with scarves around their neck. I wouldn't say peasants, per se, but definitely not well-off in their appearance. Casual civilians. Darker skin, looks like they've definitely been living in the desert for a long time. That is what you can see from the window's point of view.
Taliesin: Are we on the first floor or second floor?
Matt: Currently, you're on the first floor.
Sam: Is there a second floor?
Matt: You don't know.
Sam: Are there stairs? Oh, we're in a room. Let's go out the room. What could happen?
Matt: Looking under the bed, you see what appears to be a small wooden box that is closed and hidden toward the very back, and what appears to be a small series of shirts that have been folded up and have gathered a lot of dust over the top of them.
Laura: Can I reach them?
Matt: Yeah. Pull them out. Really nice, high-quality silk and cotton based, embroidered shirts. Look more ceremonial, special event type, long, maybe knee-length.
Marisha: What's the decoration like in the room?
Matt: Currently, it's pretty bland. You can see a couple of colored tapestries similar to the center of the floor rug that are hanging, but there are a lot of blank areas. It looks like decorations have been removed, or at least haven't been there for a long time. The room, for the most part, seems to be abandoned.
Laura: Is the box trapped?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Almost good, and then not. 14.
Matt: 14? It does not appear to be trapped.
Laura: Can I open it?
Matt: You do. Open it up, glance inside. It looks to be a series of folded papers.
Laura: Is it Gilmore's stuff?
Liam: Yeah, you're going through Shaun's shit. What are you doing?
Laura: I'm just seeing if this is his room!
Marisha: Ooh, whispers.
Travis: Oh shitballs. I have to move.
Marisha: How are those Cowboys doing, Travis?
Travis: Ten-ten, halftime.
Marisha: Oh snap.
Taliesin: Is that a good thing, ten-ten at halftime?
Travis: No, not good.
Taliesin: That's not good? Okay.
Travis: Their starting quarterback got hurt.
Taliesin: I understood all those words individually.
Travis: Because he's an old woman.
Taliesin: I know those words, as well.
Liam: Speaking in Half-Orc. Don't speak that.
Taliesin: I would pay good money to have you explain how football works to me.
Travis: That's what I was going with that!
Laura: Okay. I fold them back up and I put them under the bed.
Liam: Can I read your diary, then? Is that all right?
Laura: I was seeing if we were in Gilmore's room, that's all.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: All right.
Laura: Don't act like I'm a dick. I'm not stealing the letters. I'm putting the shirts back, all right?
Liam: I didn't say it! Just maybe he wants a little privacy. I don't know! Think about it.
Marisha: She's learned from you well.
Laura: Is the door open? Can we go out of here?
Sam: Did you find anything good?
Liam: If 25 opens the door, then it's opened.
Matt: It's easy enough, like butter. (creaking door) The door opens.
Marisha: He did say we would meet his family.
Matt: As the door opens up, immediately, your nose catches the smell of sage and cooked meats. As the door opens, you look into a large room to your left with some furniture, not too extravagant, but nice, and a humble living space. As the door opens the other way, you look to the right, and you see two figures sitting at a table, seemingly eating. An older couple, with dark sun-weathered skin, graying hair, and bright eyes. They look confused and slightly scared at their table, staring back at people wandering into the middle of the room.
Travis: It's okay.
Marisha: Hi!
Taliesin: This is a bit awkward.
Sam: We're friends of Gilmore.
Laura: Shaun.
Matt: They both look at each other.
Sam: Oh, be pleased.
Travis: Bees knees.
Matt: They both look to each other and then immediately begin, mouths filled with food, laughing. (laughs) "This is unexpected. Friends of Shaun's, you say?"
All: Yes.
Matt: The man himself stands up and begins to walk over, wiping the edge of his mouth with a small piece of cloth, finishing chewing and swallowing the food he has currently. As he walks up, the man has thinning white hair that grows long, straight down towards his back, simple long robe-like dress with simple cloth pants that go round these slipper-like shoes on his feet. He approaches. Which one said Shaun?
Sam: You said Gilmore.
Matt: Gilmore and Shaun. Approaches you, as you, stepping forward as one of the more, you know, assertive members of the party, and goes, "How is he? If you could please tell me?"
Laura: He's quite well. He's very powerful, actually, and has wonderful businesses, all through--
Marisha: Tal'Dorei?
Laura: No, I know. It's just not there anymore.
Matt: "Opesa. Opesa, come." And the woman gets up from the table. "Yes, I'm sorry. It has been a while since we've had guests from so strange and sudden arrivals!" She walks up and pulls these small glasses out from her pocket and puts them on. You can see her eyes open up wide behind them, and she comes, leans to the side and puts her arm around him. They both hold each other. He goes, "I am sorry. Let me introduce. I am Soren Geddmore. This is Opesa Geddmore. You know our son?"
Liam: Yes, for quite some time.
Matt: "And you say he does well with his business?"
Laura: He does. So well, yes.
Taliesin: Continental.
Matt: "This is good."
Laura: Very respected.
Liam: Yes, and brave.
Matt: "He has always been a brave one."
Sam: Single-handedly protecting a whole city right now.
Matt: "You don't have to embellish. That's okay. Would you like to eat with us? We can make more food, yes?"
Laura: Actually, we need to head out pretty quickly.
Taliesin: We're sadly on a mission.
Laura: Can you tell us the direction to Ank'Harel?
Matt: "You are going to Ank'Harel?"
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Yes. Follow me." He takes her by the arm, and they both walk arm-in-arm, leading you guys to what looks to be a front door of this abode. As he pushes it open, revealing more of the street of this small oasis town, he goes, "Let's see, if you follow-- that is the sun." He looks up, and you see his eyes adjust to the brighter sky. "The sun is there. It will be setting... that direction. Continue... what is the word you speak?"
Sam: North, northwest. No, northeast.
Matt: "That is west. You want to north, so go that way. Yes. That is where you want to go."
Laura: Thank you.
Sam: Is there a road to follow, or is it just a direction?
Matt: "I haven't been in many years. As far as I know, there are signs. There are not roads. There are guides you could hire to bring you there."
Marisha: Can I do like a nature check or take note of what he said so I remember? Because that was vague.
Laura: I'm assuming these are the people that Gilmore said I would know.
Matt: You get the sense these are probably who he was referring to.
Laura: Yes, so as she's doing that, I want to pull out the locket and say, actually, Shaun asked me to deliver this to you.
Matt: "What--" And he looks to his wife. The woman steps forward adjusting her glasses. "Thank you so much!" She holds it and opens it up. Looks over to him and shows him. You get a bit of a glance, at that point. You can see it's a picture of Gilmore. He's happy. Jewel-encrusted rings. It's almost a promotional still, if there was one, for Gilmore's Glorious Goods. She takes it. She closes it and goes, "Gilmore is originally Geddmore. He changed his name when he went for better business to the Tal'Dorei place. Glad he's doing well."
Taliesin: He's respected across the continent.
Liam: Is there anything we can let him know?
Matt: "Give him our love and tell him he is more than welcome to visit. It has been many years."
Liam: We will.
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: "Not a worry. Safe travels. You're sure you don't wish to have food?"
Liam: No, but if you could point us towards fusaka? Is there any around here? There's not, is there?
Matt: They both look at each other. "I'm not familiar with this spice you speak of. My apologies." She's like, "I'm sorry. I do not know this fusaka you speak of."
Liam: He's pulling our chain.
Sam: Or maybe it's something illicit.
Laura: It's possible.
Taliesin: It's possible.
Sam: Or something that you snort.
Liam: He's pretty cool.
Laura: I understand.
Taliesin: Can we leave them a bit of water?
Sam: Yeah, we should leave them some water.
Laura: Oh yes.
Sam: Grog! Water boy?
Travis: Yes?
Laura: Can you give them some water from our jug?
Taliesin: Where do you keep your personal water?
Laura: Would you like some water?
Travis: I got it. Here, take this jug of water with our compliments. You said give them a jug!
Taliesin: Where do you store your water in the house?
Matt: "We have, around this way--" He leads you towards the back of this small kitchen. It's very condensed. You can see there is a high metal fence, and there appears to be a rainwater receptacle there, like a well that is built into the homestead. It has chains over the top. He begins to pull keys out and lock to it, and as he pulls off the chains one by one, he pulls back the lid, this hard, dry wooden lid, and within it is a very deep well, though it looks like the water level's maybe ten feet down from the top of the well right now.
Travis: You want me to pour the Alchemy Jug in here? Or just one of the little ones?
Taliesin: Pour the Alchemy. The little one's for us today. The Alchemy Jug, this is where it's going.
Travis: All right, I take the Alchemy Jug and I go: You want to see a trick? Look inside. Do you see anything?
Matt: "Hey, Opesa, do you see anything?" And she blinks a bit. "No, it's empty."
Travis: And I say  Now, give it a listen. And I shake it. What do you hear?
Matt: "Nothing. You are a strange man." (laughter)
Travis: Forgot they're old. Right, well, it sounds-- fuck it. Water. And I start pouring. (laughter)
Matt: How much water does it create?
Travis: It creates eight gallons of fresh water.
Matt: Oh wow. "You are still a very strange man, but I'm very happy and appreciative."
Travis: I am a great sorcerer.
Matt: "All right. I can see, now. Gilmore has his work cut out for him."
Travis: Gedd-e-mo-ray.
Matt: He pats your shoulder. "Geddmore, indeed." As you finish pouring the water out, they lead you guys back to the front.
Laura: What time is it here?
Matt: He pulls out a small sundial from his pocket, holds it up. "It would be closer to late afternoon."
Laura: No, we aren't going to make it to Ank'Harel by dark. Yes, of course. That's all. Thank you!
Matt: "Well, thank you so much for coming."
Taliesin: Good day.
Travis: Beep-beep!
Sam: Be pleased.
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Liam: Be pleased.
Matt: "Be pleased." And they both, in a very rusty joints way, give you both a bow as you leave.
Liam: They were a couple of sweethearts.
Sam: They are adorable! They're both over 70, so who's going to kill them? Should Grog, or should I?
Taliesin: I think it's our turn.
Laura: You broke him!
Sam: You kill one, I'll kill the other.
Liam: Throwback Thursday.
Taliesin: This is what a d10 is for. Hold on, one second.
Marisha: Do we have any more reason to be here? Or should we start heading off to Ank'Harel?
Taliesin: I think we head off to Ank'Harel.
Laura: Yeah, unless we see any kind of potion shops here.
Marisha: I can mist us. I brought it today.
Taliesin: Oh. We can mist.
Liam: Is there enough moisture in the air? I have no idea how it works.
Travis: Shit, if we evaporate, I'll be so pissed.
Marisha: Wait. Can that happen?
Travis: You don't know!
Taliesin: I think it'll be fine.
Marisha: Because we're mist.
Taliesin: We're mostly water. I think it's our water. I think we end up very dehydrated at the end of it.
Marisha: Sorry, I just spit all over you. I'm sorry.
Taliesin: It's okay. Now I'm moister.
Marisha: That's how mist form works.
Travis: Now I'm moisture.
Marisha: I don't think we'd evaporate. I think he's fucking with us. I don't think we'd evaporate.
Laura: Let's mist it.
Matt: That would be the saddest TPK ever. "Let's go, guys!" And so ends the journey of Vox Machina. (laughter)
Marisha: They fade into existence!
Laura: That would be the worst thing ever.
Taliesin: Was that a global warming metaphor?
Travis: No songs to be sung. Just fucking another cloud in the fucking sky.
Sam: Some say you can see them still, overhead. (laughter)
Marisha: I don't think we'll evaporate.
Laura: Let's do it.
Sam: We're going to mist it?
Marisha: Do we need anything else while we're here, before I do this?
Taliesin: It's a one-camel town.
Marisha: I mist us.
Matt: All right. As you guys take a moment to concentrate, each one of you transforms into mist. As you begin to go one by the other, you do hear a couple of (gasps). You glance over your shoulder to see three kids, all looking up at you all with these big, scared smiles.
Marisha: Before I go, I say  stay in school, kids. And then I mist.
Taliesin: I'm going to Slimer the kid.
Laura: As I turn into mist, I go  I'm melting! Melting! Oh, what a world!
Matt: Make a deception check.
Marisha: I was trying to inspire them!
Taliesin: You're a terrible person!
Laura: 20.
Liam: Do they speak Common?
Matt: After you give your presentation, they, "Whoa!" As you begin transforming, you do that and they go, (terrified screaming) and go running indoors.
Taliesin: I'm still going to slime them on their way out.
Marisha: Sliming them!
Sam: We're tormenting children.
Liam: Hey, that's a step up for us!
Matt: That's what Vox Machina is all about.
Taliesin: Scarring children for life.
Travis: If you can't kill the old, terrify the young.
Taliesin: We're leaving them with a promise that we'll be back to finish the job.
Matt: You are terrible people. You guys rise into the air as the sun begins to bring itself to set in the west. You shift up over the city. You look down. Probably maybe 150, 200 buildings make up the entirety of Shandal. It's not a very large town, but you can see little dots of moving caravans both to and from the city. It is a fairly lively stop for people traveling to and from Ank'Harel.
Taliesin: We can follow traffic.
Marisha: Follow traffic.
Taliesin: There's a traffic line, then.
Matt: Every now and then. As you follow the direction they're going, you're traveling much faster than they are. The hot air does feel a little uncomfortable against your cloud-based misty forms, but you do not feel like it's responsible for evaporating any of your form.
Marisha: Yeah, we're just sweating a little bit more.
Matt: You're like, "oh this is uncomfortable." You continue to press forward as the sun slowly begins to set. The temperature begins to get colder and colder, and the sky grows darker.
Marisha: Do we condense a little bit? Turn into a low-lying fog? Never mind.
Matt: If you'd like to. It's up to you entirely. The form is your choice.
Travis: Could we turn into a marine layer?
Matt: You continue to travel throughout the night?
Sam: How long does this thing last?
Laura: Eight hours, right? It lasts eight hours?
Sam: We'll travel eight hours.
Taliesin: We'll take a late night. Once it wears off, then we'll camp.
Laura: Can we get the whole way there?
Marisha: Wind Walk, you said it was a day's journey, and we can travel faster by Wind Walking.
Sam: At night, will we know where northeast is?
Laura: Yeah, I've got an excellent sense of direction.
Taliesin: If it's only a day's travel, at some point we're going to see the city.
Marisha: I think we should be able to get there, right?
Laura: And we can camp just outside the city, maybe?
Sam: Okay. Let's do it.
Marisha: Because we have a flying speed of 300 feet.
Matt: Yes, you guys cruise. You guys push forward for another four to five hours post-dusk. You're now hitting the early hours of the morning before you begin to see in the distance hundreds of sparking lights begin to appear up above a distant sand dune. You can see the lit lights, lanterns, and general glowing night life of a massive city over the high walls that surround its exterior. This is a pretty amazing sight for those of you who have not been to such a large desert atmosphere, and it is pitch black below you, and at the height you're traveling-- How high are you traveling versus the ground? I guess I should ask.
Taliesin: 300 feet?
Marisha: An appropriate cloud height.
Sam: That's thousands.
Marisha: Hundreds. A couple hundred feet.
Matt: Okay. From this view, you can see a large queue about eight heavy caravan carts long of caravans that have camped for the night outside of the front main gates. You do see, along the line of the outer wall, there appear to be a number of small spires that open up like guard tower parapets that come to a pointed, what looks like a hand, cradling the outside of each section of the wall on the outside, but on the inside, you see a hundred or more of these long, multi-level spires that progress all throughout the city, and it goes on and on in its large oval-like shape. It's hard to make out much color other than the thousand small lights you see throughout the entire city. Orange, yellows, greens, blues. It is a beautiful view. What is your plan?
Taliesin: I say we camp outside.
Liam: Are we still clouds, though?
Taliesin: We're still clouds.
Liam: Can't talk at all.
Laura: Should we mist down?
Sam: Are we getting to the end of our eight hours anyway?
Marisha: It's been five or six.
Laura: It's still night?
Matt: Still night, yes.
Laura: It's good to camp.
Matt: It's two in the morning, at this point.
Marisha: Does there look like any patch of shrubs or a low point in the terrain? Cover.
Matt: You can't tell from this height, unfortunately.
Laura: We mist down a little bit.
Matt: You scoot down around the outside of the city walls. The landscape here near the town appears to be more packed and hardened badland dust and sand. You can see where lots of it, from a recent rain, have caked and hardened and then broken in places. It leaves this soft, shale-type texture to it that breaks into sand upon crumbling underfoot. From what you can see, there are a number of various heights of dunes in the distance. This city is thrown right in the center of what appears to be hundreds of miles of desert from the view that you had as the sun was setting.
Laura: And the gates to the city are closed at night?
Matt: The gates to the city are closed from this perspective, yes.
Liam: We did it, you guys. We made it to Burning Man.
Matt: You guys timed this, I didn't.
Laura: Can we see guards around? Do they look aggressive?
Matt: The giant iron gates stand about 65 feet tall and about as wide from end to end. They have a very tight weave of iron bars between them, to where it's almost a very thick fencing that you can almost see through. You can just see the outline of things that walk back and forth behind it. However, on the front side, you can see a number of guards.
Laura: We can see your piece of paper on the screen. Still see it.
Matt: Stop looking at my piece of paper on the screen!
Liam: There's a Vestige!
Matt: Not actually. Not anymore, it's not! It's gone! All right. Amongst the carved-out circle of caravan carts and people that are camping overnight before entering the city, you do see what appear to be a dozen guards, all dressed in dark blue and dark reddish metallic armor, many carrying heavy scimitars to their side or long pikes and shields. They're all wearing intricate helmets that crest down past the nose to the point where it looks like they just have eyes and a lower jaw. It flares out at the bottom and then curves to a point right across where the clavicle would be. The armor itself is designed in a very beautiful ornate fashion, but also looks very functional. You're at a distance; they don't seem to have noticed you as you've all crested down still in your cloud forms.
Laura: We should probably land far away.
Taliesin: I'm going to de-mist. There seems to be a section where people are camping. Let's just, for once, take this by the book. We want to make sure they know we're here. No sneaking into the city.
Marisha: I don't think they'd take kindly to surprises.
Taliesin: At worst, we've got the pretense of being emissaries from Emon looking for help.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: They punish people for nicking things. I don't think we want to try to break in.
Taliesin: No. we're going to try and be truthful as much as possible, although nobody say the W word.
Travis: Wine?
Laura: Wine, definitely wine.
Marisha: I'm assuming that that's the Hand of Ord that we're looking at.
Sam: The Hand of Ord is supposed to be super secret.
Taliesin: It might just be guards.
Matt: The Hand of Ord isn't secret.
Marisha: No, he said the Hand of Ord is the name of the peacekeeping guards.
Taliesin: Yes, that's right.
Laura: All right!
Taliesin: Let's camp for the evening.
Laura: Shall we camp in the mansion, then?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: So comfortable.
Sam: Sure.
Liam: We're still a distance though? Where we are, from the guards?
Laura: Yeah. We're off a little bit.
Matt: How far are you guys? How far did you decide to stop and transform? That's up to you.
Liam: I don't know.
Taliesin: Where were the other people camping for the night?
Matt: They're maybe 40 feet from the gates.
Taliesin: Well, let's camp 40 feet. Let's camp with them.
Travis: You want to put a magical door 40 feet?
Taliesin: I'm perfectly okay. It's not like they can come in. No one can enter who can't be invited.
Liam: You want to make a mystical door floating in the middle of their tents?
Laura: Do the people seem friendly? Do they seem tired?
Taliesin: We're going to camp next to their campsite.
Matt: Make a perception check
Liam: In this world, on the ground? I love it. We haven't done it that much lately.
Taliesin: We've been too used to being careful.
Marisha: In the mansion.
Laura: 22.
Marisha: So not really camping. We're glamping.
Matt: At a safe distance, you can make out some detail, and there is some lantern light on top of some of these carts. It appears that a number of the folks have set up small tents, and most appear to be sleeping. There are a few guards that are set on top of the carts with crossbows resting over their lap, keeping an eye in case anyone decides to get too close to their wares throughout the evening.
Laura: How about we keep a distance?
Marisha: Yeah, let's not mist down in the middle of a group.
Laura: No, let's keep a distance from them and be another group of people coming into the city.
Travis: I'd say 200 yards out.
Liam: Percival said he already un-misted.
Marisha: We're deciding how far. So 200 yards.
Taliesin: I can re-mist.
Liam: We can all do that?
Taliesin: As long as the eight hours hasn't passed, we can go in and out as you please, isn't that correct?
Matt: Yeah. It takes you a minute to transform.
Sam: Should we use our misting while we have it and mist into the city?
Travis: That's what I said, but they punish crime so harshly.
Sam: We haven't committed any crime.
Laura: No, but they have to document who goes in and out.
Sam: They won't even know--
Liam: Scan-man, let's start by playing nice, please.
Marisha: And if we get caught, they're going to know we didn't sign in correctly.
Taliesin: They have giant spires, yeah, and they're going to say "who are you?" and we're not going to be on the list.
Liam: We know nothing about these people or the customs here.
Travis: Yeah, we've got to learn a little bit before we kill all of them.
Marisha: I don't see any trees, and those guards look heavily funded. That looks like expensive armor they're all wearing.
Taliesin: You've got a good eye, yes.
Laura: Can we have the mansion, Scanlan?
Sam: Sure, yes, we can do the mansion.
Taliesin: Get close enough to the other group that they are aware that we exist, but they couldn't quite make us out, so just another group of travelers camping for the night.
Liam: With a door floating in the air.
Taliesin: It's magic. It's not like they've never seen it before.
Matt: The light radius beyond the wall itself is not very strong. It only low-lights maybe a 30- to 40-foot area around the gate itself, and there are a series of small torches that appear to be ever-burning on the outside of the wall. There are a few campfires that have been set up by the caravans that are waiting amongst the sand and broken ground there. They give a little more light. As you guys get to the outskirts of this, your shapes becoming visible to those that are keeping watch, you see a few individuals stand up on their carts with their crossbows at the ready. Just have a seat and keep an eye bead on those of you that are visible. Doesn't appear to be any aggressive action, just an acknowledgement of your presence and a show of readiness should any aggressive action be taken.
Liam: I'm going to not say anything but do the "be pleased" motion.
Laura: He already did that.
Liam: Well, I'm doing it, as well.
Laura: I'm going to watch you do it.
Sam: So we've un-misted. Are we going to mansion and go to sleep?
Taliesin: We're going to mansion. It's 2 00am. It's time to mansion and go to sleep.
Sam: All right. We'll do that.
Marisha: Okay, the people who are camping, what do they look like? Pretty common folk, I'm assuming?
Matt: Best you tell at this distance, the few that you can see-- because a lot of them appear to be in small tents encamped-- the few that you do make out appear to be dressed in a little more wealthy attire than the people you encountered in Shandal. You can see the gentlemen and ladies that are guarding the encampment are dressed in functional leathers with hints of hide and metal plates incorporated in the defense, but nothing that shows overt wealth or overt destitution. General mercenary guardians for a traveling caravan.
Marisha: Okay. Are we going to talk to any of them?
Taliesin: Unless there's a brazenly loud group around one of the campfires.
Matt: At this hour? No. You get the sense, looking at the surroundings of the campfires, it looks like some sort of party or gathering may have transpired earlier in the evening, but most everyone have passed out at this time.
Laura: The guards are guarding. Anybody that approaches is a threat.
Sam: Yeah, we'll just go to sleep.
Taliesin: Goodnight, all. I am ready for bed.
Matt: Scanlan?
Sam: I will make the mansion.
Matt: The doorway glows with a faint purple hue. In the distance, you see some of the guards step forward and keep an eye out there. Attention has been gained by the doorway, but none of them are approaching immediately. You guys begin to step into the doorway one by one as three of the guards begin to slowly walk towards the doorway.
Taliesin: I'll go last. It'll be fine.
Marisha: I go in.
Liam: Scanlan, why don't you hang with Percival? I go in.
Travis: Yeah, in.
Laura: I stand in the doorway.
Sam: We going to talk to these people?
Taliesin: We're going to let them know who we are and what we're doing. This is just that we have a very expensive tent.
Sam: Great.
Matt: So with that, Percival, Scanlan, and Vex wait outside the shimmering doorway to Scanlan's magnificent mansion. You see the guards begin to approach. The one at the front, a square-jawed, intense-looking man who looks to be not enjoying his current time schedule as a guard on the outside of the southern gates of Ank'Harel approaches, hand at the side clutching some sort of weapon that he has currently sheathed. "May I ask the business of this strange conjuration you've brought at this hour of the night?"
Taliesin: It is our very expensive tent.
Sam: Be pleased.
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Laura: Be pleased.
Matt: Make a persuasion check, Percy.
Taliesin: That'll do. 23. Yeah, 24 actually. 24!
Matt: "I do not know of the nature of this magic that you bring, but I recommend that you keep it outside of the city."
Taliesin: Oh, yes, of course.
Laura: Wait, is magic not allowed within the city?
Matt: "Oh, magic is allowed, but this is unknown to us, and unknown magic is a dangerous magic."
Taliesin: I thank you for your advice. We will heed it well. What is your name, sir?
Matt: "It does not matter. We have 12 crossbows trained on this doorway, and will for the remainder of the evening. Should anything strange happen, we will not hesitate but to fire."
Taliesin: The strangest thing you will see this evening will be us.
Matt: "Good."
Laura: Thank you for the warning.
Matt: Turns around and walks back to the gate.
Taliesin: That could not have gone better.
Travis: (singing) We've got to kill everybody. (laughter)
Laura: Magic is allowed, but this is strange magic. How will we know what isn't strange magic?
Taliesin: Everything we can do is strange magic. Be prepared that not being from around here is going to be trouble.
Marisha: Yeah, I think we're just strange.
Laura: I hold the door open.
Liam: We've had old magic, new magic, strange magic.
Matt: This is all the new schools of magic.
Sam: We go in.
Matt: You guys go in. Mansion's prepared, servants are at your ready, beds are freshly fluffed. Damaged kitchens are rearranged to have been not touched at all.
Travis: What?!
Laura: Wonderful.
Sam: I love it.
Matt: You are able to rest for the evening as you prepare for your next day entering the city of Ank'Harel itself.
Taliesin: I make my way, quietly in the night, to Grog's room. I was just kidding, sorry!
Travis: (laughing) I was like, "come get some, bitch!"
Laura: No, I want to go to sleep, and I'm holding on to Fenthras and thinking about everything.
Matt: Mulling over the events that recently transpired and digesting all the questions you still have.
Taliesin: I gave you a lot to think about, didn't I? Sorry. (laughs)
Sam: I play a card game by myself.
Matt: Okay. As you guys have a restful night, we're going to take a break. We'll be back here in a few minutes, and we'll pick this up in the following morning as they enter the city itself. See you in a minute! [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone! Returning from the break, Vox Machina has an evening of rest in Scanlan's magnificent mansion. You come to consciousness the following morning, stationed within the beautiful confines of this magical mansion, unaware directly of what awaits you on the other side of the doorway. However, the morning is yours. What do you wish to do?
Liam: I'm going to stealth back to my room.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: No one sees anything.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: No worries. I got a one, but I'll use luck.
Marisha: You're using a luck?
Liam: Two ones!
Taliesin: Two ones!
All: (yelling) Yes!
Taliesin: There is a god, and he hates you!
Marisha: You are so walk of shaming right now. (laughter)
Matt: So as the morning comes about, Vex, you go stretch out of your room, scratching the side of your head, messed up from sleeping wrong on the pillow, and as you walk out you hear (clicking) and look to your right and see your brother slowly slinking away from Keyleth's room.
Laura: (retching) I go back in my room.
Liam: Oh hey, hold on a second, though.
Travis: Oh man. (laughs) Talk it out.
Marisha: Talk it out right now.
Laura: I'm about to throw up.
Liam: No, you make jokes, but I want to go into your room for a second and talk to you.
Travis: Ew! Make him bathe.
Laura: Fine. And I go in my room and I sit down on the opposite side of the room.
Liam: Take a full minute to get over it, you fucker.
Laura: Hold on, it's not been a minute. All right.
Liam: You really should have gone into acting. It really was your calling. Yeah.
Laura: No, I'm happy for you. As foul as it is. What are you doing? What?
Liam: (sighs) Sorry, I'm a little discombobulated. I've never rolled two ones in a row.
Matt: Yeah, that happened.
Laura: Oh, that was so amazing.
Matt: Take that, Luck feat! (laughter)
Liam: I know this is a really stupid time to talk about it, but we never get to talk to each other, and I have a serious question. (nervous laugh) Relax. In that tree, that guy said a lot of fucked-up shit to you, and it just sounded like a lot of fucked-up shit and him trying to make you feel bad, so fuck him, right? Fuck that guy. But he said something about a dagger? And I saw your face fall.
Laura: (soft laugh) Jesus Christ.
Liam: And I asked you if you were all right the other day, and I think you might have not told me the entire truth. Are you all right?
Laura: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Right now?
Liam: I could be dead tomorrow, Vex. Right now.
Laura: He knew a lot of things, yes. I don't think he was completely wrong, and that's what makes me feel terrible.
Liam: About what, about you being shitty? Fuck that guy!
Laura: Well, he was right about the dagger.
Liam: I want you to tell me about the dagger. I want to know about the dagger, but I'm serious, fuck that guy on the rotten branches he was growing out of. He's not right. Your strength of character runs deep. Fuck that guy! It breaks my heart to see you doubt yourself. You have always been a wonderful woman! I'm not saying you have to be a fucking beefcake; you don't have to be a soldier, but--
Laura: That's good, because I am really weak. (laughs)
Liam: Whatever the case, you are a good person. All of them know that. They all know that. None of them doubt it. I don't doubt it. I don't have the words, I just want you to believe me.
Laura: Thank you.
Liam: I'm not eloquent like Percival, but I've known you a long time. You are a good person.
Laura: Thank you. It makes me happy to see you happy.
Liam: Forgot what it feels like.
Laura: Yeah, right?
Liam: What's the dagger?
Laura: Oh, that. Yeah, I killed a couple people and I saved Trinket, that's all.
Liam: When?
Matt: Trinket comes waking up from what was his sleeping stance.
Liam: You'll have to be more specific than that.
Laura: Do you remember when I brought Trinket back to camp?
Liam: Originally?
Laura: Yeah! All those years ago?
Liam: Yes! I thought it was a terrible idea. I was dead wrong.
Laura: (laughs) Well... turns out, I found him in a camp where I'd been taken.
Liam: What?
Laura: Yes, and there was some really dark people there, and they had harvested--
Sam: (sneezes)
Laura: Trinket's mother. Bless you. Is Scanlan in the room?
Liam: The paintings do all have holes cut in the eyes, so you can never be sure.
Laura: I did what I had to do, and I killed them.
Liam: The people that took you.
Laura: Yes. I did.
Liam: The people that took you from me?
Laura: Yes. And I saved Trinket that night, and that's what Saundor saw. More than anything I just... I don't know how he saw it.
Liam: Are you just creeped out because he knew or because of what happened? Why are you upset?
Laura: I'm not.
Liam: Well, listen. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened, but... you came back to me, so whatever happened can't be wrong.
Laura: Right? (sniffles)
Liam: Oh, come here! Come here! If somebody took you from me... I don't know how to see it any other way than I do. You would have to do something really terrible, Vex'ahlia, for me to ever feel disappointment in you, and you have not ringed that bell. Rung it?
Laura: Rung it.
Liam: You studied harder than I did.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Goodness, please. One more time  You are a good person, and I've always seen that. Please see it, please. Oh god, my heart is breaking.
Laura: No! It's good. We all need to self-reflect every once in a while. I needed it. My heart is in the right place. I know it is. I'm just afraid sometimes actions speak louder than intentions. If things I was doing could be read the wrong way, then... maybe I need to change what I do.
Liam: (sighs) You've always been bold. That's not a crime. That's all right.
Laura: It's fine, dear.
Liam: I feel like a boy again.
Laura: (laughs) No, please. I'm so happy to see you happy. Don't worry about me. I'm fine!
Liam: Well, no, but--
Laura: And I can talk to Trinket now. We talk all the time.
Liam: Vex'ahlia.
Laura: We've talked through a lot.
Liam: Vex.
Laura: Right?
Liam: Vex.
Laura: Yes? (laughs)
Liam: Fuck, I'm just going around-- I love you.
Laura: I love you.
Liam: You don't have to talk to me about everything, but if you want to... if you want to. Should you need me.
Laura: "Should you need me."
Liam: All right. Sorry to babble.
Laura: Oh, yeah, no. Maybe go take a shower.
Liam: I'm not going to answer that. I'll see you at breakfast. And I walk away.
Matt: Yeah, you do. All right, as you all find breakfast, a fair prepared chicken feast, as they've been given no other instruction. (laughter)
Travis: Can't we change it up?
Liam: I'm afraid not.
Sam: Change up the food?
Laura: Yeah, maybe something other than chicken.
Sam: Why? It's nutritious. It's delicious.
Travis: Ravioli!
Sam: Ravioli for breakfast? All right.
Laura: Something with veggies?
Sam: Let's do ravioli. Staff?
Matt: "Yes, Scanlan?"
Laura: Oh, they speak?
Travis: Shit, they do talk!
Sam: Could you make us some chicken ravioli?
Liam: You unlocked "Ravioli in Marquet!"
Laura: They're learning.
Travis: They're smart. We have to kill them all!
Taliesin: They're going to learn.
Matt: The servants vanish for about ten minutes and return with a robust meal of bowls and bowls of chicken ravioli.
Travis: Chicken ravioli. (laughs)
Laura: Delicious.
Sam: Yummy.
Travis: Good call.
Taliesin: Adequate.
Matt: Slightly. You finish your meal, feel yourself satiated as much as you can be with chicken ravioli for breakfast. You guys exit, find yourself on the exterior walls of Ank'Harel, the sun blazing down in the early morning, a hotter temperature than you've been used to in quite some time. Would be the equivalent of probably the low 100s Fahrenheit by our standards. All of you with layers of armor, which is all of you except for Grog, immediately feel this is going to be uncomfortable fairly quickly. Grog, you are used to higher colder climates, even without being heavily armored, still fairly uncomfortable.
Travis: Sucks.
Liam: You're really pale, too.
Matt: It's not great. You can see the caravans that you guys were camping loosely next to are no longer there. It looks like there have been a couple of dark spots in the dust and the sand that have been kicked over where the campsites were, where the fires were put out, and tracks of where the carts and wheels have been dragged to and through the gate. You can now see about ten guards that are all stationed at the front of that iron gate on this side of the Ank'Harel wall.
Sam: Well? Should we go in and be traveling people and kill everyone that we see?
Travis: How about you let me take the lead on this?
Laura: How about no?
Sam: What's our angle? We are weary travelers from Tal'Dorei, seeking--
Marisha: I thought we were going into this one with honesty. Thought we agreed to that.
Sam: Seeking help?
Marisha: We're ambassadors from Emon.
Travis: Keyleth, do you really want to be honest or is it a ploy? Do we want to be honest?
Taliesin: The ploy is to be honest.
Marisha: Our normality is dishonesty, so technically we're switching it up.
Laura: This is the ploy.
Taliesin: This is a radical shift.
Marisha: We're not honest, so let's try it for once.
Sam: All right, let's do it. We're from Emon, we need help fighting dragons.
Marisha: I feel like that's pretty compelling.
Matt: Grog, make an intelligence check.
Travis: (laughs) Yeah, thank you. Travis needs to make an intelligence check. Oh Jesus, it's a 12. Minus two.
Matt: You have no idea what they're talking about. You find yourself instinctually nodding.
Sam: We'll just go in, big guy. We'll be fine.
Liam: First chance for violence is all yours. You're the first one in.
Travis: I'm all in. Violence. That's what I came away with.
Marisha: (sighs) We have to be careful with our word choices with him.
Taliesin: We head towards the gate.
Travis: (garbled) This ravioli is delicious, by the way. My compliments to the little purple men.
Sam: They're not men, but yes.
Matt: As you guys approach the outside of the gate, you can see seven of the guards stay behind while three, seemingly the same three that had been keeping a close eye upon your initial approach in the evening, walk up. The same man walks up, now looking a little tired; his day is probably finishing out the rest of his station here at the gate. Approaches, hand still on the side of his sheathed weapon. "So you awaken. You have rested. What is your business here in Ank'Harel?"
Sam: We are weary travelers from Emon, and we have come to seek assistance with the security of our home.
Matt: "What is your contact within the city? Who do you wish to speak to?"
Liam: Go for the top?
Marisha: Oh, that's a really far stretch. The king.
Sam: We are seeking a man called...
Liam: J'mon Sa Ord.
Sam: No, I don't think we want to talk to the king. Do we?
Marisha: Merchant warrior? No, not that one? Who the fuck are we trying to see?
Sam: We would like to talk to J'mon Sa Ord or his or her advisors to seek advice.
Matt: "You come for an audience with the emperor?"
Taliesin: We come for an audience with many people, to be honest. We are looking at many avenues of possible help. Contacts, trade, anything that can help us in our time of dire need.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Sam: Me or him?
Matt: You.
Sam: Oh. Okay. It was a million.
Taliesin: I didn't know that that die went that high.
Sam: 34.
Laura: It's a million.
Matt: His arm relaxes at the side of his weapon, and he looks down upon your diminutive gnomish structure, though glances over at the much larger goliath and back at you. "If you indeed have business with J'mon Sa Ord, then the emperor will let you in. If you do not, you will be sent out. We have no business between either of those answers. If you wish to enter, do so, but keep your weapons sheathed, and keep an eye on that one."
Sam: The big one?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: He's well-behaved.
Matt: "I don't trust his face."
Taliesin: His face is usually not the trouble.
Liam: Is it the beard?
Matt: "Very well. Welcome to Ank'Harel. Be pleased."
All: Be pleased.
Matt: He turns around and walks away. His bow is much smaller than you were originally taught by Jarett. You get the sense that that's more of a formality and is on a smaller scale for more informal conversations. As he walks back, he lifts one hand and does a loop with it. As he does, (door thudding). The gates open ever so slightly, enough to bring through as broad-shouldered an individual as Grog, as well as the rest of you easily. You guys walk up and approach.
Laura: Is anybody looking at Trinket weird, or is it okay? He's with us.
Matt: Actually, no one seems to bat an eye at the large bear that's wandering inside.
Travis: But they give a shit about the goliath? That's fucked up.
Taliesin: One last question for our good friend at the gate.
Matt: Okay, as you walk past him.
Taliesin: One more thing, good sir. If you were going to find a place to sleep comfortably, quietly, and without incident for the evening in the city, is there a place that you would recommend to a friend?
Matt: "Well, best I can think, there are many fine establishments of rest where rooms can be rented throughout the entirety of the city. Depending on how much coin you have to give, I would say you could..." He thinks for a second as I look at my notes.
Taliesin: Where you would put a brother-in-law that you liked?
Liam: Medium to high.
Matt: "I would recommend within the Suncut Bazaar, you would find the Debt's Respite, the Shade, or the Corner Cove. All very fine establishments, and very well watched by the Hand."
Travis: The Hand?
Sam: Are you a member of the Hand?
Matt: "I am. Is this your first time in the city, then?"
Taliesin: It is absolutely, yes.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: What was the name of the district?
Laura: The Suncut Bazaar.
Marisha: Suncut Bazaar.
Matt: As he watches you guys enter, the gates closing behind you, you now see the incredible reveal of the interior of the mystical city itself. Streets of smooth cobblestone-like red pebbles lead your eyes to hundreds of visible, vertically-inclined buildings of reaching peaks and smooth, pointed rooftops as far as your eye can see across the cityscape. It's a city of vibrant color; you see nearly every home, storefront, and outhouse has some form of draping silks or painted mural to give it individual character, standing out against the rest of its neighboring abodes, creating a calming, beautiful symphony of really nothing, in the presentation of it all. The people are walking with purpose, and the sounds of foreign barking and shouts occasionally break the air. Welcome to Ank'Harel.
Taliesin: Let's get arrested right now!
Marisha: Fight!
Matt: What do you guys wish to do?
Sam: We need spice. We need to find out about this merchant guy.
Travis: Got to get laid.
Sam: We got to get laid. Every continent, right? That's our pact. (laughter)
Travis: There's nothing that doesn't mean it's a pact.
Taliesin: We're going to need to talk to some gentry. We're going to need to talk to a library.
Marisha: Well, we should probably start with a tavern.
Taliesin: And I should also mention, not just a tavern is available, but we do in fact have three titled people within our crowd, so we can actually talk to people of standing and note with very little difficulty.
Liam: Are we certain that that will hold any water on this continent?
Taliesin: It holds water on every continent. Only people who are not titled think it doesn't.
Sam: Should we split up into a couple parties? No? All right.
Taliesin: Let's find a tavern, find some rooms. Let's go to this bazaar.
Marisha: People tend to know things in taverns.
Taliesin: Get the word out of what we're looking for.
Sam: To the Suncut Bazaar!
Travis: Wait, what if there's a market, like an open farmer's market we could get some spice?
Laura: Yeah. As we look around, do we see any markets? Actually, the shopping district would be a wonderful place to look for--
Marisha: Is that in the Suncut Bazaar, or could we head that direction while we look?
Sam: Oi! Oi, you there, boy! (laughter)
Matt: As you glance over, you see walking down the street what appears to be two teenage boys, huddled together, wearing drab, ankle-length cloth robes. One of them has a purple shawl over their shoulders. The other has a hood up, and they're both carrying small satchels of fruit in their arms. They both stop and turn. They look curiously at the small gnome, the small, pale gnome in foreign clothes and adorned, beautiful armor that walks up to them in the street.
Sam: That looks like fine fruit. Where would you go to go shopping for things here, market-y things?
Matt: (muttered conversation) "You are a very small man."
Sam: I've heard that. It's a glandular condition. (laughter)
Matt: "I'm sorry to hear that."
Sam: Yes. My cross to bear. I've seen many medicine men about it, but they can't cure it, but many have recommended that I get a diet of vegetables and fruit. Where could I buy some, just like the kind that you have?
Matt: "This fruit is actually very difficult to find and come across. If you wish, you could purchase this batch."
Sam: Okay. I've seen this before. I'm not interested in buying from you. I just want a market or a bazaar or anything.
Matt: "Bazaar. You are looking for the Suncut Bazaar?"
Sam: Yeah, that!
Matt: "It is farther down that way. Look to the blue tower in the center of the city? Walk in its direction to the eastern skyline--"
Laura: I'm not looking in the direction. I'm keeping my eyes on them the entire time he's talking.
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Marisha: I'm desperately trying to commit every direction to memory.
Taliesin: I am so fearful that he's about to try and buy meth from children.
Laura: 20.
Matt: "Look for the strings of crimson flags that hang across the very street corners. That will signify the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar."
Sam: You're so helpful.
Matt: 20. They both seem confused, but also strangely enamored with this tiny man who's talking to them. No shifty behavior beyond that.
Travis: Their hands aren't moving into someone's pockets?
Laura: No.
Sam: Thank you so much, young men, for your help. Also, spice? (laughter)
Travis: Yes! Oh my god!
Taliesin: No!
Sam: Do you spice?
Marisha: Do you spice?!
Travis: Yo, you cool? You cool, dog?
Matt: (muttered conversation) "I don't know what you're talking about."
Sam: I'm not an authority. Do you spice? Spice it?
Matt: "I am sorry. I'm confused?"
Sam: It's cool. Ignore that part. Thank you so much. What do you think, a little spice?
Matt: He puts his hand out.
Sam: I flip him a coin.
Matt: He takes it. "Good luck finding your fruit."
Sam: Okay. Thank you.
Matt: And they both walk away, but at a slow pace, looking over their shoulder at you the whole way.
Sam: They seemed legit! They seemed like they were street kids.
Taliesin: What about that was legit?!
Sam: They're riffraff. They could know what spice is.
Taliesin: They were carrying fruit!
Sam: They look normal, but I've got a keen eye for these things. I was a kid on the street for a long time.
Liam: Sam? No joke, thanks for the ab workout. (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh god.
Travis: Fuck. That was great.
Taliesin: I can't.
Liam: (deep sigh)
Travis: Do we go in the direction?
Laura: We walk towards the Suncut Bazaar, keeping an eye out.
Matt: All right. As you guys continue deeper into the city, the sheer size of this town reminds you of a mirror universe form of Emon, in the way that the streets narrow and then open, and the liveliness of culture around you in its heyday, and it saddens you, because it reminds you of back when the city was at its prime, when you first arrived and made it a home for yourself. But at the same time, the energy is infectious, and you can't help but feel like there's a lot of interesting people, culture, and momentum all about you no matter where you seem to walk across these streets. Though the culture here appears to be far older than that of Emon that you've encountered; even the buildings and constructs range in ways that-- maybe not as old as Vasselheim, per se, but at least you can see that there's some variation to some of the abodes here that have been worn through time more so than any you have encountered in Tal'Dorei, for the most part. These decorated and intricate buildings fill the streets. You can see pride in their construction, and the smells of horses and hot desert air combine with various burning spice and sage that occasionally wafts through the air to your nostrils. The ever-changing exotic skyline occasionally grabs your attention. You see the distant shadow of what looks like a skyship docked at a sky port. You get looks of many citizens, expressions ranging from amusement to mistrust as you pass by, until you come upon a massive building that shines with the sunlight. Above you, you see a number of red flags that hang and drift, about five feet in length, these thin, draping pieces of silk that shift with the breeze, and you can see numbers of these strands across different roads, and it's at this point that you look up and realize that this is the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar. Looking off towards the left, and what you've been watching as you approach, there are this cluster of dark blue and purple towers of various widths marking a central place in the center of the city. In the center of them, there is one very large, cylindrical tower that rises up past them all into what looks like a chalice or a cup-like platform at the very top that is impossibly high amongst the rest of the structures here in the city. It seems to be a beacon or watchtower over the entirety of Ank'Harel. But your attention now, here in the Suncut Bazaar, as you step around the corner, you can see tents and storefronts and buildings and voices raised as different barkers are shouting out for their wares. You can see carts being drawn through the streets by horse and camel. You can see what appear to be dozens upon dozens of people coming through with small satchels and coming by and purchasing their necessities for the day. You can smell cooking meats and food in the distance. You can see street performers juggling, and distant music of buskers in the side of the street, playing various flutes and instruments: some you recognize, some you do not. You actually see a shawm. It catches your attention on the side of the street.
Sam: I need a new reed for that.
Matt: And here you are, amongst the Suncut Bazaar.
Travis: Can I whip around and see if anyone's following us?
Sam: Ooh, Dust of Tracelessness.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Hammer down! 14.
Matt: 14. No matter where you walk, eyes are on you.
Travis: I am a gorgeous man.
Matt: Most people you come around here, it seems a largely human population. Beyond that, you've not seen a single dwarf as you've walked through the city, but you have seen a number of dark-skinned halflings, a few half-elves. Not an elf has caught your eye since you've wandered through. You've seen a couple of tieflings that walk openly in this city, which is a rare thing from Emon. Even there, most tieflings generally are met with mistrust and prejudice in the street. Here, no one seems to pay mind or bother. You do see a few half-orcs, this team of half-orcs that are shouting out in a language that none of you understand. Some sort of sales pitch they're giving, and there's a few people gathered around them. This is a very wide variety of people that live in this city, and everyone seems to mesh together without issue or prejudice, but not one goliath has caught your eye, and you've caught the eyes of many. And wherever you walk, you can see the townspeople stop, and they don't gawk. They don't stare intently. They're more curious, but no one appears to be following you.
Laura: Are the shops here indoors, or are they outdoor tent markets?
Matt: There are a few that appear to go into buildings, but the majority of this, as you look at now the Suncut Bazaar itself, while it is a section of the city, it is mostly open sky and is probably hundreds of various tents, carts, pop-up stand-ups, and even the center of the street, blankets set out, with the various merchants there with their wares strewn across the ground, waiting for anybody to come and approach.
Laura: Do we see any spice merchants?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Liam: Also, while she's rolling, do we all see people eyeballing him?
Matt: Yeah. It's pretty easy to see, and most everyone's--
Travis: In love? Enamored? Jealous?
Laura: 11.
Matt: 11. You look around and ask a few people, and most everyone shrugs their shoulders or points you in an odd direction, and no immediate spice merchants catch your attention. You're still on the outskirts of the Suncut.
Marisha: Do there appear to be any fruit merchants?
Matt: There are a few, actually. Yeah. And it's interesting. In this very hot desert environment, and you understanding how most plant life exists, fruit should be pretty damn rare, and what fruit would make it here seems to be pretty dry and withered. But everything you come across here is very plump, beautiful, and fresh.
Taliesin: Life.
Marisha: Needs things to live.
Taliesin: Needs things to live.
Marisha: There's not many things, no. Can I go up to one of the fruit merchants?
Matt: You go up to what appears to be a woman, probably in her late thirties. Her hair is long past her shoulders, and these dark black, brunette waves that spray out like mermaid hair across her shoulders. As you approach, she eagerly reaches out. "You look like you are traveling here to Ank'Harel in search of beautiful, delicious fruits of which to whet your palate. Yes? Would you like for these fine apples, of which are the finest you could find?"
Marisha: Apples? Oh wow. I was looking for something a little bit more exotic. Something native to this land.
Matt: "Ah, well--" She takes the apples back. "What you'd prefer, then, would be the kurrak fruit." And she pulls out what looks like a mango, but the exterior of it is very rough, with these little spines all around it. "While it is difficult to hold, crack open for a delightful flavor. It is gentle. It is like a sweet water experience."
Marisha: That was very descriptive. Thank you.
Matt: "Of course."
Marisha: How much do I owe you for this?
Matt: "For this, that would be two silver pieces."
Marisha: Two silver. And how much, just for future reference, are the apples?
Matt: "The apples would go for one silver piece apiece."
Marisha: One silver apiece. That's pretty steep. Don't worry about it. Here you go. I give her a little extra.
Matt: "Thank you so much for your patronage. Anything else you would like?"
Marisha: I think I'm good, thank you.
Laura: I peek around her shoulder. Where would the Shade be?
Matt: "The Shade? The Shade would be-- it's hard to explain. Do you see that building over there with the dark green steeple?" And you glance off in the distance. You can see, layers back, there appears to be one spire, this very harsh point that has a dark green tint. "That is the roof of the Shade. That'd be what you're looking for."
Laura: Thank you so much.
Matt: "Not a problem."
Liam: I would like to walk by, and as I'm passing Vex, I'm going to do that thing where you walk past a friend and you do that sideways kick in the butt, and I'm going to go stand by Grog, and anybody I see giving him the evil eye, I'm going to match it back.
Matt: Okay. You watch as she walks away, she had her hands out to Vex, and as soon as Vex keeps walking away, she goes--
Marisha: I toss her a gold. She's with me.
Matt: "You are free to shop here any day you like."
Marisha: And what was your name?
Matt: She pulls the coin out and pops it away and says, "I am Shubad."
Marisha: Shubad?
Matt: "Shubad."
Marisha: Keyleth.
Matt: "A pleasure to meet you."
Marisha: A pleasure. Thank you so much.
Travis: Are any of the barkers talking about magic stuff?
Taliesin: I'm also looking for a soothsayer.
Liam: What do you want to see, a show?
Travis: Well, I don't know. It just seems so exotic.
Taliesin: Anything out of the ordinary and/or a soothsayer, card-reader, bones-reader, whatever they have that's like that.
Matt: Okay. Both of you make investigation checks as you look around and ask around.
Liam: And I don't like the way these folks are looking at big man, so I'm going to stay by him.
Matt: You stay close to Grog.
Laura: No going up from that. That's what it is.
Travis: Negative two. (laughter)
Sam: Is that true?
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: I am city-blind, apparently.
Laura: What are you looking for?
Taliesin: I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary, but specifically, a soothsayer, a card-reader, a bones-thrower.
Matt: Grog. Glancing about, you look to see something shine across the ground. As you rush up and find it, you find what looks to be a magically enchanted stone about that big. Rough around the edges, but the reddish color is brighter red than the rest of the stones on the ground, and you're sure that this may be exactly what you were looking for.
Liam: I'm watching him.
Travis: I quickly get on my hands and knees, and I start moving the sand around, looking for one just like it, just to make sure it's unique.
Matt: There are many red stones around it, as you press the bit of dust and sand gathered around the other cobblestones, but this one appears to be unique.
Travis: Oh! What does it taste like?
Matt: There's a hit of saltiness to the dust that has gathered in this vicinity.
Travis: I gave away my salt-lick rock!
Matt: You did. (laughter)
Liam: I take a moment to marvel at how a being of such ferocity and power can be such a doofus at the same time. It's amazing.
Sam: I'm going to plant myself at the end of two rows of the intersection and wait for people to walk by. And as they do, I say: Spice? Spice, spice, spice? You spice it? Spice, spice, spice?
Laura: Can I have seen Percy looking around?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Can I help him look?
Matt: Percival, what did you roll?
Taliesin: Where did it go? Investigation? I rolled a nine.
Matt: Yeah. It's funny. For all the preparation of being a noble and public speaking, you are utterly lost.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm terrible in urban areas. I've learned this. I get flustered.
Matt: The culture is so vastly different from what you're used to, and the people don't seem to really pay much mind to your relatively important outfit and presence, and you're lost at sea.
Taliesin: I've never rolled a decent investigation check. It has never happened.
Matt: Vex walks up to you.
Laura: What are you looking for, dear?
Taliesin: Beyond anything interesting. Everything is too interesting.
Laura: It's very colorful.
Taliesin: A soothsayer of some kind, perhaps. It might be a good way to start getting the word out of the sorts of things we're looking for.
Laura: What sorts of things?
Taliesin: We're looking for a cloak. We're looking for a merchant with one eye.
Travis: I found a rock!
Taliesin: And we're looking for rocks-- not anymore, I suppose. And those are usually the most trustworthy of the untrustworthy people you find in a city.
Laura: Investigation? 19.
Matt: 19. The two of you begin to meander around, look around. You see, after some wandering, what looks to be a single blanket set out with a small half-dome shade structure of various cotton cloths that have been layered and pinned to create this loose escape from the sunlight. And you see what appears to be an older man with a very long braided beard that goes past his belly-button. He sits there, sleeveless open shirt, baggy pants, no shoes, and before him a deck of cards that is laying in a stack, and he has his eyes closed with his hands resting at the ends of his knees.
Liam: It sounds like fun.
Laura: Want to walk up? Yeah?
Taliesin: You mind blowing a little bit of money on this?
Laura: No, actually.
Marisha: Are we all there?
Matt: Depends on if you guys want to follow.
Marisha: I'd like to follow.
Matt: Okay. as you guys are approaching, you over in the corner.
Sam: Spice it? Spice it? Fusaka!
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: A billion. Deception?
Matt: Deception, yeah.
Sam: 32.
Matt: This marks your ability to double-talk or subtly put out the vibes for an individual.
Liam: Why aren't you a crime kingpin?
Matt: Who knows what Scanlan's ultimate destiny is?
Taliesin: I have a song for your next playlist. I'm so excited.
Matt: After a few moments of you doing this and a few people walking away, looking frustrated and taken aback, partially by your visual form and the unexpected contents of your words, one man in his early twenties walking up, what looks to be a damp cloth wrapped loosely around the head to keep the head cooled under the sun's heat, walks up and leans in and goes, "You're asking about spice, yes?"
Sam: Yes, hard-to-find spice. I don't know if they have it in this particular bazaar. It takes a seller with a keen eye to identify it.
Matt: "Well, I know folks who are purveyors of many spices here. Please, what do you seek?"
Sam: It's not really something that I want to discuss out in the open, but we could take a walk and talk about it.
Matt: "Good, good. Lead on. We'll have a conversation as we go." As he stands back up after leaning down for you, you get a little glance at what appears to be a slightly pointed ear and what looks like a hint of a mustache that's grown through. Very similar in visual presentation as to your comrades: not full elf, not full human, though definitely a much darker shade due to the out-in-the-open lifestyle of Ank'Harel. You begin to walk with this figure through the street. We'll get to you in just a moment. So as you guys make your way to the older gentleman sitting on the ground, eyes closed.
Laura: We sit down in front of him.
Matt: His eyes are still closed.
Laura: Be pleased.
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Marisha: Be pleased.
Matt: "Be pleased." His eyes open, and you can see his eyes are snow-blind. They are clouded over with what would probably be terrible cataracts or something else that has caused him full blindness, but he stares past you as he opens his eyes. "So you wish to be read, then?"
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Yes.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "Five gold for my services."
Sam: (whispers) He won't know what you put in his hand!
Taliesin: You're not there.
Marisha: He will know. He's a fortune teller, for Christ's sake.
Liam: Five plumbing washers.
Laura: Should I put five or 15, for each of us?
Taliesin: Five, for the moment. He knows there's three of us.
Matt: He places it into a small side pouch. "What do you wish to be read for?" He takes the cards and begins shuffling.
Taliesin: We search for a garment. We search for a man.
Matt: His way of shuffling cards is interesting. As opposed to the usual like double shuffle, he picks up the deck in one hand and splits it and then shuffles it together. Turns it around, splits it, and then shuffles it together on each side. It's this weird boy with a crystal in Labyrinth, but with a card deck. It's wild. As he stays still, looking past all of you.
Taliesin: And we search for answers towards the future that we inevitably run to.
Matt: The shuffling stops, and he grabs the deck. "You search for a garment." And he takes two cards out and throws them across the center of the blanket for you guys. You guys step back and take a look. One of them appears to have a fire or a camp flame with smoke pouring up out of it, and the other one appears to have a storm, a torrent of water, and he goes, "This garment you seek. It looks to be in motion, moving. If you seek this garment here, may haste take you. Your second question." What were you saying in the second one?
Taliesin: We search for a man.
Laura: With one eye.
Taliesin: Well, I didn't say that far.
Marisha: A merchant warrior. Missing.
Taliesin: He doesn't need that. He's fine.
Matt: What did you say?
Taliesin: Oh, we search for a man.
Matt: Pulls up two more cards and throws them, and they land almost exactly in the same place as the other two cards that he tossed before. They scoot to a stop. One card appears to be mostly blank, except it carries some sort of a stylized symbol or letter that you don't recognize. And the other one appears to be a hand of cards stuffed within a pile of coin. "You seek this man, yet it is not a man you seek. To where the luck brings you, the answers lie." And he puts out his hand.
Taliesin: Five more. Five more.
Matt: "And the third question?"
Laura: Can I insight check him as he's reading the cards? See if his face twitches at all, if it looks like he's making shit up.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: 21?
Sam: Oh, the whispers! So many whispers. How are the Cowboys doing, Travis?
Travis: I stopped looking.
Sam: I can tell you how they're doing.
Liam: Sounds like a sad man right there.
Taliesin: Wait, let's consult the cards. That's the third question.
Travis: It's pre-season. Nobody playing right now.
Sam: Oh yeah, sure.
Taliesin: The cards say the Cowboys are not--
Sam: Hey, maybe you and me should go to a game sometime.
Travis: I would love to.
Laura: Okay. And the third question?
Taliesin: We move towards a conflict. What should we know? What should we be prepared for?
Matt: Pulls the two cards forward, throws them down, landing once again almost precisely on the same space as the last two tosses. They slide to a stop. One of them shows a chasm cracking in the earth, and the other appears to show a singular, sunken skull. "The path is to change historic, but many will fall as the transition is to take. Take your time wisely, for the hourglass runs quickly."
Laura: Goddamn it. Five more gold.
Matt: "Is this all of your questions?"
Taliesin: That will do, yes.
Matt: He bows his head ever so slowly towards you. "Then be pleased." And he takes the cards and shuffles them back into the deck, rights them into a perfect square with one quick move of his hand, and places them back in front, puts his hands back on his knees, and closes his eyes and puts his head down. There's a pause, and he reaches over and grabs a small, partially eaten apple and (chomp).
Laura: I as quietly as possible put another five gold in front of him.
Matt: His chewing stops, and he swallows. Reaches out, patting around it, and finds the gold coins. Puts it into a pocket. "You ask for one more question. What do you inquire?" (card shuffling)
Laura: Did I make the right choice?
Matt: Two cards land across the carpet before you. One of them shows upon it two hands joining, and the other one shows a symbol of a sun rising over a mountain range. He says, "You've made many choices, but the one you speak of brings unity and a new dawn."
Laura: Be pleased.
Matt: He nods. "Be pleased." Takes the cards up, shuffles them back into the deck, and sets it down. He goes back into his meditative trance.
Taliesin: I feel that was money well spent.
Marisha: I guess.
Laura: That was so cool!
Taliesin: Well, we know we do not necessarily look for a man, which is important. We know that time is even more of the essence than we first implied, and considering that almost every soothsayer I've ever met is as crooked as the day is long, the word is now out that we're looking for them.
Laura: Well, that's the Shade. Should we head that direction?
Taliesin: We should.
Laura: Grog?
Travis: Yeah?
Laura: Do you want to bring your rock?
Travis: My what?
Taliesin: We should grab Scanlan.
Liam: Where is he?
Matt: Scanlan is gone.
Liam: Well, shit.
Marisha: We need one of those leashes for him.
Liam: Shorthalt?
Taliesin: Let's maintain a certain level of plausible deniability.
Laura: Fuck.
Marisha: I come over the earrings. Scanlan? Just making sure you're okay, wondering where you are. No biggie. Just checking in.
Matt: As you're walking with your half-elvish friend down one of the nearby alleyways, you hear Keyleth speaking over the earring.
Sam: I say  I'm cool.
Taliesin: We're going to die. Let's get a room.
Travis: All right.
Matt: So you guys make your way towards the Shade?
Laura: Yes. Scanlan, we're heading towards the Shade. It's the big green tent. Follow?
Sam: (clicks tongue) Yeah.
Matt: Your half-elven compadre goes, "Are you all right?"
Sam: I'm cool. I'm cool on these desert nights, and I need something to warm me up at night, so that's why I was inquiring about this spice.
Matt: "Please, which spice are you seeking?"
Sam: It might not be entirely legal, but fusaka?
Matt: He nods. "It may take a bit of time. I know someone who could bring this, but I could not bring you to them. They'd have to bring it to you."
Sam: Where can we meet?
Matt: "Well, where are you staying?"
Sam: I'm staying outside of the walls in a small encampment, but I can meet him sometime tonight inside the walls.
Matt: "Where would you need to meet?"
Sam: How about where we first met, at that same intersection, or is that too busy?
Matt: "That is far too busy. It needs to be private, away."
Sam: I'm sort of a visitor here.
Matt: "If you want a place to stay, there is Luck's Run, the casino. There are back rooms there."
Sam: There's a casino?
Matt: "Yes."
Sam: Hells yes.
Matt: "There is the Debt's Respite Inn, which has its own grasp of lowlifes. Those are probably the best bets."
Sam: Let's meet in a room at the casino.
Matt: "The casino it is. Which room?"
Sam: The red room? I'm not familiar with this casino. I'll need some guidance.
Matt: "Wear a red shirt. He will find you in the casino."
Sam: Okay. That sounds good.
Matt: "All right. Hour past sundown, we'll find you there."
Sam: Tonight? What time?
Matt: "An hour past sundown."
Sam: Oh, sorry. I was thinking about the casino. Sorry.
Matt: "How much do you want?"
Sam: Oh my god. I'm not prepared for this!
Matt: He starts looking a little untrusting.
Travis: Be cool, man. Be cool.
Sam: Enough to get me through a week of heavy use. I want to go on a bender.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: A billion. More than before. 35.
Taliesin: How are you rolling that?
Matt: He gives you a look and bends down.
Sam: I've had a rough few weeks, and I need to get away from it all and go to that place--
Matt: He gets close to your face, interrupts you, and goes, "I mean this with all due respect: Being as small a man as you are, you have to be careful."
Sam: Don't tell me what to do. I can take it, all right? (laughter)
Sam: Let's just say that when I started using, I was your height. (laughter)
Matt: He backs off, hands up. He goes, "Very well. The amount you ask, I have no specific amount. I'd have to inquire, but I would say, to be safe, bring about 200 gold pieces with you. Just in case."
Sam: It'll be pure, not cut with anything else? I want the good stuff.
Matt: He looks at you, confused.
Sam: Am I buying cinnamon here?
Marisha: Might be.
Taliesin: It's going to be a living baby.
Sam: It's going to be a pound of turmeric!
Liam: Cardamom.
Sam: Yes. We have a deal. Let's shake on it.
Matt: He reaches out and takes your hand, and you shake. "Very well. Hour after sundown. Casino." He brings his cloth up and brings it up over his face for a second and darts into one of the nearby corners and vanishes.
Sam: Where did you guys go? Hello?
Laura: We're at the Shade!
Sam: Okay! I'm coming! Where is that? Shit, where am I? I ask around for the Shade.
Matt: You eventually find it.
Marisha: Scanlan, stop panicking. I can hear you hyperventilating.
Sam: I'm sorry, I've just never done anything that cool before!
Taliesin: And you still haven't.
Liam: The hell you haven't!
Sam: I just did a drug deal, guys!
Marisha: Scanlan, not over the speakers! Not over the phone line!
Laura: You have drugs with you?
Sam: No! I'll tell you later!
Taliesin: These earrings are tapped. You know that.
Sam: They could be listening! I'm coming to you!
Liam: Pike hears everything. (laughter)
Matt: You guys find your way to the Shade, and it's a large, circular sandstone wall that has a pointed tent roof above it held by a singular pole in the center. It is segmented into various rooms that have no ceiling, so everyone shares the same roof. This is what appears to be a lounge tavern, meaning there are drinks and wine served, but each room seems to have a carpeted and pillowed floor. Looks like there are beaded curtains and various draperies that separate each of the different rooms, and there's large, hookah-type tobacco pipes. It's very much just a relaxing lounge area.
Taliesin: There's hookah.
Marisha: There's hookah!
Taliesin: I've never tried hookah before.
Marisha: You've never tried hookah?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: The Earth Ashari are super into the hookah. It's really nice, yeah.
Taliesin: This is the only thing I actually know about this continent, is that there's tobacco.
Marisha: We should try it!
Laura: Did Scanlan get here yet?
Matt: Scanlan takes about five minutes or so, but eventually catches up to you guys.
Laura: Are we staying here? It's not very private.
Taliesin: It's not very private, and privacy is definitely higher on the list.
Laura: Can I find a patron that seems chill?
Matt: Yeah. You look around. You can see what looks to be a matronly older woman wearing some nicer dark purple and black clothing, who is sitting there with one big hookah next to her side, by herself, with a glass of wine to one of the sides, and is staring into space.
Taliesin: I can literally only see my mother when you describe this image, by the way. (laughter)
Taliesin: And only you and you know how funny that is, because it's sealed in there.
Laura: I walk up. Be pleased.
Matt: "Be pleased. Can I help you?"
Laura: Actually, just a small trifle. Are you staying here?
Matt: "Over the next few hours, yes."
Laura: Lovely. We're from out of town--
Matt: "You don't say."
Laura: Yes, and I've noticed the Shade is rather open. Do you know if the Corner Cove or Debt's Respite are quite as private as this, or do they have actual rooms?
Matt: "Both of those have rooms, yes."
Laura: Oh. Lovely.
Matt: "Do you have any other specifics or requirements?"
Laura: Are they far from here?
Matt: "Corner Cove is maybe two miles that way, but the Debt's Respite is about a mile that way."
Laura: Thank you. Sorry to bother you.
Taliesin: Should we put some cards on the table?
Laura: Some cards?
Marisha: I thought that's what we just did with that other guy.
Taliesin: We've been searching for a friend of ours, and it's been very complicated. She's got one eye. She's been around for quite a while.
Laura: She's a merchant in town. We've been looking for her.
Matt: "There are many merchants that live here."
Taliesin: Are there many merchants with one eye?
Laura: She's quite strong, actually.
Marisha: Some call her a warrior merchant.
Matt: "Warrior? If you're looking for warrior merchants, you're probably looking for the Scarbearers."
Taliesin: Yes, that sounds about right.
Laura: Yeah, she is a Scarbearer. Are they around here?
Matt: "Well, this definitely narrows down your search. The Debt's Respite is where you'll want to go. It's actually run by one of the heads of their ilk."
Marisha: Ilk?
Taliesin: Not an animal.
Matt: "Scarbearers. They're a bit of a rough-and-tumble lot."
Laura: Oh, are they?
Matt: "They hunt for coin, sell what else they find. Odd jobs. Some of them maybe not the most up and legal, but they work with a guarantee, and the head of their troop I think runs, or at least partially owns, the Debt's Respite."
Taliesin: Thank you. What are you smoking at the moment, by the way?
Marisha: I was just about to ask her the same thing!
Matt: "This? I don't know." Raises her hand, and one of the various workers there approaches with another bottle of wine. "Yes, may I help?" "What is this you put in here?" Blows it in her face. "That would be a Dusk Blossom Sage." Walks away. "Dusk Blossom Sage."
Taliesin: It's very fragrant.
Matt: "Pungent would be the world you're looking for."
Liam: I walk over to Keyleth and say  I've done this, but I don't think I knew what I was doing. Your people do this?
Marisha: Well, the Earth Ashari do, and the Fire Ashari sometimes.
Liam: You've done this.
Marisha: Yeah. I stayed with the Earth Ashari for a few months. You want to try? It's fun. It's very nice. It relaxes you. Oh, come on guys! We've got time!
Laura: Do we?
Marisha: We never take time for ourselves. Come on!
Laura: We've got a ticking time bomb!
Marisha: Just 15 minutes!
Taliesin: The cards said our luck. Perhaps this is a good way to ignite it.
Marisha: 15 minutes. Please, Vex, pretty please!
Taliesin: We are still waiting for Scanlan to get here, and then we'll take him to the next stop.
Matt: Scanlan, by the way, is right behind you.
Sam: Hi!
Marisha: Scanlan!
Sam: Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on you.
Liam: Now we really need to do it.
Laura: We do need to talk to him, actually. Do you mind if we join you? I motion to the waitress. Could we have some more Dusk Sage?
Travis: Something stronger.
Matt: You see her eyes roll. "I mean no offense, but this is my 'me' time."
Laura: Oh, of course!
Marisha: Let's get our own! We'll get our own little booth.
Taliesin: I'm going to put a gold coin on her tray. So you can keep smoking, and thank you for the time spent in our company.
Matt: She takes the coin, flicks it back to you and goes, "I appreciate, but do not require your patronage."
Taliesin: I'm grateful for your time.
Sam: Yeah. I like her.
Taliesin: Thanks, mom. It is burned into my head.
Travis: Getting our own?
Laura: Yeah, we go get our own.
Matt: You guys are brought into one of the small sections of the Shade. You are given your choice of various tobaccos. While it's not a large room, per se, you can all comfortably lounge in there. It's a nice place to get away. You can hear the distant sounds of the city, but for the most part, there's a soft violin music that plays towards the center of the area, so at least it has a nice atmosphere to it.
Travis: As we're in there, do we notice anyone with any large scars walking around?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: This'll go great. 12.
Matt: You see people with small, large scars. People with scars all over. Life out here can be a little tough at times, but no more scarred than most of the people you've encountered in your lifetime. And definitely nowhere near as scarred as the people you've run with for half of your lifetime.
Travis: There are no really large, scarred people in here.
Laura: Good to know. Thank you, Grog.
Taliesin: Good to know.
Laura: Good to know.
Liam: Hey, can I see that ruby you found before?
Travis: I have no ruby.
Liam: You'd hold out on me?
Travis: Nope. There was no ruby.
Liam: Why are you lying to me, Grog?
Travis: Look, Little Teeny is my friend. All right? He spoke to me out of the deserts of fate, and he is mine and mine alone.
Liam: All right.
Laura: Scanlan.
Sam: Oi.
Laura: Spice dealer?
Marisha: Yes, I want to hear this story.
Sam: I made contact. I'm supposed to meet up tonight in the casino one hour after sunset. I'm supposed to wear red. I will not lie, I am shitting myself, I'm so nervous.
Laura: Are you going to wear red?
Sam: Well, how else will they discern who I am? I don't want to go alone.
Laura: Well, I'll go with you.
Sam: Are you cool?
Laura: Of course I'm cool. I'm so cool, darling.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm cool!
Marisha: Me, too!
Sam: Well...
Taliesin: No, what do you mean? We're cool.
Sam: I don't want to draw too much attention, but I want to be safe.
Travis: (loudly) Are you buying drugs? (laughter)
Taliesin: Could not be happier.
Liam: What an episode! What an episode.
Taliesin: There's so many valuable lessons that can be learned at any moment.
Laura: Do you think maybe the reason Jarett was almost arrested was because of this fucking spice?
Taliesin: I think that's precisely what happened.
Laura: What the hell was he thinking?
Sam: But we're going to do it smarter. We're going to do it better.
Taliesin: No, we're not! (laughs) He's legitimately smarter than us.
Sam: I can do this. I am the one who cocks. (laughter)
Sam: I can do this. But I need some backup. Maybe Vax could come and he could wear red. And he could be the guy who--
Laura: Aren't they going to be looking for a very little man?
Sam: Okay, I'll wear the red, but maybe you could be there.
Liam: I will go with you, and I will hang back, and I will be there to stab out the eyes of anyone who wants to hurt you, but you are the talker, man. You've always been the talker.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Why does Scanlan never think I'm very cool? Why does he think that?
Sam: No, I think you're great.
Laura: You never want me to go with you, I could've helped you find Kaylie, and you didn't ask me to.
Liam: Well, let's be real. She's the coolest one in the group, really.
Sam: The big pointy hat, it's really dorky.
Laura: You're the one who fucking makes me wear this thing!
Sam: I know!
Liam: Can she take it off at the casino, though?
Laura: I'm not flying. I can take it off whenever I fucking want!
Travis: Can we all come? It sounds super dangerous. I just want to watch. I'll be so sly.
Taliesin: We are, by the way, walking to our next destination.
Marisha: No, I am enjoying my hookah.
Taliesin: Oh, I forgot we got hookah. Oh my god.
Laura: We're sitting and hookah-ing through this whole fucking thing.
Liam: I did it before, but I don't think I really did it.
Marisha: Is this a split hose? We have a split hose.
Sam: No, thanks. I'm straight-edge tonight. I've got to think clearly.
Marisha: It's just tobacco, Scanlan.
Taliesin: Is it just tobacco? We really don't actually know.
Marisha: Actually, that's a good point. I do a few test puffs. Is it just tobacco? Is there something special about this hookah?
Matt: It seems to be just delightfully flavored tobacco.
Marisha: It's nice! So okay, you don't want to inhale all at once. It's more like flavor thing. Like a cigar.
Liam: Yeah. I copy Keyleth. (coughs)
Marisha: Vax. Come on.
Laura: Good job, brother. Good job.
Travis: What happened to you?
Liam: I just, (coughs, sniffs) I can't stop (coughs) coughing. (coughs) I'm fine.
Marisha: Wow. This is cute, actually. This is adorable. I hand him some water from my pouch. Just a little dry.
Liam: (coughs) It's really good.
Laura: Wow, you've never looked cooler in your entire life.
Liam: I agree with you.
Travis: Is there a bar in this place? A proper bar?
Matt: Not really a bar. It seems the servants take orders and bring you your various liquid imbibements.
Travis: Right. Can I flag down a--
Matt: Yeah. You see a man walks up to you, long dark curly hair, bit of a goatee growing. "How can I help you?"
Travis: Yeah, I'm royalty from a far-off land. I pride myself on trying the fiercest spirit in the area that I'm visiting. What do you guys pride yourself on?
Matt: "You want the Sandkheg's Hide."
Travis: The sandcake side?
Matt: "The Sandkheg's Hide."
Travis: Oh, hide. Oh, is it a food or a drink?
Matt: "It's a drink."
Travis: Yeah, then one of those'd be great.
Matt: "It's expensive."
Travis: Yeah, well, don't tell anybody but I'm super fucking rich. Only because I have to check with my national treasury, how much is it?
Matt: "Ah, do you wish to have a glass or a bottle?"
Travis: A bottle.
Matt: "A bottle will run you 350 gold pieces."
Sam: Oh!
Travis: I'll take two.
Matt: Walks off.
Taliesin: How have we not stopped this?!
Matt: Comes back with two very full-- (laughs)
Laura: That's from your personal fucking funds!
Travis: We be clubbing, motherfuckers.
Laura: That ain't no party funds.
Taliesin: Those are gold coins. You're not making it rain, you're making it hail, for god's sakes.
Marisha: Does that get to come with us, or is it bottle service? Because if this is bottle service, we're here for the night.
Travis: Okay, maybe there's champagne though, yes?
Matt: He comes back a little later with these two dark green glass wine bottles that have this heavy leather wrapped around them and bolted together at certain places. It looks like leather at times, but as you get closer, you feel it's actually hard. It's almost like a chitinous armor on the outside of the glass.
Travis: This was meant for me.
Matt: Both of these vials are given to you with heavy corks that are wax-coated over the top. "Here you are."
Travis: Oh! May I start a tab? No? Fine. Then I give, shit. (mutters) How much do I owe?
Laura: 700. TRAVIS 700. Here's 800 gold.
Sam: Oh my god.
Matt: "Thank you very much, and please, do let me know if you require anything else."
Travis: No problems.
Matt: And he exits the room.
Taliesin: I have never hated you so much before, in my entire life.
Travis: Prepare to drink like kings.
Liam: I feel the opposite way. I'm very proud.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah. Grog, I think this bottle's more well-armored than we are.
Travis: Yeah, it's like amazing animal-skin Maker's Mark. So how do we crack this bitch open?
Sam: Guys, I need you to be clear-headed tonight!
Taliesin: I'm having a glass of this. We've just paid a fortune for it.
Laura: We're saving a bottle.
Taliesin: We are saving a bottle.
Travis: Right. Are there any opening utensils around, because I don't want to unsheathe--
Taliesin: May I sword it?
Matt: You may.
Taliesin: I'm going to sword it.
Laura: But don't take your sword out, because we're not allowed to bring our weapons out.
Taliesin: Oh, there's no weapon in here?
Matt: You're currently private in the room.
Taliesin: Oh, we're private in the room.
Marisha: I thought this was an open tent-commune thing.
Matt: It's an open ceiling, but there are rooms segmented by cloth and what looks like sandstone walls, so there are little pockets and alcoves, and you guys currently have one that you're in right now.
Taliesin: It's not no weapons, it's just no usage of them.
Liam: Let's keep them sheathed, he said at the gate. But we are pretty hidden.
Taliesin: I'll just pop it.
Matt: Comes off, and the cork flies and bounces off one of the nearby walls. The smell that comes to you is extremely strong. It resembles a very vinegar turned wine mixed with this, for lack of a better term, a very earthy scent. It's almost herbal, medicinal. It's not at all what you would have expected for something so expensive.
Travis: Who wants to be first? Keyleth?
Marisha: Fill me up. Oh wait, you want me to go first?
Laura: I want a shot.
Travis: You want a shot?
Sam: Percival just took some.
Matt: As it touches your tongue, that smell transitions into a very acidic taste. It actually burns your tongue, and it goes numb within a matter of seconds. It is not a delightful flavor, and as the tongue goes numb, the back of the throat goes numb as you swallow. As the numbness continues down the rest of the body, the flavor has not improved at all, but it brings this universal numbness. And as the slight pain of the burn subsides, you, with just but a few sips, become extremely intoxicated, but also just numb.
Liam: How is it?
Marisha: How is it?
Taliesin: (slurring) Not very good.
Laura: Oh shit.
Taliesin: (slurring) But if--
Laura: Oh, he's fucking wasted.
Marisha: I slap him.
Taliesin: (slurring) You should do that again. That felt really good. I'll do it.
Laura: Oh shit.
Sam: Liquid MDMA.
Marisha: I take a sip.
Laura: I'm not drinking mine. Here, Grog.
Marisha: I want to know! I take a sip.
Matt: You take a sip, and the same sensation takes, and the numbness sets in, this slight vibration at the back of the skull. Elements of this remind you of being very drunk, with but a few sips.
Liam: Hey, can you hear me? Yeah? You all right?
Marisha: (slurring) Oh holy shit.
Marisha: (slurring) This is so weird.
Taliesin: (slurring) This is so weird.
Marisha: (laughs)
Taliesin: (slurring) We're good.
Liam: I take them by the cheeks. Can you feel this?
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Yeah!
Liam: You can?
Marisha: (affirmative grunt)
Liam: Can you feel this?
Taliesin: (affirmative grunt)
Marisha: (affirmative grunt)
Travis: Does it taste good?
Taliesin: (dissenting grunt)
Marisha: (dissenting grunt)
Liam: Do you recommend it?
Taliesin: (non-committal grunt) (laughter)
Marisha: (non-committal grunt) (laughter)
Travis: (high-pitched) It hurts man, oh my god!
Laura: Are you going to try it, Grog? (laughter)
Liam: I am not going to have a sip of that right now. Definitely sometime, but--
Laura: Back in the mansion, maybe.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: But not when we have to do something tonight.
Taliesin: (slurring) What do we have to do?
Laura: As charming as you two are right now.
Travis: I'm going to stopper it and then I'm going to put the extra bottle in the Bag of Holding.
Sam: You didn't have any?
Travis: Nope.
Liam: Just these two?
Travis: (laughing) Money well spent!
Laura: Can I step out and find that waiter that we paid for?
Liam: Yeah, you're both really cute right now, but you're useless.
Marisha: I lean on Vax a little bit.
Laura: Wonderful beverages you just served us. How long does that last?
Matt: "Depends on how much you're drinking."
Laura: Just a tiny bit.
Matt: "Hour, maybe."
Laura: Fabulous. They came with quite a price tag, didn't they?
Matt: "'It's very dangerous to harvest and create, yes."
Laura: I could assume. What exactly is in?
Liam: Yes, what are they harvested from?
Matt: He thinks a minute, then goes, "I don't know which part of the sandkheg it is, but it is taken from the usually venomous bile or spittle of the creature."
Taliesin: (slurring) That's really good bile!
Travis: It's a living thing.
Laura: I'm assuming, I mean, back in the city that we're from--
Matt: "Mind you, it is refined and pickled by the finest of various-- It is a delicacy across Ank'Harel and northern areas of Marquet. I was merely fulfilling the request of your companion."
Taliesin: (slurring) No, it's very good.
Laura: Thank you so much. Where we're from, usually when purchasing such a great and expensive item, room service is included. I'm assuming we have somewhere to stay for the night?
Taliesin: (slurring) I don't think that it's that kind of place.
Matt: "I mean, you are welcome to stay, should you pay an evening price, yes, but that is not part of the price of the drink of which you have purchased, no."
Laura: Oh. Cultural differences! Good to know.
Taliesin: (slurring) We have to move.
Liam: Hey. Can you say your full name right now?
Taliesin: (slurred) Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo the third of Whitestone.
Sam: Don't say the W word!
Taliesin: (slurring) Whitestone?
Sam: Okay, it's fine now.
Taliesin: (slurring) What? (shushing)
Travis: How long until you have to meet this guy at the casino?
Taliesin: (slurring) Why're you talking? Just (shushes).
Sam: What time is it? Has the sun gone down?
Matt: No, you guys woke up maybe two and a half hours ago.
Taliesin: Day drinking! Yes!
Matt: You're maybe getting close to noon. The sun, last you saw before you got here, was close to the center of the sky.
Travis: Well, we've got time to kill, right?
Laura: We need to go find the Debt's Respite and maybe get a room.
Sam: Is that where we're going to sleep tonight?
Laura: That's where the Scarbearers are. We can get a room here.
Liam: And your deal is this evening, yes?
Sam: Yeah, we've got some time for that.
Travis: So we take off for the Debt's Respite.
Matt: Okay. Who's leading the charge for that?
Travis: No, you're not. I will.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation check, if you don't mind.
Sam: Investigation. You're terrible at those.
Marisha: (laughing) This is everything I wanted.
Taliesin: I'm so happy right now.
Laura: 26.
Matt: 26 investigation check. Within ten minutes you've asked the right questions between a number of various street urchins and street salespersons, to be directed straight towards the Debt's Respite.
Sam: I wrote it down correctly, Matt.
Matt: In following the direction, you end up walking up to what looks like a rather rundown-looking establishment. The broken glass windows and missing front door lead you to think that perhaps it's been abandoned for months. Looks a little rough and ramshackle.
Laura: But they said this was being guarded by the Hand of Ord. Interesting.
Sam: My contact in the underworld said that this was a place that is a known hangout for seedy types. Right? Am I remembering that correctly?
Laura: No, the guard at the front of the city told us this was one of the places that you could stay, and it was guarded.
Matt: He said it was a place you could stay, because you were asking for taverns and inns.
Liam: We have accounts from two different people, and they're two different opinions.
Taliesin: It's like Yelp. But better. I'm going to knock. (knocking)
Matt: As you approach the front door, it's partially ajar and as you push it open, you can see the inside is a whole different story. As your eyes adjust to the interior you find actually a bustling business of barhands slinging tankards across seven stained wood tables, some of the folk look rather day-drunk, similar to these individuals, though it has worn a bit off since the original sip. And most look to be various miscreants or post-work farmers taking a break. The interior is familiar and probably closer to the taverns you're used to in more of the poorer districts of Emon and surrounding cities than some of the more luxurious areas you've recently found yourselves in. Vax, Vex, and Keyleth-- actually, Keyleth, make a perception check with disadvantage.
Marisha: Aw. I see why you're doing that. With disadvantage?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: 17.
Matt: Okay. Vex and Vax, as you guys walk into the room, you do catch off in the distance behind a series of barrels that are stacked and the edge of a shelf that contains rows and rows of glasses, tankards, plates, and various things. You just barely make out what looks to be an androgynous figure, face masked with dark blue and black cloth, with a hint of leather armor, hiding in the corner. Like barely visible to you and you can make out the details due to your very keen ability to gather your surroundings quickly.
Liam: Is the armor similar to that suit of armor we saw on the other guy?
Matt: Nope. This is very muddled, low leather armor.
Laura: Are they wearing a cloak?
Matt: Can't tell; their back's hidden, and they're quiet.
Laura: So they don't have something up? Do they have a hood over their head?
Matt: They have a hood and a mask. Looks to be like a cloth mask wrapped around him.
Liam: I'm going to hang by the two sobering-up twins over here and keep an eye on that person.
Matt: You guys also watch throughout all the various patrons and people that are wandering about this establishment, one figure stands out amongst the others. You see a bronze-scaled dragonborn: bulky and thick, muscular armored in light hides and bracers. He clutches an untouched mug that is brimming with an amber-colored ale and is lost in thought, staring off towards one of the broken windows that leads outside. Very heavy, muscular arms. Maybe not quite the height of Grog, but definitely a similar build.
Laura: Tail or no tail?
Matt: Sitting down, you can't tell.
Liam: You don't know.
Matt: What do you guys do?
Taliesin: (slurring) We're fine.
Laura: Wow. I guess I walk up to the tavernkeep.
Matt: There is no tavernkeep. There are barmaids walking around and passing drinks, but there is no barkeep right now.
Laura: I grab one of the barmaids. Who do we speak to about a room?
Matt: "You would speak to Treev," and points to the dragonborn, who is currently staring out of the window.
Laura: Oh. Well, there we go. I walk over.
Travis: I go with her.
Matt: He's spacing out. As soon as you approach he goes, (groans) "What do you want, bothering a fellow in mid-fantasy?"
Laura: Sorry, sir.
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Laura: We're interested in a room for the night, actually.
Matt: "All right, well, what's your name?"
Laura: Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "Vex'ahlia. Treev. Treev Bonebreaker." And grabs your arm. As opposed to a handshake, like a full-on forearm, meaty grasp. Treev. T-R-E-E-V. "Treev Bonebreaker. Current caretaker of this fine establishment. Looking for rooms? I've got three available."
Laura: Wonderful. Mind if I sit down?
Matt: "At this rate, sure. I doubt I'm going to find myself back to that dream. Anyway, what do you and your rather scrawny-looking friend there have to say?"
Travis: I look around.
Laura: We're actually here on a rather important mission from Emon.
Matt: "Never been there."
Laura: It was quite a beautiful city. Not as much anymore.
Matt: "Well, that's unfortunate. Sometimes cities fall to the lowest despots. It happens."
Laura: Yes, it does.
Matt: "Rooms?"
Laura: Yes. Three, you said?
Matt: "Three rooms available."
Laura: And how much would those rooms be?
Matt: "How many are staying?"
Sam: Six.
Laura: Six of us?
Matt: "And your bear?"
Laura: Well, yes, but he doesn't take up much space.
Matt: "Well we have to put a bear tax on this, you realize."
Laura: "A bear tax?"
Matt: "Yes. I haven't had a bear here before. Who knows what damage it can do? Consider it protection."
Laura: You know what? He can sleep outside, don't worry. Don't worry about the bear.
Matt: "All right. I take no responsibility what happens to your bear outside."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: "That'll run you ten gold per room. 30 gold for the night."
Laura: (whispers) Ten gold? (louder) Are these really fancy rooms, then?
Matt: "No. God no. I don't know where you're from in Emon or what the prices are there, but here, it's expensive."
Laura: Every fucking thing is expensive here.
Taliesin: Can I attempt to start looking around the room to try and find anything interesting and try and be useful?
Matt: Make an investigation check with disadvantage.
Laura: Can I insight and see if he's just taking fucking advantage of us because we're tourists? I don't want to roll that one. I want to roll this one.
Taliesin: Investigation? 12.
Laura: Natural 20!
Marisha: Oh shit.
Matt: Yeah, he straight-up jacked the price up. He can see the foreigner on your face.
Laura: You know what? We probably don't need the three rooms. They offered us some over at The Shade. It's fine.
Matt: "Certainly. Whatever your business may be. Is that all you need?"
Laura: Are you from Tal'Dorei?
Matt: "Me? No. Not originally."
Laura: No.
Matt: "Why?"
Laura: So you haven't heard of Draconia? Can I see from here if he has a tail or not?
Matt: There is no tail behind him.
Laura: Have you heard?
Matt: "Of Draconia? Unfortunately."
Laura: Have you heard what happened?
Matt: "No."
Laura: Draconia has fallen.
Matt: Grabs his drink that he's holding up, slams it on the table. It spills over. "You fucking with me?"
Laura: No.
Matt: "Well, there's a reason for celebration." And just chugs the entire drink in one go, you can see his dragonborn gullet just accepting the entire drink in one gulp. (sighs)
Laura: Well, I'd be happy to tell you more detail for a reasonable price on the rooms.
Matt: (laughs) "Sit down. All of you. 15 gold for the lot. All the meaty details. Sure."
Laura: So we tell him.
Matt: You tell him about everything, and he listens in. He starts enjoying it, and eventually falls a bit, sinking in the stake of things, and eventually that celebration falls to acceptance.
Taliesin: Does anyone mind if I fill him in on the future of Draconia?
Sam: If you do it in a slurry speech, sure.
Taliesin: It's going to be slightly slurry, but at this point at least I'm English again. We have the next several weeks we were going to attempt to free the populace from their new lord and master. But in order to do that we are here on a mission. We're searching for something. We're searching for a one-eyed merchant warrior, and a cloak.
Matt: "Well look, if you're looking to hire, you've got to explain the task then. We do have a code. Fuck what the rumors say."
Taliesin: I've never found anyone who doesn't have a code who lived very long to tell about it.
Matt: "Aye. Long enough. What's the point in living without one? That's how you end up shivved in the stomach and left to bleed in the street. What you looking to hire for?"
Taliesin: We are looking for the one-eyed merchant warrior who wears the coat of Cabal's Ruin.
Matt: "I know who you're seeking, aye. Mistress Asharru."
Taliesin: Mistress Asharru?
Marisha: We have a name! Goddamn it.
Matt: "She's one of our finest, and expensive because of it. But friend, she's been off for a week since her last job, so mayhaps her schedule is open. Would have to inquire. Write me a summary of your job you have for her. I'll have it delivered. Her answer may take a week or so."
Taliesin: We do not have, sadly, a week or so. The dragon falls in two weeks.
Matt: "Well, write her a letter, she'll receive it, and she'll return to you when she sees it fit. Our business is our business. If you don't like it, shove off, find someone else."
Taliesin: Sadly no one else will do. Not that I want to inquire of the sort of business she's in, because that's inappropriate, but is she in the town at least? If we were to write her, could we get word to her quickly?
Matt: "Why, I can get word to her immediately, but it's up to her when she wants to respond."
Taliesin: Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
Matt: He starts giving you a curious look and goes, "You come in here asking to hire one of my finest and don't know what work she does?"
Taliesin: I know what work she does.
Matt: "What work do you need her for?"
Taliesin: We need to save the world.
Matt: "And you need her help to save the world."
Taliesin: Sadly, but true. We at the very least need her blessing.
Laura: While he's talking, can I keep an eye on the figure in the corner?
Matt: Yeah. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: There are things that have been released upon this earth that will burn everything. And they will make their way here. Draconia is gone. Tal'Dorei is gone. All swaths of civilization have been wiped off the earth.
Matt: "We've weathered beasts. We've weathered dragons here in Emon."
Taliesin: Not like we've seen.
Matt: "So be it. But nevertheless, you want to hire her, you've got to write her a proposal." And he slides across a piece of parchment with a small quill about it. "I'll deliver it, and she'll get back to you when she sees fit."
Sam: Does she have a normal price?
Matt: "Depends on the job you're asking. She'll set her price."
Sam: Okay.
Laura: 30 perception.
Matt: 30 perception? The figure is watching all of you intensely but has not moved an inch. All you've seen are the eyes move, but they've been trained on your entire group since you arrived.
Liam: I've been watching.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Could I ask, (coughs) other than gambling, what sort of entertainment can you find in this city?
Matt: "All sorts of entertainment. There's various singers, musicians, dancers, performers. If you're looking for company there's all sorts of entertainment in that regard, of all the spectrums. If you're looking for games, probably a few months out before we get to any sort of the gladiatorial events."
Travis: I'm sorry, could you just, a bit more on--
Matt: "That's months away."
Liam: There's no place for our friend to get into a scrap?
Matt: "Well, you could certainly find a scrap, but none that are sanctioned by the Hand, and they'll put you away."
Liam: Sorry, big man.
Matt: "Lest you have someone to duel you. That's a whole different business."
Travis: What? Duel?
Matt: "That's sanctioned by the law."
Travis: A duel? A one-on-one duel?
Matt: "If you challenge one to a duel and they accept, aye."
Travis: In this city, it's legal? Anytime? High noon, midnight, when?
Matt: "You just have to sanction it by the Hand. You have to make sure that you both agree to fight to the death, and the fight has to happen in the Bowl of Judgment."
Travis: The Bowl of Judgment?
Sam: The Bowl of Judgment?
Matt: "Sits about the Sandherald district outside of the Cerulean Palace."
Travis: Wait, is that that super fucking tall thing we saw?
Matt: "That's the Cerulean Palace. It's quite close to it, aye."
Laura: Are any items allowed in the bowl, or do you have to go in bare-handed?
Matt: "It depends on the sanctions of the Ord and the agreement you come to, but fisticuffs are great for the gladiatorial events, but if you're fighting to the death, sometimes it's nice to bring a blade in."
Marisha: So what type of people like to participate in these duels?
Matt: "The kind that got nothing to lose. The kind that got a point worth proving with their life. Those kind. Doesn't happen often. When it does happen, it's a spectacle."
Taliesin: Is there like a lighter fight that can be found?
Sam: Arm wrestling match.
Taliesin: Arm wrestling or-- I don't know, what would be worse less than--
Laura: UFC.
Marisha: Less than a Bowl of Judgment?
Sam: Cup of Truth? (laughter)
Taliesin: A Wok of Truth, maybe.
Marisha: Bowl of Wheaties.
Liam: Tablespoon of Wrath. (laughter)
Taliesin: This is really uncomfortable.
Matt: "A few months until the games begin, but until then, that's about the only way you'll find bloodshed here. At least that won't lend you up in prison."
Travis: All right.
Sam: Good to know.
Laura: Good to know.
Taliesin: I'm sitting and I'm starting to compose a letter.
Laura: How's his handwriting?
Taliesin: Flouncy.
Matt: You're starting to gain it back. What do you write?
Taliesin: I'm going to show everybody before I hand it in. I'm going to write the truth, top to bottom, of the world is peril, we are facing a battle, and she holds or knows of an item that would turn the tide, and I wish to know its price or know its rental.
Marisha: Wow.
Sam: What are you asking her?
Marisha: I feel like that's not going to work.
Taliesin: I'm holding it. Before I hand it in I'm going to show. I don't feel that there is any deceit-- there is nothing I can think to say beyond the truth. We are either dealing with honest people, or we are not.
Marisha: I have a feeling that... yeah.
Laura: What if we just--
Taliesin: I'm also putting my rank and title and letting them know that I'm willing to--
Sam: Give away Vex's title?
Taliesin: I'm willing to give away Vex. Vex is entirely up for sale. No.
Travis: You're planning to recruit this person?
Taliesin: I'm not looking to recruit this person. I'm looking to rent or buy an object that she owns, or perhaps even trade, and we'll put 400 gold.
Marisha: Just to meet with her?
Laura: Just to meet with her.
Taliesin: As an offer of a meeting.
Liam: That's not bad.
Marisha: That's not bad.
Matt: He takes it. He packages in in a small container, a leather container.
Marisha: Did you put in there that it had to be prompt? That it had to be prompt?
Taliesin: And that time is of the essence.
Matt: "Oh, don't worry." (whistles) Whistles through his fingers and the figure in the wall that you'd been watching steps forward and slowly walks towards the table. Holds up the scroll, and the figure leans in. Covers his mouth and he whispers into the ear of the figure. The figure takes the scroll, gives a nod to all of you, and walks out of the tavern. "He'll deliver that to her promptly, now be on your way. 15 gold."
Laura: Oh yes, of course! Thank you for the rooms.
Matt: Takes a keyring out and starts fudging through the keys, pulls a few off and tosses them to you across the table. "All right, you've got it for a night."
Liam: I heard Grog. I'm going to follow out the door, go stealth.
Matt: Okay. You vanish out the door. Make a perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22. Okay. As you glance out the door and pull outside-- you're going stealth as well, you said? Roll stealth.
Liam: That is 25.
Matt: 25. Okay. You turn around the corner just as you see a flash of dark cloth around the edge of the Debt's Respite. You rush off to the edge and look around the corner way and down the alley. You can see the figure, full on, arms out to the side rushed behind, going into a very fast run, down the shaded hallway.
Liam: Shaded hallway?
Matt: The alleyway.
Liam: I'll follow.
Matt: Okay, so you continue to follow.
Liam: At a distance.
Matt: All right. Following the masked figure, you continue to give chance. It darts erratically, zig-zagging between areas. You can see this is a very trained pattern to lose anybody following them, but you're also trained in following those that wish not to be followed. Make another perception check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: You come around one corner, and you can see there's a wall that ends there, and you see just a little slip of material pass. And as you glance over, you can see the figure has jumped down onto a lower walkway onto what appears to be a recessed sector of this part of Ank'Harel, and has already darted beneath a nearby bridge and overpass that walks across to another series of buildings. You leap over, keeping in the shadow, and give chase down that way. You turn around underneath the bridge and you can see underneath the bridge, there is an archway that leads into a dark path down an actual hallway beneath the series of buildings you just saw ahead of you. Make another perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22. You look down the hallway, and you see the shadow of the figure framed against what looks to be another opening on the opposite side but the sunlight is coming through. You can just see the dark outline as it darts forward and then leaps off again, down the right past that exit. You follow, and you look off the side just as you see the figure slink behind one large crate next to a storage section outside of a warehouse. It ducks behind another one. Darts up to a building that looks to be shuttered and closed. It looks like a furniture store with a little sign at the top that says, "A Kingly Home." It moves an empty rain barrel to the side and slips the leather case through a hole that was previously hidden by the barrel, dropping it inside the building, slides the barrel over it again. Looks back and forth. Make another stealth check.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. Doesn't seem to make notice, and then darts off, leaping, leaping up onto a rooftop and vanishing off.
Liam: You said, "A Kingly Home"?
Matt: A Kingly Home.
Liam: I'm going to stealth back to the Debt's Respite.
Matt: Keeping a very close watch on the path you took and marking it mentally back to the Debt's Respite. It's probably a good mile off from where you guys were, if not a little further. You guys continue your conversation, go about your own business. Eventually, Vax returns with the information, the path of wherever this letter was dropped off to.
Travis: Just curious, have you ever had the Sandkheg Hide?
Matt: "Are you serious?"
Travis: Yeah. I'm just asking.
Matt: "No, I ain't drinking that bullshit."
Travis: Really?
Matt: "Yeah."
Travis: Too stiff for you?
Matt: "Too stiff for anyone! It's-- what?"
Travis: I mean, I hear only real bosses can drink that jazz.
Matt: "That's not a drink. That's probably squeezed from the arsehole of some sort of beast out in the desert. I prefer my stuff taken from berries and the sweet stuff."
Travis: What do you mean, some beast? Who'd make a drink out of some animal's whatever?
Matt: "Have you have some, have you tasted it?"
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: "Then I guess you know what an animal's bum tastes like, eh?"
Travis: (sputters) Hold on. You mean they squeeze the asshole of something out there?
Matt: "Oh, completely!"
Travis: No!
Matt: "They hold it down and just squeeze its abdomen and the whole sandkheg spews out into this little glass barrel and then you pay for it. Top dollar."
Travis: Yeah, it's 300 something gold!
Matt: "Oh, did you buy some?"
Travis: No.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: You brain is filled with image of whatever creature your imagination has come up with being held down.
Travis: It's a giant, hairy water yak.
Matt: And it is squeezing some sort of yellowish liquid from its abdomen into a glass wine bottle, and you're now looking over at Percy and Keyleth who had just had sips of this earlier. It's not sitting well with your stomach.
Travis: We were gifted a bottle, and a couple of my friends had partook.
Matt: (cackles)
Travis: They say the stuff we had is A-plus.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Vax now appears at the edge of the table.
Laura: Oh, hi!
Liam: Hey. Took a little walk.
Laura: Let's go to the rooms. Let's check it out. How about that?
Liam: Sure.
Laura: Thank you for the rooms. Breakfast? Is there breakfast here?
Matt: (scoffs) "No, you find your own food."
Laura: Awesome.
Marisha: Does he still have some drink in front of him?
Matt: It hasn't been filled since, no.
Marisha: Oh, never mind.
Matt: Do you guys head to your rooms? Okay. You make your way up to the rooms. They're all clean, serviceable, nothing too fancy, but functional rooms. Each with two beds.
Taliesin: I want to check for anything unusual, if there's anything iffy about the rooms.
Matt: Investigation check.
Laura: Oh, I would follow suit.
Matt: Investigation check.
Taliesin: Oh, for the love of fucking--
Matt: Natural one?
Taliesin: No. Nine.
Matt: Nine. Nothing seems to be out of place or out of the ordinary.
Taliesin: Obviously.
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13? Seems to be a room.
Sam: I'm just going to check under the beds, that's it.
Matt: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Sam: 29!
Matt: 29. You find dust, dead insects, a dried-out rodent husk, and that's it.
Liam: Grog, you want to bunk up?
Travis: Yeah, sure. Are we going two to a room?
Liam: Yeah, there's six of us.
Matt: It's also about 3 00 in the afternoon.
Liam: I know that. I'm not going to go lie down on the floor. I just thought I'd call dibs.
Travis: Yeah. Cool.
Laura: Scanlan, then. Me and you?
Sam: Sure!
Laura: No. I'm kidding. I don't want to be in the same room with you at all.
Sam: Oh, I need a bucket and a mop.
Laura: No. You're with him.
Marisha: I'm with Vex.
Taliesin: Yes. What?
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Have fun!
Taliesin: With-- not-- no!
Liam: That's later.
Laura: What did you see?
Liam: Yeah, so we've got a backup plan because I followed whoever that person was back to where they dropped off. We should probably honor the offer first. If that goes sideways, then we have a backup plan.
Taliesin: It's so rare that we're actually given an opportunity to be honest about everything. We might as well try it once, see if we like it.
Sam: But do you know where this person receives her messages?
Liam: Absolutely.
Taliesin: Good.
Travis: Where is it?
Liam: Well, I don't know the names of the streets. I remember what it looked like. If you want to follow me, it's about a mile off. It looked like a furniture store. A Kingly Rest.
Laura: And you didn't even have to say jenga!
Liam: Wonders never cease.
Travis: A Kingly Rest. All right.
Matt: What are you guys doing?
Liam: Well, the casino's tonight. The deal's off. We can't get Grog in a fight.
Laura: Do you have a red shirt, Scanlan? Do we need to get you one?
Sam: Do we own anything red? Grog?
Travis: What?
Sam: Do we have anything red?
Travis: We have three fancy robes left.
Matt: You do not own a red shirt, but you could probably find one. Not too difficult.
Sam: All right. I'll find one. Take 20 minutes.
Matt: It doesn't take you too long. Costs you two silver pieces. You find a nice red shirt, billowing sleeves. It's totally up your alley.
Sam: Okay, great!
Travis: Can we go back out to the bazaar? Are far from there, or are we still close?
Matt: He's gone through the bazaar. You're not too far from it. Maybe a ten-minute walk.
Travis: They sell any weapons?
Laura: And potions. We need potions.
Taliesin: Trinkets.
Travis: Can I look and see if people are selling weapons?
Matt: You walk around. and there are weapons being sold.
Travis: Are there any exotic weapons?
Matt: No. Most weapons you find here are ornamental; they're for decoration. They're for putting above mantelpieces. There are various blades that have bolting mechanisms in the back where you can easily mount them to a wall. None of them, that you can see, at least, that are open in this bazaar for sale, are presented as an actual item for warfare.
Travis: Okay.
Taliesin: Is there a magic shop?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Marisha: Come on, Percy. Roll something good. That's better!
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19. Asking about, you do come to, within the bazaar, a small wooden building that's like a hut, but it's constructed of dark wood panels. It resembles those strange marionette performance boxes.
Taliesin: Punch and Judy box, yeah.
Matt: Except it just has this one frazzled-looking young woman standing there with long strands of curly dark brown hair. Red lips, dark eyeshadow. She's eagerly looking out with a sign in the front that reads, "Oddities and Eccentricities."
Taliesin: Good day.
Marisha: Be pleased.
Matt: "Good day."
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Matt: "Be pleased to you as well."
Taliesin: I'm stocked up on eccentricities, but if you have any oddities for sale, I'd be very interested.
Matt: "There are many oddities at my disposal. I'm Nisaba."
Taliesin: Percival. Hello.
Matt: "What kind of oddities are you looking for?"
Taliesin: Honestly, this is my first time in the city, and I'm trying to get a sense of what's available for sale and what sorts of things one would find in the city, so really, I'm interested in touring your stock, especially if you have anything exotic.
Matt: "Well, let me show you." Over the next five minutes, she brings out all sorts of strange knickknacks. It's essentially a display from the most awkward of vintage Salvation Armies you've ever come across.
Taliesin: God, we've found a hipster.
Matt: However, you do catch a quick flash of what appears to be some small crystalline vials that appear to be strapped to some sort of leather bandolier.
Taliesin: Well, that's interesting. What do you call that?
Matt: "This is for, well, a gentleman who passed through many years ago, who claimed to be a great alchemist, sold this off when he had come into a lot of debt within the city, so I made a good price. No one has really showed much interest in it."
Taliesin: Interesting. May I? May I take a look at it?
Matt: "You may."
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: The leather's finely made, if a little worn. The chemicals inside-- one of them does have a familiar color, a deep herbal red. This looks to be some sort of a low to medium level healing potion, most likely, from your experience in the use of that. The two others are grayish and murky and don't really draw your attention or anything you're familiar with.
Taliesin: Interesting.
Marisha: Percy, what's that?
Taliesin: I don't know. It's quite nice, though, isn't it?
Marisha: Well. Can I do a check on the other two potions to see with my potion knowledge? My potion sense?
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Not bad. Just straight intelligence? 15.
Matt: 15. They do appear to have been prepared in the way that you prepare magically enchanted vials for potions themselves, but you're not really able to make out just at a glance. You'd have to spend quite a time to make out what their nature is.
Marisha: I'd have to look at it. Not familiar, sorry. That looks like a health potion, though.
Taliesin: Yeah. It does look a bit--
Marisha: Healthy.
Sam: It's like Storage Wars. Just buy it. Who knows what's in there?
Taliesin: What were you hoping to unload for it?
Matt: "Well, knowing that is now a magic potion of healing and two other magical potions, that is a very valuable belt with its contents. I would sell you just the belt for five silver pieces. To include the vials, and they do come as a set, unfortunately, that would run you 275 gold pieces."
Taliesin: Now, see, we don't know what kind of healing potion that is, and those other two vials could have-- there is an expiration date on those things. And how long have you had it?
Matt: "We've had it for a number of years."
Taliesin: A number of years? Well, in that case, they've probably gone stale by now. I would say 75 gold at the very best.
Matt: (chuckles) "That is not going to work." She reaches out and takes the belt away from you and sets it back down on the inside.
Taliesin: 75 gold will not do you for that, then?
Matt: "For the belt, maybe."
Taliesin: For the belt, obviously. We've already established that that's in the silver range and certainly not touching the gold.
Matt: "Right, but you're willing to have and to offer that 75 gold for it, please."
Taliesin: 75 gold for the entire set.
Matt: "No, it's not going to work. I'm sorry."
Taliesin: No, and of course that makes sense that a hundred gold for that entire set would be very fair.
Liam: I'm starting to take a nap against a column standing up.
Sam: Just buy it.
Taliesin: 100 gold. You've had it for so long.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: This is going to go terribly. Where's my persuasion? Ooh, that's almost a number. Oh, good. 16?
Matt: She goes, "225 gold for the set."
Taliesin: 200. And an acknowledgement and compliment to your stunning hair. I'm attempting to flirt very poorly.
Travis: (laughing) That eyebrow.
Matt: Make a charisma check.
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: Just a straight charisma modifier to your roll.
Liam: Come on, snitch.
Taliesin: Come on. 12.
Laura: You flirted with grass better!
Matt: She goes, "I appreciate your patronage, but I am a patient woman, and that is how I hold business." (laughter)
Travis: Stonewalled!
Taliesin: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yes?
Taliesin: I feel like I should have learned some sort of lesson here. I'm just not entirely sure what it was.
Marisha: Oh, you know--
Taliesin: Hardly matters, I suppose.
Marisha: Maybe you'll come to it at the end of being in Ank'Harel.
Travis: Hey, guys. I had a thought. You know we were all supposed to have a meeting with the king? And I haven't been paying attention if anyone's watching, and we got time to kill. Should we go have a talk with the big man?
Laura: Or at least put in for an audience.
Travis: Yeah. Who knows if they'll even get to us today?
Taliesin: I'm sobering up a bit. Which we should probably do that.
Laura: Does it seem like a long walk towards the Cerulean Palace?
Matt: Maybe a 45-minute to an hour walk.
Liam: We've got hours and hours before we have to do anything.
Taliesin: We do. It's 4 00 in the afternoon.
Laura: What time's the sun set here? Can I ask somebody?
Matt: You ask around. It looks to probably be about four hours from sunset.
Taliesin: Perfect.
Sam: All right. Fine. Let's go.
Marisha: Plus, the best way to see a new city is to walk, you guys!
Taliesin: Wait, hold on. I have to open my Pokémon.
Matt: So you guys are making your way towards the Cerulean Palace. As you approach the large, extremely imposing palace, you come upon what looks to be an endless series of stairs that brings you to the upper platform that is the central portion of the city where the palace seems to reside, eventually peaking in the Sandherald district that you were referred to earlier as the location of the palace and where the Bowl of Judgment exists. You step up to the very top of the stairs to find yourself already breathless at the sight of the immense purple-blue-colored palace. A dozen towers reach for the clouds, the daylight peeking through their slightly translucent material, like glassy waters ever-frozen in a fall. The central tower, the one that caught your eye, that ends in a large cup-like position, rises above all of them with a slight spiral-type texture to the outside of the palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of the cityscape. As you get closer, you can see the main palace structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at their apex in its structure, smaller and smaller as it recesses further into the palace. Its very architectural build is a marvel, and seems to both have consistency and a chaotic feel to the placement of some of these arches too, in size. It's a very strange but fascinating structure. You can also see turquoise detailing and trim against many of the pillars and carvings and statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of this palace. As you approach what appear to be the front gates that ascend, with a very bright blue turquoise exterior, close to 50 Hands of Ord patrol various elements of the grounds around it. It looks like there are actual pockets of grass and gardens that exist around the Cerulean Palace in here. The topography changes almost to feel like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle of the desert. The guards do eye you suspiciously as you approach, and you watch as one armored woman, her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an ornate helmet of brass and blue, approaches you guys. "Welcome to the Cerulean Palace. I must ask your business here."
Laura: Forgive us for our intrusion. We come seeking an audience of J'mon Sa Ord.
Matt: "Our emperor does not take meetings. My apologies, but I must ask you to leave."
Taliesin: We are, in fact, a group of ambassadors from the continent of Emon, from the cities of--
Marisha: Continent of Tal'Dorei, city of Emon. It concerns the fate of the world.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Which one?
Taliesin: Not that one. That one. See? Listen to me. I'm not taking credit for that.
Marisha: 23. No, 24.
Matt: 24. "Let me inquire with the Grand Maven." She turns around, her armor clinking, and walks back to the palace, leaving you guys there amongst these courtyard grounds. A few moments pass before she returns, the doors opening. As she descends, next to her you see an older woman with these long, ceremonial robes that drag behind her, spilling across the stairs as she descends, seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle as she walks with each step. She wears a tall headdress with what looks like brass quills that press behind her head and down her back. As she approaches you all, the woman earlier that you spoke to, the Hand that approached you, stays behind quietly and watches, weapon at the ready. The woman steps forward with a smile, and unlike the abrasive appearance that most of the Hand have given, she seems to be more welcoming, and gives, for the first time since you've been here, a very formal welcoming bow with her hand before her, the other hand out. Says, "Be pleased, everyone."
All: Be pleased.
Matt: "I must apologize. We were not aware of your arrival here. I am the Grand Maven Gameshega. Please, enter and follow me."
Travis: She's the what?
Marisha: Gameshega?
Matt: Gameshega.
Laura: Gameshega.
Liam: Gameshega.
Marisha: Gameshega?
Matt: Gameshega.
Liam: Gameshega.
Taliesin: This is good. This is very good.
Matt: As she walks past you and the female Hand that saw you earlier steps aside and watches you as you pass, then ends up stepping behind you and flanking, keeping a watch from the back as you guys are led up the final staircase, through the front turquoise gates of the Cerulean Palace, and they close behind you with a resounding (impact), the impact echoing through these long halls. From the interior, massive pointed archways that lead down ornately decorated halls that echo with each footfall that hits across what looks like endless white and black bespeckled marble. She leads you through a series of hallways, more Hands walking past, as well as a number of other robed individuals. What appears to be a central chamber that has a number of steps and seats, where it looks like various philosophers are in mid-heated discussion in once again, this same language that you have not heard on your ears before. You are eventually brought to a very intricate and decorated waiting room, with some finely upholstered silk chairs, couches. The Grand Maven stops. "If you would not mind, please have a seat."
Taliesin: Of course.
Sam: Sure, yeah.
Matt: She walks into a nearby doorway. It looks like a single door that leads into a small-looking room, from the brief moment you have to see it. The door closes and you hear a (magic sound). Two minutes pass. Five minutes pass. Ten eerie, quiet minutes pass.
Travis: Windows in this room?
Matt: No windows in this particular room, but you notice as you take a close look, the roofs, while they are built of this deep blue, almost glass-like thick crystal, they're ever so slightly translucent, and it gives this general blue glow about the entire room. You can't make out any details from the outside, but there is this strange translucence to the entire structure.
Travis: Was that the only door to the room?
Matt: There is the hallway that you left behind, but there standing in the doorway is the same Hand that approached you guys and has been keeping an eye the entire time.
Laura: He's in the room with us?
Matt: Is away from you, standing in the large archway hall that led you into this waiting room.
Laura: I'm up and pacing the room, trying to pace near the door that she went through so I can keep an ear on the door.
Travis: I walk up to the guard, and I say, sorry. I really should have peed before I came in. Is there a privy I could use?
Matt: She glances at you. "You look like a strapping young man. Perhaps you can hold onto that for a time."
Travis: It looks that way, but I also have a strapping-sized bladder, and I've been known to leave strapping-sized messes in corners. You see, I don't really come from all this finery, so the side of the wall is just as good with me. It's just I'm trying to be polite.
Matt: She leans behind the hallway. (foreign language) "Just a moment." Another guard walks up behind and kicks a bucket into the room.
Travis: That'll do.
Liam: Put up or shut up.
Laura: Can I hear anything from the other side of the door?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'm laughing out loud.
Sam: One?
Matt: You have your ear up against the wall.
Laura: I didn't want to have my ear against the wall. I wanted to be subtly doing it.
Matt: Well, you're subtly doing it, and there's nothing. You get closer and closer, and there's nothing. The rest of you hear (magic sounds), but you're still-- Eventually, the door opens again, and there the Grand Maven stands again. She looks up to the rest of you. "Come with me. You have been granted an audience." She steps back into the chamber.
Laura: That happened much easier than I expected.
Travis: Thank you for the bucket. I'll hold it.
Laura: Are you sure, Grog?
Liam: We were convincing.
Sam: They must know who we are.
Taliesin: Trust our luck. Our luck is going. I'm walking into this.
Sam: Anyone says jenga, kill everyone we meet.
Liam: It's the only plan we have.
Taliesin: I'm walking into it.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You walk into what is a cylindrical chamber of smooth blue-purple quartz-like material with four strands of heavy chains taut between the ceiling and floor, about 15 feet above you. No other exit. You all enter and the door closes behind you, the Maven still relaxing, her arms to her side, her headdress still giving her this ominous presence. Looks up, and there's a (impact) shuddering sound. Suddenly, the bland, uncharacteristic walls, compared to the rest of the palace, begin to slide past the chains, now making this rattling sound as the floor itself seems to be lurching. You feel a bit of pressure in the room that wasn't there before. You're all being lifted, and the walls, now no longer walled in by the rest of the palace, you can now see this occasional traveling-down line as the spiral on the outside of the tower you once saw now surrounds you. The walls are much thinner than the rest of the palace, as you can see through this somewhat-translucent glass exterior the entirety of Emon surrounding you from upon high as it goes lower and lower as you're lifted higher and higher into this tower.
Laura: This is miraculous!
Matt: It's very off-putting, but beautiful at the same time. Everything's seen through this shimmering, somewhat-refracted blue passage. As you go higher and higher, you can see the countless homes, walls, and towers getting smaller and smaller, other towers eventually ending as you go higher in the tower. The Maven says, "I request you do not touch the walls, please."
Sam: Okay.
Travis: I really want to touch the walls.
Matt: The view reveals the entirety of the city around you, and beyond that, the distant dunes and the desert that seems to have no end. You view a far-off mountainscape a little bit in the northern direction that just begins to peek past your view, then (boom) the floor ceases again. You all seem to lurch for a moment, yourself, an inch before you catch yourself on your feet. The Maven catches herself, very used to this transition. You now see behind her, where it has stopped, there is another set of doors, similar to the ones you entered from in the bottom portion of this tower. The door opens, (creak) and you can see the next room is a set of staircases of the same color that slowly curl off and disappear upward above you. "Please, follow me." She walks in, her robe dragging behind her. You guys give enough berth for it to follow. As you're led up the stairway, choosing right or left, they both lead to the upper platform in what is the top of the central tower of the Cerulean Palace. As you enter this room, you see close to a hundred dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of multitudes of different colors; rainbowscapes of beautiful translucent cloths and silks, gently flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into each other around the outside of the wall. High arched windows on each side, and behind, what looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds surrounding this height and obfuscating certain portions as they meet with the height of this tower's apex. You see a large balcony from the opposite side of the room that is opened from its own similar-sized arch that extends outward. It has a railing about four feet up that is an opening that overlooks in open air all above the city to see. In the center of the chamber, you see a series of step-like platforms, circular, that rise up upon each other, and in the center, you see what seems to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that probably sits ten feet up from the base. Thin, but extremely long and widens towards the top. You can see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into this shiny, ruddy metallic material that frames the entirety of the throne. And there sitting atop this throne, you see a slender, human-like entity wearing no jewelry, no ceremonial adornments, no crown, just a simple brown cotton shirt over simple, elegant pants. Bare feet, no shoes. Androgynous and beautiful; you're unable to make out the sex of this creature. It's not a man, nor elf. Not fey, but something somewhat alien, almost. The skin a deep-set reddish brown, smooth and impeccable. The features are extremely fine and delicate. The eyes are what catch you: black like night, but the pupils, burning points of molten metal. The entity smiles and stands off the throne. Now, at this height, seeing it standing almost as tall as Grog, by comparison. The limbs are elongated. Extends a hand towards you as you step into the chamber. "Welcome to Ank'Harel, heroes of Tal'Dorei. I am J'mon Sa Ord, and it is my pleasure to greet you." And that is where we'll pick up our session in two weeks.
Laura: Oh shit, two weeks.
Matt: Two weeks.
Marisha: Two weeks.
Sam: Wow, guys. We did a lot of strange things.
Marisha: Yes, that was a weird day.
Travis: It's the pharaoh king from Stargate.
Matt: Yeah. We have two weeks until we pick up from that point in the story. Next week, look forward once again to Liam running his awesome one-shot.
Liam: I've got a party planned for you!
Matt: It's going to be awesome. It's been fun. But anyway, guys, thank you so much. Hope you had a fun time. Much love to all of you in the community. You're awesome; thank you so much for your support. Thank you for supporting our wonderful charities. 826 has been awesome, and they keep showing up. We saw recently in Target ads, actually, which is fantastic, so thank you guys so much for keeping up with them. You can still give them money. You can still support 826LA, as well as any of the other charities we have listed in our Guide to Critmas on the website. Those are great ways to give and great ways to support all of these wonderful people out there doing wonderful things.
Travis: And thank you, Loot Crate.
Matt: And thank you, Loot Crate, for your support of this show and support of our community, giving them an awesome discount. However, most of us will now adjourn to finish signing the posters forever.
Laura: Some of us are done.
Taliesin: Some of us will be doing it until the end of time.
Matt: Finishing for a lot of us.
Taliesin: Are we finishing tonight?
Matt: Finishing this weekend, so they should be going out soon to you guys. Thank you for your patience. The first batch of posters are now out. This batch will go out soon.
Liam: The desert awaits, Matt.
Matt: The desert waits for us, and it is much needed. Much love to you all. Have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Tonight is going to be interesting based on where we left off last time, but before we get to all of that, let me get through tonight's announcements for you guys so we can get to the game proper. For those of you who are drinking: first shot, there you go. First and foremost, tonight's episode is brought to you by our good friends at Loot Crate!
All: Loot Crate!
Matt: Sam, did you want to take us away?
Sam: Guys! Loot Crate has a brand new theme for December, Revolution! They're always watching, they've designed a system to keep you down, they're meddlesome, it's time for a revolution! Here's the thing. Every week I do these sort of funny bits about Loot Crate. This week, it's going to be hard for me, because-- to get real with you guys for a second-- my son, this morning, at his preschool they found that his pre-school's bunny has deceased. (sympathetic noises)
Sam: And so they wanted me-- I talked to some of the kids. Some of the kids are actually-- they like the show? And they asked if I could bring the bunny in a Loot Crate to pay tribute.
Laura: I do not believe you. You're not--
Sam: So it's here. Because this makes the bunny sort of part of the show. And the kids and the parents helped a little, they wrote a little something to commemorate the bunny and I'm going to read that for the kids. For the kids! What can be said about Dennis the Hopper? The bestest bunny the Little Explorer's classroom ever had, the way he always jumped left paw first, or nibbled on Olivia's Yo Gabba Gabba backpack? The way he pooped whenever Maddie picked him up. We'll miss your floppy ears, your soft fur, but most of all, your inner beauty. Love, the Little Explorers: Maddie, Olivia, Salinger, Paris, Justice, Woodley, Appalonia, DeGrass, Garvey, Barack, Sashimi, Neptune, Sevigny, Coachella, Aaliyah, Walnut, and Kevin.
Marisha: To be fair, that sounds like a southern California school. Silverlake!
Sam: And now to honor their request to make the bunny part of Critical Role forever, I'm going to--
Travis: Don't touch it, man!
Sam: We'll miss you, Dennis.
Travis: How long has that chicken been sitting in that box?
Sam: Little long. (laughter)
Liam: Hi to PETA, by the way.
Travis: Fucking hell. We have these amazing Loot Crate DX boxes!
Matt: Go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code CriticalRole, one word, you get 10% off your first month of Loot Crate. Sam couldn't say that because his mouth is full of bunny. But let's go ahead and open.
Marisha: The DX boxes aren't the clothes boxes, are they?
Laura: No, no no. That's Loot Crate Clothes. But wait!
Matt: That's actually really cool.
Laura: Is there Gears of War stuff in here? I thought there might be.
Matt: All about the Harry Potter blanket.
Laura: Shut up!
Travis: I'm a Baratheon, man, this means a lot to me!
Matt: Look at this blanket, guys  Wanded, and Extremely Dangerous.
Marisha: It's going to take me the whole unboxing to get it open.
Travis: Holy shit!
Taliesin: There's a Witcher Wild Hunt medallion paperweight.
Matt: I need more of these medallions, by the way.
Liam: Is that an Eye of Acomodo for my shirt?!
Laura: What's the Harry Potter thing?
Travis: It's a Hogwarts book clip.
Matt: You're slowly becoming more and more your character.
Liam: Yeah, he talks just like this!
Taliesin: This is not kidding around, this is kind of intense!
Sam: Does that go on your car, what is that?
Taliesin: It's a paperweight. You could brain somebody with this.
Matt: This will be a murder weapon in some case over the next year.
Travis: This is so legit!
Taliesin: That's a bottle opener right there.
Travis: Since 1963, drawing what acid does to your brain.
Laura: Thanks, Loot Crate!
Marisha: This is my further transformation to actually becoming Melisandre in School of Thrones.
Sam: Did we show this yet?
Marisha: Yeah, if anyone doesn't know, Matt produced, and I helped him in it, we were in this web series called School of Thrones, like four years ago. You make a cameo in it.
Taliesin: Yeah, I have a cameo in it.
Matt: It's ridiculous.
Marisha: It's basically Game of Thrones in a John Hughes film. Just watch it.
Matt: Watch it!
Laura: I really like this.
Taliesin: I'm stealing some of this stuff.
Travis: I'm a Slytherin prefect, you need to go to bed, Mr. Mercer. I apparently have an accent for some reason.
Sam: Guys, I'm going to keep the box in case the preschool's parrot dies.
Travis: Yeah, you going to start a pet cemetery?
Matt: Awesome. Thank you, Loot Crate. As a heads up, guys, next week on December 6th from 6:00 to 7:00pm, they're doing a Puzzle Quest special stream here on Geek & Sundry, and a number of us are going to be there with Ivan. Big thank you to Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest for putting this together. You guys probably remember back in September a few of us showed up for Game the Game Goes Critical, and thanks to you guys supporting that show, they've come back to have us go ahead and do this again. So we'll be here next Tuesday from 6:00 to 7:00, leading right up into Talks Machina, messing around. You can check out their game, Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest, on iOS and Android devices, and we'll see you guys hopefully next Tuesday. (air horn)
Sam: Whoa!
Travis: Wow. That's so appropriate.
Liam: That's my butt!
Matt: I approve now. If that happens during the game at any given point in time, that's disadvantage. (air horn)
Matt: Unless it's really funny.
Liam: Sound the horns.
Matt: Choose carefully, Liam. Choose carefully. It's like telling a kid he can choose his own punishment, it's dangerous. Also, we're helping support the amazing charity, Worldbuilders, with Patrick Rothfuss and a number of other great authors. You can find out more at worldbuilders.org. They bring the power of readers and writers and all that type of creativity together, to raise money to help make the world a better place. Go check it out, it's a wonderful group and we'll hopefully be doing more things with them coming up in the near future. Those announcements will come as we go forward, but Patrick Rothfuss, who's a friend of the show, was a guest on Critical Role--
Liam: I'm not really very familiar with Patrick Rothfuss--
Matt: You should read some of his stuff, it's pretty good, he's a good writer. And apparently is now making a show with Lin-Manuel.
Marisha: I hear they're besties. He's actually my new bestie.
Matt: That's right, yeah, you got a cool ring.
Marisha: Yeah, he gave me a ring, yeah. My new best friend.
Sam: He put a ring on it?!
Taliesin: It is the six degrees of Lin-Manuel now, isn't it? Kevin Bacon has been unthroned.
Matt: We're all slowly making our way towards getting him on the show. That's the goal.
Taliesin: Lin-Manuel, on the show.
Liam: I'm willing to wait for it.
Marisha: Lin-Manuel, on this show. This one.
Matt: Next up, this next Monday, actually, we are doing the final wrap-up episode of Force Grey: Giant Hunters live at the Egyptian Theater here in Hollywood from 5:00-8:30pm next Monday. We'll also be streaming it. The tickets are free, by the way, so if you're in the vicinity, go ahead and get some tickets, come join us. We have a great cast, a couple of new members are joining in for this. It's going to be a lot of fun and a great finale for the Force Grey series. Those who watched the Acquisitions Inc series and their PAX game, there might be a few fun little nods in there as well. So, anyway, much love to you guys if you can make it, if not we'll see you on Twitch on Monday regardless! And last but not least, here on Geek & Sundry there is coming up the Dick and Johnson Ultimate Christmas Special, with lots of familiar faces. Zach Carr is DMing this, it's a kick ass and chew bubblegum game, I'm sure you've seen it probably on Game the Game before, it's a great game. It's been on a few other projects here. But Hector and Keller, they're going to be playing through your favorite BFF duo to save everything in the world. There might be some cameos, a bunch of rapid-fire cameos throughout the show, so check out the Dick and Johnson Save Christmas special at December 12, at 4:00pm Pacific here on Twitch. It's going to be fun.
Travis: That is the best name.
Matt: Might be showing up off screen, just to heckle people. Or more. We'll find out. All right, any other announcements?
Liam: Yeah, she's trying to keep it on the down low, but Laura doesn't have any of her dice, really. She has three sets instead of the usual ten.
Laura: I brought my bag of dice home for the holiday and then I didn't bring it--
Sam: Why did you bring it home?
Laura: I maybe was going to give some of our dice to our winners for the costume contest.
Sam: But instead--
Laura: I just left them at home.
Sam: I have a bag of dice in there that I've never used.
Laura: I have a lot of dice, I just don't have all my dice, you guys. I still have a bunch up here.
Travis: She literally has 300 over here.
Laura: I do, I have a lot. But thank you!
Taliesin: We're doomed.
Marisha: Speaking of charities, before we go on. Speaking of charities, I would still like to give a shout-out to 826LA, who we so love and support. They're great. People will send us tweets being like, "Hey, do you guys still support 826LA?" Always, I don't think you can stop supporting 826LA.
Taliesin: I don't know, they know what they did.
Marisha: I don't know, they know what they did.
Taliesin: And they have their own shop also, and if you're interested you can go and shop at 826, and they have super cool posters and books. And buttons, and all sorts of stuff that you can get that they put out that are super super cool.
Marisha: And I've seen people take you up on your suggestion that it's always a great date place.
Taliesin: It is such a good date place.
Marisha: We've had people tweet at us and be like, we took you up on that, and it is a good date place, because they have cute store fronts, so you should go.
Taliesin: Yeah. The actual quality of the date is not guaranteed, but the quality of the venue--
Marisha: No. That depends on you.
Taliesin: No. That depends on you.
Marisha: And we can't help that.
Sam: Could you do a wedding there if you wanted to?
Taliesin: A very small one.
Sam: Or a bar mitzvah, or maybe a bris?
Taliesin: A very small wedding, or a wedding with small people.
Sam: All right.
Matt: All righty then. On that note, unless anyone else has anything to say we are going to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. Including my party. Who need to calm the fuck down. (laughter)
Liam: Party!
Matt: So, picking up where we left off last time. The group of intrepid adventurers known as Vox Machina have been making their way through their quest to take down the Chroma Conclave, a group of chromatic dragons who have been terrorizing the countryside in Tal'Dorei under the rule of Thordak the Cinder King, a great, powerful, and seemingly elementally charged ancient red dragon who sits in the center of the city of Emon. After gathering the rest of the artifacts you guys have been seeking, called the Vestiges of Divergence, the last one being found in the City of Brass upon the Fire Elemental Plane, you traveled back to Fort Daxio, a northern fort north of Emon, where you were planning a trap of some kind for Thordak. Upon arriving with two charges of yours, two previously enslaved celestial-blooded boys that you found in the City of Brass, you all traveled across the planes, with the help of Keyleth, back to Fort Daxio to find the landscape scarred with recent flame and apparently a battle raging at the outer gate. That is where we left off. So, you guys, looking northward, you can see the large plumes of black smoke billowing up from the direction of the fort. The outer wall seems to have sustained some damage. You can see a number of flying entities swooping in. Dozens of them, while you can hear the distant sound of combat, shouts and battle. You guys, as you land and realize this, you can see the two slaves, who have now been freed and taken with you, both look immediately wide eyed and freaked out and closed off. What are you guys doing?
Travis: This is fine.
Marisha: So much safer here, kids.
Laura: We need to get them safe.
Sam: Who safe? The place is on fire. They're not safe.
Laura: I take off on my broom and fly up in the air.
Sam: Ah! Wait! You forgot your hat!
Laura: I want to see up and over the wall and see what's going on on the inside.
Matt: Okay. So you fly up and head up over the front wall.
Laura: I don't want to go in, I just want to look.
Matt: Right. So you fly up and get a vantage point to see what's going on over the wall.
Laura: Yes.
Travis: You're going to get seen.
Matt: As you crest up in the air, you notice that there are a number of soldiers currently battling possibly a hundred or more lizard men that have swarmed into the fort, as well as a number of-- and go ahead and make a perception check actually to see if you can make some good detailed elements out.
Travis: First roll of the night.
Laura: First roll, first roll, first roll. Here we go. 27.
Matt: 27. All right. These are wyvern riders. This is a group of wyvern riders, with lizard men, that have swooped in. You can see a number of the siege elements that have been built by Percy over there, some have been firing off on the inside or at least ones that were installed in the actual fort base. You also see a distant explosion, a flash of light on one of the walls on the inside. There is the outer wall, and there is a courtyard in the actual fortress itself. The front gates to the inner courtyard have already been breached, and most of the battle is happening inside the main courtyard.
Travis: Are we outside the courtyard or inside?
Matt: As you're noticing this, you watch as two wyverns are now swooping in your direction from the outside of the outer wall.
Sam: Because they saw you.
Marisha: So we're on the outside of the wall?
Matt: You guys are far south, probably a good quarter-mile south of the fort, on the outside of the wall.
Taliesin: I say we starting making our way and deal with this.
Laura: Yeah. I draw-- are they close enough to shoot them?
Matt: You can wait until they're close enough. They're a little bit out of your range right now.
Taliesin: Is it possible they're out of Bad News' range or is that even humanly possible?
Matt: You know what, as of right now, you could probably hit one of them with Bad News.
Taliesin: All right. I double check. Speak now or forever hold your peace, I'm doing this.
Matt: What's the long range on it?
Taliesin: 1,200.
Matt: Okay. You bear down and you--
Taliesin: 1,200 feet. 1,200 feet.
Matt: Yeah. Go for it. And Laura, you still have to wait at this point. You're readying your shot.
Laura: Yeah. But I Hunter's Mark one of them.
Matt: Okay. Aiming for--
Laura: Oh wait, it's probably a ranged thing too.
Matt: It's okay. You're currently selecting a wyvern or the rider to fire at?
Laura: The rider.
Taliesin: All right. Taking a shot. Oh, that'll do! 30.
Matt: The explosion from the front of the muzzle of Bad News fires off, the spark and flame and smoke billowing forth. The shot has no impact. It looks like, from gauging at this distance, it was just outside of the range.
Laura: Oh, they're 1,200 feet away, they're that far?
Matt: It's hard to gauge really, at that distance, whether or not they were there, but apparently the bullet lost momentum by the time it reached their position.
Taliesin: Okay. Reload.
Marisha: Let's move in.
Laura: Can I shout down and yell, get the boys safe! But I don't know who I'm shouting it to, just one of you guys--
Travis: More impassioned.
Laura: (yelling) Get the boys safe!
Sam: Oh my god. We have to get these boys to safety.
Travis: Do we?
Marisha: Why don't we have them run? Have them run. Yeah. I grab them and I say, run that way. Don't die. They're good.
Laura: Seriously?
Taliesin: Actually, I've got a better idea.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: Hand them one of the stones.
Marisha: All right, yeah, sure. I hand them a gatestone.
Taliesin: We'll find you when it's safe. Hide wherever you need to. Stay away from the castle. We will find you when it's safe.
Marisha: Hide in the bushes, don't go far.
Sam: Or go anywhere.
Matt: They nod and they take the stone, and they start running off towards the western edge of this valley, which has the two cliffsides that come into the valley here. A lot of the nearby brush appears to have been burned on the way.
Marisha: Oh, fuck. I say, try and stay unseen!
Matt: They go darting off, keeping low, and you get the sense that they're used to fleeing, so they dart off, arm in arm, rushing off towards the side of the valley wall.
Sam: So they're gone forever.
Matt: You have time to reload before they get close enough for her to fire, so if you want to take another shot.
Taliesin: Sure. I'll take another shot.
Laura: Should I hang out and wait or should we--
Taliesin: Actually, let's head as a group towards this. I say we run and we take everything that's heading towards us. I'll wait until they're close enough that I can get a good--
Marisha: We all charge for the gate.
Matt: Okay, so you guys are all charging towards the outer gate. What are you doing, Vex? You watch the rest of your party darting--
Marisha: I Message to Vex, and I say, what do you see? How many wyverns are there? Do you see any dragons?
Laura: Do I see any dragons?
Matt: Currently you do not see any dragons at the--
Laura: I don't see any dragons, but it looks like about a hundred enemies.
Sam: Hundred! Is that true? I missed that one.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: That's a lot.
Sam: (laughing) That's more than two.
Travis: Is it?
Liam: What do you sense? Do you sense dragons?
Laura: Well, that's going to take a minute.
Liam: I'd work on that.
Sam: All right, let's just charge in blindly! There's no cover out here, right?
Matt: There is no cover.
Sam: Let's take out those fucking riders.
Marisha: We have an Avengers moment. We're running. Like Guardians of the Galaxy!
Travis: That's like Chariots of Fire. You're doing the wrong music.
Marisha: Okay, you know what, any movie where they run in slow motion toward something, which happens a lot.
Matt: There you go. As you guys are charging towards the blown-open gates to the outer courtyard of Fort Daxio, with Vex swooping down on her broom with the bow out, you watch as these wyvern riders come swooping down in your direction. Their claws extended, their tails and stingers out forward, they come swooping down. Go ahead and take a shot. You can take a shot as well.
Taliesin: I'm taking my first shot. I'm also making it a wing shot.
Laura: So I Hunter's Marked them as soon as they were close enough.
Matt: Yes. Hunter's Mark. There's two, and a third one has joined, a little behind now. They're coming upon you. Which one do you Hunter's Mark?
Laura: The one that's biggest?
Matt: Hard to gauge at this distance.
Laura: The one that's closest.
Matt: Okay, there you go.
Taliesin: Wing shot, first one.
Laura: And I am a third level rogue now.
Taliesin: 30.
Laura: So I get advantage on my attack, if they haven't attacked me yet, right? If they haven't taken a turn?
Matt: I believe, looking at the specifics there--
Laura: As an assassin? At your third level, you get advantage if you get the drop, if they haven't taken a turn yet.
Matt: Technically--
Laura: They're moving?
Matt: They know you're around. This is less like they haven't acted yet. They've been acting. Every round, they've been dashing toward you. So you do not have the drop on them, as they've been making a beeline since the beginning. Apologies.
Laura: Well, all right. I guess I'll just have a 32 attack, then.
Matt: Okay, I want you and Percy to both roll damage on those attacks, as these are both guided at the same individual.
Taliesin: Okay.
Laura: 21, and then-- That is awesome.
Taliesin: 26 points of damage, and he has to make a strength save against becoming prone.
Laura: Do I get sneak attack on this?
Matt: No, you would not, unfortunately.
Laura: Okay, so it's just 21 damage, with four of lightning.
Matt: Okay! So, as you hear the explosion at the front of the muzzle of Bad News take off, the arrow whizzing through the air, both impacting into each side of the wyvern, you watch as one of its wings tears open. It tumbles forward, the rider thrown off its back and clutching onto its reins, flipping over the side as it corkscrews and slams into the ground about 150, 200 feet behind you, skidding across the dirt.
Laura: Oh, I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage!
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: An additional three.
Matt: Okay. Effectively slammed and left behind in the dust right now, it's going to have to get up and rush to try and catch up to you guys. The other two are swooping down now and have managed to get up--
Laura: Do I get my second attack?
Matt: You do get your second attack, yes. You could as well, for your round.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Hits.
Taliesin: Same thing, with a drop.
Sam: Can I extend my arm, with my Wand of Fireballs ready to shoot?
Matt: Yeah, actually.
Laura: 18 damage.
Sam: How far are they?
Matt: At this point, they're maybe 150 feet from you.
Taliesin: I don't crit on a 19 yet, do I?
Matt: No.
Marisha: Do you ever get that?
Matt: At a higher level.
Laura: Trinket crits on a 19.
Matt: Trinket's cool like that.
Marisha: Why can't you be Trinket? We love the bear more than you, Percy.
Taliesin: Oh, I know. 32 to hit.
Matt: And the save? What's the DC, again?
Taliesin: I believe it's--
Matt: You have to write down your DC, man.
Taliesin: I used to. Oh, 19. It's there, I just couldn't see.
Matt: There you go. This one now, as you guys both-- you pull back and release your second arrow, and you take Bad News, reload it, and then fire again-- you watch as this time, one of the wings breaks at the hinge. It folds under itself. The rider, this time, as opposed to holding on, is thrown and plummets the rest of the distance, hitting the ground with a very heavy (splat) against the stonework, his head scattering. The wyvern ends up slamming into the ground and skidding off into a big cloud of dust behind you as well, as you guys continue pushing forward. However, that does complete your round. The last one does swoop down and is going to-- You're making the loudest noise and got the most attention, so it's going to swoop in your direction, Percival. It's going to come on down, it's going to make two attacks on you, and then harry and lift up. That's with its bite. That's going to be a miss. It goes to snatch at you with its bite, and you duck out of the way. However, the stinger comes up from behind. That is a 19 to hit.
Taliesin: That just barely hits.
Matt: Just barely hits? Okay. As the stinger slams into your shoulder, that is ten points of piercing damage. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: One of those again, okay. Ten points of damage and a constitution saving throw.
Travis: (singing) Roll high, you blue-haired motherfucker.
Sam: It's, like, blue and purple.
Taliesin: I'm going to do a Resolve.
Matt: Okay, to take that saving throw again? Go for it.
Taliesin: That's even worse. Do I have to take the worse one for the Resolve?
Matt: It's whatever you rolled the second time, I think.
Taliesin: Can I burn another Resolve, just to fuck it, because this is annoying me?
Liam: If it's like Luck, it's a no.
Matt: Let me double check, just a moment.
Laura: Does it petrify you?
Taliesin: I'll find out!
Matt: All right, so. This is your Indomitable? Not Resolve, your Indomitable. You must use the new roll.
Taliesin: Okay, that's a 12.
Matt: A 12? No. All right, so, as the poison courses through your body, the stinger itself pulling forth, you see a bit of black-greenish liquid spill out as it pulls itself out of the wound. You suffer 24 points of poison damage as it then lifts back up out of range and is going to circle around. You guys all still running? You see Percy get hit.
Sam: Can I take my Fireball shot?
Matt: You can now. Because it was coming very close before you had the opportunity to hit, it swings up past and you can now, reaching behind, get a Fireball wand shot if you want.
Sam: I will take my Fireball wand shot.
Liam: How high in the air is it?
Matt: At this point now, as it swooped past, it's about 40, 45 feet away? A safe enough distance for the Fireball to not blow up his own party.
Sam: It's got a DC of 15, that wand.
Matt: That is a no. It rolled a three. So go ahead and roll damage.
Sam: Can I fire more than one charge, or should I have said that already?
Matt: You should have said that at the beginning. It's a basic.
Sam: Never mind. So, it's 8d6, right?
Matt: 8d6, you got it. And what are you doing, Vax?
Liam: If I can attack, I'm throwing daggers.
Matt: Yeah, you can do that, as it sweeps past after getting the rapid stinger into the chest.
Liam: First gets 26, second is a 19.
Matt: Okay, both hit.
Liam: Okay, dagger, dagger, dagger.
Sam: 33.
Liam: 14 for the first, and the second is eight. That's it. It's within 40 feet, you said?
Matt: Yeah, as it swoops past.
Liam: I am going to Channel Divinity and use a Vow of-- oh, I can't. Can I ditch the second attack?
Matt: Nah, you've already confirmed it.
Sam: Also, Matthew, I don't know if this affects anything. I am exhausted. Does that change anything?
Matt: Correct. You have one point of exhaustion, which means that your ability checks are at disadvantage. Keyleth, Grog, do you guys want to do anything while it passes overhead?
Marisha: You go first.
Travis: No, please, ladies first. No, I insist.
Marisha: Okay. I run to Percy and I grab and pick him up and keep running, and I say, let me know if you're poisoned.
Taliesin: Do I feel--?
Matt: It was a burning pain through your body, but it subsided after the original poison coursed through your body. So you fought it off sufficiently afterward.
Marisha: Okay, I help him up and I say, come on! And we keep running.
Matt: Okay, you guys keep running. Grog?
Travis: The one that Vax shot that hit the ground--
Laura: I'm Vex.
Travis: Yeah, whatever.
Matt: Yeah, that's 200 feet behind you.
Travis: Oh, it's 200 feet.
Matt: You guys have been running this whole time as it went overhead and crashed into the ground behind you.
Travis: Oh, I'm good.
Matt: Okay, you guys just keep running? Okay. So, as you guys continue to run forward, it swings around after the Fireball detonates, and you see it wobble in the air for a second. 33 points. The rider has turned to ash, blown off the top of it. The wyvern, however, has still found its target and turns around and on its own is swooping back towards the group of you guys. You're now about halfway towards the front gate of the keep, of Fort Daxio. You guys, both Percy and Vex, with ranged weapons, you can take your shot now as it's turning around and returning to you guys, still charging forward.
Laura: Hunter's Mark!
Matt: All right, so you move your Hunter's Mark over to that guy? Go for it.
Laura: 25.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: 23.
Matt: All right. 23 damage, nice. All righty.
Laura: On the first arrow.
Matt: Yes. Second one?
Laura: That is, what, 23? Yeah. 23.
Travis: 22.
Laura: 22.
Matt: Right, so there's five plus three for this, and it's plus eight damage-- Oh, to hit! Okay. Both hit. I was like, that's really high damage for arrows! My apologies.
Travis: Two ones in a row.
Laura: Shut up! Ugh! 13.
Matt: 13 damage?
Laura: Three ones in a row!
Travis: I guess you've got to throw those dice away! Only 900 left.
Matt: So running forward, you turn around behind, over your shoulder. You switch your actual direction of arrows you normally fire with and turn the other way. Both arrows sink into it and you see it wobble in the air. Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to take, on the fall-down, I put Bad News away and I pull Animus out because it's closer now. So I can take easier pot shots at it. 31.
Matt: Hits.
Taliesin: How many shots, can I take a full round of shots, or--?
Matt: You can if you want to.
Taliesin: I'll take a full round. 31. 26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Taliesin: And 33.
Matt: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Where are my d10s at? That's not a d10. There we go. That's three shots, it's 17--
Sam: So much math!
Taliesin: I'm making sure I do this right because-- 24 points, 34 points, 41 points of damage plus--
Matt: Not on one hit. That's all of his attacks.
Taliesin: Three, it's three, yeah. 41 points of damage plus ten points of psychic damage.
Matt: Nice.
Taliesin: That was three shots.
Matt: All righty, so all three shots pelt it in the chest. You can see giant sections of its meaty chest blown open and it's streaking dark wyvern blood behind it. However, it's still flying. The fervor on its face as it's near death is causing it to get more intense as it swoops down toward you. Streaking out, the tail ends up curling beneath. It's going to take a shot toward you, Percy, as you were the one that most recently hit it and did the most damage. With the bite, that is a 24 to hit.
Taliesin: Oh, that hits.
Matt: And the stinger is at only a 13 to hit.
Taliesin: That does not hit!
Matt: So, the stinger, seeing it coming this way, you duck out of the way. However, its giant wyvern jaws clamp down and streak across your shoulder as the momentum pulls it past, dragging it across the back. For that, you suffer ten points of piercing damage.
Marisha: That's not too bad.
Matt: As it comes down at that point, it's back in range for any of you melee folk that want to take a swing at it. Grog?
Travis: Can I rage, and can I take a swing at Falcor, please?
Matt: Yes, you can!
Travis: Okay! Lovely.
Liam: We have no initiative, so I don't know who's where. Am I close enough to go after Grog?
Matt: Yes. I'm keeping tabs because this is more of a flyby as you guys are running.
Travis: Could I make it a reckless attack, please?
Matt: Sure, yeah. A lot of these are happening simultaneously.
Travis: 25.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Nine, 22, plus two points of necrotic, 24.
Matt: Okay, as it swoops down and bites into Percy's arm as it drags up in the air, you watch as a very fast-running Grog, who's been ahead of the group at this point, his speed is higher than anybody, spins around, axe in the air, and carves right through the front of its chest to its back. It (screeching) and slides into two pieces that then scatter into the ground, smearing black darkness across the dry, desert floor. You guys continue to run forward. Currently, all your harrying wyverns are way too far behind and damaged or not paying attention, before you guys are just now reaching the outside of the busted Fort Daxio outer wall, where the front gates are collapsed inward and slightly burned.
Travis: Didn't seem like that big of a problem. That was not so tough.
Laura: There's a hundred more guys inside, Grog!
Travis: I know, you keep saying that number, like I know what it means, so let's get it on.
Marisha: Grog, Grog! 100 needs three hands to make.
Travis: How many hands?
Marisha: It needs--
Travis: How many?
Laura: Keep running!
Marisha: Okay. Keep running! Keep running!
Taliesin: It's not helpful.
Matt: You guys all go into the front gates?
Laura: I'm on the broom, so I'm up and over the wall.
Matt: Okay. You come up over the top of the wall. As you get up over the top, immediately you see they have two large ballistae. The number of ballistae installed throughout the walls here, two of them have already been torn apart and whoever was manning them is lying on the ground, torn open and dead. But you do also see other dead lizardmen. It looks like a fight has been going on for a short time here and has been a back and forth. As you guys come into the main courtyard, you find the ground is charred with small flames that are still burning on bushes, and elements of piles of broken wood and things that were part of the encampment that just caught fire. You can see groups of lizardmen battling various soldiers, some of them still screaming and the sound of lizard-like battle cries as they charge in, slamming weapon against weapon, shield against face. This is an actual small-scale war happening inside here. It's hard to tell which side is winning. A lot of the soldiers are better-trained, but occasionally you watch as a wyvern swoops down and picks up a soldier and throws them off the side, and slams into the ground, no longer moving.
Marisha: Do we see anyone we know?
Sam: Where's Elle?
Marisha: Do we see Allura?
Matt: Perception check.
Marisha: Come on, opal dice. That's not bad! 26.
Sam: Oh, disadvantage.
Matt: Disadvantage for you, buddy.
Sam: Oh, okay. 14.
Matt: Okay. So the two of you, as soon as you dart inside and glance over, you can see nobody that catches your familiar eye. Everyone who is in armor is in full armor. They're all in the actual Fort Daxio defense regalia and they are covered in blood, they're covered in soot and they are not paying attention to you because they are fighting for their lives right now. You can see there are a number of tents to the side, dried trees that have burnt out entirely. You can see a number of the trebuchets that you have repaired earlier that have already torn down, or at least have suffered partial damage from fire or other elements, bludgeoning.
Marisha: But there doesn't seem to be any tabards from Emon, or any tabards from Syngorn or anything like that?
Matt: No. It looks like when this began, currently only Daxio's army was here. And is here currently.
Marisha: I mean, that still sucks. But okay.
Matt: Yeah. You do watch and see as currently, there is no tension toward you because the battles happening right now are still happening. You see multiple soldiers gathering around wyverns that have been dragged to the ground with chain or have nets thrown over them, and soldiers are gashing, running up and slashing and stabbing as they can, while the lizardman carves its way through, and takes its spear and starts piercing out with its shield. As you look around, nothing but insanity going around. What are you guys doing?
Laura: Are there any clusters that look like not a lot of our soldiers around, just lizardmen? Or is it all mixed in together?
Matt: It's all mixed in right now. It's a free-for-all. There's no group of lizardmen sitting around and waiting out for a target.
Laura: Are there any wyverns in the sky that don't see us?
Matt: There are a number of wyverns scattered that are currently swooping down and being part of the chaos.
Marisha: About how many wyverns?
Matt: Currently not engaged on the ground? I'd say about seven.
Travis: Can I go full murderhobo status and find a group of people on the ground that need help?
Matt: Yeah, totally.
Laura: I want to try to get a sneak attack on one of the wyverns.
Marisha: I'm going to also go for the wyverns.
Taliesin: I'm going to activate my spider-climbing boots and going to reload and I'm going to start walking around and pot-shotting anything on the ground that's giving trouble. If I see somebody, I'm shooting until they stop.
Matt: Okay. There are masses of lizardmen in this area that are in the middle of the fray. As soon as you guys storm in and start making noise, making your presence know, a number of them who are waiting for a way to pierce in and get their weapons into the last of these soldiers that are fighting off, as best they can, the last stand they have here at the outside of Fort Daxio, some of them turn over their shoulders and see you and start rushing in. You guys, with ranged weapons, you go first. Go ahead and roll attacks on this.
Laura: I get advantage because the wyverns don't see me, right?
Matt: The wyverns have not seen you.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Actually, make a stealth check, just to make sure you've made your way in carefully. They're not paying attention to you, but they may or may not see you out of their peripheral.
Laura: 19.
Matt: Okay, yeah. The one you're aiming at has not seen you.
Laura: Okay. 33.
Matt: 33 hits.
Taliesin: I am going to cast on whatever the biggest one is, and I'm going to cast Hex, which I still have. And I'm taking my first shot. 28.
Matt: 28 hits.
Taliesin: Gun jam!
Travis: Damn it!
Laura: 31. 31 on the first hit.
Taliesin: I take five points of damage.
Matt: Okay. What was that, the first one?
Laura: 31.
Matt: 31, nice!
Laura: And the same, it's another 35 attack.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Before I went down, I do 15 points of damage plus four points of psychic damage before the gun jammed.
Laura: 25 on the second.
Matt: 25 damage? Great! So that one you're aiming at had already taken some damage in the battle. Its rider had already been torn off of it and it's basically on automatic tear-and-destroy mode. Both of your arrows-- one finds the side of its throat. As it whips its head around to look at the direction it came with, this one finds the eye at front of its snout, sinks in, and it slowly, limply falls out in the air and smashes into the ground, maybe 25 feet to your right.
Taliesin: It also would have taken six points of necrotic damage to it, so.
Matt: Okay, cool. You're aiming at the same one as her?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: You guys (impact). This poor wyvern gets torn asunder.
Travis: Poor, my ass!
Laura: Poor your ass!
Matt: (laughs) Poor Travis' ass!
Sam: Tall cup of Travis' ass.
Matt: You watch as a number of these lizardmen, six to be exact, all start rushing in towards you guys as they were firing at the wyvern in the air. What are you guys doing at this point? You just have a wave of them coming at you right now.
Liam: I'm following Grog to get his scraps.
Marisha: They're coming at us?
Matt: Yeah, you guys are still clustered together.
Marisha: Is it a group of-- how many?
Matt: Six. They're just charging straight at you. Some have swords, shields, and spears like (snarling).
Marisha: Before anything crazy happens, I'm going to go ahead and pull up the Spire of Conflux and I'm going to Fireball right where they are.
Matt: As they're charging in, you watch the staff slam into the ground. As it slams into the ground, you can see at the very tip, there's a small piece of crystalline energy that begins to go from a dull greenish-blue to a bright red. And as it hits the apex of its glow, a single beam of red energy streaks forward towards them as they're all charging. What's the DC on that?
Marisha: 19.
Sam: 19 on the Spire?!
Matt: Well, it's whatever her spell DC is when she cast it.
Sam: Damn!
Matt: And no, none of them make it! So go ahead and roll the damage on that.
Marisha: Wait, Fireball. I don't know this damage.
Sam: 8d6. Radius 20.
Marisha: Give me two. I get to reroll ones, too, because it's fire damage.
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: And I got three ones. So those will all get rerolled.
Sam: Is that true?
Marisha: That is true.
Matt: It's an ability of the Spire.
Taliesin: That's nuts.
Marisha: Ten, 15, 25 points.
Matt: 25 points of damage?
Sam: There's another six up there, the red one.
Marisha: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! 25, 30 points of damage.
Matt: 30 points of fire damage.
Marisha: Thanks, Sam! MATT; As you guys are getting your weapons ready, you have both your daggers out at the side. You have your axe at the batter-up position. You watch as suddenly they burst into red flame and a number of their charred, burning bodies tumble to the ground, motionless. As the fire subsides, all six have been destroyed by the blast from the Fireball.
Travis: That's what we were going to do, right? Yeah! That's basically what we had in mind.
Liam: This knife does the same fucking thing.
Travis: I thought so. I've see it happen. Really, I have. Impressive, Keyleth. Impressive. Yeah. Point it towards the enemies, okay?
Matt: As the chaos is still happening, you watch as another blast of flame explodes on the top tower that is the front of the fortress itself, and you hear what sounds like dual Wilhelm screams as two guys who were situated on the top, running to of the ballista, get blown off and both slam into the ground, faces and necks snapped from the impact on the floor. Looking up in that direction, you watch as another streak of bluish-green arcane energy shoots up a few hundred feet into the sky, and it (poof), as a sort of signal for them.
Marisha: No, no, no!
Matt: You look up top as you see one wyvern is curling its way, perched up on the edge of it. And there, jumping onto its back, you see an elf. An elf with longish, blonde hair. Robes that are bloodied. It gets up and holds onto the reins.
Sam: How far?
Matt: At this point? He's probably about 80 feet from you. You guys are halfway across the courtyard to the actual fortress.
Liam: He's up on the wall?
Sam: Can I shoot him with lightning?
Matt: If you want to get close.
Sam: I mean, that's a 100-foot range.
Matt: So, yes. You could.
Sam: He's a bad guy?
Laura: I don't know!
Marisha: He's on a wyvern, so I'm going to say maybe.
Laura: Can I shoot him with a Bramble Shot?
Matt: About 45 feet up.
Laura: I want to try to shoot him with a Bramble Shot.
Matt: Shoot him?
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: Okay!
Sam: He's on a bad wyvern, right? This is a bad guy.
Laura: I think so.
Matt: For the purposes of this, guys, we're going to go ahead and roll initiative.
Laura: He's a bad guy!
Matt: Well, you don't know if he's a bad guy or not! But he's on the battlefield.
Laura: That's why I'm Bramble Shotting him. Because I'm trying to tangle him up.
Matt: Pike has been having a hard time keeping up with everyone with her tiny, short legs.
Laura: Pike!
Marisha: Come on, Pike! Come on!
Taliesin: I'm rolling really poorly.
Travis: Yeah, me too.
Laura: Do you have your snitch?
Taliesin: Yeah. It's just rolling poorly.
Laura: Do you want one of mine?
Taliesin: No, no.
Travis: Take your clothes off, Taliesin, reset.
Sam: I'll take my clothes off. If it'll inspire us.
Laura: Oh, no. What is it? Do it, Sam!
Travis: Do it slowly. Do it. (yelling)
Travis: Holy fuck!
Liam: Triple disadvantage for the night!
Taliesin: We're dead, we're going to die.
Sam: It's on. (laughter)
Travis: For the rest of the game, you've got to look at that--
Liam: May the odds be ever in your favor. (laughter)
Matt: Forgot to mention the new GM Tips episode is out this week, talking about how to deal with Player Character deaths. (laughter)
Sam: Oh, man! If I died in this shirt, it would be the worst way. (laughter)
Matt: Oh my god! Sam! Sam!
Liam: We've never seen the picture at that size. And it makes me want to Goonies-style cut a hole in the mouth.
Matt: No one should ever say, "I want to cut a hole in the mouth of a picture of you." I do want to say that is pretty much life-size, which is really creepy.
Sam: I wish I could do what Travis can do with his pecs, but I-- (laughter)
Travis: You're there, you're there.
Matt: With you guys on the battlefield, let's roll initiative.
All: We did.
Travis: We have to do it again?
Taliesin: I'd love to do it again.
Matt: (sing-song) Sorry!
Marisha: That was funny.
Matt: You guys.
Sam: He's a bad guy, right? I mean, we can kill him, right?
Travis: Kill him anyway. And find out later.
Taliesin: We can also take out his ride.
Laura: Yeah, we can take out the wyvern.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Laura: 25.
Liam: 22.
Matt: Nice. 20 to 15?
Marisha: 15.
Matt: I need someone to roll for Pike, by the way.
Laura: Eight. I don't know what Pike's initiative is.
Matt: I think it's plus one, so add that-- Nine. All right. So 15 to ten?
Taliesin: 13. Oh, go ahead.
Sam: Oh, 11.
Taliesin: I don't have my sword working.
Matt: Grog, what did you get?
Travis: Eight.
Laura: Aww, you and Pike fighting together.
Matt: Top of the round, as you see this figure get onto the wyvern up top. Bloodied, grabbing on to the reins, looking over the top, Vex, you're up first.
Laura: I'm going to shoot a Bramble Shot at him.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 20?
Matt: 20. Hits.
Travis: This man, this man is an elf, right?
Laura: 16. And then the DC is 16.
Matt: 16 damage and DC of 16. Is it strength?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: No, that's a 15.
Laura: Oh! Then he's restrained!
Matt: Does he take additional damage from the Bramble Shot?
Laura: Yeah, he takes 16 damage.
Matt: 16 total from the shot, okay.
Laura: 16 damage from the shot, as far as I know.
Matt: It's your normal arrow damage plus whatever it tells you to roll on that.
Laura: I get another of my arrow damage?
Matt: It's your arrow damage, and then that on top of it.
Laura: What?! I didn't know that! That's so cool!
Liam: How far is he from us at this point?
Matt: At this point, he's--
Laura: Is it sneak attack?
Matt: He did not see you, so yes.
Sam: What are you restraining?
Laura: The thing on top. Hopefully he doesn't have a hold of the reins, so-- Now I've lost track. 28 damage plus the 16 from the Bramble Shot.
Matt: Gotcha. As you reach out and fire the arrow, you watch him glance over the wall. His eyes go wide as the arrow (impact) pierces his chest and sprouts into 20 to 25 tiny bramble-like vines that wrap around him and wrap around his body as he gets pushed back and falls off the back of the wyvern, out of sight. Make a perception check.
Laura: Okay. 21?
Matt: Okay. As you see his expression as he falls back, it jogs your memory a little bit. You do recognize him. This is Gatekeeper Xanthas. He was the gatekeeper at the Traverse Junction in the Emon Alabaster Lyceum, the place that had the Teleportation Circles, the guy who was always at the desk waiting for you every time.
Laura: Oh, that guy! That was annoyed with us every time we--
Marisha: He hated us?
Matt: He was annoyed with you.
Marisha: He hated us. What's his name?
Matt: Xanthas. Gatekeeper Xanthas. You watch him just get thrown off the back of the wyvern, slammed past, out of sight.
Marisha: Hey, wonder why we hated him, we can't remember his name, Seeker Xanthas.
Sam: Huh, why is he here? Odd.
Laura: I don't know.
Marisha: Well, if he's from Emon, and Emon is currently under Thordak's reign--
Laura: Yeah, he's probably working for him.
Travis: I think we should trust him.
Laura: We should definitely trust him.
Taliesin: He's currently a veggie burrito at the moment, let's keep him that way.
Laura: Should I fly towards him?
Taliesin: I dunno. Why are you asking--?
Laura: I'm going to fly. I'm going to try get towards him.
Taliesin: I'm having my own problem.
Matt: So, at full speed on your broom, broom speed is what again? It should be on the broom.
Laura: I don't have a broom paper. I never got a broom paper because I kind of stole it. It wasn't given to me.
Matt: I'm sure it does have one. I'll look it up right now, but you need to keep in mind what your movement is on your broom.
Laura: I think it's like 120.
Marisha: It's, like, exactly what I need to get there. How far away is he? It's that much.
Matt: It's like, ten
Travis: It's 40. I'm saying it's 40.
Laura: No. It's, I'd say, 50.
Matt: Flying speed  50 feet.
Travis: Don't raise your hand like you got it right.
Laura: I did! I said 50, right before he said it.
Sam: Yes, you also said ten, 120, 180 and 50.
Travis: It's playing Rock-Paper-Scissors and going-- Got it!
Matt: As you rush in on the broom and look over, the wyvern still has its claws up on the edge of the walls, (snarls), looking around. You can see it's taken a few hits, a few arrows sticking out of it. However, from the explosion that happened, the two ballistae up there don't appear to be damaged. But you have no current view of Xanthas.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So, that ending your turn, that brings us to Vax.
Liam: Jeez. How far away is that little rock right at the bottom of that platform that you've got Vex on? How far is that from me?
Matt: That rock? It's about maybe 40 feet?
Liam: And how high is the wall?
Matt: Up here? Probably about 30 feet tall.
Liam: Okay. Do I see any wood or anything, a barrel or anything besides stone sticking out?
Matt: No. Not in that rock, no. It's a piece of stone that's sticking out.
Liam: I am going to hold everything until the rest of the party goes this round.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth?
Marisha: Okay. Is there anyone else coming at us?
Matt: Currently, no.There are a number of the wyvern riders and-- going to place these guys over here so I go and do that-- You do see lizardmen off to the side that are in the middle of a struggle. A soldier over there, and a number of lizardmen that are currently bashing at the front gates, trying to get through the main door into the--
Marisha: Okay. Where did you say where the wyvern riders were, again? Roughly, in the air?
Matt: You have three that are on the ground right now that have nets thrown over them or chains pulled across, holding them down. And there are a number that are high up in the air right now, circling, looking for a way to swoop down and grab somebody. A few have their eyes on Vex.
Marisha: Are they clustering together?
Matt: They're maybe 40 feet apart right now.
Marisha: Oh, yeah? They're each 40 feet?
Matt: At the least.
Marisha: Fuck. Okay, you know what? And how far away am I from them?
Matt: From the closest one to you? About 80 feet.
Marisha: Jesus.
Taliesin: We have to start moving in a direction.
Travis: Towards the door, right? And then try to get the--
Marisha: I was going to try and get these guys out, but okay. How many are busting through the door? How many lizardmen?
Matt: There are currently six pushed against it. And there are a few that are moving off in this direction to go join them.
Marisha: To bust through. Those are bad guys?
Matt: Yeah. They're currently slamming into the door and hitting it and trying to find their way through.
Marisha: Well, let's Fireball them again. That was fun!
Matt: Okay!
Travis: Will it set the gate on fire?
Taliesin: Not if you place it right.
Matt: From what you can tell and what you remember, the gate itself is mostly stone and iron.
Marisha: So let's blow that shit up.
Matt: All right. So keep track of the charges you're using. They all fail.
Marisha: I can see both of them.
Travis: They all fail?
Matt: Yeah, they all fail. Rolling nothing tonight.
Marisha: Oh, I have another eight. All of them? All six of them? I'm drunk with power. It's 6d8?
Sam: No, 8d6.
Marisha: 8d6! (counts)
Taliesin: Reroll.
Marisha: Yeah, I get to reroll ones.
Sam: Cocked.
Marisha: That's also cocked. That one bumped it from what it was--
Sam: It was a four.
Marisha: It was a four, okay. So six, ten, 18, 20, five, 30 again. No, 31!
Matt: 31. (explosion) This one seed of arcane red energy that shoots forth from the staff slams into the door, and you watch as they're all thrown backwards, screaming through the air, the blast incinerating their bodies and scattering them to the four winds.
Laura: Fucking shit, Keyleth!
Liam: Fire walk with me, Red.
Marisha: I feel like this thing should come with a child warning. Oh, jeez.
Travis: Wait, that smoked all of them?
Matt: All of those there, yeah. You see groups of wyvern riders that are currently fighting off the guards. Keyleth, do you want to move or are you staying there?
Marisha: We were all running towards the door, right? We're all trying to get in?
Matt: That's up to you.
Marisha: We're all trying to get in?
Taliesin: I'm heading that way.
Marisha: I start heading that way.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Why'd you say it so nonchalant?
Laura: Oh no, oh no!
Marisha: It's always like it's a bad idea.
Matt: I'm asking if you'd-- Vax stayed there. Up to you.
Marisha: Well, he held his turn.
Liam: Yep. I can't do anything now. I have to wait until everyone's done.
Matt: Yeah. You are staying here. All right, ends Keyleth's turn, Percival, what are you doing?
Taliesin: I'm going to use my action to try and clear my gun.
Matt: Okay. Tinkering check.
Taliesin: Tinkering check, so that's nice. It's 18! It's fine!
Matt: All right. You get the gun to function.
Taliesin: I take six steps forward.
Sam: (sings) I take six steps back.
Taliesin: And then I use my bonus action...
Liam: (singing) We go together because--
Laura: (singing) We go together because--
Sam: (singing) We go together because--
All: (singing) --opposites attract! And you know--
Matt: It's not your turn, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, sorry. (laughter)
Taliesin: I'm going to use my bonus action to move my Hex to one of the wyverns that is currently under the net.
Matt: Right here? The wyvern or the rider?
Taliesin: The wyvern. Yeah. It's fighting everybody too, right?
Matt: Correct. It's thrashing about.
Taliesin: Okay, it's going to make life easier for everybody.
Matt: Cool. So that finishes your round then, Percy. Scanlan, now it's your turn.
Sam: Oh! I'll move forward with the rest of the gang, if I can. I don't know. I'll Lightning Bolt the wyvern up there who was holding the elf. Not knowing what he is or if he's good or bad.
Matt: You're rushing forward on your tiny, gnome feet, arm out in front, release a bolt of energy that slams into the front of the edge of the tower itself. And as you coast it upward, it burns a dark spot across the stonework before slamming into the wyvern itself. The wyvern tries to dodge out of the way. What is the DC on that?
Sam: That would be 19, since I didn't call it.
Matt: That's true.
Travis: (sings) That's true.
Matt: (sings) That's true. (speaking) No, it does not succeed!
Sam: Okay.
Matt: It has no dex bonus, so it's a straight 15.
Sam: 8d6? Wow! 37!
Matt: (explosion) It hits the wyvern, who's already taken a few blows. It shrieks back, looks down, its eyes zeroed in on you, its wings out, looks like it's about to go into a jumping dive. Okay.
Sam: Oh, I will also inspire Vax with a dirty limerick.
Liam: Give it to me.
Sam: So, this is a random-- There was a young lady named Spruce/ whose favorite thrill was a goose/ Just the sight of a thumb/ made her tuchus all numb/ and her bowels got excited and loose.
Travis: Oh god! (groans in disgust)
Taliesin: Why? Why?!
Travis: Where did you? Where?! What?!
Liam: I feel so brave. (laughter)
Sam: Let that story inspire you, Vax! Don't be loose like her bowels! Be firm like a mighty oak! (laughter)
Liam: I stand a full inch taller now.
Matt: You do. And take your d12 inspiration die.
Taliesin: This is not what this book was meant for!
Liam: It's from the frogurt shop. (laughter)
Marisha: His ability to weaponize things--
Taliesin: I'm going to get a volume for next Christmas.
Matt: All righty. And with that, ending your turn, the wyvern up at the top swoops down, right up to you, Scanlan. Mouth open, stinger out to the side.
Sam: I'll Cutting Words this one.
Matt: Okay. Well, its bite goes to strike you and I can almost guarantee you it misses with a 14. The stinger, however (whoosh).
Sam: Oh wait! No, no. That hits.
Taliesin: You have a plus two.
Sam: No, I think I only have a plus two if I-- No, I think it's a straight 14 because I don't wear anything anymore.
Matt: That's true, you didn't-- All right, so.
Laura: You took off all your armor?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: If you have the armor on, it doesn't have to be attuned, you still get some--
Sam: I think I'm at 12, plus the armor that I'm wearing is plus two, so.
Matt: So it's 14. That does hit you exactly, yeah.
Sam: But I said I was going to Cutting Words it, which probably should help.
Matt: Go for it. So go ahead and--
Sam: Eight.
Matt: Eight. Okay. The bite goes to clamp down, and as you--
Sam: Oh! As I look at him, I-- shit! I-- Ah! I just show him my chest hair. I tuft it out into a quick little ponytail.
Matt: The wyvern pulls back its head, confused, and the jaw snaps shut as it rears, its wings out, strangely. Its tail comes back, angrily. How many bardic inspiration die have you spent since your last battle, by the way?
Sam: I only spent one on the last battle. I did a bunch of reactions last battle, but I only used one inspiration last battle.
Matt: Right. Cutting Words also uses a bardic inspiration, I believe--
Sam: Oh, it does? Then this is five.
Matt: I believe... Let me check.
Sam: I used three Cutting Words last time, and one inspiration.
Matt: Yeah, you have to use your bardic inspiration dice. So that's five.
Sam: So this is five. And I think I have six total? No?
Matt: You get as many as your wisdom modifier-- I'm sorry, your charisma modifier.
Sam: That's six. So yeah, I have one more.
Matt: One more. So the stinger comes swooping down towards you, and that is a nine! It rolled a two. The tail whips past your head, no impact.
Laura: You're just so teeny, Scanlan.
Sam: I am.
Matt: Pike's turn! Pike rushing forward as (panting). Looking around, who here looks pretty rough, if anybody?
Laura: Percy.
Taliesin: I'm a little rough, I could use some love.
Marisha: And I could use some love.
Taliesin: Yeah, either of us. I'm a little lower than you. But you're--
Marisha: I'm running with Percy.
Taliesin: Yeah. We're together.
Marisha: If she wants to give us a group hug?
Matt: Well, she can only get up to you right now, Keyleth, at the moment.
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: Because of her stumpy legs.
Marisha: Sorry.
Taliesin: Stumpy legs.
Laura: They're slender and fabulous! All right?
Sam: Yeah. They're muscular. Svelte.
Liam: Monster calves.
Matt: Fucking stumpy! (laughter)
Matt: She's going to use her 3rd-level Cure Wounds on you, Keyleth.
Marisha: Aw, thanks, Pike!
Matt: Two eights and a five. This is 16, 21, plus five. You heal 26 hit points. That was a really good healing roll for a level three. All righty. That ends Pike's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah! So, I'll run up, because nobody fucks with Scanlan when I'm around. So I run up to the wyvern. Yeah. And I would like to take my axe and swing it in its stupid face.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Reckless Attack. Great Weapon Master.
Sam: Frenzy. Rage.
Laura: All of it. (growling) All of it!
Matt: He's not frenzied yet.
Travis: 28 minus five is 23.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: How'd you do that, Grog?!
Travis: Shhh!
Sam: Doing the math?
Travis: 25 plus ten is 35.
Matt: Okay. Second strike, you want to do it? As you rush and slam the axe into its side, it buries a good three inches into the chest, and as it's pulled back, its tail is still recoiling from the attack on Scanlan. Looks back to you and you see its attention's geared on you, but it's pretty rough.
Travis: Pretty rough? Yeah! I just want to finish off this little meat popsicle.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Travis: Same thing.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 19 plus a million. 33. No! Minus five. 28.
Matt: 28. As you pull the axe out this time, as it's rearing back and looking angrily at you, you chuckle to yourself as you throw the axe up in the air. It spins once and you catch it, and you jam it right in the center of its skull. It goes from rearing angrily to lights out. And it hits the ground instantaneously, collapsing into a heap as you wedge the blade out from the center of its forehead.
Travis: Amazing. Can I use my--
Matt: You still have about 20 feet of movement, by the way.
Travis: Can I-- Yeah. I'll move towards the group on the left.
Matt: That side?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Don't you get an attack again if you killed something?
Travis: Oh! Oh! Yes! Thank you! Very good point! With my bloodaxe, if I kill a creature, I gain ten temporary hit points.
Matt: Yeah. So you now have ten temporary hit points on top of what you had.
Travis: Beautiful. And I don't think I get another hit. It's only criticals that I--
Laura: Oh! Okay. Well, still.
Travis: But still, yeah, yeah.
Matt: All right. So that ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: That's the end of the round.
Liam: Do I have a go? Do I get to go?
Matt: That's right. You held to wait until everybody else has a go.
Liam: Question  can I call out, Vex! Catch!
Laura: Huh?
Liam: And softball-pitch Whisper up to her?
Matt: Okay. So you-- go ahead and roll an attack roll.
Laura: It just stabs me.
Liam: Sure. 26.
Matt: 26. Okay. As the dagger whips up past you, you look down and see the thrown dagger. Do you want to try and catch it?
Laura: Sure.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: This should be pretty good.
Laura: Where's my thing?
Liam: This does involve me. Can I use my Luck for her to re-roll that?
Laura: 21.
Matt: No, unfortunately. You reach out and catch the blade and it cuts across your hand a little bit. Which at that point, if you want to--
Liam: Bamf!
Matt: As your turn to travel with it, it's the damage that needs to happen, it's the impact. So you do take four points of piercing damage, as you try and catch it from the front of the blade in your hand, and the speed at which it's thrown is-- you feel the impact--
Laura: And then I brace the broom to catch him--
Matt: At which point, the blade, all of a sudden, swirls with dark, shadow energy and your brother appears at your side.
Liam: And I would like to use my bonus action to cast Lay on Hands and give her four hit points.
Laura: Aww, buddy! (laughs) That's so great.
Liam: That's it, just four. I get to choose how many
Laura: Thanks! I catch him on the broom and hand him the--
Liam: And I'll use my movement to scooch my uncomfortable crotch onto this stick you ride all over the place. (groans)
Matt: All righty. Your movement is now, on the broom, reduced to 20 feet, with two people on it.
Liam: Cool.
Laura: What are you going to do?
Matt: At which point, you see the wyverns and the riders start thrashing about. Some of them have spears that're jamming out from the middle of the net. You watch as this guy spins around and takes out three out of the guards that all just collapse to the ground. One takes a stinger to the face, another one gets bitten and has its head broken in the process, while a third one gets a spear to the front of the chest.
Marisha: This wyvern asshole did that?
Matt: Over here, yeah. He's hurt, but he's been taking out a lot of the guards along the way. The rest of these lizard guards do a full double dash this way past that guard there, who's giving chase. These guys all rush up to try and make their way to the front door again. They can't really do anything yet to the door, but they can get there. At this point in time--
Sam: Oh boy.
Matt: Vex, Vax.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: From your vantage point, up at the top on the broom, you hear this distant echoing horn sound, this (low horn noise).
Laura: Shit.
Matt: It's echoing through the valley. You glance over your shoulder and you see a bead of burning red light making its way in your direction. Wings flapping. It's closer than you think, and as it comes closer and closer towards you--
Laura: Thordak comes and kills us all, right?!
Marisha: Yeah, this is-- Happy 2016!
Matt: You feel the blood rush from your face as your immediate instinct is, "Oh god. The Cinder King is here." While there are flames involved, the size is not as immense as you would expect from Thordak. Instead what you see is a large, red, winged bird with flames trailing off the edges of its wings flapping in your direction, coming over the wall on the outside of the fortress. On its back you see a humanoid, but much larger than anyone of your size, armored with dark black and grayish-silver-trimmed iron armor, a giant maul in one hand, itself reddish flame-like hair. This is a fire giant, similar to the ones you encountered in the City of Brass, riding on the back of this ember-roc-type creature. As it comes cruising over the top, you hear it, holding a horn in its other hand, start shouting out, "The Cinder King calls for swift execution! I deliver his hate with absolute strength." And it swoops into a dive toward the front side of the gate. At a full speed at this point, it coasts right beneath both of you, swinging the hammer in the air. I need both of you guys to make dexterity saving throws.
Liam: Would evasion work for this?
Matt: No. Well, evasion is against any spell.
Liam: Spell, that's what I thought, I just wanted to check.
Laura: Do we get advantage for anything?
Matt: Let me check quick. (laughs) You do not get advantage for anything.
Laura: (laughs) Why, though?
Matt: But I admire you checking for any given possibility.
Laura: 16 for me.
Liam: I'm going to use my last Luck.
Sam: You have inspiration.
Liam: Oh, I do, and I can add it to that save, right?
Sam: Sure.
Liam: Good. Oh, then I'm 29. I rolled 11 off of that. Thanks for the limerick.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: 16.
Matt: 16? Okay. So you manage to lift up onto the broom, almost doing a complete handstand to get out of the way, however, the bottom of it catches your sister in the side of her leg, causes the broom to lurch, and begin to lose control of it. You both manage to hold on to the broom.
Laura: That's good.
Matt: But you, from the impact of the hammer, do suffer 16 points of bludgeoning damage. As the bird, now in a full dive, slams in a giant fiery crash into the front two gates of the keep.
Liam: How close was it to us? If it hit us?
Matt: It swooped right underneath you.
Liam: Can I do an attack of opportunity?
Matt: No, because you were trying to get out of the way.
Liam: All right.
Matt: To do that, you would have been fully off the broom and you would fall.
Liam: Understand, understand.
Matt: As it (swoosh) into this full dive, slams into the two front gates which explode into a cloud of dust, broken rock, masonry, and iron. You watch as the dust settles briefly. Now the giant is stepping off of the back of this giant flaming bird and looks around, clutching its hammer in its hand.
Laura: Fuck. (yelling)
Sam: That's large! That's like from a different set of action figures.
Travis: I think the scale is wrong, Matt, I think you accidentally put things that are bigger than us on the map.
Laura: This is like when I made my Barbies date my G.I. Joes. (laughter)
Marisha: Why is G.I. Joe so much shorter than Barbie? Damn it!
Taliesin: Did the lizard man take damage, by the way?
Matt: Actually yeah, as the dust clears, the lizard men that were at the gate were all destroyed in the impact, crushed, their bones broken, and you can see one arm twitching out of the center of the rubble. The doors are currently blown open and off the hinges, there.
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: All righty, and then--
Sam: We need some sort of miracle here! What we need is some sort of miracle!
Matt: Fresh off the airplane.
Ashley: Hello, everybody!
Liam: Divine Intervention!
Sam: (singing) We need a hero!
Matt: That is awesome.
Ashley: I've lost my voice a little bit, but you know what? Fuck it! Der-n-der!
Matt: I want a shirt that says that. "Fuck it! Der-n-der!"
Travis: They'll get that in the store as soon as possible.
Matt: Indeed. All righty, so, bringing us to the top. As they both stand there, the flames still emanating out from the impact, the lizardmen scattered and broken at the gate, the battle still waging on in the vicinity, you see as two other battles over here, the wyvern rider on this wyvern is stabbed in the head and is killed. The wyvern is still around, but it takes another guard out behind it. Over here, this guy continues to fight and takes out two of the guards, but there is still one behind that is holding strong. Top of the round, Vex. What do you want to do, as you just barely gather control over the broom again?
Laura: Is that within range of you, to throw something at it and bamf there, or--?
Liam: Ish. We'll find out.
Laura: I'm going to try to fly over. Am I able to get to the roof above him?
Matt: Over here? Yeah, you can.
Laura: Okay, I'll go there and land.
Matt: Okay. So you both make your way over, landing on the roof. There you can see Xanthas is still bound by the vines, his eyes wide. He's like, "What are you doing? Release me!"
Laura: I'm going to ignore him and Hunter's Mark the giant, and then try to hit him from above.
Matt: Okay, so, getting right up to the edge, arrow off to the side, go for it.
Laura: 21 on the first one.
Matt: 21 on the first one? Hits.
Laura: Yes! And that's Hunter's Mark and sneak attack, right?
Matt: Technically, he went past you, saw you, impacted you with him-- or she did, sorry-- It is well aware where you went and knows that you-- There's no sneak attack. I'm sorry.
Laura: Damn it! Fine, fine.
Matt: You'd have to hide somewhere to try and get sneak attack.
Laura: Oh, and that's a bonus action, right?
Matt: Correct. Which you used to move your Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Which I did, yeah, so don't worry about it.
Matt: Vax, you're up on deck.
Laura: 18 plus four lightning damage.
Matt: 18 plus four, nice.
Laura: Oh, and then again! I attack him again!
Matt: Go for it! One arrow--
Laura: And it definitely hits him! It's, like, 30-something.
Matt: Sure, that hits! Go for it.
Laura: Argh. 17 plus four lightning damage!
Matt: All righty. Both arrows (impact). One slams into the armor and sticks into it about three or four inches, and you can see the giant female fire giant glances at her shoulder angrily and looks up over the top, at you.
Laura: Oh, and I want to back up away. I want to back away from the--
Travis: I will woo her.
Laura: So she can't see me no more!
Matt: At the full movement it would've taken you to get there, with your brother on your back, that's as far as you can get.
Laura: Can I crouch? Is that within my movement, to crouch?
Matt: You're crouching, but you're not hiding. You do have some cover because of the edge of the wall. She sees you, but you have a little bit of cover. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Is the giant within 60 feet of me?
Matt: The giant may or may not be. You currently have to get over to the edge to see it.
Liam: All right, so I'm going to move up to the edge. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark.
Sam: You can't do that! That's not one of your spells!
Laura: We're twins, you guys!
Travis: Oh my god, I'm going to barf.
Matt: That's from being a vengeance paladin?
Liam: Vengeance paladin, yes. Level up! And then I'm going to throw Whisper at the back of her head and hope that it hits.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Jeebus. Let's try that again. That is-- I'm going to use--
Laura: No, that's a good hit!
Liam: Mm, yeah. 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Liam: All right. Okay. So-- and I'm going to bamf there.
Matt: Okay. No sneak attack on this.
Liam: No, I know. And the damage is 12 plus psychic damage is eight! 20. And then I want to use my movement, even though I can't disengage--
Matt: Did you roll your Hunter's Mark on that?
Liam: Oh, no, I-- Thanks, Mattie!
Matt: You just used it!
Liam: 21. Just one.
Marisha: Now people are going to scream "Hunter's Mark!" at you on the internet!
Liam: I can't wait! I love you internet! I love you so much! And then, even though I'm not using disengage, I'm going to use my movement to back the fuck up into that doorway.
Matt: Okay. As you back up into that doorway, she swings around, the giant maul arcing in your direction. A great maul, actually, specifically. That is 24 to hit.
Liam: I'll use Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Okay, in order to take half damage? All righty, so, that comes to-- oof. This is going to be fun for you.
Liam: So much fun.
Matt: All righty, let's get the dice out for this. Oh, I have the wrong dice. There we go.
Liam: Guys, I have 105 hit points. I am swole.
Marisha: Welcome to triple digits! Congratulations, you joined the rest of us!
Matt: You take 31 bludgeoning damage, halved to 15. It-- whack!-- slams you into the shoulder. You dodge out of the way and the momentum actually hits you and the inertia shoves you into the side of the doorway. You catch yourself.
Liam: Thank you! (grunting)
Matt: All right, that ends your turn? Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay, I am going to Tidal Wave these motherfuckers. Yeah! Still have that packed from the Fire Plane, what's up! So I don't have a-- do we have a laser pointer in the house?
Taliesin: It's not in your bag?
Marisha: You know, it's funny. We bought, like, ten laser pointers, forever ago.
Sam: You know, it's fine. Matt will just point at random until he finds the spot that you're looking for.
Taliesin: Warmer, warmer, colder, colder, warmer.
Marisha: I had a laser pointer.
Liam: Here's one, here's one.
Marisha: Hey, I think this is mine!
Travis: Yeah, sure it is!
Liam: Use it!
Sam: Tidal Wave!
Marisha: Yeah, 30 feet long, ten foot wide, ten foot tall. Everything must make a dexterity save.
Matt: So you're trying to do it this way?
Marisha: That's exactly what I'm doing.
Matt: All right, so it comes bursting through. All right, they both need to make a dexterity saving throw against a DC 19, correct?
Laura: 19, yes, right?
Marisha: Yep!
Matt: That is a 17 for the giant, no. And that is a seven for the roc. So no, they both take 4d8 bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: And they are knocked prone, and if they are flamey, then all unprotected flames are distinguished.
Sam: Extinguished.
Matt: It is the creature's nature--
Taliesin: They're very distinguished. They have little fun mustaches.
Marisha: They're dapper!
Matt: They both fall prone, but the nature of their flames is natural. It is part of their actual physicality, so the flames do not get extinguished.
Marisha: So they don't take extra water damage? So 4d8?
Matt: No, but the water does slam into the bird. You see steam rise up as it impacts. The flames darken a little bit and subside briefly. Both of them are knocked off their feet into the ground as you watch the tidal wave curl up, slam into both of them, and then spill out and spread across the ground, putting out this fire here, actually.
Marisha: So 21 damage, and they're knocked prone. 21 damage.
Matt: Yep, great. That finishes your turn, Keyleth, or do you want to move?
Marisha: I'll stay where I am, actually.
Matt: Okay. That brings us to the general, as she stands.
Laura: Oh god, she's a general!
Matt: At half of her movement there. She, extremely angry, gets up. (growls) "Oh, that's not playing fair!"
Marisha: You looked like you needed a bath!
Matt: Looks back at a piece of the rubble, grabs it-- actually is going to use her Flaming Anger, which is an ability she has. She gets extremely furious and tenses up. You can see muscles bulging in her forehead. She grabs a big chunk of the nearby rubble. You watch as the rubble, already on fire from the impact, the fiery impact of the site, begins to heat up. Lobs it at you.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: That is a natural one. As it goes whoosh, and tumbles past--
Marisha: Can I watch it, be like--
Matt: Yeah, it goes off and actually impacts one of the wyverns flying through the sky and hits it. It goes down over the outer wall.
Liam: Echoing from in the gate, you hear, woo!
Marisha: You've got a good arm!
Matt: Using her Flaming Anger, however, she angrily grabs another piece, this one even larger. Both hands over the head, the great maul hanging at her side, and throws it at you. This time, that is a 19 to hit.
Marisha: Heh, uh, yeah. That hits.
Matt: Okay. You suffer 33 points of bludgeoning damage from the impact, plus ten points of fire damage from the heat, as it slams into you, almost knocking you onto your back. You manage to catch yourself, but the pieces of it hit you and then break apart and fall to the ground around you. You find your whole front side charred from the impact. With the rest of her movement, is going to-- let's see, she only has 20 feet. One, two, three, four, in your direction, picking her great maul up with her hand and swinging it. Thank you, boyfriend glasses delivery. Ends the general's turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay!
Matt: Scanlan, you're on deck.
Marisha: She throws rocks!
Taliesin: Okay, now that this is happening, I've decided-- I'm already committed to this wyvern and rider over in the corner that have not ceased to be a problem. I assume that they have not ceased to be a problem at this point.
Matt: They're not currently harrying you, no. They're fighting off guards.
Taliesin: But they're going to become a problem if they kill those guards.
Matt: Possibly. If they kill the guards.
Taliesin: Okay, that'll do! So I'm going to take three shots at that wyvern. I'm going to start shooting at the wyvern. So, first attack. He's held down by a net?
Matt: He is, but two of the guys who were holding the net have died off, so it's almost negligible at this point. He can't get the wings going, but if the net is removed or he manages to get the net off, it'll be fine.
Taliesin: All right, I'll take a sharpshooter shot at him. So, that's-- oh, for the fuck's sake. That's a gun jam.
Laura: Oh no!
Taliesin: Yep, that's another one.
Sam: How many guns you got?
Taliesin: I've got a lot, but I keep-- Ugh, god, that hurt. Okay. That really hurt. Took ten points of psychic damage, because that's funny. I'm irritated. I'm putting that away and I'm pulling out Bad News and taking a shot with Bad News at him because I've got just enough of a round to do that. Another sharpshooter shot, because I'm irritated. Come on. Oh, for fuck's sake.
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: Did you die?
Taliesin: Yeah, I died. I'm dead.
Matt: In a terrible round for Percy, as you walk forward in the center, you turn to the side, fire at the wyvern, get one shot that immediately locks up. You feel the reeling feedback, psychic feedback from Animus, course through you. You put it away, pull out Bad News, take aim. As you fire, that horrible silent click sound as you pull back. You hold it away from you, just in time, as the flame backs up in the butt end of the weapon just flares outward. You can see, this is going to need a little work to get it working again.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, but this is getting stupid. You know, it's almost worth-- It really does suck. That legit sucks.
Matt: You want to move, or anything else you want to do on your turn?
Taliesin: Oh yeah, no, I am. I'm paying a deadly price for this shit right now. I'm going to run toward the-- that's some sort of bastille weapon over there? Is there a-- No, to your-- yeah, right there.
Matt: Right there? That is a crate and a chest.
Taliesin: What's the thing in the circle?
Matt: Oh, this right here, you mean? Oh, that is one of the trebuchets that you had repaired and one of the ones that isn't damaged yet.
Taliesin: I'm running toward it.
Sam: Oh yeah, use the battlefield!
Marisha: Press 'x' to use!
Matt: There you go. It is loaded. It has not been used. It looks like the men that were currently fighting the wyvern across the way had loaded it up and then were assaulted when they threw the net over. So it currently is ready for use.
Taliesin: Okay!
Marisha: Hot.
Matt: It is a difficult thing to aim. That ends Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm going to move over to the right, towards Grog, a bit. Just to get away from everybody else. And I will-- We need to hit this giant, right?
Laura: Yeah! Kill it!
Sam: So I will (sings) Bigby's Hand! But I have very few spell slots left, so it's going to have to be at level seven.
Matt: Okay. 7th-level Bigby's Hand.
Sam: I will punch him in his giant solar plexus.
Matt: The giant?
Sam: Her! Her giant solar plexus. It's a she.
Matt: Yes it is.
Liam: It's ten feet above your head.
Sam: Okay. With my hand cone, if that helps.
Liam: Fuck, that shirt.
Matt: With your hand cone.
Liam: Hold the hand cone to the shirt.
Laura: Just, like, right here. (laughter)
Matt: All righty, so Bigby's Hand appears, goes into a Clenched Fist. Go ahead and make a spell attack.
Sam: Oh! Because it's a melee attack-- spell attack?
Matt: Correct.
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21 hits! And so it's cast at seventh level.
Sam: Yes, it's 8d8.
Laura: Whoa!
Liam: So handsome!
Sam: Do you have any d8s over here?
Taliesin: I do. There's another d8.
Marisha: Here's some more.
Sam: Okay. Oh wow! That's all of them. That's eight.
Marisha: It feels better that way. Ooh! Those are good rolls!
Taliesin: Those are very nice-looking d8s.
Matt: Oh, Vax? I also need you to make a constitution saving roll.
Liam: Great.
Sam: 40.
Matt: 40! Ooh!
Liam: For what?
Matt: You have a concentration check for your Hunter's Mark?
Liam: Oh, awesome! I love-- I know all about spells! It's a one.
Laura: Oh no!
Liam: But I have Luck, so I'm going to roll again
Matt: Okay. Go ahead.
Liam: I have Luck! It's within the rules, yeah. Concentration, straight--
Matt: No-- constitution, yeah.
Liam: Constitution, straight 16.
Matt: Okay, you maintain concentration, you're fine. All right, so, as you conjure Bigby's Hand, you see the purple energy trail off your fingers, and as your bring your hand back into an uppercut motion, you watch as the air in front of the giant, and she begins stomping forward in the direction of Keyleth and Pike, the energy forms into this giant purple fist of smoke that just sucker-punches her right in the gut. She looks down, confused and angry, at this fist that turns into a middle finger immediately. (laughter)
Ashley: Yeah!
Sam: You know me well.
Matt: You've moved ten feet that way. You still have--
Sam: Is anyone within range of my Healing Words?
Matt: You have, looks to be Pike, Keyleth and Grog all within range.
Sam: Keyleth's hurt, right?
Marisha: I am hurt.
Sam: Okay. I will give her some Healing Words.
Matt: Second level?
Marisha: Heal me. With your words.
Sam: I will heal you with my words. So that's 2d4 plus six, right? Wow, awesome. Eight. (laughter)
Marisha: All right. I'll take it.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Yeah, 71 hit points.
Matt: There you go. That ends Scanlan's turn. All right, so. Vex, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw, if you could?
Laura: Oh, that asshole that I'm standing next to. Fucking dick!
Ashley: Get him.
Laura: That's a seven.
Matt: It's a seven. As you, looking off the side, getting your arrows ready for a second round, you can hear a couple of whispers off to your side. As you glance over, you make eye contact with Xanthas, who has managed to shrug off the bramble vines around his body. As soon as he finishes talking, he points a finger towards you. And you're listening. You snap to attention.
Sam: Oh no.
Matt: And he goes, "Why don't you take a walk off the edge of that tower right there?"
Ashley: No!
Sam: (whispers) Wait a second, you can't do that!
Laura: But when I'm doing it, I'm also still intelligent, right?
Matt: You're still intelligent, oh.
Travis: Oh, and you look good doing it. You look good walking right off that edge.
Laura: I'm going to walk off of it. I look at him, I walk off it. Can I pull out my broom as I walk off the edge and land on the broom? Because I did what he told me, technically?
Matt: Yeah, so he's a--
Ashley: But he didn't say to not use your broom.
Matt: Just double-checking to make sure I could make him do this.
All: (singing) Off the catwalk.
Sam: I don't think you can command someone to hurt themselves.
Matt: It doesn't say that you can't.
Sam: Really?
Laura: Really?!
Matt: Each time it takes damage, it gets to retake the saving throw.
Taliesin: Once you complete his instructions, you can do anything you want.
Laura: No, that's what I mean. I'm going to walk off the edge and pull out the broom.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And just fly.
Matt: Okay. Yeah. So you come up and you go off the edge. And you have the broom there. All right. And you're coasting there with your broom.
Laura: And I give him a thumbs-up. Thanks, Boss!
Matt: And he darts down the stairs into the building. And as he's rushing off, he's like, "All right. Shoot your friends!" (laughter)
Matt: He shouts it over his shoulder as he goes. (laughter)
Liam: That was awesome.
Matt: So now it is Pike's turn.
Ashley: Okay. So, getting up to speed here. So Percy's kind of low?
Travis: Percy!
Taliesin: Yes, I'm low.
Ashley: Okay. I have on my Sprinter's Boots.
Marisha: You're next to me.
Ashley: I'm next to you?
Laura: And Percy's over by the trebuchet in the corner.
Ashley: Can I make it to the trebuchet in the corner with my Sprinter's Boots or even without?
Matt: Not without, you couldn't. You could, but it would take your whole turn.
Ashley: Okay, then I will use my Sprinter's Boots.
Matt: All right.
Liam: You sound like you're an actual gnome.
Laura: Yeah, you really do.
Matt: You get over there at the trebuchet.
Ashley: Okay. So I'll cast Cure Wounds-- Percy?
Laura: Taliesin, you guys are talking so loud.
Sam: Controversial spell use over here-- Controversial! It will be addressed on Talks Machina!
Taliesin: He's trying to argue that you'll be taking damage and I'm trying to show him that he's wrong.
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Laura: Thank you, Percy.
Taliesin: You're welcome.
Laura: Damn you, Scanlan.
Sam: If I were DM-ing--
Liam: (air horn sounds) (laughter)
Liam: Is that okay?
Matt: I'll allow it.
Liam: It was on them.
Matt: Pike?
Ashley: No, because now I can't do it to Scanlan. Okay, so what are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 59.
Ashley: Okay. So let's do a 3rd-level Cure Wounds.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Matt: Okay. by the way, you used one earlier. So you have one more 3rd-level spell slot after this.
Laura: Matt did a 3rd-level spell.
Matt: Before you got here. Just so you know.
Ashley: Okay. Maybe I should do-- I'm going to do a fourth level. Because we need you.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm not very-- I'm not being very useful at the moment, but yeah. I'll get back there.
Ashley: Well, you're at the trebuchet now. Okay.
Matt: Grog, you're on deck, by the way.
Travis: Can I ask you a question while she's waiting?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: A prone enemy. Do you get advantage on them? If they're prone?
Matt: If they are prone, with melee attacks in the vicinity?
Travis: That's a natural crit, right? No, that's--
Matt: No, it has advantage if you're within five feet of it.
Travis: Got it.
Ashley: 23.
Laura: 23, Percy!
Taliesin: Yay! Thank you!
Ashley: And then-- shoot! I was going to do something before I moved, but I forgot. So now, for my bonus action, I'm going to create a beautiful, divine sword, Spiritual Weapon, and put it up to the belly of the giant.
Sam: Ooh, yeah!
Matt: All right. At what level are you casting this?
Laura: (whispers) Cast it really high.
Matt: You've already used your 3rd-level-- 4th-level spell, so you have to use your 2nd-level.
Ashley: I have four 3rd-levels, so I think I actually have an extra 3rd-level. Because of the necklace.
Matt: Okay. You have an extra one, then. But do keep in mind, you've already cast a 3rd-level spell this round-- a 4th-level spell, so if you're doing a bonus action, it can only be 2nd-level or lower. So it would be at 2nd-level.
Ashley: All right.
Sam: Can you use four 3rd-level spells to be one 12th-level spell? (laughter)
Matt: Sure. Why not? (laughter)
Marisha: Because I want to do a Fire-transport-via-plants-ball.
Ashley: Okay, I'll just do it at second.
Matt: That would be messy.
Ashley: I'll just do it at second level, then.
Matt: Okay. All right, that ends your turn, Pike? All right. Grog?
Travis: I'll run up to the bird-fire creature. And taking advantage of him being on the ground, I would like to go into a frenzied rage! And I would like to whale on this piece of shit.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: At advantage, right?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Not as a-- I don't have to declare Reckless?
Matt: Correct.
Travis: Great! I will do Great Weapon Master. That and minus five is 22?
Matt: 22 hits.
Travis: Nice! Second one is 14, 28 minus-- that is 23?
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Six minus-- 21.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Nice!
Matt: All three hit.
Travis: All three hit.
Liam: Get him, Grog.
Travis: 18. Necrotic, four points. Oh god! 21. 31 for the first one.
Matt: Nice.
Travis: 33.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And the third one. 20, 30.
Matt: 30. All right, that's 64 points of damage in one round against the creature.
Laura: What?!
Matt: As you rush in and start whaling on it, you almost don't notice the proximity of it. The heat is so hot that you suffer ten points of fire damage just being that close to it. Your skin starts to burn and the edges of your beard begins to singe and curl in.
Travis: Hey, hey! That sucks! Ten points of burning damage.
Matt: Correct.
Travis: "Burning" damage.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn?
Travis: It does.
Matt: All right. With that, it goes to the large ember-roc's turn.
Travis: (laughs) Hi! (laughter)
Matt: All righty. It's going to go ahead and use an action to attempt its Inferno.
Travis: Its what?
Matt: Its Inferno. It begins to beat its wings extremely heavily. And as it does, the heated air and the flames begin to billow up from around it. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, Grog.
Travis: Do I get advantage on these when I'm raging? I do, because I have Danger Sense.
Matt: You do.
Travis: Natural 20. (cheering, air horn sounds)
Matt: All right. Oh, that's-- good thing, too, that was six, six, five, four on the d4 roll. That was nice. All right, so that is 21 points of fire damage, reduced to half. So ten.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Ten points of fire damage, again. And you are not blown back.
Travis: How's the beard doing?
Matt: It's burning a little bit, you're starting to smell the hair singeing, it's making you angry even in your-- angrier
Travis: Just like Hagrid's, with the dragon egg?
Matt: A little bit, yeah. You're like, oh god! However, you do not get pushed back, and as it's taking off with its wings, as part of the maneuver, you do get an attack of opportunity at it, if you want to take it.
Ashley: Get him.
Travis: Reckless. 21.
Matt: 40. It doesn't get all way over to them, it gets--
Ashley: Go away.
Sam: Go away.
Travis: It's a 21.
Matt: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. It swoops in the air, as you smash your axe in the air towards-- (crash offscreen) Like that. (laughter)
Matt: How much damage?
Travis: 23 with one point of necrotic.
Matt: Nice. 23. And you smack it, it shrieks in the impact, but its wings still (whoosh), it arcs over and lands on the ground, right behind Pike and Percy. You guys feel the impact.
Travis: We were just starting to talk! Come on!
Matt: All right. Top of the round now. This fellow over here, who's now been loading up the ballista, is going to go ahead and fire it at the bird.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Sam: It's our guy.
Travis: It's a bird.
Matt: That actually hits. (cheering)
Travis: Percy!
Matt: That is 12 points of piercing damage.
Laura: Good job, Percy! Good job!
Taliesin: I had a whole crew of people. I've got people.
Marisha: I got friends.
Matt: All righty. And over here, during this fray, this guy manages to destroy the last guard, dispatch him and get the rest of the net off.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: So that takes his full turn, but now that is available over there.
Marisha: He's available, yo!
Matt: These three guards, one of them dies but in the process, they do manage to hack down the rest of the wyverns, the wyvern does die.
Laura: Yay.
Matt: This wyvern does dispatch the last guard, however, and manages to take off its chain, which is currently lodged into the back of the wyvern. It pulls it forth from the wound with a spray of blood, and now the wyvern is no longer bound. So you now have two wyvern riders on the battlefield.
Travis: Oh, so much fun. Awesome.
Matt: Vex, it's your turn. You have to attack your friends.
Laura: I don't get to make a saving throw?
Matt: At the end of your turn, you do.
Laura: Fuck!
Matt: Actually, Dominate Person, I don't think you do! It's when you take damage. Let me see. Yeah.
Laura: Maybe he has to tell me who to attack.
Taliesin: It's take damage.
Laura: It's when I take damage?
Taliesin: You have to take damage, you have to complete all of your actions.
Laura: Oh, shit! I should have just fallen off the fucking roof.
Matt: That was your choice.
Taliesin: You can't do that now, though.
Matt: Nope. You are on your broom, and you look down, and the person who's closest to you of your friends is Grog. And so you're like, "Well, I've got to attack my friends." Make two shots against him.
Laura: I'm sorry, Grog.
Travis: I don't believe you.
Laura: Oh! Natural one! (laughter)
Travis: It's true!
Laura: And 20!
Travis: Oh. That's a 20-- Oh. I thought you meant natural.
Laura: No, no, no.
Matt: 20 hits. So go ahead and roll damage against Grog with one arrow. Grog, as you angrily finish slashing as the ember-roc flies overhead, one arrow hits the ground next to you. You're like, "What the hell?" And then you feel the pain right in the back of the neck as an arrow has embedded itself about two inches into your meaty goliath throat.
Laura: 15 piercing damage.
Travis: Halved to seven?
Laura: I didn't even Hunter's Mark you, Grog! I'm sorry!
Matt: Remember, you don't halve the lightning damage it deals.
Laura: I don't?
Matt: No. Because the lightning damage is different beyond the piercing. So how much is--?
Laura: Oh. It was four lightning damage.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: So, total four-- and then the other half--?
Laura: It was 11 piercing damage.
Matt: So you take five plus four, so you take nine points of damage total from that shot. All right.
Laura: Sorry.
Travis: That's okay, I'll get you later.
Matt: You're going to stand there for a moment and--
Laura: That's it? That's all I do?
Matt: I mean, you can move around if you want to. You've just got to attack your friends when it comes to your action.
Ashley: How do we get-- we have to--
Travis: Punch yourself in the face!
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: I can't. I don't know to punch myself in the face.
Travis: I'm going to punch you in the face.
Sam: Vex is working with them! Kill her. (laughter)
Sam: I knew this day would come.
Laura: I'm not aware of what I'm doing. I just think, "I need to kill my friends."
Matt: Yeah, it's an impulse. It's like, "Okay, no worries."
Laura: Okay. I'm just going to be up here! Shooting you guys!
Matt: Okay. That ends Vex's turn. Vax?
Liam: If I go four down diagonally towards the giant, I'll be within ten feet, yeah?
Matt: This way?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Three, four, five. You can get within ten feet, or you can get right up to it if you want to.
Liam: I don't want to.
Matt: Okay, so you can get within ten feet of her.
Liam: Yeah. I am going to use bonus action to cast Vow of Enmity against her.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: That sounds awesome.
Liam: With the feathers bristling in my armor. And then I'm going to use the rest of my movement to back straight back towards the wall, another two or three squares, I think.
Ashley: Dang it, you're so cool!
Liam: And I'm going to chuck-- well, we're good. We've got Bigby's Hand right in her private area. But I'm now going to throw Whisper at her back.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And I should have advantage because she's busy.
Matt: Well, advantage because she's busy--
Laura: And your vow.
Liam: Well, and the vow. Either way. It doesn't stack.
Matt: No, you have advantage on attack rolls against the creature for one minute.
Liam: Right.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: That or Bigby's.
Matt: Well, Bigby's isn't threatening, technically. So it's--
Liam: So 26 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: So four. That's the dice before I add anything. And then-- Does psychic damage get damage? It's a die. I don't know, I haven't done it.
Laura: Doubled? You double all your dice.
Liam: All your dice.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Was it a critical hit?
Liam: No. Sorry.
Matt: Yeah, you don't double the dice.
Liam: Ten, and then. Don't message me, internet. Ten, 14, 19, 'cause I don't care, 22, 27, 33, 34, 37. Plus Hunter's Mark. 38, plus my plus eight to the dagger is--
Laura: Wow.
Matt: Rogues, man.
Liam: 42.
Matt: 42. Nice.
Liam: And that's it.
Matt: 42 points of impact. Are you staying back?
Liam: I'm out of movement, aren't I?
Matt: I mean, you threw Whisper at it.
Liam: But the bonus action was for the Vow of Enmity, I believe.
Matt: Right. I'm saying, when you threw Whisper, you weren't travelling with it.
Liam: No, no, no.
Matt: Okay, good. Just making sure. That ends your turn, Vax?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. So we have a giant bird, and another giant bird, and they're all really angry at us, right?
Matt: It's one giant bird, and then angry wyverns.
Marisha: And then tiny, tiny dragons with wings. Okay. Where's the wyvern?
Matt: That's a wyvern there, and there's a wyvern over there.
Laura: There's a wyvern, and there's a wyvern.
Marisha: (singing) Kill the wyvern, kill the wyvern!
All: (singing) Kill the wyvern!
Taliesin: We're a little weird tonight.
Marisha: That happened. Yeah, we kind of are, aren't we?
Taliesin: This is a musical episode.
Matt: I will fight you, Sam.
Marisha: Man, I'm going to go ahead and cast Call Lightning, I guess?
Matt: Okay!
Marisha: And I'm going to bring it down on the wyvern that's fucking shit up next to Percy.
Matt: All righty. So dexterity saving throw to that wyvern right there?
Marisha: Yup, that's the daddy.
Matt: That is a six! That is a very failed saving throw. So that is--
Marisha: 3d10.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: That's not a great roll. Ten points of lightning damage.
Matt: Ten points of lightning damage to it. So, to the wyvern, right?
Marisha: To the wyvern.
Matt: Yeah. So the wyvern rider barely pulls out of the way as the bolt of lightning from the slowly conjured storm in the sky strikes out and slams into the back of the wyvern. You see the energy arcing through its body before it dissipates, and the wyvern shakes from the impact, looks around angrily. The rider pulls the reins and gets it refocused.
Marisha: Well, technically, doesn't Call Lightning: every creature within five feet of that point must make a dexterity saving throw?
Matt: It is every creature! Which the-- that's a natural one.
Marisha: So he also takes the ten points of damage.
Matt: Yes. So, they both get hit. While he dodges, the arcing energy actually travels through his body, grounding himself to the creature. So they both take damage.
Marisha: And then I'm going to use my bonus action to go-- let's go air elemental.
Laura: Looked like she was smelling her armpit as she did that.
Marisha: (sniffs) Pit check is good! (laughter)
Travis: Kentucky.
Matt: Perfect. (laughter)
Matt: All righty. You are now an air elemental. You can move in your elemental form. You haven't moved yet. So you can still move in your form if you want.
Marisha: Can I levitate a little? Get in the air a little bit?
Laura: It's fabulous in the air. It's really good.
Matt: You're ever-so-slightly levitating.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All right, there you go, Keyleth.
Marisha: Thanks, bruh.
Matt: All right, now it's General (inaudible)'s turn.
Travis: General what, did you say her name?
Matt: I didn't. You don't know it.
Travis: Use your consonants, Mercer!
Sam: General Grievous.
Matt: I said too much. No. That would be so hackneyed.
Taliesin: General Chaos. General Calamity?
Matt: So, after taking the blow to the chest, is going to go straight for you, Grog. You're a big old target who came forward and slammed and has dealt a crapton of damage.
Travis: Be honest, she is attracted to me as well.
Matt: Probably. As she turns with the floating hand and the floating sword, waving it by the hammer, watches as its ember-roc slams over towards Percy and Pike. Feels pretty confident, sees you, a little more of a heartier target. Points the hammer at you and says, "You will be my charge tonight!" and starts walking to you.
Laura: No, no, no.
Ashley: Get away from him. Get away from him!
Matt: See if it recharges. It does not recharge Flaming Anger, unfortunately, but will take two great maul attacks against you.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: You're my charge. Yeah, boy.
Matt: That is a 21 to hit.
Travis: It hits.
Matt: And a 23 to hit.
Travis: That hits, too.
Matt: All righty. So you take, for the first hit, 40 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half to 20.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And the second strike, not as good a roll.
Travis: Blinks with frustration.
Matt: I know. 29 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to--
Travis: 14?
Matt: 14. So brings the hammer back, right into your shoulder, and it sends you off your feet. You catch yourself from the impact of the blow as the hammer spins around and catches you in the other side, right at the solar plexus, almost knocking the wind out of you. You feel your feet skid into the dry sand and dirt beneath your feet, and a little smile curls in the corner of your face.
Travis: Ooh, Miss Piggy! That tickled. Can I use Retaliation to give her what's good for?
Matt: You've already used your reaction this round.
Travis: Oh, you're right! I did! Damn it!
Matt: Sorry.
Travis: Good call.
Matt: But next turn I'm sure you'll be able to give her what for. Percival, it's your turn. As you're standing there, the presence, the heat of this creature near you, you immediately suffer four points of fire damage just from being in the proximity of this entity.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm cool. I'm going to try and-- Okay, out of curiosity, is that little trebuchet there, is that more-or-less pointed at the wyvern right now?
Matt: More or less, you'd probably have to rotate it a little bit. There is a large crank that has to be rotated to shift its direction.
Taliesin: I'm going to-- is it possible that I can get this shot off in one round?
Matt: It is possible, if you make a strength check to get it to move to its place right now.
Taliesin: It's not like I've got a lot of options here. Like, everything's going pretty iffy as it is.
Matt: So you're ignoring the bird for now and you're going for the trebuchet against the wyvern?
Taliesin: There's honestly not a lot I can do about the bird right now.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: If I try to run from the bird, is it within striking distance of me?
Matt: You don't know.
Taliesin: Okay. Well, hardly matters. All right. Let's-- 'It Hardly Matters' is the name of the game. I'm going to see if I can get this-- I guess I'm going to make a strength check to try and--
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Taliesin: Standard strength check?
Ashley: Come on.
Laura: You can do it, Percy!
Marisha: The adrenaline kicks in! Oh!
Taliesin: Wait, wait, wait. I'm burning my Resolve.
Matt: That's saving throws.
Taliesin: Is it just saving throws? It's not--?
Matt: It's only for saving throws, not for ability checks.
Taliesin: Oh! Okay, so I'm not burning that, then. Then that does not do anything.
Matt: What did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a two. So I got a three.
Matt: Yeah. You go and grab the ratchet and it's stuck. It begins to shift a little bit. You're not sure if it's going to line up.
Taliesin: Then I'm going to jump over that thing and run into the tent, 'cause I'm goddamn useless right now.
Matt: Okay. You leap over and make your way inside the tent.
Taliesin: Now I'm going to burn an Action Surge.
Matt: As you rush away, the creature reaches out with one of its claws and rakes towards your back.
Liam: He's keeping you humble tonight.
Matt: It's going to be a 20 to hit.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: Okay. The claw streaks across your back. You feel the pain and the sudden rush of adrenaline hit you at the impact. That's going to be 14 points of slashing damage to your back.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm 64.
Ashley: 64. Okay.
Marisha: Question.
Matt: Yes?
Marisha: Are we inside the fort walls?
Matt: You're inside the outer walls. This is the actual front of the fort itself.
Marisha: We're inside the outer walls. So the ones that were trying to go through that door were trying to get through the inner walls?
Matt: Into the actual fortress itself. Yes.
Marisha: Okay. So we've gotten through one layer of wall?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: And we're trying to get through the other layer?
Laura: Well, they're trying to get through the wall.
Marisha: Everyone seems to be. Just clarifying. Continue.
Matt: Yes. Percy. You said you're taking your Action Surge?
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a bonus for a heal, so I'm going to--
Matt: Second Wind?
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a Second Wind, my only Second Wind, and take 16 points back. And then I'm going to burn my Action Surge to try and fix the Pepperbox. The Animus box.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Thankfully the difficulty is not horrible. Okay. And that's fine! Again. So the Animus is back in action--
Matt: Okay, as you duck inside, clear your mind for a second, focus, pull out your tools with your Action Surge and quickly find the one section of the barrel that had somehow sprung off and was loose. You click it back into place, look up, it spins. Functional, clear and fine.
Liam: Did he blow on it like an NES cartridge?
Matt: Yeah! (laughter)
Taliesin: Yeah! (laughter)
Taliesin: Boy! That took a lot. But I'm now hiding in that tent. I'm definitely hiding in that as far back into that tent as I could have got.
Matt: That ends your turn. (laughter)
Ashley: Right at the door. Just in case.
Marisha: It's made of polyester. It's real bad.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan. You're up.
Sam: I take a few steps towards Grog, if I can. Over to my left a little bit, just so I could get a clear shot-- Sorry, other left. So I get a clear shot on the fire giant. With Bigby's Hand, I'm going to do the Sugar Ray Leonard thing where it's going round and round and round, but before he punches, I'm going to fire a Lightning Bolt at it.
Matt: Yes, not a problem. All right. That will--
Liam: So in love!
Matt: It might singe a bit of the fur on the side of your skivvies there, Grog, but a bolt of lightning coasts right past you.
Travis: Skivvies all right. Beard not so much.
Matt: Yeah. Fair enough. This is a dexterity saving throw. That is a 17 dex save. That does not make the DC, the giant gets full damage.
Sam: 8d6.
Laura: Grog's poor ass. (laughter)
Liam: Grog, is that an extra mace over there?
Marisha: Oh, god.
Travis: Kashaw, somewhere, goes "Ah!"
Marisha: Gets a nosebleed.
Sam: 24.
Matt: 24. Okay, so you release the bolt of lightning, and then just as the lightning hits the front of the giant's chest, as it was focusing on Grog, it looks over and sees where the lightning bolt came from just as the (whack) across the chin. Go ahead and roll a--
Sam: So, the initial spell was level seven, but subsequent actions--
Matt: It maintains the level you cast it.
Sam: Really? So it's another 8d8?
Matt: Yeah, well, you have to roll to hit to see if you hit it first.
Sam: Okay. Oh yes, roll d20, right, this is a spell attack. Whiffed.
Marisha: What'd you get?
Sam: A natural one.
All: Oh no!
Matt: You watch as it swings towards the giant, staring at you, at the last minute glances out and she sees the fist and ducks back, slow-motion passes past her chin. As the jaw clenches, the teeth grinding underneath, you see the jagged broken tops of the giant teeth as the eyes (whoosh) right back to you.
Sam: Oh boy. That was less Sugar Ray Leonard and more just, like, Sugar Ray. (laughter)
Matt: I'm going to put Bigby's Hand on the other side now for that.
Sam: (singing) Every morning when I wake up. (laughter)
Ashley: Oh my god.
Matt: I almost want to give you inspiration for that. Sure. Take back your bardic inspiration for that, sure.
Sam: Oh! Great!
Matt: Scanlan, you want to stay where you are or you going to move? You still have ten more feet of movement if you want it.
Sam: I mean, she's coming for me, so I'll just back up ten feet.
Matt: All right. There you go, all right.
Taliesin: Run!
Matt: Now, darting from out from the side here, Xanthas runs out, looks over the wall, sees you floating above. "Keep attacking your friends!"
Marisha: Fucking dick. Can we take him out? He was always an asshole. Come on.
Laura: Obviously he's a bad guy. Obviously he's a bad guy now.
Ashley: Would you consider him a friend?
Marisha: He was always annoyed by us.
Laura: Oh yeah, do I like him so much now?
Matt: Oh he's great.
Laura: He's my friend?
Matt: Well, I mean-- You are considered charmed by him, so yes.
Laura: He's my friend, cool.
Matt: Yep. Seems like an ally at this point. Focusing on that, keeping you informed--
Marisha: But Vex, he never had any redeeming qualities.
Laura: I love him, he's my best friend.
Marisha: This is the first time we're hearing of this!
Laura: Xanthas is my best friend forever!
Taliesin: You don't know him like she does.
Marisha: (chuckle) They spent a lot of time together.
Matt: Okay. Is going to look down and points his finger across and a beam of reddish energy comes coursing to the ground and explodes right there in the center of this area, actually right in the center with the fire elemental, so I need Grog, Scanlan, and Keyleth to all make dexterity saving throws.
Travis: Cool!
Ashley: This guy's the worst.
Taliesin: This is technically a magic--
Matt: This is a Fireball.
Travis: (singing) Natural 20.
Marisha: Ouch, jeez, I rolled a two.
Sam: Disadvantage on ability checks, not saves.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: 11.
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: Okay, that's full damage to Keyleth and Scanlan, half damage to Grog, as this is a 5th-level Fireball.
Marisha: 5th-level Fireball?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Who did this?
Matt: Little punk over here that was on top and went down inside and came out the other side.
Marisha: Wait, is that Xanthas?
Matt: Xanthas, yeah.
Travis: Does that break his--
Matt: It's not concentration, no.
Travis: I know a lot about magic, you guys.
Matt: 33 points of fire damage to Scanlan, 33 points of damage to Keyleth in her elemental form, and 15 points of fire damage to you, Grog.
Travis: Yay.
Matt: And after firing, he ducks down to the side, and he doesn't do much 'cause he still has partial cover while he's behind the top of that wall right now.
Ashley: He sucks!
Marisha: What a doucher.
Laura: I like him, you guys, I think he's great.
Matt: That ends his turn. Pike, you're up. At the beginning of your turn, due to the proximity of the heat of the bird behind you, the giant ember-roc, you would take eight points of fire damage, but it's reduced to four because of your armor's fire resistance. So that's four points of fire damage.
Ashley: So, I have a quick question.
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: So the thing that Percy was trying to do with the trebuchet. Did it not work because it wasn't--?
Taliesin: Because I'm weak.
Ashley: You're weak, okay. I want to try and give it a go.
Matt: Okay. By the way, your sword should have attacked last round when you summoned it, so go ahead and make a spell attack with it just because I totally forgot about that.
Ashley: Ugh, what do I roll?
Matt: Just roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier. You're up next, Grog.
Ashley: Ooh, 28!
Matt: That hits! Go ahead and roll the damage for your spiritual weapon.
Ashley: 2d6?
Matt: That is 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Eight.
Matt: All right, so that's an additional eight points of damage to the giant. Okay, so, continuing your turn--
Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to try to--
Matt: Winch it? All right, so as you see Percy run off, you reach up, go ahead and make a strength check.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: You got it.
Ashley: 12.
Matt: 12? Okay, that's fine. (cheering)
Matt: You grab it and (grunts) and it takes a second, but you begin getting the winch to move around. As it does, does it begins to rotate. How far are you rotating it? Who are you aiming it towards?
Ashley: I'm going to point it right at the fire bird.
Matt: Okay. As you pull the winch around, and there's a little trigger underneath as you get it in place that's kind of holding it.
Ashley: (bink)
Matt: As Pike (bink), the trebuchet, the sudden momentum of the direct inertia to momentum, the device spins over top and lobs this large boulder within this giant sling over and slamming right towards the face of the ember-roc. That's an 18. Go ahead and roll 4d12 damage.
Sam: Heavy duty. d12s!
Matt: It's a siege weapon, man.
Laura: That's 4d12 right there.
Matt: It's meant to destroy walls.
Sam: Wow.
Ashley: 27!
Matt: 27 points of bludgeoning damage to the ember-roc's face as it slams in, the rock breaks across its skull. And its head rears back from the impact and it stumbles back a bit, shaking its head. You can see part of its beak is cracked now from the impact. Blinking its eyes and shrieking.
Marisha: Oh, Buddy.
Matt: No, it's trying to kill your friends.
Ashley: Wait, aren't we attacking him?
Matt: You can still move if you'd like, and you have your bonus action to move your sword over if you'd like.
Ashley: Okay, bonus action, is there only one charge on that thing? Can I keep doing it, or no?
Matt: Every round, it lasts for a minute.
Ashley: Okay, I guess for my bonus action I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on Percy.
Matt: Okay, for the Spiritual Weapon, just so you know--
Laura: I'll bet that's concentration.
Matt: Well no, it's not concentration. But you can choose to use your bonus action to have the sword attack, or cast a spell and the sword just does nothing.
Ashley: I guess it's not going to help you. I'm going to use the spiritual weapon.
Matt: Okay, so the bonus action is the sword toward the giant, or the bird?
Ashley: Toward the giant.
Matt: The sword swings out of the way, arcs through the air, roll another spell attack.
Ashley: 16.
Matt: 16 does not hit.
Ashley: I'm going to use Guided Strike to add ten.
Matt: Okay!
Ashley: Oh but no, I don't want to, is it too late to retract that?
Matt: If you want to.
Ashley: I wanted to use that for something bigger.
Travis: Something bigger than the fire giant?
Laura: Something bigger than the spiritual weapon.
Ashley: It's not going to do that much damage.
Taliesin: Yeah, something that does more damage than the spiritual weapon.
Matt: Yeah, I mean you don't have to, it's up to you.
Ashley: No, it's okay. I'll wait for something bigger.
Matt: Okay so the blade arcs over and slams into the armor of the giant and the giant kind of shrugs it off. No damage. You just couldn't quite impact against the creature's flesh. You still can move if you want to.
Ashley: I'm going to stay.
Matt: You're going to stay there?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. The trebuchet is expended, by the way, it would have to be loaded. And to load that thing, it takes quite a few people. Just so you're aware it's probably not going to be useful again in this battle. There are other weapons in the field.
Liam: Everybody to the trebuchet.
Marisha: All hands on deck!
Matt: Heave ho! All right, Pike, that ends your turn?
Ashley: Well, I'll move out a little bit then, I didn't know it would take so much. Towards the giant.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I don't know why!
Matt: That's about as far as you can get there.
Ashley: All right!
Matt: Staying in melee range of the creature or do you want to leave its melee range? It will get a strike at you if you do. Actually, it will not because it already stuck at Percy so you can go there, you're fine. All right, that ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I see the giant eyeing Scanlan and I'm like: I thought you said I was your charge. You are not cheating on me this early in our relationship. And I take both of my attacks at general hot fire giant's face. Reckless. Great Weapon Master.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: 30 minus five is 25!
Matt: Hits.
Travis: 26 minus five is 21?
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Awesome! 34 for the first one, with six points of necrotic. 41.
Matt: 41 points of damage on that one.
Travis: I rolled a d12 plus 13.
Matt: Oh, a straight 12 on that one? Oh, that's nasty. All right. You still have your bonus action.
Travis: I do! I would like to hit him again!
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Not that great. 21.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 26, with five points of necrotic.
Matt: 26 points of damage.
Ashley: Jeez.
Marisha: Let's take this bird down.
Matt: You did over 100 points of damage in one round of combat.
All: What?!
Ashley: That's so much, Grog.
Travis: Look, I am a one-fire-giant kind of guy. I get very upset about these things.
Matt: So with Bigby's Hand floating on one side and a glowing sword on the other, the giant focusing on Scanlan, you get angry and just release this torrent of strikes. Pulling back, from the blade you can see dark blood begin to pour from the plates and the giant is wounded, but it's grinning. And its attention swings back to you.
Travis: I told you I was worth a date.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah. That's it.
Matt: All right. The bird, who has watched Pike run past, after being slammed in the face by the trebuchet, angrily steps forward here. First let's see if it regenerates that. It does recover its inferno ability, however, it is going to unleash a bite and two claw attacks on you. That is a natural 20 on the bite.
Travis: No, Pike!
Matt: That is a 19 to hit on the first claw attack.
Ashley: No.
Matt: And that is a 23 to hit. So a bite and a claw attack. The bite is a critical, unfortunately. So as that one comes to strike you, that is 19 plus 2d8 fire damage. So you take 30 points of slashing damage.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Plus ten points of fire damage reduced to half, so five. Actually, it would have been 20, so that's ten points of fire damage.
Ashley: I have resistance to fire.
Matt: Right, it would have been 20.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: But then, because he did a melee attack on you.
Ashley: Yeah, he did a melee attack so the attacker suffers 2d6.
Matt: Is that fire damage?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: You watch as there's a burst of flame but it seems to have no affect on the creature.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: This creature is fire by nature.
Travis: Naughty by nature?
Matt: Possibly. All right, and it's going to begin flanking around you.
Laura: Damn it.
Matt: After it does its strikes it-- (stomps). That brings us to the top of the round. Now, this guy is going to spend his turn loading up and then taking another shot at the bird there. That one unfortunately goes wide. It fires and slams into the ground and a big cloud of dust and rock gets thrown into the air as the large bolt jettisons into the floor, wasted shot there. This wyvern over here is going to fly up.
Laura: And attack me!
Matt: No, he's going to go after Keyleth, the air elemental form there.
Marisha: Bring it.
Matt: This wyvern here is going to rush over to Scanlan. And these guys are going to rush in and try and aid Scanlan against this.
Marisha: Hoping to get hit. Hit me, come on, hit me!
Matt: So we have the wyvern against you, Keyleth.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Bite attack is a two! No, that is not going to hit.
Marisha: Negatory.
Matt: The stinger is going to be an 18 to hit.
Marisha: Oh yeah.
Matt: So you take 11 points of piercing damage. Are you immune to poison?
Marisha: Huh? No, I'm immune to poison. Elemental.
Matt: That's what I figured. So you just take 11 points of piercing damage from that strike.
Marisha: I'm good. I'm good.
Matt: The other wyvern is going to swing down. I forgot, the wyvern rider is going to take an attack at you.
Sam: Oh shit.
Matt: I forgot, he's on there too. He swings down with his giant club. That's going to be a 21 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You suffer nine points of bludgeoning damage from the wyvern rider. You Scanlan, the wyvern is going to strike at you with both its bite and its--
Sam: I would like to Cutting Words the first one.
Matt: Okay. You can decide whether or not to Cutting Words, I'm just giving you this because you've seen them fight. The bite is painful, the stinger is where the poison is.
Sam: I'll save it for that one.
Matt: Save it for that one, if you're going to.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: But that was a 23 to hit.
Sam: That hits.
Matt: And the stinger is a 21.
Sam: Well, I Cutting Words that one.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: So I'll sing at it  (singing) I don't want to die! Get your wings off me baby, get your wings off me baby. I don't want to die. All around the world! Only a seven.
Matt: 21 minus seven is 14.
Sam: That's my AC.
Matt: Ooh.
Liam: You're being punished for using that song.
Matt: Yeah. So you take 11 points of piercing damage for the bite. And you take 11 points of piercing damage from the stinger, and I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: No problem.
Taliesin: High.
Sam: High. Constitution?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. You manage to-- you take 12 points of poison damage.
Sam: In addition to what you already said, 11 and 11? So 12 more.
Matt: Correct. And I need you to make constitution saving throws for each of those for your concentration. You have advantage on these. Because of your Warcaster feat.
Sam: So wait, that's two concentration rolls?
Matt: Yeah, advantage on the-- you make two of them, yeah.
Sam: 17 plus something.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine. Next one with advantage.
Sam: Natural 20. Two natural 20's!
Matt: All righty, and the wyvern rider is going to take a swing at you.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Matt: That is a 22.
Sam: Yeah, it hits.
Matt: You take nine points of bludgeoning damage as it smacks you over the head with a giant club.
Ashley: Are you okay!?
Matt: I need you to make another constitution saving throw with advantage.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Because you're being hacked like crazy here.
Sam: Another natural 20.
Ashley: Shut the fuck up.
Sam: The other one was a three. Three and a 20.
Matt: There you go. Warcaster, man. Warcaster is a great feat. All right, that ends their turn, it is now Vex's turn.
Laura: Yes, can I attack my best buddy?
Liam: Who is that?
Laura: Xanthas. He's my best friend.
Matt: It's more of a telepathic thing.
Laura: Motherfuck!
Matt: You know what he's referring to.
Travis: Have you been writing his name and your name in your notebook?
Laura: With hearts around it and everything.
Matt: You are such a lawyer. No, for this you're going to keep taking shots at Grog.
Laura: Fine!
Travis: Now, there are lots of people to choose from. She doesn't have to pick the most handsome.
Laura: Hey Grog, what's your AC?
Travis: Why, what did you do?
Laura: Because I got a 26 and a 29.
Matt: Yeah, you get hit. And the first one gets sneak attack damage because technically you're working on--
Laura: You!
Liam: She just Boromir'd your ass.
Marisha: Oh no! Not Boromir!
Ashley: Oh, are we going to die?
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: Boromir was my favorite.
Ashley: Scanlan, run in the tent.
Laura: 17.
Travis: What, damage?
Laura: Piercing damage.
Matt: With the sneak attack?
Laura: Halved. Huh? Yeah, that's with the sneak attack.
Matt: Okay, so half of that it puts you at eight points of piercing damage.
Laura: And then, oh, four lightning damage.
Travis: So four total.
Laura: Oh, that's just the first attack! Oh no! I'm sorry!
Taliesin: Has no one noticed that she's doing this yet, by the way? No one has commented that she's doing this.
Travis: Well, now I'm going to catch on.
Laura: 20 on the second attack.
Matt: So ten.
Laura: So ten damage on the second plus three lightning.
Matt: Okay, so 13.
Travis: 25. I'm keeping track of this.
Laura: Oh shit.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: (singing) I'm going to go because we don't get a break because we're fighting.
Liam: And stay down!
Matt: Okay Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, I want to a little mini curve and go two squares this way and on the way I want to throw, as a bonus action, throw my Flametongue Dagger at my sister.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah, so here we go. That hits, that's a 29. So she takes a total of seven points of damage.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and mark that on her sheet for her.
Liam: Okay. Minus seven awesome points. And then I want to walk up to the back of the giantess and stab her in the calf.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: She has a small cow?
Liam: A natural 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: Wait, is that with sneak attack?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Ooh! What! What?!
Sam: It's going to be like a million points of damage.
Taliesin: You're going to carve a Christmas animal out of her.
Liam: There are no numbers as high.
Marisha: Yes. Get it. Get it! Big money, no whammies!
Sam: This is a fun game.
Marisha: This is great.
Ashley: I love Dungeons & Dragons.
Marisha: We don't know the damage on the inside yet, but this is fine.
Liam: Plus Hunter's Mark. Shit.
Matt: Which is also doubled, technically.
Liam: Yeah I know. Did I-- yes I did. I forgot just my straight-up bonus that doesn't get doubled. That is 64 points of damage.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Kill it!
Marisha: Kill it!
Liam: I want to to walk up and jab Whisper into the back of her calf and then slide it up the back of her leg, up the ass, up the small of her back as high as I can reach. Probably around the tailbone, I don't know.
Matt: Okay, as you jam it into the back of the calf, the armor plates give way to the impact of the blow. And she looks over her shoulder and tries to swing the maul out backwards. You're too low at this point as she pulls backwards, exposes further up and you just drive the blade upward. As you do you catch some sort of heavy vein as blood begins to just gout out of the wound. And you keep pushing upward, it won't go much past the thigh at this point, but she turns around and starts going unconscious from the rapid blood loss based on the wounds she's already sustained. She takes her hammer up to deliver a death blow down upon you and as she goes to reach for you, her fingers lack the strength to hold the blade and she tumbles forward. You pass to the side, sidestepping as her form slams into the dirt, knocking up dust around her on the ground. (air horn) (laughter)
Matt: Vex, I need you to go ahead and roll a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: Because I stabbed you.
Laura: Roll low, roll low! Oh, I mean roll high! Roll high! Wisdom saving throw. 15.
Matt: 15 does not make it. However, technically, and this was my fault before, you do have advantage because it is a person who is not your ally. Or they're fighting your allies.
Laura: That's even worse.
Matt: Yep, so you're still dominated. Sorry.
Liam: But at least you lost some hit points.
Laura: Yay...
Liam: Seven.
Laura: I saw.
Matt: All right. So that ends Vax's turn, Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay so, I have the wyvern in my face?
Matt: You do, yes. And the wyvern rider.
Marisha: And the wyvern rider? I'm going to do two slam attacks.
Matt: To the wyvern or the rider?
Marisha: What looks worse?
Matt: The wyvern.
Marisha: The wyvern, then.
Matt: The wyvern rider hasn't really been hurt.
Marisha: I'm going to take out the wyvern.
Matt: Okay go for it, roll two strikes.
Marisha: Okay. Okay, what am I adding? Hang on. Sorry, I'm the worst. Oh, plus five, okay so the first one is 18.
Matt: 18? Hits.
Marisha: And the second one is not as good. That's a 14.
Matt: 14 also hits.
Marisha: Really?
Matt: They don't have a high armor class.
Marisha: Aw, so they each take...
Matt: They've got a fair amount of hit points for their size, but their armor class isn't huge.
Marisha: Okay cool, so the first one is good. 13 plus five so 18 for the first hit.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And four plus three is seven plus five is 12. 12 for the second.
Matt: Gotcha. All right.
Marisha: And then I'm going to use a bonus action. I have never done this before. I'm going to use a bonus action, as a Circle of the Moon druid, to use one spell slot to heal 1d8 hit points.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Marisha: Ooh, seven! That's good!
Matt: All righty. So, as you slam the wyvern twice, whack! Whack! You can see it's being buffeted. The wings are trying to keep up from the sheer amount of wind that's swirling around it. The blows are almost knocking the rider off, and he's spent most of his round trying to hold on to it. It's looking pretty rough. It's barely keeping itself up in the air, but it's still standing in front of you.
Marisha: Awesome.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Keyleth? All right.
Marisha: I'm going to keep him locked down.
Matt: Okay. It is not the general's turn, because the general is currently dead. Percival.
Taliesin: I'm going to peek out the tent, just one step. I can see that the wyvern-- I take a look at the field and I see that--
Marisha: Sorry, sorry! Sorry, Jesus!
Taliesin: Okay, so that's happening, but I can see that we have a problem with Scanlan. So I'm going to take some shots at the creatures that are attacking Scanlan. I'm going to attack the wyvern, not the rider.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: First shot-- actually, you know what? I haven't tried this yet, and this could be fun. I'm going to try a piercing shot and see if I can hit the rider and the wyvern.
Matt: I will say that yes, you can, because they occupy the same space.
Taliesin: So, starting with the wyvern, and then-- all right. Come on, don't be an asshole. Eh, that's not terrible. 19?
Matt: 19 hits. So roll also for the--
Taliesin: Oh, for the rider? That's 25.
Matt: Also hits, so with a single shot, it shoots through the neck and actually pierces the shoulder of the rider at the same time.
Laura: That's sick.
Matt: Roll damage once, and it'll go for both of them.
Taliesin: So that's okay. That's 11 points of damage and three points of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay, so they both take a total of 14 points of damage. It hits them both. The rider is looking really messed up from the impact. It looks like it hit something on the neck and is now bleeding onto its chest. It looks a little dazed from the impact. The wyvern is hurt, wounded, and the other guards are still stabbing at it with their weapons. So it's not quite at death's door, but it's looking pretty--
Taliesin: I'm going to take another double shot at the two of them. That's a 26 to hit.
Matt: Hits, all right.
Taliesin: And then the second one, which jumped, is 30 to hit.
Matt: Okay, so roll damage and then they both take the next hit.
Taliesin: Better. 15 points of normal damage, three points of psychic damage.
Matt: So 18 total? This time, as the wyvern rears up from the damage from the first impact, the pain causing it to put its wings out and puff up, it goes through the wing and takes out the temple of the rider. The rider is immediately killed and falls off the back.
Taliesin: Which means I still have one shot left.
Matt: The wyvern is now in the process of trying to get its wings up. It's realized how badly it's hurt and is going to attempt to flee.
Taliesin: That's fine. I'm going to take one more shot. I'm going to do a sharpshooter shot at the wyvern. I'm also going to, just to be an asshole, I'm going to do a push shot at him. I'm going to do a torso push. So that's, double-checking, okay. That's fucking terrible. God damn it. Again.
Matt: Again? He's going to aim and the same mechanism-- You're having a reverse Percy day. Wow! There is balance!
Taliesin: And another ten points of psychic damage.
Liam: This is just balancing for the Thordak fight. It's all right.
Taliesin: And I've lost that grit point, because I burned that grit point on the bird. So, ow! Run back in the tent. God damn it.
Matt: All right, that finishes Percy's turn.
Taliesin: And deep into the tent. Like, halfway into the tent.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up?
Matt: Just curled up and shaking.
Sam: Okay. My Bigby's Hand is still working, right?
Matt: Yeah, you didn't break concentration.
Sam: I can move it, how far?
Matt: You can move it--
Sam: Move it up to 60 feet. Is that going to get back to me in time?
Matt: To you? Yeah. You can get it to anything in the battlefield.
Sam: I want it to do a 60-foot punch on the wyvern in front of me.
Matt: Go ahead and roll.
Travis: Hadouken!
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Tiger!
Taliesin: I did well, and then I jammed again. I've done, like, 30 points of damage to myself.
Sam: Oh wait, I have to do a spell attack first.
Laura: I've done more than that to everybody else.
Sam: No! 15.
Matt: 15 hits. Armor class is low on the wyverns.
Sam: So then, oh, it's a lot. It's already up to 26. Oh. 42.
Matt: Okay. The wyvern begins lifting up in the air, trying to escape now. It's sitting here, whipping out. The guards are backing up, afraid to get too close. You see Scanlan concentrating. As the wyvern gets about 15 feet off the ground, Bigby's Hand swoops up, grabs it, and then plants it right onto the jagged rock behind it, piercing it--
Travis: You made wyvern juice!
Matt: It weakly goes limp against the bladed rock.
Laura: Sick.
Matt: That was your bonus action. You still have your action and your movement, if you like. The two guards next to you are like, "We're at your aid, sir!"
Sam: I might need it. Flank me! We're going into battle!
Travis: "Flank me." I don't think that means what you think it means.
Sam: So I'll-- I still have an action, right?
Matt: Action and movement, yeah.
Sam: I should probably heal myself, right? Nah. I'll run toward the fight. Oh wait, there's a wyvern right there, isn't there? Ooh, I don't want them to kill me.
Marisha: There's also a wyvern on my ass.
Sam: All right, I'll attack the wyvern next to Marisha's ass. I mean, Keyleth's ass. With another Lightning Bolt.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I have one more level three spell.
Matt: All righty, so the wyvern makes a-- Not with a two, it doesn't. And for the rider. The rider does get a natural 20, so it does take half damage.
Sam: Okay. So 8d6. I got it.
Liam: What's it like looking at this shirt-mare all night?
Matt: I'm trying not to.
Liam: Hey, my eyes are up here.
Matt: It's a great exercise in focus.
Sam: 23.
Matt: I hate you so much. With that, the rider takes the impact of the Lightning Bolt and whips its head back around angrily. However, the wyvern beneath it gets blasted by the bolt of lightning and throws it back. The rider gets just enough back, and the wyvern falls to the ground, unconscious and slowly dying.
Marisha: You got that wyvern on my ass! Thanks, man!
Sam: And then I use my movement to grab both of the guards and cower behind them. Close them like a door in front of me.
Matt: Okay, so you move behind them, guarding you right there. You now have two bodyguards flanking you at that moment. All right. It is Xanthas' turn, now.
Laura: (groaning) I mean, he's so cool, but I mean, he sucks a little bit.
Marisha: He's not that cool.
Laura: No, I mean, he's really cool, you guys. He's the coolest.
Matt: He sees the giant fall, but the firebird is still in combat. There's other wyverns floating around, some being taken down in the distance from other guards. It looks like the tide of battle is shifting, now, at this point. You guys, in helping out the guys around you, both gave a morale boost and shifted the tide. You can see, the other wyverns, the lizardmen, have been for the most part dispatched within the courtyard around you. However, Xanthas, looking down and seeing the circumstance, kind of, "Uh, um, argh!" Releases his hand. This is going to be against you, Vax. This is going to be a Chain Lighting.
Liam: I will use Evasion, of course.
Laura: That's good, that's good.
Matt: That's a good call on that one. All right. Chain Lighting's a little bit of a bitch, here. Let me pull it up. There we go. Sixth level. All right, so, I need Vax, Grog, and Pike to all make dexterity saving throws.
Laura: Roll so high!
Travis: Danger Sense!
Sam: Ashley Johnson!
Laura: Ashley Jenkins!
Ashley: 15.
Liam: I didn't do too well. I only got 14.
Travis: 17.
Matt: Okay, both of you fail. What did you get?
Liam: 14.
Matt: All three of you fail.
Liam: Half damage for me.
Travis: What'd you have to roll to succeed?
Ashley: I was just going to take my turn!
Matt: I know! Well, that is 50 points.
Travis: Five zero?!
Matt: Five zero. 50 points of lightning damage to Pike, Vax, and Grog. It's a 6th-level spell, and he had a pretty damn high roll, actually.
Ashley: I hate him!
Matt: So yeah. You take half that damage.
Laura: (gasps) You're alive!
Ashley: Oh, that's true!
Laura: You're wearing your armor!
Ashley: If you're knocked unconscious by an attack or spell, a blast of healing flames surrounds you! You immediately regain five hit points and are lifted to your feet. All hostile creatures within 15 feet of you must make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Or take fire damage.
Matt: Or take fire damage, yeah. It doesn't affect the creature. You guys watch as the lightning streaks out from the top of the wall. Slams into the back of Vax, who-- You arc up, your whole body seizing at the sudden burst of electrical energy, which then bursts outward into Grog and Pike. Grog, it hits you and your muscles tense and you drop the axe for a second. You reach down and push through the pain and pick it back up. Pike, it slams into you and you watch as the light shines up around you, the smoke emanating from underneath the plate armor. You fall to the ground. There's a brief moment of silence, and then suddenly, this bright reddish-orange energy bursts out from beneath the armor, through the neck, through the sides of the plate, and you lift up about three or four feet off the ground before landing back on the ground, restored with a little bit of health. This burst of flame arcs out around you.
Travis: Jean Grey! That's amazing!
Ashley: I growl!
Matt: Xanthas then goes, "Okay!" and darts back inside.
Laura: I hate him!
Ashley: He's the worst!
Matt: All right, that brings us to Pike.
Ashley: Okay! I sound so puny with this voice! I'm going to try my tried and true pal, Guiding Bolt! I'm going to Guiding Bolt at fifth level, right in the belly of the beast.
Matt: So you're going to turn around to this giant, angry ember-roc and Guiding Bolt it into the stomach. All righty. Let's get over here for that assault. At fifth level, you said? All righty, that would be 8d6 radiant damage if you hit. You make a ranged spell attack. It is right up against you in a ranged format, so you're probably going to have to step back because it is ranged. Or it's disadvantage to hit. Up to you.
Laura: Don't take a step back, he'll hit you!
Ashley: Maybe he'll fail!
Marisha: Would he get a strike of opportunity on her?
Matt: He might. It's your call. Or take disadvantage on the strike, because it is a ranged attack.
Marisha: Wait, wait. Is it the big bird? He might have reach. It might not be out of his range.
Matt: If you're still within melee with him, you'll have to step out of melee to not get the disadvantage. In doing that, he might get an attack of opportunity on you. It's not just within five feet, it's getting out of the creature's ability.
Ashley: I'll do the disadvantage.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll twice, adding your spell attack.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies.
Ashley: Adding my spell attack? Okay. So, 14.
Matt: Okay, roll again.
Laura: No, that was with disadvantage.
Ashley: I rolled two at the same time.
Matt: Oh, with disadvantage? That does hit, actually.
Ashley: It does?
Matt: Just barely. It doesn't have a high armor.
Ashley: Ooh! Okay, so 8d6? Okay, so how many of these, (counting). Oh, these were bad rolls. Well, that's a-- (counting)
Sam: No break tonight, guys.
Matt: Nope, sorry. We've been off for two weeks.
Ashley: Do I add anything? It's just those? 22.
Matt: 22 points of radiant damage against it. As you blast it, this giant flash of divine energy bursts around it, causing this glittering beacon. The next attack against it has advantage, period. You can see the creature itself, its flames are starting to flicker. It looks angry, and it looks wounded. That end your turn, Pike? Are you going to move? Oh, you can bonus action with the sword toward it and attack it if you want. So go ahead and make another spell attack.
Ashley: Okay. Guh.
Laura: That hit, because you needed a 14.
Ashley: Oh yeah.
Matt: So, 1d8 plus five, if it's higher than what you last rolled.
Ashley: 1d8 plus five.
Matt: Grog, you're up next.
Travis: Yep.
Ashley: 11.
Matt: 11? To hit?
Ashley: No, 11 damage.
Matt: Oh, damage, sorry. 11 damage to the creature. So, as the blade arcs past, striking again, you can see another flash of divine energy. Technically that would've had advantage, I just realized, because that's the next attack against it. So roll again.
Ashley: Roll that again?
Matt: Roll the d20 again.
Laura: Oh, because if you get a critical--
Ashley: Ooh, yeah, that hits.
Matt: Okay, so it's fine. I was seeing if it was going to critical or not.
Ashley: So another? Oh, oh, sorry.
Matt: Yeah, because the Guiding Bolt gave advantage on the next attack, and the next attack was the sword. So the beacon fades. It is now Grog's turn.
Travis: Stupid big bird! I run over and I would like to hit the giant flaming piece of shit. Reckless, Great Weapon Master. All the lasagna. 31 minus five is 27.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: No, 31 minus five is 26.
Laura: It doesn't matter, it hits.
Matt: You have to roll a 14 or higher to hit.
Travis: That's good to know. That's a 17.
Matt: 17 hits. That's higher than 14.
Travis: And I'll do all three. 14.
Matt: 14 hits, yeah. So, all three hit.
Sam: Kaboom, kaboom, ka-blow.
Travis: 20, 21, 31. 31.
Matt: 31? All righty.
Travis: Eight, 21, 24, 34.
Matt: All right, 34?
Travis: Yeah. Six, 19, 21, 31.
Matt: Okay. How do you want to do this?
Travis: I hit it twice with my axe, and with the third one I pick up Pike and I use her to slice the bird open! Come on, Pikey-poo!
Matt: Wielding Pike like a two-handed gnome, you drop the axe on the first two strikes, the creature stepping backward. You jump up in the air and, getting about neck-height, you swing Pike with all your strength. Pike, you feel your jowls get pulled from the g-forces of the sheer strength of the arc. What weapon are you using in the battle?
Ashley: Oh, I'm using my Mace of Disruption.
Matt: So as the mace comes through, it slams into the side of the skull of the ember roc. Your hands go numb from the impact as the vibration shivers through your body. You watch as the beak and the side of the skull crack and cave inward. With a little (squeak) sound, it just falls over on the ground.
Ashley: Yeah! Grog, it felt like I did it!
Travis: You did do it! Monstah! Give me a growl!
Ashley: Arrr! I'm a monstah!
Marisha: That was the cutest thing!
Travis: I turn around and I look up at Vex and I say, fucking cut it out!
Laura: I say, good job! I'm going to hit you in a minute!
Ashley: Oh, that's right, we still have him and her.
Matt: All right, so we go back to the first round. The two soldiers that are guarding you are like, "What would you like, sir? Where are we going?"
Sam: Is anyone out there who wants to kill me?
Marisha: There's still the guy on the ground. Right under my face.
Sam: You two go kill that guy, I'll go somewhere else!
Matt: Okay. They both, using their full--
Liam: Just killed a pit fiend.
Matt: They get all the way up to it. They don't have a chance to attack, but they're surrounding it with their weapons drawn. They're going to probably brutalize it pretty badly next round. All right. For the purposes of this round, too, you hear a sound from up in the hallway, where Xanthas was. (pained shout) You watch as Xanthas goes flying out a few feet and lands on his back. You watch as a small, brown bit of hair races across, a giant, gleaming Holy Avenger goes across the air--
Travis: Yes! Platinum greatsword!
Laura: Who was it?! It's Kima?
Matt: It's Kima. (yelling)
Matt: She says, "Bahamut strike you down, you knife-eared son of a bitch!" The blade coming down--
Sam: Defenestrated. (laughter)
Matt: Here we go. That is a 15 to hit. That hits against his armor class. And a natural 20.
Marisha: Get it girl.
Travis: End him. End him.
Laura: Does he need to make a constitution check?
Matt: Oh, he will. It is a concentration spell. Ooh, double sixes on the first one.
Travis: Don't you wanna shoot me again?
Laura: I'm pretty sure. No, right now I definitely want to shoot you again.
Travis: Oh, okay.
Matt: 21 points of damage on the first strike. On the critical, that is 25. Oof, that's rough. So, having to make a concentration check on both on those. The first one is a 15, succeeds on the first hit. The second one does not!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: It's half damage, he rolled a ten, he needed to roll 13 or higher.
Marisha: That was on the critical, right?
Matt: Yeah, it was on the critical. So the concentration spell ends, you have control of your mind again.
Laura: Tell me it's my turn.
Matt: After that and Kima unloading on him, yes, it is.
Ashley: Yeah, get him.
Travis: How many points of damage did he take?
Matt: From that total round, with the Divine Smite from her strike, he took 62 points of damage from her.
Laura: I'm gonna fly right above him and shoot directly down onto his face.
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Matt: You coast over, looking down at him on the ground. He is prone currently, so you have disadvantage on the attacks.
Laura: (triumphant laughter) And Kima's standing next to him?
Matt: Yeah.
Matt: Disadvantage.
Laura: Oh, he's prone?
Matt: He's prone.
Laura: Why do I get disadvantage because he's prone?
Matt: It's ranged attack, so when things are on the ground, they're a little harder--
Liam: If Kima's next to him, as a rogue, does it cancel out and she gets advantage from her ally?
Matt: You don't get advantage from an ally being adjacent. You get to sneak attack them if they're adjacent.
Liam: Thanks.
Matt: No worries.
Sam: You got this.
Laura: Psh. Six-- no, 18?
Matt: Hits. His armor class isn't very high. He's a little mage dude.
Laura: 18, and the other one definitely hits. 20.
Matt: Yeah, both still hit with disadvantage.
Travis: Nice!
Matt: And you get sneak attack--
Laura: And I Hunter's Mark him because he's a fucking dick!
Matt: All right. You do get sneak attack on the first hit because Kima is adjacent to him.
Laura: Well, all right. 18. Where's my dice? 28 on the first hit!
Matt: 28 on the first hit, nice.
Ashley: He made a mistake.
Laura: 13.
Travis: He made a mistake.
Laura: 17 on the second hit.
Matt: 17 on the second hit?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Marisha: He was always an asshole! Always.
Laura: That's right. I'm gonna say, I always thought you were a dick back in Emon. Don't fuck with me! Then I shoot him straight through the face.
Matt: As he's on the ground--
Taliesin: His heart breaks before the arrow hits. (laughter)
Marisha: He always had a crush on you! (laughter)
Matt: He puts his finger up as you nock the first arrow, and he goes "Wait, I--" and the first arrow hits him in the shoulder. He's like "No, (nervous laughter) we can--" and he gets that far into the second sentence before the arrow (impact) through his face. (whimpers, trails off) And the finger goes limp as his eyes go a little dead in the face.
Liam: Slightly sad.
Laura: I turn back round and I go, sorry, Grog.
Matt: Kima looks up and you and goes, (frustrated noise) "He was mine!"
Laura: No, Kima. He was mine. (laughter)
Matt: She takes the blade and (impact) stabs him anyway. (laughter)
Matt: You see some of the wyverns, the few surviving now, are starting to scatter and head back towards Emon. It looks like the ranks have broken and the tide has definitely turned at this point. As you all begin to gather yourselves, the last lizard man on the ground over there is just being repeatedly stabbed by the guards until it's no longer moving, and bludgeoned by the air elemental that's lording over it. You begin to gather yourselves to consider the next course of action. We're going to take a quick bathroom break--
Laura: At ten o'clock, a bathroom break?
Marisha: Quick bathroom break.
Sam: We need a pause.
Matt: There's a little more in store here. We'll be back here in a minute guys, we'll see you in a sec. [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. We have returned from our break. Real fast, we had two winners. We had one winner from last week since we had no episode, so we did two this time in the chat. The winners are Super Gimpo Man, who won a flamebox elder hero vault from Wyrmwood. And we have a second winner, is Southern Dragon 22, won a purple heart dice box.
Sam: That's the one that I have.
Matt: It's that color right there, for one of the deckboxes. So Super Gimpo Man and Southern Dragon 22 congratulations, well done.
Marisha: It does grant you cock lightning, that's true. It's like a 5th-level spell.
Matt: All right, guys, so, the dust of the battle settling, the plumes of smoke slowly beginning to dissipate as the fires burn out from the previous struggle. The remaining living soldiers begin to gather their dead and wounded. And you guys begin to reconvene as allies towards the broken front doors to the outside of Fort Daxio.
Laura: I search Xanthas' body.
Matt: You search his body?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: I'll search the giant.
Marisha: Can I scavenge from the ember-roc?
Matt: Sure, if you want to.
Travis: Could I ask Pike to heal me a little bit, please?
Ashley: Oh, yeah. Where are you at?
Travis: Oh, you know, like a two-digit number.
Liam: What?
Matt: How many points do you have, Grog?
Travis: 25.
Matt: 25 hitpoints on Grog.
Sam: I got nine.
Laura: Oh no, he asked. Does that mean that something's going to happen right now?
Matt: I don't know.
Laura: We need to sleep, let's all sleep. Let's go to sleep right now.
Matt: Right now? It doesn't work that way. All right, so as you guys are looting, the giant has giant black iron plate mail on, which is very heavy, it is-- it's going to take a few hands to pull off.
Travis: Not if we tagteam.
Matt: As well as her great maul, which is also very large.
Liam: Gauche.
Matt: And about 812 gold pieces.
Liam: I'll take those.
Travis: Like so big that I couldn't even wield it?
Matt: You could hold it, but you couldn't wield it, yes. Sizewise, it's maybe about three feet taller than you, from head to pommel. And the weight of it is unwieldy for your size.
Travis: 30 points.
Ashley: I heal him 30 points with my last...
Matt: Okay. You find on Xanthas-- you find 1,098 gold pieces.
Sam: I'll take that.
Matt: You find a potion of superior healing that he didn't have a chance to use. And there appears to be a wand that is shattered.
Marisha: Take it.
Laura: I'm taking it, of course I'm taking it.
Matt: It looks like it has broken, and there's a little bit of a burn mark on the wood the wand was crafted from.
Laura: Okay. I inspect it. It doesn't do anything when I inspect it.
Matt: Okay. Make an arcana check.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Take a look, Hermione.
Laura: But I'm doing it because Grog told me to, and he's brilliant.
Travis: I know.
Laura: 11.
Liam: Check out the brain on Vex.
Matt: Definitely busted. And it was once a wand.
Laura: Cool cool cool.
Travis: Are you sure it's not a twig?
Matt: I hate you so much, Sam. Nothing, continue.
Travis: He never saw the bottom of it. Until now.
Matt: No, not until now.
Sam: Oh, is that true?
Matt: Yeah. I've been focused on... other things.
Sam: I printed some extras for you, Matt. Like, sign them for fans... it's high derp.
Matt: I blame you, internet. You're partially responsible for this. Oh boy. Some things never die.
Liam: That's a legacy.
Matt: It is a legacy, it's true. It's pretty great. One of the downsides of having hundreds of hours of video of you on the internet is those are everywhere.
Liam: We've all made awful faces and said stupid things.
Matt: It's wonderful. I'm glad you guys have come to enjoy it.
Marisha: They've all seen us pick our noses.
Matt: Probably, yeah. Somebody do a supercut, please.
Taliesin: Don't.
Matt: Too late, guys.
Taliesin: You're a horrible person. I have two guns to fix at some point.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make some repair checks while you're working on that.
Taliesin: Okay. Do I get a bonus if I'm not in the middle of combat, or is that still the same tinkering check?
Matt: Same tinkering check.
Taliesin: So number one, yes! That goes well, that's a 17. That was on Animus. And then Bad News, which is slightly easier to fix, does not fix.
Sam: Bad News.
Taliesin: Bad News is broken.
Matt: Yeah. Bad News, you're going to need supplies to fix.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to need to sit there with some money and spend some time with it.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Hey, Mom? I cleaned the dishes.
Ashley: Did we loot the giant?
Matt: Yes, the giant was looted. You're trying to carve something out of the ember-roc?
Marisha: Yes I am. Nature check?
Matt: Go ahead and make a nature check, with advantage.
Marisha: Gil, don't fuck me, Gil. Gil, god damn it, Gil. (laughter)
Marisha: But with advantage, it is a 25.
Matt: Okay. It's hard to pull a lot from the body, because the nature of the ember-roc, as it passes away, parts of it begin to turn to ash, but you do manage to pull from a portion of its torso what's called ember-roc oil. It is a flammable liquid that burns like a napalm.
Marisha: Like napalm?
Matt: You get about roughly a gallon of it to extract. Because the rest of it's ruined for it. It's worth about 750 gold, if you were to try and sell it. It's very volatile, depending on how you store it, just so you're aware.
Sam: Cool, man.
Liam: Oh man, drop some Mentos in there.
Marisha: Percy, do you have any vials left?
Taliesin: In theory, I should have some vials left.
Sam: Can it hold a gallon?
Taliesin: Not a gallon's worth.
Marisha: Not a gallon, but I just want a couple, and I hand a couple to Vex and Vax. Just a couple vials of the--
Matt: So you guys have a vial of ember-roc oil.
Marisha: Yep, nitroglycerin.
Matt: Kind of. In a way.
Marisha: You can either make a really great molotov cocktail, or maybe some flaming arrows.
Matt: You're not certain. The book that you have that details some of these creatures, the thing that you had found earlier in the campaign, it doesn't tell you details of how the actual liquid is triggered, it just says that it is fiery and burns very hot.
Travis: It's like the goo from Ghostbusters 2. "Talk angry."
Laura: "Talk sweet."
Matt: Sure. As you guys are taking this moment to figure this out, eventually you hear what sounds like the crumbling of stone, and a few rocks tumble out of the broken open entrance to the fortress, and you watch as a couple of guards begin to come out, their eyes wide. They look like they were in armor and ready to make the final stand. Among them, you see General Elle Gorgofon, the female head of this particular regiment of Fort Daxio, and Kima.
Marisha: But what about Allura?
Matt: You see them all emerge from it. Elle looks out to them. "So, you've done well. Little late, but thank you for the assist. We'll begin to gather our dead." She walks forward and gives you all a nod as she puts her helmet back on. Puts her blade aside and begins helping their soldiers begin to gather the dead in a pile. Kima steps up. You can see her teeth are clenched, and there's still a shaking of rage in her fists, and what looks to be streaks of dried tears across her cheek. "Xanthas betrayed us all. He arrived alone, bloodied, asked for aid and protection. Since Allura recognized him, we let him in. Stayed here for a short time, saying how bad things had become in Emon, and spoke with Allura alone. Something sensitive. We found her ten minutes later. Come with me."
Travis: Are you serious?
Matt: She steps over the stone and leads you inside of the fortress. She turns the corner, stops, staring into the room. As you guys approach, motions for you to follow her. You walk up to one of the small meeting chambers, the one that you met Elle with when you first arrived here. And as you begin to approach, Kima turns back and says, "It's okay. Friends are here." And you walk in and you see Allura sitting really scared in a corner in her robes, sitting in a chair with her knees pulled to her chest. Her eyes widen as she sees you all, and she gets up from her chair and runs over, and the person who's probably the first to walk in there would probably be Keyleth, at this point, and just wraps her arms around you and just holds you for a second and shakes.
Marisha: Are you okay? What happened? We thought you were dead for a second.
Matt: She backs away. (distressed sounds)
Marisha: Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What's your name? What's your name? She's been Feebleminded. I turn to Kima. Was it Feeblemind?
Matt: "I-- I don't know what that is, I don't-- Can you help her?"
Marisha: Yes. It's a restoration spell.
Ashley: Yeah. I'm going to cast a Greater Restoration on her. I have it. Can I-- well, I don't have any 5th-level left yet-- wow. I don't have any 5th-level left, but I have a seventh. Can I cast it at a seventh?
Matt: You do have a seventh.
Ashley: Yeah, can I cast it at that?
Matt: Oh, you can definitely cast it at a higher level. It doesn't affect it, but you can.
Sam: No, no, it doesn't affect the power of the spell. It doesn't make it a more powerful spell.
Ashley: This is so stressful.
Matt: It's all good. So as you approach-- Kima, as you begin to walk forward, your hands begin to glow as you reach out, your holy symbol beginning to burn with a bright whitish-orange color that mingles with the red and gold of the armor across your chest. As the glow sparks in your fingers, she goes (gasps).
Ashley: It's okay. It's okay. I'm going to help you.
Marisha: I try and calm her as best as I can to help Pike. Any assistance I can provide.
Matt: She reaches forward, slowly touches and grabs your hand, and as it does, you watch as the light transfers from your hands and gauntlets into her arms and upper sleeves. She winces from it, but you keep holding her tight, and as it passes up through, reaches her mind, her face, the glow passes through and lifts off her, like this gentle steam that lifts off her. Eyes roll back for a second and close. "You are a godsend, my dear."
Ashley: Oh, I grab her and hug her.
Matt: She pulls you in for a big hug and lifts you up off the ground for a second before-- "You're heavy now." Puts you back down.
Ashley: I just have so much armor on.
Matt: "That you do, that you do." As she pulls back, she looks at you all, and immediately, Grog and Vex, you feel yourselves pushed apart, as Kima rushes up and just grabs her around the side and says, "Don't do that again!" Holds her for a second. Allura just rubs her head and says, "I'm sorry. I should have been careful. We needed allies, I didn't know--" And Kima says, "You shut up," and she reaches up and gives her a kiss. She takes her and holds her to her chest. Allura holds her, and you hear Kima quietly sobbing for a moment, and she goes, "I-- well. It seems that things have moved a bit quicker in your absence. I think it's time to find what we have at our disposal and do what we can to finish this before it comes on us."
Laura: Did you receive any word back from the armies?
Matt: "They're about a day south of Emon. Syngorn has returned. Mikael is leading them northward. I haven't checked in. I'm sorry, I wanted-- I should have let you know. I couldn't, I didn't--"
Marisha: Allura, I'm sorry. We should have been those allies, here by your side, and we weren't, and I'm sorry.
Matt: "It seems you found what you went for. Let's hope it makes the difference."
Marisha: Yes. It seems it already has.
Laura: That's true.
Taliesin: We have something else. Where's the body?
Sam: What body?
Taliesin: We can interrogate him.
Laura: Xanthas?
Travis: Oh yeah, we can!
Marisha: I believe he's still on the wall.
Laura: Get that fucker!
Taliesin: Just because he's dead doesn't mean he doesn't have to talk to us now.
Travis: I'll go get him. I'll go get him. I go up and find the corpse of shitbag and bring it back.
Matt: At which point, Kima pushes away from Allura, her head still down. She sniffles back tears, looks up, punches her in the shoulder. Allura bumps back and rubs her shoulder. "I know." "You know." Kima turns around and walks out of the room in a little bit of a huff, her lower lip quivering. Allura now smiles for the first time since you came in. "All right. If you can, do your thing."
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: Should I put him on the ground or just hold him? I'll hold him up.
Matt: So you bring back, dragging this bloody body, leaving this trail through the Fort. There's bits of rock and rubble around, and you're like, "Oops!" Drag him over them as you go.
Travis: Whoops, sorry, ooh, that's pouring out.
Matt: All right. So that is a 3rd-level spell.
Ashley: Because of the necklace, I have one 3rd-level spell left. Because I've used three.
Matt: Okay. So this would be the one. If you had it prepared, it has to be prepared. All righty. Great.
Sam: What are we asking this guy?
Travis: How many questions do we get?
Laura: We get three questions.
Sam: What are we asking?
Matt: Can ask the corpse up to five questions.
Laura: Why are you such a dick?
Marisha: You were always mean to us. Why?
Travis: You've been working with Thordak. What are his weaknesses?
Marisha: What did he want?
Taliesin: The defenses of the city.
Matt: Just be aware of the rule, too. The corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it and it recognizes you as an enemy.
Ashley: So maybe just face it towards me?
Laura: Yeah, 'cause you're nice.
Matt: You can also discern lies, if you get a high enough insight. This is still-- this isn't free answers. This is still an interrogation.
Travis: What if we put a bag over his head?
Laura: I don't know.
Sam: Who would he trust?
Liam: Lizard-skinned man.
Laura: Oh yeah. Could you make yourself look like a lizardman?
Sam: Yeah, sure, or I could make someone who we know talk--
Liam: But you're so good with words.
Sam: No, but I mean, I'm saying-- who would he trust? I can make that person, and I can make that person talk.
Matt: Well, technically, it's Pike asking the questions, since it is her spell, so whatever questions you ask have to go through her.
Marisha: We have the Hat of Disguise. Can you give her the Hat of Disguise?
Travis: What if you made yourself one of the lizardpeople, and then you had her down and you were using her to get info for Thordak?
Taliesin: I think he'll know that he's dead.
Marisha: You think he won't care?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: So the trickery, I think it may be-- I would say it's probably either an appeal or a threat.
Laura: Let's try the appeal.
Sam: Let's build a game show set. He'll think he's on a Japanese game show. (laughter)
Marisha: Wipeout!
Laura: Let's try to make him like us.
Ashley: Let's try to make him like us. Like we were a friend, we're sad that he died.
Laura: Yeah, we'll all back out of view. Especially me.
Ashley: God, okay.
Sam: Do we know anything about his family? Because we could always play bad cop, too, and threaten his family.
Matt: You guys have not engaged him beyond a brief fuck-you-type conversation in and out.
Taliesin: I can threaten him. I can threaten him. I will threaten him if necessary, but we can try the carrot before the stick.
Sam: All right, so what are we asking? What are his weaknesses? Has Thordak had a visit from Greenie? Raishan?
Taliesin: How did they find out where we were?
Travis: Are there secret entrances into Emon?
Laura: Yeah, that's a good one!
Taliesin: What are the strengths of their army? What are their weaknesses?
Marisha: What does Thordak ultimately want?
Laura: Who does Thordak trust the most?
Taliesin: Who in the city, especially.
Laura: Yeah, who in the city does Thordak trust?
Liam: Do we want to ask him what he knows about the Clasp's activity?
Sam: We're up to 20 questions, now?
Laura: Four, we've got four!
Taliesin: Also, other questions may lead to other questions.
Laura: Okay, so that's good. Let's start with this, and then we'll see where it goes.
Matt: All right, what are you doing? Casting the spell?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: All right, so as Grog throws it on the ground, skids for a second, you begin casting the spell. As you're casting it, Kima walks up and kicks it one more time and then walks away. You finish-- it takes you-- it's a very quick action, but as you finish, you watch as the air itself seems to form this mist around the corpse, and the mist absorbs into the body. All of a sudden the jaw opens. Air fills its chest and the head leans up, the eyes still staring off into the distance, but it seems to be addressing you, Pike.
Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to walk over to him, and I'm going to put my hand on his face, and I'm going to say, my friend, I am so sorry that you've fallen in battle, but I had to bring you back to ask you some questions. I just got so nervous. (laughter)
Liam: Where's the beef?
Ashley: So we know that you've been working with Thordak and I have some questions. Has Thordak had a visit from Raishan?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Sam: (quietly) Persuasion check!
Ashley: 22.
Matt: The head creaks a little bit as it tilts upward. You can hear the unnatural puppeteering of the body trying to speak, not the spirit but the body's memory. "He's had no visits. He speaks through his crystals."
Marisha: Okay, we knew that.
Taliesin: (quietly) How did they find out where we were? How did he find Fort Daxio?
Marisha: Well he speaks to his crystals.
Taliesin: But we don't know, like--
Marisha: Well, some dickhead ratted us out.
Taliesin: Who?
Ashley: I just have a couple, or four more questions for you? (laughter)
Ashley: And then I will let you go in peace. How did you know that we were at Fort Daxio?
Matt: "Naught but two days before, maybe less, a scouting party left Emon. Saw activity at the fort. And when they checked, they saw you. And you were marked."
Travis: Can you insight check a dead person?
Laura: Yeah, can we insight check him?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: Vox Machina, I'm assuming, considering you left our--
Matt: You get the sense that might be what he's referring to, and you get the sense that long ago when you guys were high up on the broom looking out towards Emon, you missed seeing something that was possibly--
Laura: I remember that, we didn't roll high enough on perception. I rolled a 24 on insight.
Matt: Okay. So far none of the questions seem to be probing too deeply and he seems to be on the level with Pike.
Ashley: Do you know of any secret entrances into Emon?
Matt: "Secrets. Just the Traverse Junction."
Sam: Traverse Junction. We've heard of that before.
Marisha: Yeah, we have.
Matt: That's where he used to work. That's the--
Travis: The teleportation circle.
Matt: "Or the tunnels beneath. But those are where the Clasp reign dominion."
Travis: Two more.
Taliesin: Who within the city still fights-- who within the city still fights against the dragon? Who will be our allies, who can we trust?
Laura: That's a whole lot. Who within the city fights against Thordak?
Ashley: Are we looking for allies, like who doesn't--
Sam: Well we want to know who Thordak trusts and we want to know who Thordak doesn't--
Laura: We've only got two questions left.
Taliesin: Thordak doesn't trust anybody.
Marisha: Well, the Clasp is clearly working for him now.
Laura: What?
Laura: No.
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: Well he said the tunnels the Clasp "reigns dominion," so--
Taliesin: That's where they-- that's theirs.
Liam: But they might still be resisting. I mean the question-- asking this shithead who still resists within the city will answer a lot of questions.
Laura: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Ask that.
Ashley: Who still in the city resists-- I have one job! I feel so-- (laughter)
Liam: Can you understand a word coming out of my mouth?
Ashley: Computer! Who still in the city resists Thordak?
Matt: "There are a few groups. But beneath the city the resistance builds. We've tried to smoke them out but they keep moving."
Laura: (whispers) So the Clasp is still resisting.
Liam: Could be.
Laura: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: 18.
Matt: Kind of hard to read for a dead body, but seems to be legit.
Laura: On the up and up?
Ashley: We have one more question, but is there anything else?
Sam: Anything else? Allies?
Laura: Like, who does Thordak trust the most?
Taliesin: Or what does Thordak fear?
Travis: Yeah, yeah. I like that one.
Liam: Probably, probably. What about Greyskull Keep? Because there was a tunnel from Greyskull Keep into the city.
Taliesin: He might not know about that.
Ashley: He might not know about that.
Ashley: Is there anything or anyone that Thordak fears the most?
Matt: "Thordak has no fear. Thordak rules all."
Liam: Insight check.
Travis: Insight check.
Travis: One. (laughter)
Liam: Two.
Laura: Wait wait wait.
Matt: You can't all make insight checks to cover for the last person failing.
Taliesin: Four.
Laura: No, but I've been insight checking the whole damn time.
Matt: I know, I know.
Liam: But I get plus two so it's actually four, Matt, so spill his secrets.
Laura: 25.
Matt: 25. Seems to be telling the truth from what he knows. You get the sense that in a strange way, while he was an intelligent fellow, he was also kind of a sniveling patsy. And the way that Kima's talked off the cuff since this began to happen, since you began to prepare for the corpse, she seems to have a history, or at least her and Allura both have a history with him in the city, and he was basically a spineless coward.
Marisha: Well, I mean, it makes sense, to a certain point. When you have a big enough ego you don't have any more fears, I guess.
Liam: Are we done with him?
Laura: That's it.
Sam: I don't think he's going to talk anymore. We should kill him.
Matt: The spell at this point has subsided and the last bit of energy and mist that had entered the body slowly drifts out of the open mouth and nose, (gasps), and the corpse goes cold.
Liam: You guys can fill me in, in a bit. And I grab his collar and drag him outside with the rest of the bodies and start overseeing the burning of the bodies.
Matt: Okay. And there are large pyres for a lot of the lizardmen corpses and wyvern pieces, they've all been thrown. All the rest of the dead soldiers have been rounded up and have blankets and cloth, whatever's nearby, to haul them over the wall and begin to recount who fell among them.
Laura: (gasps) Can I fly up in the air and see if I can spot the boys?
Taliesin: We have the stone, you can find the boys with the stone. If you would like to use the stone to pick up the boys--
Marisha: Here. I give the stone to Vex.
Matt: Okay. You concentrate on the stone for a minute. Your form begins to shift. Your physicality begins to almost liquefy and then swirls and vanishes from view. You open your eyes, and you're in shadow. You're in shade. You're in this little nook at the side of the rock crevasse, and you hear two voices go (surprised gasp). And you look immediately to your left and you see Hunin and Kyor are both there. One of them has dropped the crystal on the ground--
Laura: Don't drop it!
Matt: "Sorry! Sorry!"
Laura: No, no. That's okay.
Matt: "It started glowing and I got scared."
Laura: I put it in my pocket. I'm just so glad you're safe.
Matt: "I'm glad you're safe too. Is everything okay?"
Laura: Everything is wonderful. Do you want to come back to the fort? All the bad guys are dead.
Matt: They both look at each other. "Okay." And Hunin takes Kyor by the hand and they both walk after you as you make your way back towards Fort Daxio.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The rest of you--
Laura: I bamf Trinket out and let them ride on Trinket.
Matt: Okay! They both climb up after an awkward five minutes of trying to convince them that it's okay. Trinket nudges them a little bit and they get up on top.
Laura: He's got a taste for the celestial blood.
Matt: They're both riding on top of him and he's proudly walking. (bear grunts)
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Babysitter Trinket.
Taliesin: I say we sleep here for the evening. We also can go through whatever materials the invading army left behind. Cannibalize them for our own. I suppose we can eat.
Marisha: I talk to Allura, I guess.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Is she there?
Matt: Yeah, she's nearby. She was helping gather the dead, and she was talking with General Elle and getting the ideas of what the next course of action is and as you approach her she turns to you and as she recognizes your approach and goes, "Looking to probably make a jaunt to Whitestone shortly and see what we've gathered on that end. I can bring everyone with me if you'd like. You can stay here if you like, but..."
Sam: We should not leave them again.
Marisha: I would feel terrible leaving everyone again after we gathered everyone. Who cast that spell on you? Feeblemind, that's very high level magic.
Matt: "It is, and it was beyond the capability of that... man. But he pulled out a small wooden trinket in front of me which shattered and sent me into my stupor."
Marisha: It was Xanthas?
Matt: "Yes."
Sam: He had that wand that shattered.
Laura: He had that wand that shattered.
Marisha: Ah.
Sam: Did anyone escape the fight to go report back to home?
Laura: There were a couple wyverns that got away. That's why I don't know if it-- whatever.
Sam: So does the plan stay the same?
Travis: I mean we can come back and stage here but we can't leave anybody here.
Laura: Say that again?
Travis: We can stage here, but we can't leave anybody here.
Taliesin: No, we can't leave anybody here. But it's interesting. If we're lucky, he's going to send more troops to attack and we can be long gone by then.
Marisha: Be long gone? What happened to using this as our base?
Laura: They know about it!
Travis: We can stage here. We can rally here. We can't leave anybody here now.
Taliesin: We can't leave anybody here. We either abandon or we rally at this point. And now that we know there are forces underneath Emon, that is good news. That is very good news.
Marisha: Was it only the wyverns and the lizardmen that attacked?
Matt: "Initially. It seemed to be some sort of a shock force. Apparently, that fire giant was their reinforcements or a general, I know not. From what you've told me, at the very least. There weren't any powerful entities here at the get go, either. I don't think it was sent as a full-scale assault more than it was, at this stage, just enough to harry and see what was here."
Marisha: Who was in contact with Xanthras? Xanthras? Xanthas? Xanthas. Who was in contact with Xanthas?
Travis: Oh my lord.
Sam: Zenith.
Marisha: Zenith. Who was in contact with Xena the Warrior Princess?
Matt: Xanthas. "None of us were in contact with him. I hadn't seen him, probably in the better part of a year."
Marisha: Then how did he know?
Taliesin: They saw us.
Sam: They said the scouts spotted us.
Laura: Yeah. They spotted us with scouts.
Travis: You had your hood up, it's okay.
Liam: What of the elves? Did I hear correctly that Syngorn has sent forces?
Matt: "As far as I know and the information I have received from Syngorn, they've taken the rest of the troops under General Mikael Daxio as well as the forces of Syngorn and they're marching towards Emon, one day out."
Liam: One day out.
Laura: (groans) Oh my god.
Taliesin: We could meet them at Emon.
Sam: Wait, what?
Taliesin: They're marching towards Emon.
Sam: No. Wait, what?
Laura: Yeah. So they're a day away.
Sam: Is that true?
Matt: "They're making their way northward, towards Daxio."
Sam: Yeah, to us.
Marisha: Oh, to Daxio.
Matt: "They're a day out from Emon, but they have to-- it's in the pathway."
Sam: That's fine.
Taliesin: We want them here.
Marisha: That's not okay.
Sam: Well, where else are we gonna meet?
Marisha: Well, if they have to go through the battleground--
Sam: They don't have to go through, they can go around it; they're not idiots.
Matt: "They will, and in doing so, it's about a four-day journey on foot for those troops to make it here to Fort Daxio."
Laura: Okay. So we have four days.
Taliesin: We don't have four days.
Travis: I would volunteer that we should head south and meet them where they are.
Sam: On the outskirts of Emon.
Travis: Yep. Better than being here, 'cause we let people get away.
Marisha: We're sitting ducks here.
Sam: So we're gonna march all the troops out of here.
Laura: All the troops, which is like, 20 people left.
Travis: You gotta reposition once you give your position away.
Matt: As you as that, Elle pulls forward, her helmet under her arm. "Last count, looks like we have 55 strong surviving."
Travis: Yeah, we're gonna march all 55.
Marisha: Out of 200 that were here?
Sam: Remember that the original plan was for Thordak to know where we were, and send Raishan to kill us.
Marisha: Where the fuck is Raishan? Where is Raishan?
Laura: Well, we sent Raishan back to Whitestone with Asum and then we left, so for all we know Raishan's there.
Marisha: Allura, you were talking about going to Whitestone.
Matt: "That was my plan, yes."
Marisha: And what were all of your goals, again?
Sam: All of your goals?
Marisha: All of Allura's goals.
Marisha: What did you want to do in Whitestone?
Matt: "That's a very broad question."
Sam: We need to meet up with Raishan. We need to find a rally point.
Ashley: Open a magic cafe.
Taliesin: 55 men in a broken citadel is not a plan. It was a plan before, it's not a plan now. These things have to change.
Liam: We've an army close to Emon. We do have to talk to Raishan, though. I think we should go to Whitestone immediately, talk to her, and figure out if there's any news with her.
Sam: She was coming back there, right?
Travis: Yeah, is that where she is?
Laura: Potentially
Liam: But be ready to move to the army from Syngorn, quickly. It might be our best shot, our only shot?
Sam: Should we march these 55 blokes to the south while we go to Whitestone? I'll stay and march the troops while you guys go back to Whitestone.
Laura: No, we need to rest!
Marisha: Okay, hang on, hang on. What time of day is it?
Matt: At this point it's probably a little later afternoon; you're maybe an hour, hour and a half from sunset.
Marisha: All right. We can gather our most elite.
Laura: It started really strong.
Marisha: I can get a decent amount of people through if we Teleport Via Plants very quickly, but not all of them.
Laura: No.
Sam: I think the 55 will be okay if we send them off into the wilderness.
Marisha: Here's the thing, 55 people walking near Emon is not very covert. And it's clear that there are scouts everywhere; Fort Daxio was off the map until we showed up. No one was watching it until we showed up.
Liam: But we are out of time.
Marisha: But we are what Thordak is watching.
Taliesin: So we have to be very careful of where we go and what we do.
Marisha: We put everyone at risk no matter where we are.
Sam: No matter what, there's not gonna be another attack on Daxio in the next 24 hours. So we can go back to Whitestone, we can spend the night here and then go back, or go back now and spend a night and then bamf right back before there's any attack.
Taliesin: Or we can send half the troops, as many as we can, tonight, stay here, and in the morning send the rest, and we can go with them.
Marisha: To where Syngorn's army is?
Laura: But we're gonna have to bring those guys back out here, right? I mean, we're gonna have to march with the 55 guys. So why send them through to Whitestone? Why not sleep tonight, deep within the fort, wake up in the morning?
Liam: They rest up, we go--
Sam: To Whitestone? Get info, come back tomorrow if we need to.
Laura: Yeah, but we need to rest now.
Travis: You can't get 55 guys in the mansion, right?
Sam: The mansion, sure.
Liam: But the mansion can't travel.
Sam: Unless we spend the night here first before going to Whitestone bright and early in the morning.
Laura: Well, maybe we should do that.
Sam: We need to rest anyway. I'm at nine hit points.
Laura: Can you use the mansion tonight?
Sam: No, I can't.
Laura: So we sleep within the fort. Deep within the fort.
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: What's left of the fort? What's undestroyed?
Matt: The fort's actually holding pretty well. Other than the front doors, which need to be repaired, and right now there isn't anything beyond just putting things in the way because of the impact of the giant. The outer wall's taken quite a bit of damage, but the fortress itself, for the most part, is standing.
Sam: We'll be okay for eight hours of sleep, and then we can go to Whitestone, ask around, come back if we need to. Let's go to sleep.
Marisha: Maybe we should have someone on watch.
Taliesin: Well, it is a fort.
Laura: We'll put the guards on watch.
Taliesin: They have a system.
Matt: General Elle says, "I can do that; don't worry. And don't make fun of my horns!"
Laura: I'm not, I'm not! I'm just saying that's the sound they'll make if they come.
Matt: "It's a very specific sound my soldiers are trained to hear."
Ashley: Of course, if you need us, you do blow that horn.
Matt: "Of course."
Ashley: 'Cause we will hear it.
Matt: "Yes you will."
Taliesin: I need to sleep.
Laura: Let's find a bedroom and lay the fuck down.
Marisha: Are we sleeping in the fort?
Ashley: Is there a room with a big fireplace in it, and we can all just have a sleepover?
Matt: If you want to, there is a hearth in one of the common-room areas.
Laura: Is there somewhere to clean up?
Matt: They do. There are a few bathrooms that can be...
Ashley: Are there hides and things, like, fluffies we can lay on?
Matt: There's nothing terribly comfortable, but there are blankets. It does get cold this far north. It's not in the winter months anymore, but just south of the Cliffkeep Mountains in this area, it does get kinda chilly, so there are blankets, there are hides, there are things to keep warm in.
Liam: I mean, you just got used as a weapon; you might want a shower.
Ashley: Ah, I like the dirt.
Laura: I'm gonna go soak.
Marisha: I'm gonna crash as soon as I find something fluffy to fall on.
Matt: Okay. All right. The rest of you guys find yourselves to rest for the evening? Okay. Those who care to, you clean up, and find rest as well. The food is meager but serviceable, and you all find yourselves an evening's rest. Unperturbed, a good nine, ten hours pass of intense sleep as you all are sore, you are all exhausted-- although you do recover your point of exhaustion, Scanlan, that's gone-- as do you, from your frenzied rage-- You all come to consciousness shortly after daybreak, I'd say; you got to bed probably right around sunset, or a little bit past sunset, so it's just starting to get the sun over the mountains. The day is yours.
Liam: Well, we said what we were gonna do; we're gonna go to Whitestone.
Laura: Then let's fucking go to Whitestone. Yep. That's what we said we were gonna do.
Liam: Kiki, set us up.
Marisha: Sure.
Sam: We have any trees here?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Allura raises her hand. "I can still take us there."
Laura: Fuck, yeah, that's right!
Matt: "That was the plan, but... I mean, it's up to you; we could find a tree, I suppose."
Laura: Okay, but I have two extra guys with us right now.
Matt: "Oh... I cannot do that, unfortunately."
Marisha: Okay, you know what? I can get us there, and Allura can get us back on the same day.
Laura: Okay, yeah.
Marisha: What are we getting at Whitestone?
Liam: We're gonna talk to Raishan.
Laura: See if Raishan's there.
Marisha: Is Raishan there?
Laura: Potentially!
Matt: "I haven't seen Raishan. We've been at the fort this entire time, waiting for your return."
Marisha: And she was getting Asum. You know what? Yeah. Let's go. All right!
Matt: All right. You find your way out to one of the slightly charred trees in the main courtyard area, you open the portal. (whoosh) as it opens, your two celestial-blooded children guide you through, as well as Kima and Allura, into Whitestone. You emerge from the Sun Tree in the morning hours there as well. The city is quiet. You can see that a lot of the guard has been gathering arms and armor just in case they were ever called to be part of this fray, and the city just seems to be on high alert. But everything is intact, Whitestone appears to be fine, and the castle looms northward from your current position. You guys make your way towards Whitestone Castle; the guards greet you and lead you inside. Within minutes, Cassandra has been summoned down and says, "Percival, thank God you've returned."
Taliesin: 'Thank God'? All right, why? What's happened?
Matt: "You're alive, that's--"
Taliesin: Oh! Yes.
Matt: "Look, the last time you left, you did not come back in the best of places! I'm just beginning to think--"
Taliesin: I just assume that everything is going to be bad news for the next-- Just assume that I'm going to assume everything is terrible every time I see you for the next two months. Yes, we're alive.
Matt: "Speaking of Asum."
Taliesin: Oh, no.
Matt: "Come."
Laura: Oh, Cassandra, are there rooms for these new guests?
Matt: "Who are these?"
Laura: They're the sweetest! This is, um... Keurig and Human. (laughter)
Matt: You're the best foster mom ever!
Laura: I have them written down somewhere, but I can't find it in my notes!
Liam: We met them at Booty, they're totally celestial--
Marisha: They're totally great, man!
Sam: Pumpkin latte...
Marisha: They can just crash on our couch for a few months.
Matt: You watch their noses scrunch a little as you entirely butcher their names.
Liam: They have, like, angel blood! (laughter)
Laura: What are their names again? I can't find it.
Matt: Hunin and Kyor.
Laura: Hunin and... Kyor?
Matt: Yes. K-Y-O-R.
Liam: Do you see all of this?
Laura: Got it. Angel babies. Writing it down.
Matt: "Yes, we can find them a room; that's fine. Not to worry."
Taliesin: We'll put them to work. They will be useful.
Matt: "Fine."
Sam: I mean, not right away. They've been slaves. Why don't we give them a day off?
Ashley: How old are they?
Matt: They're in their late teens. Mid- to late teens.
Sam: Why don't we just give them some schooling?
Laura: I guess they're about the same age as Cassandra, then, huh?
Matt: Cassandra's a little bit older. Though she doesn't act it. She acts, like, fifteen years her senior. And always has.
Taliesin: Yes. All right. Asum?
Matt: All right, you guys head upstairs with her; she leads you-- oh, no. She does not lead you upstairs. She leads you downstairs, through the tunnels, towards the ziggurat. And as she's walking along, she says, "Well. We've managed to relocate the meeting room. And it required a bit of careful discussion as to our current allies. As well, the transport was a bit awkward for Asum and his companion, and the dragon cannot maintain her usual form around the ziggurat, so just be ready."
Taliesin: I assumed.
Matt: As you guys make your way into the ziggurat chamber, you can see already there's the platform on the outside of the central area where the new situation is set. And you see there's a table, and you can already hear discussion off that way, and there are a few servants that are bringing food and drinks up there as part of the morning breakfast for those who are in their meeting. And you see there, right on the outskirts of the table, wrapped and curled up, a gargantuan green dragon with its head resting on its claws that is listening in on part of the conversation.
Laura: Oh, damn.
Liam: Hey, little guy.
Taliesin: Well, things have not been going well on our end; how about yours?
Matt: To Cassandra?
Taliesin: Well, to the room.
Matt: To the room? Okay, so as you head up to the platform, everyone pauses and looks over. Asum stands up-- you can see now, this being the real Asum-- acid-scarred across the face, just as Raishan's form arriving was, and sitting on the opposite end of Raishan, and you can see there's this very much kind of-- especially as a master of spies and information, understands the importance of, you know, strange bedfellows, given the circumstances in war, but is still not at ease and doesn't seem to keep-- always has one eye on the dragon at all times, but gives a nod. "It's good to see that you're all alive. And we have much to discuss. Please, come sit. You've met Brom before." And you look over and you can see Brom Goldhand, the same square-jawed, shorter, black unkempt hair, the cleric of Ioun that was and is part of the council. However, the skin is covered in burn scars. Like, the face, some of the features are kind of missing. All the exposed elements beyond the armor are just burned. But he stands and bows to everyone. "It is good to see you all alive." He sits down at the table, Cassandra takes a seat. Raishan has said nothing, is just watching you all as you sit down, gives a nod. Allura flanks behind you. Kima has been asked not to attend. (chuckles) Allura sits down on-- there's a few stools, whatever chairs were available were brought in here, so it's a ramshackle meeting room, given how many butts have to sit around this area.
Laura: I'll stand.
Matt: But you are all here. "So. I've been told that you were at Daxio and gathering other allies about. Please, let us know what the circumstance is from your end of things. Things are not as well from ours."
Travis: That sucks to hear.
Taliesin: Daxio was discovered and attacked prematurely.
Matt: "Wonderful."
Taliesin: A group has already-- a small strike group came and attacked the fort, did damage-- I wouldn't necessarily call it significant damage--
Laura: But wiped out a large percentage of the force there.
Taliesin: Decimated it.
Travis: 75 percent.
Liam: Grog?
Travis: I mean, whatever those words mean. (laughter)
Taliesin: Broken clock. That's a very good guess, Grog. I've completely lost my train of thought.
Travis: Approximately.
Marisha: The problem is that we've summoned many of our allies to Fort Daxio and they are currently in transit to that current location.
Matt: "But Daxio's been attacked."
Marisha: Correct.
Matt: "Then I would not recommend taking folks to Fort Daxio, especially if it's sustained damage. Well, we've been busy in Emon." The eyes glance over at Raishan. "And, well, needless to say, things have gone a bit strange. We've been working with Spireling Shenn and the Clasp, and we've been able to smuggle thousands of denizens of Emon beneath the city. Those that were not directly enslaved or gave fealty to the Cinder King out of fear and other interests we've been able to keep safe, and we've moved through the tunnels as often as possible. There are still many, many, many wyvern riders that patrol the city; the townfolk have run out of offerings and are now being sent out in slave groups to pull goods from nearby cities to bring at the feet of the dragon. We also have a rising volcanic mass rising up beneath the city that has consumed a number of the underground Clasp tunnels and has been slowly pinching off our mobility beneath the town, so our intent to hopefully find some sort of retort or vengeance and eventually take down the dragon... that clock is definitely ticking. Now. We've been keeping as best an eye on Thordak as we can. Brom, bless him and his sacrifices, has been our front man for this. And we know the creature has been shedding scales in places where jets of ever-burning flame now spark and burn the city itself. Wherever each one of these scales falls, it seems to be a beacon or source of its own white-hot fire. So the city is now a pitfall of its own right. The creature itself, the dragon, it has these jets that now burst from underneath its armor, fire that licks beyond it. It has a crest of red crystals now that begin to twist behind its horns and head, its eyes are like white-hot stars from the sky, it's... It's still dragon-like, but something more primal and elemental. (sighs) I'm not entirely certain what we're dealing with here. But Brom, you've made some headway." And Brom clears his throat. "(ahem) Myself and a few devout have been doing our best to prepare surviving warriors and guards, and mages who were ousted from the Lyceum; we have a few strike teams that have been effective in harrying the outside of his defenses, learning information we can, knocking down the guardians. Since the fire giants have arrived it's been a little more difficult, so we've been reduced to stealth missions, quick in and out. We don't have the muscle to assault head-on. Up until recently." His eyes pass over to you. "You say there are armies making their way to the city, and we have you, all the strength that you've gained and the stories I've heard from people here at Whitestone. If we're going to do something, we need to do it soon. Now, the Lyceum has fallen to those that have sworn fealty to the Cinder King, so we don't have use of those artifacts anymore. We've been trying to break through to the inner sanctum of the Cloudtop, what the dragon now calls its home, its lair. It's burrowed this deep, underground basin where it resides now. It only emerges when summoned or called to, or when it decides to make a proclamation, drawing what little bit of children or families that it sees as a fun bit of play to watch them bow and quiver in the street before asking for someone to prove their strength and their worship of himself and strike them where they stand. Some days he's angry, some days he's laughing; this dragon is completely insane, we can't really gauge. Red dragons are known for pride, and you could count on that, use it against them, but sometimes his jaws quiver as he cries and shakes and yells out laughing into the sky, a terrible laughter, one that can induce the worst of nightmares. I don't know what we're dealing with anymore. However. We did have one team, a very brave team, that provoked the dragon to leave its lair, and held it long enough for us to move past it and pierce the inside of its sanctum. Now, we passed the wards, and the pools of fire. The beast returned before we could get too far, and I lost most of my men, myself barely surviving with my life, and the scars to tell of it. But the beast is building something in that lair. Something it is guarding fiercely. And something that it will not leave. Something that I think it has come to hold more dear than the city it now presides over. If there is a key to piercing its pride, or if there is a reason to take it down, I begin to fear what it's holding below the city. Now, by the might of the Wounded Mistress of Knowledge, Ioun, in the channels in which we speak, that is all the information I have. I hope it's helped in some way." And he sits down in his chair and clutches his holy symbol.
Laura: Oh, my god.
Taliesin: This changes much.
Marisha: Yes, it does.
Liam: Dragon. You're awfully quiet. We need to act. What do you advise?
Matt: Raishan's head slowly turns towards you and the nostrils kind of, (snort). Not in an aggressive way, but in acknowledgement. The bright yellowish eyes, you can see the blackened veins that curl up past the scales, some of the scales actually splitting and pulling open what you can see would be some sort of a contagion-based wound that, while not infected, does not look positive. Raishan's lips curl up, and the voice billows forth, a low, curling growl. "Well. If the madness continues to spread, and our recent conversations confirm this, you've gathered your allies. Distraction. Attack. Confusion. Chaos, striking towards the center of the city is the best chance we have. If we have a way in, to break the Cloudtop, we can battle it there, draw it from its lair. Force it to possibly rescind within, and have our final battle there. Or, if luck is with us, finish it on the streets itself, and discover whatever it is it's keeping while it lies dead and burning in the street."
Liam: You say "we"?
Laura: You'll fight alongside us?
Matt: "What have I to gain by watching you do this yourself?"
Marisha: I imagine whatever he's building. What is he building, do you know?
Matt: "I have no idea. He lets nothing within his sanctum."
Marisha: Insight check!
Matt: Make an insight check.
Travis: Come on, high insight.
Marisha: What was that? That's okay, 23.
Matt: 23?
Sam: (gasps) Whispers... The promo link is lootcrate.com/criticalrole, promo code criticalrole for ten percent off your first month and remember, you're doing this to support the show, and to support my kid's pre-school class. And the memory of Dennis.
Laura: And Coachella.
Liam: Coachella needs capoeira classes. (laughter)
Taliesin: We should also probably tell them about Xanthas, that we did have...
Sam: Tell who about Xanthas?
Taliesin: The room.
Sam: Oh. Well, there was a guy named Xanthas, we killed him, he was a dick, what's there to tell?
Taliesin: There is worth telling, is that he had already turned and was working for the Cinder King.
Sam: Keyleth.
Taliesin: And he is now no longer with us.
Laura: Brom? Do you know Osysa? The sphinx?
Matt: Thinks for a minute. "I do not know of this sphinx. I am sorry."
Laura: There's a temple to Ioun in Vasselheim.
Matt: There is a temple to Ioun? In Vasselheim?
Laura: There is.
Matt: "That is good. Many temples have fallen and hidden through the years since our mistress was wounded."
Laura: You would have no way of contacting it?
Matt: "I can beseech my mistress for information. But short of travelling to Vasselheim which I have not been to, I cannot help you. I apologise, since the Calamity, during the struggle with Tharizdun, my mistress was grievously wounded in the struggle, and since then has been diminished. And in this time many of those that seek to lessen her hold on the world and the spread of the information and knowledge that we wish to share have then hunted and persecuted those of us that follow in her wake. So the temples have been buried or kept in distributed information through anonymous channels. Only a few of us in positions of protection can speak out so strongly. This..." Surprisingly, he turns back towards the ziggurat. "This was one such temple."
Marisha: What?
Laura: Yeah, that's right, this was a temple to Ioun, we knew that.
Marisha: Right, right, okay. So wait, Tharizdun?
Matt: "Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion."
Marisha: Is that another god?
Matt: "Yes, a very evil one. Sealed, chained away. Nothing you need to worry about. Not in the midst of this."
Taliesin: We're going to have to go to Emon.
Laura: Well, yeah.
Sam: Sure. We'll rally all the troops outside and maybe go in through the tunnels? I guess when we rally the troops we can form a more specific plan.
Taliesin: There will be several armies, we will have allies. There will be troops to create distractions, there will be troops that go into the tunnels, there will probably be a group of troops that go in to try and pierce the lair. We will create chaos.
Sam: Ooh, did the airship ever show up?
Matt: Cassandra says "Yes, the airship has been told to make its way towards Fort Daxio."
Sam: Oh that's good! Oh wait. Well, you know.
Taliesin: It could actually pick up the people there.
Sam: Sure, yeah.
Travis: Do we want to do a last trip to Vasselheim to talk to Osysa or... since we got all the Vestiges?
Sam: To do what? It's not all the Vestiges in the world?
Laura: No, all the ones she told us about.
Travis: She was like, if you get these then I will help you.
Sam: Oh really? She said that?
Laura: Did she say that?
Travis: Did she say that?
Marisha: Did she say that?
Laura: Do we remember her saying anything like that?
Matt: Well you didn't learn about the Vestiges until it was--
Laura: It was from her hubby, her boyfriend.
Matt: Yeah, Kamaljiori, it was, yeah.
Travis: Yeah, that name.
Laura: The one that said a name is earned.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Do we need to go to him?
Travis: It's a sphinx.
Laura: Was there anybody that said they would help us once we got all the Vestiges? I feel like they said that once we got all the Vestiges we'd be like extra awesome.
Sam: We are extra awesome.
Laura: Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marisha: I mean, there's some-- I feel like there's not some sort of Voltron thing considering there are more vestiges in the world.
Travis: You lack imagination.
Sam: Quick, let's try to fit all of our Vestiges together right now.
Laura: Okay, let's do it.
Sam: I just stab at Pike.
Laura: Ow ow ow ow.
Ashley: I don't feel anything.
Travis: Does anything happen when they're all touching? (laughter)
Matt: You take all the Vestiges and and smush them into a pile on the central table and all the rest of the council kind of--
Laura: Oh, it's not magic down here
Matt: --look curiously and they all gather around as you begin to place them all into the central area, kind of overlapping in almost the shape of a person who is built of Vestiges. You put them each one down, their kind of magical essence clinging with the surface of the stone table.
Laura: There's no magic down here!
Liam: I just lie down across the entire table.
Matt: All right, the sound of them impacting. They all sit there on the table.
Liam: They don't stick to my armor somehow?
Matt: No.
Travis: You gotta say a word.
Matt: Everyone's kind of standing there watching quietly as nothing happens, and then Asum goes, "All right then, um."
Sam: Maybe you should put your armor back on, Pike.
Ashley: I mean, I have underclothes.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Yeah, we had that discussion. You need things beneath the armor or it'll cut you to shit.
Ashley: Just like bareback armor.
Matt: That'd be a bad idea. You'd get pinched in all the wrong places.
Taliesin: We do have-- Well, we do have our own tunnel into the city that we can show-- Is anybody using our tunnels into the city?
Sam: The Clasp? Oh you mean our specifically? Last time I scryed there, there was someone in the keep.
Laura: Can you scry there now?
Sam: No.
Marisha: Wait, weren't they--
Laura: Oh yeah, Keyleth! Can you scry? Not down here. We have to leave the ziggurat.
Marisha: I've got the Scrying Eye.
Taliesin: If the keep is clear, that does give us access. Possibly clear access.
Laura: We could bamf into the keep.
Sam: Yeah, that just gets us inside the wall. That doesn't-- that's it.
Liam: That's not nothing.
Sam: The sewers is where we need to be.
Liam: It connects. That'll get us under the wall. What about-- What about Cashew? What about Shaun? What about Zahra?
Marisha: Cashew's kinda mad at us.
Liam: Yeah, I'm sure he is, but this the end of times.
Matt: Cassandra kind of raises her hand and goes, "Kashaw and Zahra, they are ready to go whenever you are ready."
Laura: Sweet.
Liam: Shaun?
Matt: "Shaun we've -- we're trying to decide if it is best to keep someone here to maintain the barrier, or if we are going all in on this, if we just send everyone out there and leave the city defenseless."
Sam: I think it's best to leave him here, especially since that was his plan all along, because he is a dominator of all worlds and a god among men.
Matt: Allura raises her hand and goes, "Either I or Shaun can run the barrier; you can decide. I don't mind staying back or going to the forefront. It's your choice which one of us to take."
Travis: Can Gilmore transport people like you can?
Matt: "I believe he can, yes."
Travis: I like Gilmore.
Liam: For what? For keeping him alive or taking him?
Travis: No, bringing him with. Dude, he turned that guy into a little pretzel dough ball. Just because he fucked with him.
Marisha: But Allura can teleport us back and forth.
Travis: Yeah, so can he.
Marisha: Can he?
Travis: That's what he just said.
Taliesin: Allura signed up for this fight.
Liam: Yeah, Allura, what do you want to do?
Matt: "It's interesting. I have a lot of personal history with Thordak. I feel a deep sense of responsibility for all of this that still eats away at me. And because of that a part of me really longs to be there with all of you, putting this dark and fiery chapter to rest. On the other hand, having already faced him, and having an inkling of what he is now, every part of me wants to run away. Screaming."
Liam: But you have faced him.
Matt: "I have."
Liam: And that's invaluable.
Matt: "I lost many good people in doing so."
Taliesin: And we're going to lose many more.
Matt: "Most likely. So the choice is yours, Vox Machina."
Travis: Gilmore. (laughing)
Travis: No offense. You're lovely and very strong.
Matt: You watch her audibly (sighs).
Laura: Is that relief? That was relief.
Matt: It's both. It's a lot of things. It's an emotionally conflicted exhale, but it is a relief of tension regardless.
Liam: I disagree. You fought this fucking thing before. You know him. That is invaluable. You have more experience than we do. You're wiser than us.
Marisha: Scanlan? What do you think?
Sam: I think we should decide this the way we always do.
Liam: Coin toss?
Sam: Talk about it for a long, long time. (laughter)
Matt: That's D&D, man.
Sam: Let's put it to a vote.
Liam: Experience. Experience.
Sam: A voice vote. All in favor of Gilmore, say, "Hell yeah." All in favor of Allura, say, "Ah, sure, sure." Right?
Sam: Gilmore?
Sam: Hell yeah!
Ashley: Hell yeah!
Travis: Hell yeah!
Sam: Oh, just us. Allura?
Sam: Ah, sure. (laughter)
Taliesin: Ah, sure. (laughter)
Liam: Ah, sure. (laughter)
Marisha: Ah, sure. (laughter)
Travis: But that was three and three. What'd you vote?
Ashley: I voted Gilmore.
Travis: That's four.
Liam: I don't know what would happen. So  Gilmore, Gilmore...
Travis: Four and three.
Taliesin: Gilmore doesn't want to go either.
Ashley: Neither of them want to go, but she's so scared now.
Marisha: Allura. Hang on, wait, I'm talking to her. I'm not voting; I'm talking to her. (laughter)
Sam: "Allura! I vote for Gilmore." (laughter)
Taliesin: Unless Gilmore feels like volunteering.
Marisha: Allura, I have had destiny pushed upon me since birth. What do you feel is right? Because I'm not sure what to believe anymore.
Laura: Make this decision for us!
Marisha: Make this decision for us!
Sam: Hey, let's leave it to the dice!
Matt: Allura turns to you, kind of takes the side of your head in her hands and says, "And in becoming a leader, you've been put in a position to make very difficult choices. As you grow as a leader, you'll have to make many more. This is not my choice to make."
Marisha: But in many ways you've been our leader-- (laughter)
Sam: We already voted, people! And Gilmore won!
Taliesin: No, actually, Allura won.
Matt: "Who do you choose?"
Travis: Yeah, it's four to three.
Liam: Well, then, it's covered. Then it's done.
Matt: "Keyleth."
Taliesin: All right.
Liam: Unless you do what Laura and Marisha did and do the exact opposite after the vote. Right? Come on, Allura.
Marisha: Wait, are you trying to use this as an allegory?.
Liam: No. That's just a throwback to, what episode...?
Matt: At this point, Raishan picks up and goes--
Marisha: Oh. Clarota?
Matt: "Oh, god, at the rate this is going, I think perhaps neither of them are going to make it."
Laura: Yeah. Sorry about that.
Sam: Trial by combat. (laughter)
Matt: The survivor goes to Emon!
Laura: I mean, is Gilmore strong enough?
Marisha: Yeah, is he strong enough? Is he all right?
Travis: We'll rest him up; he'll be great. Pretzel dough ball. It's gonna be amazing.
Matt: "Last I checked, he's handling the barrier, but he's a capable man. May need a bit of rest, but so did you."
Sam: Quick stop to get his parents' permission, then we're on our way.
Marisha: Allura.
Sam: Wait, what? What happened?
Liam: She's talking to her.
Marisha: Fucking god dammit, you guys. I'm not making votes here! In many ways, I feel-- (laughing)
Marisha: What?
Travis: We're taking Gilmore.
Laura: No, she's talking to her!
Liam: She's not trying to take her. She's talking about something else.
Marisha: Jesus Christ.
Matt: There are a few chuckles at the table now, as everyone is just dumbfoundedly watching you all argue over who to take for five minutes.
Liam: Vox Machina.
Matt: Vox Machina.
Marisha: In many ways, I feel we are walking down the path you've already walked. In that case, I feel it's time for new blood, and we've been with Gilmore since the beginning. We need you as an ally back here, we'll keep you on the sidelines as an oracle, and we'll take Gilmore to be by our side.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we said already.
Marisha: Look, he set me up to make the call, okay! I was trying to follow through, Jesus.
Ashley: You got it, Keyleth.
Liam: Smash cut to Gilmore saying, "No fucking way!"
Matt: "I'm not going, what are you talking about?! No! That's suicide! They make me baguettes every morning in Whitestone. I'm staying here." (laughter) Allura kind of nods and goes, "Very well. I'll send Kima as well. All the strength that we have in your direction. I'll stay here and play guardian of Whitestone, as I have for quite some time." She looks to Cassandra, looks to Raishan, everyone else, they all kind of nod and Cassandra stands up, holds her collar and-- it's interesting in moments like these that such a young girl still carries the weight of a room like this, of such giants by comparison to her and still can command attention so quickly with a subtle physicality. And then she adjusts her collar a bit and raises her chin. "And so it is. Vox Machina, we gather our forces. Put your minds together. Decide on your plan of action, your means of attack. Soon we begin the assault on Emon." And that's where we'll end our episode for tonight.
Sam: At dawn, we vote!
Marisha: I demand a recount! In Pennsylvania and Florida specifically.
Liam: You know, Gilmore won the popular vote. (laughter)
Matt: You guys, thank you very much. We're on the home stretch, it looks like.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Man. All right. You guys have a week to plan amongst yourselves what to do next time.
Marisha: Are we assuming that we're sleeping after this? Because god damn.
Ashley: We already just slept.
Marisha: That's right, because we bamfed to Whitestone. Never mind.
Matt: Correct, yes, you've only used your spell there. We will unfortunately not have a Travis Willingham next week, or Ashley Johnson.
Laura: Oh fuck. It's going to be an empty bench over here.
Matt: However, based on the gathering of allies just for this battle, we may have a guest or two. (gasps)
Sam: Gathering?
Matt: You guys are gathering all your allies.
Sam: As in, like, the Insane Clown Posse is coming?
Matt: Yeah man! The Dark Carnival's here! (laughter)
Sam: Next week on Critical Role.
Matt: Just start spraying Faygo all over you guys.
Laura: Wait, it's happening next week? We're going into battle? We don't have Travis and Ashley?
Taliesin: Shit's happening.
Liam: Dude, that city's probably like the nine circles of Hell, we're not just going to get there, fast track to Thordak.
Laura: Okay okay okay.
Travis: If you got Lin Manuel next week, I will kill you.
Laura: No, it's not, don't say-- no it's not.
Matt: I wish, I wish, that'd be great.
Travis: I'm just putting it out there, I don't want to have to kill you.
Matt: All right, cool.
Travis: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you Loot Crate, again, for being a great sponsor. Thank you guys so much for watching tonight, we'll see you Tuesday at Talks Machina, and Thursday for the continuation of this climactic downwards spiral into ancient red dragon territory.
Liam: This bullet-proof think-tank.
Matt: Yeah, what could possibly go wrong? (laughs) Anyway guys, have a wonderful week, a wonderful weekend, a wonderful evening, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: [NO AUDIO]
Sam: -- about the company itself who so kindly sponsors us and about their founder, one Ebenezer Lootacrata. Born on a silk-worm farm in Budapest in 1919, Ebenezer Lootacrata was a unique child. His siblings-- Claudrica, Piterca, Dominocos, and Bob-- would always play checkers, but Ebenezer was fascinated by the box they came in. In fact, he was obsessed with boxes. Did he wear briefs? No, boxers. He traded in his backpack for a backbox. He wouldn't eat jelly from jars. He scooped it out of a large pine jelly box. Dick-in-a-box? He invented that in 1930. And in 1937 he packed up everything that was special to him-- one shirt, one sticker, one comic book, and one toy-- placed them in a crate and set off for college. One day later, he was expelled from college because he did not own pants. But he had a vision! A revolutionary idea! Before, people had boxes and people had cool stuff, but he dared to put the cool stuff inside the boxes! He named his company "Lootacrata". In America we bastardize it as Loot Crate, but history has never been the same.
Matt: Thank you, Sam. Very informative.
Sam: And you guys should know that you should go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Promo code this week, to celebrate the arrival of Taryon Darrington to Critical Role, please use code "Tary", that's T-A-R-Y, for 10% off your first month's order. We at Loot Crate welcome Taryon Darrington and look forward to his adventures. He totally isn't the worst. Definitely not the worst character to ever appear on Critical Role. Actually, we've changed our mind. Please use the code "criticalrole". (all laugh)
Travis: Do you know how many people are going to go to their website and enter in "Taryon". They're like "What the fuck!?" "Code not received."
Marisha: It's an ARG, I know it!
Matt: Exactly.
Taliesin: It's perfect. They'll enter 'Tary' and be disappointed.
Matt: Tary's the new Sombra. (all laugh)
Marisha: My subscription went up three dollars? Aw. (all laugh)
Matt: Hey, at least it's in character.
Marisha: Worse.
Matt: Thank you, Sam. Appreciate it. All righty, so, a number of us, if the weather is with us-- as a giant storm apparently just blew into the west coast-- are intending to fly out tomorrow to Anime Milwaukee. So it'll be me and Marisha--
Travis: Wisconsin!
Matt: Yes!
Marisha: It's gonna be cold.
Matt: It's gonna be cold. With Travis, Laura, myself, and Marisha will be out there along with a bunch of other awesome guests, so hopefully we'll see you guys there very soon. Also, as far as the merch goes, apparently we're out of dice! Right? We're out of dice. Dice are gone.
Laura: We even ordered a lot this time, but we're out.
Sam: But what will the people do? What will they roll?
Laura: Well, maybe they'll roll something extra special later. I don't know.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: You speak like you know what you're talking about.
Travis: What a tease. What a tease.
Sam: You have no idea.
Laura: We do still have bracelets. We do still have pins. We do still have a few socks left. We still have shirts!
Taliesin: The Gilmore shirt is back--
Laura: We have Gilmore shirts. We have a few-- We have Strongjaw shirts! Are you wearing yours?
Travis: Nope.
Laura: No.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: There's our Critical Role logo shirt! All these shirts are still available in the store!
Liam: He's wearing it on his face. That's Strongjaw.
Laura: This is Strong-- this is a strong jaw.
Liam: Wears it every day.
Taliesin: You should work in radio.
Travis: They don't want me.
Laura: That's all I got.
Matt: No worries. Thank you, Laura. Marisha, do you want to talk about Signal Boost? I guess Amy Dallen just had her run, right?
Marisha: Yeah! Amy Dallen had her episode. It's great. This week is Eric Campbell coming up in the run. And you should go-- (airhorn noises)-- and you should go watch 'em.
Laura: We gotta stop.
Marisha: Yeah, where does that end? Once you stop-- once you pop you just don't stop-- oh god, now it's a Pringles reference. Okay, go watch Signal Boost!
Matt: (laughs) Well done!
Sam: And eat Pringles. (all laugh)
Marisha: Not boosted on the Signal Boost. But could be!
Matt: Indeed. (In Scottish accent) And there's a new thing called Wednesday Club. You want to talk about that? What's that about, Taliesin? Tell us about that!
Taliesin: For anybody who reads comic books normally, you know that Wednesdays is when comic books get released at comic book stores all across the country. And if you're a big comic book nerd-- and you had a really fun comic book store-- you would go on a Wednesday night and hang out with all the other comic book nerds and have six-week-long conversations on who would win in a fight, Superman or Thor.
Sam: Thor.
Taliesin: Superman.
Travis: Superman.
Taliesin: Actually, funny enough. You don't go to a Wednesday Club, so you--
Sam: Thor's a god.
Taliesin: Well, now you have a show to watch. So now that I don't really have time to do that any more, we thought it would be fun to just do it here with all of our comic book nerds, so Amy Dallen and Matt Key and I are going to be talking comics every Wednesday from noon to two on the Twitch stream and we're going to--
Laura: Yay!
Taliesin: Yay!
Marisha: New shows!
Taliesin: New show! The Wednesday Club, and we're going to try and make it fun to watch, and easy if you've not picked up a book in ages and you've maybe thought about getting into comics, or you had some kids and now the comic books have just turned into giant shreds of paper.
Marisha: Yeah, it's not a news show.
Taliesin: We're not talking news. We're just talking fun, cool comic book facts, and our first episode is going to be "Origin Stories" were we talk about why we got into comic books, and then starting the week after we're going to be talking about cool characters, team-ups, classic runs of books, anything and everything. It's going to be great.
Travis: Crossovers?
Taliesin: No crossovers. Never mention crossovers.
Sam: Special guests?
Taliesin: Special guests! We will have special guests and not-so-special guests-- you can come, too. So yes! Wednesday Club, we'll be talking about comic books! It's going to be great!
Laura: Yaaay!
Liam: So exciting!
Matt: Thank you, Taliesin.
Taliesin: Check us out on Wednesday.
Matt: Also, there's a game called For Honor that just came out that a couple of you assholes are in.
Liam: Oh, it's on the shelves, we've been playing it for weeks here!
Travis: Yeah!
Liam: You can play it as well if you go to your local shop or download it or get it at a store--I already said that but you can play samurais-- we have no samurais here. You can play knights-- Hey!-- or you can play Vikings-- you can use this guy!
Travis: Buuhh, Vikings!
Laura: What kind of Viking are you?
Travis: (loud belch) The male raider.
Laura: The raider.
Travis: It comes out Tuesday, February 14th on all gaming platforms.
Laura: That's yesterday.
Matt: That was two days ago.
Travis: It's Valentine's Day-- I didn't... miss... (all laugh)
Laura: Our Valentine's Day consisted of me making chili and then us going to Menchie's.
Travis: And farting a lot.
Laura: Yup!
Matt: There ya go!
Laura: It was a gooood Valentine's Day.
Taliesin: It's good chili, to be fair.
Matt: You got out of the house, though.
Travis: That's true.
Marisha: We watched Jurassic World and Suicide Squad.
Travis: You did both of those?
Marisha: We wanted to get caught up on our, like--
Matt: Bad movies.
Marisha: -- questionably bad movies.
Travis: That's a bunch of stank.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: No, we had to sit quietly for an hour afterward, just to take it all in.
Marisha: My favorite is Rick Flag just shouting exposition through Suicide Squad and that's his purpose.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Including Katana's needless arrival-- Anyway! This is not this night's game of D&D.
Taliesin: I went to Underworld and met some Critters, it was good.
Matt: That's awesome!
Marisha: Oh! That's a better Valentine's Day.
Liam: You know, honestly, you two having the time to sit down and watch two bad movies--
Travis: Here it comes.
Liam: When I don't have time to watch one good movie--
Laura: Here we go. Here we go.
Liam: -- is offensive. That is offensive to me.
Travis: You have the joy of children in your life!
Marisha: Yeah!
Laura: That's right.
Travis: The beacons of hope in life. Of future generations. (all laugh)
Marisha: You have spawn.
Laura: Gulp gulp gulp gulp!
Travis: He's so thirsty! He's just dehydrated.
Marisha: They'll be holding your hand, you know, in later years.
Liam: It will help me when I'm dying. That is true--
Taliesin: Pushing you slowly off the edge.
Matt: Yes. We're just gonna be somewhere in a forest, lost, screaming to each other, Help! So that's our future.
Liam: I guess it's time to climb this mountain and throw myself off.
Travis: That's a good way to go.
Matt: Cultural heritage of ours.
Marisha: This is my child. This's what I've accomplished.
Matt: Last but not least, quick little note, due to the current difficulties with green cards and people that are in the country who weren't born here, one of our fantastic crew members, Amandine, unfortunately is having to leave and go back to Switzerland. This is her last episode of Critical Role. She's been a tremendously amazing member of our team, and we've loved having her here, and we certainly know this is not the last we'll see of her, but this'll be her last show for awhile, so I just wanted to bring her out and say hi to the community real fast.
Travis: Aw, yeah! Come on out! (all applaud)
Matt: Come here. You've been amazing.
Amandine: Thank you.
Sam: If anyone would like to sponsor-slash-marry her, she could stay-- (all laugh)
Sam: -- and she could stay on the crew. Just a quick little marriage.
Matt: We all tried, everyone here did our best, but we're going to miss you terribly and you've been amazing.
Amandine: I will miss you too.
Marisha: I know, you've been great, man.
Laura: You're amazing.
Marisha: She's been working on Talks Machina, kicking ass.
Matt: Yeah, she's been kicking ass on set.
Sam: She's why it looks good now.
Marisha: Really, yeah.
Matt: Seriously, so, everyone send your love, give your hearts out, and yeah, we'll look forward to seeing your adventures as you progress and we'll bring you back as soon as we can. We'll find a way.
Amandine: Okay.
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: We love you!
Matt: Thank you.
Amandine: Thank you, guys.
Travis: Woo-woo!
Sam: Let's bring the show to her!
Matt: Yeah, perfect! We're coming to Switzerland!
Taliesin: I'm okay with that.
Matt: Guys. Let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode... of Critical Role. [opening credits]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. So. As we left off on the adventures of Vox Machina, you had just finished destroying the long-standing reign and terrorizing assault of the Chroma Conclave across the face of Tal'Dorei. As you finished that chapter, defeating Raishan and collecting the remnants of the necromancer's sanctum of where the final battle took place, you returned with the unfortunately fallen corpse of your friend, Scanlan Shorthalt. You succeeded in the resurrection, however upon returning from Vasselheim, Scanlan coming to consciousness, it was discovered that Scanlan was in a place in his life where he needed to take some time with his estranged and recently discovered daughter. And arguments ensued, and agreement was had that he would step away from Vox Machina to follow his own path. The group took a period to mourn, and then began to decide what their next layer of plans were, what loose ends still were held out there, and you made your way to the city of Ank'Harel on the continent of Marquet to return the right hand of Ripley, the person responsible for assassinating a member of the Scarbearers within the Debt's Respite tavern in the city. As you made your way past the bazaar towards the inn, on the outside you saw what appeared to be a large humanoid structure built of iron and metal walking on its own behind a very flashily dressed blond gentleman with goatee and a, for lack of a better term, braggartly demeanor who managed to weasel his way into the company of Vox Machina and to continue his adventures alongside theirs as his robot friend Doty continued to archive it in his book of his adventures. And that is where we left off. As you guys step into the relatively empty interior of the Debt's Respite at this hour, with this individual Taryon Darrington in tow.
Travis: Is that really his name?
Laura: That's his name.
Sam: Still his name.
Laura: Taryon Darrington.
Sam: Still his name.
Laura: We agreed to bring him along because he's paying us.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: That is an important fact.
Matt: That is a very important fact.
Travis: Oi, T-- Tar--
Sam: Friends call me Tary, Jumbo.
Travis: Tary Jumbo.
Sam: No, you're Jumbo, I'm Tary.
Travis: Jumbo-- Tar-- I'm Tary. Can you spell out your name for me on a piece of parchment?
Sam: Sure. Do you write?
Travis: Frequently.
Sam: T-A-R-Y-O-N-D-A-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N
Travis: No, no. I asked you to spell it out on a piece of parchment.
Sam: Oh, you want me to write it down.
Travis: Yeah, I'm, uh, I study handwriting.
Sam: I understand. A scholarly mind is not a thing to shirk. Doty, write out my name in the finest calligraphy and give him a page.
Matt: (writing noises) And the hand seems to pick up speed and start rapidly whipping across the page--
Travis: Whoa.
Matt: (tearing paper noise) Tears it out and presents it to you rather forcefully just over Taryon's head. And it is pretty fine calligraphy, actually. Not that you can appreciate it.
Travis: I know.
Matt: It just looks like a god damn scribble. (all laugh)
Laura: Scribbles!
Travis: Mm! Yes. Uh-huh. Thank you.
Sam: You're quite welcome, Jumbo.
Travis: Oh my god, behind you!
Sam: What, what is it?
Travis: It was nothing. I'm always looking out for this group, though. Thank you.
Sam: Are you the leader of this collection of individuals? You are the biggest.
Travis: No, I'm--
Laura: Our leader isn't with us right now.
Travis: Yeah, just the biggest.
Sam: Hm. All right. Have we already begun our mission that we're on right now?
Travis: Nope.
Sam: Oh.
Travis: We just got here and then you started talking.
Sam: You're right.
Taliesin: I'm getting drinks for everybody. I assume we've got the table at this point.
Matt: The entire establishment pretty much is full except for a couple of individuals that you remember from before who are kind of masquerading as patrons, but each, while they have their drink in front of them, they haven't touched it, and they have their hand on the side of their sword belts. At the bar, there is nobody currently manning it. And as this conversation's occurring you do see the familiar face of Treev Bonebreaker, the bronze Dragonborn who is the Scarbearer Head here within the facility, turn the corner into the room. It looks like he's wiping out what looks to be a large tankard, as he kind of like gives it a shine and looks over. "Well, look at that. It looks like they all returned. It's not often you see folks who are at least trying to stick to their word."
Laura: Well, that's us--
Travis: We've been here before?
Laura: -- promise keepers. Yes, dear.
Travis: Oh.
Taliesin: We're trying to stick to our word at the very least.
Marisha: Key word is 'try'. Mainly by avoiding death at this point.
Matt: One would recommend that.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Vax? Who has--
Laura: Grog.
Taliesin: Grog!
Laura: I believe.
Marisha: The bag of holding.
Travis: Oh god, don't point to me, I forgot we were even here.
Laura: Or maybe, unless you meant to say me and you said Vax.
Taliesin: No!
Laura: Because why would Vax have anything, I'm the one with the bag of colding.
Liam: See, actually, this is one of those instances where it sounded halfway between Vax and Vex--
Taliesin: It was not, it was a "Vax."
Liam: It could work for either of us.
Taliesin: I will definitely, I will stand behind that.
Marisha: Sure, it was like a long 'a' like a Vaaax.
Laura: Vaaax.
Liam: It's the "ae" thing.
Taliesin: It was Vax, it was not a Vex.
Sam: What's your name? I am a bit confused at what's going on here so-- (all laugh)
Sam: What's your name?
Matt: Treev. What's your name?
Sam: Taryon Darrington. You may have heard of me. Friends call me Tary.
Matt: No.
Sam: Well, you will once my book comes out.
Taliesin: I don't think that-- no.
Matt: Who's this fucker?
Laura: We don't know.
Taliesin: We don't know.
Marisha: We don't know.
Travis: Tary Jumbo.
Taliesin: He just sort of found us outside. And he had, honestly--
Laura: Just ignore him, really. How about that?
Taliesin: We're not entirely sure what happened here.
Matt: Ah, there's some fancy garb you're wearing.
Sam: Oh, yes. Quite fancy.
Matt: Good to know.
Sam: Deadly as well.
Matt: Anyway.
Laura: Grog--
Matt: He leans forward. "So what? Are you here to talk--"
Taliesin: Grog?
Matt: "-- or drink?  You here to talk?"
Laura: Shall we bust it out here or do you want to talk in private?
Matt: He does a quick scan of the room. "It's my people and you. Might as well."
Laura: Should I dig into the bag of holding?
Travis: What? I don't even remember being here!
Laura: Okay, I'm just gonna reach in the bag of holding and pull out the hand.
Matt: Okay, and you do. You find the mechanical digits of Ripley, plus some of them partially bent from the combat--
Travis: Oh!
Laura: Oh yeah!
Travis: I still don't have it, I'm trying to--
Laura: It's good.
Taliesin: We have the human hand as well. We have the mechanical hand and the human hand.
Marisha: Yeah, we took both.
Taliesin: We took both. We figured we'd have options, if I recall.
Laura: Oh, that's right, I put the regular hand-- did we?
Taliesin: We took both! We took the robot hand and the-- To be fair, I was dead at the time so I don't--
Travis: Tary, we work on very strict rules. If you fuck us, we take your hands.
Sam: You have more than one hand with you right now?
Liam: We have a lot of stuff in that bag.
Laura: You wouldn't even.
Taliesin: Huge collection.
Travis: We really don't know what's in there.
Laura: You don't want to see in there.
Marisha: Lots of body parts.
Taliesin: It's pretty gruesome.
Sam: Okay...
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: You have to ask, then--
Sam: Just tell me when to start swinging the sword.
Travis: Thought you had to-- oh, yeah! And it extends, but--
Sam: Sure.
Matt: Do you pass over the hand?
Laura: Sure!
Matt: While this is happening you kind of slam it down on the table. The giant, bronze dragonborn claw reaches out and grabs it, and rakes it forward, picks it up, and the fingers fall limp in the grasp. And he turns it around in his vision. (sniffs) "It's a strange contraption. Certainly looks like a hand."
Laura: She was a strange woman.
Matt: So you're telling me, this is the one that took out the Mistress Asharru?
Taliesin: I put the Retort Pistol on the table. She used one of these devices.
Matt: "Right, right. Very well." He takes the hand and begins scraping the pistol back with him as well.
Taliesin: The pistol was just for show. It wasn't a gift.
Matt: "All right. Well, at least the Mistress can lay at rest. I thank you for your deed." And he spins his finger in the air and one of the men at the table gets up and walks out of the room and exits through the front door behind you.
Taliesin: I won't pretend that we didn't have our own reasons for it. But we are grateful that you recognize that we respect your authority.
Matt: Takes some balls to come back here and not have anything to show for it. So, glad you got balls, all of you. Except for that one.
Laura: Giant balls. Yeah, his I'm not sure of--
Taliesin: We haven't checked his, to be fair.
Sam: They're quite-- quite lovely. (all laugh)
Matt: Well, I have called off my associates. The hunt is null and void. You're free to wander without worry.
Laura: Thank you, Treev.
Taliesin: We'll probably only be another day or two in town before we head home. Thank you. Thank you for your time.
Laura: We're out.
Travis: Did we not get anything for that?
Laura: We got our lives.
Taliesin: We got someone to remove a debt upon our heads.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: Oh.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: Could we see the debt or was it magic?
Taliesin: It was metaphorical.
Laura: Magic. Pure magic.
Taliesin: Magic. Sure.
Travis: Whoa. Glad we did that. (all laugh)
Matt: Stay for a drink?
Travis: Yes! Yes! Yes!
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: Yeah. Let the big guy play.
Marisha: Sure.
Laura: Sure.
Laura: But I wanna keep an eye out on the bar because I still don't trust our environment.
Matt: Certainly. It's been kinda low-key here for the day.
Travis: Tary, do you drink anything?
Sam: Wine, mostly, yes.
Travis: Does Dottie drink anything?
Sam: Doty.
Travis: Right.
Sam: He does not drink.
Travis: Then that's two for you. I'll have two of your strongest whatevers for blond-chin over there.
Matt: All right. Anyone else?
Taliesin: Yes, please.
Matt: "Round it is." And he goes and he gathers up a number of small mugs, tankards, it's ramshackle in here. This essentially acts as a base of operations first and a tavern a distant second, so it's barely functional really as a comparable establishment for fine drinks and atmosphere, but it works.
Taliesin: Heineken's coming, basically.
Matt: Yeah, yeah. The drinks are passed around, some small talk's made with Treev, discussing just how things have been pretty low-key since Asharru was killed and you guys last left, there hasn't been an upset. There was apparently a vision of some sort of a creature at the top of the Cerulean Palace a few days ago.
Laura: Really?
Matt: But people were wondering if that was a sighting of Devo'ssa, and some of the rather intense historians and younger believers in the myth of Devo'ssa have been up in a tizzy, and Treev just kinda shrugs it off and takes a drink and goes, "Just what we need is another bigger fucking dragon."
Taliesin: Not for a long time, one would hope.
Matt: Aye.
Taliesin: So. Tary?
Sam: Yes?
Taliesin: I have to admit, I'm curious, where did you get your friend there?
Sam: Why, I made him!
Taliesin: Did you?
Sam: Yes, I did?
Taliesin: Really? What's his power? How's he powered? What runs him? I'm just sort of curious.
Sam: I-- no offense, but I doubt you would understand the inner workings of something as complicated as this.
Taliesin: That's a very interesting thought you have there. But, still, I would be just delighted to hear your attempt to simplify it for me.
Sam: All right, I will. Are you familiar with levers? Things that move up and down?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Yes? Some of those. There's also a machine called a pulley where you can apply force and it will amplify it with a wheel and a string.
Taliesin: I think I've read about such things before, yes.
Sam: Some of those are in there. Also, an incline. It's another simple machine.
Taliesin: You didn't build it, did you?
Sam: I did build it.
Taliesin: Did you? Did you build it?
Sam: I did build it.
Taliesin: So, one would assume there's an access panel somewhere on him where one can make adjustments, or otherwise fix him if he breaks down?
Sam: Pretty fancy technological speak.
Taliesin: Thank you. Where would the access panel be?
Sam: Why do you care to know?
Taliesin: Well, just in case you're knocked unconscious by, let's say, someone sneaking up behind you and hitting you with a weapon?
Sam: Won't happen. Doty has my back. Right, Doty?
Matt: At which point Doty crams in right behind and is dwarfing Tary in size with the broad metallic shoulders and is (heavy footfalls)
Taliesin: Doty? Did he build you?
Matt: No response.
Sam: I'm a bit of a tinkerer. I can show you a few things if we have a quiet moment, not in public.
Taliesin: Can you?
Travis: Holy fuck.
Taliesin: That would be... excellent.
Sam: I look forward to the lesson.
Taliesin: I look forward to giving the lesson, yes.
Liam: I'm curious if we could uh, it was Ermergerd, right?
Sam: My name?
Liam: Ermergerd Swearengen, yeah. (all laugh)
Sam: Nope. You misheard me, Little Elf Boy, it's Taryon Darrington.
Liam: Fucking don't like this guy. I'm curious, where do you hail from? Are you from here?
Sam: Nope, not from here. Matt, we discussed this, where am I from? (all laugh)
Sam: You gave me three options.
Matt: I did.
Sam: And I was like, "hmm, I don't know what any of those--"
Travis: Hey Tary! Open up!
Liam: Ooh.
Travis: Missile snaring!
Laura: Missile snaring!
Taliesin: Gloves of Missile Snaring are currently equipped, motherfucker!
Matt: Oh, shit! (all laugh)
Marisha: That's great.
Matt: That's beautiful. Okay. Let me go look up the information that I emailed you.
Sam: I can also look it up.
Liam: Who is that guy and what is email?
Laura: Yeah?
Taliesin: Doty's got email.
Matt: You are from the city of Diastock, in the Truscan Empire of Wildmount.
Sam: What he just said.
Laura: Wildmount! You're from Wildmount.
Taliesin: Wildmount, fine.
Marisha: He's from Dias-where?
Matt: Diastock.
Marisha: Diastock.
Matt: In the Truscan Empire
Marisha: Dia--
Liam: Stark.
Marisha: --stock.
Laura: Wildmount, hm?
Marisha: Truscan?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Have you been?
Laura: I haven't been no.
Liam: No we've not been.
Sam: It's quite lovely.
Liam: Yeah?
Sam: My family has quite a reputation there and I live on a vast compound with beautiful orchards and--
Marisha: Wait! You're not related to the Briarwoods, are you?
Sam: I'm sorry, no, I don't know them.
Taliesin: He doesn't look like a Briarwood.
Laura: No.
Marisha: Have you ever heard the name Briarwood before?
Sam: I have not, I'm sorry. Is Antlers okay over here?
Laura: She's quite all right.
Sam: All right. She seems a bit drunk already or something.
Laura: She always does.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: That's true. Especially these days.
Liam: Bring back the history lesson, though. So pampered, young, everything you could ever want--
Sam: I wouldn't say pampered. All right?
Liam: Those were my words. Go on.
Travis: Huggies.
Sam: I had a normal upbringing. Private tutors, classes--
Laura: Right, as you do.
Liam: Same. Same.
Laura: Right.
Sam: I wandered through the halls of our extensive library many nights. Read many books about adventure--
Travis: Yes, keep going.
Sam: -- exploration, magic, alchemy--
Liam: Is that code for masturbating?
Sam: I mean... you know.
Taliesin: Yes, yes it is.
Marisha: Kind of sounds like your upbringing, Percy.
Taliesin: Yes, it was code for masturbating. (all laugh)
Sam: My family runs a very prosperous business, and yes, I have received some benefits from that.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Sam: But I am a self-starter in my own mind and--
Laura: Oh God!
Taliesin: (yells)
Marisha: God!
Sam: I've gone out on my own to seek my fortune--
Travis: Oh God. The universe is collapsing.
Taliesin: We've lost Liam.
Sam: -- and record my exploits.
Laura: Did you purchase that armor all on your own as well, or did Mommy and Daddy buy it for you?
Sam: I purchased it myself. With my money, that--
Liam: Bequeathed to you.
Sam: -- that I can withdraw once a month. (all laugh)
Taliesin: It is quite lovely.
Sam: But it is mine.
Laura: That's good.
Sam: It belongs to me. It's my birthright.
Travis: Tary Jumbo, do you have a most dangerous conquest in that book? That Dotty has.
Sam: Doty. I have a list of adventures that I am currently going through.
Laura: (quietly) He's such an ass.
Sam: Some of the adventures include  Rescue a maiden--
Travis: Just any maiden?
Marisha: Oh jeez.
Sam: Transport a treasure. Escort a muckety-muck. A revenge plot. A classic dungeon crawl. Oh, this one I'm looking forward to! Solving a mysterious riddle.
Laura: Ooh!
Sam: The old fashioned double-cross. Teleport, haven't done that yet.
Laura: Really?
Sam: Shopping mission, but really I can wait on that one. (all laugh)
Sam: Slay a dragon. And there's more, but the list is extensive and I'd like to conquer various beasts, rescue different people, find different treasures. It's going to be quite an adventure.
Travis: Shopping is not what it's cracked up to be. You should just wipe it off the list right now.
Sam: Shopping?
Travis: While we're watching.
Sam: It's low on the list. It's a low one.
Travis: You can just erase it. You'll be fine.
Sam: All right, I will.
Laura: It's funny, that whole list... it seems like we've done all of it.
Marisha: I know.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Have you?
Travis: Several times.
Taliesin: Oh yes. How many dragons now?
Liam: Lost count.
Travis: Hard to count.
Laura: Five? Six? Something like that.
Sam: You haven't really, have you?
Liam: Yeah, we have.
Sam: An actual dragon?
Taliesin: Several of them.
Liam: Multiple dragons.
Laura: Ancient dragons
Travis: Dragons.
Sam: What was it like?
Laura: Deadly.
Marisha: Tary, do you feel like we look healthy and sane to you?
Sam: I mean--
Taliesin: Don't hold back.
Marisha: It's fine, you can be honest.
Sam: Healthy AND sane?
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: You seem healthy. You certainly are decked out in adventuring gear, which is quite attractive. Sanity I can't be a good judge of yet, I just met you. You seem like lovely creatures.
Liam: How old are you, exactly?
Sam: I'm a young 28.
Liam: You and I are the same age.
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: It's weird, you look older, but you act younger.
Sam: Oh, that is strange. Youthful exuberance, I suppose.
Laura: I suppose.
Sam: (hearty laugh)
Marisha: So, what do you hope to accomplish at the end of completing all these tasks, you know, slaying a dragon? What do you want in the other end?
Sam: The other end will be my masterpiece, my book. Doty has been very, very good about taking down all of my adventures and exploits, and at the end of it all... I know we just met, but may I share with you some of my working titles?
Travis: Please.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: Oh, please.
Laura: I would love to hear.
Travis: Hold on. Wait, one more!
Taliesin: Another round, I've got it, I've got it.
Matt: Treev's already on it. Treev is like, "Oh, don't worry. I'm loving this." Then he's just pouring all of you glasses and shoving them forward to you guys and crossing his arms.
Travis: Maybe some meats too, if you have any. Or cheeses.
Matt: We ain't got meat.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: I want to keep an eye-- I'm keeping an eye out for any kind of questionable behavior.
Matt: All right, perception check. Go ahead.
Laura: (quietly) God damn it.
Taliesin: That's a huge die you just rolled.
Laura: I know, right?
Travis: It's a newbie, it's a newbie.
Laura: 17.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Continue.
Travis: Which is why it screwed you.
Sam: Maybe you fellows could help me pick a title. Here's what I have so far.
Laura: I thought we already did, the Daring Adventures of--
Taliesin: We talked about it briefly.
Sam: That was a good one, but I have some other ones.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Tarry On with Taryon Darrington. The Terrific and Terrifying Tales of Daring Taryon Darrington--
Taliesin: That's pretty good.
Liam: That is all right.
Sam: Fifty Shades of Tary. (all laugh)
Sam: Bravado! The T. Darrington Story.
Laura: That one seems appropriate.
Sam: Zen and the Art of Robot Manservant Repair.
Liam: No. No. Thumbs down.
Sam: Adventuring for Dummies.
Taliesin: I feel like that's been done.
Sam: The Things They Tarried.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: The Blond Hair of Courage. (all laugh)
Sam: The Adventures of Huckle-Tary Finn. (all laugh)
Sam: The Odyssey.
Marisha: Oh.
Laura: Classic.
Travis: What? No!
Taliesin: Seen it.
Sam: Tary's Daring Do's and Daring Do-Nots. Dungeons and Darringtons.
Laura: Oh, wow.
Travis: Oh my god.
Sam: And this one just popped into my head Critical Patrol. (all laugh)
Liam: I grab my sister by the arm, and I drag her off the the side. What-- Why are we doing this exactly? Why are we bringing him with us, exactly?
Marisha: Keyleth just gets a nosebleed, and she's not sure why.
Laura: His money.
Liam: You think he can pay 50k an hour for realsies?
Laura: Hey, Tary.
Sam: Hm? Oi.
Laura: How much money do you have in your account right now?
Sam: In my account?
Laura: In your account.
Sam: I would not care to say. We're in a public place.
Laura: You can whisper it in my ear.
Sam: (whispers) I would not care to say.
Laura: Here's what I need to know. Are you full of shit and you don't actually have any money, or do you have enough to pay our fee?
Sam: Does this helmet look like it's something that didn't cost a shit ton of money?
Laura: It looks like it did, but for all I know you spent all your money on it.
Sam: All right, well, if you don't want the money, we can break the contract right now, and I'll go my way.
Laura: How about you just show me some money, and that way we can be sure.
Sam: All right, I will. Come with me over to the corner.
Laura: All right.
Travis: That's where the good stuff happens.
Taliesin: That was a nice little Jerry Maguire there, especially considering the date. Very appropriate.
Travis: Tavern corner.
Sam: Are we away from--?
Matt: You guys have stepped away from the rest of the crowd, as you guys watch--
Taliesin: I am watching this--
Marisha: Oh yeah.
Matt: Tary kind of puts his arm on her shoulder--
Laura: Don't touch me.
Matt: Leads her over to the corner.
Laura: Don't touch me.
Sam: I'll reach into my Bag of Holding
Travis: (gasps)
Sam: And pull up just a handful of coin.
Matt: A nice fistful of pristine platinum pieces in his grip.
Laura: Just a whole bag of that? I want to look at one.
Travis: Yeah, insight check that money.
Sam: Ding!
Laura: Don't. Flick. Money at me. Dear. If you want to keep your hands.
Sam: I'm sorry, Little--
Laura: Is this--?
Matt: You hear the scratching sound of quill on parchment as Doty has arrived behind you and is now currently cataloguing the entire conversation. (all laugh)
Laura: Does it look real?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Travis: Fucking roll high.
Laura: I'm gonna use my gold dice for this. It makes sense.
Liam: Oh, that was not good.
Laura: Ah, fuckin' A.
Taliesin: Yellow and black!
Travis: That's not the cup of a carpenter.
Laura: That's only 15.
Matt: Okay. You've seen quite a few gold, platinum pieces in your time. This seems fairly legit.
Laura: All right.
Matt: It seems like it's been minted recently, relative in the past maybe ten or so years. It has not seen a lot of antiquing across its surface, and most of the coin is branded in a way that emanates from the Truscan Empire. It does appear to have Wildmount origin.
Laura: Lovely. I believe you. Congratulations on being born into privilege.
Sam: Yes, well, I didn't choose to be, and I am trying to lead my life honest and true, humble and brave, every day of my life. And I thank you for allowing me to travel with you, and perhaps go on a mission? I mean, is this mission going to start at some point?
Laura: It was just completed, didn't you notice?
Sam: I'm sorry?
Laura: It happened right under your eyes. Mysterious, isn't it?  And I walk away.
Marisha: It's true, she's actually very correct.
Travis: Hey, Percy.
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: We're not near them, right?
Taliesin: No.
Travis: Hey, hey. Remember when we were at Greyskull Keep, and we made all the guards, like, audition to be guards?
Taliesin: Yes, that was quite a while ago.
Travis: What if we have an audition for Tary Jumbo?
Taliesin: It's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Travis: I love it when I do that, right?
Taliesin: I know, it's quite good. Let's finish up our business here.
Travis: We have business here?
Taliesin: Well, I think we should--
Marisha: Does anyone not understand, we had a mission here that we just completed?
Laura: We just did it! We completed it!
Marisha: We just did it!
Taliesin: We were also going to go to the Cerulean Tower and have a quick conversation.
Laura: Yeah, no. We need to do that.
Taliesin: We need to do that. But we did just finish a mission.
Marisha: Wait, J'mon?
Taliesin: Yes, we have to talk to--
Marisha: I am not taking him to J'mon.
Liam: That's probably wise.
Travis: You know, I can stand outside with him.
Marisha: We're like specially, you know, trained. And proven ourselves warriors. We got permission to see--
Travis: How about I audition him outside, while you go have your convo? Like, we make him beat somebody up or something.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Audition who? What are you talking about?
Travis: I'm saying we should, like, initiate Ole Tary J.
Taliesin: Like we did back at Greyskull.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: If that's what the letter that second word starts with.
Laura: (laughs) Yeah, right.
Marisha: You did good, Grog.
Laura: Impressive.
Travis: Yup.
Marisha: Good job.
Laura: I thought you only learned Gs.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Tary G.
Taliesin: Our business concluded, we actually have some business at the Cerulean Tower, so we should all, perhaps, head there at this point.
Sam: I... not to be a pest, but--
Taliesin: Too late, but yes?
Sam: I paid for adventure.
Taliesin: Oh, we're heading-- there will be adventure.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: You didn't actually pay for anything. You haven't paid.
Sam: I understand.
Liam: And we also didn't offer access to every contact and person that we know on this globe, all right?
Sam: Understood.
Liam: You're a tag-along.
Sam: And happy to be one.
Travis: Plus, these are several, subtle steps. We don't just chuck you in the furnace right away. We've got to temper you a bit.
Sam: Yeah. That makes total sense.
Travis: Cool.
Marisha: Besides, things just seem to happen around us.
Taliesin: Inevitably.
Marisha: So if you just hang out long enough, I'm sure someone's gonna want to beat our ass over something.
Laura: Like, most boring day ever now that Tary's here, we don't do anything fun at all.
Travis: Set up a craft fair.
Taliesin: Critical Craft Fair.
Laura: We all sit down and start knitting.
Travis: I will kill myself.
Marisha: Go to the post office. Check our P.O. box.
Laura: (laughs) Do some grocery shopping.
Taliesin: Laundry.
Liam: VM Accounting.
Taliesin: Magazines.
Matt: If only.
Taliesin: So, yes. We would love to head in that direction.
Travis: Yeah! Cinnamon Tower! (all laugh)
Taliesin: That sounds weird.
Marisha: I want to live in that world!
Taliesin: I would also like to, quietly on the headphone, I would really like to know where this machine comes from, because I'm finding it just a bit creepy, and I would love to get that information out of him before he disappears.
Travis: How tall is it again?
Matt: It's roughly eight and a half feet tall.
Travis: So just a bit taller than me?
Matt: A bit taller, yeah, I'd say a little larger than that.
Travis: A head and a half?
Matt: It's kind of hunched forward as it walks, it probably could stand taller if it wanted to.
Travis: Was he kind of like, Fassbender size-ish, or?
Matt: Not as broad.
Laura: Fassbender was bigger, right?
Travis: Okay.
Matt: It's tall, but it's kind of lanky in its construction, and it seems to be thicker at the feet and the arms and fists, but the actual structure itself is proportionally pretty thin.
Travis: Got it. It's Groot.
Liam: Hey, Percy...
Taliesin: Yes?
Liam: I faintly remember you talking about, you were talking to someone, I don't know who it was, but you were talking about plans you had for sort of a walking, automated something. Am I imagining that?
Taliesin: I dabbled... No, I talked about it. It always just seemed so impractical. And now I'm looking at one, and I'm irritated.
Liam: Yeah, I can see that.
Marisha: Irritated? Or was inferior the word you were looking for?
Taliesin: Vexed.
Marisha: Vexed, that's a good word.
Laura: It is a good word.
Travis: That's her name.
Liam: To be honest, you seem like you got your goolies burned there just from a conversation, a little bit.
Marisha: I know.
Taliesin: He didn't build this thing, and I'm worried about who did. He didn't build this thing.
Marisha: Percy,
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: Percy.
Liam: Well, you're the expert.
Taliesin: No. Yes. What?
Marisha: Look, you can turn this to your advantage. Brain drain him for all the knowledge you can!
Taliesin: I think we've already done that.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: I think that was an oyster we've already supped upon.
Marisha: I trust your judgement.
Taliesin: Ah yes, that got weird. I'm gonna flip on the cloak by the way, now that we are well out of that area.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Is anyone following us from the Scarbearers?
Matt: The eye that you have been keeping out, you don't notice anyone giving chase or following you.
Liam: Walking with Kelyeth. You know I don't know anything about that shit, but in my experience talent and skill have nothing to do with whether you're a douchenozzle or not. He seems like a schmuck.
Marisha: Oh, he's definitely a douchenozzle.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: (gasps) I think that's the first time I said douchenozzle.
Taliesin: I think it actually is.
Liam: He called you 'antlers'.
Marisha: Yeah he called you 'little elf-girl and little elf-boy'. I don't like him.
Liam: Mm.
Marisha: What's wrong with my antlers?
Liam: Nothing at all
Marisha: I know my hair's shorter so it makes my antlers look bigger, which I was concerned about.
Liam: No, they're very attractive I'm sure you heard---
Marisha: Is it okay?
Liam: Okay? It's your best feature.
Marisha: Thanks?
Laura: I like your face more than your antlers, but both are nice, dear.
Liam: No, definitely the antlers.
Marisha: All right, you know what? Let's move off this conversation.
Laura: I just wanted to ask Tary.
Sam: Oh, yes?
Laura: So your... Doty? Yes?
Marisha: Dottie.
Laura: Dottie, sorry.
Sam: Doty.
Liam: Duty.
Laura: Duty. Got it. Does he fight or does he just write?
Sam: He does what I tell him to do.
Laura: Is he competent in a battle?
Sam: I would say so.
Laura: Has he ever been in battle?
Sam: Doty has been in a battle.
Laura: Does he look like he has any battle scars?
Matt: Glancing over and getting a quick look-- make a perception check actually.
Laura: All right, just doing some--
Travis: Roll your new dice to redeem it for that shit--
Laura: (yells)
Travis: Should have done it.
Laura: No no no, at least it's not a one. 20.
Matt: Okay, glancing over and giving a once over of the giant mechanical creature (footsteps) walking a few feet behind you, you can see there are a lot of signs of repair. You can see there are a lot of places where bits of metal have been re-hammered. Elements have been patched over, and additional layers of armor have been added to it. You do see what appear to be some scrapes and areas where it has sustained various weapon attacks. That whole circumstance. It looks like it's seen some scuffles in it's time.
Laura: Duty looks... worn.
Sam: Doty.
Laura: Doty, my apologies. He looks worn. Old, far older than your armor.
Sam: That may be because in battle I am deft, fearless.
Travis: You're deaf?
Sam: No deft, with a T. I can dodge blows uncannily. I can anticipate what my opponent is going to do ahead of time and dodge out of the way.
Laura: I can see that about you.
Sam: Yes.
Laura: You seem very dexterous too.
Sam: I think I am.
Laura: Yes. Did Doty raise you? Is he like your nanny?
Sam: No, he's a mechanical construct that I made, he did not--
Laura: That you made when you were two? Because he looks like he raised you.
Sam: Doty did not raise me. He is a mechanical construct that I built when I learned how.
Liam: Does he cook?
Sam: He does not cook.
Liam: Does he clean?
Sam: He could clean. I---
Liam: Keep you warm at night?
Sam: No, he's cold as ice.
Laura: How old were you when you built him?
Sam: Well I'm 28 now.
Laura: Yes?
Sam: So that would have been 27.
Laura: He's a year old?
Sam: He's a year old.
Laura: And he only talks to you?
Sam: Nope. He doesn't talk to me.
Laura: Oh, he only listens to you.
Sam: He's the best really. Fearless, strong, big, and excellent penmanship. He's everything I could hope for in a friend. Silent.
Marisha: Were pen pals a thing for you? Is that why you like penmanship?
Sam: I mean, no. I don't think I ever had a penpal.
Marisha: No? Did you have any friends? Ever?
Liam: Or siblings?
Sam: I had tutors. I had the best teachers. I had--
Laura: Aww...
Marisha: Aww...
Sam: --wonderful. No, no! Don't 'aww'. They were wonderfully smart and engaging, but my best friends were the books I read.
Liam: What were Mom and Dad like?
Sam: They're still alive. There's no were. They are wonderful people my father--
Liam: I mean when you were a tyke.
Sam: (sighs) My father is a very talented businessman. He can be hard at times. He has great expectations for everyone he meets. My mother is... a saint; she's perfect in every way. She's a wonderful person and... yes.
Marisha: Really? And they're still alive? Weren't killed in some crazy raid, or... eaten by dragons or...fell in a pit of lava?
Sam: No, they are eagerly awaiting me to arrive back at home and tell them tales of my journeys and adventures.
Liam: What is your father's business?
Sam: He is a businessman.
Liam: A businessman? Is that a taboo subject with you?
Sam: No! Not at all. It's just, I'm not sure how well versed you are in financial transactions.
Liam: Oh, fuck-all. I thought you could give me the layman's terms.
Sam: He is in real estate. He buys and sells properties, charges rent, taxes...
Liam: A land baron.
Travis: So bored right now.
Sam: He owns a lot of things, places and makes a lot of money off of these places.
Liam: Interesting... Interesting.
Travis: Cinnamon Tower.
Sam: I will be forthcoming with anything that you ask me. I have nothing to hide. I come from money; this is clear.
Liam: Can I insight check him on 'I have nothing'?
Matt: Yeah, make an insight check.
Laura: Aw.
Liam: It's terrible, that's all right.
Laura: No, it's not! Don't use luck!
Liam: You shush!
Laura: You can--
Liam: I will use luck if I want to use luck!
Matt: Hard to read. For many reasons!
Liam: I'll say!
Taliesin: I also want to take a good long look at robot and see if I can-- this automaton.
Matt: Okay. Investigation check.
Taliesin: Come on. (sighs) Okay, 13.
Matt: What are you trying to ascertain about it?
Taliesin: How old it is, how it was built, where it was built. Just to get a sense of it, like looking over a classic car.
Matt: Best that you can tell from its construction and your understanding, there is a lot of ingenuity in its design. But it is, it exists, and moves through a combination of decent engineering and enchantment.
Taliesin: Oh thank God! Okay, I feel better.
Matt: You can see very, very faint engravings of various runic glyphs that are similar some of the ones that you saw on--
Taliesin: Fassbender?
Matt: -- Fassbender.
Taliesin: All right. I feel better already, thank you. Ego restored.
Liam: (sings the Legend of Zelda 'item' tune)
Matt: You guys make your way to the Sand Herald District and there you can see the distant towers of the Cerulean Place. The large central one that leads up into the chamber of J'mon Sa Ord. As you approach the outside, you see the familiar faces and armor of the Hands of Ord there, guarding the exterior of the palace walls. As you approach, one of the guards steps up with their same kind of brass and sapphire emblazoned armor, and one of them approaches and steps forward. "I'm sorry. Do you have business at the palace?"
Laura: Yes. Question  the symbol? Scanlan?
Liam: Scanlan had it...
Laura: That's what I thought.
Travis: Oh, fucking shit.
Marisha: I thought we got it back, though.
Laura: Did he give back to us or did he not?
Marisha: Wait, no. Are we talking about the flute?
Liam: No, there was a symbol.
Laura: Remember the symbol that had--
Liam: J'mon's symbol to show to all friends.
Taliesin: I think he still has the symbol, doesn't he?
Marisha: I have his flute because I picked it up last.
Laura: Yeah, that doesn't have his symbol on it though.
Liam: That's not the same thing.
Taliesin: We do bring news though, so...
Marisha: Fuck!
Liam: We are friends to-- the man on top. J'mon, I misspoke.
Laura: J'mon Sa Ord.
Marisha: We need to speak with him.
Liam: Vox Machina is here, he knows us.
Marisha: And return this  I show the flute. Maybe they'll recognize it?
Matt: The guard takes the flute and--
Marisha: I take it and I dust the ash and drug use off of it. And then--
Matt: The guard takes it and looks at it, confused. "Please to be patient, for just a moment."
Laura: Of course, be pleased!
Matt: "Be pleased." Turns around and walks back up the stairs, the front of the palace, and enters through one of the side doorways. About two, three minutes pass. The guards just keep a view out, and then eventually you see an older woman in familiar ceremonial robes exit from the doorway that the guard went into. This is the Grand Maven, Gameshega, who you met and escorted you up into the palace originally. She walks up with her bracelets still jingling as she steps down the stairs, her long robes trailing behind her a good like two-three feet. Her headdress still has little brass quills that streak down, past her shoulders into her mid-back, and as she steps up: "It is good to see all of you once more. I do not believe we have met, I'm sorry, what is your name?"
Sam: Taryon Darrington. Nice to meet you. Be pleased.
Matt: Taryon Darrington, friend of Vox Machina, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. So J'mon would like to extend their greetings to all of you, and respect in the wake of the news of the destruction of the Conclave. You've aided in closing a far too lingering chapter in the history of Marquet and the ruin of the Cinder King. Thank you.
Sam: You're welcome.
Taliesin: We wanted to make sure that they were aware that all of the dragons had been dealt with, and that the Conclave had been completely vanquished.
Matt: This information did make it to the ears of J'mon.
Taliesin: Excellent. And we thank you for your time.
Matt: Of course. Anything else?
Laura: Um.
Marisha: I guess not?
Laura: Well, could I take you aside for a moment?
Matt: "Of course, my dear." And she walks alongside you as you pull her off a little bit.
Laura: We have in our service, in Emon, a wonderful man, who has been of great aid in battling the Conclave as well, and we learned recently that he was expelled from Marquet due to crimes in his youth and was wondering if we could maybe speak in his name and his regard, to you, to clear his name?
Matt: I can see what I can do. What is the name of this gentleman?
Laura: Jarett. His last name?
Liam: Serpersveshzhg?
Sam: Anderson?
Marisha: Howarth.
Laura: Jarett...
Marisha: Howarth. Howarth.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: Jarett Howorth?
Marisha: Howarth.
Laura: Jarett Howarth.
Sam: You have his name?
Laura: Of course she does, because she takes killer notes.
Sam: Holy Bajoly!
Taliesin: She writes everything down.
Sam: I didn't know that he had a name!
Matt: Jarrett Howarth.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay. I will go and take this into the archives, discover and see what can be done.
Laura: Thank you so much. If you find out anything, will you please send word?
Matt: Yes, should we be sending it to Emon as well?
Laura: If you could, send it to Whitestone?
Matt: To Whitestone?
Laura: That would be wonderful.
Matt: Okay. Very well. We have not sent anything to Whitestone before. We will find a way to do so.
Laura: It's an up and coming city. Very prominent on Tal'dorei.
Taliesin: It's on the move.
Laura: It's on the move.
Liam: Would you send J'mon, would you send them our thanks?
Matt: I will do this. I apologize, J'mon is not currently taking audiences.
Laura: Totally fine.
Matt: But I will continue to pass this word onto them.
Laura: Thank you so much.
Matt: Thank you very much. And good day! Be pleased.
Laura: Be pleased.
Travis: Beep-beep!
Matt: As the Grand Maven turns around and heads back up the stairs, the guards take their place and the palace is at rest.
Laura: Welp.
Travis: He must be sick.
Laura: Probably.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: The flu, perhaps.
Marisha: It's been going around.
Laura: Lots of travel happening. Happens when you travel, I hear.
Marisha: It's true, yeah. Anytime you fly.
Taliesin: So I think that concludes this little jaunt, it might be back home now.
Laura: Oh jeez.
Travis: Well, I think it's about time that we see what Tary Jumbo's worth.
Sam: I'm sorry?
Travis: One of your things on your list, right, it was to get in a kerfuffle?
Sam: There's no kerfuffle on the list--
Travis: Riff-ram, bah-zhu.
Sam: --but we are going to have an adventure, is that right?
Laura: So many.
Sam: At some point?
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Laura: All of them.
Liam: Buddy boy, you're buying in for shit you're not really ready for, yes.
Sam: All right.
Travis: We gotta know how--
Sam: So far, we've delivered a dead body part to someone, and had a brief conversation with a guard.
Taliesin: It's only been two hours.
Sam: Is this what you all are about?
Liam: We're gonna take a little time for a day. And then we're gonna take you to hell.
Sam: All right.
Liam: How does that sound?
Sam: Are you speaking metaphorically?
Travis: No, no, literally hell.
Taliesin: No, we're going to hell.
Travis: There's like seven or eleven of them.
Sam: All right.
Liam: Wow.
Travis: Are those together? Close?
Laura: Very big numbers, Grog.
Liam: Sure.
Taliesin: We're taking this one to hell then?
Marisha: Might be a good trial run.
Liam: I don't know. Do you want to put him through his paces?
Travis: Yeah, I think so.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: I want to save traveling the Ozmit Sea and heading to the water Ashari for when Pike is back.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: So, yeah.
Liam: Yeah. Let's take this fucker to hell.
Sam: I don't know what you're talking about.
Marisha: No, we're speaking insanely literally right now. That's what's impressive about it.
Sam: I...
Liam: We are going to Hell.
Sam: All right.
Liam: And you are coming along.
Marisha: And we're taking you with us.
Laura: Shouldn't we see him fight first?
Liam: Yeah, well, let's bring him home.
Laura: I'd hate for him to die immediately.
Liam: Yeah, we want Grog to run him out like a labrador.
Travis: Do I see any large, intimidating looking creatures just walking around where we are at the moment?
Laura: No, not in the city, Grog.
Travis: I'm not talking to you.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: He only has to listen to you at home.
Laura: I know.
Travis: 12.
Matt: Uh, best that you can tell here in the Sand Herald district, no. Most everyone who wanders around here are of noble dress or part of the Hand of Ord.
Travis: You see that fruit merchant over there?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Killed many, many people.
Sam: Oh, well maybe I should pay him to take me on an adventure because Jesus Christ. This is about as fucking boring as I can get.
Travis: I might just hit him. I might just attack him.
Laura: Hey! You know what you can cross off your list? Teleportation, because that's what we're about to do.
Sam: No, really?
Laura: Oh yeah.
Marisha: It's true.
Sam: It's on my list; it's literally on my list.
Laura: I know.
Marisha: Wait what? All right, let's go.
Sam: All right, all right, all right! Finally getting my money's worth.
Marisha: So we're going back to Whitestone?
Taliesin: Yes, Whitestone.
Liam: Yes, get your big boy pants on, Ermergerd.
Sam: It's Taryon!
Marisha: Come on, Doodee.
Sam: Doty.
Matt: All right, as you find a familiar tree you can utilize to transport over to Whitestone, Tary you watch as the center of this tree's trunk suddenly seems to split open with divine energy.
Sam: Cool.
Matt: On the opposite side, you watch this tunnel progress about four or five feet within where it just looks like the striations of the interior of the tree trunk before it emerges on the other side into another town square currently in the middle of an evening.
Sam: Doty, take this down. As the tree split in front of me--
Taliesin: I shove him through.
Sam: Ahhh!
Marisha: You have six seconds!
Matt: As you all tumble through the Transport via Plants spell, you all emerge on the opposite side of the Sun Tree in the center of Whitestone's courtyard. What do you wish to do?
Sam: Oh my. Oh my gods. Where are we? What's going on?  What happened? Where am I? Is this a fantasy world? What happened?
Marisha: Are you feeling nauseous?
Liam: Whack!
Sam: Ahh!
Taliesin: How about now?
Sam: Wow! That was exhilarating! It's like my body fell apart and came back together again!
Laura: That's exactly what it was like.
Sam: It was amazing!
Liam: I've never had that.
Laura: Or it was like walking forward.
Liam: Yeah. I've never had that sensation ever before. Ever.
Sam: I felt a great force behind me, pushing me forward! And then all of a sudden I opened my eyes and was in a new place. Doty, take this down. Today is the greatest day of Taryon Darrington's life. The day that he experienced the wonder of the gods. That's enough for now.
Marisha: Oh my god, did you guys hear that? He thinks I'm a god. Doucher!
Travis: Douchenozzle.
Marisha: Douchenozzle, that's right! That's what it was. Sorry, I'm just learning it.
Laura: What time is it here?
Matt: Technically now that I think about it, it would still be day, because you guys left in the morning to Ank'Harel, and you've been there for a few hours, so it's early afternoon at this point.
Laura: Okay. Oh, fabulous. All right.
Travis: So we're back on home turf, right?
Liam: Yeah, we're going to take this guy to a field and kick his ass, or what are we going to do?
Travis: Yeah, I kind of want to.
Laura: Oh, can I go find Jarett really fast?
Matt: Yeah, it's easy enough to find. You head down to where the makeshift garrison, which has now seen reconstruction, actually being turned into a decent functional garrison within the town itself. A lot of the guards are out there running through their drills for the afternoon, and you can see Jarrett is in the process of running them through what looks like ranged combat training. As you approach, Jarett looks over and watches you walking up from a distance and kind of gives a wave, "Hello!"
Laura: Hi.
Matt: "So, everything seems to be in order here. I have to say, I am very glad to know that we have no more dragons for quite some time." And you see he's recovering; he's healing, but there is noticeable scarring on the side of his neck. And it looks like he's going through the process of recovering from the Thordak battle, but he's doing much better than the last time you saw him.
Laura: How are you mentally?
Matt: To be perfectly honest, very happy to not be anywhere near that terrible city. I never thought I had the sense for the slower parts of the countryside, but I don't know; I've come to like it here in Whitestone.
Laura: It is quite nice. Well, you're welcome to stay.
Matt: Well, I was intending to.
Laura: We are planning to rebuild our home in Emon as well.
Matt: Yes, yes.
Laura: So it's up to you where you'd like to be.
Matt: Really, you employ me so it is more up to you, but I kind of like the change in temperature.
Laura: I do too.
Matt: Bit chillier up here, north.
Laura: Well, in case you're wondering, we just came from Marquet.
Matt: Oh?
Laura: Where we spoke with the Grand Maven?
Matt: Right?
Laura: Of J'mon Sa Ord. Spoke very highly of you and she's working on getting your name cleared.
Matt: Really?
Laura: Well, she said she would. I don't know what you did, dear, but hopefully it wasn't anything too terrible.
Liam: Serial killer.
Matt: He doesn't look nervous at all, he looks elated and is like, "Well, thank you. I hope that comes to a fruitful end. I've been living here long enough where it's not a huge deal to me, but it would be nice to occasionally return--"
Laura: See home?
Matt: Yeah. You know.
Laura: That's nice.
Matt: Thank you, I appreciate that.
Laura: Of course. And you may not have heard, but our resident bard has left us. Possibly for the time being, possibly for more. So you won't be seeing his face around here.
Matt: I am sorry to hear that.
Laura: I only tell you because I saw you speaking with him several times and thought you might want to know.
Matt: This is good to know. Well, I look forward to his return. That being the case, can I ask a favor of you?
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "Could you hold this?" And he reaches back and pulls out a small pouch and puts it in your hand. "I don't feel comfortable holding on to this."
Laura: What is it?
Matt: It was requested by your small bard friend and I probably should not have it on my person.
Laura: Requested?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: What is it? Components of a potion? I don't...
Matt: One that you should not probably drink.
Laura: What is it, Jarrett?
Matt: It's suude. It's illegal. You should not-- It is dangerous.
Laura: It's drugs?
Matt: Yes! Yes it is! Let's talk about it in front of everyone I'm training! Yes, thank you!
Laura: I put it in my pocket.
Matt: Don't do drugs!
Laura: Don't do drugs! Scanlan was doing drugs? Jarett, you sold Scanlan drugs?
Matt: No, I procured them for him at his request.
Laura: Is this why you were expelled from Marquet?
Matt: (unconvincingly) No. (all laugh)
Matt: There are a number of reasons.
Laura: How long have you been providing this to him?
Matt: This was only the second. I did not want to do this! He is a very convincing person and looked like he was going through a hard time.
Laura: Yes, he is.
Matt: And look, I understand that, and I warned him. He knew full well the dangers involved; he's a much stronger man than I am. Who was I to tell him this? And he's very persuasive.
Laura: He is. When was the first time you gave it to him?
Matt: Not more than maybe a week or two ago?
Laura: Thank you. Thank you for giving them to me.
Matt: Yes, it was burning a hole in my pocket. And I don't want to hold onto it.
Laura: I understand.
Matt: Sorry.
Laura: I appreciate your service, Jarrett.
Matt: I appreciate your understanding.
Laura: Get better. Keep training.
Matt: Yes, I should do that.
Laura: All right.
Matt: He turns around, "You lot heard nothing! Nock your crossbows, nock--" (whack) and slaps one guy on the back of the head. "All right. Focus up, on the targets," and you hear him begin taking a few volleys off in the distance as you walk your way back to the castle. The rest of you, as you walk through Whitestone, Taryon, you watch this beautiful, wonderfully slightly backwards city--
Taliesin: Hey! Okay...
Sam: It's amazing.
Matt: It's charming.
Sam: Yes, quaint really.
Matt: Yeah! And there's a castle. They have a castle!
Sam: Tourists must love it here.
Taliesin: We do quite well... in the on season.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah. In years ago.
Travis: Do you mind if you come to the outskirts of the city with us?
Sam: I literally know nothing about this city.
Travis: Great, yeah, come with us. Just Vax knows the way, Vax will you... You know? The spot?
Liam: The beautiful parts of the city, actually, are the countryside, the woods around. It's drab in the middle.
Sam: I paid for adventure.
Travis: Yeah, it's out there.
Liam: And adventure you shall have, my friend.
Sam: All right.
Travis: So can we find our way to like a fairly open and not populated part of Whitestone?
Matt: Yeah. Your best bet, at this point, would be to make your way to the unclaimed gardens in the back of the castle.
Taliesin: I was going to say.
Marisha: Castle courtyards.
Matt: For awhile there was no greenery back there. The processing and disposing of the excess acids lead to the green fume that was billowing behind the castle when you first arrived here and destroyed most of the plant life. Through your aid and the people who kept the castle, those have been filled in and it looks like the castle grounds are starting to recover. There is now a fresh growing season of green back there, and that is closed off. It is protected. There are guards around and it is away from the general populace of Whitestone.
Travis: Nice. This looks like a great place. Now, if you want your first taste of adventure, you need to bring Dottie and come over here.
Sam: Doty.
Travis: I have to whisper it because it's very secret.
Sam: Four-eyes, shall I trust Jumbo here because he seems a bit shady.
Taliesin: Yes, no, you should trust him with your life. He's very trustworthy.
Sam: I will roll an insight check.
Liam: Grog and I are just waiting.
Sam: What do I add to it?
Matt: Your insight skill.
Sam: Oh yeah, that. I have forgotten how to play Dungeons and Dragons. 18.
Matt: Travis, I would like you to roll a deception.
Taliesin: Wait, is it Travis or is it me?
Laura: Is it deception?
Matt: Oh wait, no, it's from you, sorry. Yeah, this is Percival, technically.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Matt: It's kind of both of you.
Travis: Bitch! I rolled a 17.
Liam: So Percy at advantage then, right?
Marisha: You can trust Grog for some things.
Laura: You can!
Sam: Go on!
Travis: Plus I do want to take him on an adventure.
Laura: I feel like Grog is getting far more trustworthy.
Marisha: I agree!
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: You get the sense that maybe not all the information is there.
Taliesin: It's not a lie.
Matt: It's not a lie, but it's definitely-- it speaks of a half truth.
Sam: What's going on out here?
Travis: Secret stuff. Are you ready?
Sam: For what?
Travis: Where's Dottie?
Sam: Doty. He's right behind me, as he always is.
Travis: Nice. So put out your hand like this.
Sam: What's going to happen?
Travis: And take your other hand, and you either make a boulder, a piece of paper, or a pair of shears. Right? And we do it on three.
Taliesin: To be perfectly honest, I'm not entirely sure what's happening either.
Marisha: You've never played Boulder, Paper, Shears?! (all laugh)
Sam: That's the best thing you've ever said, Marisha.
Taliesin: That just went right up my nose. It burns. That is not pleasant.
Sam: Of course I've played Boulder, Paper, Shears.
Travis: Great, great. It's just to see who goes first. Ready?
Sam: One, two, three--
Travis: And on the third one, I cast enlarge with the Titanstone Knuckles,
Liam: And I sneak attack Ermergerd.
Travis: And I smack Doty. (all laugh)
Sam: Fuck, I'm dead.
Liam: Pommel side, pommel side! I'm gonna Kynan him.
Matt: Okay, and you're going after Doty.
Travis: Yup.
Matt: With just your hands?
Travis: Yeah, just a backhand.
Matt: Okay, both you guys roll attack.
Laura: Oh my gosh!
Taliesin: Boulder, Paper, Shears-- Boulder, Parchment, Shears.
Marisha: Boulder, Parchment, Shears.
Travis: 24.
Liam: Natural 20!
Laura: Why do you want a natural 20?! You're going to kill him!
Taliesin: No, no.
Liam: Not with the pommel side, man!
Matt: Okay, go ahead and do your sneak attack damage.
Marisha: Non-lethal.
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: And double it cause you rolled a natural 20. You, go ahead and roll for the backhand, it's one--
Sam: I will be dead.
Travis: It's four, right?
Matt: It's just a backhand. I would say it's one damage plus your strength modifier.
Taliesin: "Vax, where'd you get that amazing armor?"
Travis: Eight, so nine?
Matt: Okay, so nine damage.
Travis: My strength modifier is eight.
Matt: Yeah, so it'd be nine.
Sam: Doty is going to use his reaction to attack Vax.
Matt: Okay, yes.
Sam: Right? Because when attacked within five feet of me, he gets to react?
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: What?!
Sam: To defend me? Or to attack?
Matt: To attack the person who attacked you.
Travis: See, this is a real good way to figure shit out.
Taliesin: I'm already excited by this.
Laura: This is true! This is smart.
Travis: Thanks.
Laura: You're so smart!
Matt: After this round, actually, for the tension basis of this and for the arrangement for the circumstance, I'm going to take a break, and then come back to this, so we can give this the real feel you want to. So after this round. All right, so after-- Okay, so you do seven damage, you backhand Doty (impact sound)--
Travis: Nine! Nine damage, yeah.
Matt: -- and the head turns to the side. The tome falls to the ground, open on the ground so the pages fold a little bit, and the metallic creature (shifting metal) back to you, stands up, and now goes a full six inches taller than you, and then rears back with its fist, and right as it's about to swing, it sees from behind Vax creep up and hit-- how much damage?
Liam: 86.
Matt: 86 points of damage.
Sam: 86 to me?
Taliesin: What?!
Liam: Yes.
Sam: Great. Great.
Travis: Plus I'm enlarged, so I am probably taller than Doty now.
Matt: Actually, that's right, yeah, so even at your enlarged height, you're still probably a good foot and a half, two feet larger than Doty.
Travis: Let's say I hit him, he looks back, and he's looking at my nipples.
Laura: Oh, that's cool.
Matt: Yeah, there you go. As you're growing (robotic motion noises)--
Travis: What happened?
Matt: Goes to punch towards you, however out of the corner of Doty's eye, sees this half-elf show up and whack him right square in the center of the neck and spinal column and then the fist just goes wide and slams toward you. That is going to be a 23 to hit.
Liam: Hits.
Matt: You suffer... Ooh! 16 points of bludgeoning damage.
Laura: Ooh!
Matt: As the giant iron fist of Doty just (whack) clangs into the back of your head and part of your ear and you feel the ringing in your skull from the impact.
Liam: Mm-hm.
Matt: You, Taryon, fall to your knees--
Sam: (pained grunt)
Matt: -- and find a large portion of your vitality and breath and just general awareness knocked out of you from from one singular blow from nowhere. Your eyes go white for a second--
Sam: This is the sound that I make. (high pitched goat-like yelps) (all laugh)
Travis: That's a wuss panic.
Sam: Do I get a shot?
Matt: That was the surprise round, because you were not aware of this circumstance. We're going to continue combat after this break. (cheers and laughter)
Marisha: I'm getting in on this!
Liam: It was his idea!
Matt: Oh yeah. Just so you're aware, everyone who's watching, you just watched your boyfriend cold-cock an innocent person.
Marisha: I watched him walk up behind him and do it. I knew what he was doing.
Matt: All right, just so you're aware. All right guys--
Marisha: This is a part of our Vox Machina hazing. This is what we do!
Matt: This is pretty fucked up, you guys. (all laugh)
Taliesin: So fucked up!
Matt: All right, we'll come back in a few minutes after we take a quick break to continue this combat. We'll see you here shortly. [BREAK]
Matt: Hello everyone and welcome back to Critical Role. So, last we left off, in the middle of the Whitestone courtyard, two members of Vox Machina decided, as part of the hazing process, to assault our new temporary party member.
Taliesin: (laughs) When you put it like that.
Travis: How about test?
Liam: This is literally the third time we have done this.
Matt: I know! I'm not surprised by any of you. It's just-- Oh no, I am surprised, I wasn't expecting it, but it makes sense.
Marisha: Wow, it sounds like us last week.
Matt: Yeah, exactly.
Laura: Hey!
Travis: Or every week.
Matt: That being the case, anyone who cares to get involved in this, I need you to roll initiative.
Taliesin: In.
Marisha: In.
Laura: Am I there?
Sam: Wait, you guys are all doing this to me?
Taliesin: No, I want to be in initiative just to make sure that I can actually make sure that--
Marisha: I want to make decisions.
Matt: Would you have gone with him, or would you have stayed back?
Laura: Well, I was coming from talking to Jarrett so, it's up to you if I'm there yet.
Matt: So yeah, you wouldn't be there actually, yeah.
Laura: Am I walking up as it's happening?
Matt: You will be walking up towards the castle.
Liam: This was a--
Travis: Yeah, this was a Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
Liam: -- Grog whispering to Vax thing, on a walk.
Matt: So. There is no Percival, no Keyleth in, but you guys were--
Taliesin: Oh, I'm in!
Marisha: No, I'm in.
Matt: Okay. Percival's in, yeah, they're there.
Liam: Yeah, we're not trying try to ditch them. I'm just saying. It wasn't an announced thing.
Matt: Yeah, so Vex is the only one who's not there. Okay, so, for those who are present and wish to be part of this: roll initiative. What have we got? So we have...
Sam: Eight.
Travis: (laughs)
Sam: (choking noise)
Taliesin: 25.
Sam: You shouldn't bother. It's over!
Marisha: 16.
Liam: (choking noise) Big 11.
Travis: 18.
Matt: Okay, Percival, you're up first. As you watch Grog backhand this mechanical entity in the face, while Vax appears from the shadows and just beans the back of Taryon across the center of the neck and spinal column--
Sam: (muffled scream)
Matt: -- and he falls to his knee making this horrible, horrible sound.
Liam: (laughs) That's my friend.
Taliesin: Come on man, pick it up, pick it up! I just draw my sword and stand on the sidelines, preparing for whatever is about to happen.
Sam: (gasping for breath)
Matt: Okay. Grog.
Travis: Did Doty go down or-- no, he just stood there looking at me afterwards, right?
Matt: Yeah. Doty just (twang), and looked back at you slowly.
Travis: Right. Where is--
Matt: Unblinking mechanical face.
Travis: Where is Tary Jumbo?
Matt: Right here, about five feet from you.
Travis: I look at him.
Sam: (whimpers)
Travis: I hold up my hand and say  Show me what you have learned (all laugh)
Matt: That's all you do?
Travis: That's it.
Matt: Okay, that's Grog's turn. Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay, first and foremost I'm going to create a windwall, around us, like an arena.
Matt: Like an arena.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: (wind swirling) And then I'm gonna--
Matt: Suddenly, the wind kicks up around (heavy wind). The leaves and various fallen parts of the greenery around here kick up into this torrent around you, as the wind is now creating a barrier around the battlefield.
Marisha: Yeah, I turn to Percy and I say  man, you know, I almost feel bad for the guy.
Sam: (gasps loudly)
Taliesin: Give him a boost.
Marisha: Should I give him a boost?
Taliesin: Give him a boost.
Marisha: Should we give him an incentive?
Taliesin: Nah.
Marisha: All right, we'll start with a boost. And I give him a healing word.
Matt: Okay, what level?
Marisha: We'll give him a level two.
Matt: Level two, all right. 2d4 plus six.
Marisha: I guess you're worth it. Oh, you got real lucky Tary. I got a four and a three, which adds to be seven. Plus...
Matt: Plus six for your Wisdom, so it's 13.
Marisha: 13 points. And then I say  come on, Tary!
Sam: (high-pitched) What? Who said that? Why is the wind blowing?
Matt: Vax, what are you doing? (all laugh)
Liam: I bring my hand around the back of his head, and I'm gonna use my action to cast Lay on Hands and dump all 15 hit points into the back of his head. Then I'm going to use Disengage and hop back away from him and say-- Oh, no! Before I hop back and say: we are a bunch of fucking assholes and this is all you are going to get with us. Are you sure? And then use Disengage to roll back.
Matt: All right. And you move back away from him?
Liam: Yeah, but I have my movement plus-- Yes, back.
Matt: How far?
Liam: 30 feet.
Matt: 30 feet.
Matt: All righty. Yep, okay. That ends your turn. Taryon. What do you wish to do?
Travis: First time.
Sam: Hands shaking, body quivering, blood everywhere. (all laugh)
Liam: No, no, no--
Matt: No, out of the nose.
Liam: You have a massive headache.
Matt: You did 88 damage to him from behind with the back of your dagger. There is blood out of his nose, out of his ears.
Liam: I just wanted to get him to unconscious. If I'm not a master assassin--
Laura: Nope.
Liam: How can I not go (thu-kunk) and not--
Marisha: You at least split his head.
Travis: He has weak capillaries.
Matt: Understand, you critically hit him from behind to do 88 points of damage.
Liam: Right.
Matt: That would have killed a regular human being.
Liam: Right, right.
Matt: Or at least have put them in a-- He's not like, bleeding out.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: But he looks rough. (all laugh)
Liam: Did I make it clear that I was trying to do this to Sam and not Tary? (all laugh)
Matt: No. Sam, what are you doing?
Sam: I-- I, shit, well Grog gets an attack, but I'm going to--
Matt: Actually, Grog is not directly in a melee with you, so Grog does not.
Sam: Oh, I'm going to counter clockwise around Doty, all the way round.
Matt: All the way around to here?
Sam: Yeah, yeah. All the way round, yeah. So I'm facing Grog and the others, in a sort of a cone pattern. And I fumble, I'm fumbling on the helmet, trying to find the right gem to pull out. And I pull out a diamond. And I pluck it out of the helmet and I go (screams). And I will cast Prismatic Spray.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Laura: Oh shit!
Matt: So just past Doty, (whoosh), as a familiar, and previously prevented, blast of rainbow arcane energy comes shooting forth from Taryon's hand. Hitting Grog, Keyleth and Percival.
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: I need you all to make a dexterity saving throw.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Awesome.
Taliesin: I get advantage on that.
Matt: You do, because of your cloak.
Taliesin: It's a-- What saving throw? I'm so sorry.
Matt: What's the DC on that?
Sam: Oh! On me?
Matt: Yes, on the helmet.
Sam: The helm is 18.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 13.
Marisha: 23.
Sam: Wow.
Taliesin: 20.
Sam: Wow, guys.
Matt: Okay, so. Both of you guys halve the damage. Grog does not.
Travis: Gimme what you got.
Liam: Show me what you got!
Marisha: Show me what you got!
Taliesin: I'm going to use my reaction to swallow part of the spell, so I'm going to take half damage of his half damage.
Matt: Okay, got you. I'm going to go ahead and do this.
Marisha: Can you do the chargey thing?
Taliesin: Mm-hm. But I'm fully charged.
Marisha: Oh, that's cool. That's cool.
Taliesin: I can use this as long as I have a reaction.
Marisha: Right.
Sam: Do I roll? Do you roll?
Matt: Actually, you get to roll. If you want to. So it's 10d6 damage.
Sam: Maybe you should roll.
Matt: Okay, I did roll for that one.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Matt: Just in case, so--
Sam: 10d6 what damage?
Matt: I'm gonna figure that out here in just a minute.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm so excited.
Matt: 41 damage, however, against you, Percy.
Marisha: If you've vaporized me, I'm going to be real pissed.
Matt: That is 41 points of poison damage to you.
Taliesin: Halved.
Matt: Reduced to 20, reduced to ten.
Taliesin: To ten.
Matt: And your charges are still full, regardless.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Keyleth.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You take 41 points of fire damage, halved to 20. So, 20 points of fire damage as the red beam hits you and the flames just burn across. The front of your hair blown back from the blast of the heat. Percival, you feel the sickly ray of the poison splatter past and cover your skin with this semi-translucent poisonous liquid. Grog, you take 41 points of cold damage.
Travis: I have resistance, with my new exalted knuckles.
Matt: You do. So, you take 20 points of cold damage from that.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: So, the beam subsides and you see them all blasted with it, but they're still standing.
Sam: (gasps)
Matt: Perturbed by it.
Sam: How are they still alive? (all laugh)
Matt: And Doty's at the ready, (metal hitting metal) What do you want Doty to do?
Marisha: New kid's got game.
Sam: Well, first of all, as my bonus action, I will cast Sanctuary on myself.
Marisha: What the fuck is that?
Travis: What is that?
Sam: It protects me from things. (all laugh)
Sam: Like a lot.
Travis: We'll see.
Matt: (laughing) Yeah, I love it.
Travis: That's a new one right? We haven't come up against that before.
Sam: They're all new, friend.
Matt: All right, so Sanctuary on you, and what do you want to tell Doty to do?
Sam: Doty, I will say, (gasping for breath) Doty, save me... Save me! Hit the big guy!
Matt: (metal grinding and a heavy force swinging) And is going to go in for ... The giant fist hit towards you. That is going to be a 17 to hit. What's your AC?
Travis: That is my AC.
Matt: All right, that hits. And then, after the fist comes back and smacks you in the face, across the jaw, for nine plus five-- 14 points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Beautiful.
Matt: The hand grabs the front your clavicle, pulls back, and attempts to headbutt you. That's a natural 20.
Liam: Ooh.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Travis: Nice. I love it.
Marisha: Yeah? Yeah.
Matt: That is 14-- That is 19 points of bludgeoning damage. So, halved to nine.
Liam: That's terrible.
Travis: I'm not raging.
Matt: That's right! So--
Travis: 19 points of bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Yeah, so 19 points of bludgeoning damage. As Doty just (clang) slams you right in the middle of the face. You feel the nose kinda (cracking noise) from the break, and the blood getting gushed from your nostrils. From the headbutt.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: All right, that ends Doty's turn. Sanctuary's on you. Next up, top of the round, Percival.
Taliesin: Mm.
Marisha: Yeah, that Prismatic Spray was impressive.
Taliesin: That was very impressive, yes.
Marisha: What are you gonna do?
Taliesin: I don't know. I think I'm just gonna enjoy watching this for a minute.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm gonna hold my attack. Until he pulls out another object. Of any kind.
Matt: Okay, so you're holding until he fiddles with an object.
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: Okay. That brings it to Grog.
Travis: Right. That was a pretty good hit, and now I'm angry. And I rage.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'm dead.
Matt: Bonus action, rage.
Travis: And I walk up so I am within melee-- Actually, I'll go opposite... yeah, on the other side of Tary from Doty.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I don't attack of opportunity, do I?
Travis: No, no, I wanna be on Tary, opposite of--
Matt: You weren't in combat with him.
Sam: Got it.
Travis: Yeah, no, I wanna be-- I wanna put Tary between me and the big robot.
Matt: Oh I see. So you go this way.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. Great. I will say Doty does get an attack of opportunity on you.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: As you pull out of the way. That is a nine. That does not hit you.
Travis: Nope.
Matt: (whoosh) Just too slow, and too wide as the rage kinda instills you with adrenaline, and you dodge past.
Sam: Dammit, Doty, do better!
Matt: All right.
Travis: And as I look down, dribbling out of my mouth, I say, Is that it? And that's my turn.
Laura: Oh, God.
Sam: What? You're not gonna kill me?
Matt: That's your turn?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth.
Marisha: (sighs) Should I make this more interesting? What haven't we tested yet? We haven't really seen him dodge yet, right?
Taliesin: I think we should see him dodge.
Marisha: See how well he can dodge. And I throw a Fireball. (explosion)
Laura: (gasps)
Marisha: Right next to Tary.
Matt: Next to Tary? Okay.
Marisha: I don't wanna mess up Grog. Just Tary and Doty.
Matt: Okay, make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: Whoa.
Marisha: Make a wisdom saving throw?
Travis: (gasps)
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Why? Because...
Travis: Because he asked you to.
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: You find out afterwards.
Marisha: The fuck did you do?
Sam: I got tricks.
Travis: Sanctuary.
Marisha: I got-- oh, Sanctuary. Against spells? Even though this is an AOE?
Travis: What's an AOE?
Matt: Any attack or spell that targets the warded creature with an attack, so yes.
Marisha: Any attack or spell. All right. So, let's roll this one. Not great. That's not great, but luckily I got really high wisdom. So, 18.
Matt: What's your spell DC, Tary?
Sam: My spell DC? Is 17.
Matt: Okay, so yeah. Go ahead and roll your Fireball damage. Tary, I'm gonna need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Oh my God.
Marisha: Ow, jeez, oh my God. There's like-- There was like a little twinge.
Taliesin: You should have Vax work that out, later.
Marisha: I think I was-- No, it's this guy.
Sam: What do I do?
Matt: Dexterity saving throw, please.
Sam: Oh, that's not gonna go well.
Taliesin: No, you should get someone to work on that.
Marisha: I think it's Tary.
Sam: Yeah, that's an 11.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll damage if you don't mind, Keyleth.
Liam: Oh my God, he is hanging on by a thread.
Travis: This is amazing.
Marisha: Wait, where's my-- Who stole my book?
Sam: I have your book.
Marisha: Fireball!
Sam: But I need it more than you, you get nothing!
Marisha: I need to know what Fireball does.
Matt: (laughs) 8d6 points of damage.
Marisha: What is it?
Matt: 8d6 points of fire damage.
Sam: Oh my God.
Marisha: 8d6?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I got it. One-- one, two...
Laura: Where am I on my walk up? Can I hear this going on?
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: You hear the distant-- As you're walking up towards the front of the castle, you see, suddenly, this blast of multicolored arcane energy just, (shhhh) out from over the castle wall.
Laura: Take off running.
Matt: You start running. Through the castle?
Laura: As fast as I can get there-- The way I know to get there the--
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Would it be faster to go up-- Broom up and over? Into the courtyard.
Matt: Probably, otherwise you'd--
Laura: Let's do that.
Matt: Okay so you immediately take the broom, slam it under, and begin flying at dash speed. It'll still take you a couple rounds to get there.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: And as you begin to crest up you see a fiery explosion in the middle of the courtyard, now.
Laura: I make sure I take off my hat.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: 34 damage. So he did not dodge, though, right?
Matt: No, so it's 34 points of fire damage.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You're still ...
Matt: Vax!
Sam: Alive?
Taliesin: You're still alive.
Matt: It is your turn.
Liam: I take both daggers and I shove them in my belt, and I start circling down-- I'm looking at the map-- yeah, that way, and just start talking. Tary. Tary.
Sam: Who's talking?!
Liam: It's the elf boy. This is what we do, this is what we're gonna be facing, all right? Guys, we're fine, we're fine, that's enough.
Marisha: You sure?
Liam: Are you sure you want to play with us? Because we're going somewhere very dangerous very soon, and they did not play nicely with me. We're about to go to hell with someone who did not deal fairly with me.
Taliesin: Several of us have already died.
Marisha: I drop the wind wall.
Matt: And as you come up over the outside perimeter wall of castle Whitestone, you watch as the wind that is whipping around slowly subsides, and there in the center of the courtyard, you see the rest of your friends encircling Taryon Darrington, who is currently on one knee almost, and looks a little worse for wear.
Liam: You can come along, and buddy, let me tell you something, if we get in the middle of the shit, I will protect you, but it is going to be rough. And they're not going to call off their attack like we are. Are you sure you want to write this book and come with us?
Laura: Can I cannonball Trinket into the middle of it?
Matt: Sure. In the middle of this conversation, you watch, out of the corner of your eye, Taryon--
Laura: Not at Taryon, at my party.
Matt: I know, but he looks over, because they're all facing him, and he looks up and sees you arcing over the top of the wall, and suddenly there's a flash of dark energy and a large bear, an armored bear, rolls out and just breaks into the center of everyone here as Taryon's pulling back, and now roars.
Sam: (yells)
Laura: What the fuck is happening? I step away for five seconds and everybody's at war.
Marisha: No, no, this isn't war.
Travis: Yeah, we're playing.
Marisha: This is great, we were just giving him a little trial run. Isn't that right, Tary? Isn't this great?
Sam: No, this is not good.
Marisha: He's fine.
Liam: Are you changing your mind?
Sam: I can't do this. I can't do any of this. I'm sorry.
Liam: Oh, wow.
Sam: I'm not a real adventurer. That was a story I told you. I know it was very convincing, but I haven't been on any real adventures, ever, and--
Marisha: We knew that as soon as you said you wanted to rescue a damsel.
Sam: I know that you thought that I was an adventurer.
Marisha: We never-- no.
Sam: I know that you all look at me and you just see the armor and the handsomeness--
Taliesin: The armor, yes.
Sam: --and the bravado.
Taliesin: The armor.
Sam: And you think, he has it all.
Taliesin: It's very nice armor.
Sam: He has everything that we want. But it's a lie. It's a ruse.
Laura: Can I land? (all laugh)
Matt: And Trinket is still holding this aggressive stance to the rest of you, just in the vicinity, and looks a little more confused and just sits down.
Laura: Yeah, I think we're fine here, Trinket.
Marisha: You notice we tend to make a lot of people cry?
Laura: You made him cry?
Taliesin: We do.
Marisha: We make a lot of people cry.
Laura: What the fuck happened?
Taliesin: We thought we would just give him a little taste of where he's going to make sure that he was up to it.
Marisha: We told him we were gonna go see Hotis and defeat him in the Nine Hells, and we wanted to make sure he lived.
Taliesin: We couldn't have this happen in the Nine Hells.
Marisha: Yeah, look at him.
Taliesin: There's no crying in the Nine Hells.
Liam: The worst place in all the multiverse, and we're gonna let him smack into that for his first time?
Laura: Tary, you could die.
Sam: I... can I be real with you guys?
Laura: Oh, we're ready.
Taliesin: All right, all right.
Sam: (tearfully) My sister's gonna get everything. All the money. The whole business. The compound, the villas, everything. He's giving it to my sister unless I prove myself. All right? I just came out here to prove myself to my old man. And I know that if I do, he will respect me finally, and he will give me my money, and my trust fund, and he will give me my villa, and I will be the guy who takes over the business. And I just-- I thought that I could. But I can't. And I neeeed to. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Oh son, oh son.
Laura: Oh, Tary.
Liam: I walk over.
Taliesin: Daddy issues, that's all we had to hear.
Sam: I need to, I need to.
Liam: I kneel in front of him and I start massaging where I fucking beaned him.
Laura: Oh, careful there, it'll leave a bruise.
Matt: It stings a lot.
Liam: No, no, I have very deft fingers.
Marisha: Honestly, if you would've led with daddy issues, we probably would've trusted you.
Taliesin: We would've just taken you right on.
Liam: Because fathers can be assholes.
Taliesin: They're so awful.
Sam: He doesn't like me, and he doesn't like the books I read, and he doesn't like that I like fantasy novels, and he doesn't like anything about me.
Taliesin: It's like looking into a dark mirror. I don't know how I feel about this very dark mirror right now.
Liam: I take him into a gentle headlock and I turn to my sister and say, Ahh, this guy.
Laura: Ahh, this guy.
Liam: Now I like this guy.
Travis: I raise my hands above my head.
Liam: Wait, what are you doing, what are you doing?
Travis: Are we not finishing this?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No.
Liam: No.
Laura: Not so much.
Marisha: We just learned that Tary's an ugly crier. We can't beat him over the head after that.
Matt: Trinket's head pokes just into frame to you, Taryon, and he goes (licks)
Sam: (yelps)
Laura: No no no. He's my pet.
Liam: That was terrible tough love, and I'm very sorry. I think you should come with us.
Laura: What?
Liam: I think you should.
Sam: I can be like an apprentice. Or an intern. You guys are so powerful and I'm not.
Liam: Do you know something? That fucking gaudy hat you're wearing? I would have no idea how to harness the power of that hat.
Sam: Really?
Liam: I don't know shit about shit. All I know how to do is hit people in the back of the head, that's the one skill that I have. You know a lot more than I do. All you lack is experience.
Laura: Yeah, but I really am a little worried he's gonna die in the Nine Hells.
Liam: Well, I'm worried that we're all going to die in the Nine Hells.
Laura: Isn't there somewhere a little less scary we can take him?
Travis: Yeah, there's other stuff we need to do.
Liam: Is there?
Marisha: I guess we could go ahead and head to the Water Ashari. It should be fairly calm.
Travis: Tary, have you ever passed out from drinking too much?
Sam: No.
Travis: Have you ever been unconscious?
Sam: Only when I go to sleep at night. (all laugh)
Liam: Oh my gosh.
Laura: Oh no, I like him! Damn it.
Liam: We had to beat him to a bloody pulp before we liked him.
Marisha: Look, we're all fuck-ups. We like people who show their vulnerabilities.
Sam: No, I'm brave and strong.
Taliesin: No, no.
Laura: Nobody likes a dick. Well.
Marisha: Or a douchenozzle.
Laura: There it is.
Travis: Now you're using it too many times.
Marisha: Too much? Okay.
Taliesin: Your cowering honesty has won us over. Let's get you a beer. Would you like a beer?
Sam: No, I don't drink beer.
Taliesin: Would you like a glass of wine?
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: We have wine. We have a lot of wine. Some of it is quite good.
Sam: Really?
Taliesin: Really.
Sam: Because the stuff we had in Ank'harel was really gross. I didn't wanna say anything, but--
Taliesin: No, we know it was gross.
Sam: It was really gross.
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: It had no terroir.
Taliesin: Sometimes we must sacrifice for the adventure.
Laura: Do you have any wine in your bag of holding?
Sam: No!
Taliesin: We have wine.
Laura: I know, I just want to taste his wine.
Taliesin: Well, that's fair.
Sam: I don't have any wine.
Travis: Has Dotty been in any fights, or--
Sam: Doty.
Matt: Which, for the record, you now look over and Doty has been writing all this down. (all laugh)
Taliesin: You are the worst person, I love you.
Sam: Doty, no! Why? Just pause for now.
Laura: No, but seriously, was he your nanny? It's okay if he was. I just want to know.
Liam: I mean, honestly, we'd like--
Laura: We'd like you more.
Liam: We like fuck-ups. We're a family of fuck-ups, so, you want in or not?
Laura: If you're honest.
Sam: Doty is my best friend. My only friend. Because he listens to me, and understands me, and at night, when I play my characters, he plays with me. I play combat, and I pretend to be some of the characters I've read about, and he pretends to be the others.
Travis: I'm gonna kill him. (all laugh)
Laura: No, that's really wonderful. So you want to be an actor.
Sam: No, I want to be a hero. And I just haven't had the chance yet because my father says that I should just be focused on taking over the family business, learning financial things. And learning how to shake down a customer, and I'm so much more than that.
Marisha: There are other ways of being a hero than being an adventurer. There are a lot of ways you could be a hero.
Sam: Tell me one.
Laura: You could be a philanthropist.
Marisha: Yeah. People who spend a lot of their earnings and people who are more privileged, like you, who help people in less privileged places.
Liam: There are many ways to help people in need.
Sam: Do they write books about philanthropists?
Laura: A lot of times they do.
Marisha: Yeah. People generally like them.
Sam: But the stories I've read of adventure and derring-do and bravery--
Travis: Much cooler.
Sam: Much cooler!
Travis: Less boring.
Sam: Jumbo gets it.
Travis: I promise you, none of their dads leave the adventurers' money to their daughters, it's always to the sons.
Liam: But first I'd like to suggest a mantra. I don't know if you've ever tried it. It helps for me, it has in the past. Fuck your dad. That's one--
Laura: Well.
Taliesin: Well.
Liam: You know what I mean, you fucking third-grade assholes, jeepers creepers.
Sam: He could have me or any of you killed.
Liam: We'll see. The other thing is, you've done the impossible.
Sam: Which is?
Liam: Well, I've taken a shine to you for some reason. Do you wanna shake off the child's play and do the real thing?
Sam: Very much.
Liam: The truth is, you never stop being afraid. Being brave doesn't mean you stop being afraid, it means you learn to compartmentalize it. You just live with it. So that feeling you're feeling? You're not gonna lose that.
Sam: Okay. But how will I survive in battle?
Liam: Well...
Travis: Healing potions, people who look out for each other.
Taliesin: Friends. Friends.
Laura: Hide behind your giant robot.
Liam: This guys absorbs damage, so stick by him.
Laura: Stay clear if what you do is cast spells. Don't get up in the fray.
Marisha: I can cast spells, and so can Vex, here. It's through my antlers, so respect the antlers.
Sam: Oh, I do. I do. They look very powerful.
Marisha: Respect.
Sam: Something about your eyes make me feel ashamed.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Wow.
Sam: I'm sorry.
Travis: Oh, shit. That is a new one.
Laura: Let's go get a drink.
Liam: Can we get this guy drunk, please.
Taliesin: We're getting into shame and we're sober, I think something must be done about this.
Travis: We got him so close to the brink, right? Shouldn't we just introduce him to the deep end so he can say he's been there, and then we bring him up?
Laura: What, like knock him unconscious?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Please don't.
Travis: No, no, really, there's something to be said for it.
Taliesin: Why don't we do it with wine?
Liam: Yeah, yes, Percy's right.
Marisha: We could do a little roleplay exercise, like in your stories.
Taliesin: We have a magnificent library.
Sam: You do?
Taliesin: Oh, yes.
Travis: Oh, god.
Marisha: Full disclosure.
Taliesin: It's time we had another nerd.
Marisha: Full disclosure, Tary, there aren't many damsels you have to rescue in the wild. I've learned mainly because women in the world have to be tougher. So that doesn't happen very often. But, if you want, we can make pretend and do a little thought exercise, and I'll pretend to be in distress and you can rescue me if that'll make you feel better.
Travis: Yeah yeah yeah, he just has to vanquish me.
Marisha: Yeah, but you have to vanquish Grog.
Sam: All right, let's go get drunk, then.
Taliesin: Okay! (all laugh)
Marisha: Okay! (all laugh)
Liam: We really haven't had a barn-burner since we got back from the big do, you know. We should get your sister, we should get Shaun, we should get Allura and Kima and anyone who's in town.
Taliesin: Let's have a good drink, and in the morning we'll set off on the next leg of idiocy.
Liam: Yeah, you know, Tary, there's something you don't really know about-- we've just-- I mean, it's really complicated, it's hard to explain to you, you're an outsider. But we have just lost someone very dear to us. It's very complicated. And maybe we're dealing with shit that is hard, so I'm sorry if we pushed you too hard. I think there was benefit to be had from what just happened, but we're in a shitty headstate. A dear friend is gone, so, apologies.
Sam: I understand. I haven't really experienced loss of that type before. I mean. But I want to understand, and I thank you for your honesty with me and for not holding back. Did I at least cause you some harm in the battle?
Marisha: Yes!
Liam: I thought you would go down in one shot, and you were still standing!
Travis: It was pretty weak, actually.
Taliesin: I still feel a little ill.
Marisha: Yeah! And look, you singed a little of my hair!
Sam: That's good, right?
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: To be fair, we've killed dragons, so the fact that you actually managed to hold it together is actually quite impressive!
Liam: I mean, clearly we've been fucking with you a little bit, but you have ability and skill, and that's not bullshit. Seriously.
Travis: Yeah, the rest's just fake it 'til you make it, yeah?
Liam: Yeah. That will get you--
Laura: I didn't see any of it, so I'm not sure.
Sam: It was really great. It was really great?
Taliesin: Yes!
Liam: Yeah! Yes!
Sam: Thank you, thank you all. I'm sorry for deceiving you before, and I promise to do better and to aid you in whatever way I can. Please teach me your ways, and I will learn what I can.
Travis: Did you build Dotty?
Sam: For heaven's sake, yes! I did.
Liam: I believe him, I believe him.
Travis: Let's open him up and figure out if he's lying.
Sam: Please no, no, I, no--
Taliesin: No no no no no.
Laura: (laughs) Grog!
Travis: What.
Laura: Stop. (laughs)
Liam: (whispers) He's just-- he's fucking with you, it's fine. (normal volume) It's all right. It's all right. Let's go get drunk.
Marisha: Yeah!
Laura: That's all we do.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Get drunk and make people cry.
Liam: It's been too long, are you kidding?
Sam: All right, I hang back just a little bit to collect myself. Just try to dry my eyes, and I say to Doty: Doty, just delete most of that last chapter--
Matt: (sounds of Doty ripping and crumpling paper)
Sam: -- and take this down. "The battle a draw, Taryon decided it was better to lie than tell the truth, and embarked on a new adventure pretending to be their humble intern, when in actuality, they were working for him." End of chapter!
Matt: (sounds of book slamming shut and Doty walking)
Liam: Oh my gosh, that can go in any direction.
Taliesin: I love it.
Laura: So dark. SO DARK!
Travis: We're getting to the deep end!
Matt: (chuckles) As Doty follows you, you guys make your way into the castle. Wine bottles are brought about, and a raucous evening of drinking is easily found. The barn-burner you're looking for: Shaun is able to be mustered, Jarrett, Kima's still back in Emon, and actually Allura is in town briefly to retrieve Pike. And as Pike comes in, she reaches you guys. "Hi. Apparently there's still a lot of recovery that's needed in Emon and they need kind of an all-hands-on-deck circumstance with anyone who's trained in healing, so I may have to go help with that for a little bit, if that's okay?"
Liam: Oh, man.
Travis: Yeah, of course!
Laura: Whatever you need, dear.
Matt: I mean, don't-- don't go-- (sigh) don't go to any crazy hell places without me, let me know before that happens, please.
Laura: Oh. Right.
Travis: (scoffs) No, we would never!
Sam: That's exactly what they're planning on doing!
Travis: No, Tary, what did we say about lying?
Sam: They just said that they're taking me to hell, or something like that!
Laura: Well, we won't, obviously, if you don't want us to, Pike.
Taliesin: We've decided to go a little softer with him.
Liam: We're figuring it out.
Matt: I mean, try and at least let me know?
Laura: 'Course.
Marisha: Pike, I have to eventually go visit the Water Ashari, but I didn't want to do that without you.
Matt: It's fine, go! I mean, I don't know how much help I'll be other than just getting you there, but there's plenty of people that can, you know, helm a ship and get you across the sea.
Marisha: Is there any advice you can give?
Matt: Hire a good crew. Really. I was but one of many and everything I learned, I learned from watching other people. You might learn more than I did!
Marisha: All right.
Matt: Okay?
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Pike. I step away with her. (all laugh)
Laura: How are you? I mean, you're heading off to Emon right after Scanlan left, does this have anything to do with him?
Matt: I could use the distraction, to be honest. You'll be fine, I mean, it's all tying up loose ends, and I'm more needed helping people that really need what I can do right now.
Laura: I understand.
Matt: It won't be long, they're gathering a lot of great healers. I know Keeper Yennen's coming along--
Laura: Oh, good.
Matt: -- and we're gonna be doing some people some real good.
Laura: All right.
Matt: Might even bring the love of my Lady to a few people. Her light can definitely heal a lot of wounds and spirits, so.
Laura: All right. I give her a big hug, and I whisper in her ear. You don't always have to put on a brave face, dear.
Matt: She pulls back from you and kind of pats you on the side of your face.
Matt: "Yeah, I do." And she smiles and turns around and puts her hand out, and Allura takes her hand. "Are we ready?"
Travis: Wait, bye, Pike!
Matt: She lets go of Allura's hand, runs up real fast, and just slugs you in the face--
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: -- and jumps into your arms.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Ohh.
Travis: You go be a monster, and you heal all the people.
Matt: I will!
Travis: All right.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Okay, bye.
Matt: "Bye." She turns around and runs back to Allura.
Liam: It's pretty good.
Travis: That got harder, man, damn.
Liam: It's pretty good.
Matt: After Yennen is summoned forth, the three of them vanish into a swirl of arcane energy, towards the direction of Emon.
Laura: (exhales) First one goes, then the other.
Taliesin: She'll be back.
Laura: (sighs)
Liam: We're gnomeless.
Laura: Gnomeless.
Sam: Was that your girlfriend, Jumbo?
Travis: What'd you say?
Sam: Was that your girlfriend?
Liam: (sharp inhale) We just got good.
Sam: Oh. Sorry. I don't-- I'm just trying to catch up. I'll--
Taliesin: That's fair, that's fair.
Travis: Let me see your hand.
Laura: It's a fair question.
Sam: My hand?
Travis: Yeah, hold your hand out.
Sam: My hand?
Travis: Yeah, put it in mine.
Sam: Please don't kill me.
Marisha: Aw.
Taliesin: Aw.
Marisha: That was a good exercise in restraint, Grog. Proud of you.
Travis: (grumbling)
Liam: Come here. Tell me more about your father.
Sam: He's really a rotten guy. (sighs) He does these unfair deals-- nobody knows about them but me, and I tried to tell him to play on the up and up but he's just a liar and a cheat.
Liam: That's terrible. Drink up, by the way.
Sam: Oh, thank you.
Marisha: So how long have you been set forth on your little mission to prove yourself worthy?
Sam: Month, month and a half.
Liam: Really?
Marisha: Welcome aboard the proving-yourself train.
Sam: I hired a band of mercenaries to assist me for the first month.
Laura: Did you really get them killed?
Sam: No, they left me. (all laugh)
Taliesin: (sighs)
Laura: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Natural 20.
Marisha: (gasps)
Sam: Truth.
Laura: All right.
Travis: Is that your real name?
Sam: Yes, it is.
Travis: Thought you would've made a shitty name like that one up.
Sam: Taryon Gary Darrington. (all laugh)
Marisha: Wow, your dad really is an asshole.
Sam: Yes, he is.
Liam: No.
Taliesin: How's your sister, at least? Is your sister reasonable?
Sam: She's the fucking worst.
Taliesin: Oh, no.
Marisha: What?
Sam: Yes, she's so-- She's such a jock. She just does push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups all day and all night and beats on me. She's younger than me, but she's so much stronger.
Travis: What's her name?
Sam: Her name is-- I wrote this down.
Laura: What's my sister's name? You don't know!
Sam: (ugly cries) (all laugh)
Sam: Mary-Anne.
Laura: Mary-Anne Darrington.
Travis: Mary-Anne.
Sam: Mary-Anne Darrington.
Taliesin: Mary-Anne. Marian Darrington.
Laura: Marion Darrington.
Travis: Is she older, or younger?
Taliesin: Marion Darrington.
Marisha: Marion Darrington. (laughs)
Sam: My father, Howard--
Taliesin: He is the worst person.
Sam: -- and my mom, Maria.
Marisha: Maria.
Travis: Is Mary-Anne older or younger than you?
Taliesin: Younger.
Sam: Younger!
Travis: Is she married?
Sam: No. She's not a married Marion. (all laugh)
Taliesin: She's a maid Marion?
Laura: Oh...
Marisha: She's a maid Marion.
Taliesin: No. Maid Marion Darrington.
Sam: She's all focused on the business, and taking it over when Dad's ready to retire.
Taliesin: Then she'll be a made maid Marion. (all laugh)
Travis: Wow...
Taliesin: I may be drunk. (all laugh)
Marisha: That's fun.
Liam: Was there anything good about your upbringing? Any positive points?
Sam: Yes. Yes, I learned so much. I was left to my own devices for hours on end. I traveled the world... in literature. And I experienced such great adventures, tales of history and fiction and-- For most of my life, I was just a happy-go-lucky kid in my room. Reading my books, and making up characters that I would fight against, and only recently have things gotten pretty bad with Dad, since I am now of age to take over the business, and uh--
Liam: At the early age of 28?
Sam: Well, he's getting up in years. Wants to retire to the southern villa.
Taliesin: This is such a dark mirror. This is a very dark mirror.
Marisha: I'm concerned-- I'm sorry, I'm confused. Tary. That was a Freudian slip. Why does your father think it's important to have brute strength and combat experience to run a business?
Sam: It's less about strength and more about a cutthroat attitude. Take no prisoners. Hold back nothing. Pull no punches.
Marisha: Are you sure your father's a real estate agent?
Sam: To be honest, he doesn't take me along with him to many business deals, but he has great influence over many places and cities, and important people, and I don't exactly know the ins and outs of the business--
Sam: But (inhales) I do know that he is ruthless and a bastard, if you ask me truthfully.
Liam: Literally?
Sam: No, I mean, we had a grandfather, so I-- I mean, I think he's not really a bastard. I think. I don't know. What do you mean? (all laugh)
Liam: I mean. What do I mean? I mean, was he the offspring of--
Sam: He has a father.
Liam: I'm sure he does. Was he married to your mother?
Sam: I think so. They were around a lot.
Liam: So you mean, shithead?
Sam: He's an asshole.
Liam: All right.
Marisha: That's a long walk to get to shithead.
Taliesin: That was a long walk to--
Liam: There's a lot of backstory here that you're not privy to.
Marisha: What's your father's name?
Sam: Howard.
Taliesin: Howard.
Liam: Howard.
Laura: Howard Darrington.
Travis: C'mon, note-taker.
Taliesin: Show him your tattoo, I'm just sort of curious. I just had a thought.
Liam: My tattoo? What? The Slayer's Take?
Taliesin: --the Clasp.
Liam: That's a fucking Keyleth palm at this point.
Marisha: I removed it.
Taliesin: You did?
Laura: Oh...
Marisha: I burnt it off of him.
Taliesin: You're gonna make me draw it? That's fine. I'm doing the Clasp logo, if I-- Does this look at all familiar? I have the Clasp logo.
Matt: Yeah, it does not.
Marisha: Hashtag Clasp.
Taliesin: Hashtag Clasp.
Marisha: Interesting.
Sam: No. You're all literate? You can read and write?
Taliesin: Most of us, yes.
Sam: Wow. I haven't met many of you in my travels that have--
Taliesin: We even have a library.
Sam: That's amazing.
Laura: Big one.
Liam: Yeah, I mean, he's particularly brainy. You guys have a lot in common.
Taliesin: We have quite a nice library.
Liam: I mean, there's a lot of differences between the two of you, but you have a lot in common.
Sam: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Horrifyingly, yes.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, I was a bit of a reader growing up.
Sam: Oh?
Taliesin: Yes. Fiction and non-fiction. A bit of everything. I was a--
Sam: Perhaps we can compare books later?
Taliesin: I will happily show you my library.
Liam: Huh.
Sam: This guy-- This excites me.
Taliesin: Stop. Stop smiling at that.
Liam: You can teach him the art of nerd chic, Percy.
Taliesin: He seems to be well-built for it.
Marisha: You know, Percy is a bit of a tinkerer himself as well.
Taliesin: I do... Yeah.
Sam: Really?
Taliesin: Yes. Yes, I've built a few things.
Sam: That piece of equipment you showed to that weirdo earlier today-- the thing with the handle?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: Did you make that?
Taliesin: I didn't make that, but I did make this one. And I pull down the folded ridiculous--
Matt: Bad News contraption?
Taliesin: Bad News.
Taliesin: Um, yeah.
Laura: I keep filling up Grog's mug, to make sure he gets his fill.
Sam: What does that-- What does that do?
Taliesin: It takes these-- and I pull out a musket ball-- and it fires them at great speed. In whatever direction I like.
Sam: That is--
Taliesin: Very dangerous--
Sam: Sexy.
Taliesin: Thank you. It's very dangerous.
Sam: It's very sexy.
Taliesin: Thank you. I think so.
Sam: Wow. And did you make this by yourself?
Taliesin: I did. This took about six months? Seven months? I mean, I'd been thinking about it for quite a while. I'm working on a few others, too--
Sam: Wow.
Liam: Oh, I didn't know that.
Taliesin: This is kind of the definitive-- Yes, this is when we were all--
Marisha: Built it on our little summer vacation.
Taliesin: -- on the last time we took a break.
Sam: Is the propellant part of this piece right here? Or is it in that big piece right there?
Taliesin: Ah, neither. It's in this--
Sam: Or is it magical?
Taliesin: No, it's not magical at all. Everything in this is purely physical. No magic involved whatsoever.
Sam: Oh...
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Wow.
Liam: What do you make of all this?
Sam: That's impressive.
Laura: Huh?
Taliesin: Showing the mechanism off.
Liam: I don't know-- nerd talk?
Laura: I think it's great.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Uh-huh.
Liam: What do you think of the new guy?
Laura: Oh, yeah. He's weird? I don't know.
Liam: I mean, he's not Scanlan.
Laura: No.
Liam: No.
Laura: Nobody is.
Sam: Oh, you know what? I'm sorry. One second. I forgot, I owe you some money, don't I?
Laura: Yes you do.
Sam: The adventure was 50 thousand, correct?
Laura: Yes, it was.
Sam: I think I had a good adventure today. But I didn't die. So, minus the Prismatic Spray, that's 6000 gold taken off. Minus the wear and tear on my armor and equipment, that's another 5000 taken off.
Laura: Darling, this wasn't part of the deal.
Sam: Minus the fact that I wasn't the star of the adventure, I'll halve the rest of it. Do you have a tax ID or some sort of tax-exempt status?
Liam: Wait, you need to be the lead character in your death-taunting? Is that what you're telling us?
Sam: I'm just trying to find out how much I actually owe you.
Laura: No contract stipulations when we made the deal, therefore, you pay full price, darling.
Sam: I am a man of business and I always follow the law. So by my calculations, 20% federal taxes, 9.5% local and city taxes, I put that at about 11,000 gold total left still. Doty?
Taliesin: Technically, she is tax-exempt.
Sam: Write a check.
Laura: A check?
Sam: Of course.
Taliesin: She is tax-exempt.
Sam: How is she tax-exempt?
Taliesin: She's a baroness.
Sam: Make it 16.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: My father will pay that. In full.
Laura: Oh, dear lord.
Taliesin: We can put it in the treasury, technically.
Marisha: Did he just give us an IOU?
Travis: What about all the jingly-jangly in your bag of holding?
Sam: Go on and reach in there.
Laura: I know how bags of holding work.
Travis: I'll just stick my hand in the bag of holding.
Matt: It is empty. What are you thinking of while you reach in there?
Travis: Candy. (all laugh)
Matt: Does he find candy?
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Nope. It's just a void, an empty sack.
Travis: This is bullshit! You can't come with us.
Sam: Is he holding any equipment or weapons?
Matt: The weapon is near him, but not currently on him.
Sam: Okay. Fire. And I set his weapon on fire.
Matt: You watch as your hammer just ignites with flame.
Travis: You better put that out.
Sam: It's cool, though, right?
Travis: You burning my hammer?
Sam: No, no, it's magical, it's good. It helps!
Travis: I touch it.
Matt: It burns your hand. (all laugh)
Sam: Why would you touch a flame?
Travis: Because you said it was magical!
Sam: (whispers) Is he an idiot?
Taliesin: Well... I don't feel like I can answer that question appropriately at the moment.
Marisha: Legally? Maybe?
Travis: You know when people poke you in the sternum with their finger? I do that with the Titanstone Knuckle really hard.
Matt: Yeah, it hurts.
Taliesin: I pour more wine for him. More wine. More wine.
Sam: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just getting used to this.
Taliesin: No, you're fitting in very well.
Travis: You have your strengths, and while you may be able to "read" with your friends over there, I think it's also important to work on your weaknesses.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Yeah, so we gotta work on your bravery, maybe your fighting voice.
Sam: Absolutely.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Was it really bad? Did I sound okay?
Laura: No, I mean, I wasn't there to witness it, I just know your normal voice.
Travis: When you were flying over the city, did it sound like a llama being mauled by a pack of wolves?
Laura: I heard this braying. I thought it was a goat, actually.
Travis: That was him.
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: What a picture you just painted. That was lovely.
Travis: Yeah. Big tall neck, all furry.
Taliesin: No, I heard the llama.
Liam: I'm gonna squish in next to him and put my arm around with an ale and say, I don't know why I am suddenly taking a shine to you when I felt like I hated you a couple hours ago. Just stick with us. You don't have to know-- I hear everything you're saying. You're an asshole, and I love you, but you really are an asshole. I'm just talking to the guy. I have taken a shine to you, and I'm gonna look out for you, all right? The first time I got attacked I was a fucking mess. I'm still a fucking mess. That's the thing, people are writing stories about us, we're a bunch of fucking shitheads, and nobody talks about that-- maybe a few people do.
Taliesin: A few people do talk about that.
Liam: A few people do talk about that.
Marisha: I think more than a few.
Laura: A lot of people talk about that.
Liam: There's no way to prepare, you just have to hit your face against the wall a couple of times, then it starts to feel normal-ish.
Travis: I can help you with that.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Thank you.
Liam: You're good, you've done it, you've been hazed, you're good, kid.
Sam: I am so appreciative of all of you, and I will repay this debt, I promise you. I will make you guest-stars in one chapter of my book, and it will be top three most epic chapters.
Liam: That's pretty cool.
Laura: Fabulous.
Taliesin: Is the money that you're paying us with your father's money as well? Please be honest.
Sam: Yes, absolutely.
Taliesin: That's fabulous.
Laura: Oh, I like that.
Taliesin: That makes everything even better. We'll get you a room right next to the library so you can have easy access.
Sam: Thank you.
Taliesin: We can set that up right away.
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: The doors don't lock, though, so you have to be on guard all night long. Training is a 24-hour regimen around here.
Sam: All right. I accept your conditions.
Taliesin: I'll give you access to the workshop if you feel like building yourself a lock. Feel free.
Sam: You have a workshop?
Taliesin: Oh, my.
Sam: For tinkering?
Taliesin: Oh, my.
Sam: Ooh, I like you.
Taliesin: Yes, it's my pleasure. It's so nice. Of course, you'll have a tour. In the morning, we'll do a brief tour.
Sam: Absolutely. And I could show you the inner workings of Doty.
Taliesin: I would be so delighted.
Sam: It's pretty outstanding if I do say so myself.
Taliesin: It's very good work, I'm very impressed.
Sam: Little bit of luck, little bit of magic.
Marisha: Do you want us to excuse the two of you?
Matt: The two of them, as you guys are having this conversation, without realizing it, slowly exit together.
Taliesin: I'm not leaving.
Matt: Right, then you stop yourself as you reach the door.
Taliesin: I'm gonna send him to the library at the very least.
Matt: Okay, the waitstaff come in and retrieve your belongings and lead you up to the chamber that'll be prepared for your evening.
Sam: Good evening. Bye.
Laura: Bidet.
Liam: Good night, Tary, good night. Oh, boy. What a babe in the woods.
Taliesin: I kind of like him.
Laura: Grog, how ragey are you right now?
Travis: Pretty ragey, yeah.
Laura: Super ragey?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: All the people who tend not to like people are liking him.
Taliesin: It's a terrible sign, isn't it? Just really, really disturbing.
Marisha: I feel like the two of you never like the same person.
Taliesin: No, that's weird.
Liam: You know, we don't have the weight of the world crushing us at the moment, so I feel like that might have something to do with it, yeah.
Laura: It feels very strange for you two to be agreeing.
Taliesin: It does. It makes me want to take risks. It's nice.
Marisha: I thought we were taking a break from risk-taking for a second.
Taliesin: No, I feel like we've been playing it very safe, it's just been that the world has been taking risks.
Marisha: I love the way you frame things, Percy.
Liam: Once again you're a couple steps ahead of us.
Marisha: I love the way you lawyer your way out of every situation.
Taliesin: That's so nice.
Liam: I wonder where Scanlan is.
Marisha: I could check in on him. Haven't used the scrying eye today.
Taliesin: I wanna say let's give him some privacy, but at the same time I do kind of want to see him.
Laura: I just want to know if he's all right.
Travis: I don't.
Marisha: I'm gonna look. I take out the scrying eye.
Travis: Don't.
Marisha: What? Why?
Liam: I walk over to Grog and start playing-- what was it? Rock, paper, what was it?
Marisha: Boulder, parchment, shears.
Taliesin: Paper, shears or parchment, shears?
Sam: It should be parchment, shears.
Laura: It should be parchment, shears.
Liam: Trying to teach Grog that game.
Travis: No. Stop.
Liam: No?
Travis: I don't want you to look in on him.
Taliesin: I think I'm done for the evening.
Marisha: Why? We just want to make sure he's okay.
Travis: Because he asked us for his own time. Can we respect that or not? Or did you want him to yell at you more when we see him again?
Marisha: He can't know if I'm scrying on him.
Taliesin: He might know if you're scrying on him.
Laura: He might know.
Marisha: Not if I use my scrying eye.
Taliesin: Let's give him a little bit of time.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: Thank you, Grog. That's a very fair point.
Travis: Okay, now I'll play.
Taliesin: Little elf girl?
Laura: Danger-zone. I swear.
Taliesin: Is it a danger zone?
Laura: Mm.
Taliesin: Because, you know, it occurs to me, I've never given you a full tour of the treasury room, have I?
Laura: Um. Why, no, Percival.
Taliesin: I'm grabbing the wine and I'm leaving right now.
Sam: You guys are gonna fuck in the treasury? Oh my god! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Who has never wanted to have the full Scrooge McDuck? For fuck's sake. (all laugh)
Laura: As we leave, I turn to Grog. And I think about talking to him for just a second, and then I leave the room.
Taliesin: I owe you for that shit. Thank you.
Matt: All right. As the rest of you wind down the evening, drinking, perusing the treasury, reading the various books that are at your disposal--
Taliesin: We do deposit the check at the treasury, by the way, while we're there.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Deposit the checks.
Matt: You find your evening to a close.
Marisha: We haven't had the night off in a while.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: You enjoy the time to relax a bit and take another breath of air after this constant pressure that's been pushing you. Next morning comes in as the sun rises, you all come to consciousness, rouse yourselves for breakfast, and whatever the next day ensues. You all begin to gather in the common room of the castle once more.
Travis: We all healed up?
Taliesin: All healed up.
Matt: Yep, all healed up.
Taliesin: Airship or sea ship? This is your call.
Travis: We've never done a sea ship.
Liam: Yeah, I think we've got some-- We could go after the dude in hell, but I think we have some more time.
Laura: Pike asked us not to.
Taliesin: We should bring a Pike to hell.
Marisha: Pike wants to go.
Liam: I agree, I agree. So..
Marisha: All right.
Travis: Time to go finish your Atari. (all laugh)
Taliesin: We have twenty six hundred men in the back.
Marisha: All right. Do I know roughly where the water ashari are?
Matt: You vaguely know that it exists somewhere in the Ozmit Sea. Kind of south-ish from Tal'Dorei. But you don't really know. Maybe a little bit of information-gathering, or asking people who may traverse that area would help you, but you don't really know.
Laura: Yeah, we can go down to the docks. Are there docks here?
Marisha: Not in Whitestone. I think we're pretty landlocked.
Matt: Pretty landlocked in Whitest--
Taliesin: No. There is actually, technically there's the sea to the north, but that would be useless.
Sam: She meant the doctor's office.
Matt: Yeah, you have the Lucidian Ocean to the east of you.
Taliesin: Mm-hm.
Matt: But it is a very treacherous water, and the Shearing Channel, that is the series of broken land mass between here and Wildmount, the one that the Briarwoods were brokering the bridge for, is-- yeah.
Taliesin: There's a reason we're not a poor city.
Marisha: Is there like a port at the very south end of the continent, to where we could hop a ship and also do some research?
Matt: Uh, there's Stillben, very very far south.
Liam: Ooh.
Marisha: Stillben?
Matt: But that is still out to the Lucidian Ocean, east. The Ozmit Sea is on the western side of the continent. Emon is the closest port city to head to the Ozmit Sea.
Marisha: Oh, western. Oh you mean western. Okay well then, hang on. If it's w-- Nope.
Taliesin: Oh, I was about to say, who has the map? You have the map. Okay.
Laura: Yeah, it would be Emon.
Marisha: 'Cause the Earth Ashari are on the eastern side of the continent. Right?
Taliesin: Do you have a map?
Matt: The Earth Ashari are kind of northern, like mid-northern of the continent. They're in the Cliffkeep Mountains.
Taliesin: This is a conversation that is happening right now. I'm so amused.
Matt: Yes it is.
Taliesin: We're trying to remember the fake geography--
Marisha: Of our fake world--
Taliesin: Of our fantasy world.
Matt: Ask me, it's been my life for the past year. Writing all this down for a book for all you guys.
Sam: I got it.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: So Emon is like--
Sam: We're up here.
Laura: Yeah, Emon is the place to go to.
Liam: Thanks, Matt.
Laura: Thanks, Matt.
Taliesin: Yeah, yeah. We're up here. Whitestone's here.
Sam: Yeah.
Taliesin: And we need to be the south-west, so--
Liam: We will live in the stars.
Taliesin: Emon's here. Emon is the biggest port city on the Ozmit Sea, isn't it?
Matt: Uh, on this continent? Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's--
Marisha: So we might as well leave out of Emon.
Taliesin: We might as well leave out of Emon.
Marisha: And then I could also do some research, because-- Is the libraries and the lyceums and stuff open again? Or are they just fucking demolished?
Matt: You don't know. I mean, a lot of that part of the town is just now being rebuilt and recovered so--
Taliesin: Where's the airship by the way, as well?
Matt: You have not checked in on the airship. You guys--
Taliesin: When was the last time we saw them?
Matt: The last time you saw them was in the throes of the battle with Thordak, when they came in and gave it a helping hand briefly.
Laura: Did they come back here?
Sam: Just to keep up the audience  We're in Maine, and we're trying to get to Los Angeles.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Well-put.
Sam: As Taryon, can't we teleport to wherever we're trying to go?
Taliesin: It's easier to teleport if you're already been there.
Sam: Ooh.
Marisha: Yeah, unfortunately, I can't-- I've never been there. And the Ashari are a very reclusive type people.
Sam: I've read about most people and places.
Marisha: Have you read about the Water Ashari and the Ashari people?
Matt: Make a history check.
Laura: Ooh!
Taliesin: I'm gonna join in on this history check as well.
Sam: Yeah, that's a one.
Taliesin: Wow.
Sam: Her eyes just intimidate me.
Marisha: (whispering) Sam.
Laura: Shame you.
Liam: Shame! Shame!
Taliesin: (singing) No one knows what it's like, to be a bad man. Okay.
Marisha: Do you wanna touch my antlers?
Taliesin: Hey now.
Marisha: Ignore that, that got weird.
Taliesin: That got real weird. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I'm gonna join in on a terrible history check. That is a 19. It's not terrible, I just had a very high history.
Matt: It's not terrible, but your research hasn't delved too deeply into the Ashari. And the Ashari that you do know of are the Terra and uh, and the Air Ashari.
Taliesin: Yeah, I've only got what I read at home.
Matt: There's the Terra and the Zephra. Those are the only two you know about. Those are the only two on the continent. The Vesrah you're not too familiar with.
Taliesin: Well, who else can we talk to?
Marisha: I mean, I guess I could always go back to the Earth Ashari, or the Air Ashari, and talk to some of those people.
Laura: Maybe somebody at the docks in Emon would know?
Taliesin: She really wants to go to the docks in Emon.
Laura: I wanna just pay off that docks comment, really. (all laugh)
Sam: Worth it.
Taliesin: Magic.
Marisha: I don't know. I guess we could go back and talk to the Earth Ashari. You guys haven't been there yet.
Laura: Let's go!
Taliesin: Let's go to the Earth Ashari.
Marisha: Yeah, all right.
Taliesin: Let's collect our things. What's the temperature like there?
Laura: Ooh.
Marisha: Right now, with it being the Season of-
Taliesin: The witch.
Matt: It's in essentially a heavy valley of stone in the center of the Cliffkeep Mountain range. It is far from civilization, it's maybe a few days of heavy mountain-- constant hiking north of where Kraghammer is.
Marisha: Oh. We'd have to hike to get there? No, there's gotta be trees that I can Tree Stride there to.
Matt: There are a couple that aren't too far outside of Terra that you can Tree Stride to.
Marisha: We're druids, there's gotta be trees within that camp, right? And stuff?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Like, nearby?
Matt: Yes, I'm saying that there are some that are like, just in the outskirts of Terra, none directly in it.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Oh shit! Okay, no. Nothing. I had resistance to something and I forgot to use it. (all laugh)
Travis: Resistance to a beating?
Sam: Yeah. Would not have helped me very much.
Taliesin: Let's also say, as we're getting ready, I'm gonna take Tary down and let him pick through the tinkering room, see if he needs any tools and upgrade anything that he might need, give him a quick tour.
Laura: And I wanna talk to Grog.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: (whispered) I'll take everything.
Matt: So as you guys are taking through the--
Taliesin: Showing him the equipment.
Matt: You find Grog off to the side.
Taliesin: Don't touch that.
Laura: How are you?
Travis: Me?
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: I'm good. I slept really well.
Laura: Yeah. Feeling less rage-y?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: That's good, that's good. Okay. Hey, so... This is difficult for me to do. Did you know that Scanlan had acquired drugs?
Travis: No?
Laura: Did you?
Travis: No.
Laura: I just found this out, that he was using drugs behind our back.
Travis: Like bad drugs?
Laura: I think so, I mean, I've never tried them, but--
Travis: Me neither.
Laura: So, I don't know, finding out secrets about people doesn't feel good. Feeling like they've broken your trust in some way, right? And being trustworthy is very important.
Travis: Right, yeah, I think that's very important.
Laura: Right. So. Just hold on.
Travis: I'm not even fighting anyone right now.
Laura: Ah. I pull out the deck. So, this is-- Do you know what this is? Do you remember this?
Travis: Where did you find one?
Laura: Okay. So, Grog, I have to be honest with you. When you asked me for this before, I lied. To you.
Travis: You lied?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: What do you mean?
Laura: Well, I sort of tricked you and thought it'd be funny if I gave you maybe the wrong thing. To see if you'd notice! But-- I'm still lying. I didn't-- I was afraid-- I gave you a false deck.
Travis: No, no, you gave it to me, it's in my bag.
Laura: You wanna pull it out?
Travis: But you said I wasn't supposed to look at it.
Laura: Well, you're still not supposed to, technically. Do you want me to pull it out?
Travis: Phrasing. (all laugh)
Laura: Should I-- Should you-- Do you just--
Travis: You want me to get the deck out?
Laura: Yeah, maybe close your eyes and get the deck out. (all laugh)
Travis: All right, I got it.
Laura: All right, I am taking it from your hand.
Travis: But these are mine!
Laura: These ones are--
Travis: Don't take them from me again!
Laura: Grog! Open your eyes. It's not really a deck, you see? It's a bag. With rocks in it.
Travis: Did you take my salt lick rock?
Laura: No. You gave that to Scanlan. Here's your deck. Still don't use it, still don't look at it, it's still very dangerous! But I want you to know that I trust you with it.
Travis: I know. You said, "Don't look at it," and I haven't looked at it.
Laura: Oh, good, then still don't, how about that?
Travis: I'm very confused. (all laugh)
Laura: I know, basically, I just--
Travis: Do you want a card?
Laura: No! I don't know.
Travis: I open the flap--
Laura: No no no! Don't-- Grog!
Travis: Do you want a card? What're you worried about, it's a deck of cards.
Laura: You're making me regret giving this back to you right now. I just want to say. I close it. Please don't make me regret this.
Travis: Why?
Laura: I'm sorry that I lied to you. Even though you didn't notice. I want you to know you can still trust me, and I can still trust you to not fuck with this.
Travis: I would like to insight check Vex.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Liam: (laughing) I love you guys.
Travis: Six. (all laugh)
Matt: It's a lot of words. It's a lot of words. But you got your deck back.
Travis: But I always had it.
Matt: You-- It's really confusing. She's talking at you, but nothing changed.
Travis: Is this a lesson?
Laura: Sure.
Travis: Can we just skip to the part where you get so frustrated that I haven't got it and you just tell me the answer anyway?
Laura: Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: You're a good person. Still don't look at the deck. I'm glad you have our back. Don't do drugs.
Travis: What do you think Scanlan did with the rest of those drugs?
Laura: What do you mean 'the rest of the drugs'?
Travis: Well, you said he was doing drugs, right?
Laura: Right.
Travis: Well, did he just take them with him?
Laura: Should we search his room?
Travis: Ooh, maybe!
Laura: Let's do it.
Travis: All right, I put the deck away.
Matt: Okay. You guys head up to Scanlan's room.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Both you guys make investigation checks.
Liam: You've done a lot of brilliant things. That was the most brilliant thing you have ever done.
Taliesin: I am so consistently proud of you.
Liam: Oh my god.
Travis: 16. 18 minus two.
Laura: Oh! 16 for me as well.
Travis: Hey!
Laura: Hey!
Matt: Together you both see-- You both spend the better part of an hour thumbing through the various drawers and odd boxes and sundries that were left behind in the wake of Scanlan's departure. And at the same time you both come to find that, no, there are-- no illegal substances remain.
Laura: He took them with him!
Travis: What about nudey pictures?
Laura: Oh, nudey pictures.
Taliesin: Other things, what else is in the room?
Matt: Honestly? There are no nudey pictures, per se.
Travis: Boring.
Matt: You do find a series of books on art and the human physique.
Travis: Ugh.
Matt: And all the corresponding images have been torn out.
Laura: (laughs) Yeah.
Travis: Damn it.
Sam: I have magic that can make things that are way more real than a drawing.
Taliesin: He has three original print issues of Cherry Comics number one through four.
Travis: Well, there's no drugs.
Laura: Well, I guess he took them with him.
Travis: All right. When do I get to look at the cards?
Laura: Like, never, Grog.
Travis: Like, never never? Never, never?
Laura: Well, I heard from Percival that they're super, super dangerous. But I don't know what they do.
Travis: Yeah, you don't.
Laura: No, I don't.
Travis: Only one way to find out! Not today.
Laura: Not today, how about that?
Travis: Fair enough.
Laura: All right.
Matt: All right. You've joined the rest of the party, the rest of-- After you guys finish your perusal of the workshop, which is quite a workshop, mundane in a lot of ways, but functional for the basic purposes of tinkering.
Taliesin: Rustic!
Matt: Rustic.
Taliesin: Rustic.
Sam: I think it's magnificent, what you've put together here.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: And I'm impressed, and from me that's quite a compliment.
Taliesin: No, I'm feeling it. And, my workshop, obviously, is your workshop for as long as you stay here. Anything you need to work on, of course, it's fully available.
Sam: You know what? I don't normally do this, but... What's your name? (all laugh)
Marisha: Oh my god. He doesn't know any of our names!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: We're like a bad speed dating session. Holy shit.
Taliesin: This is so amazing. Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo the third. At your service.
Marisha: Oooh! He's still got it!
Sam: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo the third. All right.
Taliesin: Percy to my friends.
Sam: I'm Tary to mine.
Taliesin: Tary, it's a pleasure. This is the castle I live in, this is my sister's castle, except of course, she's lovely. Cassandra de Rolo.
Sam: Hm.
Taliesin: You are in Whitestone, as our guest.
Sam: It is my honor and privilege to be your guest, sir.
Taliesin: A pleasure. I recommend eventually, not necessarily today 'cause I am actually enjoying it, learning everyone else's name as well.
Sam: All right, well. Okay. (all laugh)
Sam: Let's Tary-on! No? Maybe?
Taliesin: No it's-- I'm okay with it, I'm rolling with it.
Marisha: No! No.
Sam: Doty! Doty, put it as a maybe.
Marisha: Not becoming a catchphrase.
Taliesin: It's not a catchphrase.
Sam: Doty, put it as a maybe for catchphrases.
Matt: You guys gather up--
Taliesin: Another daring rescue.
Matt: Together, prepare yourselves for what the next step of your journey is. What are you doing?
Marisha: Are we going? Are we going?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Going, going, gone, gotta go?
Taliesin: Got your stuff together? Everything you need?
Laura: Are we going to Emon? No. We're going to the earth-- the earth people.
Marisha: Got everything. Earth people first.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So we can be like, where do I find the other fourth of my tribe.
Taliesin: You've written your camp number. In pen, on your arm.
Marisha: Yes, I've got my safety tags.
Taliesin: You've got your safety tags.
Marisha: I'm good. I'm good.
Taliesin: You've got your rights written on the back, so that, y'know. If anyone tries to--
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: Let's do it, let's--
Marisha: All right, let's go.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Respect. Respect the antlers.
Liam: Always have.
Taliesin: We decorated them at the last winter festival.
Marisha: I like decorating my antlers.
Taliesin: And it looked quite nice.
Marisha: It's a traditional Ashari tradition.
Liam: All right. Eyes on the prize.
Laura: Let's go!
Matt: (laughs) You guys find your way to the Sun Tree. Utilizing Transport via Plants you find yourself (teleportation sound) thrust through the trunk of the Sun Tree, and emerging on the opposite side, on the cusp of a deep bowl-like valley that goes probably for a good mile and a half, or two miles across, before you reach the other side of this crest.
Liam: Tary! That's two times! You've teleported two times.
Sam: (gasps) Oh my god, every time it's amazing. Wow, thank you. Thank you all. Where are we?
Taliesin: Uh.
Marisha: Well.
Matt: Central Cliffkeep.
Marisha: We are in the central Cliffkeep
Sam: Of?
Marisha: Of Tal'Dorei. And of the central-- Of the Cliffkeep Mountains.
Sam: So cool.
Marisha: Yeah! (all laugh)
Matt: You glance around, and there are the edges of a forest here. A lot of them are stockier trees, and things that live in harsh environments, and a lot of them are rooted in cracks in the ground, and portions of the rock that have split open. Down within this valley, you can already see what appear to be dozens and dozens of trenches, that seem to have been dug. And there are areas of this valley that appear to have eroded or collapsed. Like small, long rockslides that are just kind of dotting the edges of the mountain walls. Down towards the center you can see, also, a cluster of dozens and dozens of small abodes, it looks like. Homes, huts, structures made of rock. This is Terra, this is the Earth Ashari village here. Currently guarding over the localized rift to the Earth Elemental plane. You guys are traversing down into it?
Marisha: Yep
Matt: It takes you a short time, you find one of the paths that kinda zigzags down the side of this mountain drop, and make your way in towards the center. The sun is now-- I'd say at this time, just over the very top, kind of noon-ish portion of the day. You begin to walk your way in and it's very warm here, partially because the-- It's northern enough where usually it's a colder temperature on the island-- Don't you even, you motherfucker.
Liam: Wow. You lasered in on that like nobody's business!
Travis: (gunshots)
Matt: I'm a little sensitive (all laugh)
Matt: But the further down you get it is just-- The tree line has stopped and it is just rock, stone, that is reflecting the light and it is warm. You're starting to find yourself sweat in your full armor as you traverse deeper and deeper into the center of this mountain valley.
Marisha: It's always like 20 degrees warmer in the valley.
Laura: (laughs) Terrible.
Matt: Disadvantage on the next roll. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Thank you for turning us into an episode of California, yes.
Liam: That's a little bit of Los Angeles actor humor for you guys over in Sweden today.
Travis: (surfer accent) Californians.
Taliesin: To get to Critical Role, take the 101 with the 5 to get up to Burbank to get to Critical Role.
Liam: For all you fans in Germany, that's a little San Fernando valley humor!
Taliesin: From beautiful downtown Burbank.
Sam: I loved it, you can do no wrong.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Exactly.
Marisha: I like Tary.
Matt: Yeah. So as you continue downward, you get maybe a quarter-mile into this walk, still relatively far from the village, before-- And you recognize this. You watch as one of the nearby trenches, (earth moving) shifts up about two feet in stone, and you watch as three figures step out from within the trench and begin walking towards you.
Travis: Are we killing these?
Marisha: Stop-- No, no? These are-- Grog!
Travis: Sorry, but--
Taliesin: They're sending us to the things we're going to kill.
Travis: Oh! Okay.
Marisha: Everyone, wait for a second. I step forward a second.
Matt: Okay. You watch as three humanoids approach.
Travis: Lambchop-looking motherfucker.
Sam: Just a stick. Just a stick. It doesn't do anything.
Taliesin: It's from the walking company.
Matt: They are clad in darkened leathers, furs, and it looks like a lot of the armor and garb here is taken from hunted creatures and animals that have been prepared and tanned, here within the sun-wracked center of this mountain valley. The two to the-- Flanking the central figure appear to be human, male and female, both very short, kind of tossed hair. Then at the center you see what appears to be a surprisingly short, but very stocky and thick, half orc female. As she approaches she has-- the hair is woven back into these thick braids that are pulled into a singular, what looks like a topknot, on the upper back of her skull. Her jaw protrudes a bit, you can see the two lower fangs kinda pushing past the lips.
Marisha: Is this Patisse?
Matt: No, this is--
Travis: Lower fangs?
Laura: She's a half orc.
Liam: Yeah, she's got the big teeth.
Matt: This is Rockcaller Dryden.
Laura: Rockcaller--?
Matt: Dryden.
Laura: Not that I would know that.
Liam: (sing-song) Rock Caller Dryden
Sam: Good old RCD.
Marisha: Do I know Dryden from before?
Matt: You do.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: This is not the headmaster of the tribe,
Marisha: Right.
Matt: But one of the central sentinels that's around this portion here.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: Approaches you, and for a moment puts a hand out almost to hail you, and then recognizes your face and steps forward. "Keyleth? What brings you to Terra?"
Marisha: Kaitiaki, Dryden.
Matt: Kaitiaki.
Marisha: How are you?
Matt: We are well.
Marisha: Have you fared well here recently, in the past several months?
Matt: We have hunkered down. Our business was to make sure that no more of the Rifts befall the same fate of the Pyrah.
Marisha: Have you talked to Cerkonos or Korren at all?
Matt: Not recently, no.
Marisha: We have slayed the Chroma Conclave. All the dragons are dead.
Matt: Then this is a time for celebration.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: I will pass this along.
Marisha: I was wondering if I could speak to Headmaster Patisse.
Matt: Perhaps, but what do you wish to speak on?
Marisha: I am intent on continuing my journey on to the Water Ashari tribe. And I need information from him.
Matt: To the Vesrah. Very well. I could help you with this information if need be.
Marisha: Is Patisse indisposed?
Matt: No. No, right this way.
Marisha: I mean it would just be nice to, like, say hi. While I'm here at least.
Matt: "Very well." They turn around and begin to lead you back towards the outskirts of the city, not directly into Terra itself, but as you approach, and walk past, you can see the ground here-- every ten minutes or so you feel a sudden shift, and a slight quake beneath your feet. The landscape here, the closer you walk to the center of the village, seems to be in this perpetual state of shifting rock. And you watch as different areas kind of collide. Areas of stone kind of (cracking noise), and rocks tumble down. Parts of it break and crack and reform. At one point, as you guys are not maybe 200 feet out from the first major structures, the ground has one major spike. (loud rock slide) And you hear this heavy rolling rumble, and you watch as, maybe 300 feet off from the side, a new pinnacle is formed. Two big plates kind of (crack), jut upward, one kind of coasting over the other and coming to a halt. There is very heavy localized seismic activity as part of the proximity to the rift of the earth elemental plane here. And you watch as three druids come rushing out of the side of the Terra tribe, and as they focus, the rocks (crumbling noises) crumble back down and subside. The central mountain landscape, here, brought back to a momentary beat of peace and quiet.
Marisha: I'm like a New Yorker on a subway.
Matt: Yeah. Just going straight in.
Marisha: I'm just like, whatever. Used to this.
Laura: Must wreak havoc on the local architexture.
Travis: Architexture?
Laura: Architexture.
Marisha: Oh, it's built-- We've got infrastructure built for that sort of thing. It's fine, they're used to it here.
Matt: Right. As you progress inward, and some of the other Terra Ashari--
Laura: Shut your mouth, you wouldn't even know what architecture is!
Matt: Different visual representations. Some appear to be more ornamental. Jewelry seems to be here, like jewels and metallics used, it seems to connote a level of prestige within the tribe, and every individual that walks, usually with a cluster or protectors around them, or at least, seems to be in a place of notable importance within groups, seems to be more adorned in this natural-based jewelry. You know exactly where to go to head straight to the hut in which the headmaster resides and as--
Liam: And I'm watching her stride through here with confidence, just impressed.
Marisha: Rockcaller. Rockcaller. Oh Jerry! How you been? How's the kids?
Liam: Jerry! Jerry!
Marisha: Jerry! JERRY!
Matt: What looks to be a heavy wooden doorway, built out of a series of tree trunks that are strapped to this one area. Just (tree trunks shifting) shifts open and now you see, walks a very tall, thin, and older, like mid-60s human male, who is adorned in a similar tattoo pattern as the Rockcaller you saw earlier. But it seems to reside from the center of the cheeks and through the jowls and then crosses across the neck and then across the arms all the way down to the fingertips.
Laura: (quietly) Tight.
Matt: And there are certain portions which are broken up by hard lines, it's like this parallel intersection multiple times as the tattoo progresses down. Very, very loose, almost a flowing central shoulder-based robe that tosses down the front of the body and meets with a long skirt that drags behind him as he steps out. And as he looks over in the direction of you, you can see the eyes are very hardened, dark, deep brown in color, and the sockets are very weathered, his skin texture in general is pretty weathered. He looks over towards you, clean-shaven, short white hair, puts a hand up. "Keyleth, you grace the Terra with your presence. What can we be of service to you for?"
Marisha: I stand more in attention, more formal. Good to see you, Patisse, it's been quite some time.
Matt: You as well.
Marisha: I just came to check in after the recent events in the world, make sure everyone was okay.
Matt: Everything seems to be fine. We've been intent of care to the rift, and from the word that seems to have passed quickly since your arrival over the past few days, it's come to our attention that Thordak no longer sits in the center of the city of Emon.
Marisha: That's correct. We've also slain his right-hand man, Raishan, who seemed to be the mastermind of the entire orchestration.
Matt: Good. Good and well done.
Marisha: Thank you. I couldn't have done it without your help and training, so I appreciate that.
Matt: You are but a seed, you allowed it to germinate. So what do you need?
Marisha: Well, I'm intent on continuing on with my Aramente now that there's relative peace in the world. The Vesrah people are quite insular, of course. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to get there and any advice in general on dealing with them?
Matt: It has been a long time since I've attended any sort of gathering with the Vesrah. It is for people of our skill set not the easiest of journeys, as many of us are capable of traversing through the sentinels of nature. Unfortunately, most of the tree life that exists around Vesrah is beneath the water.
Marisha: Right.
Matt: So your most likely form of transport will be that of a vessel across the waves.
Marisha: Who's their headmaster there now? Do you know?
Matt: The headmaster there-- Uvenda, the heart of the tides.
Marisha: Uvenda.
Matt: Uvenda.
Marisha: Uvenda, the heart of the tides. What can I expect of this Uvenda? Uvenda.
Matt: Not what you'd expect. I'll leave it at that.
Marisha: That's very vague of you, Patisse.
Matt: Well, what would be the fun if I were to unveil the next fold of your Aramente?
Marisha: No, you've got a point. Do you recommend by ship or would flight be more appropriate?
Matt: If you have the means, that is up to you.
Marisha: All right. Any other words of encouragement?
Matt: Listen closely. Keep your friends about you. That should be sufficient.
Marisha: Oh, sorry, I probably should've introduced-- by the way, this is my band I've been traveling with, Vox Machina. And Tary. Tary Darrington.
Sam: Lovely to meet you. I have no idea where we are right now.
Matt: Good, keep it that way.
Marisha: He's new.
Laura: Can I ask a question? Is that all right?
Marisha: Of course.
Laura: Is it polite?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: (quietly) Hi, sorry. You mentioned that the water Ashari live under the water.
Matt: They don't live beneath the water, not entirely.
Laura: Okay, I thought maybe they were like mer-people or something, I wasn't sure.
Marisha: That would be awesome.
Laura: Yeah, right? That'd be really cool.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Cool. So we'll see them above land then if we're flying.
Matt: Some of them, yes.
Laura: Some of them. All right, that was my question. Thank you for your answer. Thank you.
Marisha: Are there any other landmarks or ways of navigation to find them? They're an island in the middle of the Ozmit sea.
Matt: It's not the island of usual appearance. The beaches and sands of Vesrah are built upon a great circular reef. And part of the city lies above, part of it lies below.
Travis: (quietly) Sick.
Marisha: (quietly) Awesome.
Matt: Look for the white sands beneath the surface. Some structures will be visible from above. It would lie quite a ways to the southwest, not too far from the Hespit. I would recommend perhaps procuring the service of someone who knows the sea well.
Marisha: Yes. We were going to look into trying to do that. Well, is there anything you need from me, Patisse, before we head on?
Matt: No. Just do your best to have your friends keep the location of our village to themselves.
Marisha: Don't worry, we have many places we'd prefer to keep this way.
Matt: Good. I trust you all. Safe journeys. Keep her safe.
Taliesin: Of course.
Laura: Always.
Matt: The tempest needs a new voice.
Marisha: Thank you for your belief in me. Kaitiaki, Patisse.
Matt: Kaitiaki, young Keyleth.
Sam: You're welcome.
Laura: Kai... tiaki.
Marisha: (quietly) Good job.
Taliesin: Kaitiaki. (all laugh)
Sam: Kaiahoga.
Marisha: What did you say?
Laura: Kamehameha.
Liam: Ticonderoga... pencils.
Sam: I pull Vax aside and say--
Liam: What's up, buddy?
Sam: Poise, grace, confidence, she is amazing.
Liam: Yeah? That's true.
Sam: Is she your leader?
Liam: Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes.
Sam: (quietly) Incredible.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: I'm learning so much already, thank you again.
Liam: That's-- you're welcome, that's good. That's good. One step at a time.
Sam: Absolutely.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Vax, you made sure Tary partook of some of the soil here, right? It's an Ashari tradition, right?
Liam: What? Are you asking me if he shit here? What are you talking about?
Travis: No, no. He has to eat-- did you? Tary, did you manage to get some of the soil in your mouth?
Sam: The what in my mouth?
Travis: It's a custom here you have to eat the dirt of the earth Ashari.
Liam: I walk off. I'm not getting part of this.
Sam: Absolutely. I will do it.
Travis: You don't want to be offensive.
Sam: You're absolutely right.
Travis: Yeah. Custom is important.
Sam: Mm-hm. Following the local customs, I took a handful of dirt and shoved it down my fucking throat. (all laugh)
Matt: (coughs) You go into an immediate coughing fit as the--
Sam: (coughs)
Matt: -- the surface dirt here is built from constant colliding of stone and rock, and a lot of it has been ground to almost a fine powder in places--
Liam: Have some volcanic ash.
Matt: -- yeah, yeah. It's akin to the cinnamon challenge in a way. (all laugh)
Sam: (coughs)
Travis: Just stay with it, the first time's the worst. Don't dilute it with any water or anything.
Taliesin: Just thinking, it's like diatomaceous earth. Just hateful.
Travis: You're toughening up already.
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: Ooh, your voice sounds deeper.
Sam: Yeah, that is my vocal cords being covered in dirt.
Travis: I like this.
Laura: Why are your vocal cords covered in dirt?
Sam: I just ate dirt.
Laura: Why on earth would you eat dirt?
Sam: I'll go into my satchel and pull out some healing draught, and just-- ah, just take a big gulp.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: It feels much better.
Sam: Much better. Shall we?
Taliesin: Yes, let's.
Liam: Kiki, what do you think? Are we staying here for the night, or-- I mean, we just got here, it's the middle of the day, isn't it?
Laura: Can we Treestride again today?
Marisha: Yeah, we can.
Liam: We need to make camp? You need to rest? Or can we go now?
Marisha: I'm good. After this we'll probably have-- No, I'm good. I mean--
Taliesin: We Treestride, we get a ship, and then--
Marisha: And then I'll be resting.
Taliesin: -- we spend a night on the ship.
Laura: Ooh, I like it.
Travis: I like it.
Taliesin: Isn't that gonna be fun?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: I haven't been on a ship si-- Oh my, yeah.
Marisha: Are we gonna do the airship, or-- no, I guess we left the airship in Whitestone.
Taliesin: Well, we-- technically, we--
Marisha: Or did we leave it in Emon?
Taliesin: We left it in Emon.
Matt: Emon.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Hopefully, it's-- you know, let's see if it's still intact.
Travis: What's wrong with a boat? We haven't been on a boat.
Marisha: That's true.
Taliesin: I'm kind of feeling the boat.
Travis: Yeah, me too.
Marisha: You guys wanna go on a boat?
Liam: You are feeling the boat over the airship?
Taliesin: I haven't been on a boat in a long time, and I'm feeling a little weird about an airship.
Travis: Thank you.
Liam: I know, but you practically sang ballads for airships for weeks.
Taliesin: I know.
Laura: Yeah, and we got one.
Taliesin: We did-- we could--
Travis: He tap-dances on boats.
Taliesin: I mean, I wouldn't object to it, I just--
Liam: So one and done, all right.
Marisha: Wait, does this mean--
Laura: We can be regular pirates now.
Marisha: Does this mean we can get yacht gear if we go on a boat-- or pirate gear?
Liam: I'm on a boat!
Taliesin: I'm not getting the proper shoes.
Laura: (gasps) Pirate gear!
Marisha: Pirate gear!
Sam: Boat shoes? I own boat shoes.
Taliesin: I knew you would.
Liam: What does that mean?
Travis: You do?
Sam: They're great, they're flat-soled, they are white, and--
Liam: White.
Taliesin: They are.
Sam: Yes, they are--
Marisha: You mean like Keds? You're talking about Keds?
Taliesin: No, no, they're boating shoes.
Sam: Boat shoes.
Marisha: Boat shoes. (laughs)
Taliesin: They're actually boating shoes. I am embarrassed that I know exactly what you're talking about.
Sam: Of course.
Liam: Your boating shoes, I'm sure, are very white.
Sam: Yes, they are.
Travis: What are they made of, leather?
Sam: With little leather stripes--
Travis: Yeah, they're made of leather.
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: And a little sailor's cap.
Laura: No.
Liam: Ooh, no.
Taliesin: I'm so excited.
Sam: I have a navigator's kit.
Matt: He does, it's-- (all laugh)
Matt: He does.
Sam: Let's set sail!
Matt: Yeah!
Sam: A sextant and everything.
Taliesin: That is-- that is my favorite phrase in the English language, is "I have a kit for that."
Marisha: I have a kit for that. (laughs)
Taliesin: You have just come upon it.
Matt: I'm so excited that worked out.
Liam: What is going on?
Matt: All right. So--
Marisha: Well, that's fun.
Matt: You find your way back to the edge of the valley, to the same tree that you made your Transport via Plants through--
Marisha: I do the touristy thing to 'em again on the way out, like I do.
Matt: Pointing out. What is your destination tree?
Marisha: (stammers)
Taliesin: Pine.
Marisha: Our keep. Greyskull Keep. Garden. Tree.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry. That just took a while to find in my brain.
Laura: I imagine you saying all that as you touch the tree.
Marisha: (stammers) It's been a long few weeks.
Travis: The channel just--
Marisha: Only the best, only the best.
Matt: You transport from the outskirts of Terra, find your way back to Greyskull Keep, and walking towards Emon proper. You can see now, even from the distance as you approach, the walls, some of the larger buildings, the higher towers and structures that just barely peek over the wall, you can see are already in the process of repair. You can see--
Laura: Wow, that was fast.
Matt: -- teams of people that are in-- currently trying to rebuild and restructure as you enter from the southern gates of the city and enter the streets, it's more lively than you've ever seen it. People are returning. People are coming back and reclaiming what remains of their homesteads, many of them still intact without a problem. The damage was extensive, but not universal in the city, and so I'd say there's still a good 60% to 70% of the city that is mostly without damage, and there are areas that are just destroyed, but even those, people are picking up, reclaiming-- There appears to be a process of memorial being constructed on the outskirts of the Cloudtop to remember those who fell in the battle for Emon. There is also the skyport, which was on the outskirts of the Cloudtop, and up there you can see the skyship Deera, however it looks to have sustained a severe amount of damage--
Liam: Damn it!
Matt: -- in the battle, and is in the process of also receiving its own repairs.
Liam: Son of a bitch.
Laura: Oh, I hope Captain Damon's all right.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Oh, jesus.
Laura: He's so dreamy.
Travis: Heartthrob Damon.
Taliesin: He's just gotten a little scar.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: The perfect scar.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Now he's dangerous Damon.
Marisha: Cap Damon.
Laura: He's got the-- no, he's got the Harrison Ford.
Taliesin: Is this the Harrison Ford, or is it the scar right below the cheek so that when he cries it hits the scar and goes down.
Marisha: Oh yeah, and it trickles down.
Liam: I mean either way, he can make it work, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah. All right, so what are you guys doing?
Taliesin: It's like a little pachinko machine of pain.
Travis: Run the canal, run the canal.
Liam: Don't leave me hanging up top. Woo!
Laura: That was a good one.
Marisha: Pike's here, right? She's in the city.
Matt: Pike is in the city somewhere, you haven't found her, you don't know where she is.
Marisha: 'Cause I imagine she would have good recommendations on good crews--
Liam: Boats.
Marisha: -- and boats.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Marisha: So, let's try and find Pike.
Travis: Didn't she just say a good crew? She just said to find a good crew.
Laura: Find a good crew.
Taliesin: She wouldn't maybe not know, necessarily.
Marisha: Would Pike know if there's a good crew? Let's save ten minutes on finding Pike. Would Pike know if there's a good crew?
Matt: Pike had one crew that she travelled with on the ocean--
Liam: Seems dodgy.
Sam: They're all dead.
Taliesin: They're not dead, they just left her.
Matt: But that crew, I will say for the sake of time, is not currently docked at Emon.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: She was busy doing push-ups on that cruise.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: One-handed.
Laura: Let's go to the docks, you guys. Today.
Marisha: To the docks!
Matt: You find yourself at the western docks of Emon.
Liam: Ter the dercks!
Marisha: Ter the dercks!
Taliesin: Ter the dercks.
Matt: You hear the familiar sound of seagulls and other water-based fowl, mixed with the creaking of wood from large ships that are all making their way in and out of this rather large port here on the side of the Ozmit Sea. You can see there's a lot of goods coming into the city now, as a lot of heavy orders have come from nearby villages to transport goods as part of the recovery, both from the south from the Mornset as well as things that were too large to carry by cart from Syngorn, and have been coming up along the coast, avoiding Dagger Bay, and making their way up to Emon. There are a number of individuals around, and who would want to spearhead the investigation--
Marisha: I'm not good at investigating. Who's good at investigating?
Laura: I'll go.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Roll an investigation check.
Liam: I'll back you up. Me too, me too.
Taliesin: Looks good.
Laura: 19?
Liam: 18. Oh, you've done me in by one.
Laura: Oh, by one!
Liam: One.
Matt: Asking about for a while, you eventually-- people point you in the direction of what appears to be an individual named Dockmaster Abban.
Marisha: Dockmaster Oban?
Liam: Abban.
Matt: Abban. A-B-B-A-N.
Marisha: Abban.
Taliesin: Abban.
Marisha: A-B-B-A-N.
Matt: You're eventually led to this individual who, pointed out, is dressed simply at first glance. The clothing he wears, just a plain white, billowing shirt, nice tailored pants, and some boots that go just up to the mid-calf. Dark brown-red skin, completely shaved, smooth, bald, shining in the sun, no facial hair, with piercing blue-grey eyes. As soon as you begin to approach, he's finishing a conversation with someone and turns to you and flashes the brightest of white smiles and goes, "Hello! Ah, you look like you are looking for some help, or in aid of something, yes? No?"
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You're staring at me. What do you want?
Laura: We are-- I don't know if you've noticed, but the city has just been saved.
Matt: I have noticed it, strangely enough. I've watched it be saved, and--
Laura: Yes, then you maybe saw us in the fray, and now, after saving this beautiful city, we are on our way to the middle of the fucking sea. Would somebody be able to take us?
Matt: Well, are you looking for a-- to purchase a vessel?
Laura: No. To rent a crew of well-seasoned sailors who know their way around the ocean.
Matt: I guess it really depends on the size of the vessel you're taking-- what ship do you have?
Taliesin: We're looking to-- I'm cutting in for a second--
Laura: Sure, darling.
Liam: Sure.
Taliesin: -- charter, dear, charter. You're looking to charter.
Laura: We're looking to charter a ship.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I just learn so much from you, you know?
Taliesin: I-- well, this was just--
Travis: Barf.
Laura: Take over.
Matt: And where are you travelling?
Taliesin: No, please.
Liam: Ah, that's complicated.
Laura: Well, just very close to Hespit, actually, not far so-- very far southwest--
Matt: How close to the Hespits?
Liam: We're hoping for a bit of a discount for the group that is responsible for this city still existing.
Taliesin: She's much better at this than you.
Marisha: Oh, man.
Liam: Give it a second, please.
Taliesin: Okay.
Liam: Doubting Thomas.
Matt: I have-- I apologise, I do not follow this train of thought. Discount?
Liam: (sighs) Do your fucking thing, whatever. (all laugh)
Liam: I didn't roll any kind of a check, I just got shat upon, but whatever, do your thing. And I walk off.
Travis: I just got shat upon.
Taliesin: I just-- I don't feel the dice were necessary at that point.
Travis: (laughs) Shat upon.
Liam: I do! I do! They're necessary all the time. All the time! Except when it comes--
Travis: Do I?
Liam: --to me. Go, go, do your thing. Do your thing. I'm gone.
Matt: No, you-- Okay. Vax walks away before he finishes his point, and doesn't get to make his roll.
Liam: Yep.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, whatever, Matthew, whatever.
Matt: What?
Liam: What roll?
Matt: All right.
Sam: We'll never know.
Laura: Forgive my brother, he gets very embarrassed when he talks about how much we've saved. Humble creature.
Matt: I'm still very confused here. You're asking for a discount, why? Because the city was saved?
Laura: Oh, well I wasn't, of course not.
Matt: Look, I don't know who you are, I don't know what you're trying to do here--
Travis: We killed all the dragons.
Matt: --but we're in the process of trying to recover the economy of what was once a very strong economy, of a town that has been under attack. Now, we cannot offer discounts to anybody because right now, we're all in financial dire straits.
Laura: Understandable.
Matt: So, if you're going to ship, if you're going to move, if you're going to charter, if you're going to purchase, it's going to have to be the ask--
Laura: We're looking to charter a ship, full of sailors, who can get us to a circular reef to the southwest, near the Hespit.
Matt: Captain Adella. That would be your best bet.
Laura: Captain Adella.
Matt: "Now." And he points off to the end of one of the nearest docks, there's two that are close by, and there's a long row of various ships that are in the process of being loaded and unloaded, but there appears to be one sailing ship. They have some galleys and long-ships along the side, but there's a sailing ship with the sails currently tied up and bound to the mast, and a crew that is lounging on the deck. There is a woman, towards the edge, that's just walking past. You cannot make out a lot of details from this point, but he points over. "That is Captain Adella. She will be able to help you."
Laura: Thank you so much, Dockmaster.
Matt: Of course. Now, if you wish to charter, speak with her. Let her know that the Dockmaster is the one that brought you that point, and all shall be well.
Laura: Wonderful.
Matt: "All right. Good luck, travel safe." And he turns around and walks aw--
Laura: Percy, do we tip him? I don't know how this works.
Taliesin: No, I think we just--
Sam: No, we do not tip him.
Laura: Oh, all right.
Travis: Can I just ask before we leave, how much are the ships that are for sale?
Matt: Oh! Well, it depends on the ship that you are looking for. For a long-ship, no crew of course, which is a fairly decent speed, requires maybe 30 to 40 rowers, and a handful of deck hands, that would run you about 10,000 gold pieces?
Laura: Oh, that's it?
Taliesin: That's a long-ship--
Travis: Just let me ask the important questions, you all retire.
Laura: We don't even need that.
Taliesin: We need a big-- we need a bigger ship.
Travis: If I wanted a ship that had, let's say, this many sails, and came with a crew, how much would that be, about?
Matt: Are you talking about a fully outfitted galleon?
Travis: That.
Taliesin: Yes, yes you are.
Matt: I would put that... well, I mean the crew you'd have to pay whatever they're asking, but for the actual ship, the general asking price can range somewhere in around 30,000 to 40,000 gold pieces.
Travis: 30,000 to 40,000 pieces, that's what I thought. Yep. Thank you.
Matt: Right. Obviously a man of the world.
Taliesin: Do you want a galleon, Grog?
Travis: These dock pretzels are amazing.
Sam: He's literally picking up dried pieces of seagull poop. (all laugh)
Taliesin: There is this thing for seasickness, with seaweed--
Laura: Dock pretzels.
Travis: It's not pretty.
Marisha: Grog, that's-- that's not like free peanuts at the tavern.
Taliesin: That's not-- that's...
Laura: That was so gross.
Travis: Really crunchy.
Marisha: The profile of that.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: There's protein in everything. Everything.
Travis: Well, let's go get a ship.
Laura: Oh my god. Wow. We could seriously buy a ship.
Taliesin: We could, or we could just--
Laura: I mean we have no need for a ship.
Taliesin: What are we going to do when we're done with it?
Laura: I know, right?
Taliesin: I know, really.
Laura: We've gotta be frugal, even though we don't have to be, we should be.
Taliesin: It's not even frugal, this is just what you do once you have money--
Laura: Exactly.
Taliesin: -- you only buy things you need, and just lease everything else. It's very, very common. It's all good.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: This is very true.
Matt: All righty. As you guys walk to the edge of the--
Taliesin: Leasing.
Liam: It's true.
Matt: --aforementioned dock that was pointed out, you come to the outskirts of this larger sailing ship, and as you begin to walk up, and your footfalls 'clack-clack, clack-clack, clack' against the dock, a couple of the deckhands that are kind of leaning off to the side, kind of just looking up, one of them appears to be taking a hit off of a flask of some kind, both hear the footfalls and get up and turn around, spin and look. "Cap'n? Cap'n!" And they kind of point over and the coat-wearing figure that you saw walking across the deck of the ship spins around, and begins to abruptly quicken her pace in the direction of the gangplank that leads off onto the side of the dock. As she comes up to the edge, reaching and grabbing the sides of it, you see before you a woman with long, sea-air tattered mass of hair. It is just this halo of crimped, curled, and wild dark hair that's also been sun-bleached to the point where the tips kinda go light. It is crazed in appearance immediately as she arrives. She looks spry and somewhat young, maybe late 20s early 30s, but her skin has been very heavily weathered from all these days at sea, and you can see already she's getting these crows nests at the corners of her face, but has a very bright smile, and her light brown coat hangs just past her calf-high boots. She looks like the kind of woman who captains a ship. As she glances over, "Hi. You looking for a crew?"
Marisha: You look like a pirate!
Matt: I do not look like a pirate. Why would you say that?
Taliesin: She meant it as a compliment.
Marisha: Where do you buy your clothes?
Matt: Are you looking for a crew or not?
Laura: Why, yes we are! I assume you're Captain Adella.
Matt: Yes. (laughs) I see my reputation precedes me.
Taliesin: By about ten feet.
Laura: Yes, it does. Dockmaster Abban speaks very highly of you. Do you know your way around the Ozmit?
Matt: Quite a bit actually, I do. Where you looking to go?
Laura: Near the Hespit Sea? Near the Hespit? I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Marisha: Yep, that's right. Southwest.
Liam: Hespit-bound.
Laura: Ish.
Matt: No. We don't travel to the Hespit. That's--
Laura: It's near the Hespit, not quite--
Marisha: Have you stumbled upon Vesrah?
Matt: Vesrah, I know of.
Laura: Oh! Perfect.
Matt: I know of it.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Goodness gracious.
Taliesin: We would be excited to make it worth your while.
Matt: How worth your while?
Laura: How worth our while are you thinking?
Taliesin: What is your while worth, I imagine?
Matt: Well, we have a crew here, 12 deckhands, my captaining and navigating skills, a first mate, and the use of the ship... that would run you-- let's put it at 150 gold per day for chartering the ship.
Taliesin: There's six of us and a bear.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: The bear sleeps in jewelry.
Sam: And a robot.
Taliesin: Oh, and a robot. An automaton. Can I say automaton?
Sam: He doesn't eat, it'll be fine.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Well this has certainly got real interesting, didn't it? All right! So, have we a deal?
Taliesin: 150 gold a day?
Liam: That's nothing for us.
Laura: How many crew-- 12-man crew?
Liam: Vex'ahlia. We have so--
Laura: No, I think that's a fair price.
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: She is such not a good negotiator. What is going on?
Liam: Hey, buddy?
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Liam: There's a lot of--
Sam: I will be quiet.
Liam: -- inner working dynamics in this group that you don't know anything about--
Sam: I'll be-- you're right.
Liam: If you'd just wait a bit, all right?
Sam: You're right, I will be quiet.
Liam: That sounds good.
Taliesin: I'm so pleased.
Matt: "Fine. You've found yourself a leader, a captain, and a partner." Shakes your hand. "So."
Travis: Are you all right?
Laura: Honestly, I feel...
Matt: Vesrah, you say? Crazy water folk. Who am I to judge? But yes, six to seven days travel at sea, depending on the weather, of course. Storms are common this time of year, do keep in mind we will be passing north of the Hespit, so be wary of any wandering bandit ships.
Laura: Bandit ships?
Marisha: Not pirates.
Matt: Or pirates, you can call them pirates as well, but we already had that conversation.
Marisha: And you are definitely not--
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: --a pirate.
Matt: Not anymore.
Marisha: Nope. You just look really cool.
Travis: What kinda weapons you got on this ship?
Matt: Oh! We've got some ballistae. We travel with speed.
Travis: Oh. It's a fast ship?
Liam: What d'you mean?
Matt: Fast ship.
Liam: You got-- you got nothing?
Marisha: Oh, we don't need weapons. We're weapons!
Laura: We're weapons.
Taliesin: We're quite fierce.
Marisha: We're the most deadly thing in this land.
Laura: How often do sea monsters sprout up on you? Ever? I've never been on the sea.
Matt: Often enough.
Marisha: Often enough?
Laura: Really?
Liam: We have, we were just way high above it.
Laura: Well yeah, not like in it.
Travis: Oh that's true, we have never been in a boat, yeah.
Taliesin: Actually, that's a good question. How many of us have actually been on a ship before?
Liam: I'm afraid of getting nauseous, actually.
Taliesin: Am I really-- come on.
Sam: I had a boat--
Laura: You own boat shoes.
Sam: I had a boat in one of my larger baths that I would take at night, and it would go on epic adventures through the bubbles! But never quite at sea.
Travis: What was the boat's name?
Sam: The boat was the SS... ... that's it. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Even better than I could have possibly imagined.
Matt: That's adorable. Well, welcome to my ship. She is called the Drensala Vis--
Sam: That's such a cool name.
Liam: Drensala Vis.
Marisha: Drensala Vis.
Liam: Drensala Vis!
Taliesin: The Drensala Vis.
Matt: It is Marquesian for Luck of the Mother.
Taliesin: Mother Lucker.
Liam: Mother Lucker.
Matt: Treat her well and she'll treat you well in kind. Respect my crew, respect my authority, respect our direction, and we'll do just fine. So! To the crazy water people. Welcome on board the Drensala Vis.
Taliesin: Aye, Captain.
Laura: Do we need anything? Do we need anything before we do--
Marisha: Did she just say crazy water people?
Liam: Too many mother luckers!
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: I don't think we need anything. Do we need anything?
Taliesin: I think as long as the ship is prepared and has--
Travis: Anything you can buy on dry land?
Taliesin: --everything stocked, everything it needs, I think we're just reasonable.
Travis: I've got a couple canisters of underwater breathing that nobody else has.
Taliesin: And I have the remnants of several bottles of liquor. I'm quite pleased.
Marisha: I will come stacked with some water-breathing stuff. I think we can do it to eight people for like an hour or something like that?
Travis: There you go.
Liam: That'll help in the middle of the ocean.
Marisha: That'll definitely help.
Laura: Do you think that Raven's Slumber is waterproof?
Matt: You imagine the enchantment probably is waterproof.
Laura: All right. I would hate to-- little baby, mini Trinket in there gets like drowned or something if I'm underwater.
Liam: Yeah. You don't wanna drop the iPhone in the toilet.
Laura: Exactly. Or the bathtub.
Travis: About what time of day is it right now?
Liam: What do you mean?
Matt: Right now, it's a little bit past three o'clock in the afternoon.
Travis: Shouldn't we go out early in the morning?
Taliesin: Why?
Travis: Isn't that what you do? You, like, set sail--
Sam: You can sail all night while we sleep on the ship.
Laura: I wanna sleep on the ship!
Marisha: It's gonna be like a seven-hour trip-- or a seven-day trip.
Taliesin: You're gonna get to sleep on a hammock, Grog.
Liam: You can spend days on a ship.
Taliesin: There'll be a hammock.
Travis: What if it's only a three-hour tour?
Liam: Tary, there wo-- what is that in reference to?
Taliesin: No. I'm not even dignifying that with a groan--
Travis: Come on, Tal, you're with me.
Taliesin: That would not even-- I expect better of you.
Liam: It would make for a good beginning of a chapter to set out at dawn.
Sam: That is true. Poetically it would be nice, but--
Taliesin: He could just write that we set out at dawn.
Sam: I am eager to get my adventuring on, L.E.B., so I am eager to go.
Travis: All right, yeah.
Taliesin: Little elf girl. L.E.B. Little elf boy.
Travis: I'm fine with that.
Marisha: Adella.
Matt: Yes?
Liam: Little elf boy?
Marisha: Oh, been on the sea a little long. Is your crew ready to go? Or would it be better to set sail in the morning?
Matt: Well. We leave at your leisure, but we're not against the idea of a raucous final evening at the local tavern.
Laura: How many beds do you have on that ship?
Sam: You're asking us to get her drunk?
Liam: Well...
Sam: Is that true?
Liam: I mean--
Sam: Is that what's happening?
Liam: We've really been through the shit, so I'm not opposed. Just saying.
Matt: Not including for my crew? we have bunks for at least 15 other passengers.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Bunks? Or rooms? I mean, obviously you don't have rooms for--
Matt: Between the bunks, six rooms.
Liam: How many bunks per room?
Matt: Two or three, depending.
Laura: Oh.
Liam: That's weird.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: No, no. It's quite common.
Laura: No, it's totally doable.
Liam: No, it's weird.
Taliesin: No, it's quite common.
Liam: I disagree.
Taliesin: I think it's perfectly fine.
Liam: Well, you're fucked.
Laura: Let's just go.
Matt: If you don't find--
Liam: Yeah. Fuck it.
Matt: "Good! Grab your things! On this ship! Let's set sail!" Starts giving out orders to her crew, seems to now kind of come to life, and they're starting to go ahead and start pulling up anchor, they're starting to get the sails ready. You already can feel the spray of the water as the tide's coming in now, the water's starting to get a little choppier as it's hitting up against the side of the docks and the shore end.
Sam: A sea voyage. This is unprecedented.
Liam: Oh, jeez.
Sam: Doty, take down every word of anyone saying anything ever on this whole trip. This is amazing. I'm so excited.
Matt: Doty stops for a second, leans back, and then starts scribbling furiously at anything that he can pick up within earshot.
Liam: Tary, staring off into the distance, shat his pants. Crying, into his poo--
Sam: Well, okay, all right, so zing, you got me.
Travis: He pulls out of his waistband-- (all laugh)
Travis: -- and notices the tiny member between his legs.
Sam: You're smarter than I thought, you.
Liam: No, I'm as smart as you thought I was.
Matt: Eventually, the ship disembarks, and begins making its way further out into the water, just as the sun begins to set into the slightly orange, purple, and dark blues of the end of daylight. You can see the various lights in Emon come on, especially towards the dock, as the night comes to life. And out the opposite side, the sparse clouds that are scattered in the distance, the ship picks up the winds and pushes with guiding speed out to the southwest, into the depths of the Ozmit Sea. And that's where we'll pick up next session!
Taliesin: And so--
Marisha: Moana!
Taliesin: As our ship sinks slowly in the west, we bid farewell!
Marisha: It just slowly sinks.
Matt: I finally get to use the ocean voyage audio! (all cheer)
Matt: Had that on my playlist for a long-ass time.
Marisha: Ocean voyage!
Matt: Awesome.
Marisha: We're going on a cruise, you guys!
Matt: That took some interesting turns tonight!
Marisha: Now we learn how shitty cruises are.
Taliesin: I love ships. Ships are great.
Liam: Everybody's vomiting.
Matt: Pretty much.
Taliesin: I think I'm the only character who's spent some time on a boat, at this point.
Marisha: Well, and Pike.
Taliesin: Who's been on a ship. And Pike--
Marisha: Well, Pike's not here--
Liam: I'm on a boat!
Matt: Yeah, Pike's still back at home. Ashley, come back to us!
Laura: I know!
Matt: Blindspot, stop filming! You finished your season, right?
Liam: Almost, almost.
Laura: Almost. So close!
Liam: Getting there.
Matt: We'll get her back. Guys, thank you so much.
Liam: What an episode.
Matt: Ridiculous fucking people.
Marisha: That was so good.
Matt: We're gonna pick up next week, as you head deeper into the Ozmit Sea towards Vesrah. Thank you again Loot Crate for being our awesome sponsors this evening--
All: Lootcrate!
Matt: -- you've been fantastic. The rest of you guys, rest well, sleep well, and is it Thursday yet?
Laura: I'll most likely kill you in the morning.
Matt: Have a good night. [ART]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: (no audio)
Sam: -- is today's sponsor. A leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over 30 years. That's almost as old as I am. Do you like magic? Pirates? Knives? Royals and adventure? Then check out Shades of Magic, the series from Tor Books. The conclusion of which, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so check out the full three-book series. Go to, there's a promo link somewhere on this page-- I'm gonna say right there. Let's say right there.
Travis: Yeah, sure!
Sam: So check that out. And the thing about sponsors, guys, is we really need to show them our love. And really show them that we appreciate what they do for us every week. They're a big part of the show, without them we would-- For instance, without sponsors, Taliesin would only be able to dye his hair platinum blond or brown.
Taliesin: Oh, no.
Marisha: It's true.
Taliesin: It's called Malibu Sunset.
Sam: Yeah. Laura's dice budget would go way down. Instead of throwing away 250 dice a week, it would maybe be more like 240, 230.
Laura: Oh God. Terrible.
Sam: I mean, Liam might have to go back to shaving his beard and selling the beard shavings to those in need.
Matt: To be fair, it was worth it. Look at them on my shelf.
Sam: I have just a few ideas for ways that you guys could show your love for our sponsors. Take them out for a candlelit dinner. I'm not talking Bennigan's, I'm talking something high-end. Shake Shack, Outback, maybe even P.F. Chang's. How about sending some romantic texts to spice things up? Keep it classy, like: Hey, Critical Role Sponsor, I wish you could be with me right now. Or, I had a dream last night, and Critical Role Sponsor? You were in it. And hey, compliments always help. Critical Role Sponsor, do you have a map? 'Cause I'm getting lost in your eyes. Or: Hey, Critical Role Sponsor, of all the beautiful curves on your body, I'm most in love with your smile. Or even: Critical Role Sponsor, on a scale of one to ten, you're a nine, and I'm the one you need.
Marisha: Don't use that one, either, in real life.
Taliesin: That would work on me.
Sam: Or you could just go to their website and buy their products. (all cheer)
Sam: So, Tor Books, thanks so much.
Matt: Thank you, Tor Books, and thank you to all those mentioned restaurants that will never be a sponsor for us now, and it's probably for the best.
Travis: The Bennigan's and the Monte Cristo.
Laura: Oh man, I hit up Bennigan's a lot.
Matt: I know, I was holding out for the P.F. Chang's but, y'know. Thank you so much, Sam, and thank you, Tor Books, for being our awesome sponsor tonight. Make sure to check out A Conjuring of Light, now available to you. All right, next up, the new episode of GM Tips is out. It came out today and this one is about suggestions on homebrewing content for your systems in game. I have, I think, three more episodes that are going on in the coming weeks, so look forward to those.
Marisha: And then we hand it off to someone awesome.
Matt: Exactly. We have a new person stepping in, after those episodes, showing their own flavor to the series. I'm excited about that.
Marisha: Because you can only learn so much from one teacher.
Matt: Exactly.
Marisha: The best teachers will teach you that.
Matt: Yep.
Travis: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles only had Master Splinter.
Marisha: Shut. Up.
Travis: Daniel-san only had Mr. Miyagi.
Marisha: This is the real world, okay? This isn't fantasy.
Sam: They were homeschooled, okay?
Matt: And how many times did they have to reboot that to make it work?
Travis: That's a good point.
Matt: Eventually ending with the Michael Bay films. So check out that episode of GM Tips. As a reminder to all you guys looking to homebrew: It's hard. It's time consuming. It's not for everybody.
Laura: But it's so rewarding, Matthew.
Matt: It can be rewarding.
Liam: Could you do it different though?
Matt: Ugh. So check out the episode knowing that, and we'll have next week's episode next Wednesday.
Taliesin: Your other friends tell me that they miss you too. So yeah.
Marisha: Mm-hm. That's true.
Matt: Yeah, I know. I'll see people again soon. Also, I wanted to give a shout-out. We're in the final 24-hour stretch for the Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire crowdsourced campaign. So if you haven't yet, or you have interest in seeing the sequel to that, go and check it out. They're doing a final 24-hour stream over on Obsidian's stream channel, of course after our episode tonight. Go give them some love. And last, I have my list here, I was just able to announce that I voice Deadshot in the upcoming Justice 2. (all cheer)
Matt: Coming out in mid-May.
Laura: I play Supergirl!
Matt: Yeah! Fantástico! So look forward to that. There may be some more surprises as the cast is announced progressively down the road. Super happy to be a part of it.
Laura: Super happy.
Taliesin: (groan)
Marisha: (groan)
Matt: I need more alcohol. (all laugh)
Travis: Immediately.
Matt: Immediately. Taliesin, you wanted to mention something about your new show?
Taliesin: Yeah, we had the very first episode of The Wednesday Club this week.
Travis: Yeah!
Taliesin: I have now had eight hours of sleep, which is pretty magical.
Marisha: It was so good.
Taliesin: It was fun. And we're gonna be back this week with our next episode. We're actually gonna be talking about a lot of things, including characters with mental health issues in comic books, both superhero and otherwise. Including Legion, from the X-Men, who has currently got a show on FX which is magical.
Travis: Yeah he does. It's really good.
Matt: It's really, really good. Holy shit.
Taliesin: It's so good. So tune in, it's noon 'til two on Wednesdays, on the twitch stream where you probably are right now.
Matt: Noon 'til two Pacific.
Taliesin: And I think we bumped it to Alpha, but I don't remember, maybe not. And then it'll be on the rebroadcast if you wanna see it, but it's gonna be a lot of fun. Matt Key and Amy Dallen will be there, it's gonna be great.
Matt: Cool. Thank you, Taliesin. If nobody else has anything else to say...
Travis: Cheese is for everybody. Not just me.
Sam: Did you just say Jesus for everybody?
Travis: Cheese.
Marisha: Cheez Its?
Liam: Jesus for everybody.
Matt: Cheezits Christ for everybody.
Travis: Cheez Its Crust. (all laugh)
Matt: Without further ado, let's bring us into tonight's episode of Critical Role. (opening credits)
Matt: Hello, and welcome back. So, picking up where we last left off. Vox Machina, having defeated the Chroma Conclave, and restoring order and, for the time being, peace to the landscape of Tal'Dorei, resurrected your friend, Scanlan Shorthalt. However, he realised he needed some time to himself, to both connect with his interest in direction and life, and with his estranged illegitimate daughter, Kaylie. Upon leaving, the party proceeded to find their way to close all the loose ends that they hadn't quite had time to get to with the Conclave's assault. That involved returning the ashes of Senokir's wife to Vasselheim, and then making your way to Ank'Harel to deliver the hands of Ripley to the Scarbearers guild. On your way there you encountered a new adventurer, Taryon Darrington, who was looking to join an adventuring group for experience--
Liam: He's my favorite.
Matt: Yes, he's the best. He paid his way into your service and upon being returned to Whitestone you gave him a hazing, which broke him enough to be a little more honest with his reasoning for going on this adventure.
Laura: Let's not call it a hazing. It was an audition.
Matt: It was an audition, it was a brutal audition.
Marisha: (singing) Don't call it a comeback!
Matt: There you go. In which, knowing more about your new companion, you accepted him for the time being, understanding the dangers that are involved in following your path and he accepted. You made your way to Emon, looking as a way to find passage towards Vesrah, the home of the Water Ashari and the hopeful completion of Keyleth's AraMente. Upon finding and hiring a crew under the Captain Adella, you made your way onto your new ship and began to traverse westward onto the Ozmit Sea.
Travis: Shit, we're on a boat. We're on a boat motherfuckers!
Marisha: (singing) Don't you ever forget! (all laugh)
Matt: There is that.
Liam: We are noble creatures.
Matt: So.
Travis: (gasps) I hear the ocean.
Sam: That's someone snoring. (all laugh)
Taliesin: It's a rainstick.
Matt: So you guys have been at sea for a handful of days. It's been relatively uneventful. The boat slowly rocks, as the waters of the Ozmit are much calmer by comparison to that of the Lucidian Ocean. Making them a much more popular trade route pass between the various continents on this side of Exandria. Now the slow rocking of the boat, across the somewhat choppy waters, leads some of you into a relaxing lull over these days. Others, into perpetual bouts of nausea. But you notice that Captain Adella runs a relatively tight ship. Her crew works like clockwork, at her order, and the skies are thankfully clear these first few days, and the journey so far is mild. What would you guys like to-- Is there anything you wish to accomplish as you are travelling across the sea?
Taliesin: I've got a little bit of sketching, and working on something simple, that I might even try and build while I'm here.
Marisha: I'll catch up on some reading, I guess. Some of my alchemy reading.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Stephen King novel.
Marisha: From I've been doing, trying to make that better.
Matt: Fair enough. Anyone else?
Liam: I have been sort of shadowing Grog for a couple of days, 'cause he doesn't have any gnomes to hang out with.
Travis: Oh that's right. Oh, fuck, it's real when you said it!
Liam: I have been playing Boulder, Parchment, Shears, and telling him stories.
Travis: The non-violent kind.
Liam: Yes, yes. Just hanging out, off and on.
Matt: Okay. Vex?
Laura: I guess I've been trying to get to know Tary a little bit better. And also flying like Vex-Kite behind the ship.
Matt: Okay. And Taryon?
Sam: Lots of push-ups, trying to beef up my pecs. I also, at the start of every day, I'm going to take two of those-- I have a bunch of silver coins that I carry around with me, and I'm gonna cast a couple of spells into them, just to have them at the ready. I cast Fly into one and Blur into the other.
Matt: Okay, good to know.
Sam: And then I would probably wander down to good old Percy, and just ask him if he needs help with any tinkering.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, no, I wanna see what he has, too. Like, there's gonna be some trading. I'll show stuff.
Matt: I'll show you mine, if you show me yours?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Matt: Perfect. So, as the two tinkering nerds begin to reveal their secret inner interests, Vex, you, about three days into this venture, you catch what looks to be a dark spot right on the horizon. Midday, maybe like two o'clock in the afternoon, it's a warm sun, this far, as you start moving westward and southward, you head closer to what would be the equator of the planet. It's getting warmer, and the sea spray is coming up, the smell of seawater and brine occasionally meets your nose, as the ship hits the various waves as they come across, but you're still keeping a keen eye out. And it's just endless sea in all directions, you see no landmass, but you see a little bit of something appearing at the horizon.
Laura: Like land, potentially?
Matt: It could very well be land.
Laura: I guess I'll fly down and-- I'm gonna try and stay off the deck as much as possible, since it makes me so nauseous.
Matt: So you just glide around the--
Laura: Yes.
Travis: Your imaginary character is also nauseous.
Laura: Potentially, yes.
Travis: That's a bummer.
Laura: I know, right. Vex hasn't had a lot of experience with ships, you know.
Liam: Does your real self also get sea sick?
Laura: I may have fed a couple sharks in my lifetime.
Travis: She painted the ocean. It was amazing.
Marisha: Ooh.
Laura: I'm gonna fly down and tell Captain Adella.
Matt: Okay. Keeping an eye out, and as you move, you catch a little more of the shape in the distance. It looks a little small to be a landmass. If it is landmass, it's a very small one.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: But it's stationary.
Laura: Oh, it could be another ship, possibly.
Matt: It could be a ship, it could be anything that would be stationary. Literally, it's only because of your keen vantage point, and your honed eyesight, that you're able to even make that slight, little bump in the horizon from here.
Laura: All right. Captain?
Matt: As you fly down, you see her, she's at the front of the ship. She has her one hand currently on the wheel, and she's looking out, chatting to the side with one of her crewmates, and turns around as you fly down next to her. She's surprised at your immediate appearance and she's like, "Oh, (gasps) sorry, I--"
Laura: You'll get used to that someday.
Matt: One of these days, I'm sure.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Laura: I see something on the horizon; do you know of any masses in the area? Maybe a ship, or island, or--
Matt: "Take the helm." She hands off the wheel to one of her compatriots, and she rummages over in one of the small chests to the side, and pulls out a large scroll and slams it onto a table she keeps maybe ten feet off to the right of her. And she goes through and pulls out a few instruments. Marks the sun and takes a good five minutes or so getting a really strong idea of where the positioning is. She looks down. "No, not much in the way of landmasses out here, my dear."
Laura: Do you have a telescope?
Matt: She goes and pulls out her particular eye glass. It's small, but functional. Glances over, and you look over in the direction and point it out. There's nothing on the horizon.
Laura: May I take that and fly up? I swear I'll give it back.
Matt: There's a long pause--
Laura: I've got nowhere to hide.
Liam: Careful, butterfingers.
Matt: Passes it over.
Laura: Up.
Matt: You take off, look up, extend it, keeping a close view. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Travis: First one of the day.
Laura: (screams) First one, first one, first one. Which of you?
Travis: Set the tone. Roll like a champion.
Laura: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Liam: Natural one, the spyglass has fallen in the ocean.
Laura: Shut up, don't say it out loud!
Travis: Why did you go with the weenie one?
Laura: Shut up. 21?
Matt: 21? Okay. You take a moment and glance out in the same direction you were, and you scan past the horizon. Nothing.
Laura: Motherfuck. Well, I come back down. It went under water, whatever it was. Does that mean it was big enough to be some sort of sea monster? Was it a sea monster?
Matt: "I sincerely hope not, for all of our sakes. But, nevertheless, I'm gonna go ahead and have the men man our ballistas. Just to be safe."
Laura: How quickly do those things move?
Matt: "What things?"
Laura: Sea monsters.
Matt: "Depends on the sea monster."
Laura: This one was very large.
Matt: "Hopefully slowly." And she shouts off, "Full sail!" A bunch of the deckhands start pulling the ropes down, letting the sail come to a full-- flutter of wind itself isn't too terribly strong, but it's enough to at least inflate the sails even further, and give a little more of a speedy direction.
Laura: I wanna go back up and keep an eye, with the spyglass, on any kind of movement, that looks like it's coming towards us.
Matt: Okay, cool. Some of her men go over and start loading the large ballistas to the back of the ship. Anybody else hanging out on the deck?
Travis: Can I run to the bow of the ship? Heading for a new land.
Laura: Oh wow.
Travis: In New York you can-- No, sorry. (all laugh)
Travis: On the bow of the ship.
Matt: There you stand, at the bow of the ship. You see at the very front there's the point, the-- oh man.
Taliesin: Are you really?
Travis: What?
Marisha: Are-- you're not...
Travis: No, I'm just looking to see what I can see. Like one leg up, Captain Morgan style.
Matt: There you go. As you glance out, with your hand above on your brow, guarding the bright, cloudless sunlight down upon you, it is just endless ocean.
Travis: Is there one of those amazing naked ladies on the front of the ship? Holding out the pole, that comes out from the front?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Come on, Gil. Three. (all laugh)
Matt: It's still hard to see from this vantage point. You'll probably have to climb out there, and climb down in front of the ship to see.
Sam: He's in the back of the ship. (all laugh)
Travis: Do we mean to be going backwards?
Marisha: I go up to the deckhands who are manning the sails. Hi, heard it was full sail, full-- Do you need help with anything? To do-- you need--
Laura: Wow.
Marisha: I can make, like, wind.
Travis: Oh, you can!
Marisha: And we can maybe get there faster.
Matt: The gentleman who is there, currently wrapping a rope around his forearm, as he's pulling it down with his full weight, you can see he's maybe in his late twenties, though still going a little grey in the beard, for such a young age, but his skin is weathered, he's kind of missing a few teeth. He's got a large piece of-- like a bandana of cloth wrapped around the front of his head, and just a leather tunic. He kind of looks back to you. "Um, I've got it, but thank you."
Marisha: Oh, okay. 'Cause I can-- You're doing great. Good work.
Matt: Right, okay.
Taliesin: I'm gonna grab Bad News and run up to the crow's nest and see if I can see anything.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Guess word has gotten around the ship then.
Matt: Yeah. Well, she did shout 'full sail,' I guess maybe you went up to see what was going on. You get up to the crow's nest. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Taliesin: Make some room in here. What is my perception? That's 20.
Matt: 20, okay. You get up there, lean out, getting a view, you can see maybe 45 feet up, Vex is also keeping her eye out via broom. Taking her lead, and the direction she's facing, you glance out in that direction, but it's just open sea.
Taliesin: I'm gonna keep an eye out for a moment, for a little bit.
Liam: Is Tary down below?
Sam: I was, but I came up too. Hi, hello, hi. I have one of those little sticker things you put on the back for motion sickness. (all laugh)
Sam: One of these.
Laura: One of those things you put on your wrist? Yeah.
Sam: Hi, good day, good day, all.
Travis: Bidet.
Sam: Good day, hi, hi. That's it. (all laugh)
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I shout out to Percy, what are you guys looking for? Everyone's so excited! This is so exciting.
Travis: Why are you shouting? We have earrings.
Marisha: I was-- because we're on the high seas, and that's what sailors do.
Travis: Is it?
Marisha: Yeah! See, we're sailors, now!
Travis: We're sailors now.
Taliesin: She doesn't have to know what sailors actually do.
Matt: The shiphand who's manning the sail who's a foot from you right now just reaches up and covers his ear and goes, "Uh. We don't really yell that loud all the time into each other's ear, but thank you."
Travis: Yo-ho-ho! And a... help.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Keyleth, ask the captain if she wants to have extra speed from your wind.
Marisha: Captain.
Taliesin: The captain, yes.
Marisha: I was-- I'm not talking to you, anymore, Percy. Captain.
Matt: As you approach from behind, she's currently holding the wheel, and she doesn't even turn her head to you, goes, "Yes?"
Marisha: Would you like more speed behind those sails?
Matt: "I mean, always, but--"
Marisha: Okay! And then I go back and I start doing Gusts into the sails.
Matt: Okay, Gust is a what-level spell?
Marisha: Well, it's a cantrip, or I could do a level three Gust of Wind.
Matt: Gust would be like a (pfft). It's more of a heavy fart.
Marisha: Sorry, level two Gust of Wind.
Laura: Basically you're blowing really hard.
Matt: A level three Gust of Wind, you said?
Marisha: Level two, level two. Gust of Wind.
Matt: Concentration for up to a minute, so okay. So as you focus-- actually, this is not a spell--
Laura: We're gonna be so fast for a minute.
Matt: Second-level spell, and it cannot be done at a higher level.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: However, it gives you a full minute of a very focused gust of wind of, as it-- the sails billow even further. You can see the ropes tighten, the guy with the rope around his arm goes, "Ow ow ow ow!" Has to unwind it real fast, go in and ratchet it to the side. But the sails pick up, and the ship itself picks up speed. For the next minute you've got a nice burst or so. You watch as the captain looks over the shoulder to you and gives you a nod, an approving nod, wordless, but--
Marisha: Captain.
Sam: I turn to Doty, and I say, take this down. With an efficiency and an effective leadership role model for everyone, the redhead continues to propel us forward, faster and faster, to everyone's surprise and respect, including the captain. As the salt licks my nose, and the sweet smell of adventure is in the air, I know that with her on our side, we will be strong and we will be protected. End of chapter.
Matt: The tension on the ship--
Marisha: Hey, look! I've got rubber booties! (laughs)
Sam: You're amazing.
Marisha: Aren't I cool, Tary?
Sam: Yes you are, ahoy!
Marisha: Ahoy!
Sam: (hearty laugh) Delightful!
Matt: The tension on the ship slowly recedes over the next hour as there is no sign of anything else.
Laura: Nothing?
Liam: Hey, man!
Travis: What?
Liam: You can't walk off in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek again. I've been in a barrel for an hour! I fell asleep in there!
Travis: I'm sorry, I get so distracted. Did someone find you?
Liam: No, I just woke up in a barrel, I don't even know what time it is--
Travis: Found you.
Liam: Touché, Grog.
Travis: Hey, do you want to help me? I think there's one of those wooden naked ladies on the front of the ship but I can't really see.
Liam: Uh.
Travis: Wanna reach a hand around and see if you get a handful of wooden boob?
Liam: Do you want me to do a reach-around, is that what you're asking me to do?
Travis: I might not ever ask you again, but right now, yes.
Liam: Okay, yeah, this is not like the wood nymph-- Never mind.
Travis: No, no, no.
Liam: I go ahead and do a reach-around, I suppose.
Matt: Okay. You shimmy out onto the front of the ship. You do actually see just the cusp of what looks like a pair of hands that are clasped, carved into the top of where the wooden point at the front of the ship is. So there is definitely a figure there.
Liam: Yeah, I'll hang down.
Matt: Okay. You hang down, and reach, as one would. (all laugh)
Taliesin: This got weird quick.
Matt: As you kinda grasp over and hold and feel around there--
Laura: This is so ridiculous.
Matt: -- not finding much in the breasts, but you find a bulge. It does indeed have a figure at the front of the ship, this one is not female.
Liam: Is it a wang?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Nice.
Matt: I mean it's a bulge where one would be, yeah.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: This is an equal opportunity ship.
Laura: That's right.
Liam: Pat, pat, pat.
Travis: What you got down there?
Liam: Oh, she's a beaut, Grog, I wish you could see her. (all laugh)
Travis: Really? Describe her to me in vivid detail.
Liam: Oh, uh. Athletic, hearty. You know, curves in all the right places.
Travis: I'm loving this.
Liam: Yup, yup. Your type, I think.
Travis: Man, battle scars?
Liam: Uh.
Travis: How many breasts? Please say three.
Liam: It's one good, one good chest, here. You know what, I will draw you a picture. All right?
Travis: Yeah, that's great!
Liam: Okay. I'm gonna try to climb up without falling into the drink, all right?
Travis: Oh, yeah, that'd be good.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check real fast
Travis: (giggles)
Liam: Is this my character sheet? (all laugh)
Liam: That's a five.
Matt: That's a five? (laughs) You hear this brief bit of tension (sound of exertion). And then a (splash).
Laura: (gasps)
Travis: Vax? Vax? Yeah, okay, right, you fell off the ship. Right? Vax? Um?! (all laugh)
Sam: First player death.
Travis: I think Vax may have fallen overboard.
Marisha: Grog, what did you do?
Travis: I know it could be a very elaborate joke, but you know that sound when you deuce, and it goes  (ker-ploop)? (all laugh)
Travis: I just heard that and I think it was Vax.
Marisha: Ugh.
Laura: Can I look down in the water?
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, you look down, you don't see anybody in the water, but a moment passes and you glance over and there, up the side of the ship, with two daggers, climbing, and soaking, sopping wet with seawater, which has caused all of the heavy, thick black fabric to just become an additional 40 pounds on him, you watch Vax make his way up to the top of the ship once more.
Liam: This is the best this armor has smelled in weeks! (all laugh)
Liam: Ugh. I love the ocean!
Laura: I'm gonna land in the crow's nest with Percy.
Travis: That was amazing! You are so drenched right now.
Liam: I'm twice as heavy as normal.
Travis: Man. Yeah, no seriously, she's that stunning, huh, in the front?
Liam: I start--
Travis: I can't wait for the picture.
Liam: Oh yeah, yes, big.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: Big.
Travis: Big booby. (all laugh)
Liam: That's you.
Travis: Big booby.
Marisha: I kinda do a quick, like, Druidcraft gust and dry him off a little bit.
Matt: Okay. It's like holding a hairdryer to him, just (loud whooshing). (all laugh)
Matt: His lips are like (pbbbft) off to the side briefly.
Liam: I shake like a husky a little bit.
Matt: Exactly.
Matt: All right, you said you head to the crow's nest with Percy?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. Anything in particular, just keeping watch?
Laura: Just keeping watch.
Taliesin: Sitting and sketching.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Looking out every now and then.
Laura: I don't feel as nauseous up here, it's nice.
Taliesin: Quite nice.
Matt: All right. About two hours later, I'll have you both roll perception checks, if you could.
Liam: This is the laziest day we've ever had.
Laura: I know, it's nice.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Taliesin: Wow, no.
Matt: Days at sea, it's nice.
Sam: Meanwhile, Whitestone burns. (all laugh)
Matt: Shh.
Travis: Getting flashes.
Laura: No!
Marisha: No!
Taliesin: To be fair, I'm not really looking very much.
Matt: Fair enough.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: Okay. 11. Yeah, you're distracted.
Travis: Oh, jeez.
Taliesin: I'm distracted.
Matt: With your companion.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. Okay.
Taliesin: You're less distracted.
Laura: Uh, pretty distracted for Vex.
Travis: Is it clear skies or are we sailing through fog?
Matt: Uh, no, it is clear skies.
Travis: Right, so we could just look up, and see horror.
Taliesin: Wait, what?
Travis: What?
Laura: We're not having sex, we're just talking.
Travis: Oh!
Taliesin: Just having a chill. It's just to chill up there. It's nice.
Travis: Oh, right.
Liam: Just like a prom make-out, that's all.
Laura: No! Just chatting.
Taliesin: You're just sitting and drawing in a basket!
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: In a crow's nest? Like a big laundry basket? It's just like--
Taliesin: Yes, it's basically a hamper.
Laura: Yeah. TRAVIS Oh, okay.
Liam: It's the most privacy you've had--
Sam: Any hand action going on?
Taliesin: Oh my God!
Matt: (laughs) Jesus Christ!
Laura: No hand action, no hand action.
Taliesin: That got dark.
Matt: Anyway, you guys, due to distraction, catch it about the same time the rest of the party does. As you look ahead and notice that there is a fog bank forming maybe a few hundred feet ahead of the ship.
Travis: Called it.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Who sees it?
Matt: Well, everybody does now.
Marisha: Oh, everybody does now. Can I do a nature check to see if it looks like natural ocean fog?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: That's not great. 14.
Matt: 14. It doesn't take much for you to realize that this fog is pretty localized. It's not an entire bank that covers the entirety of the ocean in actuance. You kind of travel from one side of the boat to the other to get the scope of it. It's pretty narrow and pretty focused in its direction.
Marisha: Does this look like something that I would have? Like, is this another druid doing a fog cloud spell?
Matt: You recognize this to be of similar size although magnified.
Marisha: Bigger than us?
Matt: A little--
Marisha: Than my spell. Bigger than my spell?
Matt: Bigger than the usual spell that you are used to casting but it does appear localized enough to be of a similar-type spell or effect.
Travis: Hey, Keyleth?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Quick question. Is there a d-- decor-- uh, like a proper way to announce ourselves?
Sam: Protocol.
Travis: Thank you.
Marisha: Well, I--
Matt: The ship suddenly lists a bit as you watch as Adella is now turning the wheel and turning the ship to try and veer around the fog bank that suddenly has appeared, and she's shouting off to some of her crew. They're starting to man the ballista at the back of the ship once more--
Laura: Is this normal? Is this a sea monster?
Matt: "Um. It's fog!"
Travis: (laughs)
Matt: "I have not yet encountered a monster that creates fog! But I'd rather not be caught off guard."
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait, this--
Sam: I can communicate with semaphore if that's something you'd like me to do?
Travis: What's semaphore?
Sam: It's communication with flags. It's a primitive communication technique that I learned in many of my studies, boat-to-boat it's really helpful. I pull out a couple of pieces of fabric and start gesturing--
Travis: Holy shit. You're that guy. (all laugh)
Travis: Where is the other boat?
Sam: Well, you just said to announce ourselves, I could announce. Vox--
Laura: I wonder if they can see through the fog?
Sam: -- Ma--
Travis: Yeah, we should have him do that. You should go to the front of the ship--
Sam: -- chi--
Travis: -- and just make sure they know we're coming.
Marisha: Can you do any flourishes?
Sam: -- na.
Marisha: Can you do any like tosses? Like color guard?
Sam: Oh, no, no.
Marisha: Oh, damn. All right.
Sam: That would be really cool, though.
Marisha: Sorry, Captain? How close are we to our destination? This could be Vesrah.
Matt: "From the recent calculations I made on our map, we're at least a day and a half out."
Marisha: Really? Does this look to be island-sized?
Matt: She's glancing over the front and-- you guys, by the way, are up there in the crow's nest and one of the ship hands is now climbing up the rope net to get to the top as part of his job--
Laura: It's a little crowded up here, but--
Matt: -- he gets up there and goes, "Um."
Laura: I hop on the broom and get out of it so he has more room.
Taliesin: I'm used to this enough, I know how to make room from last time I was on a boat.
Matt: He hops in and pulls out his spy glass and begins looking out. Shouts down to the captain. "Captain! It's moving!"
Laura: It's moving!
Taliesin: It's moving?
Matt: And you watch as she shifts-- the ship begins to turn wide to move around and the fog shifts to meet the direction of the ship.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Travis: Smart fog.
Laura: I just pull out an arrow and get ready.
Marisha: So it's coming towards us?
Matt: Mm-hm, or the ship is going towards it.
Laura: I'm going to tie off a rope to the broom.
Taliesin: Not a bad idea.
Matt: All right. She continues to try and move around, and the fog cloud shifts around, shakes her head and you hear as Adella shouts out, "All right, looks like we're going in. Be at the ready!" And eventually the fog bank hits the front of the ship, and within moments your visibility is cut to nothing.
Travis: What?
Matt: You can see no more than maybe a few feet past the edge of the boat, and for those at the back of the ship, the front of the ship is obscured. Those at the front of the ship, the back of the ship is obscured. It is a very, very thick fog that has completely immersed the outside of the ship.
Travis: Vax, don't try anything.
Taliesin: Everybody keep checking in.
Sam: I will flip a coin to Jumbo over there and tell him, listen, if things get hairy you might want to use this.
Travis: Use what? I can't see you.
Sam: Oh, God! Shit! (all laugh)
Marisha: I do another Gust of Wind and clear the ship deck and clear the path ahead of us.
Matt: Okay. They clear out, and slowly the fog begins to choke back inwards. Slowly, it does help temporarily, but as the ship moves forward basically you move past the area that you've cleared out a little bit, and the rest of the fog tends to envelop it.
Marisha: I'm going to see if I can see what this is from underneath the water. I'll be back. And I swan-dive off of the edge and into the water.
Laura: Did you say it over the earring?
Marisha: Yeah, bye. I'll be back. Bye! I'm going to do Alter Self to give myself little gills and little fin hands and go with the ship.
Sam: As I see her do this, I am going to alter myself to have the same.
Marisha: Oh! What's up, Tary?
Sam: I pick up the coin and hand it to Grog and say, this will make you fly. And I'll dive over the edge as well.
Matt: Okay, Tary gives a graceful, if a little clunkier, dive. In full armor, which makes it hard to swim.
Sam: Oh, shit. (all laugh)
Matt: But you can breathe underwater. It's medium armor, it's not too crazy, you're fine. But you with a much heavier splash. You look behind you, and see Taryon has met you in the water with the gills also kind of extending out of the sides of his neck. I would like both of you to make perception checks. (all laugh)
Matt: Make perception checks, please.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Sam: 16.
Marisha: It was cocked. It was right on a 20, which sucks. That's all right, perception check, 24.
Matt: 24. Okay, as you guys hit the water and go underneath for a second, you can see amongst the water, which is relatively still out here, and there's still the fog above, you see a slight displacement in the water.
Sam: Oh, there's something in the water, a boat.
Matt: Keyleth, you look over and you can see the displacement. There is nothing dark, but it's almost like something is pushing down into the water, or like there is a concave portion of the water.
Marisha: But nothing under the surface? Nothing breaking the surface tension of the water?
Matt: It is breaking the surface tension, like it's in-- as you glance over you can see there's what appears to be an unnatural break in the waves like a path.
Laura: Like it's invisible?
Matt: It's like another ship or something of that size is currently keeping in time with the Drensala Vis.
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: It looks smooth. It looks man-made?
Matt: Well, you don't see what's there. All you see is the break in the water.
Marisha: It's invisible. Okay, I come up out of the water and I use my earring to communicate that to everyone else.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Do you still have your fucking gills on?
Marisha: It's, you know-- I don't know, do I?
Laura: Does that mean you choke?
Travis: Yeah are you like--
Marisha: Can I communicate?
Sam: She has gills but she keeps her mouth and stuff right?
Marisha: I can still talk.
Matt: You can still speak, I'd say, once you break the surface of the water.
Marisha: Yeah I come out of the water and communicate it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You sound like Kim Carnes. Everybody, this is great. (all laugh)
Marisha: A little bit like Linda Blair.
Matt: All right, you guys hear Keyleth begin to inform you as you hear off to the left side of the ship two localized sounds-- it sounds like wood slamming into wood or some sort of a heavy impact, two in rapid succession. And you watch as from out of the fog two extremely long metallic jagged and almost like hooks or giant grappling hooks slam into the ship with chains behind them that suddenly grow taut. The rest of the crew begins to turn around and move their ballistas in the direction of where the chains come from, but you still see nothing there. The fog is too thick.
Liam: I'm going to hide.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Travis: And we can see the hooks, right?
Matt: You can see the hooks, yes.
Laura: Can we see the hooks from the crow's nest?
Matt: It's just out of view. You watch them pass through, and you see them arc below you, and then vanish into the fog. And you hear the impact and the ship kind of (impact noise) from the hit.
Laura: I want to try and hover down so I can see a little better.
Taliesin: Are you with me?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going to very quietly say that I'm going to grab onto your broom and head towards that end. I'm also going to activate the spider climbing boots.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I would definitely like to go and see the giant sea creature claw that just grabbed onto the boat.
Matt: Okay, you rush up to the edge of this giant claw that's hit it and you can see it's a thick-- like a dark iron pole maybe about that long--
Travis: Oh!
Matt: -- it's about that big around and has a large chain affixed to it that just progresses off that side of the boat into the fog. It looks like a series of giant hooks or curved spikes, and it has jammed and dug itself and dragged and caught on to the actual deck of the ship.
Travis: Good news, not a sea monster. Bad news, a big hook that leads to nowhere.
Laura: Get it off the ship. Can you pull it off?
Travis: Sure. So I'll try and lift the hook off the ship.
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check.
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15. You're lifting right now and it's not shifting. Unfortunately, the weight of both the ship moving forward, the tension on the chain and the hook, and the hook being so heavily dug into the deck, like versus that portion you're just not getting enough of a lift. There's too much torsion on the actual connection to the ship.
Travis: You know what, I want to see where this leads. I'm going to leave it here.
Liam: Fuck you, physics.
Marisha: I'm going to swim closer to where the chains are coming from and swim closer to the invisi-ship.
Sam: I join her.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Trinket's going to run up next to Grog.
Matt: Okay, so Trinket and Grog are now heading to the left side of the ship--
Travis: Hey, buddy.
Matt: --you guys are swimming in the water towards that direction, and you watch as suddenly what was once a slight displacement in the water becomes visible. And you see before you a smaller, more compact-looking ship, but it has a series of iron plates all across it in various places. It's armored from all directions, haphazardly. Not a beautiful construction per se, but made for function.
Marisha: I'm going to come up-- oh, go ahead.
Matt: You look up, and from what you can see on the edge of the ship, and you can see what appear to be two small gray crystals that are giving a faint glow, and it looks like they are actually creating and emanating this fog that is surrounding the space.
Travis: Awesome.
Taliesin: Fog machine.
Marisha: I'm going to come up and, in the path as the ship is going by, can I do a poof of Faerie Fire in front of it? To see if I can Faerie Fire the ship?
Matt: Okay, well, you can only Faerie Fire creatures in a small area, a ship--
Marisha: It's not going to do it.
Matt: --probably shouldn't be Faerie Fire.
Marisha: Okay, then I'm going to see if I can-- can I try and grab onto the side of the ship?
Matt: With just your fingers? It's pretty-- I mean-- okay, you know what, I will say because of the iron plating there is a little bit of a grip.
Marisha: The seams?
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: With your webbed fingers.
Sam: Can I join her on this?
Matt: Mm-hm. You can, indeed.
Marisha: Natural one.
Matt: You reach up and grab, and about three nails snap, and you lose your grip, falling back into the water.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: Oh, ow.
Laura: That's just mean.
Marisha: That shit hurts.
Sam: Athletics?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ten.
Matt: You barely hold on. You don't climb, but you hold on and watch as Keyleth just--
Sam: Oh! I'm alone. (all laugh)
Sam: Do I see her in the water?
Matt: You see her splash and disappear under the water below. The fog is starting to close around the area.
Sam: Shit. She can swim; she'll be okay. She's so strong and powerful.
Marisha: Do I see Tary?
Matt: You just went under the water. You come back up and you watch Tary vanish as you're now being left behind. The ships are traveling faster.
Laura: Keyleth, can you do anything about this fog?
Marisha: Yes! Once I track down the ship. I kind of swim up and I say, Tary can you catch-- this might be bad. Do I see any type of-- what are they called? Cleats. The ship cleats. Do I see anything like ship cleats? Right?
Taliesin: Yeah, no, that's right, it's the little prongs.
Marisha: Like the little things, the prongs. Do I see anything like that? I want to try and do a-- like a grasp-- like Thorn Whip myself to the ship.
Matt: You see one, it's a little ways up from where the ship is actually hitting the water. You would have to probably swim close enough to get there. I'm going to say, make an athletics check to see how quickly you can try and swim against the ocean just for this brief moment. You're going to have to roll pretty high.
Marisha: Well, that's not great. Just straight athletics?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Athletics is pretty good! 15!
Matt: 15?
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: I'll say you don't fall too far behind the ship, it's still going faster than you and the water is kind of up and down. Using your Alter Self gills, you can dive below the surface to try and avoid the choppiness of the ocean, and you come back up. What's the range on your Thorn Whip?
Marisha: 30-foot range.
Matt: 30-foot range, and it pulls whatever is there ten feet towards you. We can say it'll pull you ten feet towards it. So it gives you a slight arc, but not enough to actually reach the ship, you can just cruise past the grasping range of Taryon. So, Taryon, as you're there on the side and you glance over and you watch as Keyleth suddenly produces a large thorny whip, a druidic vine that wraps around the small cleat on the side of the ship.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: And you watch as she arcs out of the fog towards you, reaching her hand out in your direction.
Sam: I will--
Marisha: Tary!
Sam: Yes!
Marisha: Tary!
Sam: Yes, grab my hero's hand. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. You grab her hand--
Marisha: Tary! I want to apologize right now. Because in this moment, I am a damsel and I am in distress! (all laugh)
Marisha: So cross it off, bitch. Come on!
Matt: Make a strength check.
Sam: Okay. Okay.
Taliesin: Oh, please. Oh, please.
Sam: Wait, strength?
Matt: Yes, just a strength modifier bonus.
Sam: I'm feeling lucky! Yeah. (all laugh)
Sam: 19.
Liam: Hey!
Matt: Okay. All right. You grab her, and you-- it pulls you from two points, but you had managed to keep your hold and grasp Keyleth, now dangling from your arm.
Sam: I did a lot of pushups today! Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Matt: It is. You're very sore-- (all laugh)
Matt: You are very sore, but you manage to get her right up to the edge of the ship, and she manages to get a grip onto the edge.
Sam: I. Was amazing. (all laugh)
Marisha: You were. Today, in this moment, for this 30 seconds of time--
Sam: Augh! (all laugh)
Taliesin: I'm gonna be in the middle of this for months.
Marisha: --you were a hero.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be right in the middle of this. For months. Okay.
Sam: We'll omit that part. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Did it leave a little stain?
Sam: It's in my nose.
Marisha: Thanks. Okay.
Matt: You look up at this point and you can just barely see the chain, and you watch as a couple shapes, just barely visible through the fog, are now leaping across the chain towards your ship. So--
Marisha: I give a heads up. Heads up, heads up, people. Incoming forces, coming your way!
Matt: You guys in the ship, you glance over where the chains are currently pulling taut. You watch as a series of humanoid figures wearing dark, dark green and black leathers, their faces partially obscured, rush onto the ship, weapons drawn. I'm gonna ask everyone to roll initiative.
Marisha: Fuck. I hope these aren't my--
Travis: Right. You ran into our ship!
Marisha: --these aren't, like, my people, right? I haven't found out who they are.
Laura: I know! What if they are?
Travis: We gonna kill 'em.
Marisha: No!
Taliesin: Whoa! I don't feel good about that.
Laura: Look at that!
Marisha: Yay, it's a boat!
Travis: Boats!
Sam: There's a boat! Oh, wow, the top-down view looks so three-dimensional right now.
Laura: Yeah, really, it does.
Sam: It's really cool.
Laura: This is insane! This looks so 3D!
Travis: Well done, man!
Sam: 1980s graphics!
Matt: I can't take full credit for these. These were already premade
Travis: Aw.
Taliesin: This is like the finest arcade that I've ever been by.
Laura: This is so cool.
Travis: Which one's us?
Matt: All right. There's the two of them in the ocean currently off to the side.
Travis: You dingalings.
Laura: They can fly. They can fly. Oh my goodness gracious. This is so cool. What is this? What is that?
Matt: All right, so. Up in the crow's nest, we have Percy, one of the other shipmates, kinda up there. We have, down here at the wheel, the captain. These two, wielding two different ballistas.
Travis: At the bow of the ship, heading for --
Laura: -- a new land!
Matt: We have Doty, just hanging off to the side, watching and trying to take record of whatever's happening at the moment. Grog, where are you?
Travis: Wherever that grappling hook was.
Matt: That would be right here.
Sam: (roars)
Matt: With Trinket right by your side.
Travis: Welcoming committee.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: We're gonna eat it.
Laura: Me and Percy had said we were sort of on our way down.
Taliesin: Or actually, we had sort of headed towards the other boat.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Right, so you guys had made your way. So, yeah. So--
Taliesin: I was gonna ask you to drop me at the other crow's nest on the other ship.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: You need more iron in my diet.
Marisha: These are probably the Water Ashari, aren't they?
Matt: So you guys are heading this way? Are you taking him with you?
Taliesin: If you're down.
Laura: Uh, I was going to. I wasn't going to go all the way to the other boat, but I can. If you want to go with us.
Taliesin: Oh, please!
Sam: Toy boat, toy boat.
Sam: Toy boat.
Taliesin: Toy boat.
Laura: Toy boat.
Taliesin: Toy boat.
Laura: Toy boat.
Sam: Tor Books.
Sam: Tor Books, Tor Books. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Tor Books, Tor Books. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books. It's actually kinda hard.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Vax, where are you? Since you are hiding.
Liam: Well, I did a stealth check, and I got a 25--
Matt: Right.
Liam: I didn't know what the boat looked like, so if there's stuff in the bottom, I'd hide there, but if they're gone, I could also have gone up to the crow's nest. Whichever.
Matt: You could probably be hiding amongst one of the low sails probably. So we'll say you're up in this sail.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: In that vicinity. All righty. So. Bringing us now to the initiative order.
Taliesin: Oh, boy.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Liam: Shit.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Yikes.
Liam: (knocks on table)
Matt: 20 to 15?
Taliesin: 15.
Laura: 18.
Liam: 18.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Eee.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Twins.
Liam: Wapetopetok!
Laura: (explosion sounds)
Liam: (explosion sounds)
Travis: You both had 18?
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: Nice.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Travis: 14.
Matt: Grog. All right.
Marisha: Oh. 11. Sorry.
Matt: That's all right. Keyleth. And then?
Sam: Eight.
Matt: Tary.
Laura: Hey, look, some things don't change. (all laugh)
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: Burn!
Sam: Stings.
Matt: All righty. So. You watch as these figures just jump across from the chains that are lashed onto the boat, and as two of them make it across, suddenly, up the side of the ship, you watch as if a singular wave seems to (water rushing) and splash onto the edge of the ship. However, as the water crests and splashes into the ground, it forms up into its own physical entity.
Sam: Ooh.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Oh shit. Water elementals.
Matt: You've seen this form once before, that Keyleth has taken--
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: --this is a water elemental.
Laura: What if this is the Ashari?
Marisha: It probably is. Just haven't figured that out yet.
Matt: (laughs) Where did I last put it? All righty, so. That being the case, I'm gonna go ahead and pull these up there.
Laura: Did we say we did anything about the fog? The fog is still there.
Matt: The fog is still in this vicinity right now. So, you're under the effect of a Fog Cloud spell... for the area. So, basically, the area around is heavily obscured. So that will increase uh, AC to a number of individuals. Perfect. All right, so. So first off, this elemental rushes forward to Grog, splashes around in your direction. Grog, it's gonna go ahead and take a series of swings at you.
Travis: Sweet.
Matt: Yeah, it's gonna take two slam attacks. That is a 23 to hit?
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And an 18 to hit.
Travis: Hits also.
Matt: All righty. So you suffer 12 points of bludgeoning damage. That's full damage. You're not raging.
Travis: Nope.
Matt: And that is 15. 15 points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Total? Or 12 and 15 both?
Matt: 12 and 15.
Travis: Gotcha.
Matt: All right, that ends that guy's turn. Next up is Vax and Vex.
Laura: I was on my way over to the other--
Taliesin: Drop off.
Laura: -- towards the other ship.
Travis: Bludgeoning.
Taliesin: As long as you roll by, I'll just let go.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: You can drop me off.
Laura: Percy wants to be dropped off at the crow's nest, so I'll fly over that direction.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Keeping an eye out for anything visible that I can shoot at.
Taliesin: The minute I see a rope, I'll just let go and drop. So she can just keep moving.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say--
Laura: Flyby.
Matt: As you guys make it onto the other side of the ship--
Taliesin: You know, you could've spent your time making two very complex Lego pirate ships. All week.
Matt: You're right.
Taliesin: I'm just saying.
Matt: But I don't have that time, unfortunately. (all laugh)
Matt: Right, so you guys, right over to this ship here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You drop him in the crow's nest.
Laura: Uh-huh.
Matt: All right. And you are currently on your bow? Is that all you're gonna do?
Laura: I'm on-- yeah, I'm on my broom. I'm just riding my bow around.
Matt: Fair enough.
Laura: Can I drift down to where I can see anything and I say to Keyleth, Uh, fog? Can you do anything about the fog?
Matt: On their ship?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So as you coast down a little lower, I want you to make a perception check.
Laura: I like that one. 31.
Travis: Jesus.
Matt: 31. You glance down, and as the fog parts, you see on this ship, there are three other similarly dressed, dark green and black leather humanoids that are now beginning to rush over the chain, and standing back, on the back of the ship, arms crossed, you see a large humanoid with a fish-like head. It has no nose, a big fish-like mouth, big bulbous throat, kind of a greenish-blue skin color, very turquoise, with big fin gills at the side and a large crest that goes down the head. But it's wearing fine billowing silks, and a large vest, and its lower torso, from this giant oversized kind of plump belly, the lower torso is just this swirl of water that sits there, and it looks like it's currently concentrating through the fog on the opposite side.
Laura: Oh, jebus.
Matt: It does not seem to notice you at the moment.
Laura: Then, I'm gonna try to Bramble Shot that motherfucker.
Matt: It is right there.
Marisha: Well, that's pretty cool.
Laura: I'm gonna try to shoot a Bramble Shot at him.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Okay. 20?
Matt: 20? Hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Yes. Okay. Oh, Hunter's Mark. Motherfuck! That's okay, sneak attack.
Travis: It's all right, you've never played this game before.
Laura: Why? I can't help it, I get so happy. Okay.
Matt: Let's see. Actually, roll again. Because in the fog cloud you do have disadvantage on strikes.
Travis: Oh, that's cruel, man.
Laura: That's cruel.
Travis: (laughs painfully) Don't do it.
Matt: One?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Oh. That sucks.
Laura: That's okay. That's okay, I'm gonna try to do another shot. And in that downtime, I'm gonna fucking Hunter's Mark.
Sam: Yeah!
Matt: There you go.
Sam: Turn them lemons--
Travis: Into orange juice. (all laugh)
Matt: So this entity is currently Hunter's Marked, and you can take your second attack, if you like.
Laura: Okay. I can't do a Bramble Shot again 'cause that was wasted? Or does that mean-- Does a Bramble Shot only work if it connects?
Matt: I'm gonna say for the purpose of this Bramble Shot, 'cause it's only fair and it's a powerful vestige, it only works if it connects. That should change the wording on that.
Laura: Okay. Okay, I'm gonna try.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: 19?
Matt: 19 does hit.
Laura: Yes! Okay. 15 plus four lightning damage.
Matt: Slick.
Laura: Plus Sneak Attack. Woo, an 11 for the Sneak Attack and Hunter's Mark. And then the DC of 17 or be restrained. That's strength save.
Matt: Gotcha.
Laura: And I'm gonna do the Bramble Shot damage now.
Matt: That is a 13.
Laura: Hoo, yes! He's restrained.
Matt: Go for it, roll the damage. For Bramble Shot.
Laura: Ooh. Is that a sev-- that's a one. 16.
Matt: 16. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and make a concentration check on him. He succeeds. With a 26. All right, so, the first shot whips past and just slams into the ship. You watch as this giant fish entity kinda glances off to the side, looks down and starts looking up into the fog cloud, but you're right above it at this point, or just off to the side, and you fire your second arrow, it turns just in time to see it hit it in the shoulder, as it glances up, tries to snap it free. The wooden shaft of the arrow suddenly sprouts all these vines and thorns that begin to wrap around it and it tears in its body, and it's currently stuck in place. It cannot move.
Laura: Awesome. And I say, Percy, spellcaster, right below you. Fish guy.
Taliesin: (exhales) Got it. Not sure what to do.
Sam: Noted.
Matt: All right. So, ending that, we come to Vax's turn.
Liam: One of the assailants is directly across from me, on the other side of our boat, right?
Matt: There is one crossing right now.
Liam: But there is one guy who made it onto the boat?
Matt: There's two of them who made onto the boat, right there.
Liam: Right there? I'm gonna attempt to Assassinate that motherfucker.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, god!
Matt: So you're-- we'll say you're up over, you kind of shimmy your way along the edge of the sail, and you're looking right down below him.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: This guy right there.
Liam: So, advantage on this.
Matt: The guy closest to Grog, or the guy who's alone right there?
Liam: The one that you are touching right now.
Matt: Okay, gotcha.
Liam: Yeah. So that is a 32 to hit.
Matt: That will hit.
Liam: So this is Assassinate, it's an auto-crit--
Matt: Did you roll at disadvantage because of the fog cloud?
Liam: Well, no, but I'm at advantage because of Assassinate, so the first roll was a 19.
Matt: Yeah, so you're fine.
Liam: Which is still a 32. Here we go.
Laura: I get 2d6 now for Sneak Attack.
Matt: You do. So roll another d6.
Laura: Another six!
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: Hey, that die!
Matt: That's 48 points of damage in one hit.
Laura: Bramble Shot, motherfucker!
Liam: Doing my maths over here. 32, 36, 72. That's 80 points of damage.
Matt: 80 points of damage.
Travis: What the fuck? No wonder Tary almost died.
Liam: Is he still standing?
Matt: No. (all laugh)
Travis: Assassinate!
Matt: Just leaps off the chain and pulls out what looks like-- for this, it would be a dagger and a rapier. Glances around and goes lunging in for the captain of the ship. Gets maybe two steps, before your blade sinks into the back of the neck. And he just hits the side, and collapses, right at the edge of the ship right there. Done.
Liam: Okay, just for funsies I will throw my second dagger at the one right in front of Trink.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So, that is not that good.
Laura: Ooh.
Liam: That's a 13.
Matt: Okay, yeah. Even with disadvantage. Okay. So this one you fire, and just disappears off to the side of the ship, but returns to your belt. Are you gonna stay where you are?
Liam: No, I'm gonna drop down.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And circle around Trinket's tush.
Matt: All right. Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Sure.
Matt: Just to land from the top there.
Liam: Yeah, 25.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine. So you move around behind Trinket. All righty.  That ends your turn, Vax. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm gonna take a quick look around to see if I can figure out what's causing this fog because it's annoying me.
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: That's a 19.
Matt: Glancing about in the area, it's hard to see, especially from this vantage point. The area is so heavily obscured with fog. You do glance and see what looks to be a very, very faint general glow in a lower area towards the edge of the ship. But that's all you can make out.
Taliesin: Starboard? Port?
Matt: It'd be on this side.
Taliesin: All right. Somebody take a look at anything. There's a glow coming from the starboard side of the enemy ship. It's the one closest to our ship. We need to find out what's causing this fog. In the meantime, I'm gonna slowly make my way down a couple of the ropes. Is that an enemy right there? That guy?
Matt: You're up here.
Taliesin: Yeah, I know. I'm asking if that's an enemy on our ship, right there.
Matt: This is an enemy right there.
Marisha: The water elemental.
Matt: These are enemies. These are your guys, the guys with the red cloaks; the red color signifies your own crewmates.
Taliesin: Okay, so we have two enemies that are currently on their ship.
Matt: Two enemies in their ship, one that's currently crossing, and one that is on the other side.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm gonna slowly start making my way, just maybe a few feet down, and I'm going to shoot those two people who are on the very edge. Both of them in the back.
Sam: There's no honor in that.
Taliesin: No. There is, on the other hand, fine comedy about to happen.
Sam: True, true.
Taliesin: I'm gonna very, very carefully. And I'm at disadvantage with this?
Matt: Disadvantage with each strike, yes.
Taliesin: Oh, that's annoying. Okay, I'm gonna use the pepperbox, the Animus, and I'm also going to burn a Grit for a push.
Matt: For which one of these guys?
Taliesin: What about one on each?
Matt: One of these two?
Taliesin: Both of them. I'll start with the first one, and work my way down.
Matt: Okay. First one there.
Taliesin: All right, so, let's see what happens.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies!
Taliesin: That will do. That's a 28?
Matt: 28 will hit.
Taliesin: And that's-- I'm sorry, you know why I'm a little confused, I just had to switch, again. That's, wow--
Marisha: That's good.
Taliesin: -- that's good. That's 17 points of damage and five points of psychic damage.
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: And he goes ten feet away from me.
Travis: Ah.
Laura: Oh!
Marisha: (yelps)
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: As he's trying to step across the chain--
Liam: Wilhelm scream.
Matt: (gunshot)
Marisha: (Wilhelm screams)
Matt: He gets blasted. And (Wilhelm scream) just plunges off the side of the chain, loses his footing, tumbles over, and vanishes into the fog. And you hear this splash, a moment later.
Taliesin: Next! I love boats.
Matt: So this guy? Disadvantage on this shot.
Taliesin: Yep. Here we go. That's, oh that's good, 29. I'm rolling really well.
Matt: Yeah, that will hit.
Taliesin: Not as well as yesterday, but really well.
Marisha: (singing) I got a nautical themed, pashmina Afghan.
Taliesin: And that's five, six  that's 11 points of damage and five points of psychic damage, and a ten-foot push.
Matt: All righty. Okay. He also (snapping sound) falls off, grabs the chain, catches it with his finger, but because of the sea spray and the fog, it's too slick and (slipping sound, Wilhelm scream) just falls.
Taliesin: I was just gonna say, he's happy to grab, and I'll deal with that too.
Matt: Yeah. But they both have fallen off the ship.
Marisha: That's what she said? No.
Taliesin: I can make him drop things. I have that power.
Marisha: Oh. My god. Drop the chain they're holding on to?
Taliesin: I've been wanting to watch somebody holding on and make them drop it. I've been wanting to do that for like, probably a year and a half now. God, is there anybody fun on our side?
Laura: The fish guy.
Taliesin: You've got him grappled.
Matt: You've one guy walking across, right now, on the chain, and the guy below you who is grappled, and the water elemental that's also attacking you.
Travis: Yeah, don't you get advantage on grappled guy?
Taliesin: Technically I would. That would cancel out, wouldn't it?
Matt: He is restrained, which means attacks on him are with advantage, so it would cancel it out.
Taliesin: It would cancel it out automatically. Oh. In that case, I'm gonna take a shot on him.
Laura: And it'll probably get a chance to be unrestrained as soon as it's his turn.
Taliesin: Okay, good point. So, I'm gonna take a Sharpshooter shot. I'm also going to-- is he holding anything?
Matt: Not that you can see.
Taliesin: That's good. And he's a magic? Yeah, that will do. I'll just take a good old-fashioned Sharpshooter shot. So that's-- that's not as good. That's 18 to hit?
Matt: 18 to hit? Just barely hits.
Taliesin: Oh, thank god. Okay.
Liam: I hope these aren't your cousins.
Marisha: They might be.
Taliesin: Well. They were a little--
Travis: Nobody's tried talking yet?
Marisha: We'll figure that out.
Laura: We're kind of being ambushed. So...
Taliesin: That's kind of heavy. That's gonna be 24 points of damage, and three points of psychic damage.
Laura: I don't think your cousins are fish people.
Marisha: My cousins might be fish men.
Liam: They could be werefish or...
Marisha: They could be anybody. They could be werefish.
Matt: Gotcha. Okay, so you managed to fire (gunshot) the third shot out from Animus. You see it blasts into the upper shoulder and back portion of this fish-like creature. (growls) It does not look terribly happy. But it is currently still bound by the various thorny vines that have wrapped around it. End your turn?
Taliesin: Yeah, and I'm just gonna crawl a couple feet into the ropes in that direction.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm just gonna keep rope-swinging. There we are.
Matt: There you go. All righty, that brings us to Grog.
Travis: After getting hit by the water elemental, can I go, Hey! What do you want?
Matt: The water elemental just (gurgling growls).
Travis: Fuck it. You got saltwater in my eyes; I would like to rage!
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I go into a rage.
Marisha: It's not me, Grog. It's not me.
Travis: Oh, I hadn't thought about that. (all laugh)
Travis: And I beat the shit out of it with the dwarven hammer. Two hits.
Matt: Go for it. Two strikes.
Travis: Are these at disadvantage? Or I'm right up there?
Matt: No, you're melee, you're fine.
Travis: Hey! Reckless attack.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, my.
Liam: Hells yeah.
Travis: 23.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Nice. 17.
Matt: 17 damage. Okay. Now your last strike?
Travis: God, those are balls! They're not literal balls. 22.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: Nice!
Travis: 24. 24 points of damage.
Matt: 24 points of damage? Okay, nice. So you start bludgeoning its watery form. Even though you see the water splashing around, and it's soaking everything in the vicinity, you are still watching as each blow forces the creature to kinda shift and move, and you hear this (gurgling sound) kind of dull thud sound, and a pained noise seems to emit from this elemental creature with each impact.
Travis: You can do better than that.
Matt: Does that end your turn?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. That brings us to the rest of the crew. So these guys-- the water has now pushed them past a bit. They are moved and they're starting to try and swim their way to the edge of the ship, and they're starting to actually-- Let's see what their rolls are for their athletics. Natural 20, nice. Okay, so they both make their way up to the side of this side of the ship and latch onto the edge, right beside Keyleth and Taryon.
Sam: Oh, great.
Marisha: Can I say something to him?
Matt: Yeah, as both (grunts) get out of the water, they're pulling up right alongside you, pulling blades out.
Marisha: Hi! Kaitiyaki. Water Ashari?
Matt: You hear them just growl as they pull their blades out, and continue.
Marisha: Hm. Hm.
Liam: Kick his ass.
Travis: Yeah, we tried to talk.
Matt: So for this one, each of them are gonna make two strikes against each of you with their rapiers.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: Taryon, that is a 21?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: And a 21.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: I rolled the same number twice in a row. So you take--
Travis: What's your AC there, big guy?
Sam: 15.
Matt: Nine points of piercing damage and five points of piercing damage.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: As it just thrust--
Sam: Ow!
Matt: -- holding onto the side of the ship's armor, thrusting the rapier into you, scraping past your armor. One catches you in the hip.
Sam: Ugh.
Travis: Ooh.
Matt: Keyleth, the other one's gonna make two strikes against you. That's gonna be--
Marisha: Cousins?
Matt: An eight?
Marisha: No? Oh. Nope, that misses.
Matt: And a 27.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: And that's gonna hit you for ten points of piercing damage.
Marisha: Okay. That's-- yeah.
Matt: And it looks like their ascent has stopped and they're just right now happy to just continue to pierce these two stowaways that are gripping onto the side of the ship. This one stumbles across the rest of the chain. And turning and seeing you guys there on the edge, Vax as you dart around the side of Trinket, it's gonna move, avoid the bear, step across, and attempt to attack you twice with the rapier, once with the dagger.
Liam: Sure.
Marisha: Jeez Louise.
Matt: So the dagger's gonna be 11?
Liam: No.
Matt: Not very good.
Liam: That's a no.
Matt: However, that is a 26.
Liam: That hits. Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: And a 19.
Liam: No.
Matt: No. All right, so, they get one rapier strike towards you. That is going to be nine points of piercing damage.
Liam: Halved.
Matt: As it just cuts across the center of your armor in the midsection. It doesn't actually get the skin, but it's enough of an impact where you can feel a bruise coming.
Liam: Tight.
Matt: All righty. Ending their turn, that brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. Am I still on the side of the boat?
Matt: You are, yes.
Marisha: I'm gonna climb up that boat.
Matt: Okay, make an athletics check.
Marisha: Ooh, that's good, 17 plus my athletics, which is good, which is seven, so 24.
Matt: Okay, so you get up on the edge of the ship, it does get one attack of opportunity against you as you move up. It's gonna slice at you with a rapier. That is gonna be an 18.
Marisha: Miss.
Sam: Whoa.
Matt: Nice.
Marisha: No. Hit. Sorry.
Matt: Okay, there you go, that's all good. That is ten points piercing damage.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: As the rapier just catches you in the back, and you're like (groans), and you climb up and get back onto the edge of the ship. As you glance around, you can see that there is the weird fish-looking guy in the center of the ship right now. It's currently bound by the vines around him.
Marisha: Any sign that these could still be my people? Pretty certain they're not.
Travis: I think you can let that go now.
Matt: You're pretty sure there's not much of a tribal sign--
Marisha: Nothing?
Matt: -- that resembles anything Ashari-related universally.
Marisha: Guys, real pirates! And then I'm going to do Control Water. And I'm going to raise water 20 feet around me, and start sinking this bitch. I want to sink this ship. 20 feet, just tidal waves coming over the boat, and I'm sinking it.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Control Water, what level is this?
Marisha: Fourth level.
Laura: We could steal this ship. Okay.
Taliesin: It might have stuff.
Marisha: Nope. I'm sinking it.
Matt: Okay, as you get on the edge you begin to pull your arms up, and as you do, you hands begin to glow with a dull blue-turquoise color, similar to the skin of this fish-like creature, and it glances over at you, and its jaw opens. You can see this burbling sound as the edges of the water begin to rise up and splash and pour into the ship, perpetually filling the lower, usually air-filled section of this ship. And it begins to immediately (thud) list a little bit to one side.
Marisha: Do I have any movement, or is that it? Probably getting up is my movement.
Matt: That's gonna be your action, and climbing up is gonna be your movement. So that's kinda where you are.
Marisha: Okay. Cool.
Matt: You can maintain concentration on it.
Taliesin: We're gonna want to break the chains.
Marisha: I maintain concentration.
Matt: You get the sense, it's gonna take a few rounds, but if you keep at this, you'll probably have a  good chance of achieving your goal.
Marisha: Cool. It's what I like to hear in life, in general.
Laura: You might bring our ship down with it, Keyleth.
Travis: If you keep at it, you might be able to achieve your goal.
Marisha: No, it's localized.
Laura: No, but, the chains attaching two ships.
Marisha: Eh. We've got time.
Taliesin: That's the correct response.
Liam: She says as she destroys everything.
Travis: Yep, yeah, yep.
Marisha: Destroy reality?
Matt: Ending Keyleth's turn, it is now the crew's go. So the crew here is gonna turn the ballistas around, as the captain leaps off down and goes behind the guy who attacked you, Vax. She pulls out a scimitar, rushes forward screaming, "Yah!" and just does a full downward arc into the back.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Liam: Adele Dazeem, ladies and gentlemen.
Laura: Like Xena. (war cry)
Marisha: Adele Dazeem.
Laura: What does Xena do? (Xena fighting call)
Matt: That is 18. That hits.
Travis: That's it.
Liam: Yeah, that's it.
Matt: Second strike is a 23. Both hit.
Liam: She also breaks hearts.
Laura: Left and right.
Liam: Left and right.
Taliesin: Oh, man.
Liam: You can relate.
Travis: Disappointed!
Matt: That's better. 24 points of slashing damage. That ends her turn. These two guys are gonna fire ballistas at the ship. (firing sound, splash)
Travis: Yes! Yes!
Matt: One of them unfortunately just coasts off to the edge and misses the ship.
Travis: Damn it! He's fired.
Matt: The other one is a natural 20.
Travis: Boom!
Laura: Damn!
Matt: Oof, that's gonna be nasty. That, yeah, okay.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: That is 42 points of damage--
Travis: Damn. From one of the ballistas?
Matt: -- to the side of the ship. You watch as one of these ballistas has a similar-looking, like, giant iron arrow, but it's designed to just split and destroy wood on impact. It's pierced, but it seems to splinter out, so it hits, and then breaks as it goes.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: And as it slams into the side of this ship, just above where Taryon and the other guy are. You watch as it (crashing sound) slams and wood splinters and breaks. The impact shakes the side. I'm actually gonna ask both you and that guy to make a strength saving throw.
Travis: Come on, buddy.
Sam: That's sorta cocked, but that's okay, I'll take it. That's a five.
Matt: Okay, both of you guys--
Sam: Maybe I'll use Luck, and go again.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Sam: Ooh, yeah. Yeah, that's ten.
Matt: Okay, that's two. That's enough to hold on. The other guy did not make it. So you just hold on from the impact, the other guy (screams) falls back and splashes into--
Sam: You should've worn boat shoes! (all laugh)
Matt: Perfect.
Laura: I like to picture you in full armor with boat shoes on.
Marisha: Boat shoes on!
Matt: As you hold on, you watch as the ballista, which has a chain attached to the back of it as well, is now being ratcheted back. And as it slams through and is pulled back, it's tearing sections of the ship apart. And you can watch now, as it's pulling down and breaking a whole section.
Sam: Jesus.
Matt: That's gonna go ahead and end this crewman's turn. This guy is gonna go ahead-- crossbow and try to line it up, towards-- I can only see the guy below, with disadvantage. Oh, it's a shame, it's a natural 20. And a 19, actually. Still manages to hit, even with the disadvantage from the fog cloud. Okay, that's eight damage to that guy. All righty. And then this guy over here is gonna move to the water elemental and take a strike on it and misses. (whoosh) It goes and strikes, but the water elemental shifts out of the way, the blade moves past, without an impact. End of the round, we have Taryon.
Sam: Yeah!
Marisha: Taryon!
Sam: Yeah! So, the guy right next to me is gone, right?
Matt: Yeah, he's splashed back. Both of these guys are in the water, back ten feet.
Sam: Oh, they're gone. Okay.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Okay, Can I see? No. I'm gonna climb up.
Matt: Okay, athletics check.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Watch this go bad.
Sam: No, no. It's okay. 16?
Matt: Yeah, that could climb up and get onto the edge of the ship, right next to Keyleth, who's currently concentrating. You see her eyes kinda glowing, and her hands glowing with this faint aqua-look as the water is now, immediately to the right of her, curling up and splashing over the bow of the ship, and just pouring into the ship below.
Sam: So cool. So cool. Okay, I just yell back to Doty, Get rid of the grappling hooks! I don't know, I have no idea what I'm doing.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And then I see that the giant thing in front of me, right? Do I see the thing?
Matt: You do see it, yeah. It's currently bound by the series of thorny vines.
Sam: Great. I'll reach into my magic bag, and pull out a vial of acid and just throw it at the thing.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack. It is restrained, so you have advantage on the ranged attack roll.
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: What do I add?
Matt: Add your-- it should say under the class.
Sam: My spell attack bonus?
Matt: It should say under the class's ability.
Sam: It says--
Matt: What's your bonus next to it on your sheet? Under your attacks.
Sam: Oh! Oh, it says--
Matt: It should be there.
Sam: No, it doesn't.
Matt: Doesn't? Ah, damn it.
Sam: Oh, wait, no, it says it. But it's cut off. It says, "DC one". I'm sure there's something after that, but are you talking about just to hit it?
Matt: Right. It's their saving throw. It's your spell DC to get past it; I think is what it is. It's not an actual ranged--
Sam: Okay, so then it's 17.
Matt: 17? Okay, good to know. Which, he has disadvantage on it, which he rolled a one in the first one, so no.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So go ahead and roll full damage.
Sam: Great, so that's 7d6.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: LED six!
Laura: They're really pretty.
Taliesin: They're really fun. Yeah, I like it. I know.
Marisha: LED. Six.
Sam: 26.
Matt: 26 points of acid damage.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: That's good.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Does he let out a fishy scream?
Matt: You watch as you lob your vial, it (shattering sound) burst across the creature's chest--
Taliesin: (gurgling)
Matt: --and the acid (burning sound) begins to burn, burning part of the vines that currently keep it restrained, but--
Sam: Oh, shit! Sorry, sorry! I don't know how this stuff works!
Matt: But it does burn. You see it (gurgling grunts) trying desperately to break free, as you see the smoke of its burning flesh rise up off its body (sizzling sound).
Sam: Okay.
Matt: End your turn, Taryon?
Sam: I have a bonus action. I'll use Sanctuary. On myself.
Matt: Okay. There you go. And with that, Doty's gonna go ahead and reach down and try and grab-- nope. Not with a four. As you see, (creaking noise) you hear the metal kind of creaking, but not getting any sort of actual--
Marisha: Aw.
Taliesin: Knees, not back.
Matt: I know.
Travis: Lift with your knees.
Taliesin: God, robot!
Matt: All right, ending that round, that brings us to the top. The rushing waters: the ships continue to move forward; both of these guys shift backward.
Liam: Bye!
Matt: They're being left behind by the boats.
Taliesin: Good!
Matt: They're trying to swim forward. That brings us to Marid. Okay.
Taliesin: I've been waiting for this so for pretty much a few months.
Matt: So this guy is currently up in the side. And he's looking around, he's gonna make a quick perception check, just to look around. He got shot by you. He got shot by you. He's gonna go ahead and glance up in your direction. He's gonna go ahead and use a Water Jet ability against you.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Actually, let's see here--
Travis: Water Jet.
Laura: (explosion sound)
Matt: You know what, now? No, he's not.
Travis: He's not?
Matt: He is, but he's gonna use a Water Jet--
Laura: Is he not grappled anymore?
Matt: He's still grappled. He's restrained, but he can still do abilities.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: We're fine.
Matt: 60, fine. Yeah, you're up there, but it sees the cluster in that direction. That's his own guy. He won't do that.
Travis: He wouldn't?
Laura: Ooh, honorable.
Matt: Hold on, I'm trying to see what's the most useful--
Sam: Maybe they're family.
Laura: Maybe they are.
Matt: He can't move. He can't angle it. It's really frustrating for him.
Liam: For him, right? For him? It's frustrating for him.
Matt: Yeah, for him.
Travis: It really frustrates him.
Matt: And for that, he's gonna aim for Trinket and Vax.
Laura: What is he doing, what?
Matt: Aiming for Trinket and Vax.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: So, all of a sudden, it turns its head this way, opens its mouth (hoarse gasp) and you watch as this small spiral of  greenish energy begins to swirl. And a singular burst of extremely accelerated water just (hard impact sound) fires through the fog out of sight. You hear this (whoosh) sound, and you turn just in time to watch as it blasts towards both you and Trinket. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, and Trinket as well.
Liam: Vax or Vex?
Matt: Vax.
Liam: Vax. Yeah, you're fine.
Laura: Yeah, I'm fine.
Liam: Oh, you're doing Trinket, right.
Laura: Whoa! Trinket rolled so good!
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17?
Laura: Hold on, hold on, holda.
Sam: Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda.
Laura: Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda. 20!
Matt: All righty. So Trinket manages to (whoosh) duck down, taking half the damage.
Laura: He was very zen about that duck down.
Travis: (Trinket groans)
Laura: Matrix style, he's diving in. No.
Matt: So 15 points of bludgeoning damage to Trinket. 30 to you, Vax.
Liam: But halved, 'cause if I fail, it's halved. If I succeed, it's zero. It's a dexterity so it's Evasion.
Matt: Yeah. Evasion--
Liam: Evasion is for dex saves. If I fail, I take half damage, and if I succeed I take no damage.
Sam: Ooh! That's sexy.
Matt: Right.
Liam: It's how I survive dragon fights.
Matt: Yes, yes.
Travis: (singing) How I survive dragon fights.
Sam: Guys, we're having a water battle.
Laura: You guys!
Taliesin: I've been waiting for this for so long.
Laura: Well, we're having a pirate battle.
Travis: Super soaker!
Sam: Super soakers!
Taliesin: Super soakers!
Travis: Super soaker 250, super soaker 500, super soaker 1000. You remember those?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Sam: Yeah. I didn't know they had gauges.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage. However, you are pushed 20 feet away and knocked prone.
Sam: Ooh. Ooh.
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Off the ship?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: (whoosh) Off the edge of the ship.
Sam: Oh! No!
Laura: (gasps) Bro!
Matt: He (splash) into the water below. (splash) It's with such force, that you aren't even given a chance to grab at the ship. You're thrust off at an arc.
Liam: Mm-hm.
Matt: And (splash) into the water. (splash) into the ocean--
Laura: Gosh, thank god Trinket ducked.
Matt: -- soaking you down into the wave. The elemental creature swirls up and occupies both the space of Grog and Trinket, and is going to go ahead and turn it into a whelm. So it's going to uh, attempt to whelm both of you, and I need you and Trinket to make strength saving throws.
Travis: Strength saving throws. I have advantage because I'm raging. 26.
Laura: 18.
Matt: All righty. You guys, both pushed out of its space. So it forces you out. However, you both manage to escape any sort of damage as its giant spiral, this whirlwind of water spins around and you both barely force your way out of it before it can do any serious damage to you.
Laura: Bearly.
Matt: All right, that leads us to Vax's turn.
Liam: Okay, so in the water, click the boots, and the wings shoot-out, and I explode up, out of the water into the air.
Sam: Wow, so cool.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And I just start gunning it towards the guy who knocked me in, right?
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And when I'm about, I don't know, 30 feet away from him, I'm gonna-- because I'm hasted I get 120 feet of movement just for regular movement.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And when I'm within 40 feet, I'm gonna throw Whisper at the guy.
Matt: Okay, that will put you about there.
Liam: Yep.
Travis: Hit him. Hit him!
Liam: That's 26?
Matt: 26? All righty, that hits.
Liam: And I'm gonna bamf right up to him as I hit.
Matt: (poof)
Liam: That is just a little ten, plus-- 15.
Matt: 15 points of damage with that strike. Okay.
Liam: And I should have one more. So I used bonus action for the wings, I did movement, I did action, so I've got one more action.
Matt: Your offhand attack, yeah.
Liam: Yeah. So I will shank him again.
Travis: Shank shank!
Laura: Shank shank!
Sam: Is that a new thing? Shank shank?
Matt: You have advantage on these strikes now. Because you're right up against him, and he is restrained.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20 hits. And you do get your Sneak Attack, because of your advantage on him.
Travis: No more dagger dagger dagger.
Sam: Just shank shank?
Laura: It's just two. It's shank shank.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: That is just a nine! And I'll unload some poison into him as well. The DC is 15.
Marisha: I feel like 'shank shank' is less attractive on a t-shirt.
Matt: That is a nine. He does not succeed!
Liam: Okay, so he takes 2d10. Do I roll that, or do you, Matty?
Matt: You roll that.
Liam: All right.
Matt: So what's the damage initially?
Liam: It's nine. Plus 13 poison damage.
Matt: Okay, so 22. Are you gonna roll Sneak Attack damage?
Liam: Why would I get that here? Is he up against anybody?
Matt: No, you have advantage on him because he is restrained.
Liam: Oh, advantage, yay, I love you.
Matt: And he is not immune to poison.
Liam: 20 Sneak Attack damage. Thanks, Matt.
Matt: How much is that total?
Liam: 20 for the sneak attack.
Matt: 20 for the sneak attack. 20 plus 22.
Laura: You're attacking the guy?
Matt: We'll see if he maintains concentration.
Laura: How'd you get all the way over there?
Matt: He does not. So. Let me double-check one thing real fast, here, because this will be interesting.
Liam: Shank-shank-shank. Shank-shank-shank.
Liam: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Taliesin: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Laura: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Marisha: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Matt: Okay, got you. So he loses concentration. He is now poisoned and restrained. He has to make a saving throw, actually, to see-- which he did not. So yeah, still restrained.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Whoof. That sucks. Okay, that ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Awesome.
Liam: Get him!
Laura: Cool, then since he's got my brother next to him, I'm gonna fly down so I can see him better, and shoot him two times with my blazing bowstring on the first one.
Liam: She shouts as she flies through the air.
Laura: Blazing bowstring! Activate!
Marisha: (electric guitar sounds)
Laura: Do I still get disadvantage?
Matt: You do, the fog is still present.
Laura: Okay. 28.
Matt: 28 hits. Second attack?
Laura: Second attack is just-- can I do regular?
Matt: Yes, that's fine.
Laura: 18.
Matt: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.
Laura: 12 with three points of lightning damage.
Travis: Did you add your Hunter's Mark?
Laura: I'm about to. 13 additional. And then ten with the blazing bowstring-- nine more with the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Nice, all right.
Laura: And then my second attack--
Matt: Correct.
Laura: 11 plus three lightning.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: I don't get Sneak Attack again, but I do get Hunter's Mark.
Matt: You do get Hunter's Mark, yes.
Laura: And three more for Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Nice. So, after he's stabbed in the side, and the poison pulses through his system, turns around, and as the arrow slams into him, burst of flame and lightning arcs through his body.
Laura: And I'm gonna fly back a little so he can see me less. And then I'm going to have Trinket, for my bonus action--
Marisha: (gasps)
Laura: -- run forward and attack the guy on the edge of the ship.
Liam: Is it a leap year?
Marisha: This hasn't happened in like 20 games.
Laura: I know, I know.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Matt: Is Trinket doing just a regular attack?
Laura: Yeah, because it's my bonus, so he can just do one attack.
Matt: Because if you wanted to, instead of going for a damaging attack, you can go for a shove.
Laura: Oh, I could? I didn't think I was allowed to do that.
Matt: Yeah, you can do it, you can sacrifice an attack for a shove strike. It doesn't do damage.
Laura: I want him to do that. That's what I wanted him to do.
Matt: I was wondering if that's what you were going for. Okay, so go ahead and roll an athletics check for Trinket.
Laura: Athletics... is that strength? That's just five.
Matt: Five? Okay, yeah, so Trinket goes up and slams into the guy, and he gets pushed against the side of the ship, but not with enough force to shove him over the edge, and he (grunt) catches himself.
Laura: So Trinket just stands up, he's got his paws on his chest.
Matt: Just pressing (growls) on there, yeah.
Laura: Growls loudly into his face.
Liam: (growls)
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Percy, you're up.
Laura: I mean, that's scary, a big bear. Especially if these guys are on the sea. They don't see bears very often.
Taliesin: All right. That guy's still in the vines, right?
Matt: Correct, yes.
Taliesin: He's becoming a problem, though. Okay, I'm going to, if I can pull this off, is it possible that I can break the rope that I'm currently holding onto and do a little Errol Flynn like fly down to the bottom of the boat?
Matt: You can do that, yeah.
Taliesin: Is it possible that the rope I have to shoot is in between me and him?
Matt: Uh... sure.
Marisha: You going to kill two birds with one stone?
Taliesin: I'm going to use a piercing shot, and I'm going to try to do both with one shot and Errol Flynn this shit.
Travis: Oh shit! Oh shit!
Matt: Okay. Make an acrobatics check as part of this.
Marisha: Errol Flynn this shit, is that what you said?
Matt: This is specifically the kind of shit acrobatics is for.
Travis: Totally. 100%. Swashbuckling.
Taliesin: Acrobatics... that's a 23.
Matt: Yeah, go ahead and take it-- still at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Still at disadvantage.
Matt: Because of the fog.
Marisha: Oh man, now you're in an Angelina Jolie movie.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: Nope?
Taliesin: So this is gonna be funny, because I was using the Animus.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: So depending on how mean you wanna be here, I'm gonna take my 2d6.
Matt: Oh, you misfire?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: So this is gonna be funny. I'm gonna take my 2d6, and that's six points of psychic damage to me, that's cool, that's cool.
Marisha: What if one day you died because of that?
Matt: Okay, so you use your piercing shot to shoot both at him and to shoot the-- or to shoot the rope and then swing down?
Taliesin: Yes. So does the psychic damage mean I let go of the rope I'm holding on to? Or does it not? Also, my feet are sticky and my hand has--
Matt: Your feet are sticky, but your hands are not.
Taliesin: But my hands are not.
Matt: It's the blast of psychic energy. You know what? I'll say go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm down for this.
Matt: Yes, make a wisdom saving throw to see if you can withstand the blast to your brain as your vision goes white.
Taliesin: So that's an eight.
Liam: Goes in the drink.
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: Here's the next question  do I have any chance of grabbing anything with my hands and feet on the way down?
Matt: Unfortunately, no. What happens is, as you grab the rope and you fire-- as you slash the rope and go to swing down, you go to fire, and as you do, it backs up, and your vision just goes white and you feel your whole body go instantaneously numb. You're not sure if you're even holding the rope anymore. All of your--
Taliesin: So I'm just gonna wake up on the deck of the floor of the boat.
Matt: -- and the pain sears in your brain, you hear the (heartbeat) the pulse of pain through, and as your vision comes to, it clarifies, and color comes back just in time for you to see the surface of the ship rocketing towards your face. (impact sound) And you slam into the ground, straight across, landing prone at the base of the ground in front of the fish creature.
Laura: Oh, no!
Travis: It was so cool!
Laura: That one was seriously bad.
Sam: Can I yell out, No! New best friend!
Matt: You can. You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage from the fall.
Taliesin: 12 points of bludgeoning damage. And can I burn a bonus action, am I okay, or--
Matt: You could use-- I mean, that was your action, you land, yeah. You're still prone, but you can still use the rest of your attacks if you want.
Marisha: I'm sorry, your best friend?
Taliesin: I can use the rest of my actions?
Matt: I mean, that was an attack. The piercing shot. So you still have your two other attacks, if you wanted to use them.
Taliesin: Just because it hurts and I'm irritated, I'm just gonna pull out Retort and fire in the general direction.
Matt: Okay, so two more strikes, both at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: (gunshot sounds)
Taliesin: Oh, that's not bad.
Marisha: What the fuck?
Taliesin: 28?
Matt: 28 hits.
Marisha: That's not as good.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 does not hit.
Taliesin: Okay, so the 28 one does, though. That's seven points of damage.
Matt: Seven points of damage. Got it. Okay. So as you roll over on your back and pull out Retort and just fire two shots, one just goes off into the fog. You see it tear through the ship mast for a second, some wood splinters, the other one, you hear the creature take the impact from the blow. You're not even really paying attention where it's going, you're just hearing the sound and shooting in that direction. All right, that'll end your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: What a turn. What a terrible way to go.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: I wanna keep hitting the water elemental.
Matt: All right. So, you turn towards it over there. Go for it.
Travis: Reckless attacks, please.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: First one's a 30.
Matt: That'll hit.
Travis: 21 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Second attack. It's very methodical. 26.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Does that hit?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: And 17 points of damage.
Matt: 17 points of damage, all right. So you rush in and slam twice in this elemental again. You see its form with each hit is just splattering water against the ground, and where once it came up as this solid force of water, it's starting to have difficulty keeping its form together. Where once it was focused genuinely on you and Trinket, it seems to be lashing out now in a frenzied state, it's just punching all around. Does that finish your turn?
Travis: Am I not good enough to hold your attention? Yeah, that finishes my turn.
Matt: Okay. Got you. All right. This guy here's gonna squeeze past the side.
Laura: Trinket attacks him on the way over.
Matt: He hasn't moved away from Trinket yet.
Laura: Damn it.
Matt: Actually, no, he's gonna squeeze this way instead because Grog's on that side. He's gonna go ahead and move past the bear and let Trinket push his weight into the side of the ship, and is going to go ahead and take three strikes at you, Grog.
Travis: Yay!
Matt: With advantage.
Travis: Another play-friend.
Matt: That's gonna be two strikes against you and one against Trinket. First one with advantage is gonna be a 24.
Travis: Hits!
Matt: Dagger is gonna be a 15.
Travis: Misses. With advantage too?
Matt: Yeah, his first attack roll was a one. All right, so you take ten points of piercing damage, reduced to five.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And then the other rapier attack's gonna go against Trinket. Which is a natural one. Jesus.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: So he just swings and Trinket catches the blade in his teeth, and he draws the rapier back, which is now covered in bear slobber.
Travis: This is not the time to choke, buddy.
Matt: That ends his turn. This guy here is gonna go ahead and turn to face off with Captain Adella. He's gonna make three strikes against her.
Marisha: C'mon, Adele Dazeem.
Matt: That's gonna hit. First rapier strike, second rapier strike, and the dagger, all three hit, unfortunately.
Laura: We're all such dicks.
Travis: You guys are awful.
Marisha: We've got these shitty nicknames for everyone.
Matt: 14, and, okay. Total of 21 points of damage on her.
Travis: 21 points.
Matt: So as she tries to parry to the side, the pirate just catches her off-guard and gets three good hits in, but Adella parries off to the side, gets pushed back a bit, and then forces her way forward, preparing her counter-attack.
Travis: Come on!
Matt: That brings us to--
Travis: We should probably protect the captain.
Matt: -- Keyleth.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, shit. We're still attached to this boat, right?
Sam: Multiple times.
Matt: Currently, yes. If you're still concentrating on this, the water's still pouring into it.
Marisha: I am. How much slack do we have before I start pulling our boat underwater, because I don't want to be that-- kinda thought someone would start--
Matt: It depends, right now it'll be probably two rounds before it begins to genuinely start sinking heavily. Depending on if the ballista get another shot at the side or not.
Marisha: I wanna keep doing this. Can I concentrate my flooding of water so-- there's now a hole in the side of the ship, under where Tary was, right? I had to think not to say Scanlan.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: I wanna flood in more water. Can I flood it more on this side, to where I try and-- or can I do something fancy, like a giant hand of the gods from the wave come up and--
Taliesin: Kind of like Fantasia?
Marisha: -- take the fish-head guy?
Travis: What the shit?
Marisha: Or can I at least try and flood that side to where I can try and toss him over?
Matt: You can either choose to continue to flood the ship, or use Control Water to attack the fish character. One or the other.
Travis: Don't look at us, man.
Marisha: Let me see if I can Control Water and take a wave to toss him overboard.
Matt: Toss him overboard?
Laura: He's a fish! That'll help him.
Marisha: He is a fish.
Matt: He is very plainly a fish-based creature.
Marisha: He is very definitely a fish.
Matt: The lower half of his body is a swirl of water.
Marisha: Oh, right.
Travis: So put him in the water.
Laura: I don't think putting him in the water's gonna help us very much.
Travis: Water and water makes--
Marisha: You know, I'll just keep sinking this ship.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm gonna keep concentrating.
Laura: You could get rid of the fog.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I can't do that right now.
Matt: The torrent of water continues to shove down into the ship. You've redirected it. As it's pouring into the side, you use your other hand to pick up another portion of water and start spraying it into the wound that was left right above, Taryon, you're getting sprayed by water overhead as it's just traveling over you like an Epcot Center water fountain.
Marisha: You're good, right, Tary?
Sam: Yes?
Marisha: All right.
Sam: This is so weird!
Marisha: Good! This is like a Tuesday for us.
Matt: All right, so the crew on this side, this guy's gonna go ahead and move up higher up there and take a swing. Misses, unfortunately. This guy's gonna take another crossbow shot down at the one that's attacking the captain. That will hit, actually.
Travis: Yes! Get him!
Laura: Get him!
Matt: All righty. And then these two guys are gonna take two more ballista shots as they load up, pull it back. This guy continues-- actually, this guy doesn't get a shot, because he spent the last round winching and pulling it back, so he gets one shot retracting. This guy managed to pull it back and take a secondary shot at the ship. That hits. It's not a critical, but it's still pretty decent. That is 14 points of damage on the side of the ship. This one slams into it maybe about five feet to the left. Keyleth, actually all of you who are on the ship, you feel the impact as the second blow hits, and it pulls out the side, this time much lower, and water is now really pushing, the ship is slowly starting to capsize to one side. That ends that group's turn.
Sam: I've read about this. Many of us will die. (all laugh)
Matt: Tary, it's your turn.
Sam: My turn?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Okay. Is there water all over the deck, is it hard to move, is it okay?
Matt: I mean, it's wet, and the deck is currently listing to one side.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Is it listing towards Keyleth and--
Matt: It's listing this way.
Travis: Boat shoes!
Sam: Yeah, those are like impervious to water. (all laugh)
Sam: Okay. Once again, I'll yell back at Doty and just say, Ahh! The thing with the grappling hooks again!
Matt: Doty actually does succeed this turn. (all cheer)
Matt: Doty lifts it out, and now that it's starting to pull, the chains are very taut, as this ship lists, the ship's being pulled a little ways towards it, the chains are strained, so as soon as Doty pulls it up, it just goes firing off the side and plunges off the water to the other side. The ship's now beginning to slowly turn this way as the other chain is now tugging it from that direction, and this is now listing to that side. So, what are you doing, Tary?
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to cast Haste as my action. And I get a second action, now, because I'm hasted, right?
Matt: You get to use a second action that's a melee attack.
Sam: It has to be a melee attack?
Matt: Melee attack, disengage, hide...
Sam: Can I use-- it said I could use a magic item.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Or use an item, use an item.
Matt: Yeah, use an object.
Sam: Oh, use an object, not an item. I can't use my ring or anything, right?
Matt: I'll say, for the purposes of this? Sure. Why not?
Sam: Okay, so I'm hasted, I will use, I pick up the Ring of the Ram, and I'll ram the fish-man.
Travis: Oh, yes!
Laura: Oh, nice!
Matt: Okay. How many charges does it have?
Travis: Ring of the Ram, that's been a while.
Sam: Three charges, right? So I can use two?
Matt: You can use as many charges as you want that the ring holds. It should tell you up to a certain amount--
Sam: It has three charges.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Well, it says I can use an action to expend one to three of its charges. Okay. I'll do all three, right? (all laugh)
Matt: All right. So, it is still restrained, so go ahead and roll with advantage an attack roll plus seven.
Sam: Ooh. 19.
Matt: With advantage?
Sam: Oh. Natural 20. (all cheer)
Matt: Oh, shit. Well. Okay. Roll 6d10 force damage.
Travis: Holy shit. 6d10?
Taliesin: How many do you need?
Matt: Well, then we double what he rolled, because it's a critical.
Marisha: Six, you need six?
Travis: And that's force damage.
Sam: Okay. 35. 70.
Matt: 70 points of force damage against the creature. So as you focus on your ring, there's a burst of divine white-looking energy that turns into this giant plate-like shield in front of you, and it just stays there. You're like, huh? And suddenly it thrusts forward, and out the front of it, like a portal, a giant spectral ram-head just slams into the chest, throwing it off the ship, as it screams, it just turns into sea foam. (all cheer)
Travis: You killed it!
Matt: It's scattered into the ocean across from you. It is destroyed.
Sam: Can it be like a kid who's holding a rifle, but not up to him, so it hits him and it really throws me back a little?
Matt: Which, yeah, sure. Roll a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Off the ship, into the water.
Sam: Yes!
Matt: Splash! Into the water.
Travis: Back in the drink again!
Marisha: Are there still bad guys left?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: There are. There's two over here, and there's two currently in the water below. Ending your turn--
Marisha: But nothing left on the ship, right?
Laura: That we see?
Marisha: That we see?
Matt: Correct. These guys are trying to swim forward. That was cocked. Nope. These guys, at the top of the round, get pushed back.
Marisha: Bye!
Matt: Taryon--
Sam: I lost Alter Self when I hasted.
Matt: Yeah, so you're just generally swimming, but you also float back in the ocean. You're now caught in the water behind, so the ship carries on without you.
Taliesin: And that was the last anyone saw of Taryon Darrington. (all laugh)
Matt: All right.
Marisha: He got his $50,000 worth.
Matt: The water elemental's going to go ahead and take two slam attacks.
Sam: You there! Hello.
Matt: It's taking a slam attack against Grog, it's taking a slam attack against the pirate.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So against Grog, it has advantage on you because you used reckless.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: That is a 23.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: 16 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to eight.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And against the pirate, that hits. And the elemental reaches around, and as it punches Grog in the face, it slams the other pirate in the head, its fist engulfing his head, and he just kind of stands there, trying to find a way out, and it just drowns him while it's standing, and it drops the body to the ground.
Laura: Oh, fuck.
Travis: Oh, it killed him?
Matt: Yeah, it lashed out.
Laura: One of our guys?
Matt: Did enough damage-- no, one of the pirates.
Laura: Oh, shit. He is untameable.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: You know when you look at a cat that's alarmed because it's nervous and all the hair is puffed out? Vax's feathers are all going like pffft, watching Keyleth wreck the boat, I could fucking watch you do this all day. Up into the air, and I go and get Tary out of the water.
Sam: Aw!
Matt: You go grab Tary.
Liam: And I'm gonna pick him up and dump him back on our boat, towards the back of the ship.
Matt: Okay, carrying him, we'll say you're at half speed, so that gets you just to the edge of the ship.
Liam: Cool. I'm good. Wait, no, do I have an action left? Can I use Divine Sense right now?
Matt: As you're hasted, you have the haste action...
Liam: Yeah, I am hasted.
Matt: I'll say you can use Divine Sense, sure.
Liam: Okay. I pat him down and go, we're good, we're good, and I'm just gonna make sure he's not a demon.
Matt: Oh. Taryon.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: A demon? What?
Laura: Why a demon?
Marisha: What? Why would you think he's a demon?
Sam: Guys, the conclusion of the epic series Shades of Magic, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so go pick it up. It's put out by Tor books, a leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over three decades.
Matt: Okay. That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'll fly over to Percy, who's on the fucking ground.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And I say, are you good?
Taliesin: It was worth it. Good.
Laura: Lovely. Get off this boat. And I'll fly over and try to help out the fight on the other side.
Matt: Okay. We'll say that's 20... 40... yeah, you can get over here.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You'd still be just above the fray.
Laura: And then I'll shoot some arrows at--
Matt: There's one guy left, and the elemental.
Laura: I'll shoot 'em at the guy.
Matt: Okay, go ahead for two strikes on that.
Laura: Yeah. Oh, disadvantage, too?
Matt: The fog is still around, so yes.
Laura: Oh, damn it. Okay.
Travis: Oh, one of them was a--
Laura: Yeah, but. 20 on the first one, and 15 plus seven on the second one. 22.
Matt: Both hit. Roll damage.
Laura: Awesome.
Marisha: You have a d3?
Sam: I need a d3.
Taliesin: It's a d6.
Marisha: It's a d6 cut in half.
Sam: Wait, two, four, six or something? Okay.
Laura: Oh, Jesus, this is terrible, this is terrible.
Taliesin: There is actually a d3 that has two ones, two twos, and two threes.
Laura: 17. Plus three lightning damage. And then... 16 plus two lightning damage. And then for my bonus action, Trinket's gonna-- and it was Sneak Attack, because there's something next to him, huh?
Matt: Correct.
Laura: (cackles) Five for sneak attack!
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And then Trinket will attack him too.
Matt: Roll an attack for Trinket.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: (bear noises)
Laura: Yes. That is-- what is that, a bite attack?
Matt: Whichever one you decide.
Laura: Sure, it's a bite attack. A 24.
Matt: That hits. Roll damage.
Laura: It's 11.
Matt: 11. As both arrows staple, one into the guy's knee, he falls down to the ground on one knee. The other one hits him in the side of the body, and he looks up just as Trinket chomps down over his head. (all cheer)
Matt: And just crunches down. You watch as his skull collapses with the force of the bear's jaw, and the arms just go limp at the sides. (all cheer)
Matt: Trinket then shakes him a bit, and his limp body just goes whoompf, whoompf, just slamming and breaking into the side of the ship, and then drops it on the ground, and Trinket turns around and looks in your direction.
Laura: Good job, boy!
Liam: That made us all so happy.
Laura: Yeah, it's great.
Marisha: See a guy get thrashed.
Laura: I wish Scanlan could've been here to see that.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: 87 episodes. One kill.
Laura: He's had more than one.
Matt: Two of the guys are trying to swim, but they're not able to keep up. You just watch them slowly vanish behind you in the fog. All right, Percy?
Taliesin: The water elemental's still a problem, I take it?
Matt: You can see it still lashing out, yes.
Travis: And there's one hook left.
Taliesin: I'm going to stand up, dust myself off, pull out Bad News, take careful aim-- slightly irritated aim at that water elemental, and see what happens.
Matt: Go for it. Disadvantage on the shot.
Taliesin: Disadvantage on the shot.
Travis: Has the fog not dissipated because fish-head got done with?
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Not yet. I'm actually going to spend a grit to gain my advantage back.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Taliesin: Come on. Thank god I didn't do that too weird. That's 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Taliesin: I'm also gonna blow through most of Cabal's Ruin, 'cause that's funny. I know, I say that a lot. So that's standard damage, is 15 points of damage, plus where is--
Marisha: 1d4 plus four... 1d6 lightning damage per charge expended.
Taliesin: Okay, 1d6 per charge. You know? Let's end this. Should we just end this?
Marisha: That's good. Lightning's bad for water. Not that I'd know.
Taliesin: I figured it would be. I'm just gonna blow eight of the charges, so do you have five more--
Marisha: Yeah, I do. Five more, of course. Dream come true, make it happen.
Laura: If this doesn't end it...
Taliesin: So plus (counting) 23 points of lightning damage on top of that.
Matt: Okay, so as you bring Bad News down and aim across the way, fire the bullet, it blasts across, and you guys see this glow of electrical energy that just shoots through the air, the bullet enhanced by the Cabal's Ruin vestige enchantment. As it blasts into the side of the elemental, the elemental gets blown back through the air, and as it does, it just vaporizes. (all cheer)
Marisha: Is that everyone done?
Matt: All the enemies currently seem to be not on the ship, or dragging behind. However, (creaking noise)
Taliesin: I'm going to stop, I'm going to wave, and I'm going to go walk over and start looking to see if I can see what that glow is. I'm going to deactivate this, because I want to loot this ship.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: Ooh, that's better. That's 25.
Matt: 25. You glance in the side, and you see now, there is a singular small palantír-type orb, but smaller, that is a foggy gray color on the inside that's slowly swirling, and you can see it's gathering condensation and mist around it.
Taliesin: Does there seem to be any mechanism for turning it off or otherwise?
Matt: It looks like it's just embedded into it.
Marisha: Take it with us, take it with us.
Taliesin: I'm going to at least try and pick it up, and--
Matt: Make a strength check.
Taliesin: Okay.
Liam: While he's busy, I'm gonna jet over next to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Oh, are we in combat rounds?
Matt: We're going to stay in order for a second.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Matt: There is a bit of a--
Taliesin: That's adorable.
Marisha: That's sad.
Taliesin: Three.
Matt: (straining sound) You feel something pop in your back shoulder, and your right arm gets a little numb.
Taliesin: That's so mean. (all laugh)
Liam: It's like when you just reach out to pick up something--
Marisha: Yeah, you never know. Getting old, man.
Taliesin: There's no way to--
Matt: As you go over to it, you see it's there, but it's currently held in place by something that's beneath the orb, or at least it's either adhered or glued to or held there, you just don't have the strength to lift it.
Taliesin: There's gotta be a way to turn this off.
Matt: So that's your turn.
Marisha: I shout to--
Matt: It's Grog's turn, actually.
Marisha: Sorry.
Travis: I go over to the harpoon hook, and like, fuck this harpoon hook. Can I try and get it out of the ship with my strength?
Matt: Sure, go ahead and roll a strength check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Hey. 25.
Matt: One-handed.
Laura: Hey!
Matt: (tink, fwoomp) And it just flies out of your grip from the tension out of the ship. You have to pull your hand back 'cause the-- one of the giant gnarled edges of it almost take your arm off in the process.
Travis: (gasp)
Laura: You almost lost that gauntlet!
Matt: It tears a section of the edge of this boat off. Just the railing on the side kind of pulls through it immediately.
Travis: I'll pay for that.
Matt: Trinket has to pull off to the side and the one guy kind of backs up immediately as it shoots off into the water below. For you guys, the ship, now that it doesn't have the tension to the side, is now capsizing very quickly and turning on the side.
Taliesin: Oh, god.
Travis: I feel like I did something bad.
Marisha: That was cool!
Travis: Oopsie.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I say  Hey guys! Cruises are really trashy! (laughs)
Travis: Jokes while you're doing that.
Marisha: And I still have Control Water going.
Liam: Tip your waiters.
Marisha: Can I flush out the bottom of the cruise ship and bring whatever treasure is up out of the bow with what water is there? Just kind of (whoof)?
Taliesin: Like a spigot.
Matt: You're kinda off to the side. You can look down, it's not very well-lit on the inside at all. Like, it is not lit on the interior. You do have your elven darkvision for a few feet, so you have to glance over and look into the room below, but right now all you're seeing is seafoam and ocean pouring into the side of the ship.
Marisha: Okay, I stop sinking the boat. Because we're not dying.
Matt: Okay. The ship is still sinking. You filled it with water, and currently the side of it has been blasted twice.
Marisha: I bring the water up like a fountain of wealth and youth. Just coming up. Out of the bottom. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Wow.
Marisha: Just other way.
Liam: Oh, boy!
Marisha: Seeing what comes out from the bottom of the ship.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Hopefully not dead bodies or like--
Taliesin: (sings) It's rainin' men...
Laura: I know, if there were slaves--
Marisha: Slave trade or something sad-- yeah, like slave.
Laura: Fingers crossed. Let's not do that to Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, come on!
Travis: It's just kids!
Marisha: He's looking at his notes like it's a thing!
Travis: It's just kids.
All: (laughs and groans)
Travis: Kids and puppies!
Marisha: That's my worst nightmare!
Matt: You're terrible!
Travis: Kids and puppies!
Liam: Gosh!
Matt: Okay, so as the water comes rushing up from underneath, you see a lot of genuinely soaked food items come shooting up, large chunks of broken wood, what appear to be additional iron ballista spears.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: And lots of chain come firing up from the inside.
Marisha: Watch your head! Points!
Matt: Furniture, chairs, occasionally (water sound effects) just pieces of broken things from the interior. You're not seeing much else than that at the moment.
Marisha: Aw. These were lame pirates! No treasure.
Taliesin: Let's get the orb at the very least.
Matt: (sarcastically) Good pirates keep all their treasure on their ship at all times.
Marisha: Lame! (all laugh)
Liam: Just hundreds and hundreds of NES classics.
Laura: We really should've kept one of them alive.
Travis: Do you wanna check the captain's quarters before it all goes down?
Laura: Yeah! What if there's a map to treasure?
Liam: (sighs) Looks like it's going down pretty fast, though, yeah?
Travis: Those of you on the boat--
Taliesin: Doing it now-- yes, we want to it now while there's an order of operations based on a die roll!
Marisha: I have control! I have control!
Matt: Taryon!
Sam: Yes?
Matt: Anything you wish to add to this circumstance? You're now soaking wet, but your winged savior has lifted you down onto the edge of the ship.
Liam: (ting)
Taliesin: (sings) And I would do anything for love.
Sam: How many of you can fly?
Liam: Two or three, give or take.
Sam: Amazing! Incredible! Stupendous! No, I have nothing to add, other than-- do you need my assistance in cleaning up any of these ruffians? Oh, also, one question.
Liam: Yeah?
Sam: Did I hurt the beast?
Liam: Man, you did great! You knocked that guy clear off!
Sam: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: I killed it!
Liam: That's a good start, man.
Sam: What was it?
Liam: What was it?
Sam: Yes!
Liam: Oh, you need to ask the white-haired one. I dunno.
Sam: Okay!
Taliesin: Oh, that's me!
Sam: Was it bad?
Liam: The worst!
Matt: All right, so you spend your turn conversing.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: Pretty much!
Liam: Six seconds of dialogue, right there!
Matt: All right, we'll say for the pace of things here, guys, the ship is maybe 30 seconds from fully sinking into the water. Anybody you guys wanna--
Laura: 30 seconds?
Liam: I'm gonna do what I said before, and I'm gonna go and land next to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: See if we can grab the orb. I'm gonna run downstairs and see if I can see paperwork in the captain's quarters or anything-- or run in the captain's quarters and just do a massive loot, really, just as quick as I can.
Matt: Investigation check with disadvantage. The room is currently tilted pretty heavily, and everything has slid and collided onto one side of the room. It's just a giant pile of broken furniture.
Marisha: I said I balanced it out and that I'm kind of doing that.
Travis: You want me to jump over there and go get the orb?
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: We also kinda put a bunch of holes into the side of it.
Matt: Yeah, there are a bunch of holes in the ship--
Marisha: So I can only do so much.
Matt: Your Control Water can localize some cool effects, but overall the ship itself has taken too much damage.
Travis: Can I use my boots of Feral leaping to leap from one ship to the other?
Matt: Sure, make an athletics check.
Laura: I want to fly down and help Percy investigate. If there's time.
Liam: We're pretty flush already. Let's make it quick.
Taliesin: Well, there might be something magic. Okay. My investigation check is 19.
Matt: 19 with disadvantage?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Nice! All right, pulling from the inside and rummaging through, you find--
Taliesin: Any papers I'm just gonna grab.
Matt: Yeah, you grab whatever papers you can, there's a small leather tube, you grab that. Looking about inside, there's a ring of keys. You find a bunch of scattered coins throughout the room. It looks like there was a couple of small chests that just opened up and--
Taliesin: I'm looking more for magic, I don't care about gold-- magic or weird.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: Catch the eye. Are the keys, like--
Matt: They look like some sort of opening device, yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, no. Okay, yeah, I'm gonna grab them anyway.
Matt: Okay. So you grab the keys. Cool. All right.
Travis: 22. To jump across.
Matt: To jump across, okay. So you make it across, and you try and go underneath now. The ship, now, not only is it listing to one side, but it's starting to lift up a little bit.
Marisha: I try to balance it as much as I can.
Matt: So you're slowing the process. Slowing it.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Make my way to the orb. Rip it out.
Matt: The ship is also slowly moving behind the other ship, as it's no longer maintaining speed. All right, so what are you doing?
Travis: I'm trying to make it to the orb that he was too weak to pull out--
Matt: Strength check.
Taliesin: I hope you pull something in your knee.
Travis: Hah! 25.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: (popping sound)
Travis: I got it! Throw it in the water?
Taliesin: No! Let's keep it, let's bring it to the other ship.
Marisha: Put it in the Bag of Holding, Grog.
Travis: In the Bag of Holding.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And I run, and I try and jump back to the other boat.
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: I'm not gonna make it, but--
Laura: You might.
Liam: You might.
Travis: 23.
Matt: Five, ten, 15, 20... You catch the edge and are dangling on the side of the ship as your fingers are right there.
Liam: Looney Tunes!
Travis: (breathing hard) I'm good.
Sam: You could have flown.
Travis: I swallowed the coin.
Matt: Percival, water is now starting to spill in underneath you, and you're now about knee-deep inside, and everything's-- all the papers that you haven't already grabbed are soaked and floating up at the top.
Taliesin: I'm gonna run out. There's-- oh, man. I don't hear anything coming from down below, do I?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Did you ever hear that I wanted to go help Percy investigate, was I able to do that?
Marisha: Please tell me I didn't kill someone innocent again.
Matt: Yeah, you could fly over. Because you're behind him. As you rush in to help him, he has a couple armfuls of things, the room is now about knee-high with water and is tilting heavily to this side, and there's just floating bits of paper and soaked books and pieces of broken wood and furniture-- the room is utter chaos.
Laura: Anything interesting?
Taliesin: Yeah, I don't know. Hold on. I'm gonna listen for it.
Marisha: Hopefully no innocent people.
Taliesin: Perception check.
Sam: (muffled) Help me, I'm an orphan!
Taliesin: You're terrible. 17.
Matt: 17? You take a listen. Through all the splashing of water, the sound of wood creaking, and the ocean outside, you don't hear anything.
Laura: What are you listening for?
Taliesin: I show the keys. I'm worried there's a cage down there. I still have the spider boots, so I'm holding on.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can I hear anything with my elven ears?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: You've got an elven perception check.
Liam: They're taking the hobbits to Isengard.
Laura: What do your elf eyes see? Oh, nothing.
Liam: It was a one.
Laura: It was a one.
Matt: Okay, yeah. You go down and listen, and as soon as you do the water splashes up into your ear, and you get a bunch of salt water in the ear canal. Up in your nose a bit. You're like, ugh.
Laura: That was awful. We should get out.
Taliesin: I'm gonna hand her a bunch of stuff, including some of my things, and be back-- I'm gonna try and see if I can just--
Matt: Spider-boot down.
Taliesin: Spider-boot and see if I can hold my breath and look.
Laura: Don't drown, Percival.
Taliesin: I'm gonna grab, and try and use the lenses on my mask to even get a clear shot of what's under there.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I'm just trying to visualize with the last ten minutes that I have of Control Water to clear the bottom of this passage.
Matt: So you can do that. You can prevent, slowing the sinking, to part water.
Marisha: The rushing-in, that's what I want to do. I wanna part right where Percy's heading.
Matt: Okay. As you do that, the ship begins to list even further back and at an angle, and you watch as the front of it comes upward, and everything on the ship begins to slide past--
Travis: Yes!
Matt: -- in the direction of Keyleth and Vax.
Marisha: Sorry, physics.
Liam: Get off!
Matt: Can I have you both make dexterity saving throws, if you could.
Marisha: What, me too?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Jesus F. Christ.
Matt: A bunch of barrels just (rolling sound) in your direction.
Marisha: Oh, that's not too bad. Just straight dex saving throw. Plus five.
Liam: Natural 20.
Marisha: What did I roll? 16.
Matt: Okay, yeah, you both manage to just sidestep out of the way as they tumble past and splash into the water below.
Taliesin: Get out of here, you two!
Matt: You're starting to lose your footing a little bit. You probably have one more round before you just start sliding off the edge.
Liam: Let's go, man!
Marisha: Quick, quick, quick!
Taliesin: I'm fine. Vex is here, you two leave.
Matt: Percival. Perception check, as the water separates in the room.
Taliesin: Yeah. That's what I'm hoping for.
Marisha: Aw, you rolled a 19!
Taliesin: That's 26.
Matt: Okay. As you push down into the chamber with the walls of the water to the sides-- as you look down, and most of the furniture that was thrust up out of this area is cleared out. You do see two cages in the far back, one of which is empty. The other one does seem to have some sort of humanoid inside.
Taliesin: I'm going for it.
Marisha: Come on.
Matt: Okay. You rush up to the cage, and you look inside and you can already see what looks to be a slumped-over humanoid. You see no features, and there's no light down here, and your human eyes don't make out a lot of detail. The fact that you rolled so high-- it's only the little bit of light comes down here that's reflecting around.
Laura: Shit.
Taliesin: I've already got the keys in my hand and I'm just going to start going for it.
Matt: First key, nothing. Second key, nothing. Third key, noth-- (creaking sounds)
Sam: Cut the red wire!
Matt: Water begins to pour in from another side, and the ship itself is pulling back. I want you to go ahead and make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Come on, Percy. Come on.
Taliesin: I'm going to choose to use a Resolve. That's a save, isn't it?
Matt: That's for a saving throw.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Travis: Why didn't you roll the snitch?
Matt: What did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a one.
Matt: A natural one. You start getting the keys in, and there's probably a good 15 or 16 or so keys on here, and you get through about six of them before the ship itself has gone into a fall, and the cages begin to slide--
Taliesin: Okay, I'm rolling. There's someone in there, but I can't get it! And I'm going to spider-climb on the upside, on the wrong side of the wood and stay out of the water and crawl out.
Liam: Was he under water, or was the water--
Matt: The water is being parted by Keyleth, currently.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The cage is beginning to slide now, towards the back of the ship.
Taliesin: I don't know what to do. And I'm running out, I don't know what else to do.
Matt: Okay, so.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: There's someone in a cage. I don't know what to do!
Liam: I'll fly at that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Are you going? I'm gonna try whatever last bit of Control Water I have to try and part and calm the waters where Vax is going, and I say, go Vax, go!
Matt: Okay, so you just fly in?
Liam: If there's a cage, I'll go to it.
Matt: As you rush down inside, you watch as these two large, heavy cages are tumbling in your direction. An empty one slams just past you, and the other one slams into that, itself turning up a bit, and something inside slumps to the side of the bars.
Marisha: I'm trying to calm the water as much as I can.
Liam: Can I even see the lock or where the keys were?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: All right.
Matt: The keys you do not have. Percy has--
Taliesin: I have the keys, but none of them were working.
Liam: That's a 21.
Matt: 21. You manage to, as you leap up using your wings in little bursts-- this is a small, enclosed space, you can't use too much of the air to fly. In what little bit of parting of the water's being done, you catch up and climb onto the top, and you can see the cage has turned on its side, and the doorway is on the top. So you can see the actual lock.
Liam: All right. While I'm hasted, do I have an action left to get up there and pick it?
Matt: I'd say yeah.
Liam: Yeah? Okay.
Laura: Go, go, go!
Marisha: Go, go, go!
Liam: 32.
Matt: You reach out and pull out your picks, and as you look up-- Keyleth, at this point you're parting the water, but the ship is now sinking, and you are-- you're sliding off.
Taliesin: I grab. Can I make a jump to grab?
Matt: You can. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Marisha: And I'm just holding concentration, hoping someone catches me.
Taliesin: My dexterity-- save or check?
Matt: Either.
Taliesin: They're both the same. It doesn't matter.
Marisha: That's good, that's good.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: Just catch Keyleth as she's about to slide off the edge, and you hold her there. Now, I will not require a concentration check from you, however, you're about to both go under water.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: You're holding her at the edge of the ship. You get the door open. It slams over on the side. And looking down inside, you can see what appears to be a slumped-over, soggy mess of a person. Unconscious.
Liam: Okay, can I keep going here, or--
Matt: Yeah. Grab them, pull them up, fireman's carry--
Liam: And then just try to slowly, messily float him up and out of here.
Laura: I want to go help if I can.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, there's not much room for flight, it's more like--
Liam: All right, so pull.
Matt: -- leaping through, as you make your way there. You just get up onto the edge as the water goes past both Percy and Keyleth. You guys, your faces just (splash) beneath the ocean water.
Marisha: Yeah!
Liam: I shout out, Twinnie!
Laura: I help, I help, I help.
Matt: You rush down from the broom. He goes and flings the person over your lap, and you take up on the rest of the ship as the boat now is completely submerged. You watch the tip of it just (splash) beneath the water. Bubbling the water up around as--
Marisha: I drop Control Water, switch back to my Alter Self, grab Percy, head back to the boat.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: While this is going on, I'm asking Captain Adella's crew for towels. Could I get a towel? Or some sort of-- I'm really wet, here.
Matt: They're all on the edge of the ship, watching this happen. With one in the crow's nest, keeping an eye out. And they're not paying any attention to you.
Sam: I'm just worried that this will rust if I don't get it dry soon, so if I could get some towels, or maybe someone to fan it off, that would be great. Thank you.
Matt: All right. No response, but you are eager to repeat your question. As you make your way over, Keyleth, you pull Percival-- because both of you guys sink quite a bit below with the ship. As soon as it goes under, it goes under fast, and as soon as you glance up to watch that Vax makes his way out, and you can just see over the surface, you relieve that to start swimming up, and both the two of you-- you release your boots, and begin to make your way to the surface. It takes a moment, and you just get to the cusp of what you can hold your breath, before you both break the surface. Percy takes a deep breath, and you guys eventually swim your way over towards the edge of the boat. The fog, by the way, has begun to dissipate now, and has been slowly doing so since your removal of the orb from the edge.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: As you guys all manage to make your way back onto the surface of the ship, waterlogged and tired, we're going to take a break for the restroom.
Travis: Nice! A fight at sea!
Marisha: A fight at sea!
Travis: We made it off the Titanic!
Taliesin: I fell off a boat.
Liam: This is stupid, Rose! This is stupid!
Travis: This is stupid, why would you do that?
Marisha: Like Battleship, but better.
Matt: So we'll be back here in a few minutes. We do have a Wyrmwood giveaway for you guys in the chat room. Be active in the chat room, just you have to use the phrase 'Wyrmwood', w-y-r-m-w-o-o-d,  in the chat room, once they initiate the actual contest, and we'll come back from the break with the winner. So we'll see you here in a few minutes, guys.
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role! First off, thank you again to our evening's sponsor, Tor Books!
All: Tor Books!
Matt: For coming out and sponsoring this episode, make sure to check out A Conjuring of Light, the conclusion to the Shades of Magic series is now available. Also, we had a contest in the chat for this fantastic mahogany dice vault by Wyrmwood, the winner is Terrythesortofgamer. (all cheer)
Matt: Congratulations, Terry, we're gonna go ahead and get this signed and shipped out to you ASAP. Thank you all for entering, we'll have more giveaways in future episodes as well as Talks Machina on Tuesday with Brian Foster. Anyway, let's bring it back in.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So, having returned to the ship, the fog lifted, and the path before you now clear, the rest of the open, cloudless sky before you, you continued ahead in the southwestern direction towards the Islands of Anamn, which is where Vesrah exists--
Laura: But I wanted to see the prisoner--
Marisha: Yeah, the prisoner.
Laura: -- are they okay? I mean, did I check them out while I was--
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: We're getting to that right now.
Marisha: Let's bring 'em back.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Fuckin', just cool your jets.
Marisha: We wanna talk to him.
Laura: Well, I mean, I had him on my lap as I was flying back. I wanted to make sure they were okay.
Matt: Right, so you come back to the-- as you bring the prisoner down, you lay him down-- and it is a man, early, mid- thirties-ish, maybe looks grizzled, kind of a half beard growing in--
Travis: Kill him.
Matt: -- he is drowned at the moment.
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: Oh, he's dead?
Matt: He's not breathing, he is waterlogged, and even at a quick glance, you can see he has scars all over his body--
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: -- his clothes are tattered--
Marisha: Do I have any residual Control Water left? Yeah?
Matt: I'd say yeah, you're still concentrating--
Laura: I roll him on his side.
Marisha: Can I see if I can pull any water out of his lungs?
Matt: You know what? Make a wisdom check.
Liam: Out come the lungs.
Laura: (vomit noise) And he's dead. Dead dead.
Marisha: That's good! Just straight wisdom?
Liam: He's inside out.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Straight wisdom?
Travis: What is dead may never die!
Marisha: 21.
Laura: Oh no, you keep scooching back.
Matt: 21!
Marisha: Just straight wisdom?
Liam: What the heck, Laura.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So you get down on the low, and you reach out and grab the shoulder, and using the last moments of your Control Water spell, you focus and begin to just siphon the water out of the lungs, and immediately the body kind of convulses, the throat opens up from the outside, and you can see the water just project outward as the chest pushes inward, expelling the rest of the liquid from the lungs. Immediately, (coughs).
Marisha: Vax. Help.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.
Liam: I do pat, pat, pat, except I cast Lay on Hands when I do it.
Laura: Yeah, well, I cast Cure Wounds while that happens, so go fuck yourself.
Liam: Seems oddly competitive at this moment, where we're saving a man's life, but all right.
Matt: What last murmurs of this man's life that remained as he began to fade to the drowning, you both manage to just bring him back from the cusp of death, and coughing profusely over the next 30 or so seconds, turning onto his stomach and gathering himself, taking breaths, spitting out whatever seawater still remains in his lungs, he looks back up at you all, and you can see he has a ragged, mouse-brown hair on top, and it's shorter on the sides around the ear, rather large ears, kind of square jaw but very scrawny, and once again from the tattered clothes and scars all over his body, some fresh, some old, looks like he's undergone a rough recent weeks--
Laura: I feel like we're finding Percy all over again.
Marisha: No shit.
Matt: Kinda looks up at everyone. "Wh-- Where am I?"
Laura: On a boat!
Taliesin: Different boat. Ship.
Liam: Our boat.
Matt: "What do you want?"
Laura: How long have you been in that cell?
Matt: "Who are you?"
Marisha: Sorry.
Laura: We're your saviors.
Matt: He leans back, falls onto his palms a bit, and is just kinda laying back, too exhausted to move away, but trying to just move back a bit.
Laura: Can I insight check him and make sure? I just don't trust anyone.
Matt: Sure. Insight check.
Laura: Ooh, natural 20. Wow wow wow.
Sam: He's a demon.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Liam: It's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis!
Laura: Oh it is, it's Hotis, it's Hotis!
Marisha: Oh, I don't wanna fight Hotis on the ocean.
Sam: Guys, feel free to keep--
Marisha: What you got? What do you got, Grog?
Matt: Shove off, Travis.
Sam: Keep tweeting those pick-up lines to @TorBooks. They like 'em. I do, anyway.
Liam: Guys, I'm gonna make a Tor Books run, does anybody want anything?
Matt: Curse you, Travis.
Sam: Grande fantasy novel?
Laura: Don't worry.
Matt: (coughs)
Laura: Your captors have been defeated.
Matt: "Well that's good, eh?"
Laura: You're safe. What's your name?
Matt: He leans forward, sits up and looks at you. He seems to soften a little bit, though he's still guarded. "Thenton Groose. First Mate of the ship Tempest Fang. Yeah."
Laura: Tempest Fang?
Matt: "Tempest Fang. Yeah. It was taken by a bunch of bastards, kept me in that cage for a few weeks."
Laura: Weeks.
Marisha: Tempest Fang-- where do you hail from?
Matt: "Who wants to know?"
Marisha: Keyleth, of the Air Ashari.
Matt: "From around."
Marisha: From around?
Matt: "I'm a businessman of the seas."
Marisha: Not the sailor type, then?
Matt: "Sail a bit."
Marisha: What were you doing on the Ozmit Sea?
Matt: "Making a shipment across to Emon from Issylra, and this group of thugs decided to go ahead and ransack us from the side. Took our ship down and most of the crew. Kept a few of us alive underneath. Seems like I was the one who lasted the longest."
Marisha: From Emon to where?
Liam: From Issylra to Emon.
Matt: "From Issylra."
Marisha: Oh, from Issylra.
Liam: What was your cargo?
Matt: He looks at you for a second, reads you up and down as you step into the conversation. "General goods. Few fancy textiles--"
Liam: Insight check.
Matt: "Some silks, some furs."
Taliesin: Insight.
Matt: Insight check.
Liam: 18.
Taliesin: 19.
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Oh boy!
Laura: Again, again!
Sam: Lots of whispers, guys.
Liam: Just come sit with us.
Marisha: All the whispers.
Laura: Oh, but do you just wanna hang out over here? 'Cause Travis is just gonna fuck with your shit again.
Sam: Hey, in the future-- Travis, what do you think about this-- don't shake your butt.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: That's disgusting.
Marisha: Get it, Levi's, yeah.
Sam: What if we-- here's my pitch. What if we have two tin cans and a string that just goes to Matt, and we can do like one of these things.
Matt: That's a great idea.
Sam: Ah! Ah!
Laura: That would be so cool.
Matt: "Yeah, I'm just-- I'm glad you came along."
Taliesin: Tell me, friend. Why did they keep you alive?
Matt: "That's a good question."
Taliesin: It is.
Matt: "I don't fucking know."
Taliesin: What did they ask you?
Laura: Can we get some food?
Taliesin: I think that's a great idea.
Matt: Immediately his eyes widen--
Laura: I was talking back to Captain Adella or one of the crewmates. Not you, Grog.
Matt: As soon as you do that, Captain Adella goes, "Ah, I don't get food. You get food!" And one of the other crewmates, "Oh, oh right." And he immediately jumps down below the deck.
Sam: I'm gluten-free!
Liam: Well, we saved your life, how else can we help you, friend?
Matt: "Oh, just drop me off at the nearest port you get to, please."
Taliesin: That's going to be a while.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "That's fine. That's fine."
Marisha: Have you sailed frequently before? What was your exact duty on this ship?
Laura: First Mate?
Marisha: Oh. Right. He already said that. So, you sail a lot.
Matt: "A fair bit, yeah."
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Any tattoos on him?
Matt: Yeah, actually, a handful visibly.
Taliesin: Any I'd recognize? I was on a boat for quite a while, as well.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: It was a long time ago.
Matt: Make a history check.
Taliesin: All right. Let's say 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. None of the symbols you recognize, necessarily, however, the arrangement of them-- the placement of them and the general design are not used as-- there's tattoos you could see they're decoration, there're tattoos you could see that are meant as-- they mean something to the person. These tattoos and their placement seems intentionally to intimidate.
Taliesin: Huh. Okay.
Laura: Was he a pirate?
Travis: Mr. Theton Groove, is anyone looking for you right now?
Matt: "I don't think so, my crew went down with the ship."
Taliesin: What was your captain's name?
Matt: He kind of looks over at you, "Wha-- what-- why--"
Taliesin: I was just curious how quickly you'd answer it. It's fine. Carry on. You will be getting food, don't worry, this is not us being threatening, we're just... it's odd finding a man in a cage in the bottom of a terrible ship filled with awful people. That alone makes us like you, but you are a bit weird.
Marisha: That's true. That's all true.
Taliesin: It is true.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Forgive us, we have to be a bit wary.
Marisha: We've seen a lot.
Matt: "No, no, that's--"
Taliesin: We don't mind if you're disreputable, we just would like to know if you're our kind of disreputable.
Sam: If I may, new companions.
Travis: Oh god.
Sam: When my father would have--
Taliesin: Oh boy, okay.
Sam: -- sort of a cagey individual that he needed to interrogate, he had an employee named The Dog who was a large man, who would come and just squeeze them until they talked. Why don't we just do that here? It seems like it would be much quicker than talking in circles like this.
Marisha: Do you have The Dog with you?
Sam: Well, we have this guy, who's pretty big--
Marisha: Oh.
Sam: -- and I bet he could squeeze--
Travis: I mean, I second that method, but I'm just seeing if anybody else--
Taliesin: I feel like that's deeply premature.
Travis: It's deeply immature. I would never do something like that.
Taliesin: Immature indeed.
Sam: Well, all right.
Laura: Plus he's so frail right now, I'm afraid Grog would just break him in half.
Travis: Probably.
Matt: He is noticeably looking nervously back and forth between Taryon and Grog, and--
Travis: I mean, after all, we saved your life, right? You wouldn't be (yells) hiding nothing, would you?
Matt: "No?"
Travis: See?
Marisha: Honestly, this is how we treat people we like.
Taliesin: God, that's also true.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Does anyone have any water?"
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Matt: "Fresh water? Oh, thank you." And he pulls it out and just starts drinking thirstily from it.
Marisha: All right. So we've cleared a few things, right? You seem untrustworthy, and broken, so therefore we like you. What else can we learn about you?
Matt: "I don't know what you're talking about. Look, I have business contacts, I can get you paid, just get me safe somewhere."
Taliesin: What sort of business contacts?
Matt: "The sort that I do business with, I told you. We deal in trade across the Ozmit."
Liam: Yeah, I mean, he's shifty as fuck, but it's no skin off my back, right?
Taliesin: No, not really.
Travis: We got any cages on this boat?
Taliesin: Oh, we're not-- we don't need that yet, where's he going to go?
Laura: Do I see any, like, Clasp markings on him at all?
Liam: That question might be great, but I think we're all right.
Matt: Nothing Clasp. Not really.
Travis: Gotta sleep at some point.
Matt: You kinda glance over and look at the middle of his shoulders and his shirt is kind of billowing, and torn. No symbol of the Clasp.
Laura: Those scars on your body. Were they from before you were captured, or after?
Matt: "Some-- both ways. The cages don't really protect very well."
Laura: What were they doing to you?
Matt: "They were just having fun, trying to get information about my company, and, you know. Being general pirate arseholes."
Travis: Sounds fun.
Marisha: And you're sure they were just pirates, yeah?
Matt: "Well, what else are they? Not the most pious men I've ever met."
Marisha: I don't know. I've never met a real pirate until just now.
Matt: At which point, one of the crewmen comes up with a small cluster of biscuits, and hands them over as he greedily reaches out like, "Oh!"
Marisha: Wait, one of the crewmen?
Taliesin: One of ours.
Marisha: One of ours?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: I asked if they would bring him food.
Sam: We asked for food.
Matt: Adella just sent him for food.
Laura: I asked him to bring food.
Marisha: Why is he acting like he's starving?
Laura: Because he's been in a cage for two weeks. They didn't feed him very much.
Marisha: Oh, him, not our crewmate.
Travis: Holy shit.
Taliesin: Oh, okay, I--
Matt: The crewman brought food, and he reached out for it.
Marisha: Oh, sorry.
Matt: That's okay.
Marisha: Sorry, we were confused. Sorry.
Matt: That's okay.
Liam: Can't you see everything around you? It's all here.
Travis: He brings up a plate of biscuits and hungrily starts eating.
Taliesin: Bangarang. Bangarang!
Marisha: I brought you biscuits! (eating sounds)
Taliesin: Congratulations, Peter.
Matt: The crewman's a dick, by the way. Just--
Marisha: Do you want these?
Matt: These are good biscuits, starving guy! To be fair, that is kinda your style.
Laura: Thenton, you will forgive us if we don't give you free rein of the ship while you're on here.
Matt: "Oh no, that's fine. That's fine. I mean, lock me up, whatever you need. Just get me back to land, please."
Laura: We'll promise not to poke you.
Matt: "That's appreciated."
Marisha: So, you said you travel the Ozmit Sea frequently, yeah?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: Have you stumbled upon the island of the Vesrah? The Ashari people of this ocean?
Laura: (laughs) Of the Ashari.
Marisha: Of the Ashari (laughs).
Matt: He says, "If what you're referring to is the Islands of Anamn, we generally steer clear. Too many reefs."
Marisha: Of Omand? Alland?
Matt: Anamn. A-N-A-M-N.
Marisha: Almond?
Sam: Aman.
Taliesin: Joy.
Laura: A--
Marisha: Almond Joy.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Marisha: The Island--
Matt: A-N-A-M-N. Anamn.
Marisha: A-N-A-M-N.
Taliesin: Cluster.
Marisha: Anman. An-amn.
Travis: Well, we should introduce ourselves, at least.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: We are Vox Machina, a travelling group of acrobats, and--
Laura: Defeaters of dragons. No big deal.
Travis: Yep.
Liam: I do Van Damme splits, just as he finishes that sentence.
Laura: Trinket gets up and starts dancing around like he knows what to do, when we say we're performers.
Marisha: And I light up my fire hands.
Travis: We do have two smarter members that are not here, Scanlan and Pike, but maybe you'll see them later if you stick with us long enough.
Laura: She's a sailor, too.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: "Great."
Sam: Percival, am I misreading the scenario here? Can I please just pour acid on him until he talks to us? It seems like he's holding back, am I misreading, here?
Taliesin: No-- well, sort of-- not really-- sort of. It's complicated. We don't pour acid on people-- well, that's not true. No, that's a lie. We don't just pour acid on people, I feel like that's reasonable to say. We don't just pour acid--
Liam: Context. Context is key.
Taliesin: -- there's usually context involved. Things are complicated.
Sam: I am following your lead. But--
Taliesin: When it is time to pour the acid, we will undoubtedly make sure that you are on the front-- not yet--
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: -- but you're good.
Sam: All right.
Liam: Hey, Captain.
Matt: Adella's behind you guys--
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: -- just kinda watching this whole thing with her arms crossed. One of her crewmates is currently at the helm.
Liam: I mean, the closest place to us right now is our desination, most likely, right? We're not gonna be able to dump this guy before we arrive, do you think?
Matt: "Yeah, no, we got maybe a day and a half travel 'til we reach the islands, so--"
Liam: Oy.
Laura: That's all right, he can stay on the boat.
Travis: We got an extra room for him?
Matt: "We got a-- we can throw him in the brig."
Taliesin: We can make the brig comfortable.
Laura: Yeah. We'll give him food. It's all right, right, Captain?
Matt: "We'll set some of-- one of our men on guard. All right! Pick him up. Throw him in the hole." Two of the crewmen come behind and pick him up, and kind of lean over the shoulder, like, "Ooh, thank you. Thank you very much, all of you." And he gets dragged off down below into the ship.
Liam: Byeee.
Marisha: Bye.
Laura: Captain, have you heard of the Tempest Fang?
Matt: "I've heard a thing or two."
Laura: Oh, really?
Matt: "Yeah."
Taliesin: Is it a pirating vessel?
Matt: "Yeah." (all laugh)
Matt: "I was gonna let him finish his whole diatribe before we had a conversation, but he's one of 18 working companies out of the archipelago, so--"
Travis: I believe it's arch-i-pelago.
Sam: Sea diarrhea!
Travis: Jot this down! (horn noises)
Liam: That was sudden!
Taliesin: And the tension is relieved.
Marisha: So, wait. If he works for one of 18 companies of the archipelago, that means the archipelago has pirates--
Laura: -- 17 other companies.
Marisha: 17 other pirate ships?
Matt: Pirate companies. It's a very-- some of them have alliances, some of them have very, very deep-rooted rivalries, and yeah.
Taliesin: The companies themselves have more than one ship, if I recall.
Matt: Some of them do, depending on the size.
Marisha: Wait, did we just sink one of the other 17 companies of the archipelago?
Travis: Is there any extensive damage to our ship? Are we still pretty good, other than the railing getting ripped off?
Matt: "Looking around, my crewmen tell me we're doing all right. So we'll do some repairs when we drop off at your location. Once you do your business, we'll have some time to go ahead and do a once-over of our ship."
Taliesin: I may have some charts that I stole from the other ship, as well.
Laura: Oh, yeah. I put them in the Bag of Colding for the time being. Pull it out.
Matt: Okay. Glancing about, a lot of them are maps of portions of the archipelago, the Hespit Archipelago, some are markings of various pirate headquarters, various places of parlay. A lot of them are waterlogged and soaked and damaged, but you can see elements that are-- a lot of them are hand-drawn notes in sections. The leather tube that you found, you pull it open, and there is a very, very immaculate piece of vellum paper that appears to have a number of glyphs scrawled across it.
Laura: Shit. Do we understand?
Sam: May I see that?
Taliesin: Sure.
Sam: I will Identify it.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: What? (all cheer)
Sam: Much easier this way.
Laura: That's great! You can Identify things? How many times a day can you do that?
Sam: I think all? Scroll of Programmed Illusion. Scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action to cast the sixth-level spell Programmed Illusion. If the spell is higher-level than the caster can use, they must make a spellcasting blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
Laura: Are you an arcane user?
Sam: I think I am.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Is this basically like the thing in Superman 2 where Lex Luthor's playing chess--
Travis: In the prison cell?
Matt: Kind of?
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: You have to look up the spell for the specifics, but yeah, it's got some interesting uses.
Sam: Are you arcane?
Laura: So basically it's you. You can use it.
Sam: Am I the only arcane?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yes, I'm a natural caster. You're the only arcane caster.
Laura: I mean, hold on to it in case we run into Scanlan again.
Travis: I am a powerful magician.
Laura: Or you can use it.
Travis: And with that, I take out the little gem thing that I pulled off the other ship.
Sam: Ooh! Should I Identify that?
Taliesin: You should Identify it.
Marisha: You should.
Sam: Can I, more than once a day?
Matt: Look at the ability. It's the spell-- I gotta look.
Sam: It's the Identify spell.
Matt: Yeah, it's a first-level spell.
Marisha: All the papers. All the papers in the world.
Taliesin: I imagine you're sitting here going--
Matt: It's a first-level spell, so as long as you have a first-level spell slot.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: Oh, I have a spyglass, I didn't even need to ask for Captain Adella's.
Sam: It's a ritual, though, is that--
Matt: Oh, yeah, if you can use it as a ritual, then it won't use a spell slot when you do that.
Marisha: You just do it, it just takes time.
Sam: All right. I will ritually Identify that. What's that all about?
Matt: That is a fog marker. It can be used by holding it a round, but it is generally used to create a 100-foot-wide fog cloud that lasts for an hour when used.
Sam: Do we know how to activate it?
Matt: To activate it, you have to spend a ten-minute period of time concentrating on the orb, and then as it gets moved, it carries the fog cloud with it and lasts for an hour.
Laura: That's cool.
Sam: Could be useful.
Laura: Super useful.
Taliesin: At the very least, it could be installed in the ship. They could have it as a possible--
Sam: Cloaking device?
Travis: You could put it in the guts of Dottie.
Sam: Doty.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Deedee?
Marisha: Could you do that?
Taliesin: I don't know. It's not like he's hollow.
Marisha: In Doodie?
Sam: I mean, he's got a lot of stuff in there.
Travis: But that's not important, that stuff in there.
Liam: What kind of stuff?
Taliesin: Things.
Sam: You know.
Liam: No.
Sam: When you have two wheels and some ropes and it makes a pulley system--
Travis: Okay, no, just give it back to me, I'll put it back in the Bag of Holding.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Thanks.
Taliesin: How big is the orb, out of curiosity?
Matt: The orb is maybe seven-inch diameter. It's about that big.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: It's seven-inch--
Matt: Yeah, it's about that big.
Taliesin: Interesting. All right.
Matt: So the ship is still progressing in that direction.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check on it? On the orb?
Matt: To? What do you want to do with the nature check?
Sam: To see if it smells like nature.
Marisha: Did it come from any Water Ashari, or anything like that? (all laugh)
Travis: What?
Matt: Roll a nature check.
Sam: Are you my brother? Are you my brother? (all laugh)
Marisha: 14?
Matt: It looks like a magic item.
Marisha: That's awesome. That's cool.
Taliesin: Does it have smoke inside when you turn it?
Matt: Yeah, when you turn it--
Taliesin: Like those weird balls filled with weird sand--
Matt: Yeah, actually, it kinda looks like that. As you shift it, it swirls on the inside. It causes the air-- intense condensation that eventually drips from the outside of it when it's activated.
Laura: Cool.
Marisha: (laughs) Outlook cloudy.
Matt: All right. So as everything rests down in the ship you can use, you have about a day and a half travel until you're supposed to reach the islands.
Travis: Can I post up outside of the brig where stabbed-in-the-body McGee is sleeping?
Matt: Yeah. And as he--
Travis: I'll forego my room. I just want to sleep sitting up.
Liam: Do we have rooms? I thought it was like Amex City on this--
Laura: No, we have rooms. But they're combined.
Matt: Yeah, they're clustered, you have many people per room. They're like bunks. So yeah, you post outside of the brig. As evening comes, the night passes. Is there anything you want to do? You just rest for the night?
Travis: Yeah, just keep the other guard company.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Just to give him a little expert help.
Taliesin: We've been tinkering on the ship, so.
Matt: What have you been tinkering?
Sam: Science-bro stuff.
Taliesin: Science-bro stuff. Do we have to tell you what it is?
Matt: To tinker it, so I can give you a DC, yeah.
Taliesin: So he's got this really cool--
Matt: "We tinkered something really cool. Did it work?" Sure, it succeeds. "We built Voltron."
Taliesin: You were very cagey about knowing what it is while we were on break, so I didn't know if this was a thing.
Sam: So, using one of the opals from my Helm of whatever, Brilliance, he wanted to craft a housing for it--
Taliesin: So I've built a couple housings for these opals. So, you pop the opal in, and it will allow it to create either a concentrated beam--
Sam: Spotlight.
Taliesin: Spotlight, basically, like a little flashlight, a radiant beam like a torch--
Marisha: Floodlight.
Taliesin: Like a floodlight, or while it's on spotlight, it's got a little railroad thing, it's got a little slot that will go in and give me a little bit of a red vibe, so we can have a low-light red light, and I'm also going to make a little clip so I can stick it on my gun, so I can have a little spotlight on my gun when we're going through a--
Liam: It also ensures you cannot get a prom date.
Taliesin: Hey, I'm doing okay, just saying. Percy doing okay.
Laura: I don't know, you've been tinkering a lot lately.
Matt: Okay, so that's doable. The opal doesn't perpetually glow--
Sam: Yeah, it lasts for an hour. Is that something we can turn off and on and it lasts for an hour, like a battery, or is it just an hour, it's off--
Taliesin: And then we have to pop a new opal in.
Matt: Generally, you have to pop a new opal in.
Sam: Okay, no problem.
Taliesin: But you crack the opal, you put it in, it's like one hour of either flashlight, and then a little blinder to turn it on and off-- it's basically like a little train lantern.
Marisha: I was gonna say, like an old-school lighthouse.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a tinker check.
Taliesin: Doing this together?
Sam: Can I help him?
Matt: Yes, you would be giving him advantage as you attempt to do that. So you just roll it twice, Percy.
Taliesin: That was pretty good.
Sam: Did we get two 16s?
Taliesin: I got a 19.
Sam: Oh. I got a 16, but I get plus ten with my tinkerer's tools.
Taliesin: And mine's proficiency bonus and dex bonus on top of that 19? So that's 30.
Matt: Between the two of you guys, it is not an issue. Even with your limited materials, but your travel-tinkering capabilities-- you manage to deftly create this seamless, beautiful, you could sell it on the street.
Taliesin: So they can-- we may even make a little headband so they can pop it on.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Matt: (laughs) You guys are so cute. All right.
Marisha: I spend my evening reconnecting with Vax.
Matt: Okay. (all laugh)
Sam: The Hallmark card way of saying fucking.
Taliesin: Well, there goes our sponsor by Hallmark.
Matt: Yeah, thanks. Sorry, Hallmark.
Liam: It's a couple days-- we've been traveling for a while, right?
Matt: It was three days before this encounter, you have a day and a half left.
Liam: And has a day passed since that fight?
Laura: No.
Liam: No, this is that night?
Laura: This is that night, yeah.
Matt: This is the evening afterward.
Taliesin: I'll see if I get my charges back.
Marisha: I don't want to say I feel like I'm being replaced. You know? It's not that. It's just that Percy's kinda found a new friend.
Liam: You're losing some friends.
Taliesin: We're not hanging out all the time, we're being social.
Marisha: No, it's not that. I'm a good friend, right?
Liam: Oh hi, Percy.
Sam: I was going to say we're being social.
Taliesin: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You guys aren't there. I got distracted.
Matt: No, you guys are busy tinkering. You two are having a conversation where Vax is trying to console Keyleth's sudden friendship crisis.
Sam: Oh! Oh! You've got a little smudge right there.
Marisha: I mean, I know I can't--
Liam: You're missing your friendo time, I understand. (all laugh)
Marisha: I can't fulfill every need.
Liam: We hear them laughing from their room. (all laugh)
Taliesin: (snorts)
Matt: It is a very thin wall.
Travis: Yes, snorting.
Sam: And it was the metric system!
Sam: (exaggerated laugh) (all laugh)
Taliesin: (exaggerated laugh) (all laugh)
Marisha: I will never know what the metric system means. I don't know what that is.
Liam: They're both, you know, really special and--
Marisha: I'm still a good friend, right? I'm still a good friend?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Am I a good friend?
Liam: Yeah. You're his best friend.
Marisha: All right.
Liam: Yeah, that's just new--
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: -- and those two have never met--
Marisha: No, I know.
Liam: -- a nerd as pure as the other.
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: I know I told them to like, bond but now-- I mean (sighs). No, it's fine, it's fine. I'm cool. I'm cool.
Liam: You're more than cool.
Marisha: I've missed you.
Liam: (chuckles) Hi.
Marisha: Hi. (crying sounds) (all laugh)
Liam: I dry the tears away. Do you know--
Marisha: (tearfully) New guy and the new guy dynamic! And I don't know what the new guy's chemistry's like!
Liam: Do you know what's really cool, though? We're not on the verge of death every fucking day right now.
Marisha: (tearfully) That's true.
Liam: Yeah, you know, pluses and minuses.
Marisha: (tearfully) I'm glad the new guy's the worst of our problems. (all laugh)
Liam: Come here, you.
Marisha: (tearfully) I just love Percy so much.
Liam: I know, I know.
Matt: Aw.
Liam: I know.
Matt: An evening of consoling and the rest of you guys get your evening's rest, you outside the brig, uneventful.
Laura: I did want to talk, but that's okay.
Taliesin: I get that.
Laura: I can talk later.
Matt: Oh, did you want to talk? Go for it. Go for it.
Travis: (burps)
Liam: Go interrupt the party.
Laura: Yeah no, I was going to. TALIESIN; Well, I was going to say, you're welcome. We're finishing up, you're welcome in.
Marisha: (sobs)
Laura: Oh! Only when you're finishing up.
Travis: Ooh.
Taliesin: Well, I don't know when you were-- We obviously did it.
Sam: We built our--
Taliesin: I love that so much, it's so--
Travis: Wow, wow.
Liam: Did it?
Taliesin: Yeah, we put the whole thing together.
Liam: Put the whole thing?
Taliesin: The whole thing put together.
Matt: Phrasing.
Liam: Sure, yeah.
Marisha: Man, you're going for it. (all laugh)
Matt: You hear, as you guys are finishing up, you hear a knock at the door.
Travis: Cleaning up your--
Laura: Hello?
Taliesin: Yes! Come in.
Laura: Is it filled with smoke in here?
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: Oh, hi Tary. I didn't see you.
Sam: We were welding.
Laura: Fun! Exciting! On a boat, even. Wow.
Taliesin: It's relatively safe.
Laura: So! What'd you make?
Taliesin: (sighs) Can I crack one?
Sam: Let's do it.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: Oh wait, we're using one?
Taliesin: We're using one.
Sam: All right, sure. Why not? It's 1000 gold, but okay, sure. (all laugh)
Taliesin: It's his father's money.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: (crack, dink) As he flicks the opal, it gives off a bright equivalent of the Light spell.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Daylight.
Matt: Daylight! I'm sorry. This is--
Laura: Oh, shit.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: The power of the sun.
Laura: That's powerful.
Matt: Basically, there's a sun in the room suddenly (crackle).
Taliesin: Wait.
Laura: Oh wow, you guys made a--
Matt: You're literally blinded for a moment.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: Your eyes just go (crackle).
Taliesin: We put it in the box, contain it.
Sam: Well, wait, open it just a little bit.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: And then I'm gonna take my Helm of Brilliance and just put one of the diamonds up to the laser beam like light coming out so it makes like a dazzling light across the--
Laura: Wow.
Matt: It's a beautiful prism, which you're able to see in about 40 seconds. (all laugh)
Laura: It's a lot, it's just a lot of spots right now, but I'm sure.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Laura: Eventually. Oh! Pretty. Um, get out. You, not you. If you don't mind.
Sam: I don't at all.
Laura: I mean, of course you can stay--
Taliesin: Get out. It's okay.
Sam: I have a lot of dictation to do.
Taliesin: Out, out, out, out, out.
Laura: (quietly) Hi.
Taliesin: And I boot him out. Oh hi, thank god. And--
Laura: So, Percy.
Taliesin: Yes, dear?
Laura: I've been meaning to bring something up to you.
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: At the risk of bringing up Scanlan again--
Taliesin: Oh.
Laura: Something I'd rather ignore.
Taliesin: Yes, me too.
Laura: When he left, he said something that caught my ear, which was that he heard. He heard Pike and his daughter, calling to him.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: From the other side. Which is strange really, because when I was on the other side, I don't remember hearing anything. What about you?
Taliesin: Okay. I'm gonna sit down and open up a bottle.
Laura: Busting out the Courage again?
Taliesin: The Courage, I think, is long gone at this point.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going for the Tear whiskey, fuck it Take a swing, and I pass.
Laura: Mm.
Taliesin: I was not in a good place, I was-- what I am choosing to describe as great motivation to live a long life. There was pain and sound and I've tried hard not to think about creating words to articulate it, but it was the feeling of being-- it was not pain without end, it felt like pain that would have an end because eventually there would be nothing left of me. I felt consumed. And yes, I heard. It was the only thing I heard. Yes. I know you well enough to know-- trying not to embarrass you, but--
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: -- yes.
Laura: I'm not embarrassed.
Taliesin: Well, I would've, honestly-- I would've never hoped otherwise. You're far too wonderful for an idiot.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: So (sighs), but I'm more hopeful. I'm not quite as fearful of whether-- I'm worrying less about what may happen when I die again and if I'm going to go back there.
Laura: Well, that's good. I would hope he's not waiting on the other side for you.
Taliesin: I hope not either, and--
Laura: What about when you were killed by Raishan?
Taliesin: That was quick. It was fine, but it was quick, so I'm not sure if that means anything yet. I've overthought this quite a bit and I don't know if you care to hear too many of my fears in this direction, but, I do think about it.
Laura: You can always tell me your fears, Percy.
Taliesin: Where do the people I kill go? I know you don't have an answer, I don't have an answer either, but--
Laura: I don't, I suppose it depends on them, doesn't it?
Taliesin: Does it? Or does it depend on me? Or does it now depend on this thing?
Laura: You don't think they were doomed to suffer the same fate that you were?
Taliesin: Maybe. I don't know, maybe I keep feeding it every time--
Laura: Oh no.
Taliesin: I don't quite know how to find out, other than I had a moment where I thought about shooting someone, bringing them back and asking them.
Laura: (gasps)
Taliesin: There was a moment I thought about shooting someone. Well, if it comes to it, it's something I've had in my back pocket as killing two birds with one stone.
Laura: Maybe we can just try that on someone who we already need to kill.
Taliesin: That's my thought.
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: And, I worry about what all of this is doing to us, but at the same time, I have such faith in-- I have such faith in you and Keyleth, and occasionally Grog, and occasionally your brother.
Laura: (laughs) Are you listening?
Taliesin: (laughs) But I'm starting to wonder if this is what all those heroes I read about when I was young, if this is what they felt, is just a lot of getting very comfortable with not knowing and being nervous and wondering if you're really just the villain of someone else's story.
Laura: I'm sure that's how they feel. No one's ever sure they're doing the right thing.
Taliesin: But I did hear you, sorry to-- I did hear you and sorry that I didn't say.
Laura: No, it's all right. Takes the pressure off, really, knowing that you know.
Taliesin: I treasure every minute, and you remind me to not be so serious.
Laura: Yes. So serious.
Taliesin: I'm not saying that you're not serious but-- (sighs)
Laura: (exasperated voice) You can go play with Tary some more if you like.
Taliesin: I'm done with Tary for the evening.
Laura: Great! Then you can play with me! (all laugh)
Taliesin: And crossing the whiskey off the inventory.
Matt: Off the-- yeah.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: All right, as the evening--
Travis: Amazing.
Matt: -- the evening comes to a close, the next day's journey is met with a coming cloudfront, does not appear to be storm-bearing clouds but the clear skies seem to have come to an end.
Marisha: I'm restless in all of my night's sleep as we get closer.
Matt: Mm-hm. As the next day comes to a close, the sun setting, you hear a call from the top of the crow's nest that shouts out, "Land ho!"
Laura: We go running up.
Matt: You guys all catch up and you can see--
Liam: (quietly) You got this.
Marisha: (groans)
Matt: -- just as the last bit of sunlit glow behind the clouds begins to fade into darkness, you see ahead the gentle shape of islands just breaking the horizon ahead, and one by one, little lights (click click click) coming on.
Marisha: I rush to the bow of the ship.
Matt: As you come up to the bow of the ship, you can see at this point now, Captain Adella is starting to shout off to the side, "Keep it all high!" and is currently moving around and you see there are three guys at the front who all have lanterns out and they're watching the water below and they're shouting out, "Five to the right!" and they're giving different degrees and she's navigating through what looks to be a channel of reefs, as you glance over the edge. And you can see there are pathways here, but it looks like a lot of this water is very dangerous water and eventually you get to a point where one of them shouts, "Stop! Stop!" and they immediately throw down the sails and someone throws the anchor off the side and the ship (crunching) comes and slams to a halt as the anchor clicks and you can feel it grinding for a bit as it catches the edge of one of-- it looks like a reef below, but the ship eventually stops as you glance over, there maybe 15 feet away from hitting the edge of a reef. (grinding sound) It stops and the water (whistling) slowly comes to rest as the ship comes to a rest. Looking over the edge, you can see the water maybe about 20 or so feet down with what little bit of light the lanterns have put over, you can see the very top of various reef cliffs and hints of beach shelf beginning to rise up towards this cluster of almost like still fairy lights in the distance, unmoving. Captain Adella comes up to the edge of the ship and goes, "Well, that's about as far as we can get with this ship. My apologies."
Marisha: No, this is fantastic. And I run to the edge of the ship and I shoot a Daylight into the spell and throw a Create Water and make a rainbow over top of us.
Matt: Wow.
Marisha: (tch boom) Ooh.
Matt: So with that (pffff) the spray of vapor in the air of the night sky, the darkness ahead of you that was currently-- the clouds obscuring any sort of starlight, suddenly is showered with a spray of vibrant colors across the entire spectrum, as the vapor slowly cascades around each side of the ship. As it does, a few moments pass and you watch more lights spark open in the distance (puff puff puff puff puff) whatever the source is, you begin to get a clearer view and there you can just barely begin to see the edges of what appear to be a very, very faint outline of a number of buildings all springing up from the water itself.
Travis: (quietly) Oh shit.
Matt: The city is not on one of the islands, the city is in the center of them, there's a triangulation of these land masses and the city itself resides between all three.
Sam: (quietly) Wow.
Matt: Some of the guys in the front of the ship start taking small rowing boats and taking them up and latching them in and setting them off the side into the more shallow waters below.
Marisha: I run past all of them and just jump into the water, not gracefully like before and start swimming.
Matt: Make a perception check. (all groan)
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: Perception check?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: We're at a reef!
Liam: Don't face-plant on a reef!
Marisha: Fine. Ooh!
Taliesin: There is now!
Liam: I'm on a reef.
Marisha: Oh that's just a dexterity check?
Matt: No, perception.
Sam: Perception.
Marisha: Oh, perception. 28.
Matt: You run to the edge and right as you're about to leap, you look and realize there's relatively shallow reef in the direction you're about to leap, so you kinda turn and (laughs) go at an angle instead and (plop) into the water below.
Marisha: (nervous sounds)
Matt: A second, almost a second after you, the ship (cracks) hits the water below and they start throwing down the rope ladder and you guys are allowed to then step into the rowboat.
Laura: Broom.
Taliesin: Carpet?
Matt: You have the broom. Or carpet if you like?
Marisha: I just start--
Taliesin: I'm gonna get on the carpet and offer it to anybody who likes.
Marisha: Using my cantrips--
Travis: Well, I need the boat 'cause I'm heavy.
Taliesin: What about the boat?
Sam: I want to be on the flying carpet, 'cause that's amazing.
Laura: Trinket will get in a boat with Grog.
Liam: What are you doing?
Laura: No! Trinket's gonna be in my necklace.
Matt: All right. Trinket goes in the necklace.
Laura: Yeah, for a minute.
Liam: Hopping on behind my sister.
Matt: Okay, so your sister, you guys are taking the carpet--
Sam: Yes!
Matt: -- Grog, you're going in the boat?
Travis: I got my own rowboat.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: With a robot. Robot in the--
Sam: Oh yeah! The robot is--
Travis: No. Dottie is not coming with me.
Taliesin: Dottie is coming with you.
Sam: Well, he can come on the--
Laura: No, he can't. It's too heavy. It's too heavy for the carpet.
Taliesin: Doty cannot come on the carpet.
Matt: It's too heavy to go on the carpet.
Sam: I have to stay behind with Doty.
Taliesin: Yeah well, have fun.
Travis: Yep, see you later.
Laura: Get him on a boat. Get on a boat, Tary.
Sam: Is there another rowboat for us?
Matt: They have other rowboats on the side, you can request another one.
Sam: I would like to request another rowboat for Doty.
Marisha: (laughing) A boat for Doty.
Matt: Okay, so as you guys begin making your way, roughly five minutes behind you, as you all are kinda moving forward together via carpet, flight, and her swimming, and Grog strongly pushing his way through, Tary's just impatiently waiting for them to get the other boat off the side of the ship and they're slowly lowering it down, kind of the ropes having to adjust as it goes and you're like (groans). (all laugh)
Travis: I see adventure over this way! Too bad you won't be there to see it!
Sam: I'm missing it, hurry up! (all laugh)
Matt: As you guys begin to approach, Keyleth, your feet eventually hit sand as opposed to treading water, and as you begin to walk up, the water comes past your waist, down to eventually your knees, and that is about as low as it goes.
Marisha: As far as it goes, yeah.
Matt: And looking out above you, you can see this beautiful lagoon that is completely submerged in about a foot, foot and a half of water for a good mile in all directions. And you can see dozens and dozens of these Grecian looking white and green marble structures that rise up out of the water. You can see a series of poles that stand up holding these lanterns that have all been magically set alight to give the city a sort of a glow. You see shapes moving, you see figures shifting out of these buildings and making their way in your direction, and as you're looking at this space in front of you and you guys begin to kind of meet up, you watch as a figure (whoosh) out of the water next to Keyleth. You glance to your left and look down and you see what appears to be a child, maybe about 13 years old, human-like, though his ears come to a bit of a finned appearance. You can see what looks to be gill slits to the side of the neck, and he looks up at you with kind of a tattered, long-stiffened piece of cloth tunic and shorts that end at the knee,and he kinda looks up at you and just kinda smiles with these very, very bright, orange-ish yellow eyes, "Hi."
Marisha: Kaitiaki. And I drop to my knees and drop down and--
Matt: (sploosh) You go face-down into the water.
Marisha: Gah! (heavy breathing)
Matt: Get up and (groans) push the water-- the hair back a bit.
Marisha: And bow again.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: Okay. "Um... what are you doing?"
Marisha: Sorry, are you the leader-- are you the headmaster?
Matt: "Yes. Yes, I am."
Marisha: Oh! Hi. Uh, Keyleth.
Matt: "Keyleth. " And he reaches out and grabs your hand. "Yulan."
Marisha: Yulan!
Matt: "Leader of the Water Ashari."
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente. And I bow again, under the water.
Matt: (splash) Into the water again.
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: He shakes his head, you can see now he has these tossed medium-length dreadlocks that shake with his head as he turns side to side, (laughs) He looks up at the rest of you, "So! She yours?"
Laura: Mm. Mm-hm.
Taliesin: More or less.
Matt: "You bad people?"
Laura: Uh-uh.
Taliesin: Nah.
Travis: Not today.
Sam: We're just rowing up. What'd I miss?! Start over, start over! (pants)
Matt: "Is he a bad person?"
Laura: Nah.
Liam: Nah. He's all right.
Taliesin: He's workable.
Matt: "Okay. Well, come with me." And he reaches out and taps you on the shoulder, Keyleth.
Marisha: (gasp) It's just such an honor.
Matt: Come on.
Laura: Keyleth!
Marisha: What?
Matt: He grabs your hand and pulls you up out of the water, and starts running in towards the city, holding you behind him. Just kinda tugging you by the hand.
Laura: Oh, he has legs?
Matt: He does have legs.
Laura: Man!
Taliesin: And he does know how to use them.
Travis: Keyleth!
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: Splash, splash, splash splash splash splash...
Travis: Be cooler.
Marisha: Cooler. Cooler. (blows) And I let a little frost go from my breath.
Matt: (blows) Okay. Splash, splash, splash splash splash splash splash. He's just running through the water. You can see a number of people have now stepped out of the buildings as you guys approach. And each one of them-- all of their clothing ends at the knee. You can see that this entire society walks through and lives partially submerged. There is an ever-present water element to their day to day life.
Laura: They must have the pruniest feet!
Marisha: -- feet.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: I know, right?
Liam: (laughs)
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: That was amazing. I would live there in a second!
Taliesin: How did that happen just now? How did you just go there?
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: The sand is soft and still strangely warm beneath your feet, though the night has come. And even through the distant sparkles of light everywhere, this city-- a lot of the buildings seem hollow and open, like what walls that there are, there's large windows. It seems like everything has this very kind of open-air, free lifestyle to it. And as you begin to approach--
Marisha: As he's dragging me, I just start, like, rambling all the questions at once. I'm like, Aren't-- This is such a gorgeous city you have. Are you freshwater or saltwater? Do you have webbed feet? Does everyone have webbed feet? How many people can control water? Wow, look at that. Look at those. Is this fire that you use? Or is it all arcane?
Matt: He's not answering any of your questions, and you hear a voice shout out: "Yulan!"
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: And the boy kinda stops and drops your hand and backs away with his hands kinda crossed behind his back, and he steps away, bowing his head a little bit and (splashing noise) away. The crowd-- and you can now see, all these different people, most of them appear to be human, elven, there are a handful of dwarves, a couple halflings, it's a spread of races here. You see two half-orcs that have these large tridents off to the side, and they're guarded but they're all deciding whether or not this is a welcoming circumstance, or a careful parlay. The voice that rang out, the crowd parts a little bit, and you watch as the water around you guys begins to spiral into these columns. Each one appears to be similar to the entity you saw rise onto the ship. A series of water elementals begin to rise out of the water, as some of the individuals in the crowd pull their hands together, and then you see four of them rise and begin to circle. Not closing in, but just keeping very close vigil around. And you realize at this point that, while the city is welcoming, they are also a carefully guarded people. The crowd parts, and you see stepping out, with the tiniest of splashes, a very tiny woman. Old, shriveled, most of her hair is gone and these thin wisps of white and gray, a wide oval-like head, the skin itself an olive yellow tint. Very wrinkled and pruny, the eyes are almost these tiny little black beads. Gnome, very old, with a long staff that's twice her height that just kinda with each step (squishing splash) kinda like a weird female Water Ashari Yoda. And just kinda steps forward through the water--
Marisha: Rad!
Matt: "Yulan, you are not to greet our guests! Now, you. What is your name?"
Marisha: Hi. (clears throat) Kaitiaki, I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente. I am--
Matt: "Kaitiaki."
Marisha: Kaitiaki. I am honored to be in your presence.
Matt: "I am Uvenda, Heart of the Tides here. I had my own Aramente, long ago. And I knew your mother who came for her Aramente, as well."
Marisha: You knew my mother?
Matt: "She came here for her own Aramente. And now you come to complete what she could not. So--"
Marisha: I'm-- I'm--
Matt: "-- you are welcome, Keyleth of the Zephra."
Marisha: I'm sorry. I'm-- sorry, that just means she visited the Earth, and the Fire, and the Water Ashari. She completed her Aramente.
Matt: "She did not, child."
Marisha: What hap-- She-- I-- Everywhere I've been, she's been. Why not?
Matt: "Come. Come. We shall speak, there is much to discuss, and it is growing cold out here, and you could probably all use a warm fire. So? See to our guests!" And the folks around go from their tense reverie and begin to approach and take, like just instinctually taking your belongings, and helping you unload. You guys (laughs) withdraw, and they back off as soon as they realize that wasn't part of the circumstance. But you are led deeper into this city, and there is a central temple that has multi-layers. Three floors with a number of spiral staircases on the outside of the structure that lead to it. Each floor is still very open and you get the sense that this whole city is built around the flow of ocean air and sea spray. And there is almost like a constant breeze that just blows through. And a lot of the buildings are rounded at the edges. The heavy waves and water that just come through here has-- you can see rounded and brought curvature to all the structures for as long as the city's been around. There are elements of shell-type shapes, there are bits of ocean inspiration to the architecture, it's a very interesting, alien, and beautiful place compared to where you've been before. You're led into this temple structure in the center of this city, you're brought to a series of what look almost like tree stumps, but they're made of a bright, bleached white, almost spongy material. And as you sit on them, food is brought to you, fish, fresh cooked platters. You guys are now being treated like honored guests, as you arrive. As you sit down, Keyleth, Uvenda, has a servant bring a much taller sponged stool than the ones you guys have, and it's set in front of you, and she uses her staff and (grunts) pole-vaults on top of it, and sits, crosses her legs, and sets the staff off to somebody and kinda leans down with her hands in front, her chin resting on them, her little beady gnomish eyes looking down at you. "So, Keyleth, the Aramente is not easy."
Marisha: I know.
Matt: "Do you know what this leg of your journey entails?"
Marisha: I mean, I've made it this far. In my heart, I feel like I'm almost complete, but I feel like you're about to tell me something different.
Matt: "You are near the completion of the Aramente, this is true, and through this, you will learn the strength of utilizing your own capabilities and those of your trusted allies. You will learn various ways of looking at the difficulties and challenges that are before you. And there are lessons as part of this, so listen carefully. For the final leg of your Aramente, we will wait 'til the morning sun comes to these waters, you and your compatriots will be brought down below the waves, below this city, to the Aerie of Torrent, where the Vesrah rift resides to the Water Elemental Plane. The Aerie is where we implant the lodestones that keep the village from sinking, and the rift size contained. The lodestones, unfortunately, do wane in power over time, so we must occasionally cross into the rift, and have our fastest Waverunners recover replacements within the Elemental Plane. The source of the lodestones, in which we have built and maintained this city. But the once-challenging path to these lodestones has now become deadly for all but our swiftest."
Marisha: Why?
Matt: "We would find these stones sparsely scattered throughout the plane, just beyond the rift, leaving us uncertain of their origin for as long as we've been here. For generations, they would just fall and sink to the bottom, or we'd scavenge them from the silt and sand below. However, this last generation of Waverunners have discovered them to be a product. Natural waste of a particular creature that resides within the boundless oceans of the plane. An ancient beast, once guided upon creation by the Titans that claimed this world their own before the gods came and gave light to our souls."
Marisha: What's it called?
Matt: "They are known in many languages, by many names, but the common tongue knows to them as the krakens."
Laura: (yells)
Marisha: (yells)
Sam: (scared panting)
Travis: (excited hyperventilation)
Matt: "Humongous, tentacled beasts, long free of their servitude from their creators. One of these such krakens has taken to the waters near the rift, and made it its home on the other side. And this beast appears to have been producing the lodestones that we relied on for ages. This research, and information they've gathered, however, garnished the attention of this terrible fiend, and was accidentally led directly to the rift where it now nests, and feeds on the other creatures naturally drawn to the energy of the tear between the worlds. We now use the lodestones and our powers not only to control the merging of the planes at the rift, but to also prevent this monstrosity from crossing over into our world and tearing our city asunder. Your task--"
Marisha: So--
Matt: She puts a finger out to stop you. "--would be to descend into this Aerie of Torrent, enter the rift, and recover three of these lodestones, and return to us. That is all. Avoid the beast if possible, for to battle it is folly, and to kill it is to sink our city, and curse the rift, to eventually fade."
Marisha: So, don't kill it?
Laura: Do. Not. Kill. Got it.
Marisha: Don't kill the kraken. Right? Don't kill the kraken?
Travis: No, kill the kraken.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Get kraken.
Sam: We can reason with it.
Marisha: Get three lodestones, bring it back, don't kill him because he is responsible for you guys not sinking into the ocean.
Laura: Because he makes the lodestones.
Sam: With his poop?
Liam: Poopstones.
Marisha: He makes the lodestones--
Laura: Basically.
Sam: Poops lodestones.
Marisha: -- with his droppings?
Matt: "Essentially, yes." (all laugh)
Marisha: All right.
Matt: "To use such base terms."
Marisha: All right. So he drops these lodestones at the base of the water plane.
Matt: "Yes. Often found within the vicinity of the rift, but such is the beast. Be quick, be careful, be stealthy, and return as soon as you have them."
Marisha: Do you have an example of these lodestones so that we know what we're looking for?
Matt: "We will show you at the Aerie tomorrow in the morning."
Marisha: All right. So this starts in the morn-- Which is exactly what you said. You totally said that, didn't you?
Matt: "Yes. Yes, I have."
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Is there something that helps those of us who don't breathe underwater breathe underwater?
Marisha: I can handle that.
Laura: Yes?
Marisha: I can handle that. So. What happened to my mother?
Matt: She swallows strongly. "Your mother was a brave woman, very much like you, now that I see you before me. Unsure of herself, and wishing to please, and not disappoint. And it's hard to ascertain but I fear it's perhaps that lack of confidence that may have caused her failure."
Marisha: Did she not make it out? Of the water plane?
Matt: "She brought her own companions, that she had found and brought with her along her path. Our guides brought her to the rift, and her companions did not survive. Your mother did not return, and we sent scouts to try and retrieve her body so she could be interred correctly, but we only found a leg."
Marisha: She's still alive. That means she's still alive.
Matt: "Hold onto that hope. Use it, and finish what she started. She lives through you at the very least. Hold that memory."
Marisha: I will hold on to it, but I hope you know that does not define me. I'm not her.
Matt: "Good. Then perhaps you have a chance."
Marisha: We'll complete your task. Thank you.
Matt: "You've come far, young Keyleth. I have faith that you will rise, and become the Voice of the Tempest. For now, we rest. Eat. Sleep. For tomorrow, you face the pet of the Titans." And that's where we'll leave tonight's session.
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: (scared panting)
Travis: We're gonna kill a kraken!
Marisha: No!
Liam: No!
Laura: No!
Marisha: Kill a kraken!
Sam: No, don't kill a kraken.
Marisha: Right, we're not gonna kill a kraken.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: We are going to not kill it.
Taliesin: We are going to irritate a kraken.
Laura: We are going to--
Taliesin: We are going to make it--
Travis: Holy shit!
Laura: -- We're going to steal some kraken's poop.
Travis: I have no idea what that means.
Marisha: We're gonna collect kraken droppings.
Travis: I don't know what a kraken is like in D&D, but I'm fucking stoked to find out.
Taliesin: We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken.
Marisha: We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken.
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: Oh, I'm so gonna bring a bottle of Kraken next game!
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: (excited shouting)
Taliesin: You know what else we're gonna do? We're not gonna finish it.
Marisha: We're not gonna finish it.
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Yeah, we're not gonna finish it.
Marisha: That's game, we do not finish it.
Matt: That's kind of perfect.
Laura: We're gonna drink most of it.
Liam: (chuckles)
Taliesin: We're gonna drink most of it, but we're not gonna kill the kraken.
Marisha: Except for like one-fourth of it.
Laura: Yeah. TALIESIN. Don't. 'Cause we don't kill the kraken.
Marisha: We let it live.
Liam: We're gonna give that thing some maylox. (proot fart sound)
Taliesin: Don't kill the kraken.
Travis: Nice job, Matt!
Matt: Nice job, you guys.
Travis: Nice C!
Taliesin: Good game. Good game.
Laura: C!
Matt: All right. We'll bring this up next week on Thursday for the last leg of Keyleth's Aramente--
Sam: Hey.
Matt: -- as the party might face a kraken!
Laura: Oh my goodness!
Matt: That'll be interesting.
Liam: One of 17.
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Yo momma is the kraken.
Marisha: That's what I'm most afraid of!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: I've already thought about it.
Taliesin: Long John Silver!
Travis: Wow. No, no, no, no.
Marisha: That she's the full Long John Silver.
Taliesin: She's gonna go pirate, she's gonna have a patch and a beard--
Marisha: And a peg leg!
Taliesin: -- and a peg leg.
Marisha: She totally has a peg leg.
Laura: Ew.
Taliesin: And like a little cuttlefish instead of a instead of a parrot.
Marisha: (gasps)
Laura: Rad!
Marisha: My mom's a pirate!
Laura: Definitely.
Liam: (singing)
Taliesin: (joins singing)
Marisha: (joins singing)
Sam: That is not the key at all.
Travis: Oh god, get us out of here.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: All righty, guys. (all laugh)
Matt: We'll pick up next week on Thursday. (laughs) Thank you so much for watching. Thank you again, Tor Books, for sponsoring.
Sam: (incoherent background noise) Tor Books, toy boats, Tor Books.
Liam: Tor Books.
Matt: Wyrmwood for being awesome. We're gonna go ahead and rest. Oh, I forgot to mention. I will be on the Rollplay live anniversary game on Saturday. I'm actually flying up to Canada to go play with them in person. So-- (all cheer)
Matt: I'm gonna be jumping in for one episode of the Swan Song series.
Travis: Are you gonna play?
Matt: That will be fun. Yeah! I get to play!
Sam: In Canada?
Liam: In Canada?
Matt: Up in Canada, yeah.
Sam: Each d20 is actually worth 22 up there. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Is that where you have to roll backwards?
Sam: Yeah.
Taliesin: You roll backwards there?
Matt: Yeah, that's how it works.
Marisha: And, as always, don't forget to watch Talks Machina on Tuesday--
Laura: On Tuesday!
Matt: With Brian.
Marisha: With Brian Foster!
Matt: That will be fun.
Marisha: At 7pm.
Liam: Matt's always talking about his campaign up in Canada, I'm not sure if it's real or not. (all laugh)
Marisha: What are you talking about, guys?
Matt: It is real!
Marisha: This is fine.
Matt: It's real!
Laura: Totally real.
Marisha: This is great!
Matt: Anyway. Have a wonderful night, guys. Rest well. Laura, get up early.
Laura: I know!
Matt: I'm sorry. Is it Thursday yet?

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. For our 99th episode, which is crazy, that's absolute batshit. Makes next week the 100th, which is crazy, even more crazy, and we'll be more crazy.
Travis: You did the math wrong there. Oh no, that's right.
Matt: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, intelligence six. Anyway, guys, welcome! We have an awesome guest. Tonight Jon Heder will be joining us-- (cheering)
Ashley: Who is it? Who is it?
Matt: -- at the point in the narrative in which his character will arrive. But, before then, let's go ahead and get to our announcements for the evening. First and foremost, we have a new merch item, I believe.
Laura: Yes, we do!
Matt: Laura, if you want to introduce it and possibly--
Laura: Oh, well I know some of you have been wanting to hear more about Scanlan, and we thought it would be great to release a concert tee of his. Wait, turn around, because it's even better on the back. (cheering)
Laura: And if you notice, he's got a few canceled appearances there at the end because--
Sam: Because he died.
Travis: Because he's a traitorous bitch.
Laura: Yeah, and it's pretty cool, so there's that. And that's in the store right now! Go check it out.
Marisha: Oh my god, right now.
Travis: Enter the Meat Man.
Sam: If we can't have Scanlan, at least we've got the shirt.
Laura: That's right. That's right.
Liam: And good memories. (laughter)
Laura: Maybe, maybe we'll see Scanlan in concert sometime.
Marisha: And we'll be like, "We used to hang out with him before he was famous."
Laura: Yeah, before he was famous. Marisha, you've got a little food on your mouth. Under your lip. You got it.
Sam: Announcements continue!
Matt: Yes, so anyway, other things. The campaign guide, the Tal'Dorei campaign guide, info is up on the Green Ronin website. If you're looking for it, they have dates of release, price points, and where you can find it and when. So if you go to the Green Ronin website, Google search for Green Ronin, they have a section there for the front page that has all the updates, or you can look at @GreenRoninPub on twitter. They have the updates there as well. I also retweeted it on my twitter so you can find it there. But that should answer your questions. We've gotten a bunch today. Also, tomorrow and Saturday, up in Seattle, the actual folks at Dungeons & Dragons are doing the Stream of Annihilation, in which they're having a bunch of people from the community coming out there to play games together, mix it up, be crazy, and unveil their new story setting which I'm really excited for you guys to find out about. But as part of that, Marisha, Taliesin, Liam, and myself will be going up there and playing some games. I'll be running a game on Saturday morning with the Guts, Girls, Glory group. And that is going to be a lot of fun. So you should come watch. Find the information at the official Dungeons and Dragons twitter, and we'll look forward to seeing you guys over the next couple of days up there as well.
Laura: I'll be in Las Vegas this weekend for--
Liam: Gambling?
Laura: No, for Gears of War event.
All: Ooh!
Laura: So if you guys play Gears of War competitively, come out and fight and then see me while I'm there.
Travis: Are you going to play competitive Gears of War?
Laura: No, but I'm going to cheer people on, though, real good. (laughter)
Matt: Well, cool, awesome! Also, next weekend, not this, but the weekend after that, I'll be at A-Kon June 8-11 in Fort Worth, Texas.
Travis: I went to college there.
Matt: Yeah, Travis went to college there.
Matt: Also, wanted to let you guys know that there is a charity banquet event happening at the event, which is going to be a two- to three-hour dinner, meal provided. Hang out. I'll be a part of that. You can come actually talk to me in person. One of the few guaranteed ways I'll have an opportunity to interface with people, so you don't have to wait in line for it necessarily. It's an add-on to your con ticket, and if you're there, the proceeds of that ticket all go to the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital. So it's a cool event, happy to support an awesome charity, and hopefully get to see some of you guys there. Wednesday Club, Taliesin, what you got coming up?
Taliesin: We're talking about the Young Avengers this next week. We just finished Wonder Woman; it was a great time. We wore tiaras and capes and talked.
Marisha: Did you really?
Taliesin: Matt wore the cape and I wore the tiara. It was really good.
Sam: The Young Avengers?
Taliesin: We're going to be talking about the Young Avengers which are--
Sam: Kid Hulk, Kid Iron Man.
Taliesin: You are-- Hulkling. And Iron Lad. But we're going to be talking about the teenage superheroes of the Marvel U, specifically the ones who take the Avengers name, and they're really fun and the modern take on them is really going to be influencing a lot of the stuff that ends up on TV and it's going to be a lot of fun. They're some of my favorite books; they're badass.
Matt: Awesome, thank you, Taliesin. Check out Wednesday Club. And of course we have Talks Machina live on Tuesday next week, about this episode you're gonna see tonight, at 7PM Pacific Time here on Twitch and Alpha, hosted by our fantastic Brian Wayne Foster.
All: Brian Wayne Foster!
Matt: Yes, so check it out, then.
Laura: I've got one.
Matt: What you got?
Laura: I didn't put it on the list.
Matt: No, you didn't.
Laura: But it's a present for Liam O'Brien. (cheering)
Laura: I didn't get to give him his birthday present last week, and now I do get to.
Liam: (shrieks)
Marisha: I just remembered it was your birthday.
Liam: Oh my goodness.
Laura: I wrapped it all pretty, open it up.
Liam: Okay, with a thank-you in advance and afterwards as well.
Laura: Open it up!
Liam: We'll edit this part out, right? I just meant the unwrapping.
Sam: It's a ring box.
Travis: Please be a turd.
Laura: It's just a pile of blue poop.
Liam: Oh. Oh my god.
Laura: Did you see it?
Liam: Yes. Not big enough. It's a-- aw, man-- it's beautiful.
Travis: What is it?
Liam: It's a ring and it's got raven feathers on it and a little black gem. And on the inside it says, "Do not go far from me."
Travis: Aw! Wow, twinsies.
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: You're welcome. I don't know if it will fit you, but you know, happy birthday.
Sam: Is it a genuine gold-style ring?
Laura: Did it fit?
Liam: It fit.
Laura: I guessed it! Yes!
Liam: It is beautiful. I love it so much. Perfect. Love it. That's a great birthday present.
Laura: Well, all right.
Matt: That's really awesome. Happy birthday. Both of you guys after the fact. Yay. All right, then. Unless anyone has anything else? Let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back. So, where we last left off, Vox Machina had discovered that one of their companions, the most recent addition to their team, Taryon Darrington, had gone missing, seemingly taken by a bounty hunter who had masqueraded as a pastry chef and was retrieving him to be returned to Wildmount within the city of Deastok to the rest of the Darrington family. Upon heading them off the pass and retrieving Taryon, you all made your way to Deastok and spoke with the rest of the Taryon Darrington family and discovered, it seems, that they have gone into serious debt. There's been a long-running agreement between the Darringtons and a criminal syndicate known as the Myriad that seems to be very prominent in Wildmount. And as the years have gone by, that debt has compounded and compounded to the point where they were threatening to take everything from the Darrington family and toss them onto the street. Your father, Howaardt, told you that his plan to prevent this from happening was to marry you off to a very rich and powerful family up in the capital in the kingdom, and you decided to look for other options. You went and spoke with a gentleman named Korshad who was within a secret bar beneath the Grumpy Lily tavern where a bunch of, it seems, Myriad and other lowlives go to drink, be merry, and go about their business in a safer environment. You seemed to talk with him about a possibility of making some sort of arrangement, and an accord was made where if you went and cleansed a nearby platinum mine of Herethis, that had seemingly been overrun with some sort of awoken entity that had prevented them from mining the platinum, and are losing a lot of money-- if you were to destroy this creature or cleanse the mines of the threats to it, they would forgive some of the debt. They would still take the lands from the Darrington family, but they would leave the estate, they would leave whatever remains on that land, and would not mess with them any further, thus ending the contract and still leaving a comfortable lifestyle for the family. You agreed to this, made your way to the Herathis platinum mines, delved deep into the open sinkhole that seemed to consume a portion of its construct, and discovered what had awoken within, a strange, once-seeded celestial that had been awoken too early and too young. As such, its weird, angelic, baby-like form had withered and twisted, and in battling the celestial, which manipulated the terrain around you, you managed to defeat it and destroy it before it could escape, gathered some of its remaining glittery ashes, if you will, and proceeded to fly up through the sinkhole as the rest of the ankheg swarm that seemed to parade through the tunnels within began to swarm up the sides and spit acid at you as you escaped out the top. Into the moonlit sky looking down below, you could see the swarm now crawling up and out of the maw of this mine, and that's where we left off. So as you've all just emerged out of the central portion of the mine, taking a deep breath as you're now suddenly out of the immediate danger, you can look down and see the dozens of large insectoid-like ankhegs now clambering up to the top on the edge, some of them seemingly shooting jets of acid too far away to make any impact, but they are intent definitely on trying to either shoo you off of their territory or hit at some sort of lucky impact. What do you guys want to do?
Sam: I, Taryon Darrington, would like to call to the rest of the gang and say: Wait, before we fly away, hold.
Taliesin: Superman.
Sam: Oh, okay. Thought it was some sort of power move.
Laura: How are we positioned, again?
Matt: So you have the broom riders. You have Percival on your broom. You're flying with your wings. And everyone else is on the carpet.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: I would like to just sort of shout to my friends. Oi, can we, just before we go, could we maybe just swoop down one more time? Just a quick flyby. I have an idea. I feel like we need just an insurance policy when we go talk to the Myriad fellow. I was wondering if Kiki here could maybe throw a spell down before we leave? Is that something?
Travis: You just go down by yourself, right?
Laura: Do you have any spells left?
Marisha: I do still have some spells left. It depends on what you want to do, though, and what I have prepared.
Sam: Well here's a question  can you make it look like the mouth of the cave isn't there anymore? Has caved in or is covered in dirt or rocks or something?
Marisha: I can. I have a few options for that.
Laura: Why do you want that?
Sam: As I said, I feel like when we talk to the Myriad fellow-- oh wait, let me fly over to you. (laughter)
Sam: I feel like when we talk to the Myriad fellow, we have lost our bargaining position at this point, because we did what he asked. But if we hide the mouth of the cave from him, then we have information that he needs, like where did it go, how do you get in, that kind of thing. I was also hoping maybe dear Pike could leave some sort of a trap, again as just an insurance policy.
Ashley: Like a glyph situation?
Sam: Yes, some sort of a thing that would explode when someone comes by. But I know it's crawling with characters down there, so I don't-- should we wait? I don't know.
Ashley: I could do such a thing.
Marisha: I can do a Hallucinatory Terrain, which I could do right now because I do have it learned. It covers a 150-foot cube, which I don't know-- How wide is the hole?
Matt: Is it a 150-foot cube? That would cover pretty much the sinkhole itself. Do keep in mind the agreement was to cleanse the mine, not just of the creature but of the infestation.
Laura: Oh, we have to kill all the fuckers?
Matt: Or at least enough to the point where the infestation is no longer an issue.
Travis: Tary, can you tinker up some Raid real quick?
Sam: I cannot. Wait, we have to kill more of these fuckers?
Laura: Maybe we just get high enough that they can't get to us with the acid, and then we just fire things down at them.
Liam: Roughly speaking, how many of those did we see when we came up?
Matt: You saw probably close to a hundred. There were a few that you destroyed on the way up, or some that got wrecked. But you probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of I'd say anywhere from 60 to 70 that are now visibly coming up the wall. You can see in the moonlight-- you can see the walls moving.
Marisha: Well, we can if we gather them in one place. Are they attracted to anything like shiny things or movement?
Travis: We need bait.
Taliesin: Us.
Matt: You're not sure. They seem to have been drawn by the sounds and the movement of the combat you had at the bottom of the cavern. It took them long enough for the battle you had to get down there, and now they're skittering back up the wall as you guys, with your torchlight, are making your way up towards the bank
Taliesin: I might just start shooting there if they keep coming.
Liam: T.D., do you have anything that lets you teleport us all?
Sam: No. Not really. I can become invisible and fly down there.
Taliesin: Do you have any good terrain modifier something to trash them?
Marisha: So they're attracted to movement and sound. Percy, you have a very loud banging thing.
Taliesin: I do.
Marisha: If we can get them all clumped together, I can throw down a few Fireballs and Flaming Spheres and probably take a lot of them out. But I need them clumped together.
Taliesin: What do we have that's dead in the Bag of Holding right now? Let's just start throwing them down some things to eat and I'm going to start making some noise.
Marisha: Are they still on the walls?
Matt: You can see a lot of them are still making their way towards the mouth of the cavern. There's probably about 25 or so that are gathered around the outside. Some of them are spreading a little bit out, trying to get towards where you are on the edges of the hole. If you wanted to move towards the top, you might draw them towards the edge.
Taliesin: Let's fly above it and I'll take a few shots and we'll just start dropping things down.
Liam: One other idea. What if I go in as bait, make a lot of noise, and as they swarm I throw Whisper and throw it into his shoulder blades, and then on I'm piggyback.
Laura: No. What? Why? They're already at the top.
Liam: Yes, but would the Fireball, where they are, encompass them all or-- I'm just saying if they--
Marisha: Not all of them, but I can get a lot of them.
Sam: I can also throw some Fireballs.
Marisha: Yeah, we can Fireball together.
Laura: Percy and I just fly up and we start firing down.
Taliesin: I'm going to start making noise and just boom-booming.
Marisha: I point to a spot for Percy to see if I can get them to gather there, and I start readying a Fireball to launch.
Matt: Okay, so the two of you fly over to that side, and you start making Bad News explosion clatter as your gargantuan firearm just (gunshot noises).
Taliesin: Yeah, some shots at them as I go.
Matt: And you take one or two of them down through repeated shots as their armor cracks and breaks and you hear (dying noises).
Taliesin: We'll throw some meat down there too.
Liam: Is the noise centered on your gun, though, and not down below?
Laura: Yeah, but they'll gather in the spot to get to it.
Matt: They watch as you fly above, and you can start see them shooting these jets of acid in the arc as it begins to spray through, and you mark a little bit to stay just out of that range as you continue to do so. But the noise you are making is-- you're watching them slowly cluster up beneath where you guys are.
Marisha: Okay, let me know when it looks like a good cluster.
Matt: You got a pretty good cluster, you could probably get about ten in one blast.
Marisha: Yeah, let's just throw down a big ol' Fireball.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: 20-foot radius.
Sam: (sings) You shake my nerve--
Travis: (sings) -- and you rattle my brain.
Travis: (sing) Too much love drives a man insane.
Ashley: (sing) Too much love drives a man insane.
All: (sing) You broke my will, oh, what a thrill. Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
Matt: And with that, for the sake of brevity on this standpoint, you wait until they begin to gather into one space, and with a singular Fireball, Keyleth, you watch as (explosion) you send four of them screeching down, falling into the pit from the blast, while six of them appear to be heavily wounded or burned to a cinder and run off screaming, before collapsing and then smoldering maybe 20 feet from the pit. More swoop up to gather into that space, now that that explosion has drawn their attention as well. And you see a few stop for a second, smelling the ruin of their companions, and you see a moment there to shoot another Fireball as soon as they're gathered. (explosion) This one finishes off any of the stragglers there and heavily damages a handful of others. You watch now, over the period of time of you both shooting, you taking arrows and what's available, over the next five to six minutes or so, you guys cut down the numbers to about half what they were. And there's now just broken wreckage of ankhegs just torn open from the explosion, their chitinous armor fractured and open with the smoldering innards burning and sizzling from the impact of the fire. They start to slow their ascent as more and more of them begin to die, and you watch as they all begin to burrow back into the earth, scattering deeper into the ground.
Marisha: Hey... Vax, do you still have any of that--
Laura: You had to think about it. (laughter)
Marisha: A hundred episodes, yeah. Five years, a hundred episodes later. Do you still have any of that poison? That poison-- anybody have any poison?
Travis: I do!
Marisha: You have poison?
Travis: Yep! Yep, do you want some?
Marisha: Well, I was thinking--
Travis: You got it. I pull out the jug and I yell, "Poison!"
Matt: Splashes around inside.
Marisha: That's pretty good, Grog.
Travis: Did you want to drink it?
Marisha: Well, no.
Travis: No. It's really hardcore, if you do.
Marisha: Ah, another time. I'll raincheck you, bud. Do we still have any more orc or boar parts?
Travis: No, we've got an orc, like, calf, and a foot, and it looks like a skull, covered in like, pasta sauce.
Marisha: Yeah, like actual Raid. Like Raid. Like if we dip, maybe, some food in poison and throw it down there, everyone that's left will come and eventually eat it and die.
Laura: I think we have, like, 40 or 50 of them left, right? And they're burrowed, now?
Matt: Some of them have burrowed and some have gotten wind of the wreckage and ruin--
Laura: (gasps) I wonder if we could send fire into the caves where they've burrowed?
Liam: Or you've created tsunamis, as well, d'you think you could flush them out?
Marisha: I could-- I do still have my sixth-level spell, I could attempt to get to a few of their tunnels and collapse their tunnels.
Sam: Can you fill the whole tunnel with water and drown them?
Marisha: I could--
Sam: Too big. Too big.
Laura: What's too big?
Sam: To fill the whole tunnel with water and drown 'em?
Laura: That's a lot.
Taliesin: We can't create chemicals, can we?
Sam: (laughs) Your mind.
Marisha: Hm, no, not really. I can create water, but I don't think it would be enough to flush them out.
Travis: I just made this poison for, like, no fucking reason? (laughter)
Taliesin: We could do shots. I'm just kidding.
Marisha: I mean, you volunteered it very quickly.
Travis: Are we just above the hole?
Matt: You're above the hole, holding the jug--
Travis: I take initiative and I take the orc leg, dunk it in the poison, toss it, then I take the last-- this is the last orc piece in the bag--
Marisha: Is that remnants of Dork, still?
Travis: I dunno. No, no. The ox is way gone, that poor bastard.
Taliesin: We burned through that ages ago.
Travis: Two little orc parts, now poisoned and...
Matt: Yeah. Two-- they're very soft. Very, like, long-cooked lamb, just dripping off the bone, you're like-- throw it off there--
Laura: We might have some stuff in the Bag of Colding.
Matt: Were they in the Bag of Colding? No. They're definitely soft.
Marisha: If I do like, a Commune with Nature, and then, because I know they're already--
Matt: Build a commune with nature?
Marisha: Commune with Nature, and I--
Liam: Whoa. Glass houses, and all of that.
Matt: I like the image of a spell that-- I just like a spell that creates a hippie commune somewhere in your fantasy world. I think it's pretty cool.
Marisha: I thought that was Conjure Fae.
Matt: True enough. Continue, what are you doing?
Marisha: Can I, because I already got a map of their tunnels. Can I then do Move Earth to, like, try and collapse?
Matt: You get the sense that as burrowing creatures, collapsing the tunnels might slow them down, but they'll probably still dig their way out.
Taliesin: What are the chances I have materials for making explosives on me?
Matt: I mean, enough to maybe, like--
Taliesin: No, but like just the materials, not the time to make them, but just the materials. Because one of the materials in making TNT is diatomaceous earth. And if it's micronized diatomaceous earth, that means it's actually an insecticide.
Travis: Fucking Taliesin Jaffe. What are you talking about?
Taliesin: Specifically for hard-shell insects.
Ashley: I have an idea! I have an idea.
Sam: Pike has an idea!
Matt: You wouldn't have anywhere near enough to do what you're trying to do.
Ashley: I'm going to--
Laura: Wait, wait, wait!
Matt: Pike?
Ashley: I would like to cast Earthquake--
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: And maybe I can wiggle it all closed.
Matt: Okay. Okay. So you cast Earthquake, what's the casting time on that?
Ashley: It's just one action.
Matt: Okay. So you look there and focus for a second, close your eyes, and you guys watch as the edges of the sinkhole begin to shift. The single tower that was partially collapsed? Collapses into full bits of rock and rubble, and some of it spills further into the tunnel as the tunnel begins to cave in. Basically, you fill in the rest of the sinkhole, and the mine now drops 25, 30 feet as the rest of the earth comes and fills it in. Eventually, the rumbling slows and comes to a calm, and you see now there's a dip where the space in the forest was-- it's like a big bowl, and some of the trees fall into it and get buried in the earth and stone as it collapses inward.
Liam: I love that everybody was up here bickering and Pike just went "hm." (laughter)
Matt: A few moments pass, and you watch as some of the ankhegs begin to pop out, like the collapsed tunnels have forced them to begin burrowing their way to the surface to orient themselves. You watch as about five, ten, 20 or so of these begin to emerge, and as they emerge they look around the space. And you watch them looking at each other and sniffing the area--
Ashley: I'm going to Fire Storm them.
Marisha: You're going to Fire Storm them?
Travis: Just let Pike off the leash.
Sam: Oh, by the way, I can create a holocaust? Is that what you're doing? (laughter)
Matt: (sings) Pike can end this world in a holocaust, in a holocaust-- All right, so. As everyone's marveling over your Earthquake, little Pike goes, "And also--" And you watch as about 30 or so of these creatures have now emerged, and they're all communicating with each other, and their antennas are going by, and they're beginning to look around-- and this streak, this zigzag of burning flame just tears across the base of this bowl and just incinerates about 20 of them. You now see them immediately smoldering, turning to ash, these blackened clusters of heavily charred husk, and the others that came to the surface just scatter into the forest. You get the sense that the ruin you've left, the collapsing of the tunnels and the rather large portion of their populace that you've left destroyed, there's probably not much of an infestation left here in the mines.
Travis: Yeah, not too bad, Vasquez.
Laura: Did we also destroy the mine?
Taliesin: Well, it's still there, it's just been filled in.
Marisha: Plus, technically isn't the point of a mine to, like, dig out holes?
Taliesin: Now they can dig extra. The Etch-A-Sketch has been shaken.
Liam: There's none left? They're all gone?
Matt: I mean, that you saw come to the surface gathered.
Laura: I think we did a good job.
Liam: We could've smushed those and gotten so drunk.
Ashley: How do you feel, Tary?
Sam: That's pretty awesome. (laughs) Yeah, I think mission accomplished. Let's go.
Travis: Yeah, I think we did it. Let's get the fuck out of here.
Matt: Okay. So. You guys make your way back towards Deastok-- Yes. Make your way back towards Deastok. You still have access to your Wind Walk, since it's not concentration, it lasts a while, so quickly enough, with your equipment in place, you guys can traverse rapidly back to the city in which you began this journey. You make your way back to The Grumpy Lily, introduce yourself to the two denizens within, with the phrase, if you recall.
Travis: Chicken and biscuits.
Sam: The Many, the Many, yes.
Matt: The same elderly gentleman is like, "Well, okay," and shuffles over and opens the same doorway that leads you through the stairs, into the central hallway where there's that one gruff guy on the stool, he recognizes you, nudges you and opens the door. And you step into the tavern. It's not as busy as it was last time, it's probably about maybe two-thirds of the clientele there, but the music's still going, there's people chatting, having drinks, and at a different table you see Korshad just sitting alone, hands still crossed, cup half-full, still resting beneath him. And as soon as you enter, his eyes are trained on you. Whether it was expectant or just sheer luck, or his eyes are always trained on whoever enters the door, as soon as you enter the establishment, you watch as his smile cracks the sides of his mouth and his-- the edges of his eyes, the little crows' feet curl up a bit. And he motions you over.
Marisha: Do you think he has friends? He's always alone.
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to start eyeballing the room while sis goes and talks.
Travis: Is Camilla still playing music?
Matt: The musicians are not currently playing.
Laura: What time is it now?
Matt: At this point, it's early morning. I'll say for the purposes of the hour that you got there, best that I can recall, it's like 1:30 in the morning. It's pretty late.
Sam: Excuse me, may we sit and talk?
Matt: "But of course. Have a seat."
Sam: Thank you. We have done our share of the bargain, and we're here to cash in our chit, as it were.
Matt: His head looks at you. "You did not leave but a number of hours ago. Am I to expect that you have completed this task already?"
Laura: Yeah, we're really, really good.
Marisha: And you should know that if you've apparently been watching us?
Matt: He motions his finger up towards one of the second rows, and you watch as one of the guards there, the ones that you've noticed before and kept your eyes on that have the hidden crossbows, knocks on the edge of a door that opens up slightly. He whispers to somebody and a few moments later another guard walks up, escorting what looks to be a young mousy woman of red-brown skin. Her eyes, as soon as you get a glance, are snow-blind. And you watch as the guard that's with her is actually holding her arm and guiding her as she walks. She has big black curls that trail down to her middle back and as she's led to the table Korshad gives a little whistle. And a drink is brought at her place and she sits down. Looks a little confused and nervous, but sits down and leans into Korshad, and he turns to her and says, "This is Duala. She will confirm your words. Duala?" She glances her face over past your group and as she does, she reaches into a pouch and brings out what looks to be a few stone runes. And she clatters them across the table. And as soon as she puts her fingers out in front and spreads them like that, the runes all magnetically (scraping) shift to match the placement of her fingers below. Her snow-blind eyes now go pure white. And there's just a moment where you watch as her head begins to drift back like a slow hinge.
Marisha: Do I recognize this spell?
Matt: You do not.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: At least not this form of casting. After a minute or so, her eyes come back to their snow-blind appearance, her fingers curl back in and with a very small voice she goes, "The mine is cleansed, though the mine is also collapsed." Korshad's looking at her, and goes, "But you say it is cleansed, yes. Of everything?" She gives a nod. "It is free." He looks back to you all with a very sly, begrudging brow, one eye still partially closed. "Very well. We will send men to confirm the depths of this, and operations will begin. If at any point it is discovered that this was some sort of charade or the means of our agreement were not met fully, we will be happy to make sure the rest of the Darrington estate falls back squarely under our grasp. However, for the time being and if what you say is true..." He reaches under the table and sifts through a small sack that he had held between his feet and ankles, pulls out a heavy piece of parchment. "The deed to the Darrington estate. Signed over to one Taryon Darrington."
Sam: Might I make a few more requests? When last we spoke, we spoke in vague terms. There was some cash talked about, and also a place for my family to make a little bit of money or food. There's a farmhouse nearby our main estate. It's nothing special, a few acres of land. I would love to keep that as well so that we can have a source of food for the winters.
Matt: Make a persuasion check, Mr. Doe-Eyed Young'un.
Laura: Blink-blink!
Sam: 22.
Matt: 22. "Hmm. You are young. Not yet spoiled by the strange truths of the world around you. I admire your optimism in the face of the unknown. It may be your salvation or it may be your end. Only time will tell. I'll give you this farmland."
Sam: We are most grateful.
Matt: "But. If at any point your family comes back to me requesting any more inches in our agreement, I will happily take it back."
Sam: Understood. I wasn't quite finished yet, though.
Matt: He leans back in his chair, his arms now being removed from his mouth and going to an expectant cross.
Sam: What we saw down there in the platinum mines was the 230,000 gold that we owe you times ten. Times 20. What we've just done for you has given you access to as much money as you could ever want, and I feel that's valuable. My family will require a bit of spending money to get ourselves back on our feet. We are... accustomed to a lifestyle, and we'd like to maintain it for a little while at least. I'd say 50,000 gold should be about enough to last us for a year or two.
Matt: He nods, leans forward. "Then you'd better start saving."
Sam: What if I sweetened the deal? We have among us an amazing sorceress who could open that mine up for you with a flick of her wrist, save you hours and hours of work. Possibly back-breaking work that could cost the lives of many of your men.
Matt: "That would be a very kind gesture towards the state you left the mine in."
Sam: (clears throat) So that's a maybe?
Matt: "Let's call it the last thread of my patience, young Darrington."
Sam: So that's a hard yes. (laughter)
Matt: "Duala, you may return to your quarters." "Thank you very much." She gets up and looks past you all with a nod, and then her guardian escorts her back into the chamber as Korshad is just trained on you. "What I have given you is far more than many in my position would. I will work hard to make sure that this softness I have displayed does not hinder my reputation. And the more you press, the more you may be the end of that softness, my friend. I recommend you stick to the deal we've made. Be happy that I've shown any mercy. And be on your way."
Sam: All right. I'll make do, and we'll have to adjust our living standards, that's all.
Matt: "Indeed. Perhaps your father might raise a finger or two and earn some money for himself."
Sam: We'll see. Thank you. Bidet.
Matt: "Good evening."
Laura: He almost said it back.
Sam: Almost.
Laura: We're starting something.
Matt: He takes a drink, and sips it, and gives this motion with his hand as his eyes finally avert from Taryon and the rest of your group and he looks away with a contemplative expression. As he does so, you watch as the guards all begin to shift out of the crowd. And you watch as many of the various tavern folk that were laughing and drinking are all quiet now, looking upon the rest of you.
Travis: That's some Moriarty shit right there.
Matt: And you get the sense that pretty much everybody in this establishment, patron or not, are all keeping an eye on this. They're all part of Korshad's guard in some way, shape or form, and you've been given leave.
Marisha: You're totally right, he has so many friends.
Taliesin: I told you.
Travis: Let's do this. Everyone dies. Everybody. Let's light it up.
Matt: You watch as Wence comes up to you, as this is happening, and goes, "Hi. Look. You seem like very nice folk. You should probably..." (clicks tongue)
Laura: We're leaving.
Matt: "Okay, good. Drink for the road?" And he gives you a little shot, to you, Vex, and goes, (tongue click).
Ashley: But why do we have to go? I'm just kidding. (laughter)
Ashley: I just really like it here!
Matt: And that was the end of Vox Machina's story. No. All right. You make your way out, back up through the Grumpy Lily, back onto the streets of the deep, deep dark morning hours in Deastok. What do you wish to do?
Marisha: Wow, that was weird, you guys. It was weird.
Laura: Do we need to tell your family what we did?
Sam: Absolutely.
Liam: Break the news to dad, yeah?
Laura: Right now. In the morning?
Sam: I guess maybe in the morning? They're probably all asleep now.
Laura: Well, I haven't actually had the drink yet, I was afraid it might be poisoned.
Sam: Yeah, maybe not.
Taliesin: I'm going to steal a sip of the drink.
Laura: (gasps) Percival!
Matt: Make a con-- no, I'm kidding. (laughter)
Taliesin: I haven't swallowed it, I'm just going, hmm, hmm.
Laura: How is he?
Matt: It numbs a bit of the surface skin, seems like a strong alcohol.
Laura: You're fine? All right, fine. All right. Congratulations, us. Maybe later.
Travis: We are a little beat up and stuff.
Laura: We should probably heal up. Talk to your father in the morning.
Sam: We'll go to my house.
Taliesin: Your house!
Marisha: It is now your house.
Sam: Yes, it is.
Liam: Whose house? T's house.
Taliesin: Well done.
Laura: It's in your name.
Marisha: You're a homeowner.
Sam: I could get a second mortgage!
Laura: You could kick your dad out!
Marisha: You get to pay property taxes!
Sam: Oh, god.
Ashley: You could refinance!
Sam: I could refinance. I hear mortgage rates are really low right now.
Laura: I hear the Myriad's giving really good deals.
Matt: So you make your way back to the Darrington estate?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Okay. The guest quarters are cramped for the volume of travelers you have with you, but as you approach and knock on the door, there's a slight pause before your...
Sam: Berthold?
Matt: Yes, thank you. Berthold, the brass-skinned dragonborn companion comes up with his nightcap on in front of his face, and he's got his little lantern. He's like, "I assume you wish to stay here. I'll arrange for... Come in, come in." He rubs his eyes as he leads you inside. It's quiet and still, and the house is dark. No light aside from the small lantern that Berthold has, and he leads you on the bottom floor to the guest quarters, which are two separate rooms, each with a singular bed. You watch as he begins to grab cushions from various chairs and display sofas that are covered in dust, that haven't been sat in for a decade, at least, and is trying to arrange them in a haphazard floor bedding scenario.
Taliesin: I want to see where he's going with this.
Matt: He gets to a point where he gives up and goes, "Oh, there. Good night." And walks away.
Laura: Well, we've slept in blanket forts before.
Liam: Not the first, not the last.
Marisha: I get the big cushion!
Taliesin: It's got a bar in the middle.
Marisha: Display furniture sucks.
Matt: You still do have your room, Taryon, if you want to use it.
Sam: My room? Oh, yeah, of course I'm going up there.
Travis: Oh, really, you're going to leave us down here? Fucking high-born piece of shit?
Sam: All right, I'll stay back down here with the pillow fort thing. Fine. But after they go to sleep, I go upstairs and go back to my bed.
Matt: Okay, then. Make a stealth check.
Sam: Oh, Jesus. Four.
Matt: Half of you open an eye in the middle of the night as you hear the creaking of the wood flooring.
Sam: Just going to the bathroom!
Liam: By the way, do you have any beast changing left in you?
Marisha: I do, yeah.
Liam: Could you go Minxie for me?
Laura: Oh, kinky.
Travis: Gross, we're all in the same room.
Marisha: Yes, why?
Liam: I want a pillow.
Marisha: Fine.
Taliesin: That is the most Brian Blessed thing ever.
Laura: You could've just used Trinket.
Matt: Trinket farts are an issue. Then again, so are Minxie farts.
Ashley: I want to get in a circle, like a dog, on one of the cushions.
Taliesin: You turn around three times.
Matt: That's how rock gnomes sleep, they do a little circle around the cushion.
Liam: I just turn into Macklemore.
Matt: All right. So you make it to your room, left as it was. Most of the furniture is covered in sheets, but untouched as to where you left it the last time you were here. There's a firm layer of dust across most of it, and as you step into the room, with each step you can see the footfalls leaving a small trail on the floor. You have a large shelf of books that line the right wall. You can see the footsteps to and from the bookshelf where it seems like your mother has taken, here and there, little elements of your collection. You see the covered outline of your workbench, which inhabits the far side of the chamber, and a familiar smell of old oil and leathers immediately causes a flood of memories to hit you of growing up in this space. You do see, poking out from one of these sheets, some of the leftover pieces from when you constructed your first Doty, and you see the armored hand, partially open with some of the gears and runes only partially put into the hand and then discarded and left to the side, and it also reminds you of those years. You have this nostalgic wave hit you as you pull the sheet off your bed, and dust it out, and fluff your pillow, and for the first time in a long time, have a night's sleep in your own chambers.
Sam: I'll cuddle with the Doty arm.
Matt: It's very cold, but sleep does take you. You guys finish your evening's rest. You awake. After the stress of the previous battle of the day, you all tend to sleep in for the most part, plus the late hour of eventually getting to rest. You all eventually come to later in the morning, closer to noon, but as you wake up, you wake up to the smell of food being cooked. You make your way out into the central foyer area of the estate, and you can see Berthold is running around the kitchen, desperately trying to put together whatever meal is viable, and eventually shouts out, "Breakfast is served!"
Liam: What you got, Bertie?
Matt: "It's... dinner time! Dinner you're having-- breakfast, staying the night, and the market wasn't open."
Laura: Potatoes!
Matt: "Potatoes. Some bread, might be a bit stale. I made some stew. Breakfast stew. It's just stew, but you're having it for breakfast. Some mushrooms. That's it. I am sorry."
Liam: A lot of carbs.
Taliesin: It's like Comic Con all over again.
Travis: Is this how we're supposed to eat in the house of Darrington, Tary?
Laura: We just used up all of their food and they don't have any left.
Sam: I'm sorry. I'll talk to the help about this.
Travis: Can't you pop a crystal off of that helmet of yours and make a banquet?
Sam: No. I could burn us all alive, though, with one of them.
Travis: Not the same thing.
Taliesin: Did we ever discover whether or not the magic jug does coffee?
Sam: Only one way to find out.
Travis: Only one way to find out. Hold on. Be my guest.
Liam: Americano.
Travis: Nope.
Sam: How about tea?
Taliesin: Tea.
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: It can make alcohol and poison, but it can't make an English breakfast? Bullshit.
Laura: English breakfast ale!
Travis: Baked beans and sausages and-- ! No.
Marisha: Yeah, breakfast ale. That works.
Matt: As you guys complete your breakfast, you notice that eventually Maryanne's voice begins to echo through the stairway. She comes down and goes, "My word, Berthold, what are you cooking this-- " She comes down. You can see her hair is curled in front of her face and pulled back and tied up into this tight bun in the back, and she's just wearing this long, deep blue robe over her casual silk blouse attire and pants. She glances down, holding onto the railing. "Good morning."
Sam: Good morning, sister. These are my friends, Vox Machina.
Ashley: Hello.
Matt: "Right."
Sam: Grog, Pike, Vex, Vax, Percy, Keyleth.
Matt: "Pleasure. Brother, I wasn't aware we had company staying."
Sam: I travel with a group now.
Matt: "I've heard. I just didn't realize..."
Sam: I bring news, and I know it's early, but could we have a little family meeting over breakfast?
Laura: It's super important.
Matt: She gives you such a stink eye. "I'll go speak to Father."
Sam: And Mama.
Matt: "And Mama." And she heads up the stairs.
Marisha: She seems nice.
Sam: She is not.
Laura: I like her a lot.
Matt: About five minutes pass, and you hear the sound of multiple footfalls as the rest of the Darrington family makes their way down. First you have Maryanne, same attire, but she's a little more put together. You can see now she's left the robe behind to have more of her classic formal presenting-to-company outfit. Behind her you have Mariya, your mother, who is in practically the same outfit she was in yesterday. She really doesn't seem to care at this point, it's more about being comfortable.
Laura: Sweat pants!
Matt: A few feet behind, to his own entrance, there you see with his thick mutton chops and a tied-over, deep red, burgundy coat, Howaardt Darrington. As they all enter, Mariya immediately runs forward and goes, "Oh, I didn't realize breakfast was going to be made!" She goes over and takes a little plate and starts filling it with rolls and potatoes. She goes up and rubs your head a little bit and kisses you on the forehead, and goes, "It's nice to have company."
Sam: It's nice to be home.
Laura: Did you want some stew?
Matt: "Oh, yes."
Matt: Howaardt, at this point, is sitting back next to Maryanne, and goes (clears throat).
Laura: Oh, did you want some as well?
Matt: "I'm fine for now. Your sister tells me that we are to have a family meeting."
Sam: Yes, and with your permission, I would like to invite my friends to stay for it as well, as it does concern them.
Liam: Hey.
Marisha: Hi!
Taliesin: Charmed.
Matt: "Very well."
Sam: I bring you news, and I bring you a proposal, and as a businessman I hope you'll listen to both.
Matt: He seems keen at the choice of words. "Yes, my son."
Sam: First, the news. It's good news. First, I will not be marrying this Lydia person. There's no need, and also I think we all know I would not be happy in such a marriage, and we should all be free to pursue whomever we love. That's beside the point. It's not necessary, because I have made a deal with the Myriad. A deal that will spare us from any danger, and clear us from all debt. We-- Well, they, really, carried out a task for the Myriad that has absolved us of the debt that you ran up, and we are free and clear.
Matt: He looks to Mariya and Maryanne and softens up. "I am... If what you say is true, then this is indeed a great day, and I owe each and every one of you a great debt. We owe you a great debt."
Taliesin: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, but thank you.
Sam: Yes, they don't-- Forgive me for speaking on your behalf. I don't think that they want to collect on a debt. They just did this because we're friends. The forgiveness of debt comes with some strings attached. We will lose most of our property and assets, but we will maintain the homestead here, and all of its possessions and artwork and belongings, we get to keep. We also get the nearby farmhouse and all of the land, and we get a new lease on life, and a new beginning. I think it's an opportunity for our family, and that leads me to my proposal. Father, as much as I have respected you for keeping us safe and providing for us, you have not given us the one thing a family needs, which is love. Real love. You have made sure that we are safe, because you care about our blood, because it is your blood, and you care about the fact that we bear your name, but you haven't given us the opportunity to be a real family, and I believe we can be, if we start out new and fresh together. Here's my proposal. I will come back and live with you, in Wildmount, and I will lead this family to a new chapter. Our business model will change a bit. I propose that we do not engage in real estate anymore, but in another venture. Forgive me, but you have sullied our name.
Matt: Maryanne, at this point, says, "No, brother, you have!" And you watch as Howaardt puts his hand out in front and dad-hands her, immediately, and pushes her back, not stopping his gaze from you. His jaw clenches tight as he clears his throat and his hands go back behind his body.
Sam: The Darrington name is one of ill repute. We are scoundrels, and we are land barons, and we are awful people, and now we are penniless awful people. But I feel that we can fix it. What I propose is this: Our home will be vacated by us. We are going to move to the farmhouse, where we will all live as a family. We will tend to the farm, and we will raise crops together. Our home will be turned into the Darrington Fund, for charitable giving, where people who are down on their luck can come and live and get back on their feet. Now, such a fund will need donors, and you have many contacts in the business world. You, and possibly sister, could run this foundation and spread goodness all over Wildmount, instead of badness and evil.
Matt: There's a flash of movement. Quicker than you've seen your father move, he has grabbed a chair behind him, and thrown it across the room, smashing it against the nearby wall. (heavy breathing)
Liam: I take a step forward and unsheathe a dagger an inch and say, we're going to keep this civil today, aren't we?
Matt: "You have no right to talk to me... You stand here and shame the work that I've done, and given my life to secure and give to you and your sister, and to uphold the mistakes that my father made to the best of my ability and fix them. And you waltz in here after a year of adventuring and just expect me to accept you throwing everything I've worked for into the sewer?"
Sam: I didn't do that, Father, you did. It's gone. Everything is gone. You don't even own your own house anymore.
Matt: "It wouldn't be that way if you would've just married that girl."
Sam: That's not going to happen. In my year of travel, I didn't just dilly-dally around the world having fun. I was learning about the world and about life and about family. I was learning from these fine people what it means to really be a family, and care about each other. I learned from Grog and Vax what it means to be a man, and to be a father. I learned from Pike what it means to be a caring mother. I learned from Keyleth what a real sister is like, one who loves you and cares for you. I learned from Vex what a best friend is like. These are things you never gave us, growing up. I even learned from Percival... the type of man I would want to marry one day. And we never got that at home. And from this day forth, I'm going to create a home, my home, that I own, that values and respects the opinions of each family member. That cares for one another. Where we stick up for each other, and help each other through hard times, and not just rule by decree. If you don't want to be a part of this, that's fine. You can leave my house. But I want you to stay. I need your counsel, and I need your help, and we need you as a father. I need you and Sister to run this foundation for me, to repair our name and our reputation. It could be great. It could be the best thing that's ever happened to us. And there's more. I have an idea. To create something else. A team of adventurers, based here in Wildmount. The Darrington Brigade, led by me, Taryon Darrington. We will fight for justice, and win battles against evildoers, and spread the Darrington name around the continent. I know I'm getting ahead of myself, but I feel like if we embarked on this new adventure together, it could save our name and repair our relationship. As a businessman, I'm asking you to consider it. Because your other options are... Well, they're not great.
Matt: Make a persuasion check
Laura: The deal we made with the Myriad, sir...
Sam: I'm going to use Luck.
Laura: No one would know that you were forced out of your home. Everyone thinks that this was your choice, that you're being charitable.
Sam: I'm going to see if the fates can help me.
Travis: You're going to use it now?
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Cash it in!
Sam: That's a 25.
Matt: That's a moment to do it. You see as Mariya, your mother, has now moved to the side of Howaardt, holding his arm. "Honey, there was no other path. This is a gift." He pulls his arm from her and begins to walk toward you. You watch as Maryanne has put on a shocked face, gone pale white, and for a moment, the facade of the adult gives away to the child. "Father." As he walks up to you, you watch as he brings his hand up, and falls into his own hand, and falls to his knees on the ground. He's shaking, he's quaking. His fist is clenched there, and he slams it into the ground, once, twice, a third time, each one a resounding knock of him hitting bone and skin against wood. And he does it again, and again, and again, all the anger and fury being focused into this. As he stops, you can see the blood pouring from the side of the knuckles, and his hand is shaking. He stops and looks at it. (deep breath) And for the first time-- not even the other evening, in which there was a sort of feigned softness to him, that you have read through before and seen-- for the first time you see your father as a broken man. He looks up at you. "I lost everything. I did this to us." He looks back at Mariya, and Maryanne, and to you. The dampness gathering down the side of his wrinkled cheeks, gathering across the stubble on his chin, and vanishing amongst the cluster of thin, bristly facial hair. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Sam: I am, too.
Matt: He looks about at this point. Now, his focused anger has subsided, and this emotional moment realizing that there are strangers at the table, and he (clears throat) "If you could please give us a bit of time." His hand still clustered there. He looks over to Berthold, who ushers you all out front, you staying behind, Taryon. About ten minutes or so, as you're all awkwardly waiting outside in the quiet. The cloudy day that originally brought you into Deastok is breaking in places, you see hints of blue sky peeking through, and a little bit of sunlight occasionally finding its way across the cobblestone roads of the cityscape. You hear the occasional tweet of birds as they jump from tree to tree. And in this silence you really get to take in the surrounding beauty of this town, even as oppressive and gloomy as your arrival may have been, and the tenseness of the work you had to do in this space. You allow yourself to realize that this is a nice town. You hear the door open once more from the front of the estate, and there you see Maryanne, wet on the cheeks. "My father would like to speak to you, if that's all right."
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Sure, sure.
Matt: She steps back in and Howaardt comes back. He is more composed than he was before. He is back to his presentory self. "When my son left, I was under the impression that his fanciful ideas would either break him and send him back to me to finally listen to what I had to teach, if luck was with us. If not, his fool's errand was bound to get him killed. It is by some miracle that he found you. I don't know what's in store for my children, my wife, myself. There is a lot to discuss, a lot to decide. Us as a family. And I'm still processing all of it. I'm sorry you got pulled into all of this, but I'm glad that you gave him your friendship. And I'm sorry you had to see this." He's hiding his bad hand under the good one. "I'm sure in time I'll come to appreciate this. Out of desperation and obsession, I became my father, something I promised I would never do. And I'm sorry." He looks back over his shoulder at Tary, who's a few feet behind him. "I'm sorry." Then he walks back into the house and just--
Liam: Sir.
Matt: He stops a little bit and looks back over his shoulder towards you.
Liam: Second chances are a gift. I pray you don't squander it.
Taliesin: You're not the first man to panic at the loss of his shackles. I hope you eventually enjoy the freedom that you've just been given from your legacy.
Matt: "Legacy." He continues walking into the house.
Ashley: Sir, may I have your hand, please?
Matt: He stops. "I'm sorry, what?"
Ashley: May I have your hand? Not in marriage, I worded that strangely. Just your hand that's hurt.
Matt: He's still clutching and hiding it. He gives you a look of understanding of what you're asking. "I appreciate the offer, but this needs to heal on its own."
Ashley: Understood.
Matt: "This pain shouldn't be fleeting." And he walks away inside.
Travis: I have a question. Is there any more stew?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Travis: My stomach is making noises, I'm so hungry.
Marisha: I feel like we could find better stew. No offense.
Laura: So...
Sam: Oh, yes. My place is here. I'm coming back to Whitestone with you, I have to. I have to retrieve Doty and my personal belongings.
Laura: But we just finished your room!
Sam: Well, I'll come visit. I was thinking, for my Darrington Brigade, I'll need lots of recruits, and maybe I could get some down in Whitestone. You know, fine fighters and young trainees. I even have an idea for my first adventuring partner. I think if I sold my old armor, I could afford that drow for a year, and she lives close by.
Taliesin: This is a lot.
Liam: I don't think that's a half-bad idea. We're all very proud of you.
Marisha: So proud.
Taliesin: It's very impressive.
Marisha: I understand legacy and responsibility and I think it's very admirable of you to recognize your place.
Sam: I've always known that I was not fit to travel with you all, and I know that you all love me, but you don't really like me that much. Oh, I can be kind of a dick sometime.
Laura: I like it! I like dicks!
Marisha: A year ago, it was definitely true, but now...
Travis: What about the bakery?
Sam: Oh, the bakery! I'm really bad at baking too.
Laura: No, but you're so good at selling stuff!
Sam: Yeah, I am.
Laura: I feel like some people come in just to see you and see you smile.
Marisha: Yeah, you're definitely the face guy! You're the good salesman!
Sam: Sure, sure, that makes sense.
Marisha: You can sell anyone on a shitty cake that you baked!
Sam: I'll come down and visit a lot.
Ashley: What's a lot?
Sam: You know, once every year, around Winter's Crest. Well, I mean, it's a long way, and I can't Tree Stride or whatever you call it.
Marisha: I can come get you.
Sam: Listen, let's not do this now. I'm coming back with you. I have to go get my robit. All right?
Taliesin: Well, don't expect us to be okay with this. That's not going to happen.
Marisha: I mean, to be fair, Tary does have a point. I also have a responsibility, and...
Sam: You're leaving, too?
Taliesin: Yes. Well, technically...
Marisha: I'm the chief of my people.
Sam: Oh my god, are we all breaking up?
Laura: What?! No!
Ashley: We're not doing this now! What's happening? What is happening?
Sam: I didn't mean to do this! I didn't know this was going to happen!
Taliesin: There's no more discussion until there's food and caffeine. This is madness.
Ashley: We're just hungry! We're just hungry.
Taliesin: This is hunger talking.
Travis: We're just feeling hangry as shit.
Ashley: Everybody needs to calm down.
Taliesin: We need brunch.
Travis: All right. We'll get brunch back in Whitestone, right, and get out of here?
Laura: Let's go to Whitestone. Let's leave. I don't like this place anymore.
Travis: Let's go, then. You don't say one word. No, you shut up.
Sam: I need to go say good-bye to Mama, that's it, then I can go, all right?
Taliesin: She can come to Whitestone anytime.
Sam: She literally has no money to travel.
Taliesin: We can make it happen.
Travis: Well, say your goodbyes.
Sam: All right, I'll go find Mom.
Matt: She's inside right now. As you walk inside, she's sitting at the table where everyone had breakfast, she's eating what was on her plate, alone. She turns around.
Sam: Mama, I'm sorry to spring all of this on you and I must go back to Whitestone with my friends, to tie up some loose ends, but I'll be back soon. Days, maybe a week.
Matt: "Be back, please."
Sam: In the meantime, though, can you think about something for me?
Matt: "Of course, what do you need?"
Sam: The charity. Papa and Sister can run it, they have smarter business acumen than I do, but the brigade, I was wondering if you wanted to do it with me. You have a taste for adventure, you could help be our manager! Tend to us when we're injured...
Matt: "Taryon, I'm far too old for adventure."
Sam: I don't think that's true!
Matt: "As an organizer?"
Sam: Yes, yes! Remember in Escape from Brave Mountain? Remember the kindly old wizard who stayed back and tended to the injured and fed them when they were sick with that mystical plague that they got? You could be that old-- Yes. Think about it. Read the book again. And when I come back, we'll talk.
Matt: "All right. But if you're going out and you're coming back, and I'm to help, bring back a better outfit."
Sam: Okay! Do you have a color in mind?
Matt: "Royal blue."
Sam: On it. I give her a big hug.
Matt: She gives you a big hug. As she hugs you, her mouth gets near your ear and she goes, "I'm glad you listened."
Sam: Me too. Mama, this is going to be fun, fun, fun!
Matt: She sniffles a bit and pushes you away. "Now go, go! Hurry back! Be safe!"
Sam: Maybe! All right, let's go.
Travis: Do we assume the form of clouds?
Marisha: Oh, no, this is probably a Tree Stride situation. Let's do that.
Taliesin: It would have been a very long cloud stride. Is it even possible to cloud stride?
Matt: It's possible, it's just going to be a long journey.
Laura: Tree Stride!
Matt: Transport Via Plants. Tree Stride is a very different spell.
Marisha: Whatever, that one. Sorry, that's the fifth level one. The sixth level teleport... transport...
Matt: I know what you mean, but I was opting for clarification. Transport Via Plants. I know what you mean.
Marisha: It is. Tree Stride just rolls off the tongue easier.
Matt: I know it does.
Taliesin: Plant Walk. Tree Trip.
Marisha: Tree Uber.
Taliesin: Treecycle. Leaft.
Liam: Sorry, pull the plug, people, wrap it up.
Matt: You find the nearest large tree and with a quick snap of your fingers, a flash of druidic energy, you watch as the tree form splits open, revealing the doorway. On the other side, the main thoroughfare of Whitestone. You step through and find yourself back in your home city.
Marisha: On the way out, I give the Sun Tree our secret handshake.
Travis: Like, a judo strike?
Sam: You just killed the tree.
Liam: Quivering Palm the Sun Tree.
Taliesin: Sun Tree is still doing it the first time, three years ago.
Marisha: It's so slow.
Matt: You knock on the Sun Tree a little bit, continue walking. First thing that catches your attention, the main square of Whitestone, largely around the Sun Tree, is fairly empty except for a few carts. It's mostly for traversing. There's a small garden that's in the early stages of being set around. As you walk into the main area, you notice that there's a lot of carts that are circling the north end of it, like a small caravan of sorts. You see a series of wagons, some horses that are tied off at a couple of hitching posts off to the side, and you see what appear to be tents and tables with various wares for sale. Fruits, vegetables, some exotic cloths and tapestries, clothing available.
Liam: Is this a festival?
Laura: Traveling salesmen?
Taliesin: My god, it's a shopping episode! I'm so excited! Just appeared out of nowhere!
Sam: Do they have something in royal blue?
Taliesin: We're going to buy so many imaginary things, Travis.
Marisha: What's happening though, really?
Taliesin: No, really, what is happening?
Matt: You don't recognize any of these people, necessarily. There's no reason, there's no calendar element to it. As you walk up, one of the nearest Pale Guard is doing a walk-through.
Taliesin: What's this all about?
Matt: "Percival. Now that the trade routes are open, we're having more caravans to and from Emon."
Marisha: It's a farmer's market!
Matt: "Essentially. We're just keeping the peace."
Taliesin: It's been several years. Why you should be even vaguely surprised by this reaction is baffling to me.
Matt: "It's baffling that you are so comfortable with it still."
Taliesin: Excellent, carry on, keep shopping.
Matt: "Of course, of course."
Taliesin: It's a farmer's market.
Marisha: Hi!
Matt: He walks off. Do you guys want to walk around?
Taliesin: There's a farmer's market!
Marisha: I need some fresh halibut right now!
Sam: Are they selling or are they just setting up?
Matt: At this time they're selling. You see some of the populace has come out. You see delicious fruits, some swamp roots, there are some herbal setups that have things that are from Stillben and things that are not indigenous to the Whitestone area.
Liam: Are there heirloom tomatoes?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: I'm going to use Luck. No I'm not, I'm kidding.
Matt: Best Luck use ever.
Taliesin: I think they're all heirloom tomatoes. There's no such thing.
Matt: You find some nice tomatoes. They're real tasty-looking tomatoes. There's one oddities shop that has small baubles and little jewelry, trinkets that they have for sale. There's a lot of dried meats. There's no fresh fish because a lot of the fishing that's done locally doesn't travel very well on caravan.
Marisha: Is there flowers? Is there a flower shop?
Matt: There is no flower shop on the caravan. There is a flower shop in Whitestone, but you don't really travel to bring flowers, they don't keep very well.
Taliesin: I assume the castle's going to be doing a run of this anyway, but I want to see the trinkets.
Matt: You walk up and you see a number of delightful things. You see a small rack of various glass vials with various-colored liquids inside. Some of them seem to be swirling. As you walk up, you see this gentleman in his early 40s, this long handlebar mustache that curls past the edges of his jaw, his hair is combed over to one side and slicked down. As you approach he's like, "Oh, hi! Yes, I've heard of you, you're Vox Machina! Well, if there's a team looking for the things I have to sell, it would be you!"
Sam: He's day-drunk.
Matt: "Now." He immediately goes into his spiel. You watch as some of the other carts nearby begin to roll their eyes a little bit. "So! Vox Machina. First off, how do I do the pleasure?"
Taliesin: Quite impressively, actually.
Matt: "Theobold Cans, by the way. That's my name. Keep it in mind. Theobold Cans."
Marisha: Like the festival. Yeah. Just go with it.
Taliesin: The Theobold festival, it's very popular.
Matt: "I have here acquired a few interesting things that may help you on your journeys. Here." He pulls out one of the vials and swirls it for a second. It has an orange-ish, yellow-ish color to it, and as it flows around its side, it has a thick movement to it, like a syrup. "This liquid, upon being imbibed, will temporarily allow you to see, read, and speak any language you like!"
Taliesin: That's very impressive.
Matt: "Isn't it, though? So I'll put that one aside as a possible, yes."
Liam: Is that for real, that one?
Sam: Oh, yes, I should Identify that. I'll Identify that.
Matt: You glance over and take a moment to concentrate. Yes, it is a Potion of Tongues.
Sam: Okay, great. Thank you for reminding me that I do that.
Matt: "Now, these, you might be interested in." He pulls out what appears to be a set of goggles with these thick crystal lenses in the front. "Now, these, these fit over your eyes, and upon activation, they have the chance of dazzling somebody and calling them a friend for some time. So. In the maybe pile? This is--" At this point, in the middle of this conversation, you specifically, Vex, you glance over your shoulder as you see the crowd parting off to the side. There's a large figure beelining in your direction.
Laura: I nudge my brother.
Liam: What the hell?
Laura: I head-nudge him.
Matt: You glance over and you see the crowd's being parted. You see a seven-foot-tall, not quite Grog-level but comparable imposing figure, coming right towards you. You see darker olive skin, appears to be a set of half-plate armor, no sleeves, just plate on the chest and on the legs. You see short hair that's buzzed on the sides with a curl of dark in the front, a Superman S curl in the front. You see a big broad smile, a tusked smile. You see orcish blood in this figure as it approaches with a big sword across the back.
Liam: I take an instinctive step forward, just a half step in front of Vex.
Travis: Maybe he'll kill us and we don't have to shop anymore.
Matt: As the figure rushes up, apparently drawn by the sound of the phrase 'Vox Machina'... (cheering)
Sam: No one can see you.
Laura: We know it's there, though!
Travis: Yeah!
Jon: There's an enchantment on it. It's actually this big.
Sam: Oh god. Oh god! Much, much bigger than Hardwick! (laughter)
Matt: So, as you have been in the process of specifically keeping an eye out for a group of individuals, specifically looking out for the name or any mention of Vox Machina, you've spent a number of hours with no luck, frustrated. But you've made some friends in talking around, and then suddenly you hear someone shout the name from a distance. You glance over and see a cluster of individuals that match the descriptions you were given. You immediately beeline up to them. You watch as two similar-looking half-elves spin and give you the evil eye.
Liam: Hey, friend.
Jon: Hi!
Liam: You look like you're headed this way, did you need something?
Jon: Yes. I'm looking for some help.
Laura: Oh, wow, yeah? What kind of help?
Liam: With you so far.
Jon: I'm with a group of these guys and we have a bit of a problem back in our homeland.
Liam: Which is where?
Jon: I have a problem with memory.
Laura: Do you remember your name?
Taliesin: The phrase 'day-drinking' has already come up today.
Jon: Well, my name is Lionel Gayheart, but most people call me Chod.
All: Chod.
Jon: Although, that was my born name, but I call myself Lionel Gayheart, it's a better name.
Laura: It's a much better name.
Liam: On the end is '-hard' or '-heart'?
Jon: Gayheart.
Liam: Heart.
Travis: People call him Chode.
Marisha: Chode.
Taliesin: Lionel.
Liam: Right.
Jon: But, so, yeah, we've been having some problems and we need some help.
Travis: What kind of problems?
Liam: Like opening a peanut butter jar, or how big?
Laura: Or, like, dragon kind of issue?
Jon: Well... More like creepy guys in a big group issue. I'm with this guy, you guys, you've heard of, he's pretty big in our parts... you've heard of the Meat Man? (gasping)
Marisha: What?!
Travis: Are you fucking shitting me?!
Laura: You!
Jon: You guys know him?
Travis: Yeah, we know him.
Jon: I thought he was just big in our parts.
Laura: Where are you from?
Taliesin: Is this what's happening right now?
Marisha: Are we all paying attention at this point?
Matt: It's hard to miss this guy show up.
Taliesin: Was trying to ignore it. Now I'm failing.
Laura: I'm going to throw something again at Sam.
Liam: Is Shorthalt around right now? Is this a prank? Is that was this is? Is this a joke?
Jon: I don't know jokes.
Liam: Insight check.
Matt: Insight check.
Liam: It's fine. No, it's not fine. That's better. 14.
Matt: He seems pretty lost on the name Shorthalt, but seems to be upfront with his intent.
Marisha: So, wait, he does know jokes, or he does know the Meat Man?
Jon: I know the Meat Man.
Marisha: But you don't know jokes?
Jon: I don't know jokes.
Ashley: How do you know the Mean Man?
Marisha: Do you know Parchment, Boulder, Shears? Never mind.
Jon: The Meat Man, he's my boss.
Travis: What? Really?
Jon: Yeah!
Laura: Wait, what does he look like? Short guy?
Jon: No, well, he's shorter than me, but, you know.
Liam: Where on yourself does he come?
Laura: Is he this size?
Sam: She's a gnome.
Jon: No, no, he's bigger than that.
Liam: Excuse me?
Marisha: What?!
Jon: It's the Meat Man, you guys seem familiar with him, you know what he looks like.
Travis: Is this the Meat Man we know?
Matt: No, not at all!
Marisha: Is he pulling a Dread Pirate Roberts?
Travis: He's not the Meat Man that we know.
Laura: Well, we don't know, maybe it is! Where are you from?
Marisha: Does he wear a beret?
Jon: I'm from an area where-- we're from the desert. It's like a desert area. We've traveled across a very, very far way. It was a long journey.
Laura: Marquet?
Marisha: Marquet?
Jon: No.
Liam: Did you cross the ocean to get here?
Jon: Yes, we crossed the ocean. We were on those wooden things that have, like--
Laura: The ships?
Jon: Yeah, ships! That's it!
Marisha: Ank'harel? Bigger than Marquet. Ank'harel?
Jon: Ank'harel!
Marisha: (gasps) We're getting closer! Oh my god!
Liam: Is your boss with you right now? Did he come with you or did he send you?
Jon: No, I'm with him, well, he said he was around here somewhere.
Liam: Shut the fuck up! He's here right now?
Jon: Why, is that bad or good?
Travis: No, real good. Real good thing.
Jon: It's a real good thing?
Laura: But will you bring us to him?
Jon: Yeah, I need your help. We need your help! I'm kind of his messenger, I was supposed to find some--
Taliesin: This is your first time being a messenger, is it?
Matt: "I don't mean any offense, here, but I was in the middle of a transaction, if you don't mind, sir?!"
Marisha: We'll take the Tongues potion. How much? Come on, give it to me.
Matt: "7,000 gold pieces."
Marisha: What?! I don't have that much!
Ashley: What was the third one, though?
Matt: "The third one?"
Laura: The one you were about to say. We were going to hear you say it before--
Taliesin: Before you were so strangely interrupted.
Ashley: This is very important, but...
Taliesin: You didn't have it, did you?
Matt: "There's a ring."
Travis: A ring?
Matt: "A ring."
Travis: What does it do?
Matt: "Allows you to move freely."
Marisha: Is it under a thousand gold?
Matt: "No!"
Marisha: Then goodbye!
Liam: We're moving, we're moving.
Matt: "Gaaah!"
Marisha: We're getting out of his store front.
Laura: Wait, Chod! Chod!
Travis: Chode.
Taliesin: Lionel.
Jon: Chod. But please call me Lionel.
Liam: Oh, you prefer Lionel!
Jon: Yes, of course!
Laura: Lionel's way better.
Jon: I probably should have told you my real name. It's Lionel.
Marisha: Can we call you Lion for short? That's fierce! I'm Keyleth.
Jon: I might get confused if you call me Lion, though, I'm just warning you ahead of time.
Marisha: Keyleth. Nice to meet you.
Taliesin: I have a feeling you're going to get confused even if we call you Lionel. It's Percival, it's a pleasure, Chod. Hello.
Jon: Hello!
Sam: Taryon Darrington!
Jon: You're a fancy lad.
Laura: Vax. Vex.
Liam: This is going to be difficult.
Laura: Just say Vex.
Jon: Vex? And your name's Vex, too?
Liam: Call her little elf girl, and you can call me little elf boy. Could we meet your boss?
Travis: Hold on, Pike had a question.
Ashley: Why is he your boss? What do you do? What kind of work are you in?
Jon: Oh, you know, we do various things. I round up-- He likes to make sure everybody's in line back in our area. Sometimes he makes me (sighs) make sure people pay up, and--
Laura: So, wait a minute, so he's like a bad guy?
Jon: No, he's a good guy!
Liam: Are you a bouncer? Is he playing music and you're his bouncer? Do you rough up people who try to cause trouble?
Jon: Well, you know, in the nicest way possible, sometimes.
Liam: Sure, that's what I do.
Ashley: Do you know someone named Kaylie?
Jon: Kaylie? No.
Laura: But do you know a girl that looks kind of like the Meat Man?
Jon: I don't talk to many girls. Oh, you're a girl! I'm sorry. Well, I'm talking to you, that's awesome!
Laura: Hey, that's great!
Jon: That might be a first. I forgot, so, I wasn't supposed to call him Meat Man. In these areas, he's known as Aes Adon. I think that's what he said.
Laura: Aes Adon? But he's actually the Meat Man.
Jon: Maybe.
Liam: So we get to meet the Meat Man?
Jon: Yeah, we need your help. But I'm just checking you guys out first because he said I'm a real good judge of character.
Laura: And what do you think? What do you judge on us?
Jon: Oh, you guys seem really nice.
Laura: You seem really great, too. You should probably take us to him, then.
Jon: Yeah! It's nice to have to, you know, go do something with people where I don't have to hurt them.
Laura: Yeah! We feel the same way sometimes.
Ashley: So he didn't send you here to hurt us?
Jon: No, no.
Ashley: Just to come.
Jon: Yeah, well, we need to enlist your help.
Marisha: Hang on a second. Will you earmuffs? He knows what earmuffs are! That's good. Anyway, why would Scanlan send a messenger? He has the gate stone! And why him? Scanlan's smarter than that, right?
Laura: Maybe Scanlan's trying to play us and he accidentally sent someone that--
Marisha: Chode?
Taliesin: Lionel!
Travis: Aes Adon. I don't think it's Scanlan.
Laura: It's got to be Scanlan.
Marisha: Look, a lot of people could go by the alter-ego Meat Man.
Laura: What other weirdo would name themselves Meat Man?
Marisha: Good point.
Taliesin: I'm also going to put out there that we all know we're going to go do this because we're desperate for anything to put off the inevitable goodbyes that we were heading towards. So let's distract ourselves for a little bit.
Liam: And, fucking Scanlan!
Taliesin: We'll see.
Marisha: Look, he's still doing it! He does follow directions well.
Laura: Lionel!
Taliesin: If I were to trick us, that's how I would trick us.
Marisha: Lionel.
Jon: What? Oh, I was having such a nice story in my head. What is it? What do you guys want?
Liam: You are very likeable. Do you have problems talking to people? To women, even? JONL No, no, I'm really good at talking to myself sometimes. That's where I get most practice.
Liam: It shows.
Taliesin: Quite a bit of practice.
Liam: Let's meet this chap!
Jon: Yeah, let's go meet him.
Matt: You watch as you're led by this lumbering oaf of a half-orc who has a spring in his step and a perpetual smile. Everyone around just can't help but watch him as he goes. He exudes this natural force of personality in spite of himself. People are enthralled or spooked or just trying to figure out what the heck this individual is that's now talking and walking with a very confused-looking Vox Machina. He leads you along to the southern side of Whitestone, talking about his tales of growing up around Ank'harel and Marquet. Any other tales he wishes to express along the way. But, eventually, leads you to one of the inns in the south side of the city. The interior is empty. There is nobody in there. It is just devoid of any people working there. You recall, because you were told to pay everybody to leave.
Jon: Yeah. But he was here, so, yeah. I don't know, you guys, like, make yourselves comfortable.
Liam: This is the craziest 48 hours, I swear to all the gods.
Jon: It's cool. Aes Adon has the best mutton. He keeps it normally-- I don't think I made the mutton leave, so you can check the drawers.
Laura: I go search the drawers.
Sam: In drawers?
Laura: Yeah! I start searching.
Sam: I'm not going to eat any mutton from drawers.
Laura: He gave me free rein, I'm searching this fucking place.
Matt: You start pulling through the drawers. There is a piece of mutton in there. You get the sense that it wasn't stored there, more than maybe it was half-eaten and left there for later.
Taliesin: 25 perception, I don't know, I'm just looking around.
Liam: I'm looking for weirdness and traps.
Matt: Okay. Make investigation checks, you guys.
Liam: 24.
Taliesin: No.
Laura: Should I be investigating, too?
Matt: Sure. So, what'd you get?
Sam: Ten.
Marisha: Not good.
Liam: 24.
Laura: 11.
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: You find the partially eaten mutton. Vax, you find the tavern has many drinks on tap, it has a number of cups. Looks to be remnants of people that were possibly eating or finishing a meal that quickly left. The coffers for the tavern are gone.
Liam: No traces of poo anywhere?
Matt: No traces of poo, no.
Laura: Scanlan! Scanlan, are you here?
Matt: You hear footsteps coming down a stairway on the far end of the tavern.
Jon: Who's Scanlan?
Sam: He's this really creepy weirdo they always talk about.
Jon: No, I don't think there's a Scanlan here, no.
Matt: You watch as an imposing figure makes his way down the stairs. As he turns around the corner, the light comes in. You see a human man, very, very tan skin. His body is thick with muscles and is imposing by just his stance. His shoulders are forward a little bit, his fists clenched to the side. You see a dark leather vest that is affixed to the torso and a hood attached that hides elements of his appearance. But you do see long stringy black hair that cascades out the front and as he turns around, you see a very craggy, pockmarked face adorned by a thick black mustache, a deep scar that sits on his face under one eye, and you see his one hand is rested on this curved, jeweled dagger that is sheathed on one side. Turns around (thudding steps) walks over to one of the far tables, pulls the chair out, spins it around, sits in it and rests on it. "Welcome, friends. You are Vox Machina, yes?"
Liam: Who's asking?
Matt: "Sit down, please. If you don't mind. You are guests of mine right now."
Sam: Is this Scanlan?
Taliesin: No.
Laura: I want to roll a perception, I want to see if it's an illusion, if it actually is Scanlan.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Jon: I told you, I don't--
Matt: "Chod! Good job." And he flicks you a gold coin.
Laura: 25.
Matt: 25.
Travis: What? Oh god! Jesus! Balls!
Sam: Whispers!
Liam: Incoming whisper!
Sam: The Scanlan Shorthalt t-shirts are available on the store right now. Travis is wearing one. You can see it maybe on your screen. He's doing a little jig! Boop boop do boop boop! Boop boop! Buy your shirts today.
Liam: The hottest penguin I ever saw.
Matt: "My name is Aes Adon."
Jon: Told you.
Matt: "I'm but a humble merchant from Ank'harel, and I'm seeking to make some contacts in this rumored emerging metropolis of Whitestone. Yes?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "Now, I have information that may be of use to you, my compatriots have told me. And, should my gatherers and whisperers be correct, in trade I would like to get some information from this one."
Taliesin: Possibly. What is it that you want to know?
Matt: "Rumors tell me of these fabled Riflemen of Whitestone."
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "While paltry mechanical imitations have occasionally come across the markets on our side of the world, I hear that you were the designer of these instruments of death."
Marisha: Oh no.
Taliesin: I am.
Matt: "Well, in the intent of expanding my influence in keeping the peace where I do business, I would like to make a trade. This important information for you to grant me access to your designs."
Taliesin: What is this information? You don't even need to tell me what it is, but that would be worth quite a lot, and what you knew would have to be worth quite a lot.
Marisha: Selling the secret recipe, man.
Matt: "Let's say that information has come to my attention regarding a hidden location on Marquet. A compatriot of mine, whom you've already met--"
Jon: (heavy, repeated sniffing)
Matt: "-- recently returned from an expedition I sent him on, where he stumbled upon a pyramid."
Travis: A pyramid?
Matt: "Yes. Does this pique your interest?"
Marisha: Oh no.
Liam: Ziggurat.
Matt: "So, this is the information I have to offer."
Marisha: Wait, he said Marquet, though.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Another one.
Laura: Did you go inside of it?
Jon: No. No.
Laura: Did you see anybody around?
Sam: Did you see anything about it?
Jon: Yeah!
Matt: "I would request you hold that information until we make a deal."
Jon: Sorry, Aes. Sorry, Aes.
Sam: No, no, you can go ahead and tell us!
Jon: No, he's my boss.
Laura: Does it count if it's a girl that he's talking to? I mean, it's not quite the same, right?
Matt: "Silence! My deal is with you, Vox Machina."
Liam: You can tell us later.
Taliesin: What is this worth?
Jon: You should listen to him.
Marisha: I guess it depends on what he thinks it's worth to us. What makes you think that we want this information so much?
Matt: "I've had a compatriot of yours stumble through my city seeking information about, apparently, something beneath your city. The whispers come to me. I saw a connection. From what I hear, you've put quite a bit of energy into this darkened orb."
Taliesin: Well, this leaves me with a bit of a conundrum. Traditionally, when people come either asking to see my designs or if we come across people who have been attempting to replicate them, we just simply have them executed on sight. Traditionally.
Matt: "I would not recommend that."
Taliesin: Well, if I were going to do it, it would have already been done, now wouldn't it?
Jon: Well, I don't know about that. Remember. Enchantment.
Matt: "Thank you, Chod."
Sam: I think that was a threat.
Taliesin: That was a very good threat!
Jon: Really? Was it?
Taliesin: It was definitely a strong six.
Liam: How'd you hear about this compatriot? How do we know you're not selling us a song? Who was this compatriot of ours?
Laura: What?
Liam: He said someone came through? He's talking about this guy?
Matt: No.
Jon: My name's Lionel, you guys.
Matt: "I did not meet this individual, but apparently they belong on the council of your country."
Marisha: What?
Liam: Little bit more, please.
Matt: "Blonde of hair. Traverses through arcane means."
Marisha: What? What'd he say?
Liam: Man or woman?
Matt: "Woman. Blonde of hair."
Marisha: Allura.
Taliesin: Well.
Marisha: What is happening?
Travis: She went to go find information about it, that's not strange.
Marisha: That's not bad, right?
Ashley: What does the Meat Man mean to you?
Matt: Leans back and you see he takes the dagger out and spins it a little bit on the fingertip. "The Meat Man is before you. I don't know where you heard this title, but--" (laughter)
Jon: I told you guys, it's Aes!
Matt: "There will be a conversation later."
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: "But that is a business alias of mine that I've had for a short time."
Ashley: You don't need to get upset with him for it.
Marisha: We had a friend who we thought it might've been him.
Travis: Keyleth, stay on task!
Marisha: Sorry.
Matt: "There is no other Meat Man."
Liam: It's kind of a sticking point for us. You're coming to us with one piece of information that we may be interested in, but you're accidentally tipping your hand towards something else that we want to know about. We know a Meat Man, and he is not you.
Ashley: Do you know... the Meat Man?
Liam: Do you know the muffin man?
Taliesin: This meeting is only happening because we were hoping to meet our Meat Man.
Matt: "If you are referring to the small one, he's been dealt with. The title is now mine."
Taliesin: Dealt with.
Liam: Roll back a step or two. Dealt with how?
Matt: "Dealt with in the way that anyone who does sloppy business: imprisoned. No longer of consequence. I was next in line."
Marisha: I'm sorry, you think that the title of Meat Man is so important that you had to kill or attack a gnome who also went by Meat Man?
Matt: "The Meat Man I take the title from was not killed by me. He was a great man. Small, but resolute. Confident. Handsome as they come. He taught me everything I know. It is a shame that he has been lost in chains beneath the city, but I am keeping up."
Laura: Such a shame that's he's been lost.
Marisha: So, you've taken on the title yourself.
Matt: "I have, in his memory."
Marisha: And what city is he in chains beneath?
Matt: "Beneath Ank'harel in its deepest prisons."
Ashley: Did he tell you to take on his name?
Matt: "No, it was bequeathed by the others left behind in his absence. They respect me, and as such, the Meat Man is I."
Liam: The name was simply meat-ed out.
Marisha: He's totally Dread Pirates Roberts-ing this shit.
Taliesin: The designs of the guns are out of the question. That doesn't mean there aren't things on the table.
Matt: "If not the designs, perhaps a few rifles and some ammunition. Something I can take back to my workers."
Marisha: Here's a question  Why did Allura come to you for information?
Matt: "Oh, she didn't come to me, but whispers came to me that she was seeking this information."
Marisha: Right. So you have ears in all the right places.
Matt: "Everywhere, my dear."
Sam: You said workers? Are you a foreman of some sort?
Matt: "You could say that. I run a business in various goods. Some legal, and I make sure that clients get them in a very forthright manner."
Taliesin: We're sadly very protective of our copyrights, and my designs are not for reproduction. Attempts at reproducing them tend to end poorly. Many have tried; most have failed. If you wanted, perhaps, a few designed, that could have been a conversation, but so far, I'm not impressed by you.
Matt: "Well then, we have nothing more to discuss, then. Come, Chod."
Jon: Okay, see you guys later!
Liam: Before you leave-- prison. What was this other Meat Man's offense? Do you know?
Jon: I don't know.
Liam: You don't know anything.
Jon: No, I don't know a lot of stuff. He doesn't tell me.
Liam: Do you like working for that guy?
Jon: Yeah, he's great, he gives me money and food and mutton.
Marisha: What if we gave you money and food and mutton?
Liam: We have mutton.
Marisha: How much money does he give you?
Jon: I like working for him. He keeps me safe.
Sam: What about this guy?
Liam: What about this guy? For Wildmount! Your brigade!
Sam: I mean...
Liam: I mean, you got to start somewhere!
Marisha: You could recruit him!
Sam: Wow. I mean--
Liam: You were rough around the edges when we met you!
Jon: I feel like I should do earmuffs right now again.
Sam: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can do better than this guy. I mean, he's really imposing and strong. Also, guys, not to split hairs here, but his boss is literally right there, listening to us. So maybe we shouldn't be talking about recruiting his employee.
Matt: "Your shiny friend has a point."
Taliesin: I'm quite surprised by the brazenness. What on earth made you think that we would sell these designs to you? You obviously are paying attention.
Matt: "As you hopefully know, the intent of negotiation is to aim high."
Taliesin: That's fair.
Matt: "Then bring your expectations. So perhaps not plans. But a few rifles, a pistol or two and some ammunition would be enough to outfit my team."
Laura: A whole team. With one pistol.
Taliesin: One pistol can do a quite a bit. One pistol can go far.
Marisha: The problem is that once he has the designs, he can replicate them.
Liam: Reverse engineer.
Laura: I don't think he would be able to reverse engineer it.
Matt: "But I have my artisans at my disposal."
Ashley: Wait, why did you think we would want this information?
Matt: "Well, if you don't, I'm happy to leave. Make some business here, some gold and then be on my way. But I was informed that you, Vox Machina, so widely respected, so strong, so rich, so involved in yourselves and your worldwide endeavors, that perhaps a little more world-saving might be up your alley, but maybe I thought you wrong."
Taliesin: How's giving you one of my weapons world-saving?
Matt: "Because the information I give you in return may help save the world."
Liam: You sound like you know about the stakes involved.
Matt: "Just what I've been whispered."
Marisha: We've met a lot of doom-seers. You sure you can stand up to them?
Matt: "I grow tired of this conversation. If this is a declination?"
Taliesin: At the very least, this is a conversation of whether or not you're ever going to do business in this city again and what that business is going to look like.
Matt: "Do not worry. You'll not see this face in your precious Whitestone again." He stands up.
Marisha: Can I do an insight check to see if I can glean any more of what he knows about this world-ending thing?
Matt: Okay. Insight check.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Sam: Whisper!
Taliesin: Earmuffs! Earmuffs!
Laura: Everybody earmuffs!
Liam: I mean, Tary, Grog is about as smart as a golden retriever and he does great.
Sam: I know! But this guy seems like he would lose a spelling bee to Grog. He's really dumb!
Laura: Well, up until a few weeks ago, Grog couldn't really spell, either.
Ashley: We could hold a spelling bee!
Sam: That's true.
Marisha: Is he still walking away?
Matt: He's going over to the half-orc. He goes, "Come on, we're leaving."
Marisha: I look at Vex and Vax and them and I say, we know him.
Laura: Give it a moment.
Marisha: There's something familiar about him.
Laura: I go and I follow him.
Matt: Okay, he walks out.
Marisha: He knows more than he's letting on.
Matt: "Come!"
Jon: All right, I'm coming. You guys should really reconsider, that's a word he just told me. I mean, he sounds scary and all, but it's really awesome stuff he has to share if you guys just shared back. Okay. See you.
Laura: I follow him right out of the room.
Matt: Both of them walk out into the daylight and you follow.
Laura: Aes.
Matt: He turns around. "Yes?"
Laura: I run up and I hug him.
Matt: Okay! Full-body?
Laura: Just a big hug! And I go down.
Matt: Okay. Immediately, instinctively, he backs up and you watch as Vex's arms pass through the legs and thighs and grab onto something smaller on the inside.
Marisha: Motherfucker!
Sam: (as Scanlan) Stop! Stop stop stop stop stop! Not here! Not here! Let's go somewhere else. Now. Let's go.
Taliesin: What?! What?! No!
Marisha: Motherfucker! Motherfucker!
Matt: And let's go ahead and take a break! (screaming)
Travis: I'll kill you! I'm going to kill you!
Marisha: Motherfucker!
Travis: How could you?
Marisha: Natural 20!
Taliesin: Oh, well done, you.
Matt: We're going to take a quick break, be right back here in a minute to pick this up. We're going to go ahead and have a Twitch giveaway in the chatroom for this awesome Wyrmwood complete system. This includes a dice tray, a dice box, a couple of fun things. It's zebrawood, which is nice. But, to win this, you have to go into the Twitch chat. The code for this is 'bardbarian.' B-A-R-D-B-A-R-I-A-N. Barbarian, but with bard-barian. Cool. So, we'll see you guys back here in a few minutes.
Travis: You! Son of a bitch!
Laura: Oh my god! [break]
Matt: Hello, guys! And welcome back to tonight's episode of Critical Role!
Travis: Son of a bitch!
Matt: (laughs) So picking up where we left off, Lionel, you just watched as this half-elf girl forcefully merged with part of your boss, and your boss starts freaking out as everyone else, you all spook in mid-daylight as you hear this familiar voice come through, saying... What did you say, again?
Sam: They were all there? I thought she just followed me.
Taliesin: We were not there.
Matt: Oh, it was just you. You guys were still inside the tavern.
Sam: Is Lionel there, though?
Matt: He left with you.
Jon: (gasps)
Sam: Lionel. Please. Go back inside.
Jon: What did you do? What did you do?
Sam: Go back inside the tavern.
Jon: Where's Aes? Where's Aes?
Sam: I am still he. Please, go back inside the tavern.
Jon: Okay.
Sam: Wait for me there.
Jon: They were nice people anyway. All right.
Matt: So, Vex, you're now there, staring at the Danny Trejo-like visage of the Meat Man.
Sam: I'll grab her by the hand and pull her into... Is there a back alley or a side place or a shadow anywhere?
Matt: There's, maybe about 15 feet off, a little alley you could duck into, yeah.
Sam: Come with me.
Laura: Of course.
Sam: When we're safely off the street, I take off the Hat of Disguise and reveal myself.
Laura: Scanlan!
Sam: Hi.
Laura: What are you doing? I mean, I knew it was you, but I thought you were going to reveal yourself to everyone.
Matt: What you do notice about Scanlan... Definitely tanner skin; that scar you saw under the eye, still there on Scanlan, and the clothing and the outfit design is much more Marquesian than you recall. Definitely more Gilmore than Scanlan.
Laura: Have you been there the whole time?
Sam: Not the whole time, but for much of it. I didn't know if I could talk to you all.
Laura: I hold his hand and just listen.
Sam: There's a lot to talk about, but not here. I have appearances to keep up, I have people depending on me who work for me.
Laura: Are you really the Meat Man there?
Sam: I am many things.
Laura: Darling.
Sam: Well, I am.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: Yes, I am, but it's not what you would think. I'm not a bad guy. This is not the place to talk about this. Listen to me. Vex, there will be a time to discuss this, but right now, I'm casting Modify Memory on you.
Laura: Don't you do it.
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Don't you do it! I push him against the wall. Can I break it? Can I break it before he does it?
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw. Actually, no, for this I'm going to have to ask you guys both to roll initiative. That's what this is going to come down to.
Marisha: Come on, Vex!
Sam: That's not good.
Taliesin: Yes!
Liam: We got an actual dice roll in the game!
Laura: 24.
Sam: Six.
Matt: Okay. So he begins, after saying this, casting the spell. What do you do?
Laura: No! I grab his hands and cover his mouth!
Matt: Okay. I'll say go ahead and make a concentration check, so make a constitution saving throw. I'm going to have you... Let's see, for this... Just roll a d20.
Sam: Constitution saving throw?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Do I add to it?
Matt: Roll a d20 and add your dex modifier to it.
Laura: Dex modifier or dex saving throw?
Matt: Dex modifier.
Taliesin: No! No!
Marisha: No!
Travis: Oh, two ones! Two ones!
Liam: Everybody speechless.
Matt: So as you go to push him into the wall, you accidentally hit between where his foot and the edge of the stone is and it causes you to stumble forward and slam into him. You fall over. You, in the process, she hits you in the side of the...
Sam: Do we accidentally kiss? Is that what's going to happen here?
Matt: Almost, but instead, you both accidentally end up elbowing the shit out of each other. She falls over, you tumble over her and become this tangled pile of soreness. The spell is lost.
Sam: Damn it!
Matt: However, you guys in the tavern, hear a (flurry of blows) against the wall on the outside.
Liam: I was starting to follow. I push the door open...
Sam: You can't tell them! You can't tell them!
Liam: Holy shit!
Taliesin: I hear that and I start walking out.
Liam: Holy shit!
Laura: Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shush!
Marisha: I bust through right behind Vax.
Matt: You guys all rush around to the alley.
Marisha: You dick!
Taliesin: Now I run.
Marisha: I knew you were familiar!
Laura: Everyone, shut up! Shut up, shut up. If you need to do something, change back, do it.
Sam: How long does the hat take?
Matt: It takes an action to do the spell.
Sam: Okay. Hat on. (whoosh)
Laura: Appearances are important.
Ashley: I make my way through. What's going on?
Marisha: No one talks about Scanlan being handsome as much as Scanlan does. That was your first giveaway, mister!
Liam: We're in an alley, though, off to the side, right?
Matt: Yeah, you're in a dark alley.
Liam: Well, then I'm giving him a big fucking hug!
Sam: It's hard to do, but yes.
Matt: So, Lionel, everyone just charges out of the tavern, and you hear a big commotion and voices on the side.
Jon: What's going on, you guys? What's happening? Can I... I think they're attacking him.
Matt: At this point, you watch as the other one is now grabbing him, merging.
Jon: Yeah, it looks like they're attacking. So I want to protect him.
Sam: As he should.
Matt: What are you going to do to protect him?
Taliesin: You can go ahead and just say.
Matt: Are you going to scare them off, are you going to attack them?
Sam: Kill them?
Jon: Yeah. No! I want to scare them away, and...
Matt: Do you have an ability that does that?
Taliesin: Or you can try and intimidate us, and say something really scary, or make some noise.
Jon: No, I want to do the Frantic Flail.
Matt: Okay, all right. So as you're hugging him, you guys watch as the half-orc turns the corner, spooks, and then, suddenly, you watch as something beneath the armor glows briefly, and he starts flapping his arms, going (honking) right at you. I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
Travis: What?
Jon: It'll be explained later.
Liam: It's not... Does it have anything to do with charm, or sleep, by any chance?
Matt: Nope.
Liam: No. Okay. All right. Oh, that's fine. 20.
Jon: Damn.
Matt: Okay, so it doesn't spook you off, it's just a little weird, as this giant man is now honking and waving and flapping his arms at you. He doesn't seem to be affected by it, he just gives you a strange look.
Jon: Yeah.
Sam: It's okay, stand down, Lionel. I can defend myself.
Jon: Because you know I'm good for... That normally works on everybody else.
Sam: You are my best man, and I appreciate your concern, but these people pose no threat to us.
Liam: That is a really good accent.
Marisha: Yeah, you're so good at that.
Jon: What are they talking about, accent?
Sam: They are beguiled by our foreign ways and they are scared of what they do not understand.
Liam: True.
Taliesin: That's true. I'm going to start walking back to the inn, and I'm going to start pouring a lot of drinks and putting them on the table.
Sam: I do have information to share with you.
Liam: We want to hear all of that information.
Jon: You still gotta give us the designs. No?
Laura: No.
Sam: I mean.
Marisha: Why did you want the designs?
Sam: Percival's guns are really cool, and I've always wanted to have some of my own, and I used all of my ammunition over the year, and now I just have this pistol. And I produce the pistol. But it has no bullets! I don't know how to make any more bullets! I need more bullets!
Marisha: Are you a mafia don, Scanlan? Are you a bad guy?
Sam: I'll take off the hat.
Matt: Okay. Lionel, you watch as your boss for the past five months shifts into this tiny little man.
Sam: Lionel, we'll talk about this later.
Jon: (screams)
Sam: I have many forms and I am-- Did you just piss your pants?
Jon: I'll go stand in the corner now.
Sam: I have many forms and I master magic that you will never understand, but know this: The money I pay you is real, so you still work for me.
Jon: That's true. Okay, I'm good.
Sam: All right. Just hang tight. I mean, you can stay, stay here. Mop yourself up or something. You're a good man. I'm sorry I do these things to you.
Jon: You're so tiny, though.
Sam: I'm strong of heart.
Jon: You haven't been that strong, but anyway.
Marisha: I pull Chod, Chard, Chode...
Jon: Lionel.
Marisha: Lionel. I pull Lionel aside. And I grab him by the face, and I say, we need you to be coherent and honest during this. And I cast Enhance Ability and give him Owl's Wisdom.
Matt: Okay.
Jon: I'll take that. I'm not going to fight back.
Marisha: It increases your wisdom. You get advantage on wisdom.
Sam: Yeah, but now I can't erase his fucking memory.
Laura: You've just been going crazy with that Modify Memory, haven't you?
Sam: Hey, man, it's my bag of tricks, all right?
Liam: So are we going to do this in an alleyway, or are we going to go get a drink, and you tell us where the fuck you've been?
Laura: Should we go inside? It's an empty fucking bar.
Sam: Okay. Let's go back inside the tavern, but just know this. He doesn't drink, all right?
Laura: Sure.
Liam: Whatever. Come on. We want to hear what you've been doing for a year. Come on!
Sam: All right.
Jon: Thank you for remembering.
Sam: You're my guy.
Matt: You guys make your way back into the tavern.
Taliesin: It is set up.
Matt: You now have the delightful experience of roleplaying two characters, Sam, in the same scene.
Liam: Boy, that's got to suck.
Matt: Welcome to my world.
Jon: I can kill Taryon.
Sam: I have to go check on Doty! Look at the time! Good-bye!
Laura: Look, this is that guy we were telling you about for so long.
Sam: The skeevy asshole that you always talk about?
Taliesin: Yes, the skeevy asshole, that would be the one.
Sam: He's pretty handsome.
Taliesin: You would say that, wouldn't you?
Ashley: I think I'll go with you, Tary.
Laura: Pike...
Ashley: It's fine.
Travis: Yeah. I'll go, too.
Sam: What? All right.
Taliesin: I want to listen.
Liam: I'm curious. Talk to us, man.
Sam: All right.
Laura: Talk to them. Don't let them leave.
Sam: You all can stay. It's been a while.
Travis: It has.
Sam: Yes. Yes, just stay. It's fine.
Marisha: Is it, though, Scanlan?
Taliesin: What would you have done if I had just decided to open fire on you?
Laura: I would've stopped you, darling. I knew it was him right away.
Sam: I would've done what Scanlan would always do. I would've won and killed you. I mean, I'm super powerful and awesome.
Taliesin: Yes. But really. This was not a good plan.
Marisha: Scanlan, there are some hurt feelings in this room, and it might be time to address those.
Sam: I know. I know. But for now, let's just catch up. What have you guys been up to for the last year?
Liam: No, no, no. After you, dear. After you.
Marisha: I'm chief of my people!
Sam: Oh, you did your Aramente!
Marisha: I did! I wish you were there! I mentioned you and everything in my speech.
Sam: You did?
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: That sounds nice.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: Anybody else ascend to new heights? No?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Yes?
Taliesin: Yes. None of your business at the moment. Tell us your business.
Liam: Where have you been?
Sam: I went traveling a bit. I did what gnomes do, I went into the forest with Kaylie.
Ashley: Oh, is that what gnomes do? They go into the forest? I'm so sorry, please continue.
Sam: Forest gnomes do. And we talked, and we sang songs, and we camped, not in the mansion, just in a tent. We had some good times and bad times together, and eventually we found our way to Ank'harel, and some stuff happened, yadda yadda, and I'm here now, you know?
Laura: I try to pass my hand through Lionel's stomach to see if he's actually Kaylie.
Sam: Is he?
Jon: You feel tons of abs. It bounces off and hits you in the face with your own hand.
Taliesin: I was with you on that one.
Laura: Serious, serious abs.
Liam: Where's Kaylie now?
Sam: She's with me, yeah? No, did we leave her back there?
Matt: Kaylie's in Ank'harel. Essentially, you...
Sam: She is... It's complicated, but right now, she is the Meat Man. She is back in Ank'harel, taking on the business while I'm off here.
Liam: How are you two doing?
Sam: Pretty good. We're a good team. Yeah.
Marisha: Does she like you now?
Sam: 'Like' is a strong word.
Taliesin: It's really not.
Jon: 'Love' is a stronger word. That's why people use 'like'.
Liam: There's that Owl's Wisdom right there.
Jon: Whoa. What just happened?
Taliesin: You have advantage on wisdom saving throws.
Jon: It's weird. It's new to me.
Sam: We're fine, she and I. We're a team, and she's taught me some stuff, and I've taught her some stuff, and we operate together.
Marisha: And what kind of operation do you operate?
Sam: We went to Ank'harel to get a little simple revenge, and it turned into something more than that, and I didn't mean to, but I guess I became one of the three largest crime bosses in Ank'harel.
Liam: In a year.
Sam: Eight months, really. We traveled around close to here. We were only 20 miles away for most of the first couple months, and then it took us time to get there. Don't worry, though, I'm not a bad guy. I just sell things, trinkets, furniture, art pieces, antiquities, that sort of thing.
Liam: Nothing dangerous?
Sam: Nothing dangerous. All fake.
Marisha: And to whom do you sell these things?
Sam: Rat bastards. People who deserve it. People with money to burn, and people who have done wrong in their lives. I take some back.
Liam: Why now? Why have you come back? Not that I'm not overjoyed to see you, but I'm curious.
Sam: I had information, and you had to know it. It's important. We found another one. Lionel did. The ziggurat.
Laura: Did you go inside?
Jon: Another? You didn't tell me there was more!
Sam: No, no, I mean, there's the one you found, and then there's one here.
Jon: (gasps)
Sam: Yes. Will you tell them what you saw?
Jon: Well, me and my buddies, we went inside this...
Sam: Can I clarify, these are all hired men of mine. They're not his buddies. I pay them all.
Liam: Could be both.
Sam: I mean, maybe they're friends now, but, okay.
Jon: Well, no, they're dead now.
Sam: That's fair.
Jon: I guess, if they weren't buddies, then I shouldn't feel bad anymore. The bad feelings will go away. We went inside the mountain, following some people that... Do I call you Aes, or?
Sam: That's fine.
Jon: Okay. Aes here told us to follow some people.
Sam: I had learned of someone new coming into town and stealing some magical artifacts and leaving some dead bodies, and it wasn't my organization, and it wasn't any of the other two leading crime organizations, I found out through my whispers. So it was someone new, and I wanted to find out who it was, so I sent Lionel, my best man, and his buddies to investigate.
Taliesin: There was a comma there.
Jon: So, yeah, and he knew he could trust us because we're awesome. We were going to go get some information. So we followed them into this big tunnel that goes into the mountain. We had to go through, it took a long time and we had to fight a lot of cool stuff along the way, but nothing important to this.
Sam: I mean, all the details are good, just, when you tell a story, lots of details.
Jon: Lots of details?
Sam: Yeah, yeah, paints a picture.
Jon: Well, I've never been good at stories.
Marisha: You're doing great.
Jon: But when we got to the middle, we found a big giant pyramid. Or a ziggy-star-- what?
Sam: Ziggy stardust.
Jon: Is that what you call it?
Sam: Ziggurat.
Liam: Pyramid's good. We're with you, yeah.
Jon: We found a pyramid, and we saw all these guys hanging around it, and right at the top of the pyramid was this big black ball. It looked like a pearl, but it was giant. It was at the top of the pyramid, and these guys, wearing these really cool but scary hoods and robes, they were throwing stuff on the black orb, and it was breaking and absorbing the stuff. And then this one guy--
Marisha: What were they throwing in?
Jon: Oh, it was anything. Some of them threw treasure, some of them threw some real animals. Alive.
Sam: And a person.
Jon: I was getting to that!
Sam: Sorry, sorry, I don't want to cut you off. Keep going. Keep going.
Jon: And then one of the guys actually jumped in and it absorbed him.
Laura: Did it look like he was in pain?
Jon: No, it just went (sucking sound). And he was gone. And so I had to get out of there. By then, my buddies, they were dead and taken away. So I was the only lone survivor, and that's why you can count on me the most. He knew I would survive. Is that why you sent them? Because you knew only I would survive?
Sam: I assumed that... Yes?
Jon: See, I'm the best. So that's what I saw.
Laura: Was it a lot of guys?
Jon: There was a whole bunch of these guys in robes. It was really creepy.
Sam: And dark hoods, executioner-style.
Jon: Yes, matching robes, and I got a really creepy feeling when I saw it, besides being in the middle of a mountain.
Liam: Roughly how many?
Jon: Oh, I don't know. I mean, it was dark.
Liam: More than us?
Jon: More than you.
Matt: When you were there, it would've been about 12 or 13 of them there.
Taliesin: That's a lot of matching robes.
Liam: And they all looked the same? Nobody looked a little more important than the others?
Jon: I couldn't see their faces, I couldn't see. They were all covered in these robes. It felt like...
Laura: How long ago was this?
Jon: This was a couple months ago. I mean, you know, I lost track of time when we were on the ship.
Sam: It's a couple weeks. (laughter)
Jon: I was asleep for most of the ship ride. I was pretty sick.
Laura: I get sick, too. I understand.
Sam: It was hard to tell. His face is always green, so we couldn't really tell.
Jon: You guys were good. You guys gave me all the leftover stew that you had.
Laura: So, wait, and then you saw Allura there? That's bullshit?
Matt: No, that was all bullshit.
Sam: No, I'm sorry. I lied to you.
Laura: Oh. Oh, you suddenly lied to us. Wow, I feel so shocked.
Sam: I didn't know. Listen, I wanted to tell you this information, but I didn't know how to do so. I still don't know what's going to happen. You all might draw your knives and kill me right now, I just wanted to get this information...
Jon: No, they won't kill you. I promise.
Sam: Thank you.
Liam: No one wants to kill you.
Ashley: Well, that's debatable.
Taliesin: You tried to get me to give you my gun designs?
Sam: Just some ammo.
Taliesin: For what?
Sam: For my gun that I have.
Taliesin: You have a gun?
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: He stole it from you.
Laura: Remember?
Marisha: No, you gave it to him!
Taliesin: No, I didn't give it to him.
Jon: Do you want it back?
Sam: No, please don't give it back.
Liam: What's your best-case scenario here? What did you hope would happen? You'd come and tell us these things and then what happens next?
Sam: You would go investigate.
Liam: With you?
Sam: No. You would go investigate and I would go back to my job.
Marisha: So you're just here to be an errand boy. That's all you want. To help us out.
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: You traveled to a separate hemisphere to be a messenger.
Jon: It was only a couple weeks.
Ashley: Can I insight-check him?
Matt: Sure.
Ashley: 23.
Sam: 37.
Liam: He's back.
Matt: Hard to read.
Sam: I've thought about you all a lot, during this year, and I owe you all an apology for leaving you, and I don't know what I'll ever do to make it up to you.
Laura: We deserved it.
Sam: No, you didn't.
Taliesin: No, we didn't.
Sam: There was a night. There was a night early on, a few weeks after I left you. It was just me and Kaylie by a campfire, and she was asking me about myself and my life, and she has this thing. I don't know if it's a spell or a special ability, but she can always tell when I'm lying. She's the only one. And I was trying to spin some sort of bullshit to her about my past, and she called me on it, and said, the truth. Let me hear it. And I told her everything. I told her about all the lives I had ruined, and about the women, and about all the other Kaylies out there that I know of, and the ones that I can only assume exist. And everything. And she spat at me, and she gave me this scar with her knife, and she left. And I thought that was it. I had ruined it. But before dawn, she came back, and she unrolled her bedding, and she went to sleep, and woke up the next morning, and said, what's for breakfast, Dad? And I realized that I've been wrong, that you don't leave your shit behind and keep going. You take it with you, and the ones you surround yourself with better get used to the smell. And she stayed with me despite all my flaws. And when I left you all, it was the first time that I had realized that you were all really flawed people. Really flawed people. And I left. And I did not come back. And I was wrong, because family sticks around even if you kind of hate the other person. And I didn't. I betrayed you. And I've lived with that shame for a year.
Liam: Are you happier now?
Sam: Well, I have a purpose. I have a job. People depend on me. Strong people, like this guy. That's you.
Jon: Me?
Sam: Yeah. And smart people, and Kaylie. And I'm a pretty big shot.
Jon: You're not so big anymore.
Sam: Well, it's a metaphor.
Laura: You always were.
Liam: That doesn't sound too bad to me.
Marisha: Did you not feel like you had a purpose when you were with Vox Machina? I'm not judging you in the moment.
Sam: I knew I was part of something, but I always thought I was... I've been a storyteller, but I didn't think I was part of the story. And for the last year I've been the story, and it's felt good. But I'm back, and I've given you the information, and you can tell me what you'd like me to do next.
Marisha: You know, there is a point that we are all family, but we are also all friends, and there is that old saying, be careful of the friends that drag you down. Maybe we were dragging you down.
Taliesin: I'm going to put some pistol shot in a small bag. What's Kaylie's mother's name? What is it? I toss it to him. Dick. And I leave. For the record, it's Sybil.
Ashley: I think I hear something. Do you hear that? It sounds like small little violins that I hear. Do you hear that?
Travis: Yeah.
Jon: I don't hear anything. (laughter)
Ashley: I forgot I had to talk to Percy about something. Bye. Good to see you.
Marisha: You know, you've broken a lot of hearts, Scanlan. I think you're still a heartbreaker. And I leave with them.
Laura: I think they'll come around.
Sam: I doubt it.
Liam: No, I think she's right.
Laura: I think more than anything they've just missed you, darling.
Liam: Can I tell you a secret? All this last year, I've known we would see you again.
Laura: He's full of shit. He totally said that you were never coming back. I knew.
Liam: It's good to see you again.
Sam: It's good to see you all. I don't really know what to do now. I have... I really don't know what to do now. And that's a new feeling for me. I have information. We should travel back to Ank'harel so I can show you.
Laura: Of course.
Sam: And maybe then you all can decide what to do. Whether to part ways, as friends or enemies. But I can help you. I know people there, and I can get you safe passage, fine accommodations, the best food, even some realistic-looking antiques.
Laura: Ooh. I like it.
Sam: Grog?
Travis: I leave.
Liam: Give him time.
Laura: Scanlan. I think you need to talk to them. Pike didn't get to say a word to you when you left. Grog was...
Liam: Grog.
Laura: Grog was hurt.
Sam: All right. Should I go now? I should give them some time.
Laura: Maybe a little bit of breathing room, and then, yeah.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: Little steps.
Sam: Lionel. Thanks for sitting through all this. I really appreciate it.
Jon: I was just telling stories in my head again.
Sam: Oh, really? The good ones or the bad ones?
Jon: The bad ones. They just pop in there.
Sam: I'm sorry. I know you've had a bit of a rough life.
Jon: Are you wanting me to talk about my life?
Sam: No, no, no, you don't have to. We're already weird right now, so I'm cool.
Marisha: Can we go to sleep now?
Matt: Okay.
Sam: It's eight AM.
Marisha: Everyone's emotionally tired.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: So are we going to see an orb in the morning?
Matt: It's midday at this point, so you guys all go to your separate rooms and take time to yourselves independently, converse amongst individually.
Taliesin: Pike, Grog, do you want a drink?
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah.
Liam: Oh, I was just about to ask you the same thing.
Laura: Oh. Well, I mean, yeah.
Taliesin: Grog, I want to go find that orb.
Marisha: What? The orb in Ank'harel? Are we all talking over our headpieces? I think that's what we're doing.
Laura: I'm sure Scanlan still has his. He can probably hear us talking right now.
Ashley: Scanlan, can you hear me now? I take out my earpiece.
Marisha: He's a dick, he can hear us. I know the range of these things.
Travis: Yeah, I take off my earpiece, too.
Taliesin: I kind of want to go work the blood out, Scanlan or not. I like Lionel. He's funny.
Liam: We're all agreed on that, at least.
Marisha: Are we supposed to be angry, or sad, or happy? I don't know what all these feelings are all at once.
Taliesin: You can have them all at once.
Marisha: Can I?
Taliesin: Yes. They're not exclusive.
Travis: Percy. Where would someone like him stay in Whitestone?
Sam: Where are you guys right now, by the way?
Taliesin: We just went to the closest pub.
Sam: Is Lionel with them?
Matt: Lionel's left behind with you unless you gave him instructions otherwise. He's your bodyguard.
Sam: Would you like to go with them or stay with me in my sad room?
Jon: I'll go with them. (laughter)
Matt: You guys sit down, you get your drinks, and right as you're about to have this conversation, Lionel just moseys up to the table. The barmaid's like, "Um..."
Taliesin: He learned a lot about his employer today, I have no problem with him being here.
Marisha: Yeah, he needs a stiff drink.
Matt: "Can I get you some wine, ale, beer? What would you like?"
Taliesin: Fruit juice, maybe?
Jon: Do you have chocolate milk?
Taliesin: We do have hot cocoa.
Matt: "I'll see what I can do." She walks away.
Taliesin: Hot cocoa is doable. We've done hot cocoa before.
Marisha: And security blankets.
Taliesin: It's the orange blanket wrap. Grog.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Taliesin: What do you think?
Travis: Lionel. Real strong, are you?
Jon: I'm really strong. I don't know a lot of things, but I think I know that.
Travis: Aes. Does he depend on you?
Jon: He does.
Travis: How long have you known him?
Jon: Probably about... Well, I'm not really good with years, or days or months, but probably a lot of days. Maybe a year.
Travis: How strong do you think you are?
Jon: The other day I tried to high-five a--
Travis: I reach across the table and I just punch him in the face.
Matt: All right. Roll for an attack.
Liam: I love the malice radiating this way, and the absolute lack of recognition.
Marisha: It stops here. It stops at the camera line.
Travis: 24.
Matt: So what's your armor class?
Jon: 18.
Matt: 18. Go ahead and roll, for this here, I'd say a d4. Why not? Because you guys are pretty beefy. A d4 and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Nine. Ten, sorry.
Matt: He comes across and cold-cocks you in the chin. You take ten points of damage from a single punch. You feel a looseness to one of your back teeth, and the white hits you, and your vision clears for a second, and you look over and you see the beefy, gray-skinned goliath, his fist still extended as he pulls it back, staring right at you.
Jon: Whoa, that hurt!
Travis: Yeah. This bar, there's a lot more where that came from. All you can eat, yeah.
Jon: Show me! That was awesome!
Travis: Rage.
Laura: Oh no! Oh no.
Travis: Total rage.
Liam: We're not here.
Laura: Yes, we are.
Liam: I thought you and I-- I asked...
Laura: I thought we all said we went.
Liam: They all left, we were behind. This is the problem when everybody's thoughts are in different heads.
Matt: Do you guys want to be in the same bar or not, that's my question right now.
Laura: We don't have to be. Okay, then no. We're not there, then.
Matt: Okay, so you're not there. This is happening between you guys. Grog goes into a rage.
Travis: Are we at a bar? At a table?
Matt: You guys are in a tavern. There's a few people, and as soon as that punch happened, a few people were like, "Ooh!" in the background, and as soon as you stand up and go into a rage, people begin to back out of the way. Tables are being pushed to the side.
Taliesin: I'm pulling gold out to pay for this.
Jon: I think it's awesome. I'm like, I want to fight back. But not-- it's play for me, now.
Matt: So then, I want you guys both to roll initiative.
Marisha: Grog, don't kill him! Grog, don't kill him!
Jon: What's my initiative? Oh, plus one. So what is that, a six? That's a nine. So ten?
Taliesin: Yep.
Jon: Ten.
Travis: 14.
Matt: All right, so as you get up, you're like "All right!" And this guy-- you're used to being the biggest guy in the room. He's a little bigger than you.
Sam: I, Taryon Darrington, rolled a 14.
Jon: You're not here.
Sam: I'm with you guys.
Matt: He did come with them, yeah.
Jon: I thought you said-- Oh, Taryon.
Sam: I'm Taryon Darrington. I stand up and I say, I've seen this before. He will attack brutally. Drink this. And I shove a Swift Step draught in his mouth. You can run 80 feet now every turn.
Matt: All right, so you can move pretty fast if you want to.
Marisha: Keyleth is just watching intently, and more importantly watching Grog, making sure he doesn't actually beat him to death. We'll stop this if it gets bad.
Ashley: I take a seat on a bar stool and just start drinking.
Taliesin: Yeah, we're sitting next to you.
Matt: As you're preparing, Grog, this guy who's a little larger than you are, and as soon as he stands up you're like, "Oh!" And he's quicker than you thought. Grog, what are you gonna do?
Travis: Are we at a table or the bar?
Matt: You are, yeah.
Travis: At a table or at the bar?
Matt: Oh, you were at a table within the bar.
Travis: Magnificent. I flip up the table in my hands and I smash it over his head.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Taliesin: That doesn't belong to you. That's coming out of my coffer.
Travis: 25.
Matt: 25, okay. That hits. Go ahead and roll another d4.
Jon: So I'm quick but not that quick.
Travis: 12.
Matt: 12 points of bludgeoning damage to you as he smashes the table over your head. Lionel, the wood splinters and breaks around you, and you hear the crack of the broken wood, and you can feel the splinters shred across the edge of your shoulders, causing the burst of warmth and blood begin to flow to the top of your shoulders, and you're like, "Oh, this is exhilarating." All right. That's your turn? All right, Lionel, you're up.
Jon: Okay! To fight?
Taliesin: You can do anything you like.
Jon: Yeah, I definitely want to fight back because this is fun.
Taliesin: Cool. Here to help.
Matt: It's a bonus action to rage if you want.
Jon: Yeah, but I like the-- What?
Matt: It's a bonus action to rage, if you want to do that.
Jon: Yeah, I saw his rage, and I-- no, I'm going to rage, because I want to mimic. Like, hey, I can rage, too! Watch this! So do I roll that?
Matt: No, no. You're now raging, so now your muscles swell, the veins bulge out, with this big grin on his mouth. When Grog's raging, Grog's angry rage. He's happy rage.
Jon: Oh, check it out! You can see my veins go (jingling).
Matt: So what do you want to do for your turn?
Jon: I want to go and do... So I run up to him, and I go to do the really cool thing I heard in a cool story where I twist up my fist and I go (whoosh) (pow). I've always wanted to try this, and this looks like a better time than ever to try it out.
Matt: So, roll for an attack and it's plus ten. We'll say plus ten for this.
Jon: 17.
Matt: What's your AC? 17? Go ahead and roll a d4 and add your strength modifier, which I think is a plus five.
Jon: And I am looking for what?
Taliesin: And you add five for your strength, so you got--
Jon: So, eight.
Matt: So, eight points of bludgeoning damage. You take four, Grog.
Sam: Plus three damage.
Matt: Oh, plus three damage on top of that! So, eight, so 11. Sorry, you take five.
Sam: He takes half-damage. But you did great.
Matt: You're both raging. You're both taking the lesser damage of each hit.
Sam: You get two attacks, but you're raging, so you get a third attack?
Matt: No, Grog has that ability. He has a different-- he's not a frenzy barbarian.
Sam: But he does get two attacks.
Matt: He does get two attacks. So you get to attack again.
Jon: This time, I run around him because I'm super quick and like using this new speed I've never experienced. And I jump on his back from around and I try to choke him.
Taliesin: Grapple.
Matt: Go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Taliesin: That plus ten.
Jon: 23.
Matt: You go ahead and roll an athletics or acrobatics check to resist it.
Sam: Oh, shit, his is huge.
Travis: That's not great. That's a 14.
Matt: 14. You leap up behind him and put your arm up under. His jaw's like concrete, but you still find the one soft part and jam your bulging forearm up into that space and you feel the windpipe (choke) close and clench in.
Travis: (choking sounds)
Matt: And your really, really fast feet are now dangling about two inches off the ground as you're on his back right now. That's the end of your turn. You're currently grappled, Grog, what are you going to do?
Travis: (choking sounds) I'm going to put it in reverse straight towards the wall.
Matt: Go ahead and roll. Are you just going to stay holding on as you're doing it?
Jon: Yeah. Yeah. Because this is the first piggyback he's ever had.
Matt: It's kind of fun for a second before you hit the wood. Wham! I'll say, go ahead and roll a strength saving throw to see if you can maintain the hold after the slam.
Jon: 18.
Matt: 18. Okay, I'd say that's enough for the strength of the hold. So he keeps holding on after the slam in the back. Anything else you're going to do with your turn?
Travis: My action. I take my elbow, raise it up and drive it into his ribs.
Matt: Okay, roll for an attack.
Travis: Yeah, that's a 28.
Matt: Yeah, so 1d4.
Sam: Now he has to roll damage.
Travis: Ten.
Matt: So, ten damage halved to five and you have an ability as reaction, if you remember. It's in your totem abilities that you can use as a reaction.
Jon: Oh! Off a Duck's Back!
Marisha: Off a Duck's Back?!
Jon: The duck is my animal totem, you guys. I can explain that later.
Matt: So, as you go to slam him with your elbow, you hit, but you feel like your elbow slips off his body and doesn't quite do the damage you hoped it would. So you take two points of damage.
Jon: Sweet!
Taliesin: Covered in duck butter.
Liam: It's the saxophone player from Lost Boys greased up!
Travis: For my second attack, can I throw my head back in a headbutt?
Matt: Go for it, roll for an attack.
Travis: Yeah, 23.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll 1d4 plus strength.
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. So you take five points of bludgeoning damage, because you can only use that reaction once per round.
Jon: I took five points.
Matt: You have to use an action to try and break free of a grapple. So you took five, yeah. So now it's back to your turn. He slammed you into the wall, he's elbowed you twice in the stomach, you've resisted some of it, you're still holding him there.
Jon: Okay.
Matt: So if you wanted to, because of one of the feats you have, you could turn that into a pin if you wanted to.
Jon: One of the feats I have?
Matt: Yeah, it's on the bottom.
Jon: Now this is turning into a wrestling match, I like that.
Matt: Or you could just keep whaling on him.
Jon: I want to take him out. Not kill. He's just having fun.
Marisha: It's going down in the Whole Foods parking lot!
Jon: So I'm still hanging on him.
Matt: Yeah, you're holding onto him by throat, he slammed you against the wall, he's elbowed you in the stomach twice.
Jon: I'm, again, having fun, superspeed. I'm going to, while holding onto him, crawl up his back and jump over and try to land and try to do the move where I do that and throw him.
All: Yeah!
Jon: Yeah, against one of the pillars in the bar, away from the innocent people.
Matt: Make an athletics check. And you have advantage on this because you're raging, so you roll twice and take the higher of the two.
Jon: Oh, it's just the best?
Taliesin: Roll again. Yeah, roll again, best of two. Better!
Jon: 22.
Matt: Okay, 22. Grog, I'm going to say, because you're grappled, go ahead and roll an athletics check with disadvantage.
Travis: You got it.
Matt: It should be one roll, because you're raging, you also get advantage on it, technically.
Travis: Just one roll? 24.
Matt: 24. You reach off, you leap over and you grab him and you go to pull and it's like pulling a pillar. Not budging. You can try again if you want to, or do something else.
Marisha: Oh, because he has a second...
Matt: He has a second attack, yeah.
Jon: I tried to jump over, so now I'm just-- Actually, I did the flip but I didn't pull him, so now I'm just hanging on the front of him. I'm still holding on, but now I'm in front of him, dangling.
Matt: He's stand-spooning you.
Travis: What is this?
Jon: Yeah, so now I--
Sam: Reverse pile-drive.
Taliesin: Go for it! Don't think, act!
Jon: Well, I want to start--
Marisha: What would Chode do?
Jon: Well, this is play for him, so I don't know, this is not an attack, I just want to tickle him. Kind of grinding on him. In a way, trying to use that to his advantage to make him uncomfortable.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Jon: That's an intimidation, okay.
Matt: Against Grog? Yeah.
Jon: 27.
Taliesin: Oh! Grog's ticklish!
Matt: Grog, make a wisdom saving throw.
Travis: Minus two. Four.
Jon: You guys get what I'm doing.
Matt: I'm going to say, for the purposes of this, it catches you so off-guard and it's so unexpected that you're stunned for the next round.
All: Oh!
Matt: As you do that, you see him walk up and he starts pushing you away.
Jon: Does he let go? I can let go now.
Matt: You can let go, yeah. He's like, "Uh, uh!" You get a full other turn, what are you going to do?
Jon: Can I run back, and then do a (yelling) and then I just dive in with the biggest punch I can.
Matt: Go for it. You back away, you leap--
Jon: Yeah, everything I can put into it, all force, because I still want to get a good punch in there.
Matt: Yeah, go ahead and roll for an attack. If you want it, you can make it reckless.
Jon: Yeah, he's definitely reckless.
Matt: So roll twice and take the higher on each attack.
Jon: 15. What is that?
Taliesin: That's a 20.
Sam: Oh, that crits!
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d4.
Taliesin: He's also got Brutal Critical, so that adds 2d6 to that, but we'll get to that.
Matt: Technically, it would add a d4, because he's not using his sword. So, roll that twice and then add your strength.
Jon: 15.
Sam: But he's raging, so another three.
Jon: 16.
Matt: 16 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Grog. That's eight.
Travis: Eight, got it.
Laura: How are you doing, Grog? Are you still okay? Are you bloodied yet?
Sam: He's down 22 hit points.
Matt: As your first attack, you run in. Right as soon as he looks up, you're smiling as you come at him. You watch as the beard shakes in opposition of the jaw quiver and you feel and can taste the iron welling up in the back of your tongue as you may have bitten off a small piece of the back of your tongue. As soon as you land from that punch, he looks a little stunned. You have a second attack if you want to.
Jon: I'm going to do my Wave Kick. That's just something he's always wanted to try, he doesn't know if it'll work. It's where he does a full-body-- and then his foot kicks him right in the groin.
Matt: Awesome. You've practiced this alone many times, this is your first chance to actually use it. So go ahead and make an attack for your Wave Kick.
Jon: Right in the crotch.
Liam: Lionel, with his nunchucks, in the family den.
Matt: Basically.
Jon: So just an attack?
Matt: Well, it's reckless, so you roll twice, take the higher.
Taliesin: Roll again. Better.
Jon: 17.
Matt: So go ahead and roll a d4 and add your damage.
Jon: One.
Sam: Plus five is six?
Taliesin: No, you only roll the d4 once.
Sam: So one plus five plus three.
Matt: Okay, so nine. You take four points of bludgeoning damage, Grog, and you just took a swift Wave Kick to the groin, as he kind of (whack). Little snap right to the nuts, so it's not like an immediate pain, it's the tap. The dull nausea pain, and he seems to shake a little from the impact as he kinda grins and glares at you with his angry eyes. Well done. Grog?
Ashley: (deadpan) Grog, stop, no, don't kill him.
Travis: I'm so confused. I've never had another male do that to my body. He shimmied on me. And then he punched me. And then he kicked me in the jellies. I turn around and I leave. (gasping)
Matt: He just walked away.
Sam: It's over?
Jon: That was fun, you guys. That was fun.
Taliesin: Pike, do you want to go deal with that?
Jon: I was just having fun. Is he all right?
Taliesin: He'll be fine.
Marisha: I've never seen Grog walk away from a fight. He's not fine. What are you talking about?
Taliesin: I didn't say he's fine, I said he will be fine.
Sam: I'm pretty sure this makes you a member of Vox Machina now.
Taliesin: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Sam: Well, that's what happened to me, they attacked me and then I was in.
Taliesin: There was chocolate milk on the way.
Matt: You see the woman in the back is carrying this mug and is like, "Right."
Sam: He'll need a straw.
Matt: "Here's your chocolate milk."
Jon: Anybody else want to fight?
Ashley: I punch him across the face. (cheering)
Matt: You get the chocolate milk to your mouth, before (impact sound) knocks it right out of your hand.
Taliesin: Were you standing on the table when this happened? I'm so excited.
Matt: And you watch, the fist comes across, and the gnome that is in an arc of movement lands on her feet. You look down and you can see the white-haired, fully armored gnome there with her big gauntlets is now there below you, kind of grinning and growling.
Marisha: That was good chocolate milk!
Taliesin: We'll have another.
Jon: I'm bummed about the chocolate. You guys have any more chocolate milk?
Matt: "Yeah."
Taliesin: Another round.
Matt: "Okay." She wanders off.
Marisha: Chocolate's expensive, here.
Jon: That was awesome.
Taliesin: She can take it.
Ashley: I'm pretty awesome. I finish my ale, flick a money on the bar, and leave. Oh shit, I don't have any money, because I gave it all away. Tary, Tary?
Taliesin: I'm covering, I'm covering.
Sam: Thank you, because I don't have much.
Matt: She goes, "And the table?"
Taliesin: Sorry. There's a pile that's been growing on the table of gold for the furniture.
Matt: "All right, thank you." Brings you another round of chocolate milk.
Jon: Is anybody going to hit me before I drink this?
Taliesin: No, I think that's done now.
Jon: I'm not, like, I'm not checking. It's fine if you do. Okay.
Marisha: Just drink it first.
Taliesin: I think it's chocolate milk time.
Jon: Mmm.
Taliesin: Maybe I drink too much. I'm not sure. This is really nice.
Jon: I just want to say, you guys, this is the most fun I've had in a long time. Aes, or you guys call him Scanlan?
Taliesin: Aes is fine, Aes is fine.
Jon: He's all I've known for the past year, you know? He took me in when, you know, things weren't going too well for me. And it's been great. He had a really cool speech about family, I've never heard him talk like that. It was kind of weird, because he's always been this really tough guy, but I don't know if you guys realize that I just found out he lied to me for a year.
Taliesin: No, we know. It's why we took you to a bar. He's lied to us, too.
Jon: Well, I know that he lied to you, and I just found out that he lied to me, but it's okay.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Jon: Because I realise that he was always there, and even though I worked for him, and, you know, he told me what to do, and would bark orders, he always had my back, and he was the only one who took care of me. So I think you guys should, like, be nice to him. Or--
Taliesin: That's the trouble, he does always have your back, until he doesn't.
Marisha: The idiot has a point.
Sam: Well, let's not call names.
Jon: What's an idiot?
Marisha: Oh hey, Tary.
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: You're still here.
Sam: Yes. I am.
Taliesin: I get confused because of the cup.
Marisha: I know.
Sam: Taryon Darrington, pleased to make your acquaintance. Hi. I'm going to be leaving soon. (laughter)
Jon: Can I kick you in the nuts?
Sam: Uh, please don't. I'm very dainty.
Jon: Okay.
Taliesin: Extremely dainty.
Jon: You guys seem like you all enjoy that kind of stuff, it's awesome.
Taliesin: Well, you've met the couple that do.
Marisha: You're not wrong.
Marisha: Only Scanlan can make Vox Machina speechless. It's happened a few times tonight. Did you notice that?
Taliesin: Hadn't.
Marisha: I did.
Taliesin: I'm really angry.
Marisha: What do we do?
Taliesin: I want to go see that bloody orb.
Marisha: Hey, Chode?
Jon: Mm?
Taliesin: Lionel.
Marisha: Sorry.
Taliesin: You're so good about this normally.
Jon: It's all right. At least you guys are remembering one of my names. I had to come up with a couple-- I used to have ten, just to make it easier for people to even call me a name.
Taliesin: I have quite a few names myself.
Marisha: Chard? Where did you come from before you met Scanlan?
Jon: Well, I lived in the desert. I woke up, I don't remember much when I was a baby. I'm sure you guys all remember when you were babies, but--
Sam: Nope. Usually not.
Jon: I always thought that's how it was done.
Sam: Nope. Nobody does. So far, so good.
Taliesin: Don't break him, please.
Jon: But the only thing I knew, I was orphaned, I didn't-- I never know my parents, 'cause I woke up in a basket, in a small creek, and the only thing that was there were ducks.
Sam: Wait, wait--
Taliesin: No, no, no, don't say wait! Go on.
Marisha: Just let him tell his story.
Jon: And ever since then, ducks have been my spirit animal, and I feel like they bring me strength, and bring me-- make me smarter and they give me courage. So I grew up in the desert. It was a rough time, but--
Taliesin: Were these desert ducks?
Marisha: Yeah, how'd you know they were ducks? Normally ducks don't live in the desert.
Taliesin: These must have been very interesting ducks.
Liam: They were actually vultures. (laughter)
Laura: You're not there.
Jon: What's a vult--
Taliesin: Nothing-- said a voice that wasn't there. Carry on.
Marisha: They were ducks.
Jon: It was a small pond in the middle of the desert. Some people called it an oasis or something.
Taliesin: An oasis, yes.
Jon: Now, you know, I never saw ducks again there, so, I don't know, but I'm confident they were real.
Taliesin: Migratory, perhaps.
Marisha: The ducks blessed you. And your birth and your survival.
Jon: Yeah, I just, uh--
Marisha: He doesn't know what a vulture is! (chuckles)
Jon: I realised I was strong, and I could do really, you know, awesome things with my body, so I did-- that kind of helped me when growing up, and then finally I came to the city of--
Sam: (whispers) Ank'harel.
Jon: Ank'harel.
Marisha: That's a continent, but-- oh wait, no, the continent-- no, Marquet is the continent. Ank'harel is the city, okay.
Jon: Yeah, stupid. (laughter)
Marisha: That's fair. I've earned that.
Jon: Ever since I got to the city, I started using it, but people would abuse me, and my body for its, like, abilities. So until one day, I met Aes. He was kind, and he brought me into his family.
Marisha: Family.
Jon: A lot of talk of family, today.
Marisha: He talked a lot of family to you?
Sam: And ducks.
Marisha: And ducks. Did he talk much more about his family to you?
Jon: No, I didn't-- I didn't know he had a daughter. I mean, there was this really, like, killer babe in our group, I didn't-- where is he? Where's Aes, you guys?
Taliesin: Aes ain't here right now.
Jon: Well, don't tell him, but... I always had a thing for her, but now that I know it's his daughter, yeesh.
Taliesin: You're not the first.
Jon: Yeah, that's good to know. So. But no, I didn't know much about, you know, he didn't tell me much, I didn't ask a lot of questions. Nobody's ever asked me questions. You guys are great.
Taliesin: Boy, that's not true. But that's good. You're a fascinating creature, sir. Good man.
Marisha: We like you. We like you, Chode. Lionel. We like you, Lionel. Hey, Lion. C'mere, c'mere.
Sam: No.
Marisha: Parchment-boulder-shears. Parchment-boulder-shears! I'm going to teach you.
Sam: It's like rock-paper-scissors.
Marisha: Okay, ready, ready, ready? Boulder, parchment, or shears. Okay. Ready? On three.
Jon: One, two, three.
Marisha: One, two, three.
Jon: I punch her. (laughter)
Taliesin: Never mind, not disappointed.
Matt: As this transpires, we come over to you two, having a drink. So you guys find a separate pub.
Laura: I figured we just sat under the Sun Tree.
Liam: Yeah, I've got a flask.
Matt: Okay, so you guys sit under the Sun Tree. It's midafternoon.
Liam: This is complicated. Real complicated.
Laura: Yeah. I was so happy to see him.
Liam: Me, too. Grog and Pike were not happy to see him.
Laura: No. We've got to find a way to get them talking again.
Liam: Yeah. Yeah. I think they will, but you're right, it will take some massaging. You know, I wasn't lying, I knew we would see him again.
Laura: I know. Couldn't let him know that, though.
Liam: This has been nice. It's always nice.
Laura: Mm-hm?
Liam: I'm real happy in my setup these days, but--
Laura: With Keyleth?
Liam: That was the implication, yeah. But I miss you busting my balls on the regular.
Laura: I know, right? Yeah. I miss it, too.
Liam: I think-- we were about to head back, but we've got to get this sorted out first.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: What do you reckon's next? We're going to Marquet, then?
Laura: Yeah, probably Ank'harel.
Liam: You all right?
Laura: Yeah, I'm fine.
Liam: You don't seem fine.
Laura: No, I'm great. You know, it's interesting, Scanlan being back. Makes me realize that, you know, he's not the only one who keeps secrets.
Liam: Mm-hm.
Laura: And you can't blame someone for keeping things to themselves, so I'm not mad at him anymore for the things that he keeps to himself, because everybody's got their something, you know?
Liam: Are you getting at something?
Laura: No, I'm just saying, I understand where he's coming from, and I am all right with it now. I'm fine with it. With the secrets.
Liam: I feel like I'm missing something.
Laura: No, nothing at all.
Liam: Well, I'm not mad at him. I hope Pike and Grog can come around.
Laura: I think they will. He's quite charming. I think everyone will come around.
Liam: I hope so. I feel like, you know.
Laura: The Sun Tree? Pelor? Raven Queen?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Hey! (laughter)
Liam: I wonder if it's time.
Laura: Time for what?
Liam: Nothing, I'm drunk, never mind. Did you see this ring I picked up?
Laura: (laughs) Oh, did you buy that off a little caravan?
Liam: Yeah, while you guys were fucking about with him.
Laura: That's great!
Liam: It's very handsome.
Laura: It's really nice. It's really nice.
Liam: Yeah. Well. I love you.
Laura: I love you. Glad we're all here. I'm glad we're all here!
Liam: All of us. All of us. Do you want to go find the rest?
Laura: Yeah!
Liam: Let's go find the rest.
Matt: Okay, all right.
Marisha: Right as Vax walks in-- Fuck!
Matt: You guys begin walking back to the pub. You've been hearing the commotion in the distance. You assume that's it. You watch as Grog walks by in a huff.
Laura: Grog?
Liam: Big man?
Travis: What?
Laura: Are you all right?
Travis: Cat. C-A-T. And I leave.
Laura: You're so smart! Do we see Pike come out after him?
Matt: You're still in the tavern?
Ashley: I left after him.
Matt: You did. So then you watch Pike come out in a huff a little after him.
Laura: Pike?
Ashley: Hey!
Laura: What happened in there?
Ashley: Oh, nothing. Just hanging out. Just having a drink. I'm going to go take a nap, I'm very tired.
Laura: Pike.
Liam: Insight check.
Laura: Well, we don't really need to roll an insight check to see this one's not doing so well.
Liam: It was really low.
Ashley: I'm great! I'm all right. Just going to sleep it off, I think.
Liam: Yeah, too much to drink, probably.
Ashley: Yeah, I'm feeling very drunk, so I'm going to go to bed.
Liam: Pickled Pickle.
Ashley: I'm a pickled Pickle, yeah. But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Laura: Everything will be better in the morning.
Ashley: Sleep is the best medicine.
Sam: You are a cleric.
Matt: Pike wanders off. You guys make your way to the tavern where the commotion's there. You walk in just as you see Keyleth and Lionel in the process and about to play an intense game of Boulder-Parchment-Shears before Lionel just decks Keyleth across the face.
Marisha: Hey, guys! We're playing Boulder-Parchment-Shears! And then I Alter Self my fist into a rock elemental fist, a Keyteor fist, and I go, see, look! Boulder! And I backhand Lionel.
Matt: First off, you roll damage for her now. That's going to be a d4 plus your...
Taliesin: d4, you already hit. Just the d4.
Matt: I'll say you hit because she wasn't expecting it.
Sam: Is he still raging?
Matt: He's still raging at this point. Why not?
Jon: I'm still raging. How long does that last?
Matt: Actually, no, you'd have to be raging again because you did do your whole duck speech.
Jon: Six.
Matt: So you could rage and then attack.
Jon: So I could rage-- yeah, okay, so, that was just-- yeah, that was all right.
Matt: So you take six damage. Now, Keyleth, go ahead and make an attack roll. With your earth elemental, I believe it's a plus what, to hit?
Marisha: Just with my fist? Sure, you want me to use Earth elemental? I mean, yeah, yeah, totes.
Matt: Just the attack bonus.
Marisha: 18.
Matt: 18? What's your armor class? You just hit. Add your strength modifier to one. So what's your strength modifier?
Marisha: Just to one? Plus five. So, six, six damage.
Matt: So, six damage, you take, whack! To the chin. Her fist is a rock.
Jon: And do I take half that or no?
Matt: If you started raging before that, then yes, you would.
Taliesin: But you weren't raging yet.
Jon: Okay.
Matt: But you can use your reaction to-- Off a Duck's Back.
Jon: No, no, I don't want to.
Matt: So you take the five damage right to the jaw. Whack! So now you got both sides of the jaw ringing a little bit in pain.
Marisha: This is the best game of Boulder-Parchment-Shears!
Jon: Who else wants to-- Is it just a two-player game?
Taliesin: I am walking away with my chocolate milk and walking over to you guys. They're bonding.
Jon: And as he's going, I sneak a bullet from him.
Taliesin: You can try. You can certainly try.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for that. Roll your sleight of hand. And Percival, I want you to go ahead and roll a perception check.
Taliesin: Perception is 19.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll.
Jon: So I have to get what?
Taliesin: You're rolling with sleight of hand, so add sleight of hand to whatever you roll.
Jon: 13 plus 11. 24.
Sam: He beat it.
Matt: You pocket a little shot.
Laura: Oh, shit, he beat my passive perception, too!
Matt: Yeah. Nobody sees it. Nobody sees it.
Taliesin: Well done.
Marisha: Hey, guys, does anyone have any shears?
Taliesin: Yes, and no.
Marisha: Shears?
Taliesin: I have them. You can't have them.
Matt: So Percival walks past and approaches them.
Taliesin: They're bonding. He's a bit adorable.
Laura: Seems nice.
Liam: He's likable.
Taliesin: I am angry, frustrated, and violent, and so I'm going to try something new and drink chocolate milk, and listen to you and do whatever it is you think is best at this point. I don't know what to do. What do we do? What do I do?
Laura: I don't know what to do either, dear. I think it's a matter of... Forgive.
Taliesin: Well, I'm not there yet, but I know I'm feeling emotional, and I know that's when I need to shut up and listen to you.
Laura: Well, it's going to take time, I think. I'm surprisingly okay with it. I'm just happy he's back.
Taliesin: I'm less not-okay than I thought I'd be. I'm worried about Grog.
Laura: I'm very worried about him and Pike.
Taliesin: I'm very worried about Pike. I don't know what to do.
Liam: Are they fist-fighting in the background?
Marisha: I go, hey guys, hey guys! Shears! And I grab onto his plate armor and I cast Heat Metal. (sizzle)
Matt: Your armor suddenly begins to turn bright orange and burn your skin. (sizzle)
Jon: Oh! Okay, okay, that hurts, that hurts.
Matt: How much damage does that do, Marisha?
Marisha: 2d8 damage.
Taliesin: Oh, that's going to hurt. And you get to re-roll that one, don't you?
Marisha: Oh, I do. Elemental damage. Ooh, yeah. Ten damage.
Liam: Fuck him up, babe!
Matt: (sizzle) It sears into you, and you're like, "Ooh, it burns! That's new! That's new! That's new pain!"
Jon: I try to do a little bit of the Off a Duck's Back.
Matt: Yeah, so you go ahead and you take five damage. You shrink into your armor. You try and minimize your torso.
Liam: He's turtling.
Taliesin: All right, one second. I'm going to gently walk up behind them while this is happening and I'm going to Vulcan neck pinch him with the Diplomacy.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Taliesin: That's... Where is that? There it is.
Jon: This is going to take a saving throw?
Taliesin: 21 to hit.
Jon: I have danger sense, so does that...?
Matt: Yeah, so what's the save on that?
Jon: It just says I have advantage.
Matt: On dexterity saving throws.
Jon: On dexterity saving throws. Is that a dexterity?
Matt: What's it say on Diplomacy?
Taliesin: It's a... I have to pull out the thing, I didn't pull this together as much as I thought I should've. It's a constitution saving throw.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Which is a d20. I'm going to roll the damage really quickly. Oh wow, this is a lot of damage. I apologize. 17 points of lightning damage.
Matt: So you take 17 points of lightning damage.
Taliesin: Constitution saving throw now.
Jon: 20.
Taliesin: He saves. That's a natural 20. Oh well, that didn't work.
Matt: You feel this burst of electrical energy.
Taliesin: That was supposed to knock you out, and now it didn't.
Jon: Yeah, and it's just like, ha, that tickled. I'm going to go to bed, you guys. That was fun. Anybody else want to? No? Okay, I'm going.
Matt: And Lionel just leaves.
Taliesin: This thing never works properly. I really have to work on that.
Jon: That was a weak hit, by the way, if you were trying to hit me. See you. Oh, wait, hold on. Are you going to drink this chocolate milk?
Taliesin: You can take it. You've earned it.
Jon: I'll take it.
Sam: Just leaves the bar with the glass.
Taliesin: Another gold coin goes on the table.
Liam: I mean, would you stop it?
Taliesin: No.
Matt: So the four of you now sit there in the bar.
Laura: Five of us, Tary is there.
Matt: Tary is there, that's right.
Sam: He really would be good for the brigade.
Taliesin: I kind of like him.
Sam: Yeah, yeah.
Taliesin: He's the sort of positive energy I think your family's going to need around.
Sam: Absolutely. I like him a lot.
Laura: Are you sure you can't stay?
Sam: I'm staying for a little while. I have to find Doty.
Taliesin: I understand.
Sam: I have to find Doty and get some stuff, and then I've got to be on my way.
Taliesin: By the way, what you said back there, with your family, about me.
Sam: Yes?
Taliesin: That was very flattering.
Sam: Well, I know you're taken, and, you know.
Taliesin: Doesn't mean I can't be flattered. I'm quite flattered. That was very flattering.
Sam: I meant it.
Taliesin: And, you know, if things were different, I would feel the same way. If things were very different.
Sam: I get it. I get it. You're sort of making it worse.
Taliesin: You're quite a catch. You're quite a catch.
Laura: Can you stop flirting with each other?
Taliesin: I thought it might be fun. All right. I'm going to gather up our things and prop up the table again and leave-- How much gold would be appropriate for the damage and then some?
Matt: The table isn't that expensive, to be honest. Between the drinks you guys had, a solid seven or eight gold will handle it.
Taliesin: I'm going to leave ten gold and be like, I'm so sorry, but try never not to make it worth your while and not be too horrible.
Matt: "It's nice to know that the de Rolos are as lively as the rest of the people who live here."
Taliesin: Thank you for running this establishment. Have a good day.
Matt: "You, too, my lord. My lady."
Taliesin: Let's go find the kids and see if we can make them feel better.
Laura: I think they were going to bed, but we can try.
Marisha: Keyleth throws her arm around Vax and catches him up the whole way we walk. I really think you would really like Chode. He's super nice, and he likes drinking chocolate milk...
Liam: I do, I like him already. He's instantly likable.
Marisha: We got to talk a lot. We talked about his background...
Liam: I was trying to...
Marisha: Yeah, gosh. Where were you?
Liam: I was trying to pitch him to Tary, but I really like him. I want him to stay.
Sam: No, this is all good. I love how you've all fallen in love with Chod over here. It took you guys a full two weeks to even stomach me for a day, but that's all right. It's fine.
Taliesin: We not asking him to join, while we were thinking about having you join.
Sam: No, he's great, though. We're instant love with him.
Taliesin: He's not Vox Machina material, though.
Jon: Are you Taryon right now?
Liam: Hey, you know, I feel like we were about to make our exit, but it's a little more complicated now, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: Might need to stay on a day or two.
Taliesin: Are we doing this thing?
Laura: Oh, we're definitely doing this. We're going to Ank'harel.
Liam: I think we got to.
Marisha: The ziggurat's kind of a big deal, right? I feel like that's warranted for extra Ashari leave time, for diplomatic duty. Right?
Taliesin: You said duty.
Marisha: I did say duty.
Taliesin: I know. I knew you would know. Never change.
Marisha: I'll let Dad know he's going to have to watch the tribe for a few more weeks.
Taliesin: I'll let Cass know.
Marisha: But one of these days I will have to be getting back. Very soon.
Taliesin: Let's talk to Pike. Let's talk to Grog. Let's see how they feel.
Laura: Pike? Grog? Did you put your earrings back on?
Matt: You hear nothing.
Laura: Scanlan.
Sam: Yes?
Laura: I think they're really depressed, dear.
Taliesin: I think they're angry and sad.
Sam: What? Percy?
Marisha: Oh, this is like a one-channel frequency. We can all hear you.
Taliesin: Oh, is this a party line?
Marisha: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.
Laura: I'm just letting you know their earrings are off. They can't hear us.
Taliesin: Or they're not talking.
Sam: What should I do?
Laura: Say you're sorry.
Sam: But they can't hear me.
Laura: Well, go fucking find them.
Marisha: Something like this is better done in person, as opposed to over a communication device.
Sam: I shouldn't text my apology?
Marisha: Nope, you should not.
Taliesin: Boy, there's a life lesson. D&D continued.
Liam: Don't use the Message spell to drop heavy shit!
Taliesin: Eye contact, motherfuckers. Eye contact.
Jon: Right then I walk into wherever he is, right?
Matt: Right, you go back to the tavern.
Jon: And I walk in. Hey. Boss. I got you the bullets.
Sam: You did?
Jon: Yeah.
Sam: You are my best man!
Taliesin: I did give him a bag of musket shot. It's okay. Carry on.
Jon: So, anyways. I'm going to go to bed now.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Jon: It's nighttime, right?
Sam: Yeah, no, it is. But did I buy him a room, or is he just sort of...?
Jon: No, you don't have to buy me a room.
Matt: You bought out the inn.
Jon: I'll just go sleep in the corner either way.
Sam: Okay. Yeah. If anyone tries to kill me, kill them.
Jon: Oh, yeah, I got it. I have danger sense.
Sam: Oh, you do?
Jon: And the ducks will tell me if there's anything wrong.
Sam: The ducks. Yes, I know this about you.
Jon: I actually have Commune with Ducks.
Taliesin: He does actually have Commune with Ducks. It is on the page. Staring at it right now.
Jon: You know what, I'm going to use it right now.
Sam: Do we have ducks near us?
Taliesin: There are ducks in Whitestone!
Matt: In Whitestone, there's a lot more ducks in this area than there are in Marquet.
Taliesin: There are ducks. We have ponds in the local park. There's a small pond in the cemetery.
Jon: I forget I can do that wherever I go, and I never get the chance.
Sam: What are you going to ask them?
Jon: They can tell me up to three facts about the land.
Taliesin: Yes, what do the ducks of Whitestone say?
Marisha: What do the ducks say?
Taliesin: (quacking)
Matt: As you take a moment and you kneel, and you close your eyes, you envision the connection you had as a child to the ducks along the pond of the oasis, and as you open your eyes again, you see there, waddling in through the doorway of the inn, as the sun in the afternoon is going down to dusk, this one duck (quacking).
Jon: Hey, Brownie! What do you have to say about this place?
Matt: What do you want to ask it?
Jon: Oh, I have to ask.
Sam: All I hear is quacking, right? He's just quacking at the duck?
Matt: You're just hearing quacking back and forth.
Jon: Do we get bad weather here? Do you get bad storms here?
Matt: You hear through the duck's quacks, "It rains quite often, actually. It's pretty cloudy. Great."
Jon: Okay, so don't leave the hut without an umbrella, okay?
Sam: Okay, thank you.
Jon: And then, do we have to worry about-- Are there any pyramids? Have you seen any pyramids around the place?
Matt: The duck's head turns the other way, and it says to you through quacks, "Actually, there's one below the city."
Taliesin: How do the ducks know that?
Laura: They wander everywhere.
Taliesin: How did they get down there?
Matt: The essence of nature.
Marisha: The same reason why pigeons are in Costco, okay?
Jon: He said there's another pyramid under the city.
Sam: The duck knew that?
Jon: Yeah!
Sam: That is crazy.
Jon: Should we go?
Sam: No, no, no.
Jon: Okay... Is there anything you need to know, master?
Sam: Yes.
Jon: About this area. It's pretty limited.
Sam: Have Vox Machina been happy?
Jon: Ducks, do you know if that group over there, have they been happy? Have they been happy?
Matt: "They didn't look happy when they left the tavern."
Jon: I think we all knew that you kind of wasted that last one. It's okay, we did it. See you, Brownie! That was awesome!
Matt: (flapping wings)
Jon: Can we go to another city sometime soon so I can do that again?
Sam: Yes, we will definitely do that. Absolutely. Yeah. You need to use that skill more often. You know what the problem is, we don't have as many ducks in Ank'harel.
Jon: I know. And most of the time I just find out if it's going to rain or not. It's not that useful.
Sam: You've been great this whole trip.
Jon: Thank you.
Sam: I'll tell you what. I'm going to buy some ducks, and just keep them back in Ank'harel for you. They can be your little birds.
Jon: I go to hug him, but then I forget that he's... Is he still enchanted?
Sam: No, I'm a little guy.
Jon: I squeeze him hard. A little too hard, probably.
Sam: Ow, ow.
Jon: All right, I'm going to go sleep in the corner.
Sam: Please do.
Matt: Sleeps in the corner. All right. Scanlan, are you doing anything?
Sam: I mean, I was told to come apologize and find them.
Travis: I was told...
Sam: I'll go seek my friends out there in the world.
Matt: All right. Where do you go?
Sam: Where am I going? Hello? It's me, Scanlan Shorthalt.
Laura: Where do you want to go?
Sam: I don't know, where is everybody?
Laura: Well. Pike and Grog went back to their rooms.
Sam: I don't want to disturb them. They're by themselves, alone. Should I go knock on their doors?
Laura: It's up to you.
Sam: Okay. I'll go find-- Do I know where they're staying?
Matt: You do. You've been to Whitestone Castle, you know where the rooms are in the castle, it's just been a while.
Sam: I'll go knock on Grog's door.
Jon: Do you need me for anything?
Sam: No, you sleep it off.
Jon: Are you sure?
Sam: Yeah, you've had too much chocolate milk.
Jon: Yeah, I am feeling a little bloated down there.
Matt: You make your way to the castle. You're let in, because the guards still recognize you as a member of Vox Machina. Which room do you go to first?
Sam: Grog.
Matt: Grog. Are you in your room?
Travis: Mm-hm.
Matt: (knocking)
Travis: Pike?
Sam: It's me! Scan-man! Can I come in? I Dimension Door into the room.
Matt: Scanlan (poof) appears in the center of your chambers.
Sam: You okay? You didn't come to the door. Big fella.
Travis: I leave.
Sam: I let him go. I take a shit on his bed -- no, I'm kidding.
Matt: Grog leaves the chamber and exits.
Sam: I'll walk over to Pike's room, then.
Matt: Okay. Pike, are you in your room?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: (knocking)
Sam: Hello? It's me, Scan-man.
Ashley: What do you want?
Sam: Just to talk and say hello.
Ashley: Oh, but we already said hello.
Sam: Just to apologize again.
Ashley: I'll open the door. Yes?
Sam: Hey, listen. I know that we haven't seen each other in a while, and we left on weird terms. And everything that's happened between us. But I want you to know that I held no ill will towards you, and I thank you for agreeing to my request, a while ago, to look after Kaylie if I should fall. And I'm glad it didn't come to that, but it's an honor to know that you would have even considered it.
Ashley: Yeah. Yeah. I slap him across the face.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Matt: (echoing slap)
Ashley: Do you know... Do you remember what you said, before you left? I mean, obviously you said lots of things. But there was one thing in particular that's always bothered me.
Sam: What?
Ashley: You said that you were kept alive by some weird fucking magic. And that's what I do. And I brought you back so you could be with your daughter. So fuck you.
Sam: Well, that was a cheap shot.
Ashley: Sure. And you know what, I apologize for putting you in my clothes, but the Scanlan that we know would've thought that was funny. I'm sorry I didn't know your mother, but I imagine you don't know my mother's name.
Sam: I don't. Pike, I don't have anything to say in my defense. I was wrong, about the whole thing. I was not a good friend, and I was not a good teammate. And I'll have to live with that. But I can tell you this. I like who I am now, and I didn't then. So maybe, someday, we'll meet, and you'll get to know the new guy, but if it's not meant to happen right now, that's okay, and I understand. And I will go back to what I was doing before.
Ashley: So you like who you are better without us?
Sam: No. No, that's not what I meant. I meant, I like who I am now that I know my daughter, and I know that no matter what, I have someone out there who's rooting for me. And no matter what happens, I've got that. And I... Yeah. That's it. I don't like what I've been doing the last year in terms of, you know. I've been breaking the law a bit, which I know you don't love.
Ashley: I don't care what you do.
Sam: But I'm doing things that I want to do for me and my girl, and it's been rewarding and it's been fun, and that's all that matters at this point. I'm comfortable with the bastard that I've been, because I know that the man I am now is different. So I can't make everybody happy anymore, and I think that was my problem before. I was trying to make everyone happy, and that's not my goal anymore. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'm sorry how I treated you when we first met, how I ogled you and flirted with you relentlessly. That was disrespectful. But what I'm most sorry for is that you met me then, and not now. And that's all I can say.
Ashley: Well. Perhaps we'll meet again in different circumstances.
Sam: Okay.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: Good night.
Ashley: Good night.
Sam: I'll leave.
Matt: Okay. You make your way back.
Sam: And I'll just phone Vex real quick and say, hey, didn't work. I'm going to go back to Ank'harel now.
Laura: No, no, no, Scanlan.
Sam: Yeah, it's not working, it's not great, so, nope.
Laura: Scanlan, it takes time. Things take time.
Sam: I'm sure it does.
Laura: Scanlan, where are you?
Sam: I'm outside Pike's room, weirdly.
Laura: Shit. Stay there.
Sam: I mean, I think she can hear me talking through the door.
Laura: She can't, I don't think she's wearing the earring. Unless she put it back in.
Sam: No, no, no, I'm really outside her door, talking. I'm sure she can hear me through the door.
Laura: Oh, seriously? Right there?
Sam: Yeah. Yeah. Pike, can you hear me?
Ashley: Yes, I can hear you.
Sam: Yeah, she can totally hear everything.
Taliesin: This is an open channel. We can all hear.
Marisha: Hi, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, hi! Hi, Keyleth.
Liam: Maybe you should just sleep on it before leaving town, buddy.
Laura: Well, no, we're coming with you. You're not just leaving us again.
Marisha: Again!
Laura: You just got here.
Liam: And some of us are happy to see you.
Taliesin: We're going to go see the pyramid.
Marisha: Yeah, you can go to Ank'harel, but we'll be right behind you, I guess. We know who you are now, Aes... Agus...
Taliesin: Tary, are you in for one more adventure before heading home?
Sam: That would be a sweet close to it. I met you in Ank'harel, didn't I?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: I'm down.
Taliesin: Excellent.
Marisha: To Ank'harel in the morning, then. Because I'm trying to sleep, you motherfuckers.
Taliesin: Take your earring off, put it on silent if you ever want to fall asleep.
Marisha: The clasp is rusted from when we were in the water plane, I can't take it off.
Taliesin: We take ours off, I'm taking mine off now. Good night.
Laura: Okay, okay, shut up everyone.
Marisha: It's stuck there.
Matt: All right. You all eventually find yourselves to rest for the evening. Scanlan, you make your way back?
Sam: I'm going to leave the little rock thing that Grog gave me right outside his door, and I'll get Lionel up at first light, and I guess we'll set off for Ank'harel.
Laura: No!
Marisha: We'll see him there.
Matt: Okay. That's a two-week journey for you.
Sam: I got no other way to get there.
Marisha: You could come with us.
Sam: It was not offered.
Laura: Yes, you were, we didn't tell you to go! Scanlan, we said don't go!
Sam: Didn't you just say I will see you there?
Laura: No! Fucking Keyleth said that!
Marisha: I said if you run away we'll still find you.
Ashley: We'll still be right behind you.
Laura: We're not telling you to fucking go.
Sam: Wait, so you want to travel with me?
Laura: Yes!
Sam: Oh, okay, well, then I'll stick around.
Liam: All over the earring.
Taliesin: You know, I miss this drama. This is the drama I missed. This is great.
Matt: So we'll say at the next morning light, as you all come to consciousness, you find there, spry and waiting in the center of town, one Scanlan Shorthalt and one Lionel Gayheart, ready to join you on a trip back to Ank'harel. And that's where we'll pick up next week.
Travis: Did you want to say something?
Ashley: No.
Matt: Is there something you wanted to do? Something you wanted to button it on? Let's do it now. As you guys are gathering in the center of the city, on your way to the Sun Tree, they stand there in the light. You guys have your equipment on you, you're prepared for whatever may come on the other side of the world in the deserts of Marquet, wherever this mountain may be.
Ashley: Oh, you're still here.
Sam: Yeah. You need me to find this thing, so I'll lead you to it.
Ashley: I throw him a bag of cookies. So we opened a bakery while you were gone. We have these. They're called shorties. They're after you. So hopefully you like them.
Taliesin: Much like you, they're a bit disappointing.
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: I'll try-- Well, does it have any...
Jon: Cookies! (nom)
Matt: And that's where we'll end the episode this week.
Taliesin: Well fucking done, man! Well fucking done!
Laura: Holy crap!
Matt: Thank you so much for playing with us this week! That was so much fun!
Marisha: Yay Chode!
Sam: Chod?
Jon: She still can't get it right.
Matt: By the way, I forgot earlier to mention that PseudoSomething won the thing in the Twitch chat. Congratulations to you. Denoba will contact you if they haven't already to get your information.
Laura: What was under the blanket the whole time?
Matt: We'll have to wait 'til next week.
Taliesin: Next week is what's under the blanket. That or cake.
Matt: Possibly.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Taliesin: Actually, I was about to say, because he's not seen a proper battlemap, so maybe...
Matt: I'll show him once you guys leave, but yeah. Dude, thank you so much for coming and playing with us. Seriously.
Laura: That was so much fun.
Taliesin: That was amazing!
Marisha: Lionel!
Taliesin: Prepare for so much duck art. There's just going to be... It's going to be like a 50's study. It's going to be so much.
Sam: Ducks everywhere.
Matt: I love it.
Taliesin: Mallard art.
Laura: Oh my God, next week's our 100th episode! How fucking weird is it that we got the T-shirts released...
Matt: Oh, dude. The minute that you showed that the T-shirts had shown up to everyone in the store tonight, me and Sam were like...
Marisha: Like, if people didn't think we had a writer's room before, they definitely are now! This feels like a marketing campaign!
Taliesin: I didn't know about the shirts until we showed up. That's just been in process.
Laura: Yeah, we've just been working on this shirt for a while. And it came out this week.
Travis: We didn't plan that in any way.
Ashley: Serendipitous.
Matt: It's kind of amazing. But anyway, guys, we're going to go because some of us have flights in the morning to go the Stream of Annihilation tomorrow and Saturday at D&D. Big round of applause for Jon Heder. (cheering)
Matt: That's for you, that's for you. Have a wonderful night, guys. Rest well. And is it Thursday yet? Good night! [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hi, everyone! Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Good job, Sam. Thank you for your patience. Sorry we were off last week. I'm doing much better, for those who are worried about it. Happy to be back. Missed you guys, and happy to be back at this table. So yeah! It's been a couple of weeks. Let's go ahead and get into some announcements real fast. First off, tonight we have our fantastic sponsor, Shadow of War!
Travis: Shadow of War! Oh shit!
Laura: Are we allowed to say what we did in it?
Matt: Yeah, a number of us actually worked in the game. It comes out October 10th, actually.
Sam: And the full name of the game is Middle Earth: Shadow of War, for all of those who are looking for it alphabetically.
Travis: The sequel to Middle Earth  Shadow of Mordor.
Sam: Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling our asses off. I played a little character known as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording sessions.
Travis: I remember talking to you! I was Commanding Orc 1.
Sam: Oh, nice.
Matt: I was Professional Orc 1, as well as the Witch King of Angmar, the head of the Nazgul. I'm pretty excited about that.
Laura: Oh, nice!
Liam: I was Troy Baker's fluffer. It's prestigious.
Sam: You were in it, right? No?
Liam: I'm in the first one.
Sam: Oh, what did you do in the first one?
Liam: The thing I killed two weeks ago? That was me.
Sam: Laura, were you in it?
Laura: I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel.
Liam: You play a sword?!
Laura: I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf, right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be about my character.
Sam: Do you have a number after your character?
Laura: No, it's the only one. It's the coolest thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and Vax.
Matt: That's pretty great.
Laura: No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick. So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and she wears feathery armor. It's so freaking cool! So basically, it's like if Vax was a girl, which is Vex.
Travis: But with the sex appeal of Grog.
Laura: Of course, baby.
Matt: I will never forget being at the Shadow of War panel at Comic Con, and you mentioning the DLC and then going, "Has that even been announced yet?" And there was five seconds where I watched Laura wither away into a shell of a human before they went, "Oh, yeah, it's announced." And you reverted.
Laura: Even at this very moment, as I said it, aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?"
Liam: They scare you so bad that, even when it's official, I'm like "I'm in the--"
Travis: It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. We can testify.
Sam: We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right into the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us.
Travis: And make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order.
Matt: By the way, if you haven't played the previous game, the Nemesis system is one of the coolest things I've played in many games in a long time. I'm going to challenge you guys to try and pick out not only who you voice orc-wise, but then to try and make sure our orcs rise to the very top. So you have nothing but generals from Critical Role. I challenge you for this. Because that would be pretty cool.
Liam: I hope you like hearing the word ranger.
Liam: Ranger!
Travis: Ranger!
Laura: Ranger!
Matt: It's going to be fun. All right, thank you, Shadow of War for being our sponsor tonight. We're excited about the game, and hope you are, too. Also, there's been a lot of insane weather tragedies that have been in the news recently. I want to make sure that everyone knows that if you want to help support relief for both of the hurricanes that have come and torn through the U.S., we have a link to the Red Cross to donate and be part of that. It'll be available in the chat and throughout the rest of the game tonight, so if you have the opportunity to help out, I highly recommend it. Come help these people that have lost a lot in the past couple weeks or so. Give what you can. I've given, and we really appreciate that support.
Travis: They'll let you delineate between Harvey and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J. Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma, the damage is still accruing.
Matt: I grew up in Florida. I know the area well, and I have family out there that endured it. It's very close to me. So if you can, greatly appreciate it. Let's see here. Merch! Laura.
Laura: This feels so weird to say after you mentioned that.
Travis: Nah, but we make happy stuff.
Laura: Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully.
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: I'll show it to you, and my back brace, to make it really better.
Sam: Are we selling those in the store?
Matt: The back brace?
Travis: Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you!
Liam: We missed an opportunity to put Backblaze on that back brace. (groaning)
Laura: Next time.
Matt: Next time.
Liam: No next time!
Laura: There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled.
Matt: Thank you, Laura. Also reminding you guys, we have up to episode 40 of Critical Role now released on iTunes, Google, and geekandsundry.com has all the information for it. So if you want to listen to the podcast, or your friends have been like, "I don't want to watch it, but I just want to hear it."
Laura: I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it.
Matt: It's good for commutes.
Marisha: Also, clarification, speaking of saying things prematurely before I should have. I've gotten a lot of questions being like, "What happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said it, and then I looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But do not announce this part." Which, why was it even on our announcement sheet? Still my fault.
Matt: To be fair, I remember looking down at the sheet as you were announcing it.
Marisha: Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch. So ten at a time. That's what you get.
Taliesin: It's like one cookie at a time. You can't bake one cookie at a time.
Marisha: It's just better to do them in a block.
Matt: Thank you for the heads-up on that. We announced a while back the Critical Role six-issue mini-series comic book. We announced last week that it's going through Dark Horse, which I'm super excited about.
Travis: DM is very excited.
Matt: Oh, yeah. Dark Horse was my introduction. I was probably in fourth grade when I got into the Alien comics through Dark Horse. I didn't realize there was more to explore. Dude, I've been a fan of them ever since. Being able to take this into their realm is brilliant. I'm so excited. First issue drops on the 20th, guys.
Marisha: The digital issue. The first issue releases digitally this coming Wednesday.
Sam: Is it good? I haven't read it.
Laura: It's so good!
Sam: Why have you all read it and I haven't?
Marisha: Because you don't read your emails.
Sam: Yeah, that's fair.
Liam: You show up ten minutes after we start, you leave an hour before we end the game every week.
Sam: That's true.
Matt: So that's coming up. It will be on Comixology, iBooks, Dark Horse Digital, Kindle, Nook, Google Play, etc. It's written by our good friend, Matt Colville. It's drawn beautifully by our good friend, Olivia Samson from the Critter community, and the coloring and lettering by Chris Northrop. Super stoked, hope you guys enjoy it. So look out for that next week.
Liam: Looks fucking awesome! The writing is awesome! The art is awesome!
Matt: What he said.
Laura: Did you already say about the physical copies, too? When those will be released?
Matt: We'll have a trade available in spring 2018.
Liam: It's coming out with the DLC for Middle Earth.
Matt: Yeah, to tie in with it. Of course, we have Talks Machina coming up this Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here with our fantastic host, Brian. We'll be talking about our episode tonight. So look for that next week. All the Critical Role episodes are now available on Alpha. They've gone back and added the bells and whistles, the information, the stats, everything, for all the episodes before Alpha even launched. So if you ever watched it there, it's all updated.
Sam: I really should check my email!
Taliesin: We would miss this sense of wonder that we get to share with the community. It's really nice.
Marisha: They get your unbridled reaction.
Taliesin: It's like watching Home Alone next to Macaulay Culkin. It's great. I'm getting so much out of it.
Matt: All righty. Last few things. One  this is Sub-tember, guys, by the way, for Twitch. Sub-tember means for the next few weeks, Twitch has a special promotion where subscriptions are half off for new subs for every Twitch channel, including this one. So if you've been watching and you've always wanted to subscribe, but you never really felt like you can give the full $5, it's half off this month. So if you want to subscribe to our Twitch, now's the month to do it. Just giving the heads-up. It's pretty rad, and thank you, Sub-tember. Last but not least, Laura and Travis, you are going to be at an event soon, aren't you?
Travis: Yeah! End of this month, we're going to be at Anime Weekend Atlanta. The last week of September. Hotlanta, Georgia. We're going to be there with other people like Jennifer Hale and people like that. But we're going to be there. Come out, say hi, smack our hands, not our faces.
Laura: Give a high-five.
Marisha: I love Atlanta.
Travis: It's pretty dope. I want to get in that aquarium with those whale sharks. That's what I want to do. We're not going to have time for that. And then, also, in the middle of November, we're going to be going to Australia. Laura and I are going for two weeks. We're going to be in Adelaide, Brisbane. So for all the Aussies-- what?
Laura: I've got to get my passport.
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: Expedite!
Travis: So barring Laura's passport showing up--
Matt: You can hear the $400 burn away instantly. That's how much it costs to expedite.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm doing that tomorrow! I'm going to write a note in my calendar.
Travis: (sighs) Adelaide, Brisbane. If you're there, you want to see us, come see maybe just me. (laughter)
Sam: Everybody tweet Laura tomorrow at noon, saying--
Laura: No, but seriously! If you want to, feel free.
Travis: Will Friedle will be there, too. He's going to be my convention wife. Me and Friedle.
Laura: I'm writing an email to myself.
Marisha: Australia? Is that when we got caught with having to have those weird travel visas, as well?
Matt: Yeah. Make sure you get your travel visas.
Marisha: Yeah, we didn't know until we got to the airport. And then they're like, "You have to have one." And then we're like, "Oh, okay." Luckily, you can do it online.
Travis: Oh, I totally have that covered.
Matt: All right. Well, cool, guys! Thank you so much. Thank you for dealing with our long announcements. It's been a few weeks. However, I think, with that, it's time to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. I'll remember this. Why's everything targeting Scanlan in this battle? Welcome back, everyone. So last we left off, Vox Machina, preparing themselves for a final fray with the recently ascended god, Vecna, the Undying King, discovered that he had brought the city of Thar Amphala about 300 miles northwest, of Vasselheim on the continent of Issylra. Upon gathering allies to assail this region, you discovered that it was shifting, moving. And apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial earth titan had been risen and began marching its way towards Vasselheim with Thar Amphala embedded at the top of its torso, protected by some sort of magical barrier. With an advance army of wyvern riders at your back and J'mon Sa Ord giving you a ride between their wings, you made your way southward. Quickly depositing yourselves within a waterfall, expelling opening towards the hip of this large titan undead beast, you began to fight your way to the interior. Dealing with corrupted earth elemental shards, you began to make your way through the catacombs, the long ruined and abandoned dwarven city of Thomara, where you encountered the tomb of the dwarven king. Where you also managed to raid the tomb, found a magical item, and dealt with some fun traps in the process. Then, continuing to follow where this route led you upward, hopefully towards the underbelly of the city of Thar Amphala, you uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did battle with some undead trolls that immediately rushed in and attacked you. You managed to destroy them, and make your way out through a small cavern that had just momentarily collapsed, clearing out of the way. You all began to squeeze through the opening to find the next length of your journey. And that's where we left off. As you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening, you come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each impact of the feet of the titan you're currently riding within. It seems to be going at a steady incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to 45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet.
Sam: How do you play Dungeons and Dragons?
Matt: Two weeks, Sam? It's too much for you?
Sam: I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed to do now. Insight check! I got nothing.
Liam: I'm going to do my due diligence and scoot a little ahead of everybody and start looking for traps or anything hinky.
Travis: Wait, Vax. You should consult that little scrawny NPC fellow that was supposed-- oh, wait. Oh, he's dead.
Liam: Did anybody see that guy?
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Yeah, we did. We saw him.
Matt: Well, you saw the corpse after it was there, yeah.
Liam: Nobody asked me about him.
Laura: No, because you did a good job of killing that.
Liam: That clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating flesh, as I saw it, so problem solved. We're on a time table, yeah?
Laura: We should keep moving upwards, I'm assuming?
Sam: Did we get any items recently?
Travis: No, I picked up that hammer that was hitting me in the face.
Laura: Well, yeah. But Percy, the belt?
Sam: Yeah, what does it do?
Taliesin: Stuff, things. I'm using it right now.
Marisha: Do we need to do a switchery-poo of our items?
Laura: I think we maybe should do that, actually.
Sam: We all have potions, right? Did we pass out potions?
Travis: We all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon.
Liam: Are we going to take a little 20-minute breather here?
Sam: This is just for us to remember what we're doing. I don't know. Should we stop? I think we're on a timetable. We should keep moving, right? Does anyone need to heal?
Marisha: We just stopped, right?
Matt: You'd taken a brief rest after the battle with the trolls where you guys began to look about the inside of the vault. And that's where the part of the exit collapsed.
Travis: I didn't roll any hit dice. Should we roll some hit dice?
Marisha: You dug things out?
Laura: But he was doing something? He was reading, or something.
Sam: Yeah, you were trying to read Dwarvish, or something. And it took an hour.
Travis: I clearly do not remember this. That's right, I remember. I don't remember what I read, but I remember.
Sam: It just said, "Do not enter."
Travis: Yep. There were things.
Liam: We're doing the Vox Machina thing and standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to attune the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic damage.
Matt: All righty. Necrotic it is.
Travis: We also need to be on the lookout for that sword, remember? In the story?
Sam: The sword of Kas?
Travis: Just saying. Keep your eyes peeled, high-perception people.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I literally can't see anything.
Laura: Wait, we have light.
Marisha: (whoosh)
Laura: Yeah, see?
Matt: Between her hand, his dagger, and Pike's mace, you have a few light sources that you guys maintain.
Laura: Pike's mace is lit up. We said that last time.
Matt: But do keep in mind that light sources also do make you a bright beacon in dark places.
Laura: Probably your hands are less noticeable than Pike's mace.
Liam: Oh, I don't know.
Taliesin: I think they would be less intimidated by a glowing mace than by glowing hands, at this point.
Matt: Glowing hands is like a small torch firelight. The Mace of Disruption--
Liam: Is like a headlamp.
Laura: So maybe we'll not have the mace on.
Liam: "Yeah, okay. I'll put this away."
Laura: That sounded just like her.
Sam: She's turning more and more Canadian as you go.
Liam: She's kind of Canadian already. Come on.
Matt: So if I could have a marching order, please?
Liam: Yo. Up front, looking for traps.
Laura: Did you want this acid-resistant armor? You'd at least be resistant to acid.
Travis: And Vex is probably with her brother. I'll be right behind the twins. It's the twins and then me. Who wants to be behind?
Taliesin: I'll be behind you.
Matt: Okay. Do you have Trinket out, Vex?
Laura: Yeah, Trinket is out.
Matt: Percy's after Grog.
Marisha: Me.
Matt: Keyleth, and then we have Pike and Scanlan holding up the rear. All righty, there you go. Have that marked down. How far ahead are you tracking?
Liam: 20 feet.
Matt: So 20 feet ahead, you begin to make your way up the incline, and it is loose rock in this tunnel. As you step, there are elements that skid and fall beneath the pressure of your feet, and you have to be careful as you progress up the incline based on how much it continues upward to keep your footing.
Laura: Brother.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me.
Liam: I turn around and look at her and go  all right.
Laura: You said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me, I'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you.
Liam: You're stage-whispering and that's very easy to hear.
Laura: Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all right?
Liam: I love you. Perception check. Investigation for traps? Yeah. That is a 25.
Matt: Okay. No traps catch your attention. As you progress forward, you begin to notice the tunnel seems to be pincering a bit the further you go. The sides of the walls begin to close in and eventually, about 30 feet ahead, comes from the 15, 20-foot width that the initial entrance way into this carved tunnel was, pinches to about three feet wide.
Sam: How tall?
Matt: About five and half, six feet tall?
Taliesin: Is this pressure by design, or is this what's been done to the structure by the transformation?
Matt: You'll probably have to get closer to see. Where you are currently, it looks like part of the tunnel was carved outward and then shaken, and elements of it collapsed and loosened the earth that at one point was packed at the sides.
Laura: And the tunnel's rising steadily upwards?
Matt: Yeah. It's coming at an incline.
Travis: How's it look?
Liam: It's dark up there. I can only see about 60 feet up. Does it keep going beyond that?
Matt: The incline isn't increasing. It gets to about a 45-degree incline and then maintains that up until the outside of your visual range.
Liam: Okay. I'm a punching bag for this shit. Why don't you all wait here a minute. Wait.
All: Wait.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up there?
Liam: Well, will you go with me?
Laura: Of course. Can you not use your wings?
Liam: They're gone.
Laura: Well, then hop on.
Liam: This could be the last time we do this. Come on.
Sam: Oh god.
Liam: Well, there's only four games left, Sam.
Laura: You don't know that!
Liam: It's scripted! (laughter)
Marisha: That's going to be a Reddit thread later.
Laura: Do we have Pass Without a Trace on?
Liam: Yeah, I think that probably faded by now.
Matt: Not if you haven't recast it because after the short rest it would've been gone.
Laura: Should I cast that on us?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: No, wait! I shouldn't because I got a proficiency, so we're both stealthy stealth. We're fine. So we're just going to go. I'm not casting it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them.
Liam: Right. We'll go 60 feet up, see what we can see.
Laura: And then come back down.
Liam: Sure. Or you could stay there and I could go even further up 60 feet--
Laura: All right. As long as everybody's within 60 feet of me. Because we're getting really close and I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring.
Taliesin: That's right. I forgot about the ring.
Liam: All right. Let's do that.
Matt: So as you guys glide up on the broom, stealthily, I want you guys both to roll a stealth check, please.
Travis: Pick from your fucking 300 dice.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Travis: Almost poked my eye out. You almost made me Vecna.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 29.
Laura: 30.
Matt: All right. That's impressive. So as you both quietly coast your way past this entrance way, squeezing into this two and a half, three-foot-wide location, you get just within the 60 foot range and look up and Vax, you step off the broom and make your way quietly up to the other side of the range. You get about 30 feet beyond the broom before your vision meets where this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there is a solid, rocky blockage.
Laura: What do you see?
Liam: It's corked up. It's all right. Yeah, it's blocked up with stone. I guess I'd have to get a closer look to see if we could get through.
Laura: Well, get a fucking closer look.
Taliesin: If we have to, we can just have Grog beat it down.
Laura: Yes, but quiet is the key word.
Taliesin: Is it? We can try and time it to a step.
Liam: Hand on the sides to get my way up closer to it. Looking for any traps.
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check as you're climbing up to maintain the strength, as the incline is now towards the end getting more and more steep.
Liam: Get ready to catch me.
Laura: I'm going to hover.
Liam: Yes! My athletics is a two, but I rolled a 19, so 21.
Matt: Deftly, you manage to find the proper handholds and pull your strength up as the final bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight carrying situation, and you come to the edge of the rock and you see it. It does appear to be a rocky cave-in or larger boulder that has fallen or been placed to close. It looks to be one solid rock, yeah. At this point, the entrance is about four foot by two foot. And it's all blocked by one solid piece of rock.
Liam: Yeah. We're not getting through this. Hey. I'm not getting through this, you're not. Maybe Kiki can.
Laura: Do we see any other openings?
Matt: This would be a perception check.
Sam: Matt, my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way.
Marisha: That's what we're doing. While they do that, we're timing the steps out.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 20.
Matt: 20? Okay.
Taliesin: Ugh.
Marisha: Ugh.
Sam: 15.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: It's not that difficult to discern the pattern of the steps. The entirety of this titan shifts and quakes with each footfall, so it's pretty easy to find the pattern. It rarely changes, and you imagine any slight shift that you feel as they're going about this is because it's stepping on or through terrain that is not flat. But it is a pretty discernible pattern.
Taliesin: We could go have Grog smash it down in tempo with the steps so that the sound will be covered.
Travis: Like Shawshank Redemption and the poop pipe.
Taliesin: I was thinking of the Tainted Love Levi's commercial.
Laura: Do I see any other--
Matt: Not really. It mostly looks like loose rock and the more you glance about with each impacting footfall, you see two or three errant rocks go. You guys watch as more rocks tumble down the incline.
Laura: Maybe we need to do this quickly. This doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel. Hop on the broom, darling.
Taliesin: I like the idea of you punching this at the appropriate moment.
Marisha: It also saves me a 6th-level spell.
Travis: Well, that's what's most important. Are the Knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: And I would like to try and bash the shit out of this--
Taliesin: In tempo.
Laura: In tempo.
Matt: This is a tight tunnel for you. You have to crouch down, round your shoulders as you're doing it.
Travis: I'm going to do the one-inch punch.
Matt: Make an athletics check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Yeah, because I'm an angry monster. 21.
Matt: Okay. Here's the scenario  Vex and Vax, as you guys are on the broom in the tunnel, you look down and you know in Labyrinth, when the cleaner comes through the tunnel that fills the entirety of the space? You watch as this angry goliath starts up the tunnel towards you, and there does not appear to be much of any space you could squeeze through.
Liam: Is there a bubble at the top, maybe?
Laura: Grog?
Travis: What? (angry panting)
Laura: Can we pass under his legs or something?
Liam: Dive, dive!
Laura: Rage quietly.
Matt: You can both attempt to. Make an acrobatics check to attempt to squeeze between his legs.
Laura: At the same time? Acrobatics. 22.
Liam: 30-something.
Matt: It's not comfortable, but you both (popping) out the back, between his monstrous goliath thighs. From a backward perspective, those of you who are still waiting a little further down the tunnel from Vex: it's a unique sight, as the back end of your goliath friend suddenly gives birth to two half-elves. It's very Ace Ventura 2. However, you eventually climb your way angrily up to the very edge and there is the boulder, there, and you're about to go right towards it, but then stop and remember what your friends had said, and you wait patiently for the pattern of the next footfall. (boom)
Travis: (punch impact)
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Travis: Can I make it reckless-- oh, I didn't say it.
Laura: But you do extra damage because you're--
Travis: Oh, yeah, siege. Oh, it's fine. 30.
Matt: Yeah, all right, so roll 1d4 damage.
Travis: Okay, 1d4. Four!
Matt: Plus your strength modifier and your rage damage.
Travis: Eight. 27.
Matt: Whoa, wait, did you double it already?
Travis: No.
Matt: Wait, so it's four plus eight, 12.
Travis: And my rage damage is 15. Well, that's with the axe.
Matt: That's with the axe, yeah. No, that's your overall. So your rage damage at this level is four, because you just went up a level. So it's 12 plus four, so it's 16. So you do 32 points of bludgeoning damage with a single punch to this rock. With one hit, the entire boulder shifts and cracks, and you watch as part of it breaks away, and you see a brief glimmer of a dull light from the opposite side, as it rests back into place, heavily damaged.
Taliesin: (singing) Wait for it to go again and bump, bump, bump.
Matt: You wait for the next footfall of the titan (impact). You feel the impact and the shake. Do you want to go for another punch?
Travis: Do I hit it now?
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: Yes!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: Roll another attack.
Travis: Oh, that's even better. 33.
Matt: Easily enough. Go ahead and roll another d4.
Travis: Two plus eight. Ten plus--
Matt: Four for rage damage.
Travis: 14.
Matt: All right, and so with that, your fist slams into the boulder a second time. It explodes and shatters into hundreds of crumbled pieces of rock and stone goes firing across the distance of this tunnel, now revealing a little bit of flickering firelight. As you're sitting there seething with anger and your muscles and veins bulging with each breath--
Travis: I'm so swole right now.
Matt: Yeah. You can see above you, this entranceway opens up into a five-foot wide, ten-foot tall hallway that goes to the right and left. As you emerge, it goes a little bit to the right and front, and then to the back and behind you that direction.
Travis: Hey guys, it's a Z.
Laura: What do you see?
Travis: Let me find out. So I wiggle up a little more.
Marisha: So you know the first and last letter of the alphabet? Don't worry about it.
Matt: So you squeeze out of the small entrance way and step up into it. You can see now a well-constructed hallway. You can see there are stone slabs that are carved. The patterns and the angular architecture of this hall as it comes up into a trapezoid position. The hall comes in a bit, and the hallway rooftop is a flat, even surface. This is apparently a hall of dwarven make and seems to be a continuation of some sort of structure or pathway of Thomara.
Taliesin: Let the twins take a look. I think it would be safe.
Travis: It's a well-constructed hallway of dwarvish make. (groans)
Laura: We sneak under his legs again to like see what's going on.
Matt: You guys all eventually make your way up into this hallway. Now, it is still a five -foot-wide hallway, so you're still here in single-file progression one way or the other.
Liam: Twins are already at the top looking for problems.
Matt: Right, so you guys would be able to because it's a ten-foot-tall tunnel. You guys would be able to occupy a space above another party member if you were both on the broom.
Laura: Oh, should we be on the broom? No, you should be off the broom because you might check for traps. I'll check for traps along the wall and ceiling. And he's going to check for traps--
Liam: I'll take the lower half. That's called advantage.
Matt: So go ahead and make and investigation check.
Laura: Both of us or just him with advantage?
Matt: Both of you separately because you're investigating different elements of the hallway.
Liam: 18 for me.
Laura: Investigation? Natural fucking 20!
Matt: As you guys glance up and focus on the surrounding location. The hallway behind you goes for about 30 or so feet before it looks like a cave in. It looks like a mass of fully collapsed, broken stone. You can see bits of the hallway slabs that originally held up that part are collapsed inward and broken, left scattered across the ground. The other direction you go continues on and opens into a dark chamber about 60 feet ahead of you.
Laura: We should go toward the cave in, don't you think?
Matt: There are small built-in sconces that are magically, perpetually burning firelight.
Laura: Does this seem like there's any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the--?
Matt: You do not notice anything, as you were investigating specifically for that.
Taliesin: Check the sconces, see if they trigger something.
Laura: I'll look at the sconces.
Liam: I will look at the sconces.
Laura: I'll look at them better.
Matt: I included that as your perception for traps above. You did not notice anything that would be considered a trap.
Laura: You guys, there's no traps. We should head towards this darkened room.
Marisha: Save a life, check a sconce.
Liam: I'm going to creep about 40 feet down the hall and continue that search.
Matt: About 20 feet before this darkened chamber is there before you. As you get to the edge, you can see a little bit the very inside of this chamber. You can see a darkened brazier. It's your mind playing tricks on you. You thought you heard a raven.
Liam: Every day when I'm on the crapper, Matt. Everywhere.
Matt: A cold metallic brazier in the middle of the room. And that's as far as you can see into the chamber, before the edge of your visual range goes dark.
Taliesin: People don't install those unless there's something awful that needs to be done.
Marisha: Do we have any idea how far we've climbed?
Matt: You can make a nature check.
Liam: And do I need to make a extra roll to look for traps around this brazier?
Matt: If you want to enter the chamber, you can. You're too far away.
Marisha: Hey! Natural 20! That's a Gil 20!
Matt: As you take a moment, and think back to how far you've traveled path-wise and inclines and where you entered this titan and to where the city of Thar Amphala is placed upon its torso, you gather you're close to halfway through its torso, if not a little beyond it.
Marisha: If not a little beyond?
Sam: He's big.
Marisha: Okay, all right. Nipple level?
Matt: Sternum.
Marisha: The heartburn region? A little acid reflux?
Liam: We are the acid reflux.
Marisha: He has acid resistance against reflux.
Liam: Jesus Christ. Whoever that is.
Matt: You scoot up to the edge.
Liam: I don't want to go further than roughly 60 feet away from my sister.
Matt: Right. Which will put you right at the entryway to this chamber.
Liam: Yeah. So I will peep in from here.
Laura: I follow up and stand next to him. Did you want to go in?
Liam: I did.
Laura: Feel free.
Matt: So the marching order is the same? We got the twins up the front.
Taliesin: Yeah. I like this marching order.
Liam: Let this shit blow up in my face, so everybody hang back for a second. And I'm going to pitter patter in and look around the sconce, the room.
Laura: I think I was more stealthy than you a moment ago, so are you sure you want to be in front of me?
Liam: I love you anyway. Here I go.
Taliesin: He's better at blowing up than you are, dear.
Travis: Yeah. His heart beats once a century, so let him go.
Liam: Slower than this titan's footfalls.
Matt: All right. So as you enter the chamber, it's a small, about 20-foot radius square-shaped dark iron chamber with rounded corners. So it's about 40 feet wide from side to side, 20 feet from the center where the brazier is and the corners are slightly curved. It doesn't come to a straight, hard corner. There is no exit door currently visible; the chamber comes to an end. The room looks mostly bare, aside from an eight-foot-tall, five-foot-wide mirror coated in dust, framed in intricate gold and brass that sits across the chamber on the opposite side of where you entered.
Liam: Mirror in brass. So it's an iron room, right?
Matt: Iron room with a brass edge around this eight-foot tall, five-foot wide mirror. You can tell it's a mirror from this side. What little bit of light there is behind you, you can see your silhouette waving mirrored in the mirror.
Liam: So doorway, brazier, mirror.
Matt: Mirror. And then the rest of the chamber seems fairly empty.
Laura: And the brazier is complete dark?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: It's cold.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Laura: This is not good.
Liam: Look at his fake innocent face.
Sam: I think it's just a vanity.
Liam: Going to check for traps from right here to start. All right. That's totally fine. That's a jellyfish. That is a 17.
Matt: You begin to glance around the chamber, best you can, to take in the scenery. You notice small gold piece-sized buttons or pressure knobs set in the rounded corners of the chamber on the mirror side. One's embedded within the upper left and right corners and within the lower left and right corners.
Sam: Pressure knobs?
Matt: They're like little buttons that are gold piece-sized that are embedded in the upper right and left corners and the lower left and right corners.
Travis: Push them!
Liam: Stubby, come up here. I have a real bad history with pushing buttons.
Matt: You also notice very thin light piles of black residue or ash scattered in places across the floor.
Marisha: Called it. This is a fucking incinerator. I knew it! This feels like an incinerator. No? What? He's looking at me-- (nervous laughter)
Liam: (sighs) So we've got buttons.
Marisha: Or lasers.
Travis: Incinerator or lasers.
Marisha: Laser incinerator! Duh!
Travis: That was a great jump for me and my character.
Liam: If something stupid is going to happen here, I don't want it to be on me alone for once. So we've got an unlit brazier, there's mirror over there, and buttons, yeah.
Laura: Maybe the mirror is a door.
Liam: I thought that, as well.
Laura: Should we try to walk through it?
Taliesin: Maybe a second interrogation room and there's another room behind it, maybe?
Liam: Can we get your hub up here, please?
Taliesin: I am up here. I'm right here.
Liam: Jesus!
Laura: Hi, darling. I don't know why he didn't hear you. You used to be so good at that. Is the mirror leaning or is it on the wall?
Matt: It's on the wall.
Marisha: Is it curved? No. The whole room isn't curved. It's a square room.
Matt: It's a square room but the corners curve ever so slightly so there's no direct corner and in those curved corners on the side that the mirror's on, so the far side from you, there's these little buttons in the upper right and left corner and the lower left and right.
Laura: Can I reach down and touch the iron on the ground? The floor? Does it feel warm?
Matt: Mm. It's cold.
Liam: I catch her wrist. Just a second. You two do the thinking, all right? And I take a step into the room.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What do I do?
Laura: Go see if you can walk through the mirror.
Taliesin: Tap the mirror.
Travis: Light the brazier!
Laura: We've done that before and we all exploded.
Travis: Yeah, but it's Vax.
Marisha: Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some of the ashy stuff?
Matt: If you enter the chamber to, yeah.
Marisha: Hand me some ash. I'll test it.
Liam: I scoop some ash. Lady of the Grey Hunt, here. I scoop up some ash and I pour it into her hands.
Marisha: Okay. I do a nature check. What does this ash feel like it's made out of?
Sam: Human bones.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans)
Taliesin: Wow.
Laura: No. What is it? (groans)
Travis: Is it for real? You are lying!
Liam: Look at that face! You are not lying!
Marisha: Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil. I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe.
Matt: It's light ash. You're not sure what the basis of what may have burned here. You see more of it gathered near where the brazier is.
Taliesin: Is it in piles that would be about human-amount of ash?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: All right. I'll Gil this one. Yeah, natural 20. That'll do.
Sam: Only ones and 20s tonight.
Liam: That's it, yeah. Just quarters. Heads up, heads down.
Matt: More of it seems to be around the base of the brazier, but you do see there are thicker traces at different places throughout the chamber.
Taliesin: It's organic ash?
Matt: You've dealt with different types of ash. The carbon appears to have been organic-based at some point.
Liam: I pull off my belt and say  Hello, Simon. Wake him up.
Matt: Okay. (slithering)
Liam: Hi. Gosh, it's been a while.
Laura: Simon, go through the mirror.
Liam: That's right. Go check out the mirror, Simon, all right? Off you go.
Travis: Are we still in the room?
Laura: No, nobody's in the room. He's the only one in the room.
Matt: (slithering) Scoots over and heads up to the mirror and presses up against it.
Liam: I dart back one step out of the room as it happens.
Matt: The snake trying to push up against the wall but half of its body sliding against the mirror before it eventually scoots off and lands. It tries again, pushing against the mirror and then eventually (sliding).
Taliesin: I hate to say this, but tap the button?
Liam: That's on the list. Simon, buddy. Crawl up the brazier. Wrap around it. Go up to the top.
Matt: The snake slithers around and makes its way. It's a cross-metal cage. There are inch wide metal bars that all curl up like a basket and then there are bars that cross around it to hold the shape. It looks like there are some long-burned, blackened pieces of wood that have been left for a long time. So Simon curls up into the brazier and curls up around the metal, comes around the top of the outer rim of it, rests there.
Liam: There's two buttons low down. Oh man. The nostalgia here. All right, buddy. I take two steps back away from the door. Buddy buds. Will you go push those low buttons in the room?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: There's two, right?
Matt: There's four on the opposite side.
Liam: There's two high up. And I don't think he can reach the high, because he doesn't stick to walls. Get the one over here on the left first.
Laura: What if we all have to push every button at the same time?
Liam: That's true. That could be.
Matt: Simon (slithering) moves over.
Liam: I lean over to Percy, I say  science!
Matt: Hits the button. (click) Right on the entrance of where you are in the chamber, slams closed. Iron metal now closes off that entranceway.
Taliesin: I'm going to touch the door.
Sam: And say goodbye.
Taliesin: Simon, we barely knew him. Is it warm?
Matt: It is beginning to get warm.
Taliesin: It's an oven. I'm looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on the outside of the door.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: Is Vax in the room?
Liam: No, I took two steps back from the door.
Laura: No, nobody's in the room.
Taliesin: Let's say that investigation was somewhere around a seven? (laughter)
Matt: It's pretty solid at this point. The walls that lean in towards the ceiling there-- it is a perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the entrance.
Travis: No problem. I'll get it down.
Laura: No!
Liam: Wait. Simon is technically a magical item, so I don't think he would be harmed by anything going on in there, so why don't we give it five minutes?
Marisha: And maybe it'll open again.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Is there anything going on in the tunnel, on the outside of this door, where we are?
Laura: Coming up from behind us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Temperature check, anything like that? Natural 20.
Taliesin: We have been gone so long!
Matt: Gone for two weeks and you guys can't find middle math. It's only extremes.
Liam: Yeah, we've had blue balls for two weeks, and it's all coming out now.
Matt: So as you guys glance back in the shadow of the tunnel behind you, nothing seems to be catching your eye. It's still dark. About two minutes in, what was once dark metal is now giving a slight orangish hue. You can feel the heat emanating from it.
Travis: There's no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right now, right?
Matt: I'd say, because of your perception check, as you glance around, there does not appear to be any ash.
Travis: I don't want that door to fucking open all of a sudden.
Matt: About five minutes go by as you guys are waiting. Eventually, the iron wall begins to descend. The dull orangish glow of it is still there. As it opens, a wave of heated air emerges from the chamber. You all have to immediately close your eyes. Some of you instinctually begin to step further back into the hallway. On the inside of the room, you can see the black iron interior of the chamber is also that same orangish glow. The mirror is unscathed. You all step back and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly begins to cool off, the metal slowly darkening. You're too far away to look. You make a perception check to try and glance in?
Laura: Can't you call to him?
Liam: Simon? Come here, buddy.
Matt: There's no response.
Liam: (gasps) He's a magical item! Oh, but he could have turned back into a belt.
Taliesin: What's he going to say if you call to him? Was he going to say something?
Liam: He would come to me, Percy! Jeepers creepers! Perception check? 29!
Matt: You glance past where the button was that it hit. You see a limp belt left on the ground.
Liam: Okay, I'll get that in a minute.
Laura: When you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist.
Matt: Technically, since Simon's taken enough damage to revert to the belt form, Simon cannot turn back into a snake for the day.
Laura: How about that unseen servant?
Liam: I'm thinking, having no knowledge of magic, that we either want to somehow push all four of these buttons at once, as my sister said, or light this brazier, or both.
Laura: What about the brazier? Is it cold? Does it look like it's hot?
Sam: The brazier's the source of the furnace, I assume.
Travis: Are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it?
Matt: The pieces are still there, but it's black carbon. There's nothing in there that could burn. Whatever's been in there has been heated so much to the point--
Travis: It's not the source of the flame. Not for that much heat.
Marisha: If I was the person who designed this, why would I put a failsafe in here?
Liam: A way to get through that only the creator would know how to use?
Marisha: I feel like there's got to be another entrance because we can see another room, right?
Laura: There's no other room, it's a mirror. Oh, Keyleth, that's our reflection.
Marisha: No, I know that, but a lot of things have reflections.
Liam: Listen, all of you, or I, are going to be dead very soon. Are you sure you want to be that sarcastic right now?
Marisha: I go up to the mirror and check it out. It's cooled off enough, right?
Matt: Well, no. If you guys want to take a few minutes, you can wait until it cools off, if you want to.
Taliesin: Why don't we try pushing all four buttons at once?
Sam: Wait, before we do that, I'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling.
Matt: Okay, I take it you wait until it cools off. It takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully cool off, to the point where it's comfortable.
Sam: I'm looking for markings, indications of instructions, arrows, any hidden words--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Look for Dwarvish. I'm aces with that.
Sam: Ooh, a lot. 29.
Taliesin: He's coming up with some bullshit.
Matt: Okay. Because the room is not fully cooled off, it's still warm in there, somewhat. You glance through. The ceiling and the walls all appear to be solid iron, and there's a layer of dust across a lot of it, a bit of ash from whatever previously may have been incinerated in here, long ago. As you look from the opposite side of the room into the reflection of the mirror, you see a very faint orangish glow in the reflection. It looks like, in the upper corner and the lower corner of the opposite side of the mirror as you're glancing off across to the other side. As you look over to the wall, of the room you're in, there's no glow.
Sam: Wait, so the wall that we came in through?
Matt: Let's say you enter the chamber and you move to the corner immediately to your right. You look in the mirror at an angle. You're now seeing the reflection of the corner opposite to you, right? Looking in that reflection, you can see this very faint orange glow in the upper and lower corner, but you glance over to the physical corner across from you, and it's not there.
Laura: What do your gnomish eyes see, Scanlan?
Sam: I think there's magical buttons in here and we need to find them? So I'm going to look in the mirror. I go to the opposite corner and do the same thing.
Matt: As you have this conversation and look back, those two glowing sigils are gone.
Sam: Even in the mirror?
Matt: Even in the mirror. What you saw earlier is now gone.
Travis: But they're revealed by heat.
Marisha: Where were they?
Sam: They were upper and lower corner, yeah.
Marisha: I walk over and I heat them with my heat hands.
Matt: Okay, so you take your hands and you put them up near there. As you put your hands on the wall, nothing seems to happen. As you glance through the reflection where she has her hands, that symbol seems to be appearing again.
Laura: What is the symbol of?
Sam: It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it?
Matt: It looks to be a simple triangular symbol, marked in a circle. Make an arcana check.
Sam: Oh yeah. 14 plus six, that's 20.
Matt: It's the most basic of arcane marks. It's a variation on a spell that basically is a mark that a certain enchanter or somebody places to mark as their own. However, this is meant to be a basic marker, a visual draw. There's no language behind it. It's just an indicator.
Sam: Keyleth, do that same thing to the lower one. Same marking?
Matt: As you head down there, the one above begins to slowly fade. As her hands go there, the symbol appears below.
Sam: Same symbol? Let's do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones.
Matt: As you guys reverse, opposite sides, you go to the other corners, the ones that were immediately toward the entrance of where you walked in. Sure enough, two more symbols, mirroring where the buttons are on the far side corners.
Sam: So we push those? But there's a hidden button in there.
Travis: When you're a big fire, the walking thing--
Marisha: A fire elemental.
Travis: Sure. Do you take damage from fire? So you should be in here.
Laura: You should go in there, see if you can disengage the trap.
Liam: So you are impervious to being set on fire or burned?
Marisha: Well, when I'm a fire elemental.
Laura: Can you do that?
Marisha: Can I do it right now? Yeah. I just took a short rest, so yes, I can do that.
Travis: We also have an unseen servant.
Sam: So we're going to need four people.
Marisha: So what's the end goal? What am I doing?
Liam: Press all four buttons at once, although we've got at least three sharpshooters--
Sam: Not the buttons that we can see. What are these symbols here? I think they're buttons, as well.
Travis: It might be a depression on the wall or something.
Marisha: But what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols?
Taliesin: Let's try pushing all four buttons.
Travis: The regular buttons or the magic ones?
Liam: Please stand by.
Laura: I want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button.
Marisha: Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's nothing there, right?
Sam: Was there anything there?
Matt: You put your hand on there. Nothing. The wall doesn't move.
Marisha: It's just a wall.
Travis: No depression, no toggle?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: I've got this, you guys. Oh! Minus two. 17!
Matt: 17. Grog, as you step up and glare down at the place where Keyleth had placed her palm, you get frustrated and (sighs heavily). As you exhale, it looks like a bit of soot and ash that had been slowly drifting in and filling this space flutters away. You can see two lines, parallel to each other, about an inch tall.
Travis: Fifth Element, anyone? Oh look! Breath of Grog reveals all! Look, behold! Two. Lines.
Laura: What did you do?
Travis: I breathed on the wall.
Sam: What do they do? What do these lines do?
Marisha: I do a quick Gust cantrip.
Matt: Across the parallel lines? All right. As the wind blows across it, a lot more of the soot and the ash blows around the area. It creates an open space where it pushes out to the edges and darkens areas of the floor and the vicinity around Keyleth. That edge of that corner, where you blew the Gust cantrip that Grog had unfurled, is now clear, the iron revealed. Nothing beyond the two.
Laura: I fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go (blowing).
Matt: Okay. So up there. You blow on that one and it looks like--
Marisha: Hang on, I've got a paper ready.
Liam: How many people at home do you think have figured this out already?
Laura: We already figured it out!
Sam: Wait, you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols?
Laura: Yeah, to clear them out!
Travis: If you're looking at the door we came in, Grog blew on the lower right?
Sam: And that's two lines. Boom.
Matt: That would be lower right.
Travis: Two vertical lines.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: I'm in the corner above Grog.
Matt: That would be upper right.
Taliesin: I'm going to do bottom left.
Matt: All right, you blow, and you watch as the dust reveals. It's two more lines.
Laura: Two lines? Shit. I thought it was going to be another--
Taliesin: Bottom left. Getting out a hanky and (blows).
Liam: Did you use your ascot?
Taliesin: Yes, of course. That's what it's there for. The back of it.
Laura: The one clean spot left on it.
Matt: That one has four parallel lines.
Laura: Ooh! I'll go into the corner above Percy. There was a reflection there, too, right?
Sam: Blow! Laura, blow!
Laura: (blows) I looked straight at the camera as I did it. It was really awkward.
Matt: All right, that one has a single line.
Sam: Wait, so we've got one, two, two, four?
Laura: Is there one with three lines, or are there any more areas we saw a reflection?
Travis: What about above the door? It is opposite of the mirror, right? If one's a door, and the other one's a door?
Laura: Okay, I'll blow above the door.
Liam: And I'm going to start blowing around the mirror.
Laura: We all walk around going (raspberries).
Travis: Constitution check to see who passes out first?
Matt: What was that?
Taliesin: Does the mirror have a fancy frame?
Matt: It's not extremely intricate, but it looks like there's a brass or bronze frame around it.
Taliesin: Are any of these symbols mirrored in the frame itself? Is there a mirror of any of these symbols in the frame?
Matt: As you look in the actual frame itself, you don't see anything that matches the symbols.
Laura: What if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons?
Sam: Except we have two twos, and no three?
Laura: I know. One, two, four!
Taliesin: No, because you have to hit one, and then you have to hit the two together--
Sam: And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can we do a sweep for more?
Travis: Can I clear off the door area that we walked through?
Matt: So Grog, you go through, (rapid blowing). Blowing around. Okay. Make an investigation check.
Marisha: I take my mantle and start doing a--
Matt: You clear that archway very well, around the door. You do reveal Dwarven runes on the upper right corner, upper left corner, lower right, and lower left corner of the doorframe.
Travis: I only know Dwarven writing. I don't know runes.
Matt: Well, the runes are part of the Dwarven language.
Travis: The runes are part of the Dwarven language, so I know them.
Laura: Pike goes over and she helps you.
Travis: Help me, Pike! Yeah, I would like to decipher what these symbols mean.
Laura: "If you lift me up, I could see the ones above the door!"
Liam: "Yeah, the last time I wanted you to do it on your own, but I think we're pressed for time."
Travis: I hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway.
Matt: Okay, so turning around, upper left corner. Okay. That one is the Dwarven rune that represents the number three.
Travis: Three. All right. Now, to the upper right-hand corner.
Matt: That is the number one.
Travis: Okay. I put her on the ground and I say, okay, look at the lower right-hand corner.
Matt: So lower right-hand corner would be a two.
Travis: And now the lower left-hand corner.
Matt: A four.
Laura: Oh, yeah! We know! That's the amount of times you have to push the button!
Taliesin: So one-one, two-two-two-two, three, four-four.
Sam: Possibly.
Laura: Wait, I think we reversed it.
Liam: How long does your unseen servant last?
Sam: Not too long.
Liam: How long? An hour? Ten minutes?
Sam: I'll look in my memory. One hour, but I have to be close to it. How big is this room?
Matt: It's a 20-foot radius from the center of the brazier, so it's 40 feet on each side.
Taliesin: Is our physicality of this map correct? If we show you this?
Liam: Well, I have this jar. It's an oil of etherealness. You could potentially be standing in here, but not be in here. Lasts an hour, though. Same time gap as your friend. You could stand in here and not be in here.
Sam: From the doorway to the mirror, is it less than 60 feet?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, then I can be out of the door. Am I right with what I wrote down there?
Matt: All right, so this is the-- facing from the inside--
Sam: Yeah, from the brazier-- Frasier Crane. Looking at the door that we came in. Right?
Matt: I'm going to have to draw you one. I think you guys got confused on that one.
Laura: I think me and Travis got it right.
Sam: I think, Matt, you're wrong.
Travis: I have the same thing as Laura.
Liam: I'm pretty sure it's up up down down left right left right A B A B.
Laura: I hope we passed the test.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Did we get it right?
Matt: There, that's what you get! Sorry, I'm limited in my reach right now.
Marisha: I love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different. We're like, numbers, somewhere!
Matt: Yep, almost. Almost.
Marisha: Did you help us, or are you just saying "almost?"
Matt: I'm saying, looking back and seeing where the numbers lie and the runes in there, you have the correct configuration.
Laura: (victorious laughter)
Marisha: I think this is right. I think you have this. I think I have the right part of this and you have the right part of this.
Laura: We'll copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct.
Travis: Yes.
Laura: No, this is wrong. I'm just going to draw it. (counting)
Sam: Guys, Shadow of War! It's a great game by-- I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers!
Laura: Okay, so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons.
Sam: Yes, so now we've just got to do it.
Travis: Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame?
Taliesin: I gave it a little bit of a rub.
Marisha: I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror.
Matt: Okay. It taps.
Travis: Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: Three. You smear a bit of ash, but eventually get some semblance of shine through. Nothing catches your eye.
Travis: It's clear. We found everything there is to find.
Marisha: Grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash.
Sam: All right, should we leave the room and have Mr. Invisible start tapping buttons? All right, we'll do that.
Laura: We step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons.
Liam: (singing) Scanlan Man, Scanlan Man. Does whatever a Scanlan can. Makes a guy, pushes buttons, Scanlan Man-- I'm out.
Taliesin: Look out!
Liam: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Marisha: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Taliesin: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Sam: Would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Shit.
Travis: Well, there's no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly.
Liam: Also, what about shooting the button or firing an arrow at a button?
Laura: Yeah but the buttons are on this side.
Taliesin: How high up are the buttons?
Matt: The buttons? The top are about ten feet up.
Taliesin: So if he had something that was-- if he had a mop, basically, he could probably tap it.
Laura: The buttons are on the side of the mirror, so we could shoot arrows at them.
Taliesin: But only if we're in there and then we don't need an unseen servant to do it.
Sam: Want to give him a pole or something?
Taliesin: Let's give him a stick.
Sam: Do we have a stick in the bag?
Travis: I have a lance.
Taliesin: Yeah, he has a lance.
Travis: It's almost broken.
Taliesin: My god, it will finally be useful one last time.
Liam: We do have three trammels.
Taliesin: No! We are not disengaging a smoke alarm with a fucking trammel. There is a limit!
Travis: You have a slightly splintered lance.
Laura: Okay. Let's hit buttons. Let's do it! Let's get through this room.
Taliesin: Let's explain to the unseen servant what he's supposed to do.
Sam: Matt, can he hold a lance, or is that violating some-- he's not allowed to hold weapons.
Matt: He can hold them. He can't attack; he cannot be a combatant. It can hold things for you.
Liam: He's like a Kids in the Hall character.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. You're not wrong.
Sam: I conjure an unseen servant, whom I will name Simon Two.
Taliesin: Electric Boogaloo.
Liam: Not cool, man, not cool.
Matt: All right. There's this brief shimmer, and you watch as a bit of ash displaces on the ground where two footfalls (landing noises).
Sam: All right, Simon Two, take this lance. We're going to go tell you what buttons to press over there, good speed-- good speed? (laughter)
Sam: Godspell. You'll be fine. Hope you don't like burning alive. So you tell me what to tell him, because I don't have the paper. Upper left? Upper right? What do we start with?
Marisha: It's this. Tell him to do this.
Laura: The reflection of that.
Sam: Okay, so two upper right. Two pokes. Oh, wait.
Laura: So the upper left corner from where we're looking.
Sam: Yes, we're going to go mirror image of this, so project that across the room.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, that was the mistake.
Matt: Okay, so pressing the upper left twice.
Sam: Yes, mirror image of this, so upper left. Let's try that.
Matt: Heads over, holding the lance. You watch the lance wobble, and it misses a couple times, (clicking) hits the button, and it clicks inward. The lance is pulled back and the button presses back out outward into its position.
Sam: Any door?
Matt: No door.
Laura: We'll know if we push it again then we did it the wrong order.
Matt: Second time, (clicking) pulls off, the button depresses.
Taliesin: All right, keep going.
Sam: So below it, two presses.
Laura: In the corner, bottom corner.
Sam: Just like your name, Simon  two.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: Okay, opposite corner, up. One press.
Laura: Upper right-hand corner.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: And then below that, bottom corner. Four presses.
Matt: (clicking) (laughter)
Matt: The fourth one hits. There's a moment of pause, and the mirror shimmers faintly. You watch as, almost like a stone thrown into the middle of a still pond, begins to ripple from the center, and as it ripples, each ripple seems to fade, until eventually the five-foot-wide mirror is now an oval portal that leads to darkness behind it.
Laura: Let's go in!
Marisha: I told you there was a room behind the mirror.
Travis: Yeah, let's go. Hurry! We don't know how long it will stay open for.
Sam: Simon Two is coming with us.
Matt: Okay. You hear the faint footfalls of sound behind, and Trinket takes a moment to try and squeeze through this small entranceway. Trinket had a hard enough time getting through the incline. (moans) Into the necklace. You make your way through the opposite side, and as you all step through, the portal remains open for at least a moment.
Laura: Hey, we did it, guys.
Sam: We beat a door.
Travis: We beat a door.
Marisha: Guys, it took 111 episodes, but we bested a door.
Liam: The last episode of the third campaign will be a door that we do not open.
Matt: So the darkness you step through leads into a ten-foot-wide hallway of similar dwarven stone. Same slightly angled hallways about ten feet tall or so, about five or six foot wide. You get a few steps in and about 20 or 30 seconds after you guys make your way in, the mirror portal behind closes up.
Liam: Can we see?
Marisha: Can you see through it?
Matt: Through the mirror?
Liam: I meant where we are. Are we in pitch black?
Matt: You're in pitch black, but you guys with darkvision can see there is a staircase not too far, maybe ten feet from where you stand into this next hallway.
Travis: Iron stairs? Stone stairs?
Matt: Stone stairs.
Liam: I've got a dagger out.
Matt: All right, lights up briefly and you get a little bit of a vision beyond that, and it's gradual stone steps. They're not too wide; they're made for dwarven gait, so there are many steps that are relatively shallow.
Travis: These are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow.
Sam: We can see it, Grog.
Liam: Pike says, "That's actually right".
Laura: Is there any traps?
Matt: You're welcome to search for traps.
Liam: And I'm going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs and look as I go for traps. One. I'm taking it, but I'm still going and looking for traps.
Matt: You do have reliable talent, don't forget.
Liam: Does that oversee ones? Because I've been counting ones as ones for a long time.
Matt: The reliable talent as a rogue specifically says any roll lower than a ten you take as a ten.
Sam: Any roll?
Matt: Well, not any roll. Any ability check he has to make.
Liam: Okay, well, we wrongly assumed that ones and 20s were king, but no.
Laura: So he rolled way better than me because I rolled a ten.
Liam: That's an 18. My one is an 18 now.
Matt: Yeah, because that's one of the cool things about rogues. You guys make your way up about 45, 50 or so feet up the stairway, you keeping an eye out, no traps, nothing catches your eye as iffy or strange, and the stairs now switch back into another set. It's a small landing and then it continues upward.
Liam: Okay, but I'm only going to go 40 feet in advance. That's like ten fucked rolls of mine from the past 30 games! Anyway, I love it.
Marisha: So it's a big 180, going right up?
Matt: Yeah, it's a switchback. The staircase ascends, then there's a landing, and it continues upward and around.
Laura: Do we hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join in that perception.
Matt: So you're joining them up the staircase?
Taliesin: I'm behind. You know, the standard--
Matt: All right, so you guys are keeping up.
Marisha: Did you fuck the roll, too? Oh, what the fuck!
Taliesin: I got a 25.
Matt: Seriously, welcome back after two weeks and people just cannot-- wow.
Liam: But do you remember when we were at home and we'd go six weeks without playing and we'd spend 45 minutes trying to remember what we did, how the rules worked, what our names were, who you were.
Taliesin: Vex is right.
Travis: 25, you said?
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay. It's hard to discern what shifting in the distance is not the rumbling from the ever-occasional titan footfalls, but nothing seems to catch your attention. Occasionally, you hear dislodged rocks and stones clacking across the stone floor and the steps, and every now and then you catch a stone or two fall past and eventually come to rest either near or below you. You continue up the switchback stairs and lead into a third switchback that continues upward.
Liam: 40 feet in advance.
Marisha: We are following behind.
Laura: Are you looking for traps as you go, brother?
Liam: I am. That is an 18, anyway.
Marisha: I still have my hands guiding Percy, our blind human.
Matt: Leading the old man forward.
Taliesin: (old man voice) Where's Steven?
Marisha: (laughs) Where's Steven?
Matt: You do not find any other traps. There's no other issues that worry you upon this climb. You do eventually come to the top of the third switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight curved cavern. The stairs stop and it leads into a continuation of the dwarf-like hallway structure that you had below, but it is curving around now, in sections. I would say, as opposed to a gradual curve, the design in the structure here has a very rigid, geometric shape, so the curvature is in sections.
Liam: Yeah, I appreciate it as I go, and I look for traps.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Love it. That's an 18.
Matt: Okay. Coming around the edge  no traps, no plates. Nothing catches your attention. However, this tunnel comes to an end, and it opens up into a larger crevasse than the one that you previously saw that held a number of city buildings of the remains of Thomara. It looks to be about 100 to 120 feet tall, you assume, from the bits of the stalactites that you can see, barely reaching the edge of your visual range. Very faint bit of light here, bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish color that dots the edges of this interior chamber.
Liam: And is it like where I killed that motherfucker? They were built into the cliff face, right?
Matt: Yes. This one is larger than the one you were in before, and you can see just beyond your visual range, a number of these buildings, partially crumbled in some places, some still standing obstinately against the ever-shifting interior of the titan's form, the chamber curling upward as the ceiling crawls higher and higher just beyond your visual range, and you can faintly see the images of dozens of thin bridges that weave over themselves across different levels, up into the higher portion.
Liam: I want to confirm an intuition and use my last Divine Sense and feel undead.
Matt: Okay, what's the range on that one?
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet? You do not sense any undead within the 60-foot range.
Marisha: I think we're in the lungs. I think we're in its chest cavity.
Liam: Speaking into the earrings; they're all behind me. I think we're in a more populous place with the undead cannibals, know what I mean? There's a very large cavern in here and a lot of room.
Taliesin: I'd be grateful if anyone got a sample of that bioluminescent fungus.
Marisha: I can get that. I'm interested.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up and get some?
Liam: We're on a schedule here.
Marisha: Well, if it's on the way. We have to go that way.
Laura: We have to go up, right? Does it look like there's openings in the ceiling?
Matt: Well currently you're the only one who's stepped into this entrance to look up, the rest of you are now exiting into the chamber.
Liam: I'll wait, obviously. Nothing's going to explode on my friends, so they catch up with me.
Matt: Okay, so they're all behind you now where this entrance is, and as you look past it, this hallway that you're entering, it looks like there was a doorway here. There was some sort of hinge on the edge that held a door that had since been broken or toppled forward. You can see pieces of the door that once held this entranceway, and a number of the buildings immediately to the right and left. That's where you stand, what do you want to do?
Laura: Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole?
Liam: Everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Not in a long time.
Travis: Is there shattered remnants of the door?
Matt: Yeah, you see a couple of shards here and there--
Travis: Any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the ground or anything?
Matt: Make an investigation check. Lot of investigation checks today.
Travis: Two.
Matt: You scramble about and find a couple of pieces that might be, but no, it's just more stone.
Marisha: Can I see any stairs carved in the side, in the walls, trying to head up to this-- is that what you just checked?
Laura: No, that's what I was about to look for, too.
Liam: Is there any movement, because there's bioluminescent shit on the walls in here, so there's a little bit of light, right? Yeah. 26.
Matt: 26. As you glance about-- once again, your vision, because there is very little light in here and the very, very faint bits of fungus in the distance that give you a sense of the shape of this entire chamber. There isn't enough light for you to make out any shape beyond the exterior of your visual range, so you can't really tell.
Liam: A second thing I want to look for is what other exits from this gigantic cavern. Ways through, up. Yeah, you looked, but I didn't look.
Matt: Let me finish what I was saying first.
Travis: Roll! Roll again.
Matt: But based on the size of this chamber and the bits of what small elements of structures that you can see of the architecture within, this definitely appears to be more of the heart of the city of Thomara when it was once at its ancient height. You can see at the very edge of your visual range a cracked central fountain that is empty and dry, and you see, just beyond your range, the exterior of a large temple-like building that rises out of the ability to see any more of its height and structure.
Taliesin: Temple.
Matt: But like I said, you guys are still standing at the entrance to this cavern.
Marisha: What about the temple? Why?
Sam: Want to fly through here? Can we fly?
Liam: I don't think we want to stay here--
Sam: I know, that's why we just fly through.
Liam: Find another exit, yeah, but where?
Travis: I'd like to see the temple, if I can.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Travis: Well look, all right, my gloves--
Laura: Keep your voice down.
Travis: (whispering) My gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan. So if maybe they harvested pieces of my gloves, and it's in a temple, I don't know, you smart people could do something with that.
Liam: Right, what's your plan? You expect us to come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are connected to that temple, and you're going to get what? A Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bonus for doing so?
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Are your Titanstone Knuckles exalted yet?
Travis: Yep. They're just buzzing.
Liam: Yeah, are they still dildoing on your fingers?
Marisha: Are they buzzing more?
Travis: Are they humming more?
Matt: Doesn't appear to have changed.
Travis: Nope, just humming.
Marisha: Step two steps closer.
Travis: Two steps closer to the temple.
Marisha: Do they appear to be buzzing more?
Travis: Are they appearing buzzing more?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Ooh! 19.
Matt: Not bad. Nope.
Taliesin: Is the temple on the way? Does it make sense to cross through the city, or does it make sense to fly up?
Liam: We're moving towards Vasselheim now. I'm negative on our chances of dealing with this before Vasselheim, but that's the goal, right?
Taliesin: We've got some time, and I feel like this city is an opportunity to find some more advantages.
Travis: We are also looking for the Sword of Kas. What's if it's in the temple?
Sam: Why would Vecna keep the thing that could kill Vecna near Vecna?
Liam: I'm pulling Percy aside. I hear you, but this is a city that has existed here for a long time. Vecna didn't create this city. Vecna doesn't own these people. This is a fucking mountain that existed and now they're going for a ride. What do these people have to do with Vecna?
Taliesin: It's not a city that just existed.
Liam: No?
Taliesin: This is a giant primordial beast that people inhabited. God only knows what existed in here.
Marisha: Yeah, but as we've already seen from the other tomb, it's already been heavily, heavily plundered.
Liam: And Vecna's just a user. This place was just sitting there. He lifted it up and took it away. These assholes don't have anything to do with--
Travis: Why did he choose this?
Marisha: How far away is the temple? Do we know? Can we football range guess it?
Matt: I'd say, because you guys have darkvision of 60 feet?
Taliesin: If gods really understood how this world worked, this would not be happening right now.
Matt: It's at about the 50, 55 foot areas where the wall begins, then it vanishes beyond that.
Liam: Percy, this shitbird has appeared like three times wherever we were.
Laura: Well, he's not going to be able to do that right now because I've got a fucking ring.
Taliesin: He doesn't necessarily know this place as well as--
Marisha: Hang on. How long have we been in here, versus how far have we been from Vasselheim? Because we are on a time crunch.
Travis: 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from Vasselheim. 200 miles. With steps of?
Taliesin: What was the average land speed of a laden undead?
Matt: You've been within the titan for, I'd say, roughly three and a half hours, maybe.
Liam: Yeah, he's 110 miles out from Vasselheim, at this point.
Travis: We have time to check the temple.
Sam: All right, let's swoop in and swoop out.
Marisha: Super fucking fast!
Taliesin: I'm not even saying look in it, let's take a look at what it--
Laura: Did I see any stairs?
Matt: You do not see any staircases within a 60-foot radius of where you're standing.
Taliesin: We might be harder to spot if we stay on the ground for now, anyway.
Marisha: I just want to say, we gave you guys the other temple, in which you found your stupid waistband, but we got really fucked up from it! Everything has a consequence and a price and shit. Nothing is free.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a fucking Trace. It's my last Pass Without a Trace, but I'm afraid--
Travis: No, don't do it.
Laura: What if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us?
Marisha: Let me do it. I have Pass Without a Trace and one more 2nd-level spell left. I'll do it. Save yours.
Liam: I'm also going to put something on the table here: we're trying to save Vasselheim, but we're also trying to save the world. We might not be able to do this without recharging before Vasselheim.
Taliesin: I'm aware.
Sam: You want to go to sleep in this undead city?!
Liam: No, but we're trying to save the world, not just a city.
Sam: So sacrificing Vasselheim so that we can feel better about a fight?
Liam: What if we lose the fight Scanlan? Then who fucking cares? Vasselheim is gone. Westruun is gone. Kaylie is gone. Everything's fucking gone if we fuck this up!
Sam: Well, let's stay on the path and see how long it takes.
Marisha: How about this? Hold. Wait! We still don't know how to get up there, right?
Sam: Is that purple eyeliner?
Marisha: Yeah, do you like it? Thank you. It's a little metallic. Thank you, I bought it while I was waiting for--
Travis: Oh my god!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: Okay. I hate to say split the party, but what if we split the party? What if a few of you check out your fucking temple, and then the rest of us try to figure out a way to get up.
Travis: I'm cool. I'll vote for a temple party.
Marisha: Temple party. Who else is on temple party?
Sam: They need somebody who can help them in there.
Liam: I hate the idea, but I'm the stealthiest motherfucker in this room.
Taliesin: And then you three on the carpet, you on the broom.
Travis: I need the carpet.
Marisha: So wait, just the two of you are going to go check out the carpet?
Laura: Vax is going in with you.
Sam: I feel like one person with magic should go with them. I'll go with them.
Taliesin: We're all ear-pieced.
Marisha: Okay, so Grog--
Liam: Everybody but Keyleth.
Sam: No, it's Keyleth, Vex, and Pike are going searching. The boys are going in the temple, and the girls are going searching.
Marisha: Okay, cool, I'm on board.
Taliesin: This is in no way, by the way, an amazing mirror of that one time underneath Kraghammer. They're just going to find another Clarota.
Liam: The boys all die. The girls go to glory.
Laura: I want to kiss Percy before he goes. Don't die in this stupid temple.
Taliesin: I will not die in this stupid temple.
Sam: I'm going, too.
Taliesin: I slap him in the face.
Laura: Right on, Scanlan. Sorry, Percy.
Matt: Who's traveling in what group?
Laura: Girls are going to look for stairs, the boys are going in the stupid temple.
Liam: I yank the druid in for a kiss.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh wait, shit. Your fucking ring.
Laura: Fuck! My fucking ring! We can't split the party.
Taliesin: Okay, can't split the party. We all go looking for the stairs. Oh, you asshole, stop it! (laughter)
Laura: He was really excited about it!
Matt: I was waiting on that.
Laura: Oh my god, he was so excited about it.
Sam: All right, into the temple. Come on, let's just fucking go to the fucking temple.
Matt: I was like, you guys literally had this conversation an hour ago, but okay.
Taliesin: Whatever we do, we can't split the party (fast-forward noise). Okay, we're going to split the party.
Travis: Sam saved our asses.
Taliesin: That was Cabin in the Woods shit.
Liam: 40 feet in advance, Vax walks ahead of the group, hating himself. Here we go.
Matt: Go for it. What are you doing, you're checking for traps?
Liam: I'm checking for enemies hiding.
Matt: So as you push forward--
Laura: We're stealthed, we're Pass Without a Traced.
Matt: Okay, then roll some stealth, guys.
Laura: She Pass Without a Traced us.
Matt: Right, then roll some stealth.
Sam: Oh, we're all rolling stealth?
Liam: 34.
Sam: 25.
Taliesin: 26.
Marisha: 26.
Laura: 39.
Travis: Natural one.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Sam: He's so excited about that temple.
Laura: Natural 20 for Pike! Oh wait, she gets disadvantage.
Matt: She has the boots that make it not at disadvantage.
Taliesin: First time ever.
Liam: But that's a lot of good.
Laura: So much good for one shitty--
Matt: You begin to push forward past the cracked fountain, heading ahead of everyone, keeping an eye out for what's ahead of you. The high walls of the temple-like structure begin to reveal themselves, standing ominous over the debris-strewn streets with shattered carts and bone fragments. The bone fragments faintly quaking beneath every footfall of the walking mountain that you currently are walking through. You see long-decomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond reanimation lying scattered across the broken street paths ahead of you, deep grooves marking the splintered bone. A tangled network of partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal themselves above you, carved from the mountain, contains a ghostly image of a multi-level metropolis long fallen. You, make a perception check.
Liam: 29.
Matt: 29. You can see, as soon as you get to where the fountain is, the center of the street ahead of you. Dozens of slow shifting creatures moving throughout the streets and rubble of crumbling structures. You can see now, many of the undead citizens of the catacombs are now wandering, shaken awake by the lumbering titan that now carries them within. You also see a very faint blue pulsing glow emanating from one of the windows of the temple.
Liam: Can we put the goliath on the carpet so he doesn't kick something or be himself?
Laura: We don't know that he rolled shittily.
Liam: I know that, but he's a big, blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be--
Travis: On the chain. Literally on the text chain.
Matt: Which, as you're saying this, you hear a (clattering), and you glance over real fast and watch as Grog is walking by and the edge of his-- which weapon do you have attuned right now? You have the Blood Axe? The Blood Axe hits the edge of a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a corner angle and is currently being held by a small barrel, and as the axe hits it, it shifts (crashing) and rolls and comes to a rest for a second with this clattering, grinding sound. Parts of it chip and break, but most of it remains strong and sturdy upon impact. At which point, you see at the edge of your visual range, about seven of the wandering creatures go (raspy groan) and begin slowly slinking their way in the direction of the noise.
Sam: So a rock just fell?
Travis: A big statue just fell.
Sam: And is in pieces?
Matt: Parts of it are broken. It's still pretty sturdy.
Taliesin: Let's try and serpentine around and see if we can trace back.
Liam: And they're to the right or the left or ahead of us?
Matt: They're ahead of you.
Laura: Do they look like they saw us?
Liam: Go left. Jenga, jenga, jenga. Can we put Grog on the carpet now?
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: We're trying to go up, right?
Sam: No, we're trying to go towards the temple.
Laura: Towards that pulsing light.
Liam: We've got a little bit of business, a little bit of activity ahead of us, so we want to curve to the left.
Travis: All right, we move accordingly.
Matt: All right. So you guys move along the left and curve around the side. As you begin to move along the edge, you watch as about eight of these mostly-skeletal dwarvish corpses begin to shamble in the direction of where the noise came from. You can see elements of their long-mummified skin pulled tight against elements of the rib cage and the skull. Bits of chipped teeth, now broken against whatever things it's attempted to chew on its long un-life. As they move past, two of them glance over in the direction of Grog, and then all of them shift over in the direction and begin rushing forward in your path.
Liam: What's the distance?
Matt: At this point, they're probably about 50 or so feet from where you are.
Liam: Oh shit!
Laura: We don't want to make too much noise. I'm going to shoot a couple.
Travis: We could just go straight up.
Laura: There's only eight of them. We can take eight undead.
Liam: Pickle walks forward and takes a knee and waits with her holy symbol of Sarenrae, waiting for them.
Laura: I take two of them by surprise. That's auto-crit.
Liam: Vax does the same, watching his badass sister, and Pike waits to turn whatever's left of them.
Laura: Yeah, they're super-silent arrows.
Liam: So what happens first?
Matt: All right. She's preparing for it, right?
Liam: Yeah. She's waiting until she sees them.
Matt: Oh, well she also has darkvision of 60 feet.
Liam: So she's waiting until they're within range of her holy abilities.
Matt: What's the radius on that one?
Liam: That's a good question, because I'm a rogue paladin. (sighs) Goddamn it.
Matt: That's all right.
Liam: What if I look in the sorceror rules?
Matt: Nope. 30 feet.
Liam: 30 feet. So she's waiting for the twins to do their work and anything that's left over she's going to scatter.
Matt: Okay. All right. So as she holds position--
Laura: So it's auto-crit?
Matt: They know you're there. It's not a surprise. There's as threat, and they're rushing. But you do have advantage on the hits because they don't see you.
Laura: Well great, that's great. 20?
Matt: That definitely hits.
Laura: Okay. Oh, the other one super-duper hits. It's a 19 plus 14.
Liam: 25, 31, natural 20.
Matt: Okay. All right. So go ahead and roll damage on those. Are you shooting two different skeletons or one each?
Liam: I'm after my sister. She talked before I did.
Laura: I'll see how the first arrow hits?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 14. Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark. Whatever. 14, 15, 16. Two lightning damage. Do I add anything? Sneak attack!
Taliesin: Been a while.
Laura: How do we D&D? Plus ten sneak attack.
Matt: Okay. So the first skeleton, the arrow hits it and the torso explodes behind with ribs shattering and scattering across the stonework, its body falling and collapsing to the ground.
Laura: I hit another one.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Liam: Oh, and we go first, so it's advantage.
Laura: 14 plus four lightning damage. And that is plus eight.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. This one right behind it, its jaw unhinged slightly. Its tongue made of this slick rotting material that dangles through the hole in the bottom of the jaw. Comes around the corner, and you watch as part of its head explodes off one side from the secondary arrow, taking out what remains of the center of its skull, and the body crumples to the ground. Two skeletons down.
Liam: Sneak attack hits the first time we connect, right?
Matt: Yeah. You don't have to roll damage for that one.
Laura: Oh. Sorry, I did sneak attack on the second arrow.
Matt: Well, you can do sneak attack once per round.
Laura: Okay. I did eight damage too much.
Matt: It was still enough.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You don't have to roll damage for sneak attack.
Liam: So then that one's gone?
Matt: A third skeleton now is ruined. You hit it with the arrow in the middle of the spinal column, and it folds on itself.
Liam: Okay. So paladin action-action and my bonus action. So that's the first of three. The last one's the one that was a critical hit so the second one goes onto the next whole skeleton. It's just an eight.
Matt: Okay. This one the arrow slides into the side of the skull, and it keeps coming forward towards Grog.
Liam: Okay. And then the last critical hit, which is Whisper again, because it bamfed back, is two plus eight is ten. Two and three. It's not that much. It's 15 total.
Matt: Okay. And that one does finish it. So that's three skeletons down. Grog, I want to to individually roll an initiative check for me.
Travis: Natural 20. With Gil's dice.
Matt: So as you guys are watching this happen, the other five rush in to close the gap, but you are at the ready, and you get to strike before they do.
Travis: Nice. Am I hitting them? Yeah, Okay. Reckless, great weapon master. 31 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay, cool.
Matt: Your minimum damage will kill them. So as the first one comes up towards you, you swing up. As you slam into it, you watch as its bony body blows up against the side of the nearby stone building and then scrapes to the ground.
Travis: Can I use the other strike on another?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Reckless great weapon. That'll hit. That's like 30.
Taliesin: If there's anything left on Grog by the end of this, I'll try to swipe them off with my sword.
Travis: 32.
Matt: All righty. So two more detonate on this point. So there's three left. They're closing in on Grog. Does Pike want to take her turn?
Travis: We might want to save that Turnt Undead.
Laura: No, I think we should save.
Liam: I've already said it, but she's whispering to me to hold. She's half of Pike right now. You're half of Pike right now.
Taliesin: I'd like to pop in and see if I could take a couple--
Matt: Make an initiative roll.
Laura: Don't shoot, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm not; I'm going to use my sword.
Liam: Pike holds, breathing hard, looking at them coming on.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Yeah, that beats them by one. So yeah, as the three remaining ones start charging in towards Grog--
Taliesin: I'm going to run in, draw the silvered sword, and take some swipes.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Let's take three swipes right out of here.
Laura: Pike can use her mace on anything left in that area.
Taliesin: That's one natural 20, one natural 19. Do I crit on a 19 with the sword?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind. And a two. But that might be enough, because I have a really high-- that's a 15 as my lowest to hit. Does a 15 hit?
Matt: 15 does hit. Yes.
Taliesin: So the 15 is-- That's 14 piercing damage to the first one with a silvered sword.
Matt: Okay. You rush up and you carve through the first skeleton, and it breaks on the ground in front of you.
Taliesin: Number two is 13 points of damage to the second one.
Matt: Okay. The second one, you bring the blade down into the skull and cleave it in half. You watch as part of its skull breaks off to the side and the jaw falls to the ground and the rest crumbles in place.
Taliesin: I twirl around and take my third wonderful pirouette attack, which is 20 points of damage.
Matt: Okay, and as the final one lunges forward, in a fervent-- strangely faster than you expect for a skeletal undead, it begins to accelerate towards Grog. And with that, you take the blade and take the head right off at the neck, and it falls and crumples to the ground.
Marisha: So it's like 28 Days Later zombies?
Travis: 28 Days Later, they run.
Marisha: He said that they were fast.
Matt: Well, the last one-- it was flavor.
Marisha: Just wanted to make sure they weren't special.
Matt: Okay. As you finish the fray and hold yourself, you wait and wait. You do not hear or notice any more advancing undead from that direction.
Travis: Okay, how about I don't move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue glowy window?
Taliesin: We have to stick together.
Laura: Is the glowy window within 60 feet?
Taliesin: No, it's far.
Travis: When we were at the opening, we were 50 to 60 feet away.
Matt: The temple where you guys were at, at the time was 50 feet away from you, but you would have crossed the other side of the hall. So now it's about 100 feet away from you. At this distance, you can see it's a round, almost cylindrical building, Colosseum-esque. And there's a small square window about every 25 to 30 feet. And it's big. It's large, but you can see that faint glow between multiple windows from this distance.
Travis: So should we fly up to that window?
Taliesin: I think it'd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak. Because if we're the air, they are going to see us.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And we still have Pass Without a Trace, so let's go.
Laura: Yes, we do. She cast it.
Matt: All right, now that this brief combat has finished, those who took place in it, which would be you, Vax, Grog, and Percy have to remake your stealth checks.
Laura: You're like, "Gladly!"
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: What about Pike? Because she just knelt down. She didn't really fight.
Matt: She stepped out of her stealth. She was making herself visible.
Laura: My natural 20 for Pike, wasted!
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: We still have Pass Without Trace?
Marisha: Yes. I didn't do anything.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: Keeping that concentration.
Taliesin: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Marisha: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Liam: You're the doctor! Keep your patients on the run!
Laura: 30 for Pike. 29 for me.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to slowly make your way along the left wall of this large cavern.
Liam: 37, by the way.
Matt: Good to know. As you slowly move through the shadows, dodging through open doorways and through windows, trying the best you can to stay out from the center thoroughfare of this opening, you see more and more of these undead. Dozens, maybe even a hundred have crossed your path at the perimeter of your visual range and you can see in the catwalks above too, with the faint bit of the orange glow, occasionally shapes breaking across the orange. This entire cavern is swarming.
Laura: (whispering) Do we still have the thing?
Sam: Oh, the filter? The censer?
Laura: Do we have it in the Bag of Holding?
Taliesin: We also have the herbs.
Laura: What if we use it? What if we use it and it just repels them?
Taliesin: When it's time. We don't have a lot of it.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a very small amount.
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Taliesin: Let's prepare it, and when it's time--
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Marisha: Yeah it's dried. I spent that time. I spent time during the break.
Taliesin: It's just burning the herbs, though. We don't need the censer. Just hold it in your hands.
Liam: Do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern? Or are we totally fucking turned around?
Matt: No. I mean you have a decent sense. You are maybe 100 to 150 feet from where you began. Because you've been moving slowly. Staying stealthily, you're moving very carefully and very slowly and judging by the shape of the cavern and where you are currently, you're about halfway through it, or close to halfway.
Taliesin: It's good that we didn't go on the catwalk.
Matt: The temple's on the opposite side of the chamber.
Liam: Oh! All the way on the other side. I thought it was central.
Matt: I'm sorry. When you entered the entrance, the temple was to the front and to the right of you. You guys curved around the left, on the other side of it, keeping a view on it so you could see it from across the way. Are you making your way across to the temple?
Liam: So it's pressed against the opposite wall of this big place?
Sam: Are the undead all around the temple?
Matt: Further in. Nothing directly around the outside of the temple. So you guys curve around the entrance where you came and slowly make your way towards where the temple emerges from the rock wall. About a third or so of its exterior wall is actually built into the side of this cavern, and the large cylindrical-like Colosseum temple structure curves outward. You can see as you get closer to it, there's maybe the three floors to it but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and you can see areas where it looks like it's sustained some physical damage or eroded over time. You eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This is an old temple.
Liam: Is that light you talked about coming from one specific source, or all over the place? Every window.
Travis: Is there a story?
Matt: It looks to be coming from the base.
Liam: From down below.
Laura: Can we see in one of the windows?
Matt: You can look inside. Make a perception check.
Sam: Are there any bone laying around?
Matt: Plenty.
Sam: I am going to pick up two bones, give them to Simon Two, and tell him to go across the street, 50 feet away from us, and wait there in some building. Hold these bones.
Matt: You watch as two bone shards slowly glide over, then stand there.
Laura: 34.
Matt: Okay. As you pull up to the window and glance down, you immediately look inside the temple, and you see about 30 or so silhouettes of shambling dwarven corpses all standing inside the base floor of this temple. You see the silhouettes and shapes because they are all faintly outlined from the source of this blue light. You see a small, baseball-sized, bluish crystal that is resting, not in the perfect center of the temple but somewhere in the open middle floor area, and it looks like these 30 undead are surrounding it, and standing.
Sam: Smash and grab. You could go in there and get that thing, be out before they even saw you in there.
Taliesin: Also, have your unseen servant make a bunch of noise and have them all--
Marisha: Be a distraction?
Laura: Yeah, but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds.
Taliesin: We can have the unseen servant pick it up.
Marisha: How far away can he be, though?
Sam: He's 50 feet away, right now, and he's waiting to make noise.
Taliesin: What if he were to go in and get it himself?
Sam: He could.
Travis: He is invisible, isn't he?
Sam: He could go and pick it up and come right back with it.
Laura: But first don't tell him to come right out, tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they follow the light.
Liam: But what are our options if that doesn't work?
Sam: If he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work, or it doesn't move?
Liam: I want to do that. If that doesn't work, I can click the boots, and I can be there in a heartbeat and run, but what do we do next?
Sam: We need an escape plan, right? How many can fit on the carpet?
Liam: This goes back to my conversation with you, which is: are we going to find a pocket and rest?
Taliesin: Yes, but not here.
Liam: Agreed, but we're talking about Vasselheim, and is damage to Vasselheim a sacrifice needed to be ready to do what's necessary?
Travis: If he destroys Vasselheim, he does his miracle, his display of power, and he will be even stronger. That is not an option.
Taliesin: If we were to be clever, if we're at the edge of Vasselheim, the Vasselheim forces will be distracting his forces, so we'll have less to deal with, so we want this fight to happen at the edge.
Liam: So we're talking about no rest. I'm not talking about a short rest.
Taliesin: There will not be a long rest, I don't think.
Laura: There might be.
Liam: Not without him spilling into Vasselheim.
Marisha: I've been very conservative with what I've been doing for a reason.
Travis: I don't think a long rest is in the cards.
Taliesin: I've only burned one thing that requires a long rest.
Marisha: I agree with Grog. We can't sacrifice having him gain all of those followers, because then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers, which I'm not really comfortable with.
Travis: And he may be too strong at that point.
Sam: We don't need to discuss this now. We need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here!
Taliesin: If we can pull this off without burning anything important, then it doesn't matter.
Marisha: I want to go on record and say I think this is stupid. Okay, let's go.
Laura: That crystal looks really appetizing, and I want it.
Travis: How about we get ready to leave? I'll get on the carpet.
Laura: It looks really super magical.
Travis: Who's on the broom with Vex?
Laura: Me.
Travis: No, who is on the broom with you?
Taliesin: I'll be on the broom with her.
Travis: Do you want to get on the carpet with me?
Sam: Yeah, of course.
Marisha: I have to come with you because I have the Pass Without a Trace spell.
Taliesin: We all have to be together. We can't separate.
Travis: And he can fly.
Sam: No, he can't. He's done with his wings.
Liam: Yeah, that's right.
Sam: We have too many people for the carpet and the broom.
Liam: My wings are gone. There's no wings for Vecna unless we rest.
Travis: Well, kick Trinket out of the necklace, and I'll get in there.
Taliesin: I can also climb up the wall, if need be.
Sam: We can leave Trinket.
Liam: It's fine, I still have the boots. Just the wings. It was death or wings. I chose wings.
Travis: All right, so how do we fly? How do we do that?
Sam: I can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something.
Taliesin: Just for shits and giggles, I'm going to take one last look around to see if there's any infrastructure for getting up. There must be infrastructure for getting up here. There wasn't layers of a city on top of each other.
Sam: We could just run.
Liam: But wait, where are we going though if we get this thing?
Sam: Up away.
Liam: We have no verification of an exit or a hole or anything!
Travis: Yeah, sometimes you just got to leap, okay?
Liam: That's my entire life, but this is the last moment.
Sam: Every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit, right? Wait, no, lungs don't; they just have the one.
Marisha: Wait up, we argued more this game more than anything else. Okay, we know we still have to fly upwards, including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right?
Laura: No, the blue crystal is right here.
Marisha: Well, then what the fuck?
Laura: I don't know!
Liam: We have a plan for getting the crystal, just not how to get the fuck out.
Marisha: We fucking fly!
Travis: Who burns a spell to become an animal?
Marisha: I can burn a spell.
Travis: You do that.
Marisha: We're probably going to take another short rest, right?
Travis: Probably.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I can recall Simon 2. I can send him across the room, make a bunch of noise, draw a bunch of people over there. You run, grab the crystal, and then we hustle out of there.
Travis: What if only half the room leaves, though?
Laura: No, you go get Simon 2 to go get the crystal.
Sam: And there's going to be a floating crystal that marches across?
Travis: They don't give a shit. Do it. I'm on the carpet. We're ready to go.
Marisha: You're on me? And you're on carpet, and you're on broom?
Travis: Percy and Vex are on the broom.
Matt: Gnomes on the carpet with Grog. You and Percy on the broom. You're transforming into what creature?
Marisha: Giant eagle.
Matt: Giant eagle.
Marisha: Not yet, though.
Laura: And then we all, within 60 feet of each other, fly up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Okay, who's doing what?
Laura: Simon 2.
Sam: Simon 2 is going to go get the thing. Let's say they all start watching the thing come towards us. Grog, are you here? Are you with us?
Travis: Yeah, I have to be.
Sam: Can you throw something across the room to make a noise?
Travis: Yep. I can absolutely do that.
Laura: I'll prime an arrow.
Travis: I have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it. It will even burn when it lands. It's been sitting in there for four years.
Sam: This is a terrible plan.
Taliesin: This is why we hoarded it in the first place.
Sam: Guys, I'm just going to say this one more time before we do this: he's way faster than Simon 2. Simon 2 could create a distraction. He could (snatching noise).
Liam: Scanlan, only with the boots.
Travis: If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel, and we'll leave.
Taliesin: If they chase the jewel, we can grab it and run, anyway.
Sam: All right, Simon 2. Come back with your bones!
Matt: The bones shift over towards you ever-so-slowly.
Liam: (singing) Don't worry, be happy now.
Sam: All right. Simon 2, go to the middle of the room. Throw the bones away, far, then grab the crystal. You don't have pockets. Run back to us! Away, yeah. Should he cover it with a blanket or something? Do you have a hood?
Matt: The bones begin to drift.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm not saying no.
Laura: A handkerchief to put over the light.
Sam: So it blocks the light? All right, so go put this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only hope.
Matt: Is Simon holding bones or a blanket?
Sam: He's holding a blanket.
Taliesin: He's holding a hanky.
Laura: He's holding a hanky.
Travis: Put the bones down gently.
Sam: Give me the bones. I put the bones down. Here's a handkerchief. You'll put it over the crystal, pick up the crystal, and bring it back to us.
Matt: Simon begins to slowly walk, the handkerchief floating by.
Taliesin: This is like those little handkerchief ghosts you would make in kindergarten.
Matt: As you glance inside and watch as it happens, you can see all the undead that are in there are standing, unmoving, swaying a little bit in place. Simon's about 30 feet out from them. About 20 feet out. They don't notice his presence. You notice that all the undead are facing the crystal, by the way.
Laura: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: (laughing) That's crucial information.
Sam: Right before he picks it up, hock a rock as far as you can.
Travis: Not the lantern?
Taliesin: Not the rock, the lantern. Light the lantern and throw it.
Marisha: By the way, they're all staring right at you. They're 100 percent aware of what's going on.
Matt: They're not staring at you. They're staring at the crystal.
Laura: They will be staring at us. What if we destroy the crystal? I wonder if all the undead would die. Let's keep going.
Matt: The handkerchief makes its way forward. Simon walks between the undead, and they don't even notice.
Sam: That's a good guy, that Simon 2.
Marisha: What happens?
Matt: The handkerchief moves over onto the crystal, and all the undead look over to the crystal, and the crystal lifts, and they all begin to (groans).
Travis: I take the hooded lantern and I (laughs) I throw the fucking piss out of it.
Matt: Make an attack roll. Roll and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Oh, that's good! 19.
Matt: You're adding your strength modifier to that? Yeah. You're aiming at the opposite end?
Travis: If the entrance is here, I'm throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are.
Matt: With your strength? Easy enough. You lob it. It arcs over (flame noises) and explodes. The oil spreads across the ground. Flames ignite, and the bright light that emanates from it and the flames burst, and all the undead turn over (grunting) and begin to retract away. Two of them are following Simon. Only two of the undead are following Simon, currently. The others are distracted by the detonation of flame. They look confused.
Liam: How close are the pursuers?
Matt: They're making their way slowly. No, they're much faster than Simon.
Liam: I'm throwing.
Laura: I'm going to get down and shoot.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just the ones following Simon!
Matt: Both of you guys roll an attack.
Travis: Are they far away from the other ones that aren't leaving yet?
Taliesin: It doesn't matter; they're not paying attention.
Laura: 25. No, 33.
Liam: 29.
Matt: Roll damage.
Taliesin: They drop out of nowhere. They faint. It's going to be good.
Marisha: So we hope.
Taliesin: I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Travis. Come on. Now is not the time to get squeamish.
Laura: 24.
Taliesin: We made a solemn oath.
Sam: They were innocent.
Taliesin: We agreed, weeks ago.
Liam: I rolled a 77 for mine.
Sam: 77?!
Matt: These two skeletons almost atomize. As they're walking, they're both gaining on Simon, and as they both start reaching towards where the dull bluish glow, mostly muted by the handkerchief, is floating in the air, they (growl) towards it. You watch as both their heads and torsos scatter across the ground, like a heavy wave of force blasted them across the stonework. The scraping sound hits as the detonation hits. The flames are dying down, and... no, no other undead see it. Slowly, the stone floats past, out of the doorway, and makes its way back to you.
Taliesin: Drop it in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: At this point, Simon's getting real close to the end of his hour-long casting time.
Sam: You've served us well.
Travis: Bag of Holding. It doesn't hurt my hand, or anything, does it?
Matt: No.
Travis: Cool! We've got that.
Matt: Whatever it is.
Laura: I guess we have it.
Marisha: Nothing happened to them when we put it in the Bag of Holding? They were like, (groaning) and kept going? All the undead?
Matt: All the undead inside that were distracted by the explosion of the lantern are riled up now, and they're starting to wander around, and some of them are starting to make their way towards the entrance to the temple. Some are making their way toward the staircase to head upward.
Marisha: Are we flying?
Travis: Yes, we fly up.
Matt: All right. You go into eagle form, grab Vax, and all of you guys make your way up into the cavern entrance.
Laura: Bubble. Tight bubble.
Matt: Currently, I believe the eagle form has darkvision. Right now, you have no light source.
Liam: I do. I can say things to her. I can see.
Matt: Right, so you guys are able to maneuver. So as you guys head up into the center part of the cavern, above the catwalks, you can see as you push through, about a third of them are still standing. A lot of them have collapsed in the center, and there's edges of bridges that come to a halt where they've collapsed and tumbled down into the cavern below. You can see straggling undead wandering the catwalks and these pathways along the edges of the cavern. As you pass forward through them-- I imagine you guys are cruising through as fast as you can?
Taliesin: Trying to avoid them.
Laura: We'll try to avoid the clusters.
Matt: A few of them seem to glance up and see you as you pass and reach, but they have nowhere to go. As you begin to cruise through the center of this cavern, following it to the opposite side, it widens further, and now as you look down, faintly, you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent fungus that are growing within this city below. You can see elements of these beautiful statues that are partially crumbled. You can see small homes that litter the center of this chamber. You can see some of the catwalks that meet in the center of this actually meet in a suspended platform that contains another dome-like structure that is partially caved in. With another shake and impact of the titan's footfall, you watch as one of its suspension pillars cracks, and the entire center finally gives way and falls and slams down, collapsing into the center of the chamber, it being there for the final moment of its tensile strength. As it slams down, you watch as it crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below, and from that blast, you can see something on the interior of it was apparently explosive or flammable, and it explodes, giving a brief flash of light into the center of this cavern. Where you had the brief outside of your visual range, you now look around and see the entirety of these dozens of catwalks and the city below you. Hundreds and hundreds of roving skeletons and mostly decomposed, mummified dwarven corpses that all glance towards this explosion. Some have been blasted away from it by the impact of the detonation. Others are making their way towards what the strange sound was, drawn towards it, but you're keeping this central safe space between, where none of them can grasp or assail you.
Laura: Were there other buildings like that, ready to fall from the ceiling?
Matt: Currently, what you see is just the one.
Liam: I'm looking for gaps or holes or anything in the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out. MATT; You see entrances to homes that are built into the sides.
Sam: What about a tunnel or anything?
Matt: Make a perception check. Anyone who has darkvision can make a perception check.
Marisha: I have keen sight. Does that count?
Matt: You have advantage on your perception.
Marisha: Oh, shitty and shittier.
Liam: 27.
Travis: 18.
Laura: 18.
Sam: I didn't do one.
Marisha: 28.
Sam: I'm weeping over Simon 2.
Matt: Oh. Your keen eagle vision-- wait, you said you rolled shitty and shittier and still got 28?
Marisha: I have a plus 13, plus advantage.
Matt: Right. All right, cool. So glancing through your eagle vision, you can see the top of the chamber almost seems to come to a conical shape, and as you look up to the top of it, it emerges into a completely vertical chamber that rises up and out of the central opening of the city of Thomara.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: I take the lead, I guess. (caws)
Laura: (shushes) Caw quietly.
Liam: Vax is trying to appreciate his last ride.
Travis: Debbie Downer.
Liam: No way! I'm not going to stop. Fuck you all. Every game until the end, motherfuckers!
Matt: As the group of you make your way up into this vertical cavern, we're going to take a break. I need to take a break, myself.
Travis: Remember, we have the--
Travis: Sponsored announcement.
Matt: That's right. We have the Shadow of War video coming up at this break to give you a glance at this game coming up that we're all part of. If you haven't seen it, or if you have seen it, check it out, anyway. It's pretty awesome. Also, for this week's giveaway, Wyrmwood, we've got a little video for you here to show you what's up and what you can do and try to win it at the break, so pay attention, stick around, and we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.
Liam: This is what's up!
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so last we left off, you guys were all traveling upward through various means of flight, through a peak in the central cavern chamber in the center of Thomara, the long-dead dwarven city. As you begin to climb upward through this 15-foot-wide or so upward hallway, this cylindrical cavern, you continue upward for about 50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of this chamber, and then it opens up into a domed room. Immediately, as you fly up, you see a ceiling come up, and you have to coast off to the side. You catch yourself, hovering there as the rest of you guys make your way in there. This domed, mushroom-shaped chamber with a very thin, circular floor around the outside with the hole that you entered at the bottom. Whoever would stand on the edge there would have the opportunity to either leap into or toss something down into this hole that would then drop them right into the center of the city.
Taliesin: Weird question  if I were holding the blue gem and had dropped it down this hole, what would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up?
Matt: Not at all. It was a ways off.
Taliesin: Just checking.
Laura: Are there any undead around us right now?
Matt: Currently? Glancing around, you do not see any undead.
Marisha: You said things or people? Is this a body-sized hole?
Matt: No, it's about 15 feet wide. The full chamber is maybe 50 or so feet across. About a 20-foot walkway, circular, before the hole in the center.
Liam: Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave, or does it look made?
Matt: If you glance down and look about the interior of this chamber, it is not natural. It is all carved.
Laura: Can we look at the gem for a second, since there's no undead around?
Matt: If you want to. Grog has it.
Travis: Do you want me to pull it out?
Laura: Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it?
Sam: Sure. I can look at it.
Laura: How big is it? Is it baseball-sized?
Matt: It's about that big.
Travis: No undead, right? No creatures, nobody that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light?
Laura: We can't see anything around us?
Matt: Not at the moment, no.
Sam: I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18 arcana check.
Matt: Okay. It's definitely magical. The blue light from it grows stronger, then weaker. Stronger, then weaker. It has this rhythmic flash to it, like a heart or something that has a pulse to it.
Marisha: How is it lining up towards the steps of the giant?
Matt: Not at all. It's much quicker.
Marisha: Much quicker.
Matt: It's cold to the touch.
Taliesin: Does it do anything to the Titanstone Knuckles?
Liam: Is it faster than my heartbeat?
Matt: It's slower.
Liam: Slower.
Travis: That's slow.
Marisha: So it's very slow, but not as slow as the rate he's walking.
Travis: Is it a cut jewel, or is it rough?
Matt: It's rough. No jeweler's hand has touched it. There are some edges that have flat surfaces; it looks like there have been things that have chipped off the stone.
Taliesin: Does it have the vibe of something petrified?
Matt: No, it has almost a quartz-like look to it. Elements of it appear to be cloudier or imperfect, and some areas appear to be clearer, and light shines through a little brighter.
Liam: It's like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals.
Matt: Yeah, but there is an enchantment.
Sam: What about Pikey-pants? Can she detect if it's evil or good or something? Does she do that?
Laura: You should do that.
Liam: I'm going to do that.
Matt: Okay. You don't get a sense of any evil from the stone.
Sam: You said no sense of evil?
Matt: No evil coming from the stone.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to gaze into it super hard.
Matt: You look really hard into the stone as you hold it to your face, and your eyes almost cross as you glance into the very core source of this pulsating arcane energy. It's bright.
Laura: So bright, y'all.
Matt: It hurts a little bit, and you wince after a while.
Laura: I saw so many things.
Liam: She looked at the eclipse, too.
Travis: We don't have Identify or anything like that, do we?
Marisha: No.
Sam: No.
Laura: You know who had that?
Sam: No, who?
Laura: Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful.
Sam: Who is it? Oh, the fancy fellow? He's probably dead somewhere.
Travis: I think we should try and smash it.
Sam: Don't you think that about everyone and everything?
Marisha: I'm not against this idea.
Travis: What else are we going to do to it before we face El Vecna?
Taliesin: My only other thought of how it could be useful, at this point, with what we know about it--
Sam: Is "El Vecna" Spanish for Vecna?
Travis: Sí.
Taliesin: It seemed like the undead were crowding towards it, which means that if we do get attacked by a group of undead, we might be able to shiny-object them, unless, of course, it's dangerous in their hands.
Travis: Or we spike it down the hole, and it causes a hydrogen bomb, and we shatter this titan in half.
Taliesin: That literally made the dungeon master laugh, so I don't know if that's necessarily--
Travis: It's blue, right? That is the color of hydrogen.
Taliesin: That's the color of Dr. Manhattan. I don't necessarily know if it's the same thing.
Travis: It is known.
Sam: Why don't we hang onto it for now? In a moment of peril, we can throw it or smash it.
Taliesin: Not crazy, trying to crack it.
Liam: What if it stops this thing where it stands? We're all thinking that this thing could be its heart.
Sam: Its heart?
Travis: It's palm-sized, right?
Taliesin: It could be a chunk of heart.
Laura: Is it the same color as his Knuckles?
Travis: No, these are stone-gray. This is blue crystal.
Matt: There's nothing about it that gives you the sense, based on what you've seen both outside and within the titan, that it is of similar essence to the titan, from what you understand.
Travis: It could be a soul or something.
Sam: Soul glow?
Travis: Does Pike have anything that detects a soul?
Liam: It's not evil. It's not good. It could be the thing that's keeping these undead moving.
Travis: Well, then I don't know what else to do. I think we keep moving.
Liam: I like the spiking idea.
Laura: I'm okay squishing it with the hammer.
Liam: I think that you should let me squish it, because if that blows up--
Laura: I think it's funny that we spent so much time getting it, and then we're going to destroy it.
Liam: We spent ten minutes getting this thing.
Travis: We'll think about smashing it when we take our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself.
Taliesin: Hold onto it for now. It could come in handy.
Marisha: It's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a purpose.
Sam: All right, focus!
Laura: Let's get out of this dome.
Travis: Is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered?
Matt: On the edge of the circle? No. It's smooth stone, intently designed to be a drop or opening of some kind.
Taliesin: Are there exits?
Matt: Make an investigation check. You don't see any doorways or passageways.
Marisha: Wait, there's not a hole that we can go up?
Matt: There's a hole that you came through to come into this chamber. Imagine a dome. You're in the chamber.
Taliesin: I literally rolled a one. I'm aware that there's a hole.
Matt: You get vertigo as you stand in the chamber.
Laura: Is this investigation or perception?
Matt: You look about, and you don't see any exit. Investigation to see if there's any hidden or not-immediately-noticeable exits or entryways.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. As you do a pass around, looking closely along the wall, you see two small domed doors that have metal rods jammed through, almost like a small barricade that's been placed down on one side of a doorway. However, they are closed from this side.
Laura: So you could open them up?
Matt: You could.
Laura: Are they trapped? I'll look to see if they're trapped.
Liam: On it.
Travis: Also fair to assume that whatever's on the other side of that door--
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27?
Laura: I rolled an 18.
Matt: You're both looking at the same one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Neither of you notice any traps.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to try to jimmy open that lock.
Travis: Whoa.
Laura: I already said it.
Matt: Make a strength check.
Liam: Not locked.
Laura: Two! Wait. Yeah, that's straight-up strength, not a saving throw? Two!
Sam: Two?
Laura: I'm really fucking weak. You'd think I'd be stronger pulling the bowstring, but no.
Travis: Use your legs. Really, use your legs.
Laura: Okay. I put my legs up on the wall and (grunts).
Matt: It is not budging.
Liam: Can I use my finger skills to see if it's locked? Just my finger skills. I made a perception check to see if it's trapped. Wouldn't I know if it's locked?
Matt: The lock is the barricading mechanism on it. There is no handle.
Liam: I'm going to try to sidestep this lock with my lock-picking skills.
Travis: It's a barricade.
Marisha: It's a barricade.
Liam: There's nothing to do?
Marisha: It's like steel rebar in front of the door.
Travis: Is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door? Anything other than a portal to go through?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The room's pretty simple. The construction of it may be older than most of the things that you've seen in the city below and previous chambers. It seems to be built almost for function rather than ceremony.
Laura: It's a trash chute.
Marisha: That's what I was going to say. Is it a water chute? Drainage? Is this a drain pipe?
Laura: We could fill the city with water. Drown all the zombies.
Matt: One thing you do notice, which is interesting as you're glancing around at the side, looking at the ground at the bottom of it, there's a very faint groove in the ground that leads toward the central hole at the base of each of these doorways.
Marisha: Does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room?
Matt: No, just the two doors on the opposite sides.
Travis: How far apart are the doors?
Matt: Opposite sides of the chamber, yeah.
Taliesin: So there's a bar. The door is barred, then?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: So break it. Let's get out of the way and pop the bar. See if we can pop the bar right off the door.
Travis: Do we want to have Keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through, and she can Wall of Stone the door?
Marisha: I'll be with you. Yeah. I'm right behind you, man.
Travis: I will try and remove one of the doors. I don't know how to delineate between them.
Taliesin: The left one.
Travis: Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25.
Matt: 25. It immediately comes off to the side, and when you lift it, you realize that it's bolted to the wall to the side, and it curves upward and holds it in place. This is meant to stay in place.
Laura: Wow. Really? It was meant to move? I think I loosened it for you, Grog.
Travis: I didn't get that sense at all.
Matt: As you lift it up, the door is now unbarred.
Travis: Shall I?
Laura: Yeah, open the door!
Travis: Are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me?
Matt: It looks like it opens towards you, yes.
Travis: I'll pull open the door.
Marisha: I'm at the ready for whatever.
Matt: Okay. We'll say as you entered and landed, the door on the left. Okay, so as you pull that one open, immediately preparing yourself, a couple of rocks tumble out, and it reveals a packed-tight mass of earth and stone.
Laura: Shit! Let's try the other one.
Travis: Should I punch the rubble?
Laura: No, let's try the other door first.
Travis: I make my way around.
Taliesin: We set ourselves up.
Travis: 20 on the dot.
Matt: 20. (metal creaking) It lifts over without an issue. Pull the door open. You lift it open, and a few rocks tumble past, but a slick rockslide incline continues upward, dry, no water. Nothing.
Travis: A rockslide continues onward. Slick, dry.
Laura: How big is the tunnel?
Matt: It's about four feet wide or so.
Laura: So we can fit in?
Matt: Yeah, you can fit in.
Taliesin: We have some Immovable Rods.
Matt: When I say slide, I mean smooth stone, like an actual slide. You get the sense that there was some sort of aqueduct-type scenario.
Laura: We brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we don't slide down.
Taliesin: Whoever's in the back should have the Immovable Rods, so if there's a sudden rush of water, we can create a grate for ourselves.
Matt: You envision that at one point, long ago, this would have been a beautiful waterfall in the center of Thomara's chamber that has now dried.
Travis: Dope. That's awesome. I'm getting creepy as fuck now. I've got the Immovable Rod; I'll be the caboose.
Marisha: I've got the other one, so I'll be second.
Matt: So Grog is the caboose.
Marisha: Keyleth in front of Grog.
Matt: Keyleth in front of Grog? All right. Who's in front of them?
Sam: Me.
Matt: Scanlan.
Laura: Pike.
Matt: Then Pike. All righty.
Taliesin: Myself and the twins, I suppose.
Laura: Yeah. I want to be in the front.
Travis: I'll go ahead and take the Immovable Rod out and have it in my hand.
Marisha: Samesies.
Matt: So you've got both of those. Oh, I totally forgot there was a winner for this. I'm sorry. I should do that, huh? RyanBoo, you're the winner. Danoba will contact you and get you your cherry deck box soon. Now that's taken care of. You make your way up the slide, and it's relatively gradual; it's not too heavy of a scenario. You make your way upward, upward, and about 30 or so feet up, the walls of it separate out and appear to break into two smaller chambers, like this was a breaking point where a person could enter from either side to check on the flow or do maintenance on whatever the ducting was. The slide continues upward. Vax and Vex, you get to that portion and lift yourselves up, looking right to left. It ends on one side, and it looks like there's some dry-rotted wooden crates, and to the left, a staircase.
Marisha: So it looks like a landing?
Matt: It's a brief landing for somebody who needed to come in and do repairs, maintenance, or checking on the flow of water.
Laura: Keep going up the slide or take the stairs?
Liam: Quick glance in the crates?
Marisha: No, if you're going to take a quick glance, then we have to bust them open like a proper RPG.
Travis: They're dry-rotted. They'll break easy.
Matt: They will. What do you do?
Liam: Check them out. I eat some edamame.
Matt: So you lift the crates. There are only two of them, and they're relatively small: two feet by two feet. The first one, you open up and look inside, and there are rusted tools. Long iron bars; some appear wrench-like. It looks like whatever mechanism was used as the early aqueduct system for this, this box contained materials, though you're uncertain as to what their application was into this system.
Taliesin: I'll take a glance at these things to memorize their general shape.
Travis: After you're done with them, I'll actually take them.
Matt: You go and grab a few. There's five rods of varying widths. Some appear to be ratchet elements, where they fit around different metal caps. There's one that looks like a wide crowbar that's used to hold or wedge elements separately. Very basic; nothing too intricate.
Taliesin: This is some basic shit that you're picking up right now.
Liam: That was the first crate. What's the next crate? Is it whoopee cushions?
Matt: No, the next crate you open up and it looks mostly empty, but it looks like there are a couple of rows of small glass vials, half of which appear to be broken or shattered, but there are three remaining, with a faint bluish liquid on the inside.
Laura: Does that sound familiar to us at all?
Liam: Healing potions are blue.
Matt: These don't resemble healing potions, actually.
Taliesin: Do these resemble underwater breathing?
Matt: They do. You've seen these before.
Liam: For toilet diving.
Taliesin: Emergency, yeah. Let's take those.
Travis: Okay. I got them.
Liam: I give one of them to Percy for being so sharp. I give one to my sister. You don't need it. I keep one. No, I don't. I'm barely alive. I give one to Scanlan.
Sam: I give it to Grog.
Travis: I've got one. I've got two, actually.
Sam: All right, then I'll keep one.
Taliesin: Just in case.
Travis: I've got two vials of underwater breathing.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Why is there no water running?
Travis: Any other boxes to smash?
Matt: No.
Marisha: I'd imagine because he's vertical now instead of horizontal.
Travis: And undead.
Sam: Let's keep going up the stairs.
Matt: All right. Heading up the stairs in the same order?
Liam: 30 to 40 feet in advance.
Matt: All righty. 30 to 40 feet in advance? Okay. You make your way up the staircase. Roll stealth.
Travis: Immovable Rod's out.
Liam: 28 for stealth.
Matt: Okay. Are you stealthing, as well? Are you going along with him, or are you letting him go ahead?
Liam: She's coming.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: All right, so the two of you very quietly make your way ahead, the rest of you keeping within, I assume, the range of the ring. The staircase doesn't go too far; it goes maybe 30 or so feet, and then it opens into a hallway. You're stepping up through the floor, and there's about ten feet behind and to the sides of you. There's a slight element of a cave-in to the left of you, where part of the stone seems to have collapsed, and a bit of the earth has filtered in. It's a smooth stone floor that's tiled in places. The walls continue on, a somewhat trapezoid-like angle. There are other portions of the wall that have caved in on certain elements, and there are two large pillars that mark the center of this hallway, either used as support beams or decorative, but they go from ceiling to floor. You glance over the side, and you see a distant staircase on the far end of this hallway, maybe 80 to 90 feet from where you are, if not further, with larger stairs. You've seen some of the dwarven-based ones. These seem to be a little more grandiose as they lift up higher and higher. Part of that hallway is completely collapsed; it's a wall of fallen earth. But there's a hole carved out of it. There's a tunnel that has been pushed through. You hear this very faint buzzing sound. Very faint. This (low humming). A very faint vibration. You also see a figure stepping from a side wall crevasse, an opening of a similar shape to the circular opening in the wall.
Liam: I hide.
Laura: We were stealthed.
Matt: You guys were stealthed. You re-hide, while stealthed.
Liam: That's what I do.
Matt: You hear some muttering across the way in the shadow. There's a faint source of light that looks like a glowing orb that's floating in the air above and giving this faint greenish-white light; a bauble that's giving a light source to whatever this cloaked figure is. You hear the muttering, and two more walk down the staircase to join them. You recognize, from the faint bit of light, a glimmer of metal around the neck of one of them that is the symbol, the hole with the metallic fork. You see Remnants of Vecna.
Sam: Remnants?
Matt: You don't see any faces. You see a glimmer or shine on the metal from the light cast from the bauble.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: What?
Taliesin: This can't be happening right now.
Liam: We don't recognize faces? We don't see faces?
Matt: You see hooded figures that are walking in. There are three of them.
Marisha: Oh, so they're cultists.
Matt: Okay. So which ones are you aiming at? There's three of them.
Laura: I'm aiming at the first one I saw.
Matt: Okay, the first one you saw just stepped out of the center of the hall there, and then the two others walked down the hallway. You're aiming at the one that came out of the side of the wall?
Laura: Has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet?
Matt: There's been discussion over the shoulder. They seem to be aware of each other's presence, but they haven't come together to engage as three in the same area yet.
Liam: I will follow my sister's lead. If she attacks one, I send one to another one and two to the third.
Laura: I'll attack the first so he can take the second.
Liam: One. Two, three.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: These are auto-crits, though, because we are surprising them.
Matt: This is true.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: Yes, you can Hunter's Mark him.
Laura: Oh, so we don't have to roll for attack? It's an auto-crit.
Matt: Well, no, you still have to roll to see if you aim. You have advantage on the attack.
Laura: 27.
Liam: 27 on my first.
Matt: Okay, both hit.
Laura: Second attack. Oh my god, 20. 20 on the second attack.
Matt: Okay, that hits.
Laura: I got a one on both. Thank god they were both at advantage.
Liam: 27. 19, 25.
Matt: Okay, all three hit.
Laura: And they're all critical?
Matt: No, the first one crits.
Liam: Oh, really? Okay. The first is sneak attack.
Matt: They're not all crit. Once you hit the person they are no longer surprised.
Laura: Okay, so the first one is a crit. Solid! That's okay.
Marisha: Yeah, I feel so bad for you.
Liam: You are the most powerful person at this table.
Laura: 14, plus six lightning damage. Oh wait, you know what? Should I single out the lightning damage or say what all the damage is?
Matt: Well, it's an auto-crit, so lightning damage is doubled, as well.
Laura: So it's 12 lightning damage.
Matt: Right, plus whatever your sneak attack damage is.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's happening.
Travis: You already did 40 point of damage without doubling.
Laura: Don't do that.
Sam: Travis, shut up! These two and their gigantic damage rolls.
Taliesin: Huge, mammoth.
Sam: Huge, bulbous.
Taliesin: Turgid.
Laura: I had already rolled that, but it was a six again, so 40, plus 12 lightning damage. On the first.
Matt: 52 points of damage.
Liam: I got 48 on my first, but that's it. 48, done.
Laura: I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage on that first guy.
Matt: This is on the other guy; the second guy.
Laura: Add ten because of Hunter's Mark on the first one.
Marisha: Little bit of that reach around.
Sam: The dice smell a little bit.
Liam: 48. 20, ten.
Matt: So 48 on your critical.
Liam: That's the critical. That's the dice damage. I rolled really low.
Matt: 20, ten. Okay, then. All righty. Are you shooting the same guy, Laura?
Laura: Yes, I was all on one, unless he went down. Would I notice?
Matt: No, he did not go down.
Laura: Okay, then the second one. 21 on the second one.
Matt: That does it.
Travis: How much damage? Total.
Matt: Total on that round from you would have been 110 with the first hit between the two of you on the first guy and the second hit. So the one that was off to the side, who is leaning forward, hunched over, and looking over his shoulder. The first arrow goes into the throat and he reaches for it, and as he does, the dagger (impact) into the face, into the socket where there is no eye, which then looks up with a groan. Finger goes out as soon as the second arrow takes the other eye out, and then falls back down to the ground, dead. Pointing your direction like (gasping). As soon as the two other daggers go into the other two, they both see the one crumple to the ground, the two left there, the guy who is standing at the stairs--
Liam: May I also dump some poison?
Matt: Sure, into which one?
Liam: Into the first one. I did one into my first target and two into the second; the poison would have gone into the second person. It's a DC of 15.
Matt: All righty. DC of 15? Yeah, that succeeds. 16.
Liam: So nothing, right?
Matt: Nothing, yeah.
Liam: Balls!
Matt: As soon as the one crumples to the ground and the two other daggers into the other two that are there, they (grunt). They see the one fall. The one in the center of the chamber glances over his shoulder and says, "It seems I'm the lucky one. Odell, run back and tell that Viskorad found sneaky prey." The one immediately to the left begins to run up the stairs.
Laura: Can I shoot him again before he runs away?
Matt: Nope because you took your turn. This is their reaction.
Sam: Oh shit. You need help, Matt?
Liam: Initiative!
Matt: We're about to roll initiative, motherfuckers.
Laura: Sorry, guys. We did it.
Marisha: Viskon? We've heard the name Viskon before.
Sam: We've also heard the name Odell.
Liam: Yeah, Odell.
Marisha: Odell comma tell Viskon we have visitors. Wait, when did we hear Odell before?
Liam: I just know we've heard it.
Sam: There's been three Jamieson's in our campaign, too. Matt isn't an infinite fount of names.
Matt: Everyone else is still down the stairs right there.
Laura: I wonder if we should have let them talk for a second. Oh, well.
Liam: That's not our way.
Matt: Apparently not, as recent events have shown. So now, I need everyone to roll initiative.
Travis: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Laura: No, it's okay. I've got advantage.
Marisha: Don't let them leave. I agree with that.
Taliesin: Leave one of them alive, but don't let them leave.
Liam: Not good for Pike.
Marisha: Did everyone roll shittily?
Travis: No.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Laura: 23.
Travis: 21.
Liam: Get that long range. Get that runner.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Sam: 18.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: What's up, bro?
Liam: I'm not fast.
Taliesin: 13.
Liam: 13.
Travis: That's weird for you.
Taliesin: It's almost as low as I can go.
Matt: 13 for Pike? No, that's Vax. What's Pike?
Liam: Pike clocked in at four.
Matt: Pike is clocking in as Pike.
Liam: Yeah. Where's the remix of this song?
Taliesin: I know. (beatboxes)
Matt: All righty, so beginning of the round. Vex, you're up first.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine around here, so he can lash up and try to catch that wizard, the cloaked guy that's running away.
Matt: What's he have to roll for that?
Laura: He has to roll a dexterity save above 15.
Marisha: Get it! Get it, son!
Matt: That's an eight. He is running up the stairs.
Laura: So it snatches his ankle.
Matt: And then drags him.
Laura: Backwards. Then I'm going to shoot him twice.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Not that one. That one looks like he knows too much.
Laura: What is that? 32.
Matt: 32, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 14, plus four lightning damage. I don't get sneak attack on this guy, though?
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay. 14, plus four lightning damage, and then I'm going to hit him again. That is also a 32. No, that's-- well, it's very high. 27? 28
Matt: 28. All right, that hits. Roll damage. Grog, you're up next. You're in the back of the marching order.
Travis: We're not up at the top, are we?
Matt: No. So you've got at least 25, 30 feet before you can get to the top there.
Laura: 12, plus six lightning damage.
Matt: Nice. All right, 36 points of damage in one round. The arrows (impact) as he is pulled through the rock and rubble by the Grasping Vine that is currently wrapped around him.
Laura: I am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Grog, you're up.
Travis: As I hear the sweet melodical Miami Vice tunes of warfare being played, can I double dash up past my mates and into the fray?
Matt: Sure, so at 30 feet, it'll get you right at the edge of the stairs. Still have 20 more feet you can go.
Travis: Yeah, straight towards them.
Matt: All right, so that's there.
Travis: Then can I use dash to go the rest of the way?
Matt: To close the gap there? Sure.
Travis: Now, I only have my bonus action left, so can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may, yeah. All righty, so at that point you go into a rage.
Travis: That's my turn.
Matt: All righty, so now it is his turn.
Marisha: You have that guy? But this guy was the runner, I thought.
Taliesin: Yeah, but he's vined.
Marisha: Okay. He's currently grasped.
Matt: Okay, as soon as you rush up into his face, you hear the individual, the hood pulled back at this point. You see shaved entirely bald, older, late fifties to early sixties, missing one eye, but in that socket you can see a faint spark of arcane energy. Shouting out amongst the space, "Glory and reward is mine! Wraiths, go forth and devour, while I bring oblivion to them." As you rush up, is going to cast Wall of Force right in the space between there.
Marisha: Between him and Grog?
Laura: (singing) The space between.
Sam: (singing) Your wicked lies.
Matt: It pushes you back five feet, and now there is a Wall of Force that is blocking that side of the hallway from where he is.
Marisha: Him and the other guy? Or just between him? How big is it?
Matt: Sorry, the entirety of this chamber is the Wall of Force.
Marisha: Fucking fuckface.
Travis: What does Wall of Force do? Can I walk through that shit?
Marisha: Yeah, it just might hurt.
Travis: Will it?
Matt: As soon as the wall appears there, you see a slight short barrier that forces you back about five feet. You catch your back foot, and now as the barrier finishes shimmering, it's invisible. Looks like there's nothing there. He's grinning from there. He glances over to the right into the hole in the wall where his friend was earlier.
Travis: Which was that way, right?
Matt: As he glances over, he goes, "Odell, bring me the sphere." You hear the humming noise, the faint humming vibrational noise, now louder. That ends his turn. Actually, he is going to take a step back up onto the stairs there. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up? What can I do?
Matt: You're 20 feet down from the staircase.
Sam: My speed is 25.
Matt: That'll get you right up to about there, with five-foot steps.
Marisha: Don't let them leave!
Sam: Oh god, this looks like a crazy thing.
Travis: (counting) 60 is how far away he is.
Sam: Wow. There's a Wall of Force. Do I see a Wall of Force?
Matt: You don't. You actually rush up, and it looks like it's an open hallway right now.
Sam: Okay. I see Grog in attack mode, right? I see these two bad guys. I will send a Lightning Bolt at somebody.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: Looks like I can't see this guy because there is a pillar in between, so the other guy.
Matt: That's true, so it'll be that guy. All right. You'll have to move off to the side, or else you're going to hit Grog with the Lightning Bolt. It's going to be hard. He's up a few steps, though. You could probably aim it above and hit him without Grog. I'll let you do that. As you get to the top, you release your bolt of lightning. (crackling noise) It arcs forward, and as it gets right above Grog, it hits something solid and splinters. No effect.
Liam: So this Wall of Force visually is floor to ceiling?
Matt: You don't know; you don't see it. He saw a faint shimmer because something pushed him out of this space, but right now you have no visual perspective. That's going to end Scanlan's turn, I believe. All right. The other guy, who is currently held by the vine that falls limp off of his body--
Laura: It falls limp off of his body?
Matt: Well, it doesn't wrap around or keep him held. Every turn, it can pull something towards it. He's going to glance over towards the side, listening to what the other, Viskorad, said. Okay. At which point, that humming gets louder and louder.
Taliesin: He had the map. If he built the map, there's a way out.
Matt: You watch as a two-foot-wide black sphere of void-like nothingness comes carving through the stone wall immediately to the left of you, Grog, leaving a completely disintegrated form roughly the shape of its sphere. It's coasting in towards and into your space.
Travis: It's a Sphere of Annihilation.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: Oh shit, son!
Laura: Oh god!
Sam: Is someone controlling it?
Matt: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Oh my god, roll so well! Do you get advantage?
Travis: I do. I have Danger Sense. It fucks you up. Yeah, it hurts real bad.
Sam: I see this happening, right?
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You manage to duck out of the way as it enters the space, and you can feel this weird energy. Your beard is almost being pulled toward it, and the loud vibrating (vibration) hum before you. It's like staring into an absolute nothingness.
Travis: Take my life, but not my beard.
Marisha: Who looks like he's controlling it? Odell?
Matt: The guy who is being pulled by her is concentrating and moving it over, at that point.
Laura: Oh, the guy in red? The guy in red is controlling it!
Matt: All right. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: (yells)
Matt: I've got to rest for a second. Controlling enemies hurt. It's okay.
Sam: We can get dudes behind you to hold you up.
Matt: We'll see how I can do it. Keyleth, your turn.
Marisha: Oh my god. So much has changed from what I thought I was going to do.
Matt: You're about 25 feet down the staircase.
Marisha: Yeah. So I come up from the staircase.
Matt: Okay. That gets you up to the edge there, where the staircase stops.
Travis: Does the Sphere of Annihilation get an attack of opportunity if I run away?
Taliesin: Probably not.
Sam: Is it a thing? Is it a weapon?
Matt: It's a black sphere of void. One of the guys is looking focused, concentrating on it, and it moved under his willpower in the direction of Grog.
Travis: It's real bad.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to come up. I'm trying to think of what I have in range, and I'm terrified. And I'm going to stick with my original instinct and do Wall of Stone and try and wall these guys in so they can't run. I think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now.
Travis: They can, but at least they'll be here.
Taliesin: They'll have to move the orb to do that.
Marisha: Okay. I can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot panels, so I want to be a semicircle block off, bring up a whole wall of stone behind them.
Matt: Okay. Hold on a second.
Travis: Who can get to the other side? You have Dimension Door. But that's it, right? That's the only person that has that kind of a thing.
Matt: As you attempt to concentrate and create a Wall of Stone, you are unable to pick a point or an area beyond the barrier.
Travis: The Wall of Force? No!
Laura: Say it again?
Travis: And you need to focus, or is it a random?
Matt: It doesn't fizzle the spell. You have no area to release it on. The barrier, while invisible, is preventing targeting a specific area to create.
Taliesin: We need to dispel this shit.
Marisha: I do have Dispel Magic.
Matt: You've used your action to attempt it. You didn't lose the spell slot, but you spent your action attempting it.
Travis: Hey, man. That was a nice try.
Marisha: Can't cast through it.
Laura: Good to know. But the orb went through it?
Matt: No, the orb is on the other side.
Marisha: Even though it's a nature thing, going up underneath there, I can't get around it? No?
Matt: You're targeting on the other side of the wall. It has to be in visual range for you to create it to happen.
Marisha: (singing) I'll see you on the other side of the wall. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That's Keyleth's turn. No, sorry. At the end of Keyleth's turn, you hear this (breathy noise) sound as these two shadowy figures emerge from the nearby walls.
Liam: Ghosts! Shadows!
Travis: No. What? Ghosts or wraiths?
Marisha: Wraiths.
Liam: There's ten different kinds of things like that.
Marisha: Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth?
Taliesin: Oh shit, and look what they're doing!
Matt: This one hovers over and lands behind Keyleth. And it's going to attempt, as it seems to shift through the pillar--
Marisha: I look over my shoulder and go  Oh no!
Matt: This one here stays within the pillar, and it reaches out, as it's incorporeal, and strikes at you. That is 24 against you, Vex.
Laura: That hits.
Matt: All right. You suffer 21 points of necrotic damage, and I need you to succeed on a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Fuck! Come on.
Travis: My fucking god!
Sam: It's a 20? (screaming)
Matt: All right. Well, you suffer the 21 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 21.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: Until you finish a long rest. The other one's striking at you, Keyleth. That is a 16.
Marisha: Misses!
Matt: That's right, because your AC is 17 with the ring.
Marisha: That's right! I leveled up, motherfuckers!
Matt: All right. Cool. Technically, leveling up didn't affect your AC; however, calculating the magic item did.
Marisha: But I feated, so I'm good!
Matt: I know. So as it swings toward you, its claw streaks out and has no effect. And then they both vanish. You want to take an attack of opportunity? You can if you'd like to.
Marisha: War Caster?
Matt: War Caster. You can attempt to cast a spell on it as a reaction, if you'd like. This one's going to back away into the wall, as well. Vex, you also get an attack of opportunity if you'd like, with a melee weapon.
Marisha: Does it have to be a bonus action?
Matt: No, it can be an action. That's part of the War Caster feat.
Laura: I have a dagger, but I don't even have it drawn.
Matt: Then yeah, you're fine.
Liam: They're both out of visual range, right?
Matt: They both are now backing up.
Liam: One's in a pillar, and one went through a wall. Are they moaning and shit, in the wall?
Matt: You can't hear them.
Liam: I can't hear them. Can't see them, can't hear them. All right. Thanks.
Matt: No worries.
Laura: I have resistance to necrotic damage, by the way.
Matt: You do! Then you take ten points of necrotic damage, and your hit points are only reduced by ten.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now.
Taliesin: I have no ideas for anything.
Marisha: I have never done this before, but I have it learned. I will Ice Knife it in its face. Ice Knife! Level one, you create a shard of ice, fling it at-- oh, it's a flingy-thingy. But it's 1d10 piercing damage, and then it explodes?
Matt: Okay. It's right next to you. She has the feat where she can cast the spell as a reaction when something comes at her. Just know that whatever you're hitting is right next to you. So if it explodes, does any radial damage, it might come back and hit you.
Marisha: No, hit or miss, the shard then explodes, the target and each creature within five feet of the point where the ice explodes. Oh. I'm fine. I'm doing it anyway.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll to hit.
Travis: And Scanlan's in five feet of her?
Laura: No, he's behind her.
Taliesin: Oh, for fuck sake.
Marisha: What's wrong with us?
Laura: Wasted all of our 20s on goods.
Matt: Tonight is ridiculous.
Marisha: One.
Matt: All right, so as you release the Ice Knife, it slams into the wall. No effect. However, it does still explode, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So it does what damage?
Marisha: 2d6.
Matt: 2d6 damage. So go ahead and roll 2d6. To both you and the creature?
Taliesin: Yeah, all creatures within range.
Marisha: Technically, reroll ones. Three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, each creature. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes.
Matt: All right, so you take seven points of ice damage, and it hits the wraith. However, the cold damage doesn't seem to have as much of an effect as you would expect.
Laura: It's a fucking wraith!
Matt: That ends their turn. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: I hear a whole bunch of commotion, so I'm going to pop my head up out of the hole and see what the fuck is going on.
Matt: All right. You glance up and get just beyond where Keyleth is, pushing past. You have five more feet you can move if you want.
Taliesin: Well, I'm coming up the hole. I take a look. Oh, sweet god. I'm going to take a shot at the guy I see up on the table there.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's better.
Matt: Which guy?
Taliesin: Yeah, the gray. And that's 28?
Matt: Okay. (gunshot) You fire a shot and watch as it detonates against some sort of invisible wall that you didn't see was there before, scattering helplessly against the space in the air.
Marisha: I hate this force field shit.
Travis: It explodes near my head, and I'm like Stop shooting into this thing!
Taliesin: I'm going to drop back down the hall.
Matt: All right, you get right back down to right there. That ends your turn, Percy? Vax, you're up.
Liam: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to dance through to here, where I can see Grog and these guys, and I can see all my friends here, and I'm going to hold my action to attack anyone who comes right up to one of my friends within striking range.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Perfect. Ending Vax's turn, Pike's up.
Laura: Pike comes running up the steps.
Matt: She can get right up to here, and that's as much as she can move. She can still cast a spell if she wants to. She's going to cast Beacon of Hope for all of the allies within range, which is 30 feet.
Matt: All right, so that is everybody but Grog.
Laura: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: That's my fault.
Laura: That gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and any time you're healed, you regain the maximum number of hit points.
Sam: Even if we move out of the radius?
Matt: It affects everybody at that moment, and then you carry it with you.
Laura: Wisdom and death saving throws.
Liam: You got glitter-bombed with holy goodness.
Marisha: Wisdom and death plus what?
Laura: And full hit points when you get healed.
Taliesin: You don't roll; you get the max.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Matt: Okay. So ending Pike's turn brings us to the top. Vex, your turn.
Laura: Oh, great. Well, I've seen all the things explode. Fucking hell. I'm going to pull out my Vecna symbol, that necklace that we still had, and put it around my neck, because that fucking sphere is out and I don't know if it matters.
Matt: Okay, so you quickly throw it around your neck.
Laura: Do I still have control of the vine?
Matt: Currently, yeah.
Laura: Okay. And it's on the other side of the force?
Matt: This is true.
Laura: So I'm going to use it and I'm going to try to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is holding the force wall, right? But it probably is a concentration. The guy in red is holding the sphere.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: The guy in red is holding the sphere. I'm going to try to knock him down and see if I can break his hold on the sphere, maybe? Is that stupid?
Matt: He does not make his save. He isn't moved. It wraps around him and pulls him tight against the area where it is again, but it's barely shifted him, so he gets moved a few inches, but doesn't seem to affect him at all.
Laura: That's a bonus action. I still get an action.
Matt: Yep, and movement.
Laura: And movement. Oh god. I'm going to spread out. I'm going to come over here, maybe? Or here. Oh jeez. I don't know. I can't hit anybody! I'm going to wait. I'm going to hold my action until I see something getting through that fucking force wall.
Taliesin: Until there's something to hit.
Laura: So that I can attack him.
Matt: Sounds good. All right, Vex, that's the end of your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'm going to try and run through the Wall of Force. It's only five feet of my movement, and we'll see what happens.
Matt: All right, you slam face-first into a stone wall. Immediately, the anger fills through you, the familiar smell and taste of iron-like blood as you seem to have busted some element of your nose in the impact.
Travis: Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere? Not even an inch?
Matt: No.
Travis: What if I channel all the rage from my life, and I draw on the undead? Okay, cool. I'm going to turn around and run the other way.
Marisha: You didn't get through?
Travis: No, it didn't even give, apparently. (counting) 50, right there.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, that ends my turn.
Matt: This guy turns around and begins to make his way up the stairs and move double dash, and disappears up the stairs.
Marisha: (screams in frustration)
Travis: We can't do anything. Nobody knows Disintegrate or anything?
Marisha: Whose turn is it?
Matt: That finishes that guy's turn. It is now Scanlan's turn.
Sam: I'm going to take a few steps forward. I will inspire Grog, I guess.
Travis: Or yourself.
Sam: I'm okay.
Travis: Really? Okay.
Sam: I'll sing to him. (singing) Don't mess with that big black ball, it can really fuck you up. I really hate that big black ball, all it better do is miss you, make it miss you.
Matt: Oh my god, that was not my intent in creating this encounter. Take your d12 inspiration die.
Travis: Thank you.
Sam: And I guess I'll Dimension Door, try to go through the Wall of Force. We've tried this before, Matt. Who knows how this shit works?
Travis: And the previous ruling was it worked.
Sam: Yeah, but that could have been a gentle nod.
Matt: The wording is important on this.
Liam: I think the cultist shits his pants and his brain explodes. I think that's in the book.
Matt: I've had to look this up very carefully. With elements like this wall, it's a targeting thing. You cannot target something that is in full cover, total cover, which being behind a wall is. Teleportation, however, you're the target and Dimension Door and Teleport is unaffected by that.
Sam: Matt fucking hates this.
Marisha: Get the runner!
Sam: I don't know where the runner went.
Marisha: He went that way.
Sam: I don't see him, right?
Matt: You saw him run away, you just don't know where he is at the moment.
Sam: Can I gauge roughly how far he went down that hall? Do I see down the hall?
Matt: Not from where you were over there.
Sam: So I'm going next to the red guy.
Liam: Also, if you get out of range of Vex, Vecna knows all.
Laura: Oh yeah. Stay within 60 feet.
Matt: All right, so you Dimension Door there. That's your action.
Sam: That's my everything.
Marisha: We've got to take out these guys' eyeballs.
Matt: That's the end of your turn. At which point, Odell, who's standing there currently, is physically sweating, concentrating on this sphere right now. Looks over and sees you appear and goes, "Viskorad, the little one made it through!"
Sam: Who are you calling little?
Matt: At which point, you glance over your shoulder and you can see that the darting, cloaked one stops and spins and faces towards you.
Sam: That's not good for me, guys.
Marisha: It's not good for you, but it's good for us. Fuck them up!
Travis: Oh god.
Matt: That's as far as they can get. However, it completely disintegrates the central pillar. It is obliterated, like it lays with a top part and a bottom part, but wherever the sphere passes through, about a good six inches around it is turned to dust and is gone.
Laura: Oh my god, what if we fail these rolls?
Matt: He's then going to go back around--
Taliesin: No, he's grappled.
Liam: No, he's grappled.
Matt: No, it doesn't grapple. It just moves things toward it.
Marisha: You're confusing Entanglement with Grasping Vine. Two totally different things.
Matt: He's backing up, and he's looking over at the sphere, concentrating on it. You can see the beads of sweat pouring down his face, and he's glancing over nervously at you, but smiling at the idea that his friend is returning. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Seeing Grog slam into that. Ugh, fuck. This is a pretty beefy spell, yeah? Force Wall? Should I do fifth or sixth level to dispel this? Okay. Fifth or sixth level? Sixth level. I'm going to Dispel Magic this wall.
Matt: Okay. As you focus and concentrate, you release the essence of the Dispel Magic, the burst of arcane energy casts forth, and falls harmlessly against the exterior.
Laura: It's a higher level.
Liam: It's a higher level.
Marisha: Higher than sixth level? The spell.
Matt: Didn't appear to have an effect on the wall.
Travis: Come on, maybe it needed to be something else.
Liam: No. He did what Scanlan does with Counterspell. He beefed it up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You can move.
Marisha: It's higher than seventh level? Did you have to roll?
Matt: No effect on it.
Taliesin: Okay, it's going to be okay. Everything's okay.
Liam: So about that long rest...
Marisha: I don't know now, you guys.
Laura: We're fucked.
Marisha: I move forward. I guess. I don't want to move that far forward. No, I don't move that far forward! (laughter)
Marisha: I don't want to die!
Matt: That finishes your turn, Keyleth?
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Marisha: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Laura: Oh no, here they come.
Taliesin: Oh no, here they come.
Matt: They take minor damage being in the physical wall, but that's fine with them.
Liam: Boom, I attack! Sneak attack on the one near Keyleth.
Matt: Emerge. All right, so the one near Keyleth. Go for it.
Laura: What was I holding for? I was holding until I could attack something, or until I could get through the wall? I think it was through the wall.
Matt: The wall.
Liam: All right, 27 on that guy.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. So that is three, plus three is six, so ten. (counting)
Taliesin: If we can hit them, they're probably squishy.
Matt: You took out one of three between just two of your surprise attacks.
Liam: 34 for the first hit, and I have the second paladin attack, so if it's not dead, I will attack again.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That is eight for the second.
Matt: As it emerges from the wall, its blackened shadow form giving off small tendrils of dark black ether and abyssal energy, it reaches out to strike at Keyleth, and you immediately release two daggers in its direction. Both hit its form. It gives this pained sucking sound as you watch its beady, burning red eyes seem to blink in the pain, and it angrily lashes out at Keyleth, its form somewhat more disparate and unable to maintain a corporeal form.
Liam: When is Pike? Is it her turn? No? Okay.
Matt: No, she cast Beacon of Hope. So attacking against Pike. That is 21. What's her AC?
Laura: 23!
Matt: 23. It tries to strike at her, and she manages to take the shield and bash it away. The light from her mace arcing around causes it to flinch, and it actually strikes a little too wide. The one that's arcing towards you, Keyleth, that is fucking 16 again! Yeah, because it's plus six to hit. Okay. You dodge out of the way a second time. It's then going to move back into the wall over here. He's going to move back into the wall, as well. Both of you get reactions.
Laura: Pike definitely takes it. With her Mace of Disruption, she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage.
Matt: All right, so roll an attack on that one.
Laura: That's a 21 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I am wickedly out of my element. I'm running from an 8-ball.
Taliesin: We've got to get everyone away from that thing.
Laura: 27 for Pike.
Matt: 27 points of damage?
Laura: Is it a fiend or an undead? So it has to have a wisdom save of 15.
Matt: If it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, which it does not. That one has not taken a whole bunch of damage. However, it did take a relatively decent hit, and you watch as she swings the mace out. As it pulls back, where the mace impacts, it seems to almost evaporate part of the shadowed form, and it shrieks as it disappears into the wall.
Liam: For clarification, that is the one I hit, as well, right?
Matt: No, the one that you hit is where she was.
Liam: Oh, Pike hit the other one.
Matt: Correct. Keyleth, are you doing anything as a reaction?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to pull out my staff and do a Burning Hands on him. Dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Natural 20, so it takes half damage.
Marisha: Half damage.
Laura: Ooh, that's good. You did the six and the four.
Taliesin: And then there was a third one.
Marisha: And then there's a third one that is a six? Was that right? Six and six is 12, so 16.
Matt: 16 points of fire damage reduced by half which is eight, and even that impact seems to be lessened by the wraith-like being seemingly absorbing some of the heat from the impact.
Laura: Radiant damage is the bomb!
Taliesin: Radiant damage is what we need in here.
Matt: All righty, that ends their turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to stay in my little cubby hole. I've got some good visual on a couple of these guys down here. I'm going to yell at everybody to get the fuck away from the ball. I'm going to hold my attack until something happens that's going to give me something to shoot at.
Matt: Okay, so as soon as an enemy reveals itself that you can shoot. Okay, that ends Percy's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Fucking hell. I'm going to do the same thing except I'm going to move to here and wait for something to attack one of my friends.
Taliesin: That's awfully close to the ball.
Liam: I know it is. That's what I do. I'm waiting until one of them attacks one of my friends. One of the undead. I can't do anything about that. That's what I'm doing. That's my turn.
Matt: All right, Pike's turn.
Liam: Stupid, I know. That's what Vax does.
Laura: I can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up, right? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon. Should she do it at a second level? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like it's on fire.
Matt: Whereabouts? On the wall here?
Laura: No, near the wall, yeah. Up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing is down. And then she's going to hold her physical action until there's something that she can attack.
Matt: Okay, she's holding her physical attack?
Laura: Yeah, her mace.
Matt: Okay, that ends Pikes turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, that's me!
Matt: Yeah, that's you, actually.
Liam: You're Vex.
Laura: I'm Vex. I'm going to dart away from this ball as fast as I can, and I'm going to come up here.
Sam: Hey, you broke through!
Laura: I broke through the wall. I can't reach. I'm too fucking-- It's fine; I got it.
Sam: Make Matt stand up, Laura.
Matt: Please do. I appreciate it.
Laura: And I'm going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that I can attack.
Matt: Okay. All righty.
Marisha: I can't believe I couldn't fucking dispel that wall.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah, I am, aren't I? Okay. Cool.
Laura: Wait, I have bonus action still.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to use that Grasping Vine that I still have up, and I'm going to re-grab onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him towards the wall he's right in front of.
Matt: That's a 15. What's your DC on that?
Laura: 15.
Matt: He succeeds, unfortunately. It slaps out towards him and this time-- I forget the adage, but never mind. He dodges it. (laughter)
Liam: It took 425 hours, but we did it. We broke his brain.
Matt: Blame it on the painkillers. The vine whooshes out and tries to wrap around him. He dodges out of the way, and it slaps harmlessly against the stone and withdraws back into the small crack of stone where it's based. That ends your turn. All right, Grog.
Travis: I'm going to put my faith in Scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens. (counting) 30. Right up against the wall. Can I look to the left down that hallway? Can I see down there at all? Is it blocking the hallway off from vision? Is that a moveable space?
Matt: Looking off, it looks like the orb was being used to carve a path.
Travis: It hadn't finished doing it?
Matt: No. It was maybe 25 or so feet down and was hitting solid rock.
Laura: My spell DC may be higher. I don't know if I have increased that in a while.
Liam: It's eight, plus proficiency bonus, plus her spell bonus.
Laura: So my spell DC is 17.
Matt: You need to keep up on that, girl.
Marisha: That was how I lost to Grog in our battle.
Laura: I wanted it around his neck, just to make him annoyed.
Matt: It hits him against the wall. He's still glancing over his shoulder.
Taliesin: He's lost visual range of the ball?
Matt: No, he can still look over the rubble there.
Travis: Not enough to make a concentration check?
Matt: If that's what it does.
Travis: I'm there. I can't get into that hole anymore, can I?
Matt: Not with the way the Wall of Force is placed, no.
Travis: Fair enough. I will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance.
Matt: Okay, ending Grog's turn. At the top of the staircase--
Laura: Oh no! He's coming back for Scanlan!
Matt: This guy here, we'll say he got about that far from the stairs and continues that way.
Marisha: Sanctuary!
Taliesin: Like he's parting the Red Sea.
Taliesin: You shall not pass!
Marisha: You shall not pass!
Laura: Oh my god, we're going against Gandalf right now, you guys.
Taliesin: That's not Gandalf. That's a cosplayer.
Liam: Do you know many hobbits I have under my cloak?
Taliesin: Five hobbits in a cloak. That's all it is. It's not a wizard.
Matt: He glances down at the staircase where you are, and as he begins to smile, the flash in the eye begins to glow briefly, a pale comparison to Vecna, but there is an essence of energy lent to him from his worship of the newly risen deity. He begins to speak in a language you don't understand. And as he speaks one alien word-- how many hit points do you have?
Sam: A lot. 167.
Matt: Fuck, okay. I miscalculated. No effect.
Sam: Power Word?
Matt: Power Word  Stun. He assumed the smaller stature of the gnome was not as hearty.
Travis: He's upset that he miscalculated. The DM wants blood!
Liam: That's what he gets for profiling.
Matt: He's going to continue moving upward, 30 feet back up into the staircase as he keeps focusing on you. That's going to end his turn. You're up, Scanlan.
Sam: Hold on. I need to look up the range of a fucking spell. How far is he from me?
Matt: It's hard to tell at this point. You'd say somewhere between 50, 60, 70 feet.
Liam: I bet your spell is 120 feet, Sam.
Sam: I'm looking. That one's not.
Liam: Is it Thaumaturgy? Because that's right where your eyes are.
Sam: You said how far? Oh shit.
Matt: Between 50 and 70 feet from you.
Laura: You can move.
Liam: You can move.
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to move 25 feet towards him.
Matt: Okay, so that puts you up here.
Sam: And with my darkvision, do I get a sense for how far he is from me now?
Matt: Yeah, you'd say he's about 40 feet from you.
Sam: Fuck no, it's not. Shit, I need 30.
Laura: You can move five more feet. You've got more movement.
Sam: No. That's my movement. I have tiny little nubs.
Travis: Tiny little nubs?
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: What about long-range shit, man?
Sam: That's okay. Yeah, I've got longer-range shit, but it's not as bad news.
Marisha: Keep them from running away.
Travis: Damn it, Matt. Why'd you have to back up?
Matt: Because that tactically made sense.
Liam: Bigby's Hand him? Grab him?
Sam: I'm thinking. I'm trying to decide between two things.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on, let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel the love.
Marisha: This is all on you, man. This is all on you.
Travis: Do your thing. Listen, Shadow of War comes out October 10th. A lot of us are in it.
Sam: It's going to have a lot of wisdom. All right. I will Bigby's Hand. I assume he's got a lot of wisdom, so I will Bigby's Hand him. At level seven. And I will punch the shit out of him.
Laura: Punch him back toward us. Bigby's Hand on the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us.
Marisha: That's a good call.
Matt: All right, so that is 8d8 force damage if you hit. Roll a melee spell attack.
Laura: Inspire yourself!
Taliesin: Inspire yourself!
Sam: I didn't. I forgot. I rolled an 18.
Matt: 18 hits. He's a caster; he doesn't have a lot of armor.
Marisha: Kill him!
Matt: All right, so roll 8d8 force damage.
Taliesin: I have three.
Sam: And I've got one.
Liam: That's just some dude from Sea Org in a bathrobe. Punch him!
Taliesin: Wow, that was a deep cut.
Sam: Wait. Shit. What did I just roll? 16 plus four. That's 20. And then this is another-- 40.
Matt: 40 points of force damage.
Sam: 40 points of force damage.
Matt: All right, that's a 20 DC concentration check.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Come on.
Matt: 16. No.
All: Wall down!
Laura: Did we notice? Did we notice that the wall went down?
Matt: No, you don't see it.
Sam: I don't know. Right?
Matt: But Grog would feel it. Grog is sitting there waiting for something, as Bigby's Hand full-on sucker punches him in the body, and he slams against the steps and has to shake his head as he glances at the giant fist and down at you.
Sam: As a bonus action, can I do anything?
Matt: If you want to do a bonus action, you can't do Bigby's Hand again.
Sam: No, but can I throw something to see if it goes through the wall?
Matt: Sure. I'll let you do that. Roll an attack roll, just to aim it.
Sam: Sure. 17, plus I don't know.
Matt: What are you throwing?
Sam: Scanlan found these two really crappy daggers in the desk in the casino.
Matt: He pulls one of these jeweled daggers that he wore and throws it behind, and Grog, you watch as this dagger passes through.
Taliesin: I see that, and I take three shots at this fucker up here immediately. How far away is he?
Matt: Which guy? The who Bigby's Hand just punched? Okay, he is about 120 feet.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Bad News, then, because that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle. He's going to take that.
Laura: I'm going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me.
Taliesin: I can't use a bonus action, and I have to reload once, so I can only take two shots with my action. I can't take three. So two shots with Bad News. Here we go. That's a 25 and 27 to hit.
Matt: Both hit.
Taliesin: First shot is 22 points of damage. Second shot is not as good. 14 points of damage.
Matt: So as you fire those two shots, the echoing noise of Bad News's explosions echoes through the hallway and stairway above. Vex.
Laura: I'm going to sharpshooter him, the guy right in front of me.
Taliesin: There's a lot of noises going on in this place. I think it'll be okay.
Marisha: Oh, it's fine. There are tunnels collapsing and shit. It's fine. I'm not concerned about the noise at the moment.
Laura: 22 to hit?
Matt: 22 does hit.
Laura: 21 damage on the first. And then 19 on the second. That's also Sharpshooter.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: No, that's 19 to hit.
Matt: Gotcha. That hits.
Laura: 27 on the second.
Matt: All right, nice. The guy who's controlling the sphere, after the first arrow strikes him right in the chest, he looks and starts to run up the stairway, and as it does, you take aim with your second arrow and release it, and it hits the base of the skull. You watch him go down one of the stairs.
Taliesin: So the sphere is still there?
Matt: The sphere is still there.
Laura: But he doesn't have control over it anymore. This guy in red is down, so all that's left is the guy and the wraiths?
Taliesin: Was there a third guy?
Laura: We killed him. That was the first guy we killed.
Matt: That finishes Scanlan's turn, right?
Laura: Yeah, that was your turn.
Sam: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Okay. I run up as far as I can, 30 feet. Do I see this motherfucker?
Matt: Yeah, you see him. You have a 60-foot range of darkvision?
Marisha: Or I see the glimmering of Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you could probably see him okay. A little bit. It's very dark, but barely.
Marisha: Fireball! (laughter)
Taliesin: That's an answer.
Matt: As you rush up, from the edge of the staff, a bead of red light engulfs the hallway above in flames. You see a split second of him and Bigby's Hand's outlines before fire engulfs the space. Go ahead and roll damage on that. That's a natural 20 on his save, so he gets half damage.
Marisha: What the fuckballs?
Matt: I didn't even roll with advantage on that one.
Sam: You said Fireball on this guy? Bigby's Hand takes damage.
Marisha: Does he? Magical?
Sam: Yeah, he has hit points.
Taliesin: He could roll a save, though.
Sam: He could!
Matt: Let's check. Yep, it has no bonus, so you roll a d20 and see what you get.
Sam: 11.
Marisha: 29 points of damage.
Sam: It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points.
Matt: Yeah, it has your hit points.
Laura: That's amazing!
Sam: Yeah, it's me.
Matt: That ends Keyleth's turn. He's still alive. This one's going to move through the hallway here.
Marisha: He's still going after my ass?
Matt: This one's going after Pike.
Liam: I get to attack. I've been holding.
Laura: Pike gets to attack. Pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could, too.
Matt: So Pike gets her attack, and so do you.
Laura: So 20 to hit on Pike.
Matt: 20 to hit? That hits.
Laura: Where is my other d8? Here it is. (counting)
Liam: When you hold, does bonus action carry over?
Matt: Nope, just the action.
Laura: So it's 22.
Matt: 22. All right. And what's the saving throw?
Laura: Saving throw is 15.
Matt: 15. Four, no. As it comes out of the wall reaching for Pike, she swings wide with the mace. As it slams into it, there's a flash of divine energy. Her eyes seem to pulse with a matching burst of radiant power, and as it hits, the creature squeals and squeaks as the light from the mace actually dashes it from this existence or any other. That is scattered into nothing from the shadows.
Liam: I rolled an 18 and a one.
Matt: 18 hits. One misses.
Liam: Okay, so sneak attack. One.
Sam: One misses?
Laura: I know, right?
Liam: 39 for the second attack.
Matt: 39 for the second attack. All righty. And with that, as this one reaches out towards Keyleth, your dagger strikes the back of its body, and as it impacts, you watch as its shadowed form turns into nothing but a splash of dark, half-existing ether, which then fades as your dagger clatters to the ground motionless.
Liam: Back to the belt.
Matt: All right. Percival, you're up.
Laura: Kill him!
Taliesin: Reload. Going to take another shot.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Going to take a shot. Yeah, let's take another shot. Probably got a low AC. Let's make this a sharpshooter, just for fun. Yeah. That's a sharpshooter shot, so that's a 24 to hit?
Matt: 24 hits.
Taliesin: All right. So let's do (counting) 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 points of damage. (gunshot) The echo of the impact as you watch part of the lower jaw and throat of the cultist in the robe gets blown apart. He stumbles back onto the steps that he had barely started to get up off to and you watch and you hear the horrible coughing sound as his last moments of life are robbed of it as it tries to get back up and then stumbles right back and bleeds out against the steps.
Taliesin: We can still interrogate him. He doesn't have to be alive for that. Any other problems?
Liam: How's the ball doing?
Matt: It's hovering there in the center of the hall.
Laura: We can't do anything about that floating ball. Cover it with a handkerchief.
Marisha: You beat me to it, man.
Taliesin: Let's rifle through these guys' stuff. Which one do we want to interrogate?
Marisha: Keyleth goes up to the red robe.
Taliesin: Let's throw gray robe into the annihilation ball. Let's get rid of him.
Travis: Vax. Why don't you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming? Keep watch.
Laura: But stay within 60 feet. Everybody gather up around me again.
Liam: Sis, come up to where Scanlan is so I can go a little further ahead.
Matt: Everyone is barely still within 60 feet.
Taliesin: Everyone gather up. We're going to get our stuff.
Laura: Avoid the ball.
Marisha: Vax, can I borrow a dagger?
Liam: Yeah. I give her Whisper.
Marisha: I take it and I stab it in his other eye. Red robe guy.
Matt: Okay. (splat) Other eye is destroyed.
Sam: I'm going to use Bigby's Hand to grab the sphere.
Matt: Do you? Okay. Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs towards the sphere, and as Bigby's form attempts to grasp the chaotic point of destructive energy, Bigby's Hand suffers 26 points of force damage and is forced to pull back.
Sam: That's not so bad.
Matt: But cannot grasp it. Cannot move it. (electrical shock)
Laura: I'm going to rifle through the robes of red robe.
Taliesin: I'm going to get Odell.
Matt: That's the one she's rifling through.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. There was a third guy, right, that they killed early on?
Matt: Oh, the first guy. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.
Taliesin: Assume we're going through everybody and taking their shit.
Liam: I'm standing as far from Vex as I can, but I can't go much farther because obviously-- yeah.
Matt: Okay. Interestingly enough, based on the current scenario and what preparation has been, no money on them. They have no worldly possessions that are what you consider of use. They each carry a gnarled wooden wand that they've been using as a focus for their spellcasting. Beyond that, they have nothing on them except for the one that you shot has, you notice the left hand is withered and gray, the skin is pulled taut against the bone. But beyond that, there is no other possessions on them, beyond the symbol of Vecna they wear around their throat.
Marisha: How many of those symbols do we still have, and how many robes do we still have?
Laura: Well, we can grab their robes, I don't know how many of those we have, but I think we also have a necklace.
Liam: Also, we can have Pickle talk to one of these arseholes.
Taliesin: I think that's a good idea.
Marisha: The guy that I'm standing over, red robe, I'm going to rip his necklace off.
Matt: Okay. You tear it off.
Laura: I'm going to take his robes.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, we're taking all this shit.
Matt: So you take every set of robes. And these robes are different from the robes that you had seen in Thar Amphala before. These appear to be a little more ornate. They seem to have a little higher station, which is why it's interesting that beyond the robes and some basic undergarments and the wand, they have nothing on them. They are a sheer conduit of their own power.
Taliesin: Were they drilling? I want to take a little bit of an inspection. Were they drilling with this thing? Is that why they had it?
Matt: Looking around the pathway, you can see that a lot of the staircase probably was more caved in, but has been cleared out by the movement of this orb. It's being used as a form of excavation tool as they push deeper into the catacombs here.
Marisha: So they were holding on to that orb the whole time.
Laura: Yeah, the guy in the red was controlling it.
Marisha: Yeah. He didn't cast it, though. We didn't see him cast that.
Laura: It came out of the wall.
Matt: Yeah, it came out of that little gap on the side there.
Sam: I'm going to go over to the sphere and say to it: I command thee to respect my authority and obey me as your new master.
Matt: Are you trying to exert your will on the sphere?
Sam: I'm intimidating the sphere.
Matt: Make an intelligence arcana check.
Sam: Intelligence arcana check?
Matt: Just an arcana check.
Sam: Oh! 19.
Matt: 19? And you're standing right next to the sphere to push your will into it?
Sam: Yeah, I came closer to it.
Matt: Okay. As you stand there, you focus on the orb, and you can feel your will push past the event horizon of the sphere. However, the force is too strong inside, and as you pull out of it instinctually, it moves towards you. (screaming)
Taliesin: Why did you have to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature?
Matt: Yeah. Ten feet. Which is right where you are, so I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Matthew McConaughey is going to reach out of it for you.
Sam: That's not good. 11.
Matt: 11?
Sam: Bigby, save me!
Matt: The orb pulls back and slams into the edge of his gnomish face and chest, and you watch as his flesh is pulled towards and disintegrated at the exterior of the sphere.
Laura: Can we reach down and grab him away from it?
Marisha: Yeah, Grasping Vine!
Matt: You take 30 points of force damage, and it's currently now right in your square, right up against you.
Laura: I use my Grasping Vine and I yank him away from it.
Marisha: Yeah, move away!
Matt: Okay. So you all push him out of the way and the vine pulls him.
Travis: Two-Face!
Matt: Yeah, you look a little rough.
Laura: Scanlan, you're hideous now.
Sam: Don't look at me! I'm fine.
Travis: Some other voice starts coming out of him.
Sam: I think I can take this thing.
Liam: "So did you want me to talk to one of these guys?"
Matt: You got the sense that there is a way to exert your will over it the way these guys did, but in that moment, your will faltered, and you didn't quite understand the nature of the sphere.
Sam: I just need to try again harder.
Marisha: Wait!
Laura: You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you give yourself inspiration?
Sam: This is an ability check, right?
Matt: This is an ability check, yes.
Taliesin: Wait, was that a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: No. It was an arcana check.
Travis: It might be high, dude. You might have to roll a 30.
Taliesin: Let's leave it. Tend to the sick and leave the well alone.
Travis: Indiana? Let it go.
Laura: Or Dominate that shit.
Sam: I'll try one more time.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: All right. Let's all back up.
Laura: I get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him.
Matt: Okay. And everyone else backs up a little.
Marisha: Keyleth stares with a vague familiarity.
Sam: I'm going to inspire myself.
Matt: Okay. So make your roll first, as you begin to focus and exert your will towards it. You add it on to it.
Sam: Pretty good.
Laura: Now inspire!
Sam: And inspire?
Matt: Up to you.
Sam: Okay. Plus my what? Arcana?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ooh, that's a lot. 30.
Matt: Okay. As you this time begin to push your will towards the sphere, you push past the event horizon, your consciousness connects with some--
Sam: (garbled) Listen to me, damn it! Respect my authority!
Matt: Some ancient space of the void within this blackened circle. As it connects-- What's your intelligence modifier?
Sam: Plus three.
Matt: Okay. What are you trying to will it to do?
Sam: I'm trying to will it to-- Shit, it's just a big black ball. Slam straight into the ceiling!
Matt: It moves up ten feet and then it hits, devours the stone above it to create this small tunnel right directly above.
Laura: Oh my god! You did it.
Sam: We can use it!
Taliesin: Finally.
Sam: Have you guys seen The Explorers?
Taliesin: I'm in The Explorers, motherfucker. I'm in The Explorers.
Sam: You are?! That's one of my favorite movies of all time! Can I get your autograph?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: Were you kidding? Are you really in The Explorers?
Taliesin: Yes! I'm really in The Explorers.
Liam: Stop the game!
Taliesin: I'm one of River's little brothers. I'm Ludwig.
Sam: Oh, wow!
Marisha: Yeah, he knew River through that.
Laura: What if we use the orb and go straight up? We don't even keep tunneling, we juat go straight up to the city.
Sam: It only listens to me.
Laura: Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or anything?
Sam: No, this is a cool thing.
Travis: Yeah, but it only makes a hole its size. It's two feet across.
Taliesin: I think he's not ready to pop a wheelie on this thing yet.
Travis: Plus, remember the guy was concentrating super hard, so it's the only thing Scanlan will probably be able to do.
Marisha: But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are The Champions?
Sam: Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't! We'll never make it! Yes, we can!
Liam: All I'm thinking is I could come up and do Lay on Hands and heals, but I'm like, you made your bed, lie in it.
Taliesin: Yeah, no. I'm okay with this.
Laura: What do you think? Do you want to go up?
Sam: We're still investigating these guys and stuff.
Marisha: Fuck these guys! We got all their shit. Let's go!
Sam: I'm going to call this ball Simon 3.
Travis: Do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement?
Matt: You watched him push it, and it went about 15 feet.
Travis: The sphere can only move 15 feet.
Sam: It will slow us down.
Matt: It's a very slow-moving ball of destruction.
Taliesin: Bring the sphere back down so that we can throw their bodies into the sphere so that they don't turn into undead fuckwads.
Liam: Wait a second, though! God, I don't know what this will do. I have a spell called Zone of Truth.
Laura: So it forces them to speak the truth? Does it work on undead?
Liam: A creature that enters the spell's area for the first time. If it fails.
Laura: So you could cast it, and then Pike could cast Speak with Dead, and it would come up into the Zone of Truth.
Liam: That's right.
Travis: No, they have to tell the truth when you do Speak with Dead.
Liam: No, they don't.
Matt: They don't have to.
Marisha: They can lie.
Taliesin: Here's a weird question  what saving throw do they have to make to speak the truth?
Liam: An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. So it could avoid the questions.
Laura: But they have to answer the questions.
Liam: But they have to answer the questions because of the other spell.
Laura: Right?
Sam: Double mumbo-jumbo?
Matt: It can't tell a lie, as you're discussing this. Technically, a creature would be unable to lie in the area.
Liam: Unable to lie, and with Pike's spell--
Laura: They have to answer the question.
Liam: They have to answer the question.
Matt: Let me double-check for you.
Taliesin: And what's the save?
Liam: Charisma saving throw against my spell save DC, which is not huge.
Marisha: What is it?
Liam: 16.
Matt: I mean, it does have to answer.
Liam: I like it.
Taliesin: Are we going to try this crazy shit?
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: Might as well. Okay, hang on, though! What are we going to get from this guy?
Laura: Find out how close we are to Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah, what's the plan? What are they trying to do?
Liam: What has Vecna got cooking?
Taliesin: What's Vecna planning? How many of them are there?
Marisha: I'm going to go pee, you guys.
Liam: He might not know everything. How long does it take for Keyleth to pee?
Laura: No, but how close we are to Vasselheim? What's the plan of attack in Vasselheim? How big is his army? We get five questions, I think, with Speak with Dead.
Taliesin: Five?
Sam: How close are we? What's his plan? Where is he?
Laura: Where is Vecna within the city?
Sam: Who's with him?
Laura: Who's the death knight?
Taliesin: He might not know that. But what are they excavating for? What are they looking for?
Travis: I think I know that.
Taliesin: I think I know, too, but I want to hear him say it. It'd make me feel better.
Laura: Let's do it! Cast your Zone, yo!
Taliesin: Get in the zone.
Laura: (singing) Autozone!
Matt: (chuckling) Autozone of Truth?
Liam: Shit. So can anyone drag him down on his roll to save, or boost me?
Taliesin: No. Not me.
Laura: I don't think so.
Liam: Does anyone have a cantrip? Okay. All right. Let's do it.
Matt: All right. So which one?
Liam: Well, first Zone of Truth, then Pike.
Matt: Okay. So you create the Zone of Truth, you create the area, the radial space where the divine energy kicks in and the compulsion to not lie remains within. And then Pike--
Laura: Casts Speak with Dead.
Matt: On which corpse? There are three corpses.
Liam: Red robe seemed more fancy.
Sam: Who seemed more senior?
Liam: Red robe did.
Matt: There are three, technically.
Sam: There was the guy they killed right when they burst on the scene.
Taliesin: We'll take the fanciest cloak.
Matt: Okay. It's relative, but the guy who was controlling the sphere seemed to be at least different.
Laura: He had a different color. Yeah, red robe.
Matt: All right. So as Pike takes the time to focus and recite the incantation, she grabs her holy symbol and focuses and speaks aloud the words in Celestial of the blessing of Sarenrae. And as she completes the ritual, she suddenly screams out in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her knees. No effect. And she suffers--
Laura: Oh no! What did he do to Pike?
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: On 6d6, I rolled four sixes and a five. That's 31 points of psychic damage to Pike.
Liam: She tried to cast Speak with Dead Dumbfuck.
Matt: She's shaking and grabbing her face and rubbing her eyes, and it takes her a moment to come back to you and she looks around, and you can see a faint bit of blood slightly dripping out of the corner of her eyes. She's like, "All I heard was laughter."
Sam: Laughter?
Laura: And you said it was minus 36 damage?
Matt: 31.
Liam: Vecna is in these motherfuckers' brains.
Marisha: Everyone looks upset.
Laura: Pike got psychic damage from that dude.
Marisha: How much? A lot?
Laura: 31 points of psychic damage.
Marisha: Oh, that's a lot, yeah.
Taliesin: Burn the bodies. Fuck it.
Marisha: Throw them down the well.
Taliesin: Throw them into the sphere.
Marisha: Oh yeah!
Sam: Sphere! Do your worst.
Matt: One by one, you grab and take the corpses and thrust them towards the sphere, as they immediately crumple, fold and get pulled in, turned to nothingness, disappearing into the black void. There are elements of the way the sphere acts and manipulates things that remind you of the siphons, though differently. It's more violent in some ways, and it is its own contained magical entity. With each body, it vanishes in the sphere, and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath and deciding the next order of business in traversing the insides of this titan. And that's where we'll end tonight's game, because it's 11:30.
Marisha: I feel like I always come back from the bathroom right as we're ending games.
Sam: First of all, it's so great to be back!
Taliesin: It's so nice to be back.
Sam: Matt, thank god you're totally 100 percent healed and all better again.
Matt: It's great. Sorry. But yeah, missed you guys. We'll be back next week, pick up from here, see as the final charge gets closer and closer. What will you guys do next time? In the meantime, rest well, don't forget, if you can, to give to the Red Cross to help support the victims of recent hurricane battering in the US.
Laura: Look for Shadow of War.
Matt: Shadow of War coming out on October 10th.
Marisha: Our comic on Wednesday.
Matt: Yep, look for that. And we'll see you guys soon. Have a wonderful week, we love you, and: Is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]
