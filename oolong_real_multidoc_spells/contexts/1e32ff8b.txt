[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone! Welcome to Critical Role tonight! We have some interesting adventurous points to go over. We're also coming off International Tabletop Day, which we had a great time. Met a lot of the wonderful fans, one of which had created their own t-shirt of our group and inspired us to do the same! So you'll see a bunch of us wearing our fantastic, full assortment of Critical Role party member t-shirts tonight. Just for fun. In the meantime, let’s go ahead and get this started, as we all have the chance to warm up with character backgrounds and maybe a little surprise. So be back here in a few minutes, guys! (drumming battle music) (drumming battle music continues)
Ashley: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream. A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! ...also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this... well this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. (weapon crack) Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike, that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. (brawling sounds) Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! ...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for... lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first Impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder crack) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third child of 7 children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men. As they ran, Percy’s sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (sound of a gun cocking and firing)
Sam: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he’s never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it’s rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes. I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Singorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn’t last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (dragon roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough, (ringing weapons SFX) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her. Born of a human mother, and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Singorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear - her own stolen Trinket - to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.
Matt: Welcome back, everyone! The new intro tonight, which I think we're all pretty damn proud of, was put together by our fantastic overlord, Zac. (all cheering)
Matt: It put him to work for quite some time, also the mixing and sound effects done by the amazing Alex Neat and the music you heard was composed by the amazingly talented Jason Charles Miller. So if you don't know Jason you should look him up. He's done stuff for The Guild and many other web shows. Also a fantastic musician on his own with his own stuff. He is the lead singer of Godhead. He's just a good guy. Also a voice actor, look him up if you have any time. Good people, and he lent his talents to our intro so we really appreciate that, buddy. Also we had a great time at Tabletop Day. Got to meet some of our fans. Got to take some pictures. Bunch of cool folks. Some of us got to go on the stream at certain points in the day. All around a good time! So those of you that got a chance to come, thank you so much! And a fan created, as I mentioned before, this awesome t-shirt with the roster, so we were all really inspired to go ahead and make some of our own. Got the party showing off their Critical Role positive.
Marisha: So one of the things we were actually talking about doing, so we'd like to give a shout out to the person who made this, big shout out to @RuzGofDi. Thank you! For doing this. A lot of people have been asking for shirts. I don't know if you guys maybe would be into that or not. So we thought maybe we would wear these, see what you guys thought. But if you guys are into it, we thought about doing a limited run of these and making this the first of our fan-designed t shirts.
Sam: First of many.
Marisha: First of many. Every once in awhile we'll have fans submit designs and then we'll pick a winner. Each one will be a limited run. So if you guys will like this, let us know, and maybe we'll make it happen.
Sam: I'm wearing one right now in my underpants, which we will be selling next week.
Marisha: Yes, and there might be some stills of that to order.
Orion: I'm going to wear mine next game.
Taliesin: Next game.
Matt: I guess some people are into the idea, let the chat know. People seem to be, and we'll be putting more designs out, getting some shirt possibilities to you guys in the near future.
Marisha: Let us know in the chat guys.
Liam: Wait wait wait, I've got some thing. I just gave everyone in the party rupees, treasure!
Marisha: Rupees!
Liam: These were sent to me by Tim West who has a great new company called Fantasy Coin HQ. If you go to fantasycoinhq.com he makes - Matt's holding up a dwarven coin at the moment - they make gems, they make fantasy coins, nerd coins.
Sam: Are we doing free ads now for people?
Liam: This is just a thank you!
Matt: This is a thank you.
Liam: Check it out. Or if you just hit a really tall tuft of grass with a sword, these will pop out of it so you don't have to order them. Just mow your lawn.
Marisha: They’re hefty, too.
Orion: If these were rupees, this is what they would feel like.
Marisha: I kind of want to throw them at people across the room!
Orion: I want to trade them, put them in a pouch.
Matt: Also guys, as a note, we have, available tonight for the person, for people who have managed to get themselves to 2,150 subscribers tonight, we will send out another promo kit to one of you folks in the chat with another signed picture of our Critical Role cast. So be sure to see if we can get the subscribers to climb up as well, so keep an eye out for that in the evening so we can give out one of those before the night is over. That would be awesome.
Sam: Let's do this!
Matt: Let's kick into the game proper, guys! Let's get some proper music playing, because that's what I do.
Orion: That’s what I baby do right.
Sam: (Beatboxing)
Matt: So last we left off, music's not playing here. I need music!
Sam: Doesn't matter.
Matt: The music's important to me! The party had been travelling into the dwarven city of Kraghammer at the behest of arcanist Allura Vysoren in search of a halfling paladin, a very revered folk hero named Lady Kima of Vord who had gone missing following a vision quest somewhere beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer, supposedly for some great evil that was germinating there, festering and growing. After you guys traversed through the dwarven city, you began to find your way down into the mines. The mythril mines of Greyspine beneath the dwarven town. After a few fateful encounters, the return of your gnome cleric.
Ashley: Hey, that's me!
Matt: Grog having his proverbial brains blown out by an intellect devourer. The party then decided to make friends with a mind flayer, an illithid that had been cast out from its people seeking vengeance and possible return to its people. Upon making this alliance, they made an attack on the dwarven, or the duergar, war camp that is threatening to rise up and attack Kraghammer from deep within the mountains themselves. The attack was successful. The general was killed, interrogated, and some interesting information was gleaned from him before his brain was sucked out from his head by Clarota, the mindflayer friend. However, this attack also announced to the local war camp of your presence and in the process of attempting to escape, the druid was damaged and lost her eagle form and thus began a freefall of many party members. A haphazard attempt to use the magic carpet far over its weight limit led most of the party to come crash landing and nearly killing everyone. Managed to escape, walled themselves in thanks to Keyleth’s stone wall spell. And after staying the evening in one of the deeper tunnels, and barely avoiding a roving band of duergar there, you managed to find yourselves in battle with 2 ogres carrying some sort of strange, mutated, black pudding ooze contained in a glass container. The glass container being shattered, of course, by an explosive arrow created by Percy and fired by Vex.
Laura: Go us!
Matt: At the very start of the battle, led into a very rough battle with this strange mutating ooze that kept splitting and splitting, until through some good teamwork, crafty use of telekinesis and a nearby lava pool, and general high damage rolls, you guys managed to survive the encounter.
Travis: Barely.
Matt: Making your way to the bottom of this tunnel, you found yourself looping back around to the large crevice where the giant waterfall had fallen in before, where you had met Clarota. Which allowed you to retrieve your bear Trinket.
Laura: Yeah! Trinket!
Matt: We pick up as you guys begin to step down into the lower tunnels, the ones that are partially coated with a series of magma pools and falls that are trickling out of the rockside. All right everyone.
Sam: I was just so out of it last time. Have we rested? Are we in some need of rest?
Laura: We should probably rest.
Sam: What are we around? What's near us? Is this just a tunnel? Is there any sort of shelter, caves?
Laura: We're by that lake with the giant monster.
Liam: We circled all the way back around.
Sam: Oh shit.
Laura: And went down to that place that you told us not to go in the first place? Yeah, that's where we ended up.
Sam: How was that for you? (all laugh)
Matt: So essentially there was--
Sam: We're back in the camp.
Matt: You're under the camp. You're where the giant chasm leads down into the waterfall. There is a pool of water at the bottom where the aboleth was in the water.
Liam: We just barely survived the chat room and now we need to rest.
Travis: (chuckles) The chatroom. Take it easy on us, all right?
Matt: You guys also just woke up about 2, 3 hours ago.
Laura: Right, so we don't really - oh, we can take hit points.
Matt: You guys can take a short rest and use your hit dice to heal up. You didn't take any damage last game. Thankfully you stayed out of the fray.
Sam: So I'm okay. That's all I need to know.
Matt: You did use one of your Dominate spells.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Only thing of note. So the rest of you who need to heal up can use this time to take a short rest and use your hit dice to heal up on your own.
Travis: I'm ready. Who we fighting next?
Sam: Anyone need some healing? Are we all okay? Are we all good?
Ashley: I think we're all good. Where's everybody at in terms of...
Orion: Well, I'm fine.
Laura: On a personal level, or?
Ashley: You mean like in life, or?
Sam: As we survey the area, how many tunnels we looking at? What's our options here?
Matt: So, (all laugh)
Travis: He's back, he's back.
Orion: Would you calm down?
Matt: Let me pull out this visual aid for you. This is the tunnel sequence you guys have traversed down to the main area where the goblin encampment was. This is the large bridge that went across the giant chasm to where the duergar war camp was. This is the giant drop-off at the waterfall. You guys are currently in this section about to go deeper into this tunnel where a series of small magma trickles are pouring out of the rock.
Sam: So we never went up to the war camp and through it.
Matt: You did.
Sam: Oh we did!
Liam: We crashed down by the tunnel, we fled. We sealed up the way behind us, ran in.
Sam: Got it. So we should keep going? We should just keep going. Magma? Follow the magma.
Liam: Well I recommend. We don't want to go up and through the camp again?
Laura: No no no, we're going into the cavern.
Liam: So we're going to backtrack the way we came to that war camp road, yes?
Laura: No, we're going into the tunnel.
Sam: Did you see the visual aid?
Orion: Yes, we are going into the lava tunnel.
Laura: No no no, in through the tunnel.
Liam: I’ll just follow. I thought I understood.
Matt: (laughs) It’s been a week.
Sam: I mean there might be something to be gleaned from going back to the war camp.
Laura: That tunnel.
Liam: We went out of there.
Laura: No no no no no.
Matt: You guys came through here, you traveled across over the war camp, went back here and tunneled below.
Laura: And popped this out right there. So now we're going into this.
Matt: Correct. Maps.
Liam: And just to make sure that my memory is on point--
Travis: It's not.
Liam: --Before we circled back around, we hit a fork in the road where we could have gone up and we could have gone down.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: So that's behind us.
Laura: That's behind us, we're going down down down.
Liam: Cheers.
Matt: Cheers indeed, huzzah. All right.
Laura: Shall we?
Ashley: We shall!
Sam: Is Clarence with us still?
Matt: Clarota is indeed with you. Clarota took a large black iron duergar bolt to the chest earlier and is mostly recovered but is still even more hunched than usual.
Laura: Does he need healing?
Ashley: He also ate those brains.
Matt: The brains helped him--
Ashley: Helped him a little bit?
Matt: --keep healthy, but he's still a little wounded but he's taking his time to rest up. He seems to be okay. Not as worse for wear as he was before. A slight wheeze that's always to him still present.
Ashley: He's just always a little weezy.
Laura: (meh meh meh sounds)
Liam: (meh meh meh sounds)
Matt: Sounds just like that. So, as you guys begin to push down into this lower chasm, the temperature of the air itself grows steadily warmer and warmer with a drier heat.
Orion: This feels nice.
Matt: You find yourselves, especially those of you with thick armor--
Ashley: Oh, it's so hot!
Matt: --You find that sweat beads begin to trickle down the side of your face--
Ashley: I'm sweating!
Marisha: You're all glisteny!
Matt: --And begin to pool and gather in parts of your chestplate.
Sam: Pike, if you'd like me to hold your armor or do you want me to take it off for a little while?
Ashley: No, I'll keep it on just for safety.
Sam: Let it hang out a little bit?
Liam: Do you even lift, bro?
Sam: Just saying, you might feel more comfortable with a loose fitting sort of cloak?
Laura: Scanlan, stop being creepy!
Sam: I'm not creepy! I'm just trying to be mindful!
Ashley: No, it's fine Scanlan.
Travis: Very considerate of you, a gentleman's offer.
Ashley: Yeah, it’s okay. I'll keep it on.
Sam: I'll just have to use my imagination.
Marisha: A gentleman's offer, yes. That's what we'll call it from now on.
Travis: What permission?
Sam: Onward.
Matt: Pressing further down, the air itself that once had a kind of a hint of that sulfur smell, is now becoming stronger and stronger as you step deeper and deeper into this cavernous tunnel. It rests about 30 feet to 40 feet at width and about 25, 30 feet up and it varies to come pinched tighter or wider at moments, but it continues to be a steady downward climb in a continuous direction. The small trickles, some of them pool and gather into these small, magma cups if you will. Molten hot magma, I knew it was coming.
Orion: (murmurs) I was just wondering if it would happen.
Matt: Ooh, that's minus 200 experience points. (all laugh)
Orion: I feel a bit weaker now.
Matt: You get about 20 or 30 minutes deeper into this tunnel before the sweltering heat gets noticeably warmer and as you crest a slight incline and decline over a small hill portion of this tunnel, you can see now a large portion of the rock has collapsed on the left side and a gargantuan pool of magma is pooling into the tunnel, essentially covering half of the tunnel you are traversing down. It can be walked on the side of safely at about 2 or 3 at shoulder width, but you only have about a 15 foot width here and the rest of it is just extremely bright, hot, molten rock.
Laura: Does it hurt us to get near it?
Matt: No, but it's uncomfortable and something to be very aware of and to watch your step.
Orion: I feel great!
Matt: You feel great.
Liam: I would just like to point out that we're 9 adults playing don't touch the hot lava at the moment. (all laugh)
Sam: Keyleth, you don't have any way of - say it gets hotter than this? You don't have any way of getting some water out here?
Orion: Ooh! I do! And I pull out an empty bottle.
Laura: Oh? Oh?
Liam: Tiberius, I've seen that bottle a lot. What does it do?
Orion: Oh! Um well, uh. I pull out two bottles. This one - they're both empty bottles - but this one is an air bottle and this one is a water bottle.
Liam: Oh! Thank you! That clears that up! (all laugh)
Travis: Even I feel dumber right now. (all laugh)
Sam: Your intelligence is now 4. (all laugh)
Travis: 4...3 and a half.
Liam: Does it make a lot of water?
Orion: Oh! This, if we ever need air--
Sam: I think that's the water one that you just pulled out.
Orion: I take it out (wind SFX). I control a small gust.
Laura: Yes, but what about water? Oh my.
Orion: This, if we need water - And I do a small stream.
Matt: Okay. So a little bit of water just begins to pour perpetually, and without seeming end due to the size of the bottle.
Sam: It's like a piss stream!
Laura: Oh, nice!
Orion: So, if you want to just squirt - and I do a small, little squirt-blasts on Scanlan.
Sam: Ahh!
Laura: Oh, okay. Lovely.
Liam: Is that unlimited?
Orion: Well, of course it is! Why would I carry a non-magical item on me? That's ridiculous.
Ashley: Just a water bottle.
Orion: So yes, Scanlan, we're fine.
Sam: That's good to know.
Laura: So, should we try to cross this little path here?
Ashley: That sounds cool!
Sam: That's really cool.
Laura: Can I use my tracking to see any of those duergar? To see if any of them have passed through the area; if there's a large group of them ahead of us?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: I can use my tracking and my favored terrain to see how many within 6 miles, if there's a large group of them.
Matt: Yes you can. All right. Go ahead and roll for your tracking check on that.
Liam: First roll.
Matt: I believe it's survival.
Laura: Ooh! Here we go!
Travis: Do it for the Star Wars trailer.
Marisha: Roll. Roll. Roll.
Matt: This is with advantage, I believe, because it's your favored terrain, correct?
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: (singing) Your favored terrain!
Laura: Okay, that's better. Is that it?
Liam: Survival.
Laura: 21?
Matt: 21! All right. You take a moment, and about 30 to 40 feet, you go through and inspect the way the terrain's been pushed and the dirt has been shoved aside. Tracking footprints and scuff marks on the rock and the walls nearby, seeing if any of the flows have been interrupted recently, and you ascertain that there is actually a pretty continuous patrol through here. About once every 4 to 8 hours up and down this tunnel that contain anywhere from 5 to 10 or more duergar, sometimes other, larger creatures. You find footprints that resemble maybe the ogres you mentioned earlier, possible troll footprints, but you're not familiar with that entity. You also notice some of the walls have what looks like small, localized cave-ins, almost as if something had burrowed through at one time or another.
Travis: Awesome. Great.
Matt: Large, large creatures. So, there's also things that exist outside of the tunnel system.
Ashley: Like Tremors?
Laura: So, as quickly as possible, we should get through these tunnels, I assume?
Matt: Probably a good idea. As a note though, you said within 6 miles?
Laura: Yes.
Sam: 6 miles?!
Matt: As you continue tracking down this tunnel - and it takes you a good 3 or 4 hours to finally reach a point where the tunnel begins to widen up - you assess that, maybe 3 miles up, there is a localized town. Or, at least, a population of duergar amassed in a central place.
Liam: Check out the brain on Brad!
Laura: So 3 to 4 miles up, you said, from where we are at this point?
Matt: Yeah. From where you began.
Travis: Should we be stealthing?
Laura: We should probably start stealthing at this point, yes.
Liam: Yes. I was about to say I'd like to move ahead of the group a bit and start sneaking along.
Matt: Let's do that! Go ahead and roll stealth.
Liam: Do I have advantage like my sister had for--
Matt: You do not.
Liam: No. All right, well--
Laura: Should we all try to stealth?
Liam: 26 for me.
Matt: This would be a group stealth check.
Liam: 26. I've tiptoed away.
Sam: 19.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: 7.
Travis: 17.
Ashley: 7.
Laura: 20.
Liam: 26.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: (laughs)
Matt: Picking up on the shortcomings of a handful of members of your group, you do manage to maintain what you feel is a fairly stealthy advance deeper into this tunnel system. About an hour and a half of perpetual travel, as the tunnel slowly widens further and further, with every quarter mile or so, you eventually get to a point where the tunnel shoots open into a gargantuan cavern. A chamber nearly a mile and a half across from this visual point.
Ashley: (quietly)...of secrets?
Matt: It is extremely tall, with hundreds of very jagged stalagmites hanging from the ceiling, and rock formations that rise and fall at different points of the topography. This entire tunnel is built in this strange, large, natural, downward curve that disappears out of sight about a mile ahead and to the left. But this huge tunnel is lit with what looks like maybe 2 to 3 dozen various small lava falls that are pouring down the sides of this giant cavern's structure. You also see some small pockets of that red glow stone that a lot of these Dwarven tunnels tend to use as a light source. You also, as you begin to step into this, carefully - you, taking point on this, both the twins; you notice - on the far end of this cavern… Well, first off, the entire landscape is rough and craggy, with large, black, obsidian spikes just jutting out of the ground at various points. Whether it be seismically created or otherwise, it's a very unwelcoming atmosphere. And that sulfurous smell is extremely strong. Even though you’ve gotten used to it as far as you can for this travel, it’s still a very pungent odor and you find that it’s going to be very difficult for you to make out any other scent in this location right now other than that horrible mixture of chemicals that probably isn’t very healthy to be breathing at the moment. What you see across the chamber, your eyes focus on a small cluster of buildings, it looks, of a similar construct as the barracks that you saw at the war camp. You can probably surmise somewhere in the neighborhood of about 20 to 25 of these structures, all localized in this one area that is punctuated with - you can count about 7 of these black obsidian spires that rise out at different points around like watchtowers.
Liam: Still natural?
Matt: No, these are constructed. These are very smooth and have that rigid Dwarvish construction with a jagged edge to each one of the leveled lips of these towers. The one that you can see closest to you, which is about a quarter mile off, you can just barely make out what looks like a couple of duergar walking across one of the upper levels and what looks like some sort of ballista and/or anti-personnel weapon that is put--
Laura: This is where Kima’s being held.
Sam: How do you know that?
Laura: She had a vision.
Orion: Plus, it’s a really big thing.
Sam: That’s true.
Matt: These giant bolt-throwers currently reside on each one of these, and then in the center of this cluster of buildings, you see standing a gargantuan ebony fortress. Serrated stonework marks the top of each wall and more of these giant bolt-throwers are mounted across the parapets. A massive magma fall descends from the rocky ceiling, right above the stronghold, onto the roof and is forked onto each side and then continues to flow down, buttressing each side of the stronghold almost as a defense mechanism, like they built it intentionally underneath this magma fall.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: Oh, that’s where the trapdoor is!
Sam: What? Trapdoor?
Travis: There’s a trapdoor.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Wait...under the magma?
Laura: You missed a lot, Scanlan.
Marisha: Oh, right.
Sam: I was with you the whole time.
Orion: Yes, but you were never paying attention.
Sam: I was drunk.
Orion: You got that new magazine and you’ve been staring at it a long time.
Sam: Well, it’s hot gnomes.
Liam: Vax creeps back to Pike and ushers her up to the front. Do you recall any of the details from your vision, from your dreams?
Ashley: I’ve definitely been here in my vision. (all laugh)
Ashley: I do remember that much. All of this looks familiar, and I think we’re in the right place.
Laura: Sweet.
Orion: Very good. That’s all important.
Ashley: Do we know what else is around? What was the building again? With the--
Sam: It’s a fortress.
Matt: The giant building you see is called Emberhold. That’s what it’s been referred to as.
Sam: And it’s not a temple?
Matt: It’s not a temple, it is a fortress. The temple of where apparently K'Varn as far as you know exists is further below in the fungal forest that surrounds this ancient city ruin that has been repurposed by the illithids that Clarota actually came from.
Laura: Oh, yes! And we know here, because the general that we mind melded - Clarota read his brain.
Sam: Yeah, I was there!
Laura: I know. It’s just you were drunk, so I’m reiterating it. (all laugh)
Sam: Yeah yeah, good, thank you for that.
Orion: Just making sure.
Taliesin: You had this very vivid look the whole time.
Laura: So remember, Scanlan, that the general said that on the left side of the fortress--
Sam: Of the fortress.
Laura: --is how we can get into the trapdoor.
Sam: How we can get into the trapdoor, exactly.
Liam: By the smaller--
Sam: Smaller--
Liam: --of two lava flows.
Laura: By the smaller of two lava flows.
Sam: --of two...what?
Laura: Lava flows.
Ashley: So what we’re looking at is the fortress?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You’re looking at Emberhold itself, the center of the duergar society and from what you’ve gleaned from two different duergar that you’ve interrogated, supposedly where Lady Kima has been held should she still--
Laura: by King Murghol?
Matt: --By King Murghol. Murghol and Queen Ulara.
Liam: From our vantage point can we see the two lava flows that we were warned about?
Matt: It is way too far away. That stronghold is probably a good mile and a half away from you right now.
Laura: So, there is a lot of cover as we go near it because of all the…?
Matt: There is a lot of cover, yes, but it’s a lot of open area with cover, so it’s one of those you’re just going to have to be careful as you move through.
Sam: Percy.
Laura: It’s pretty dark here, right?
Taliesin: Yes?
Sam: How long would it take you to make a nuclear weapon?
Matt: Yes, it’s pretty dark here, the only reason you can see much is because of the low light vision.
Taliesin: A very long time. If I start it right now..
Matt: Even at this radius, things you could see nearby, a light source would be very helpful in making sure that you can see details and not fall in anything you don’t want to, but it also makes you very visible to anything else out there, so you have to decide.
Liam: Between the lava and the red stones, the twins can see, correct? Because of the dim light.
Matt: You can see near, but these are things that are a mile away.
Laura: But nothing at a distance.
Liam: Right, right, right.
Matt: It’s way too far away. The reason you can make out this small city and Emberhold itself is because there are clusters of the red glowstone used within that city and the giant magma fall that currently envelops the sides of the stronghold, making it very, very visible and easy to pick out against the rest of the cavern.
Ashley: So this is a whole little city down here.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: About a mile off, yeah.
Laura: So we should keep to the left and head down that direction and try to--
Marisha: I'm actually gonna go ahead and cast Pass Without A Trace.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: (whispering) What does that do?
Marisha: (whispering) It makes us really stealthy.
Sam: Oh, cool!
Orion: It's the thing that saved our butts last time.
Liam: It quiets your parts.
Matt: You've seen this before. As she finishes her incantation, you feel the darkness of the shadows around you begin to coalesce and almost stick to you. Although there's no substance, for a moment you almost find yourself repulsed by it, until you realize that it's probably an advantageous circumstance. But you find yourself now much easier to slip into the surrounding shadows.
Marisha: They're nice shadows.
Travis: And I'm doing my flower girl routine with the dust of tracelessness. Just over here, over there, put a little on Pike.
Taliesin: We don't really need - Well...
Travis: What? We've got a really large amount.
Orion: You never know, Percy, he does it all the time. We don't know how many times it's saved us.
Marisha: (laughing) We've got a really large amount.
Taliesin: I suppose that's fair.
Sam: What's our angle here, gents?
Liam: We need to get closer up. We need to find this trap door, because it's suicide going in the front.
Laura: Right. And Lady Kima's being held here.
Sam: So there's an entrance to this trap door that possibly is on the outskirts of the city?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: So we need to find it.
Laura: Yes, it's on the left.
Sam: Oh, it's on the left?
Laura: Yes, so we're heading left and going--
Sam: Let's do it!
Liam: The twins will creep - continue ahead.
Ashley: Yeah, you guys real stealthy, so--
Travis: Yeah, keep creeping, keep creeping.
Ashley: --Probably smart that you're moving ahead.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: I'll take point on the group that's following.
Matt: All right.
Laura: You guys take care of Trinket as I'm ahead of you.
Ashley: Come on, Trinket.
Travis: (growling sounds) Me and Trinket are telling jokes in the back of the group.
Sam: Quietly.
Marisha: Classic Trinket.
Matt: All right. You guys continue staying off the main path and you can see there is about a 20-foot natural formation of a walkway or at least where most of the patrols and any sort of duergar foot travel is localized. You can see where that natural road has been created over time. You avoid that path and steer off to the left, dodging between the various bits of terrain. And it's a very rocky and difficult terrain should you not be with your ranger, who has the Underdark as her favored terrain.
Laura: Oh, I'll go back, then. Should I? Or is it okay because we're all together?
Matt: It's okay because you guys are in theory together. I'm going to say essentially you're just marking places where the terrain would be dangerous, to watch your step and to be wary of any locations that might be unsafe for load bearing, anything like that.
Travis: Yeah, I saw that look. You calling me load bearing? (all laugh)
Matt: Yes!
Travis: That's honest.
Matt: Specific. As you guys begin to curve around the left, everyone roll a perception check real fast.
Sam: Oh, snap.
Travis: Prepare for a natural... lap.
Orion: With our proficiency bonus?
Matt: Only if you're proficient with perception.
Sam: I can't read the dice. It's either a 6 or a 9. No idea.
Orion: 15.
Matt: Is there a dot on the bottom?
Sam: Oh, that's the bottom?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: It's a 6! (all laugh)
Ashley: Oh, Scanlan!
Marisha: 16.
Orion: 15.
Taliesin: 24.
Travis: 9.
Ashley: 19.
Laura: 20.
Liam: 25.
Matt: All right. Both Percy and Vax simultaneously put their arms out to hold everyone back as you instinctively--
Liam: Dtdtdt!
Matt: --You hear a slight distant clanking of metal and voices. Low, kind of conversational voices. Too far for you to listen at this point. But you guys immediately stop everyone. And you can just see, over maybe a good 70, 80 feet from your distance, heading up the path you guys had just began to skirt around, a small, what looks like a roving patrol of duergar. Probably the ones that go up and down the tunnel.
Laura: I can ambush them!
Sam: Ambush them?
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Taliesin: (whispering) Let them pass.
Sam: Why don't we create a distraction and get rid of them?
Laura: Well, okay, but I can - (whispering) I can be really quiet. I can do Hide In Plain Sight now. So, I could completely hide myself standing there.
Sam: How many are there? Are you gonna kill--
Matt: No one's seen them, you can just hear them. No one's gone to check.
Laura: Oh! Can I look?
Liam: Yes, let's go look.
Matt: You can.
Laura: Okay, let's look.
Liam: Let's go catch one.
Marisha: (quietly) Can we not just hide?
Matt: Just the two of you?
Orion: How far away are we from them? Like, in distance?
Matt: Right now? You're guessing about 80 to 70 feet, but closing fast. Not closing directly on you, because they're doing a slightly different path.
Laura: (whispering) Everybody stay quiet.
Taliesin: They're taking the path that we're not on, right?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: So, if we hide--
Laura: They won't find us.
Taliesin: --They won't find us.
Laura: Potentially.
Orion: And they can just pass.
Laura: But I want to hear what they're saying.
Matt: Okay, so all of you guys, who's--
Marisha: We'll all hide. I go ahead and cast Guidance on Vax.
Laura: What does that mean?
Liam: Vex.
Matt: Is that a concentration spell?
Laura: I'm Vex, he's Vax. We look alike, it's understandable.
Matt: Just checking if it’s concentration or not, because that will definitely break your other spell. I'll pull it up here real fast.
Laura: Oh, no, then don't. Keep Pass Without A Trace.
Travis: Well, we could just get this party started right here, if we want to.
Marisha: Let me see, it might just be--
Matt: Guidance is concentration.
Marisha: No, sorry, you don't have my guidance.
Laura: That's okay, that’s okay.
Marisha: No guidance here.
Liam: Why don't we go just up ahead and scout?
Laura: Just a little bit ahead and see what we can see.
Matt: Okay. So, the two of you kind of work up. As the rest of you are holding back, the twins slink between the various rock formations and strange, jagged spires that are currently peppering this entire underground landscape. You get up to a point where you're maybe 10 feet from the road and with your backs against the rock, you can begin to see the roving band slowly move around.
Sam: (whispering) Band?
Matt: The band of duergar. You count, at quick glance, roughly 12 to 15.
Marisha: Oh, yeah...
Matt: Armed with hammers, halberds, um... Both of you guys roll a perception check right now.
Liam: Perception check.
Matt: Perception check. Specific for this one.
Liam: 26.
Laura: 17.
Matt: You make out that one of them holds no weapons. Instead is dressed in--
Laura: Wait, no! I get advantage on perception, because I'm in my favored terrain.
Matt: There you go.
Liam: I already perceived it.
Laura: Oh, yeah, never mind, okay. (all laugh)
Matt: You can also perceive, I suppose.
Orion: (whispering) I already perceived it.
Matt: One of the duergar walking alongside is completely bald on top with this extremely long, well sculpted, black goatee beard that streams down. Thick black and red trimmed robes. Carries no weapons and looks extremely dangerous. However, as you're listening to the conversation, you specifically, being able to understand Undercommon--
Laura: Yes.
Liam: What is he saying?
Laura: Hold on.
Matt: --You pick up bits and pieces as they begin to pass by. You hold your breath, hoping nobody notices you, and so far so good. They begin to walk slowly past the rock you guys are against. You overhear one of them say: "Well, keep your eyes peeled, eh. That thing is still out there." And the other one slaps him and says: "Horek says that it ate a whole scouting party in seconds." Another one goes: "Listening to Horek was your first mistake. Shut up and keep walking." And they all keep pushing. At which point, the same scared one from before says: "I mean, if that one went crazy, well, can't the other ones crack, too? I don't know if I feel safe around any of K'varn's pets anymore at this rate." And by that point, they begin to slowly move past and their voices begin to fade, as they continue up the path you guys just traversed down.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Up to the lava tunnels.
Laura: Oh shit.
Travis: Good thing I was clearing our footprints. (all laugh)
Matt: It's actually a very good thing.
Sam: It's a win for Grog.
Travis: (high-pitched voice) Is it? Did I do something good?
Liam: Good job, dummy.
Marisha: (laughing) Did I do something good?
Matt: You guys have, like, bear tracks and a giant goliath, like, what-- (laughs)
Orion: These are amazing.
Marisha: What are they?
Laura: Fried banana.
Marisha: Oh! That's fun.
Matt: Fried bananas? Toss me one of those. Is that from the chat?
Sam: You're working. You don't have time to eat.
Zac: (off screen) Yes, the chat room.
Matt: Thank you, chatroom.
Laura: Thank you, chatroom.
Marisha: Thank you.
Orion: Thanks so much.
Matt: I know it's not a piece of pizza, guys, but I'll do what I can. (all laugh)
Sam: Next time, sushi. Sushi.
Zac: (off screen) Instajur and somebody who didn't put their name on it.
Matt: (disappointed) Oh.
Orion: Instajur and mystery guy, thanks!
Zac: Coleson sent the pizza.
All: Thank you!
Ashley: Oh my god, that's so good.
Matt: The sound of the duergar walking eventually fades and you feel pretty confident that you're safe to return to the rest of the party.
Laura: Okay. So, we walk back. So, apparently, number one, big party, we don't want to fight them if we don't have to. Secondly, there's some weirdo creature that's gotten loose and is very, very bad and it's killed multiple duergar already.
Liam: Quickly.
Laura: That might be the thing--
Sam: No indication of what kind of a creature it was?
Laura: No, but it might be the thing we already killed. It could've been the thing with the plate that showed up in the camp, I don't know.
Sam: The thing with the plate?
Ashley: The thing in the red rider wagon.
Travis: The bullet, the bullet.
Laura: The big thing.
Travis: Bulette.
Marisha: Bulé.
Sam: Oh!
Laura: It could've been that, I'm not sure.
Travis: It's a French dog.
Marisha: It’s French, yeah.
Laura: Regardless, we should be very careful, traveling forward.
Taliesin: I've seen your sheet, you don't speak French.
Sam: We could use that to our advantage.
Orion: We could! We could. We could scare them off quite easily.
Marisha: I had a grandmother who did, okay?
Laura: I like the way you think. All right.
Orion: I can make funny sounds.
Laura: Should we keep moving forward at a very stealthy sort of pace?
Orion: Waka waka.
Matt: Certainly.
Taliesin: The stealthy mix.
Matt: You guys push forward, keeping that wide, kind of left curve, which adds a fair amount of time to your travel, as you're being careful and moving at a very very heavy, circular arc around the duergar city.
Sam: I'm looking for doors and stuff as we go. I don't know why.
Matt: Sure! Looking for doors!
Sam: Well, there's a trap door somewhere, right?
Orion: (old man voice) There’s doors in them there caves.
Matt: Good thinking.
Liam: That'll be the fortress, maybe, but--
Laura: Possibly. Could be farther. Can we see the molten things that he was talking about? The lava flows?
Matt: Still too far away.
Laura: Still too far away.
Matt: As you begin to make your way around, you're just starting to get to the point where you can see the front of the fortress. And you can see where the magma fall splits and just coalesces around each side of the stronghold. Almost like a blanket waterfall on each side. It does split up at certain points, you can begin to start making it out.
Taliesin: Where does the magma runoff lead to? Does it just pour out? Does it fill a moat?
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance, unfortunately. You'd have to get closer up to see. About an hour of travel around the side--
Laura: Oh wow.
Liam: I’m so bored.
Laura: (laughs) Don't say that.
Matt: (laughs) That can be fixed, Liam. (all laugh)
Taliesin: If only there were a way to just speed up this exposition somehow.
Travis: Of all the things.
Matt: Indeed.
Taliesin: Life isn't like that.
Orion: Wow, Percy!
Taliesin: Sorry. (all laugh)
Laura: (whispering) Be quiet.
Matt: It's at this point, immediately catching your eye, Vex, one of the nearby obsidian spires is a different color than the rest. The rest are like a deep black, glass shiny color. This one is a dull crimson.
Laura: Ooh! We should go towards that one.
Sam: Because it's a different color?
Liam: Let's go check it out.
Marisha: Wait, what was the first color? I was still laughing at Percy. What?
Liam: Just eat your banana, the twins will go check it out.
Matt: Black obsidian, this was red--
Marisha: (laughing) Red, okay.
Matt: --crimson, ruddy, anyway.
Taliesin: Do you not know anything?
Liam: The twins are gonna go have a peek.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'm coming with.
Matt: Scanlan comes with. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Sam: Oh boy. (laughs)
Taliesin: I'm not coming with.
Sam: Not my strong suit.
Travis: Don't fuck it up.
Laura: No, Scanlan, what did you do?
Liam: You dick!
Travis: Did you?
Marisha: What did you do? (all laugh)
Orion: You can change your mind.
Ashley: Wait, wait, I go and--
Sam: I've got advantage, don't I?
Ashley: --I grab Scanlan and I kiss him on the cheek and make him stay. (all gasp and exclaim)
Orion: What?!
Taliesin: Way to take one for the team.
Orion: Oh no.
Travis: I don't know.
Liam: You just stopped him from farting into his flute.
Ashley: Persuasion? That would be...
Orion: Ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge moment.
Marisha: Can you roll a persuasion against a critical fail? Can you? Can you persuade a crit fail?
Laura: Can you persuade the DM?
Ashley: Wait, is it a fail?
Marisha: (laughing) Can you persuade the DM?
Ashley: It is a 1?
Matt: Okay, so it was a 1--
Sam: It was a 1.
Liam: That's a 1 face. (all laugh)
Liam: That's a 1 face.
Matt: I will say, Pike, roll a perception check.
Orion: d20!
Laura: Come on, come on, d20.
Ashley: Perception?
Liam: Yes, d20. Uh, that's a half a d20.
Ashley: 14?
Laura: (soft, high voice) No, no... yes, 14. (all laugh)
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: I'll stop.
Matt: Unfortunately, you're not quite perceptive enough to notice Scanlan's not quite so quiet walking away, as you're distracted by the surroundings and the circumstance locally. You continue up with the twins, absentmindedly humming to yourself.
Sam: (sings softly)
Matt: The twins, being used to your humming, for some reason it doesn't connect. You make your way up to the spire. At about 15, 20 feet out, you notice the coloration is different, because it is completely coated in what looks like dried blood of some kind.
Liam: Fuck.
Laura: (gasps) Oh god.
Matt: And immediately to the right of it, along the ground--
Orion: So grossed out.
Matt: --currently your vision is obscured by another, large kind of twisted stalactite, but there appears to be an arm and a whole bunch more dried blood across the ground, just out of view.
Laura: (gasps) Stop! Can we stop? Can we stop?
Matt: You can stop.
Marisha: An arm?
Laura: Scanlan. Shh.
Sam: What? What?
Laura: (whispering) You're singing.
Sam: I was singing? (whispering) I was singing? I didn't even know! It's a force of habit!
Liam: I'm going to see if I can see anything in the area that has done this recently.
Laura: Is the arm attached to whatever did--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: Investigation check?
Laura: --Is the arm part of a dead thing or is it alive?
Matt: It's on the ground.
Travis: I'm pretty sure whatever it is, it's dead.
Liam: 7.
Matt: 7?
Laura: Can I check it out as well? I mean, I'm there, I might as well.
Matt: You can also attempt to make an investigation check.
Liam: Clever. There you go.
Laura: Wait, I'm doing advantage, too, just in case. Okay, that one's better.
Liam: Oh, I can get advantage?
Sam: You get advantage on investigation?
Laura: No, I got it because I'm fucking in my favored terrain. (all laugh)
Laura: 21.
Marisha: You walk up in this terrain.
Matt: The state of the blood that you see around seems to indicate that this has transpired over some time. You're guessing probably within a few days, if not a week, since this happened.
Liam: I'm picking up one of the arms--
Laura: (Gasps)
Liam: --to bring back to the group.
Matt: Okay, so as you walk up towards the arm to grab it, you have more of a view of what's happened. And what you see before you are definitely remnants of some battle long past.
Laura: This is the skelly pile.
Matt: Against these rocky formations there's dried blood everywhere.
Liam: Not pretty.
Matt: This terrible bloodbath, whatever this event was, it was probably a horrible thing to see. There are pieces of duergar flung about. And I say pieces - the only reason you know duergar were there is because occasionally you see part of a head, or part of a foot. And you recognize the ashy skin from the areas that aren't currently caked with its own gore.
Liam: (gagging sounds)
Matt: From what you can tell, because of your investigation check, the remains are torn apart by no blade. There's no cuts, there's no clean wounds. They're either pulled apart by force--
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: --like, arms and limbs were wrenched from the body just out of sheer power.
Travis: Like a Wookiee.
Matt: Or there appears to be some sort of gnawing, some chewing, like toothy fangs, sharp teeth have partially eaten portions of these bodies.
Liam: This is the work of a beaver.
Laura: Yes, definitely, a very large beaver.
Orion: A busy beaver.
Sam: I think it's suicide. (all laugh)
Laura: Based on tracking and everything and insight, can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby? Or if it's gone?
Orion: I think it might be foul play, actually.
Matt: From what you can tell--
Liam: It happened in the past.
Matt: --Yeah, it happened quite some time ago. Looking at the tracks, you can see duergar feet, you can see other creatures that resemble those hook horrors that you encountered earlier during the lava pool. However, there's a series of tracks that you haven't seen. Well, there is very erratic footsteps that look human size, but they seem to be placed randomly, like one foot here, one foot here, one foot here.
Laura: (gasps) It's that big creature that - it was like one of those things that that thing put together, like--
Matt: And you see what seem like strange strikes through the sand, like someone had been dragged very quickly in a very localized spot, scattered all about.
Liam: It's a human centipede.
Sam: It is. It's a human centipede.
Matt: It's a very strange pattern that you can't really grasp what kind of creature would make it.
Laura: And it seems like it was here recently, or a while ago?
Matt: Best you can tell, the last time it was here was about two or three days ago, to feast on more of the remains.
Liam: Human? Human footprints?
Laura: Should we get out of here?
Matt: Human sized.
Liam: Human sized.
Travis: Or set a trap.
Laura: We could try to set a trap, or we could look and see if we can loot anything? Is there anything to loot? Does it look like anything shiny?
Matt: Any semblance of armor that belonged to any of these individuals is in such tatters that it's unusable. You do manage to find, across some of the body parts, a couple of blood-soaked gold coin purses.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Take it.
Laura: I like gold.
Matt: One of them contains a handful of gems.
Laura: Ooh!
Marisha: Gems.
Matt: Yes, those right there. So you can mark that down, until you get a chance to appraise them.
Liam: I don't think we want to tangle with this. What are we trying to prove? Let's just keep trucking.
Sam: I'm really bad at stealthing, we should go. (all laugh)
Sam: We should leave.
Liam: Also, put the accordion back in the bag, all right?
Sam: Was I doing that? It's force of habit, I don't - it's like breathing.
Liam: Yeah, we're going to go back to the group, I'm going to bring the arm.
Travis: I take out the cask of ale and pour a little tankard of ale, just because I'm bored.
Ashley: Have a sip sip.
Matt: Good man. Well done. It's very tasty.
Travis: Would anyone else like a sip? Keyleth?
Matt: Having been underground for what probably amounts now to four or five days, that little taste of ale on your lips is a very welcoming and very refreshing sensation.
Travis: It's good shit, right?
Ashley: Oh, delicious. Oh no, I'm drunk! Just kidding. (all laugh)
Ashley: That was fast! Just kidding.
Liam: When we get back to the group, I'm going to toss the arm to Grog.
Matt: Grog, you instinctively reach up and catch it. You look down and see what looks like a duergar arm that has been very heavily mangled.
Travis: Oh! Thanks for the hand! (all laugh)
Liam: It's a back scratcher.
Orion: That was clever, Grog!
Laura: Well, we killed a lot of duergar this time.
Travis: Don't negative anything. It was a good joke. (all laugh)
Matt: It was a good joke. I considered it, but no.
Travis: Have mercy!
Orion: That was a good joke.
Laura: There's a big centipede-y human, creepy creature that's killed a lot of things and we should probably avoid that at all costs.
Orion: I would agree with that.
Liam: If we have to, we will, but--
Taliesin: That seems fair.
Laura: Can we avoid that and still head left of the keep?
Matt: You haven't seen a creature.
Sam: Wait, we didn't make it into the - was there a structure that we could have entered?
Laura: That's where we're going.
Liam: You're heading towards that structure.
Matt: You're heading towards that structure.
Sam: Okay. But I mean, where we just were?
Orion: The magma fortress.
Matt: Where you just were? No, there's just all these giant rocky spires jutting out of the ground.
Liam: Spike coated in dried blood.
Sam: They didn't have doors in them?
Laura: Should we probably have looked for like a nest?
Matt: There were no doors.
Sam: Okay, good. I'm looking for a door!
Liam: No, we should just keep going. If we're going to run into it, we're going to run into it. Let's not find it.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: It appears like there was, at one point in time, some very intense seismic activity in this area that created this cavern, and whatever is the source of a lot of this perpetually flowing, molten rock. That's why the entire terrain here is so dangerous and uninviting, is because of the sheer force that went into its creation.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: So we should just keep freaking being careful and keep going towards the giant thing.
Sam: Okay. Let's go.
Ashley: Keep trucking on.
Sam: Pike, I have this weird feeling, like you wanted to make out with me. Is that something that happened? Am I dreaming?
Ashley: Well, you just, you know, you weren't paying attention.
Sam: Really?
Laura: And that makes you want to make out with him?
Ashley: No, I think you were moving along to try to go stealth and sometimes you should just stay put and see what happens. (all laugh)
Orion: Well said, cleric!
Liam: That was the most adorable diss in history. (all laugh)
Taliesin: That was cold.
Sam: All right.
Orion: Yet inviting.
Travis: It's all right, Scanlan. We'll go pay for it later. (all laugh)
Matt: A small hit to Scanlan's morale, but the party marches on.
Liam: You lose an inspiration die. (all laugh)
Travis: Disadvantage on whatever roll.
Sam: I deserved it, I deserved it.
Liam: Okay, twins in front, here we go.
Laura: Let's keep going.
Matt: Twins in front. You guys continue to push forward. For the sake of the length of this journey, I'm going to have the party go ahead and roll a communal stealth check once more.
Marisha: I still have Pass Without A Trace up.
Taliesin: Oh, for the love of god.
Marisha: Which gives everyone a plus 10.
Laura: Oh, really?!
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Percy! Don't bang the guns together.
Taliesin: Yeah, that happened too.
Orion: 24.
Matt: 24?
Sam: 19.
Liam: We all have plus 10?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: And this is plus 10, already?
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: I rolled a 1.
Matt: Okay. (all groan)
Laura: Oh, Percy!
Sam: I kiss Percy! (all laugh)
Taliesin: What?! Ah!
Sam: I don’t know! I thought it might help.
Orion: You have to use the tongue, Scanlan.
Marisha: 23.
Sam: Is that bubblegum?
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Travis: 26.
Ashley: 3.
Taliesin: I have a habit.
Laura: (gasps) You have a plus 10.
Ashley: Oh! I get to do plus 10 bonus to that?
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: 13!
Matt: All right, so that's three failures.
Laura: 30.
Marisha: Three failures?
Liam: 32.
Matt: Okay, good.
Taliesin: (relieved) Ah!
Matt: More than half you guys succeeded. That bit is key. A one is two failures.
Laura: Oh no!
Ashley: I'm not stealthy, man.
Marisha: A one is two failures?
Matt: A one is considered two failures for this challenge. Pushing forward--
Taliesin: Now you roll well.
Matt: --you manage to stop Percy and find out the root of this audio problem. Pushing forward, you manage to make your way about a quarter mile on the outskirts of this cluster of buildings. Curving far left, you're just managing to keep out of the city proper and move straight towards the very back wall of this cavern, which is buttressed against - what this fortress is built against. So you're circumventing the city to go straight to this fortress. As you're moving, about a quarter mile from the stronghold, Vex, you pick up a strange person standing maybe about 50, 60 feet ahead of you.
Laura: Just a person?
Matt: Just a person, it looks like.
Laura: (worried laughter)
Orion: (worried laughter)
Laura: Can they see us? Does it look like they can see us?
Matt: You take a moment, keeping an eye out, and the person isn't moving. Just standing right there.
Laura: (whispering) So. There's a person standing right there.
Marisha: (whispering) What?
Laura: (whispering) A person. He's just standing there.
Matt: It's too dark to make out any details, unfortunately.
Laura: No. Hmm.
Sam: Could be good, could be bad. We have no idea.
Liam: Can I see him now that she's pointed him out to me?
Sam: I can hold him. Might piss him off.
Travis: At least do the hold.
Matt: You can see it. And there is a humanoid, standing on its own.
Liam: It doesn't seem to be moving, though.
Laura: Maybe it's a scarecrow?
Liam: Maybe it's a statue.
Laura: Yeah, that's what I mean.
Travis: A statue?
Sam: Want me to go check it out?
Liam: No! I don’t!
Laura: Can't you go invisible?
Sam: Yes, I can go invisible.
Laura: Go invisible and check it out.
Sam: I polymorph and turn into a fly and I buzz over.
Marisha: Oh, yay! That's fun.
Liam: Good job, gnome nuts.
Laura: Oh no, if he's magic, he's going to know.
Sam: It's all right. I've got magic, too.
Matt: You approach this individual and notice it is unmoving and is of a singular, solid color.
Laura: (whispering) It's a statue.
Matt: What looks to be what is an illithid or a mind flayer is currently locked in some sort of reactionary position, but is completely turned to stone.
Laura: Oh no!
Marisha: Oh shit.
Sam: Like a Medusa type of a thing?
Liam: We faced basilisks once and they did this to Vex'ahlia.
Travis: We've got basilisk eggs.
Marisha: There's a lot of things that can do this, actually, to be fair.
Laura: We do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding.
Travis: Yeah, we’ve got eight of them. Maybe we should crack one on statue guy.
Sam: I buzz back to the group. (buzzing)
Laura: Oh, what's that? Oh, it's Scanlan.
Sam: I kind of fuck with Tiberius's ear a little bit. (all laugh)
Orion: Oh, Scanlan, stop it!
Sam: And I turn back. (all laugh)
Travis: Well, what did you see?
Laura: What was it?
Sam: A crazy statue of a crazy illithid.
Liam: That's crazy.
Laura: Can we look at Clarota and say "Do you know anything about this?"
Matt: Clarota kind of thinks for a second and goes (breathy, raspy voice) "As far as I've noticed, occasionally these patrols do walk with a lizard creature that has this ability. It's generally used as a threatening device or a guardian amongst the city."
Marisha: Oh! So the duergar--
Laura: Have basilisks.
Marisha: --have this as, like, their pets?
Matt: "A trained beast, yes."
Liam: Why do you suppose they used it on one of their own?
Matt: "I can only imagine maybe this transpired before the union and is left as a warning."
Liam: So it's a duergar pet?
Laura: Do we remember how to take care of basilisks? Like, do we not look at them, is that how they don't--
Liam: Don't look at them. That's correct.
Laura: Don't look them in the eye? Or don't look at their face?
Liam: Yes, that's it. It's a vision thing.
Laura: Yes?
Taliesin: Yes, I believe it's vision based.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: This would be a nature check.
Taliesin: Double check.
Matt: For anyone who wishes to make one.
Marisha: I'll do that.
Travis: Me too. (all laugh)
Taliesin: 23. Natural 20.
Laura: Oh, well, never mind. He's got it.
Orion: Very good, yay!
Marisha: Oh, well, I'll stop there.
Travis: Just go ahead and dunk on everybody, why don't you?
Matt: Natural 20. Essentially it is a sight-based circumstance.
Taliesin: It's entirely visual. They have to catch your gaze and then that is how they can turn you into stone. Otherwise, as long as you don't catch their gaze, you'll be fine.
Laura: All right.
Liam: All right. It's a good thing we've all been watching Daredevil last week.
Travis: So, look them in the eye? Got it. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Yes! Very helpful.
Travis: Let's go.
Marisha: Poor basilisks. Can never make eye contact.
Sam: We're going on?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Yeah, let's keep going.
Matt: As you guys push forward, Clarota lags behind a little bit to inspect the statue. Kind of looks it over for a second--
Laura: Did you know him?
Matt: (low, breathy voice) "Uh…"
Sam: Dave.
Matt: (laughing) Goddamn it! (all laugh)
Orion: I don't think his name was Dave, Scanlan.
Matt: He takes a moment to look over and you can see his eyes close slightly for a second. (raspy, breathy voice) "Aye, we've met. Not the kindest of my people, but, nevertheless, should all this pass, I would like to, maybe, release him from this stony prison."
Laura: So you know how to do that?
Matt: "I know not, but it can be done. I've seen it."
Laura: Didn't we do that?
Orion: Yes.
Laura: Didn't we have to do that?
Liam: We sprinkled some of its blood on your eyes, if I remember correctly.
Orion: Yes!
Laura: I turned to stone?
Matt: You did.
Liam: You did. I was very sad.
Orion: Yes, that's correct. We used the blood of the creature.
Laura: I remember, I remember. Yeah, I remember that.
Matt: Essentially, there is a liquid that can be distilled from the basilisk blood.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: We don't have any more of that.
Matt: You do not.
Laura: Okay. So we'll be careful.
Travis: Dragon blood for fucking days.
Liam: We also don't know if it's a basilisk.
Sam: Should we move this statue off to a safe place, inside or anything?
Laura: Nah, fuck it.
Sam: It's fine here, it's fine.
Liam: No, it's heavy.
Laura: Let's just keep going.
Marisha: It's been there for a while.
Taliesin: Let's not give anybody any indication we've been here.
Laura: It's got bat poo on it, let's keep going.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: As you guys press forward, about another 20 or so minutes, you now have a much better view of the left side of Emberhold proper. And you can see the large magma fall that is pouring over the top of the fortress's second story and completely encompasses that side. It splits and divides towards the center - a larger fall towards the front of the fortress and a thinner one towards the very back.
Laura: (whispering) Thin one! Thin one!
Travis: Yeah, let's go towards the door.
Liam: All right, creeping back.
Laura: Yeah! Creepy, creepy, creepy towards the thin one.
Liam: The creeps are creeping.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: We're in stealth, still, or...?
Travis: Yeah, we're all stealthed.
Matt: For you, it'd be stealth. Yeah, you guys are all stealthed still.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: We're rolling again?
Liam: 26.
Laura: You don't to need check it again, he didn't tell us to.
Liam: Oh. Well, I said I wanted to go back and look.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: So you move ahead of the rest of the group and head to the front of this stream. And you can see the smooth wall with molten rock pouring down the side, and you can see where portions of the stone have been gradually worn and melted by just the contact, but then built upon by more and more cooled rock. This is a very weird clustered framing of cooled rock around this fall. You see no doorway, as the actual magma is pressing directly against the side of the stronghold.
Liam: Right, I want to see if I can tell if anything - I know this all looks natural, but perhaps something is fashioned to look such. I want to see if I can figure that out.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigate check.
Liam: Uh, lalalala. 18.
Matt: 18? Best that you can find, looking around, you cannot see anything before you, any sort of mechanism, any sort of any button, any sort of lever, or additional doorway. It's just a solid wall, with the two magma flows.
Liam: All right. I double back for the Underdark expert and I bring my sister up.
Laura: Right, right, right. Can I come up and look and see if I can see any tracking? If there's any footprints around a certain area around this.
Liam: See if you can find a false door or something.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make an investigate check.
Liam: Do it. Do it.
Marisha: Wait, I thought it was behind--
Liam: No!
Laura: It's okay, no, no, no! I get an advantage.
Liam: It was a 1.
Laura: Shush.
Liam: All right. That's not a 1.
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: Is it investigation?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: 22.
Matt: Okay. Looking at this, the side of this fortress, you can see what amounts to a very, very slight raise in the smooth flow of magma. It seems to pour down most of the stronghold and then slightly bulge out, and then it pools, and you can now have a better, closer so you see where it runs off to. It continues into a stream following the edge of the giant cavern wall that's curving down and to the left into a far deeper cavern. You can see the entire cavern, almost like a giant U. It's open, and the entire thing banks around it and goes deeper still. You guys have made it to the far back wall.
Laura: (gasps, sighs)
Matt: Ah, the chicken has arrived.
Sam: (laughs) Metaphorically...
Matt: Metaphorically, and actually. But from what you can see there is a slight raise beneath the magma.
Laura: Okay. Does it look like it's safe to bring everybody up here or does it seem like anything's around that could see us? Anything looking from above?
Matt: You glance up and you can see there are two duergar perched up on the edge of the first floor, right on the parapet. You can see there's all this jagged, obsidian stone, almost teeth, sticking out of the very top edge of the wall. And you see the patrols just walking, keeping an eye out. They have crossbows on their arms. A couple of others just have javelins at the side. And they're just doing slow patrols.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: We need to 007--
Laura: We're going to have to be super--
Sam: We're going to have to 007 sniper them out.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I can handle this, I think.
Laura: You can?
Marisha: I think I can get us into that trap door.
Sam: I think you're right.
Laura: Do you have something that can pull it towards you?
Sam: No no no, can you redirect the magma flow around that bulge with your - can't you, move rocks or--
Marisha: I can.
Sam: So you can create a like a little lip for it to go around?
Laura: Ooh...
Marisha: I was thinking I could either do - that's not a bad idea, or I could - That's actually not a bad idea. (all laugh)
Matt: (singing) That's fucking teamwork. (all laugh)
Marisha: Or I could, or I was thinking I could cool off the magma and we could break it.
Laura: Oh yeah, maybe you can move it away, and then cool it.
Liam: That sounds kind of noisy.
Marisha: Well...
Sam: First we’ve got to take care of the guys on the roof. Are they back with us, or are they still stealthing in front?
Matt: They're still stealthing in front, and you guys have come back to the group?
Laura: Yeah, I guess we came back to the group and told them about what's going on.
Sam: Okay. We can - me and Pike - can take out the guys on the roof.
Laura: Oh really?
Travis: Yeah! Do it!
Ashley: You want to give it a go?
Laura: Wait, but he's got sneak attack.
Liam: Yeah, I'm thinking that Keyleth should--
Laura: Yeah but we could--
Sam: Yeah, but they're a good 200 feet up.
Liam: --bird out and drop me.
Laura: If Keyleth can bird up or you could go over on the flying carpet or something.
Sam: I can take Pike and we can do it.
Laura: Oh my god. (all laugh)
Marisha: Are they are they unable to be shot out? Can you not arrow them out?
Laura: I can try to arrow them out too.
Marisha: How high are they?
Liam: She can get a hit or two, but the chances that she could take them both out at once...
Laura: Maybe you should go up and I'll arrow one and you...
Travis: Why don't you let the little people have some fun?
Marisha: I'm just afraid if you go up there, that you're going to alarm yourself to other people.
Taliesin: How loud is it down there? Is the lava flow making noise?
Matt: Very subtle pops and hisses, but other than that it's pretty quiet.
Taliesin: Not like the roaring sound of a waterfall.
Matt: No, no, it's a slow gradual pour.
Taliesin: Does anybody have a "mute" spell of some kind?
Sam: Mute, as in silence noise, or a person?
Laura: I mean, Pass Without Trace, there's silence?
Taliesin: Yes, as in silence noise.
Ashley: Wait!
Sam: No, not me.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Ashley: I have - okay wait.
Matt: David Norris? Thank you David Norris for the chicken!
All: Thank you David Norris!
Laura: The chicken is delicious!
Orion: I love chicken.
Liam: Dave, the illithids have it. Thank you, Dave.
Laura: I'm just not going to let you see me eat it.
Liam: Oh my god, her mouth opens up and tentacles come out and -
Orion: It's really scary.
Marisha: Sorry, what are we doing?
Matt: It's a good question. What are you doing?
Sam: We gotta take out the fuckers on the roof.
Laura: Right.
Sam: Do you want to try to shoot them out? Or do you want me to take Pike and fuck their shit up?
Travis: Do that.
Laura: I mean, if you can flip them off the roof that would be awesome.
Sam: That's what we're going to do.
Laura: Okay, then do it.
Liam: Wait, can we see anyone else?
Ashley: We're just going to fling them off of the roof?
Liam: Can I see duergar from any other perch?
Travis: Yep, pressure's on!
Matt: From your current position, you're up against the wall, no.
Liam: No? All right.
Matt: You can back away and take up more of a case on it if you want.
Marisha: I mean if I took eagle form I could drop you and then I could just pick one up with my eagle talons and in the lava they go.
Liam: This seems dangerous and reckless.
Marisha: It does seem very dangerous and reckless.
Liam: Let's do it?
Ashley: What if it brings attention?
Liam: Who gives a shit?
Marisha: I'm keeping my Pass Without A Trace up.
Laura: We'll just have to be fast. Be really speedy.
Orion: Can they see down to where we are? Does it just keep going?
Marisha: I'm going with you guys.
Travis: It's been over an hour, we've killed nothing, we'll kill these fucks!
Matt: So far only the two of them have really approached the stronghold and you guys have stayed back behind the elevations.
Travis: I'm a vampire. I need blood.
Matt: So you can all try, in theory, if you want to just stealth past them.
Marisha: Wait, what?
Sam: Here's my plan.
Laura: Okay!
Orion: We're not with them.
Marisha: Yeah we are, we are.
Sam: I take Pike up there. We knock those fuckers off, super easy.
Travis: Yep.
Sam: Grog runs out and brains them the second they hit the ground.
Travis: I approve of this plan.
Liam: Or fall in the lava. You just gotta shove them.
Laura: Yeah, they'll fall in the lava pit, just shove them off the side.
Sam: Maybe. I don't know where they're going to fall.
Laura: Well, just do it.
Marisha: Well, if they miss they miss the lava pit, we've got Grog.
Orion: Can I just say right now--
Laura: Just be ready to let us know if you need help.
Orion: --I'm going to be reading this book.
Marisha: Eagle form.
Liam: I'm hanging by Keyleth in case shit goes south.
Laura: Oh my god this is so stupid.
Liam: Then we're going up, right?
Marisha: Jump on my back.
Sam: What you got, Pike?
Liam: Yeah, girl.
Laura: Give me the flying carpet just in case I need to fly.
Marisha: Or I can give you a ride.
Sam: I can get you up there. What can you do when we're up there?
Ashley: There's something I've been wanting to do.
Sam: Yeah!
Travis: What do you say?
Orion: Oh my word, this is fascinating!
Laura: We're doing it!
Travis: But what do you say to get the magic carpet?
Laura: Please can I have the magic carpet?
Sam: I'm going to just look at the guard's pattern of movement. Are they staying in position, or are they walking around? Are they talking to each other at all?
Travis: Ooh, good question.
Matt: As you watch, you take a moment, still from the far back position, watch the two up there come together; they chat for a second, then a third one appears.
Sam: Oh shit.
Matt: Then one of them rotates out for the one that just arrived.
Ashley: They were switching shifts.
Matt: They both just sit there, keeping an eye. One of them cleans his bow.
Sam: Are they close to each other?
Matt: They're about twenty feet from each other along the top of the parapet.
Travis: There's three? There's three, not two?
Sam: You said twenty feet?
Matt: Twenty feet, yes.
Travis: There's three up there?
Taliesin: Now there's three.
Matt: Two.
Sam: No no, one came to swap out the other.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Travis: I’m just saying, I have been known to climb a few things in my time, if you need an extra.
Ashley: All right, let's do it.
Marisha: Are you coming too, Pike?
Ashley: Yeah! I'm a-coming up there to kill some - some things. (all laugh)
Travis: Do you have any climbing gear or anything?
Ashley: I have a grappling hook.
Liam: The ocean has changed you.
Laura: Oh my god. This is stupid.
Sam: Okay, they're standing twenty feet apart?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going to watch this all go down with Bad News.
Sam: Radius? 15 feet?
Laura: Yeah, me and you get ready to shoot.
Taliesin: I'm waiting in case--
Sam: Is the range a radius?
Marisha: So wait, who's all going?
Travis: Just those two.
Matt: No, range is how far away from you they are, and the radius is for the point of the spell.
Sam: No, I mean a range of a spell, is how far from me?
Marisha: Just those two?
Travis: Scanlan and Pike.
Laura: And you're going to bring them up if you can.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Got it. We're good.
Liam: Are they carpeting up? How are you going up?
Marisha: Are you guys going to fly on me?
Laura: They'll fly on Keyleth.
Liam: Scanlan, how are you guys going up? Eagle? Carpet?
Sam: No.
Laura: Eagle.
Liam: What?
Travis: You're climbing that shit, aren't you?
Sam: I can get there like that. We're good.
Travis: Cliffhanger. Beautiful.
Liam: Do it, Tom Cruise.
Laura: All right, do it. Mission Impossible.
Sam: All right. You ready? Do you know what you're going to do up there?
Ashley: Not really, but let's just wing it!
Sam: I'm going to try to knock them both off in one blow, but if I miss, you gotta take one.
Laura: You can charge them off if you want.
Ashley: Okay. all right. I can take one if you can take one.
Travis: You’ve got a morningstar.
Sam: Okay.
Ashley: All right.
Travis: Morningstar to the taint.
Sam: Grog, you ready to kill?
Travis: Yeah, oh yeah!
Laura: Be really quiet while you're fighting, try to take them out before they--
Taliesin: This is awesome and nothing is going to go wrong.
Marisha: Why are we using the gnomes to throw people over?
Orion: I can't believe how they wrote this.
Sam: We’re little people! You know why? Because I need someone with me and I can only take her, because that's the only other one who will fit through the Dimension Door with me.
Laura: Go!
Ashley: The Dimension Door?
Sam: Yes, we're going to go through a Dimension Door. I can take one person of my height or smaller.
Matt: All right.
Sam: So I will take Pike.
Liam: Portal, motherfucker!
Matt: You reach over and hold on to Pike gently, give her a little wink. And suddenly--
Sam: We're going to try to appear between the two of them. Exactly between the two of them.
Matt: Okay. You feel the sudden rush of air and the surrounding atmosphere of you goes from that uncomfortable warmth to a sudden freezing cold as your vision goes black and all you can see is Scanlan looking at you with this heightened grin as he's muttering these arcane incantations under his breath. An instant later, you guys are both standing at the top of the wall, with both of the duergar, one kind of facing away, one looking really surprised at the fact that you guys both appeared there. You have a surprise round. What are you doing?
Sam: I cast Thunderwave and blast out from where I'm standing between them, 15 feet in either direction.
Laura: (whispering) That's so loud!
Marisha: Isn't that loud?
Sam: So, 10 feet and 10 feet away from me.
Matt: Okay. What's your save?
Sam: Uh, 19.
Liam: But a quiet Thunderwave, right?
Matt: 19, all right.
Laura: A really quiet Thunderwave.
Orion: Thunderclap is loud. Thunderwave is different.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: But I'm pretty sure it's still thunder.
Matt: Thunderwave, looking it up real fast just to make sure of the situation.
Travis: I like this plan.
Orion: Thunder makes a noise right?
Liam: (singing) This is a triumph.
Ashley: (singing) I'm making a note here.
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: (singing) Huge success. (all laugh)
Matt: Here we go.
Sam: I don't think it's loud.
Liam: We're total fake geeks, all of us. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Such fake geeks.
Sam: Oh no - well, it's a wave of thunderous force, but it doesn't say sound. It just says thunderous force.
Matt: I would say thunderous force isn't a thunderclap,but it will make some noise.
Sam: Okay, fine.
Matt: So keep that in mind.
Laura: Keyleth, fly up and cast Pass Without Trace on them.
Matt: So, as you guys appear, you release Pike, you bring your arms up and slam your arms in a downward motion. As you do, there is a dull flash of light and a (boom noise) burst sound emanates from you.
Orion: I say, "Ooh, light."
Matt: Both of the duergar, the one who sees you, who is bringing us his crossbow to fire, gets impacted and blown off the side of the wall. The one facing away gets blown up towards, slams into the side of the wall, right at the edge, and then topples over the side, both plummeting over.
Liam: Wilhelm scream!
Ashley: Oh!
Matt: Brief Wilhelm scream. You're standing there, you watch this happen.
Ashley: I didn't have to do anything, Scanlan!
Sam: Make out with me! (all laugh)
Sam: We’re alone, it’s super romantic. I just killed two fuckers! Come on! It’s now or never, baby!
Travis: (singing) I think we’re alone now!
Ashley: (singing) Doesn’t seem to be anyone around! (all laugh)
Travis: (singing) Doesn’t seem to be anyone around! (all laugh)
Ashley: Well, let’s just wait until we’re out of danger.
Marisha: Yeah, it’s getting real romantic real quick, Scanlan.
Sam: Wait?
Ashley: But that was really hot!
Sam: It was really hot, right? Come on!
Ashley: It was.
Sam: Just a little something something?
Ashley: Let’s just--
Marisha: So sexy.
Matt: As this is happening, both of the duergar come plummeting off the side of the wall.
Liam: Friendzoned.
Matt: One manages to kind of loosely break his fall but the full 25 foot fall - he takes--
Laura: Get ready.
Liam: Come on, Grog.
Travis: I rage! (all laugh)
Matt: There’s one that lands just to the side of the magma pool that’s forming. He took some damage and is like (pained gasps) trying to get back up. He fell hard on one arm. The other one that’s further away from the magma, the one that saw you, managed to reduce his damage a little bit because it was aware at least you were there.
Sam: We have to kill these fuckers.
Matt: Looks like it took some damage, but not too much. It’s maybe 10 feet from you.
Travis: (eager laugh)
Matt: As he’s trying to get back up, he looks up and sees you charging towards him, Grog, raging. Go ahead and make your two attacks.
Laura: Yes!
Travis: (roars) 19.
Matt: 19 hits.
Travis: Nice. And 19 again!
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: I’m going to get some duergar!
Travis: 17 and 19.
Matt: So as he gets up, (grunt) he goes back for his warhammer. Before he gets a chance to, you cleave off one arm and send the axe right into the center of his torso, silencing him in an instant. He slightly spreads at the wound. (choking sound) This gurgling sound, and you just have to kick him off the edge of your axe.
Travis: I tilt him towards the pillar to spray the pillar with his gore. Look, I can make one too! Ha ha! (all laugh)
Marisha: I run across to the other one and Thorn Whip him from across the lava pool.
Matt: You have to jump over the lava to do that because he’s on the side you guys are on.
Marisha: Oh. Well then, is there anyone on the other side?
Ashley: Is he already dying, or no? He’s in the lava?
Marisha: He’s on the same side as me?
Matt: He’s on the same side as you.
Sam: He’s hurt.
Laura: We run up and kick him into the lava!
Marisha: Is he standing up or...yeah!
Matt: He’s in the process of standing up, yeah.
Laura: Can we just run up and kick him into the lava?
Marisha: Yeah, can I just run and push?
Matt: (laughs) Okay, all right, so…
Liam: I use pushing attack!
Travis: (grunts) Hunh!
Marisha: (grunts) Hunh!
Sam: (high voice) I’m sorry!
Marisha: (laughing) Yes, exactly! (all laugh)
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll athletics.
Marisha: This is the meanest thing I’ve ever done!
Liam: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Laura: No, no, remember you killed that kid one time.
Marisha: Oh, thanks for bringing that up, Vax! (all laugh)
Laura: I’m Vex, he’s Vax!
Travis: That’s some dark shit! That’s some dark shit!
Marisha: Oh, I thought it was Vex and Vax. Every time I get confused.
Matt: (laughing) It’s a long story!
Ashley: Oh my god. Remember you killed that kid one time?
Liam: Two and a half years in and Keyleth has just learned our names.
Marisha: I get them confused.
Sam: I do too. All the time.
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: All the time.
Marisha: See, no one else has any idea!
Orion: I have your names written down!
Liam: I’m Vex, okay? It’s simple!
Sam: No, no! That is not true!
Laura: No, no, don’t do that. He’s lying.
Marisha: (laughing) Two years, and I just don’t.
Matt: So, as the terrible blood spray occurs across the nearby pillar on Grog’s side, the other duergar is getting up with his crossbow, trying to get it ready. You rush forward. Go ahead and roll athletics.
Marisha: Oh!
Ashley: Come on!
Laura: Oh no!
Orion: As she does this, I notice everything, and I sit down.
Marisha: This is for that kid!
Orion: And turn to the next chapter in my book.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (singing) He had it coming, he had it coming.
Ashley: This is quite a good read!
Marisha: It could be worse. 14.
Matt: That’s okay. He rolled a 1.
Laura: Ooh! Yes!
Matt: So, as the duergar is getting up, he goes - (grunt) You just run up and - boom! And he falls back - (hissing SFX) (screams) - and starts giving a horrible, painful scream as he’s essentially flailing in the magma, melting.
Ashley: Someone shoot him in the mouth.
Marisha: I say, shh! Shh! Shh! And I wind down to push him under the lava!
Ashley: Oh, this is brutal!
Orion: That’s not what it’s called.
Matt: Okay. So, as he’s screaming your Wind Wall shoves him further under the magma as he’s screaming, cooling the magma around him as the rock (cracking SFX) cracks around him, turning into black rock--
Marisha: I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
Matt: --his face still visible over the surface, going (choking SFX) in this horrible, almost Han-in-carbonite type of look at the top of the magma pool.
Laura: Keyleth!
Liam: You just one-upped Grog, man.
Travis: That was awesome!
Matt: As fresh magma now begins to pool over the cool, covering his face, you step away.
Sam: Piss on the body!
Travis: I never knew you were an artist.
Marisha: (laughs nervously)
Matt: However, the subtle sound of the Thunderwave and then the horrible screams of pain, you can hear footsteps coming toward the wall edge where both you and Pike are currently on. What are you going to do?
Laura: Run! Or can you turn yourselves into duergar?
Sam: Is there a door or something?
Matt: Not from your current position, no. You’re just on a five foot ledge of the second story.
Sam: Of the fortress. Oh, it’s not a standalone tower. It’s part of a larger wall.
Ashley: How far of a jump down is it?
Matt: It’s about 25 feet.
Laura: What, am I too excited about it? Turn yourself into a duergar! Make it seem like everything’s okay!
Ashley: Should we call Grog?
Sam: No, I’ll do the same thing to get us down.
Ashley: Oh yeah, Dimension Door!
Sam: Unless you want to stay and fight.
Matt: You’ve got 20 seconds.
Marisha: Wait, what’s happening?
Ashley: We could try to stay and fight?
Liam: Turn into a duergar! (cawing sounds)
Laura: Turn into a duergar! Act like you’re a duergar! Say everything’s okay!
Ashley: Turn into a duergar?
Sam: Should we get out of here?
Ashley: Yeah, let’s get out.
Sam: Okay, we’re going to Dimension Door out.
Matt: Okay. So you grab her, (magic SFX) back down to the bottom.
Travis: Cast that shit.
Matt: They reappear at the bottom.
Orion: Are you done?
Marisha: Okay, I cast Wall of Stone, but right over top of where I see that lip. But I don't want to bring it out far. Just like, halfsies.
Sam: (laughs) Just the tip.
Marisha: Just the tip.
Ashley: Does it stop the magma?
Matt: As you guys appear at the bottom--
Marisha: So it goes like magma flow, here's the wall, I want it to go - (grinding noise)
Matt: --you guys hear footprints along the wall. They don't seem to have seen you yet. At which point there's this (grinding and thump sounds) sound of shifting rock. A giant stone wall juts out the side of the fortress right where the lava pool was pouring over the side. As it does, the lava pools on top of the wall and is offset, leaving a small gap where you guys can try to squeeze through. You can see, right underneath where it was, there is a stone doorway. It does not appear to have a handle or anything, it's just a stone door.
Sam: How do we get in?
Liam: Tiberius, fly up there quick.
Orion: What?
Liam: Stop eating chicken and fly up to that door.
Orion: Oh.
Ashley: Where did you get that chicken?
Orion: What's going on?
Liam: There's a magic doorway up there, I don't see any handles or anything.
Matt: It's right underneath the lava.
Liam: Oh, it’s on the ground?
Matt: Basically she put the stone wall out. It pours off.
Orion: It's right there! What are you talking about?
Liam: I walk up to it and take a look.
Laura: Oh yeah, that was good. Maybe Grog can push it!
Orion: I'm going to do an Arcana check.
Liam: Do I have advantage?
Matt: Uh, no.
Laura: Can Grog push it?
Liam: All right, take a look, dude.
Travis: No, he's doing an arcana check.
Sam: Grog, just kill it!
Marisha: (laughing) Go kill it, just punch the door!
Orion: 22.
Matt: 22? As you guys are inspecting this, in the time you've taken to do this, both the duergar up on top have seen you, and are both taking shots at you.
Sam: Oh shit.
Taliesin: I was waiting for that anyways so, I'm going to--
Marisha: He was waiting.
Matt: As they appear on the top, you guys who have your arrow and gun at the ready, both take a shot then they get a retribution shot.
Liam: Keyleth!
Marisha: What?
Liam: Let's go up!
Marisha: Go up?
Liam: Up to them, quick.
Marisha: I want see how they fare.
Liam: That’s going to be about 6 seconds.
Matt: The door is not magical. It is a mechanism of some kind.
Laura: 65. Oh, 65? (laughter) Shit.
Sam: I rolled a 65.
Liam: 65? Holy shit you're a deity!
Laura: I'm amazing!
Orion: Vax. Pay attention, the door mechanical, it is not magical. That's how we open it.
Laura: 25.
Matt: 25. Percy? And you get 2 attacks each. So - (zipping SFX)
Taliesin: I hit a 23.
Matt: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll second attack.
Taliesin: Okay, roll damage.
Matt: Well, roll both attacks first.
Laura: 18 for the second one.
Matt: Hits as well.
Taliesin: I have to reload with my second attack.
Matt: Oh right. Is this with the Bad News?
Taliesin: I've got the big gun out.
Matt: You’ve got the Bad News out. Okay then, yeah. So you fire and then reload. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: I'm using my fire bow.
Matt: You're using the fire bowstring. As you nock your first arrow, (swoosh sound) it bursts into flame as it hits your fingers.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Marisha: (dejected groan)
Taliesin: 7 damage.
Matt: 7 damage? Okay.
Taliesin: I'm so embarrassed.
Matt: I'm sorry.
Liam: (gunshot sound) You got me right in the ear.
Laura: 20 damage on the first attack.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Come on, Vex.
Laura: 13 on the second.
Matt: Okay, as both are going up with their crossbows ready to go, first one, Bad News - (gunshot sound) - with a cacophonous echoing gunshot that within this cavern, definitely carries some sound to it. And to some degree, suprise may be a little harder to find going forward.
Taliesin: They were ready to start shooting at us.
Matt: However, the shot hits the guy in the shoulder, knocks him off balance for a second. Not enough of a wound to prevent his next action. You, however, place one arrow into the other guy’s shoulder. He's dropped the crossbow. As he goes to reach for his other weapon, the other one just, right at the bottom of his throat, out the back of his head, and he just drops below the wall.
Ashley: Awesome.
Matt: The other one does get a crossbow shot off at you, Percy. That is a 23 versus armor class.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: You take 9 points of piercing damage. As the bolt just streaks you across the front of your torso. Passes through, thankfully, but you do feel there is a wound that’s slowly turning warmer beneath your armor.
Laura: Can I shoot at the other one?
Matt: That's been the round. Now, you guys have been inspecting the door. The door is not magical. There is some sort of contraption that opens it from the inside.
Liam: I’m getting my picks out, seeing if I can figure out some way to--
Matt: Go ahead and make a check with your thieves’ tools.
Liam: 29.
Matt: A 29. You take a second and you find that the contraption that holds this door in place definitely is on the other side. It's a series of winches and a chain pull. You find that there is one slight gap where you manage to hook one of the chains, pull it out ever so slightly, and you know with a strong yank from a strong person, you could probably pull it out from the outside.
Orion: Grog!
Travis: Sounds like we need a strong person.
Liam: So this is the part where I ask Grog over to pull. Grog, grab this--
Ashley: I'll do it! I'll do it. (all laugh)
Travis: Yeah, me and Pike are on this.
Ashley: I'll assist.
Matt: Grog, you reach over and grab the chain, and Pike grabs onto the back of you and you both pull.
Travis: Give it a good heave-ho.
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check with advantage.
Travis: Oh yeah, 23.
Matt: 23. As you pull, you hear the grinding of this chain against the stone, (cracking SFX) and you can see the actual door begin to rise upward this way.
Sam: It's a Delorean.
Matt: Essentially. When it opens up, it moves the magma out of the way. That's how this construct is used as an exit. It's what I mentioned before. This is supposed to be an exit for the royal individuals of the stronghold. It only opens part way, however, because the stone wall currently blocks the rest of its movement. However, you can still move through it.
Liam: We can't leave this duergar behind though, we gotta take him out.
Matt: Yes, there is one duergar still there. So that's been all of your guys' actions. We're bringing it back. Pike, you haven't gone yet.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Keyleth you've gone, so the only one left to take an action is--
Marisha: Tiberius, have you gone?
Matt: Yeah, he checked the doorway.
Marisha: Oh right.
Ashley: Where's he at?
Matt: He's up on top of the wall, about 25 feet from you.
Ashley: I want to create a spiritual weapon, like a poisonous lasso, and (whiff SFX) and then put him down into the lava.
Matt: Huh. Sure. (all laugh)
Sam: A lariat of truth?
Travis: That's awesome.
Taliesin: Well, all right then.
Matt: So using your spiritual weapon, you take a moment, you grasp your Sarenrae holy symbol around your neck, and as you pull your hand away from the symbol you see this glowing celestial rope extends out of nowhere. You begin to spin your fingers, and on its own, it begins to swirl and swirl. You then throw your hand forward and on its own, it cascades upward toward the edge of the wall. Go ahead and roll an attack roll.
Ashley: An attack roll? Which is?
Matt: Using your spell modifier as the attack bonus.
Ashley: 10.
Sam: Ooh. That ain't gonna do it.
Matt: Total of 10?
Ashley: I think so. (all laugh)
Matt: What'd you roll?
Ashley: I rolled a 2, and then I have a plus 8.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: That ain't no good.
Liam: It was a good idea though.
Laura: It was such a good idea.
Matt: The celestial lasso, which you don't get the feeling poison is something you could really muster based on your deity's central good--
Ashley: I was just kidding! I was just getting a little crazy with ideas.
Matt: I like it. However, as it heads over the wall, you see it does not find purchase on the duergar. It instead finds purchase on part of the wall.
Ashley: Fuck.
Travis: Poisoning the wall effectively.
Matt: Yes, it is now a poisoned property.
Ashley: (laughs) Poisoning that wall, effectively. Gosh dang it. That would have been cool.
Matt: That would have been cool, unfortunate bad roll.
Travis: It was going to be pretty cool.
Liam: Remember it for the future though.
Matt: That brings us to the top of the round order. I believe at the top we have--
Sam: Mister Me?
Matt: Yes, Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. Boy, oh boy. We're still trying to get that fucker up on the roof right?
Liam: Yes, he's going to run and tell people.
Sam: I've got almost nothing. So I'll just - can I summon an Unseen Servant to push him? (all laugh)
Marisha: Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
Matt: We can give it a shot.
Travis: Roll high. Roll really high.
Sam: I don't have any ranged weapons.
Laura: Natural 20!
Matt: So you conjure Unseen Servant. Mark off your spell use.
Orion: I look up and go, "Ooh, It's Monty's cousin."
Matt: You see a slight shimmer of ethereal energy behind the duergar. It's going to attempt to shove him. It isn't, unfortunately, on its own, extremely strong. It's mainly meant as an aide. However, it is possible. Go ahead and make an athletics check. Not your athletics, just make a d20 roll.
Sam: Just a normal athletics.
Liam: Come on, 20.
Sam: Yeah, I mean it's a 5, so. (all laugh)
Ashley: What's your athletics? We're really rolling well tonight.
Matt: You hear a (ting) sound as the duergar's armor is given a hefty slap, but no apparent force is placed upon its body.
Orion: A hefty slap.
Sam: Thank you, Jarvis! (all laugh)
Sam: But is he confused?
Matt: A little bit, but not enough to not be loading his crossbow for a second shot.
Sam: Damn it!
Matt: Good thinking on that point.
Marisha: We're a party of 7 people just like, "Aw, damn it, you!"
Taliesin: Like a cat in a tree, just - (beckoning whistle)
Sam: And I'm going to just give a little inspiration to Vax. That's Laura, obviously. (all laugh)
Laura: Yes, thank you.
Marisha: It inverted. That's what I always get mixed.
Matt: All right, a d8 inspiration die to you as Scanlan hums a little tune under his breath.
Laura: Nice.
Sam: (hums Dueling Banjos)
Matt: You're up.
Laura: Oh! I attack him.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Pew pew.
Ashley: Pew pew!
Laura: It's good.
Liam: It's a 1.
Marisha: Damn it! What is wrong with us?
Travis: What in the hot and holy shit is happening right now?
Ashley: What are we doing?
Matt: That's your first attack?
Laura: My first attack is a serious fail. My second attack, though, is a 25.
Matt: That hits.
Marisha: That's pretty cool.
Matt: So the first one you pull back, and as you pull back the actual arrow snaps.
Liam: You almost shot me!
Laura: Ow, that hurt my arm so bad.
Matt: Yeah, you're gonna have a little rash there probably tomorrow.
Laura: Great. 8.
Matt: 8 damage, all right. Your second arrow manages to find its mark. As it sticks pretty close to where the first arrow hit, or where he was shot from the Bad News. The duergar just shrugs it off angrily, and aims his crossbow from once on Percy, now onto you.
Laura: (nervously) Haha.
Matt: It's getting its shot at you. That is a 17 versus armor class.
Laura: Nope.
Matt: Nope?
Laura: Nope.
Matt: You manage to just dodge out of the way. You hear it whiz past your ear. That brings us to Percy.
Taliesin: I'll take one more shot at him.
Liam: Redemption, Percy.
Travis: Come on, buddy.
Sam: Kill this guy.
Ashley: Get it.
Sam: He's lasted longer than most of the people we fight.
Marisha: (laughing) Yeah he has.
Taliesin: 18?
Matt: 18 hits.
Taliesin: Come on die.
Travis: Come on, Percy.
Liam: Right in the belly button.
Marisha: Oh, that's nice. That's pretty.
Taliesin: That's 25 points of damage.
Travis: Thank you!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: With a second (click), you pull out one of your custom made, nasty looking bullets, load it back into Bad News. You pull it back, aim up, and fire. And once again, you guys are seeing this weapon up close again. With each fire, it takes all of his physical body to not get blown off his feet with each time it fires.
Laura: That's badass, Percy.
Matt: (thunder crack) A plume of white and ash-like smoke comes shooting out the side of the weapon. Nearby, you almost have to close your ears instinctually from the loudness of the shot. However, the duergar at the top of the wall, you see where his head once was just (wet impact SFX) across the wall behind it.
Ashley: I love Bad News.
Taliesin: Let's move quickly.
Laura: Let's get in the door.
Sam: I think they heard us.
Orion: I go in the door.
Taliesin: Going in the door.
Laura: We all go in the door.
Matt: All of you have made your way into the doorway.
Laura: Can Trinket fit? Trinket can fit.
Matt: Trinket can fit with you, yes.
Liam: Just barely.
Ashley: Just bear-ly.
Liam: It's like Winnie the Pooh, in the--
Laura: If Grog can fit, Trinket can fit.
Taliesin: It’s the one you don’t suit.
Travis: Oh no, we can't see anything.
Matt: You guys make your way into this tiny little room--
All: Whoa!
Matt: You're all very crammed in, to get anywhere.
Laura: Into this (high voice) teeny-tiny little room.
Liam: Feels like an intermission room.
Laura: Oh. A bathroom break room?
Liam: Yes. We could all relieve ourselves in this room.
Matt: You guys all slowly push into this storage room. It's very musty. It hasn't seen use in quite a while. In fact, you can see a little bit of mold is growing on the side of one of the barrels in the corner.
Orion: Ooh, dank.
Matt: There is a doorway that is closed on the opposite side of this wall, and from what you can see, there is a stairway that curves upwards to the second floor.
Laura: Ooh!
Sam: Guys, I'm sensing a lot of purple and brown construction paper here. (all laugh)
Orion: I am as well, Scanlan.
Liam: That's your favored terrain, right?
Sam: It is. (all laugh)
Laura: Can we take an intermission break at this moment?
Matt: I think as you guys just entered the stronghold, we'll take this as an intermission break. So take a little over 10 minutes. We'll watch the rest of the videos here again, and we'll return as the party has just entered the Emberhold itself.
Laura: All right. Oh wait, quick announcement.
Zac: A couple quick announcements.
Liam: Zac matches the construction paper.
Laura: What?!
Marisha: You do! (all laugh)
Zac: You can't see me! So guys before we go on intermission, I wanted to bring up one more time 826LA which is the charity that Critical Role is supporting. Do you want to give a brief--
Marisha: Yeah. A portion of our proceeds, or whatever our donations are, go to 826LA. They are an after-school tutoring program that help children between the ages of 5 and 18, mainly with literacy and creative writing and they have this awesome program where it's a young authors thing. You can buy all their books and their stories, and you should totally check them out.
Zac: Sweet!
Matt: Fantastic.
Zac: So guys, we can spam you with that link in the chatroom if you want to support a charity for Critical Role. We also still have a giveaway at 2150 subs, which is a picture of the entire Critical Role cast they've all signed, and it's really cool. We'll show that to you guys again later, but we'll go ahead and roll those videos for you guys again.
Matt: See if we can squeeze the intro again, that would be best. All right, cool guys, we'll see you again in a little bit.
Ashley: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream. A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar) (wet smack sounds) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! ...also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this... well this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. (weapon crack) Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. (brawling sounds) Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! ...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for... lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first Impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder crack) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third child of 7 children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men. As they ran, Percy’s sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (click sound) (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he’s never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it’s rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes. I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Singorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn’t last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (dragon roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough, (ringing weapons SFX) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Singorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear - her own stolen Trinket - to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages. (drumming battle music) (drumming battle music continues)
Orion: Still alive!
Matt: (laughs) Welcome back, guys. Welcome back to Critical Role. And we have Orion -- .
Liam: Holy hell.
Taliesin: Ow.
Marisha: Are you okay?
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Matt: 2d6 damage to Tiberius. So, guys, for those who are keeping up: two things, real fast. We want to thank Jacqueline Lassiter for the awesome food she sent for us.
All: (words of acclamation and thanks)
Matt: Seriously, thank you. A delightful, necessary treat after this game time. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. Also for the 2,150-subscriber mark, we're giving away this autographed photo of the cast.
Laura: Autographed photo.
Matt: We'll send out to you.
Liam: It's so handsome.
Marisha: Who is it going to?
Matt: Some lucky person in the chatroom once we hit 2,150.
Marisha: Oh. We don't know yet.
Matt: Whenever that happens, that will be going to you. So, yes, returning to the game--
Sam: Also, we've got these t-shirts. You should want them. (Laura and Marisha laugh)
Matt: We're going to now look into--
Marisha: Yes, let us know if you want them.
Laura: We're going to look into that.
Matt: We're going to look into possibly finding a way to get these shirts to you guys in the next couple weeks.
Marisha: Only if you want them, though. This is going to be a lot of work. We don't want to do it unless you really want them.
Orion: We hate doing work.
Travis: We're voice actors.
Taliesin: We're not here to work.
Sam: Where are we? We were just going in a door.
Matt: Indeed. You guys--
Liam: Come on. Yes, they want them.
Matt: Cool. I guess that feedback is good. The party had just managed to not-quite-so-stealthily pry their way into the hidden entrance to the outside of the duergar stronghold of Emberhold. They found themselves crammed into a very tiny, essentially a storage room, with a stairway leading up and a closed doorway leading further into the stronghold. So, what is your preference?
Laura: I think we should go through the door, instead of going up.
Liam: I agree.
Laura: Because any prisoners are probably going to be kept at a low level.
Taliesin: Can we quietly open the door?
Matt: Yeah, once inside.
Laura: Can we very stealthily try to open - oh, check for traps!
Liam: Yes, I'm going to sniff the door a bit.
Matt: All right.
Laura: (sniffing SFX)
Liam: Yeah, that's a 20.
Matt: 20? Best you can tell, the door itself is locked, but is not trapped.
Liam: Okay, well - (clinking SFX) Okay, thieves’ tools out. Oh, that's an easy 30.
Sam: 30?!
Matt: A 30!
Liam: 30.
Sam: Jesus.
Marisha: God damn.
Matt: Which is good because it's a very, very intricate lock. There is a specific key, a single key that is designed for this lock, that you gather is probably held by King Murghol himself.
Ashley: King Myrtle?
Laura: Mairgil. Mare - Mairgil?
Matt: Mur-ghol.
Marisha: Marigold.
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: Murghol.
Sam: And his queen, Durarara.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: Is that how you pronounce her name? Doo-gara-gar?
Liam: It's, uh, Ermahgerd?
All: Ermahgerd.
Laura: Ulara is her name.
Orion: Kuma.
Laura: Queen Ulara.
Sam: Ulara. Uhura.
Matt: Yes. Uhura.
Marisha: Uhura.
Taliesin: Kana.
Matt: Kumar.
Marisha: I don't know! What is her name? Seriously, what is her name, now?
Laura: It's Ulara! Ulara.
Sam: Ulara.
Marisha: What is -- ?
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: Ulara.
Marisha: Ulara. (giggles)
Matt: Shh.
Taliesin: Maybe not.
Marisha: Uladra. Right?
Liam: I'm picking a lock.
Laura: Shh. He's picking a lock. Be very quiet.
Liam: (clicking SFX)
Matt: However, you do manage to find a series of intricate, strangely-constructed dwarven tumblers on the inside that each have a very strange, rigid structure -- (laughs)
Liam: ‘Ey!
Matt: Please do that every time you pick a lock. You manage to get the right sequence, and with a slight - (clicking SFX) - clicking sound, (squeak SFX) the door opens slightly on the inside.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: It was pretty easy.
Matt: Leading into what you can see is a hallway, that continues further down to about there.
Liam: Where is the door? Where is the door that I just picked?
Matt: The door that you picked, if you wanted to walk through is right there.
Liam: It's naturally there.
Laura: So that other stuff is upstairs.
Matt: All of this is on the floor that you're on.
Laura: Oh! Okay.
Liam: I'm going to take six or seven quiet steps forward, stealthily. 19 stealth.
Matt: All right.
Orion: As he does this, I'm going to pull out my Ioun stone from my pouch, and let it-- (whirling SFX)
Matt: All right, cool.
Travis: We're all trapped in that room together, right?
Matt: You are. Correct.
Travis: I fart. (all laugh)
Orion: Oh! Grog! Prestidigitation, and I (whoosh SFX) make a quick wind-gust--
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Just circulate it around the room, will you?
Orion: I blew it away! I could blow it right up your nose, Vax! (fluttering SFX)
Travis: I'm closer to you now than I've ever been before.
Laura: I throw up in my mouth just a little bit.
Taliesin: Go around the corner and tell us what you see.
Matt: Just a little bit.
Orion: Oh. I'm sorry.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: Take a very quiet peek around the corner.
Liam: All right, I'm having a peeky-poo.
Taliesin: Quietly.
Matt: As you peek through, you can get a general idea of what looks to be some sort of an empty storage room. A lot of materials have been moved out of it. It looks like the remnants of stone, things that were used for construction that once were in this room that have been pulled out to build things. Possibly moved as part of the war camp to start building some of the siege weapons that you saw above.
Liam: Do I hear anything?
Matt: Not currently. Roll a perception check.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Oh, that's good.
Liam: That's pretty good. 27.
Matt: Listening, you hear footsteps above. You hear very, very faintly through the stonework about 20 feet above you - (thumping SFX) - some footsteps moving above. Apparently there is some level of alert on the second floor.
Laura: Oh, shit. We should move fast.
Marisha: Hmm. I wonder why.
Liam: Go figure.
Laura: We should get out of the room.
Orion: Yes, Percy, I wonder why.
Laura: We start getting out of the room.
Taliesin: It’s a wonder, looking outside.
Liam: I go back to the door and just be like--
Laura: (whispering) Come on. Hurry!
Liam: So, I want to go further - no doorway, as of yet. Correct?
Matt: No doorway here.
Liam: If I go this way--
Laura: They're going to start coming down these fricking stairs in this room.
Matt: This way? It ends. The hallway comes to an end, with a wall.
Liam: Well then, I'm going to peek into this door here. This open door.
Matt: Here?
Liam: No. What's right by the figure?
Matt: This is the one you just looked into that had this empty room that--
Liam: Thank you, thank you. So, down the one hall.
Matt: Down the one hall. Look past here there is a stairway that descends downward.
Liam: Down.
Matt: Looking down - pardon me. Looking down this hallway, you see what resembles - there's a door to your left that's closed currently, and it splits off into two directions, right and left.
Liam: Right, I don't even tell anyone. I just start to slink down the steps.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Did he go down?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Oh, geez Louise.
Matt: Okay. Put Clarota there. You continue down the stairway, and as you slowly move around, you can see down towards the bottom a very faint bit of reddish glow-stone light and a hallway that splits right and left. Laura: (whispering) We should go downstairs.
Liam: Right and left? I go to the right.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Why don’t we just go left?
Laura: We're getting bored.
Matt: As you look past the right - you guys are all waiting in the room?
Liam: You should just storm in.
Laura: I get out.
Liam: Start banging your weapons together.
Laura: No! I come out, because you're taking too long.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: Anyone else?
Orion: I saunter about. (all laugh)
Ashley: I'll head on out there.
Sam: I go where Pike goes.
Marisha: We're just losing all attention span? Is that what's going on? We're just wandering off.
Laura: No no no. I said we stay in the area, but I wanted to check on my brother because I feel like he's taking awhile.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And he was just gonna check the doors.
Matt: As you move and glance over, you can see there are two duergar stationed on each side of the split hallways. One is a closed doorway to your right, and to the left there's an open doorway that leads into a room.
Liam: And that's when I went to the right?
Matt: Well, as soon as you went into where the division was, you turned to the right and there were duergar there, and a duergar on the left.
Liam: I'm going to turn my chin over to the left, and see what I see down there.
Matt: There's a second duergar that is currently sitting in armor, weapon to its side. Just occasionally glancing in. You can hear, every now and then, sounds like a moan or a slight whispering gurgle, and the duergar will lean in - "Hey, shut up in there! 'Kay?!"
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to go kill this guy.
Laura: You don't want to tell us what you found?
Orion: As I notice him going up, I'm going to - (click) Vax, what are you doing?
Liam: (softly) Uh, I'm killing someone. Hold, please. (all laughing)
Sam: (humming a Muzak version of "The Girl from Ipanema")
Orion: Uh, guys, Vax is going to go kill something.
Marisha: It's okay. Let him do it by himself. It's what he does best.
Liam: I'm going to sneak up on this duergar.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Orion: I worry.
Marisha: I know. It's okay.
Liam: 19?
Matt: 19? Let me go ahead and--
Laura: Oh, no! Look at this.
Matt: This'll be an interesting--
Liam: Like a magician, you just whip it out, Matt.
Matt: That's what I'm doing. Trying, at least. There we go.
Travis: Do you want an extra hand?
Taliesin: If Mr. Wizard can do it, you can do it.
Sam: Watch out! LAURA It's that book.
Matt: Oh, it is the book, isn't it? Stupid book. As you've made your way here, Vex [sic] you look to the right. There's the duergar here to the left that's shouting into this room here.
Sam: Do something!
Matt: You missed entirely what I was telling you.
Travis: Will you fucking do something, please?
Liam: He's right there on the side. There's one over there, there's one over there. There's two. Oh, shit. Well, we all come slamming down in here.
Sam: Yeah!
Travis: No, you're down there.
Liam: So I sneak back up and I put a hand on my sister's shoulder, and I give her a little come along motion. And tell everyone else--
Sam: Don't you need some Grog?
Liam: --I mouth "Kima" at everybody, and then pull my sister down.
Matt: As you're doing this, you hear footsteps across the way echoing through the hallway, what sounds like a number of other foot patters heading through the halls--
Laura: (gasps) We should just go down.
Matt: --towards the front of the stronghold.
Liam: I'm just pulling Vex down.
Orion: The front? Oh, the front of the front. Not where we're at, right?
Matt: Vex and Vax both disappear off to the side, down a hallway.
Marisha: Before they leave I just tap their shoulders and meditate and grant them Guidance.
Matt: Okay, you can give one of them Guidance because it's concentration.
Marisha: Uh, Vex.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: That's me.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Fuck.
Laura: Did you mean to give it to him?
Marisha: Yes. (everyone laughs)
Orion: Brava.
Matt: All right, who gets guidance?
Sam: The man one.
Matt: Vax.
Marisha: Vax.
Liam: So I pull my poison blade out and I pull the keen dagger out. Okay, and I take the keen dagger - so the one on the left is by the door and the one that muttered through the doorway, right?
Matt: The one right here.
Liam: So I give a little fwip, toss in my hand and throw it right at his neck.
Laura: At the same time I reach out and I go (arrow SFX).
Liam: And the other one, the poison one, toward the other.
Matt: Okay and you are?
Laura: And I was going to shoot at the other one.
Matt: Go ahead and roll for this guy here.
Liam: That guy. That is a 17 for me.
Matt: 17 hits.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27, all right.
Liam: And then on the other guy, or should I just go ahead and attack?
Matt: Go ahead and attack both.
Liam: 17. So that’s--
Laura: And 25 on the same.
Matt: Both arrows on the guy on the right?
Laura: Let’s do both, one on each.
Matt: Each? (shooting SFX) You both - (impact SFX) - ?
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: Okay, cool. Damage on the one on the left? Which is sneak attack because he didn’t know you were there.
Liam: So, 46 with the keen dagger on the guard at the door.
Taliesin: Damn.
Laura: So I was really useful!
Matt: The guy on the left, as he’s leaning back, he’s getting angry with whoever is in that room. As he turns back to take his post again, (swoosh SFX) (gurgling) he just gurgles, slumps to the ground. As he’s slumping, an arrow goes (impact sound) into his stomach. (everyone laughs)
Liam: It’s like a punctuation.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Matt: Roll damage for the second attack.
Liam: The poison dagger goes (thunk sound). Well, I didn’t roll to hit him.
Matt: And you are using the poison effect on him?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: 15 on the other guy for me.
Liam: That is a 19.
Matt: Okay, that hits. Now roll damage.
Liam: This doesn’t get sneak attack?
Matt: No.
Liam: Because I already used that. I made some noise hitting the first guy. 7 plus the poison.
Matt: What is the poison damage?
Liam: The poison is DC 15.
Matt: He does not make the save, even though he’s a duergar.
Laura: I go running back up since I’ve already shot my arrows.
Matt: Let me check one thing real fast.
Laura: And I figured you’ve got this.
Matt: Check one thing.
Ashley: He could just clear this whole place by himself.
Liam: 9 points of poison on him.
Matt: Okay. So, an arrow (impact SFX) into his chest just as the poison blade makes contact. You can see him (gurgling SFX) double over for a second, but the hardy duergar once-dwarven form seems to shrug off a lot of the poison’s impact.
Laura: Oh, shit!
Matt: He is still dribbling a very heavy amount of deep crimson from his mouth, but he still (gasps) looks over and sees you both in the hallway and goes to reach for his warhammer and turn around towards the door behind him.
Laura: Can I throw an arrow at him?
Liam: Do we roll for initiative at this point?
Matt: You guys roll for initiative to see who goes first.
Sam: I turn to Pike and say, "What the fuck is going on? Where are they?"
Orion: I don’t know, but this book, Scanlan, is incredible.
Sam: I’m sure it is.
Orion: It’s all about this, er, an ice thing--
Sam: I read non-fiction.
Orion: --and these other things.
Ashley: Let’s head down there. I’m going to head down there.
Liam: Careful, clanky.
Ashley: Oh.
Matt: So the rest of you are heading down there?
Travis: I follow Pike down there.
Sam: I’m going, too.
Laura: There are so many prisoners down this way.
Matt: Everyone else roll stealth checks.
Laura: Everybody fucking come down.
Marisha: Are we going down?
Matt: Stealth checks everyone. You guys both beat him on initiative.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Roll attacks, both of you, just roll the dice.
Sam: Roll the dice.
Orion: Roll the dice.
Ashley: 19.
Liam: 28.
Ashley: Getting a handle on my armor.
Matt: Okay. You don’t need to roll damage. He has like, 2 hit points left. You guys pepper him with additional arrows and daggers. The poor guys is like: "Uh, I’m gonna--" (impact SFX, gurgle) He just goes down with this horrible sense of overkill, his body just slumps up against the door, leaning against the wooden door he was guarding.
Laura: I say on my earring "I think we found the prison cells. Get down here."
Sam: We’re coming.
Orion: I’m assuming they’re dead.
Matt: Both duergar.
Liam: I start to loot the bodies.
Matt: Stealth checks?
Orion: 16.
Marisha: 17.
Taliesin: 12.
Sam: 12.
Travis: 20.
Ashley: 19.
Matt: All right, go team!
Marisha: Woo! We’re stealthy bastards.
Matt: That was with disadvantage?
Ashley: I have to roll again?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Why?
Matt: Because you’re in heavy plate armor.
Marisha: No!
Laura: No!
All: (words of encouragement)
Ashley: (laughs)
Laura: That’s not bad, that’s still not bad.
Ashley: I rolled an 8.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Plus what?
Ashley: Plus nothing. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (clanking SFX)
Matt: You guys, all rush down the stairs (stomping SFX) the clanking of the plate armor as you're going down. The rest of you wince as you notice it, but you make it down anyway.
Ashley: (laughing) Oh my God.
Travis: I should have picked you up.
Marisha: I'm actually going to go ahead and throw Guidance on Pike now.
Sam: Little late, little late.
Taliesin: What does Guidance do?
Marisha: It gives you a plus on your ability checks. And it gives you a 1d4 plus to your-- (several talking at once)
Sam: Do they already knew [sic] we were here? Now they really know.
Matt: So, the rest of you have made it down.
Liam: Surprise!
Matt: In this hallway, there are 2 dead duergar on the ground. One with a closed door and one with an open door.
Laura: Well, let's go look in the open door. Stealthily.
Matt: You glance over into the open door, you can see what appears to be a series of dungeon cells held underneath the stronghold.
Liam: Lady Kima?
Matt: Within these, you can see there are a number of dwarven captives that are in very, very, very poor health--
Taliesin: I don't care about them.
Laura: We need to get them awake.
Matt: --that are currently lying down, unfed, gaunt.
Sam: Are any of them Lady Kima? Because if they're not, they're about to die.
Laura: No, they're regular dwarves, they're good people.
Orion: I go inspect them and see what's going on.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'll go in with Tiberius.
Matt: Okay, you guys enter. As you look around, there are a series of largely decomposed bodies in a few of these cells. They are people who've just been left to die.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: One, there are these kind of strange deep underground, rat-like creatures that are feeding on one of them. One of the dwarves is just wheezing in pain (moaning). You can see his stomach is a little distended. The other one is either unconscious, asleep, or dead. You can't tell.
Ashley: Can I do a Mass Cure on them?
Matt: You can if you'd like.
Ashley: Okay. I'll do that.
Liam: Yes, I was about to say. I'm going to go start inspecting the other door.
Taliesin: I'll go with him.
Laura: Why don't you unlock the prison cells here?
Marisha: Yeah, can you unlock the prison cells?
Liam: Oh, sorry.
Laura: Can we go in? Can we talk to them?
Matt: If you guys want to. So you go through. It's fairly simple over time for you to unlock the cells if you'd like, the 2 that are in there. There's a difference between healing magic and nutrition. You make them feel physically better for the moment, but their physical form itself is failing.
Travis: Just a thought, shouldn't we clear this mess before we let prisoners out?
Matt: They need food, they need air, they need to be out of here soon. They're both on the edge of death.
Sam: Put them in the bag of holding, Grog.
Marisha: I pull out a water.
Orion: I go to the room, I take out my bottle of water..
Marisha: I'll do the opposite one.
Matt: You guys hear heavy footsteps coming from the stairway you guys just descended from.
Travis: I go stand right next to the stairway.
Marisha: In the cells, in the cells.
Taliesin: In the cells, in the cells.
Liam: I pull my sister and we flank. I push her into flanking position to the door.
Laura: Oh God, I nock an arrow, notch an arrow?
Orion: Where are they coming from?
Liam: The stairs, from where we entered?
Matt: What are you guys doing?
Marisha: I jump in the cells and I pull a dead, decomposing corpse over the top of me.
Laura: Eww, Keyleth. All kinds of nastiness.
Taliesin: I find a corner of a cell and slowly pull out my gun.
Marisha: I’m going savage! (all laugh)
Taliesin: I should make sure all the doors are shut, not locked.
Matt: All right, all the doors are shut. Pike, anything you doing?
Ashley: I'm just, you know, preparing.
Matt: (laughs) All right.
Marisha: Just kicking it, just chilling.
Laura: Do we need to move out of the way of the stairs?
Liam: Vax is scooching Scanlan out of the way to take that position right there.
Taliesin: The bear is at the back cell.
Laura: Scanlan, where are you?
Sam: There's voices coming from the stairs?
Liam: Yeah, someone's coming.
Sam: But there's a bear in the stairs.
Laura: Well, Trinket's coming down.
Marisha: I call, "Trinket, Trinket, Trinket (kissing SFX) Trinket!"
Matt: Trinket barely hears you from way over at the side.
Marisha: (kissing SFX) Come on.
Matt: He's coming into this room. Clarota just steps back, along the side of the stairs and out of view. A few moments pass as the footsteps slowly trail off.
Orion: I leave and turn around where Vex and Vax are.
Marisha: I know.
Laura: What's in the other door?
Matt: The other door is currently locked from what you can tell.
Liam: One moment. It is now not locked, I think.
Matt: (chuckles)
Liam: 25?
Matt: (clicking SFX) You push the door open and you see immediately, the fast moving heft of some large blade towards your head.
Sam: Oh, snap!
Laura: Oh, it's Kima.
Liam: No, it's a trap ready to hit me.
Matt: That is 24 versus armor class.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: That hits, all right.
Laura: Oh, you didn't check for traps.
Liam: Didn't check for traps.
Travis: I thought you were good at this shit.
Liam: I'm going to use uncanny dodge.
Matt: What would have been 20 points of slashing damage is reduced to 10. So you take 10 damage as the axe (impact SFX) hits you and imbeds itself in the wooden door, pulls back. Now you see as a duergar wearing this nasty-looking black leather tunic with a hood pulled back, with a giant, gnarled, hefted greataxe, words escaped me on that one, has a bunch of scars on its face. As it's grinning, it pulls the axe out of the doorway.
Liam: Right, I spit on the ground, and yank my belt off and throw it at his head.
Laura: And I yell ‘hold.’
Matt: Okay. As you throw the belt--
Sam: Hold?
Laura: Yeah, tell him to stop attacking.
Liam: Yeah, serpent.
Matt: --he ducks out of the way, pulls back out of the way, as the snake forms itself. It goes ahead and makes its attack. Go ahead and roll for snake attack against him.
Sam: Snake attack!
Liam: Okay, 12 plus, I don't know what, 12. Is my attack, his attack, snake attack?
Matt: Did you roll a 12 on that?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, that will not hit unfortunately.
Liam: All right.
Matt: As he slaps it off himself and it (swish SFX) cascades off to the side of the room.
Ashley: Is he in a cell?
Travis: Is a base attack a straight line from him to Vax to--
Sam: He's protecting the cells.
Ashley: He's protecting the cells.
Matt: At which point he kicks the door closed again.
Travis: Can I, in my rage, bullrush through this?
Sam: Yes, yes.
Matt: Now roll initiative, guys.
Orion: As he's going I immediately cast Stone Skin on myself. (cracking SFX)
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What I like is that there are 8 of us and 1 of him.
Laura: Possibly, if no one else is behind that door.
Taliesin: So far.
Laura: He's in a room by himself.
Liam: I can see the square, it's very small.
Matt: You've looked inside, seeing a brief bit of the room. 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 26.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 26, all right Percy.
Liam: (shooting SFX)
Matt: All right. 20 to 15?
Marisha: 18.
Laura: 15.
Orion: 19.
Matt: 15 to 10?
Travis: 14.
Matt: 14. 10 to 5?
Ashley: 7.
Matt: 5 to 1?
Sam: (nervously) 4.
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up first.
Taliesin: Where am I?
Matt: You are way back in this cell, and you hear a slam of broken wood and another slam of a door closing.
Taliesin: I'm going to run to the hall.
Matt: Make an acrobatics check to try and move through this cluster of people here.
Taliesin: I can do that. 24.
Matt: 24. You leap over, vaulting off of Trinket, land and move into this hallway. And that's the extent of your movement.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to try and take a shot and blow the lock.
Matt: Okay, with the Bad News or with your--?
Taliesin: Oh no, Bad News is away. This is just with the handheld, shooting at the lock at the door.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: Jesus H, 30.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: 9 points of damage.
Matt: 9 points of damage. As the door slams back and you prepare yourself to try and kick it open, you hear the familiar (zoom SFX) of one of Percy's pepperbox bullets as the actual handle of the door (impact SFX) gets blown off and there's a small hole in the wooden door now where its handle once was. The door swings open a little bit loosely due to the impact. That ends your turn.
Taliesin: That ends my turn.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay. All I'm gonna do is grab the hole of the door and yank it open and yell, "Your turn, Grog!"
Marisha: Oh! That's fun!
Matt: As you pull it open, the dwarf backs up over what you can see now, this room is completely covered in a series of really nasty, hooked instruments. Hot irons, you can see large pincers--
Travis: (laughs excitedly)
Matt: --you can see various blades.
Ashley: Oh, it's like a torture chamber?
Matt: It's a torture chamber. (all groan)
Travis: It's Christmas!
Taliesin: Grog is running into Toys R Us. This is going to be great.
Matt: You see gently as he backs away there is someone on this rack-like table. The dwarf backs up with his axe getting ready.
Liam: I use my bonus action to say, "You are so fucked, dwarf." (all laugh)
Matt: All right, that brings us to Tiberius.
Orion: I like where this is going, Vax. Wait, I go over there first and then I say that. (all laugh)
Matt: Acrobatics check.
Orion: Acrobatics, why?
Sam: You gotta jump over people.
Matt: You've got to move through people. The area is congested. Small spaces, man. Downside of a big party.
Orion: Okay. 22.
Matt: 22. You manage to move through, push the bear out of the way. Move, Trinket. Get out the way!
Orion: (muttering) Bear!
Matt: You manage to make your way, squeeze past Percy.
Orion: The bear surprisingly smells really nice.
Matt: All right, Tiberius, what do you want to do now?
Orion: I'm going to follow suit as I see what Vax is doing. I'm going to cast Hold Person on the dwarf.
Matt: You don't have visual on the dwarf currently, the dwarf is back--
Orion: What? That's absurd!
Matt: As you run through the hallway - which you don't know there's a dwarf there - you rush out to the hallway after hearing all this commotion. You look in and there's an open door into a room that's currently vacant. You don't have enough movement to get close enough, unfortunately.
Orion: Oh well, poop. I... I encourage violence. (all laugh)
Matt: A wondrous use of an action.
Orion: Do it! Do it, Grog! Destroy them! With no regard to any of his existence.
Matt: Keyleth.
Travis: (laughing) I encourage violence!
Liam: That's the best line of the night! (laughs)
Matt: You are currently in a cell with a dead body draped over you. (all laughing)
Marisha: It's cozy down here. Okay, so with the dead body, I hear what's going on - we're roleplaying it up!
Orion: Get the body off of you.
Marisha: I morph into Minxy form.
Travis: Minxy!
Marisha: And as I morph into Minxy form, I take the dead body that's on top of me and just pick it up with my mouth.
Matt: In your mouth, the body stirs. It wasn't quite dead.
Marisha: Oh, why?!
Laura: (Gasps) Oh, Keyleth!
Marisha: It was supposed to be - I wanted the dead one.
Travis: Minxy says I'm sorry!
Marisha: Can I drop that one and find a dead one?
Matt: Well, you wanted a dead one. It is now.
All: Oh!
Marisha: That's fine, that's fine.
Liam: Oh, murdering children again.
Taliesin: Spend the entire game being the worst person in the world.
Marisha: I know! I try so hard, you guys!
Travis: Was it a child duergar?
Marisha: I try so hard, I'm still the fucking worst!
Matt: So, you now have a dead, gaunt dwarf, hanging from Minxy's mouth. (all laugh)
Matt: What do you want to do?
Sam: Keep chewing.
Marisha: Um, it was...
Travis: Oh, go ahead, do something else.
Taliesin: At least it's not gamey, it’s fresh.
Marisha: Keyleth tries. Keyleth tries so hard.
Orion: You're not trying hard enough, damn it!
Marisha: Fuck you man, all right? I'm having a tough day.
Travis: You hear a little dwarf in the corner go "Mommy?"
Marisha: Vex brought up the fact that I killed a kid. I’m having all these memories coming back, I'm on the brink.
Matt: Yeah, there's some PTSD coming through.
Marisha: So I've got this now-dead corpse in my mouth and I come out around the corner.
Matt: Make an Acrobatics check. Because you’re still moving through this clustered hallway with a dead dwarf in your mouth.
Liam: Holy cow!
Marisha: I'm a tiger so--
Liam: That was Greyspine's cousin.
Marisha: Can I have an advantage? Oh, I rolled a 15. Plus being a tiger?
Matt: You're fine. You manage to push through, you're leaping through.
Marisha: I'm pouncy. And I come out into the hallway.
Matt: You actually shift Tiberius out of the way. This is a very small space, you're a very big cat. You're really pushing for space here.
Marisha: Move!
Matt: It's very, very tight quarters for you, you're like - (struggling SFX)
Orion: Keyleth, as a cat, you smell less good as Trinket does.
Marisha: It's not me, it's the dead body.
Orion: Oh. That's disgusting.
Marisha: And I look at the dwarf.
Matt: You can't see him from your vantage point, he's actually back out of sight.
Orion: I can't see him, you can't see him.
Marisha: No? Can I shift to see him at all?
Matt: You don't know there's a dwarf there. You just know there's some sort of commotion going on. You move around the corner and you see just an empty room.
Liam: Everybody give up your turn to Grog.
Laura: I know, let him go in the room.
Orion: Just let Grog deal with this butthole.
Marisha: I look at Grog and I foam at the mouth a little bit with the corpse and I--
Sam: Encourage violence.
Marisha: --I encourage violence. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. Vex?
Marisha: Just gnawing on the dead dwarf.
Laura: Oh, well, let's make this nice and easy. I smack Grog on the ass and say, "Go get him".
Travis: (eager snarling)
Matt: All right, Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: (eager snarling continues)
Marisha: Does he get advantage because we're all encouraging violence?
Orion: Yeah, or inspiration?
Matt: Oh no, you get inspiration dice for this whole set up. 1d8 inspiration dice.
Sam: You don't kill him in one shot, it's very very disappointing.
Matt: All right, you run in.
Travis: You said the room was full of shiny pointy things on the wall, right?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: I would like to bull rush the dwarf up and against the wall, try and spear him with all the sharp shit on the wall.
Matt: Okay!
All: (cheering)
Matt: Oh, that's nasty. Okay then, so for the-- (laughs)
Liam: Instant karma's going to get you, man.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: You hear that, Keyleth?
Marisha: (growling)
Travis: 24.
Matt: Yeah, against his 7. You rush in and with your first attack, you grab him, lift him, and you can see there's a series of giant meat hooks hanging from the back of the wall, and you just lift him up and (impaling SFX) shove him down onto the hook which protrudes from the front of his chest. (gurgling SFX)
Travis: No, perfect. Tell me I get another attack.
Matt: You do.
Travis: Excellent!
Matt: That's 12 points of damage and he's currently restrained by the hook through his chest.
Laura: Impaled? Oh!
Travis: Perfect! With my second attack as he's screaming out I reach inside, grab his lower jaw and pull him straight down.
Matt: Okay, make an attack roll.
Laura: Oh no! That's so gross.
Ashley: Oh, I love this so much.
Liam: Vax is using his free hand to cover his eyes.
Sam: Keyleth starts eating him.
Travis: (laughing) 24.
Matt: (laughs) Go ahead and roll damage on this.
Laura: Oh, sick.
Travis: With a 12?
Matt: For flavor, roll a 12. Why not? You're pulling his jaw.
Travis: Excellent! (laughing)
Ashley: He rolled really high.
Travis: 15.
Matt: After you throw him onto the hook, his axe clatters to the ground and he reaches up with his hands to grab you and it looks like he's pulling back to try and bring you in for a headbutt. This angry look of burning rage in his white eyes, this fucked-up duergar with all these scars on his face, as he reaches up towards you, you take your giant hand and jam it into his maw. With this horrible (choking SFX) sound, as you put all your muscle into it, glaring him in the face with a terrible grin you (breaking SFX) and yank the jaw off from the bottom of his head.
All: (cheering)
Matt: A spatter of blood across the front of his mouth and his tongue dangling, he gives out this horrible (gagging scream) this gurgling scream as all the blood begins to pour up into his throat. With that, clutching the jaw with one hand, you begin to pummel him in the face over and over, with his jaw, as he's watching, his head slowly cave in.
Travis: (laughing) Yes!
Sam: I think he's going to make it.
Matt: Until eventually, he's no longer moving and you throw the jaw to the ground, just coated with blood.
Liam: You're going to pull through, buddy.
Laura: Pike! I think Grog, um, I think he did his job.
Ashley: I scream out, "Good job Grog! That's your best one yet!"
Marisha: And they say video games are violent. (all laugh)
Laura: (gagging sounds)
Matt: As you've entered the room now--
Ashley: Wait, is he dead? (all laugh)
Matt: Oh, he's very dead.
Travis: We made cheese of him.
Matt: He lies there limply on the wall, twitching every few seconds. Grog, still in a rage, you look over at the other individual. You can see now strapped to this wooden frame is a smallish humanoid, female, currently chained and being pulled on a rack. You can see bunch of scars and wounds, blood pouring from each one of them.
Sam: Is that our girl?
Laura: That's our girl!
Taliesin: I'm running in. Do I know how to disable the rack?
Matt: You can probably figure it out with a tinker.
Liam: Pike!
Travis: Is it chains or rope?
Laura: Come heal her!
Liam: We need Pike in here!
Travis: Is it chains or rope?
Sam: I'll go!
Matt: It's chains holding her on.
Taliesin: I'm going to undo it.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Wait. Do we know it's her?
Matt: Go ahead and make a tinker check.
Laura: It's her. It's gotta be her.
Orion: Whoever it is, we should help.
Taliesin: What do I add? Is it proficiency bonus?
Matt: Proficiency bonus.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: 12? You take a moment and you manage to find where the winch to this machine is, where you can go ahead and release the tension and eventually the chains go a little more slack and (gasps) the halfling woman takes a deep breath and looks about the room a second, looks like there's a bit of a haze, but through the haze there's this constant anger and she looks down and goes: "So? Are you gonna let me go? Come on! Release these chains!"
Ashley: Who is she?
Travis: Wait, wait. Find out who she is first.
Laura: Can we insight and make sure that it's really who she--
Matt: You can indeed. This is an insight check.
Laura: Great, I don't get any... Anybody else want to roll for insight?
Liam: 5, 1. Pike, roll well. The twins fucked it.
Ashley: Insight?
Liam: Scanlan! Come up here!
Sam: Yeah, yeah, oh.
Ashley: 15! 15?
Liam: She's not in her right mind.
Matt: It's a very small room, only a few people can make it in here.
Sam: I'm gonna take a peek at her. What do I do? What do I roll?
Liam: Insight to see if she's in her right mind.
Ashley: 15? 18 is better.
Matt: At this point, it's pretty apparent that whatever this woman is, she's been here a while and has been subjected to many, many horrible things and still has that spark of life to her, mainly out of vengeance, anger, and pain, but she does not seem to be overtly aggressive or trying to deceive you; just trying to get out of these fucking chains.
Laura: Well, let's let her go.
Orion: I'll do an Arcana check on her.
Matt: What's that? Arcana check? To...?
Orion: See if there's like any kind of magical impurities in her.
Travis: If she's under the Imperius Curse.
Matt: Best you can tell, there's none.
Liam: I'm pulling out my lockpicks and I'm going to start working on--
Sam: I'm going to heal her with a little bit of a song.
Liam: And you know my lockpick snaps so... just totally broken.
Ashley: How hurt is she?
Sam: If I may.
Matt: She's pretty rough. As you look up, she's not clothed. Her body is just a spray of scars and gashes and rake marks. She's been tortured to an extent you hadn't seen in person, and to still be tensing her muscles against the chains and looking at you with this intensity, if this is indeed Lady Kima, you now see why she's made the reputation she has.
Liam: Grog, the locking mechanism on this is jammed.
Sam: Okay. So, I step forward and I pull out my flute and I sing, (singing) "As long as I got my song and flute, I'm gonna give some healing to you. Love and magic in the air tonight, gonna give you some hit points. Gonna give you some hit points, gonna give you some hit points of our love." (all laugh)
Sam: Dadadanana, okay. I roll 9 hit points.
Matt: The fresher wounds seal up, the blood flow comes to a stop. You see her muscles tense for a moment - her tension in her muscles relax for a minute. She looks to you for a second and says, "It's been a while since I've heard a song. Thank you."
Sam: It was a slow jam.
Taliesin: Please be careful for a moment. Can someone cover her ears for just a second?
Travis: Yeah, I got it.
Ashley: Earmuffs.
Taliesin: I'm going to utility shot - I'm going to put my gun against the lock, somewhere where it will not harm her and just blow it.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage. You don't have to roll to hit, it's right there.
Taliesin: 15. Is it two locks?
Matt: Well, there's one chain for the legs, one chain for the arms.
Taliesin: Okay. 15 for the leg. 10 for the arm.
Matt: (gunshot sound) The legs get free. (gunshot sound) The chain mostly snaps on the top part, but not quite enough. It's enough for you, Grog, to-
Travis: I got it! (snarling)
Matt: You reach over and bring it down, with a brief moment of extreme tension as the whole room watches Grog walk up with his axe and swing it down towards this halfling. Before you have a moment to stop, everyone's heart skips a beat. The chain is bisected--
Liam: Ease down! Ease down.
Matt: --at which point the halfling woman immediately jumps to her feet with almost like a kip-up stand and is now standing on top of the table. Her arms are still bound and she - (groans) You can now see where the metal was weakened from the axe blow. She (metal snapping SFX) pulls herself free from the metal binding--
Travis: That's hot.
Matt: --there's a blister across her wrist, from how long she's been pulling against these restraints. But she bore through it, with a little bit of blood that trickles from that wound. She has freed herself and she looks around the rest of the group. "So, I take it you're not from around here?"
Orion: No! Would you like some water?
Matt: She grabs it from you, pulls off the cork and just starts chugging like she hasn't had anything to drink in a long time.
Laura: Lady Kima, we need to get you out of here.
Liam: Allura has sent us.
Matt: She caps it off after a moment and takes a deep breath. "I'd hoped she would. It was foolish of me to come down here so unprepared. Just knew there wasn't much time." (chuckles)
Liam: Time 'til what?
Matt: She looks around and says, "Look, we don't- it's a story. I have no--" And she kind of points to her pretty much unclothed, unarmored form, and says, "I need to find my implements. We need to get out of here."
Travis: Could I offer to you this black, studded leather, dwarven armor? It's not leather, actually.
Liam: It's magical, it'll fit you.
Orion: Would you care for this robe?
Laura: Which sounds better?
Matt: What armor were you offering her?
Travis: It's the black, dwarven armor--
Liam: The armor that I found and gave to Grog. It's magical.
Matt: Oh, the studded leather.
Liam: Yes.
Travis: It's in the bag.
Matt: She goes, "Sure, it works for now." She takes it from you and starts putting it on. You see her wincing as she puts it on, as it covers some of the wounds. Her whole body is just sore, but she still pushes through it.
Ashley: I'm going to heal her a little bit more.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I'll put my hands on her. I'm sorry. You're not fully healed, let me help you out.
Travis: (quietly) Grog likes scars.
Matt: As you do, she takes a moment and she says - You heal her and she goes, "Can I-" She sees your mace and goes, "Can I borrow that for a second?"
Ashley: Uh...
Matt: "Please?"
Ashley: My mace?
Matt: "Your mace, please."
Ashley: What do you need it for? (all laugh)
Travis: You can have mine.
Matt: "Do you trust me?"
Ashley: I don't know. This is all I have to protect myself.
Matt: "You've come this far."
Orion: Grog has something for you.
Sam: Say yes to life, Pike.
Ashley: All right, well, I also have a morningstar, but this is-- (all laugh)
Ashley: Are you gonna give it back?
Matt: As you hand it out, she grabs it from your hands--
Ashley: That was rude.
Matt: --walks to the edge of the table--
Ashley: I don't like her.
Matt: --stares at the dwarf that is currently hooked onto the wall. (angry yell) And with a yell, slams it right into his face, causing his head to explode against the back of the wall. Slams it again and again and again, and is just making hamburger of his entire body. The arm sloughs off and she's just going nuts. You can see her bludgeoning over and over again with a spray of gore on her. And there's this look of anger, frustration--
Laura: She's raging.
Matt: --and a sick sense of joy a little bit in her eyes in how she's just tearing this dwarf apart. Eventually, after this frenzy, you're all taken aback, and she takes a moment. (heavy breathing) There is very little left recognizable of what once was a duergar.
Sam: I notice a bulge in Grog's pants. (all laugh)
Orion: I use my Mage Hand to slowly pick up my bottle of water... (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. She takes the mace she borrowed from you. (splatter sound)
Ashley: I'm sorry I questioned you.
Matt: As she begins to hand it back to you, there's a slight flash of radiant energy that emanates from her hand, and it burns all of the blood that currently encapsulates the mace off, and hands it back to you. "Thank you. I needed that."
Ashley: You're very welcome. I'm sorry I questioned you.
Orion: Give her something, Grog! Let her use one of your things!
Travis: That was amazing. (all laugh)
Orion: Like, you know, give her one of your things, Grog.
Travis: Could I, um, would you like to touch my axe? (all laugh)
Matt: "If you want to part with it, certainly."
Travis: Oh, uh. (clears throat, sniffs) Maybe we should get out of here. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Why don't we collect your things?
Laura: Yeah, where are they? Do you know?
Taliesin: I would assume they're being stored upstairs.
Matt: "I have no idea. They're either in the vault or they're in the armory."
Sam: Vault or the armory? Those are places that we can go?
Laura: There's a vault?
Taliesin: Are there stairs in the room that we're in?
Matt: "As far as I can tell, my--"
Liam: Lady Kima, are these things absolutely necessary? We have a secret entrance to this place. We could leave now. Are they of vital importance, the things you've lost?
Matt: She thinks to herself for a second, and goes, "They are divine implements, gifted to me from an avatar of Bahamut directly. I feel, to leave them behind would be a partial failure to my quest. Not to mention, that what we may face beyond this, we'll need every bit of help we can get."
Travis: Oh, shit.
Liam: Well, that's that then.
Orion: You'll have a friend in us, that's for sure.
Laura: Let's find the frigging vault!
Taliesin: Let's go upstairs.
Liam: Let's go to the vault! Let's go upstairs.
Matt: As you show the back of that card, she gives you a look and smiles and says, "Ah. It's good to see that your scale of color does not belie your intent. That is a face I've not seen for some time. I thank you." She leaps off the table. "So." (sighs) "Shall we?"
Sam: Do you know where the vault is?
Matt: "I can show you."
Laura: (whispering) Yes!
Sam: Lead the way!
Marisha: I go up to her, still in my Minxy form, and I rub on her legs.
Taliesin: Have you dropped the body yet?
Travis: I get right up behind them too, competing for space.
Taliesin: Are you dragging a dead body around?
Marisha: No, I dropped the body. While she was talking, I took the body, and I drug it back, and I buried my shame. (all laugh)
Marisha: So, first, I buried my shame.
Matt: Your shame has been sufficiently buried. (laughter continues)
Orion: Hashtag bury your shame.
Marisha: And I purr.
Matt: She doesn't look at you, but she pats you absentmindedly as she passes you, her direct intent on heading back up those stairs herself.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves?
Laura: Yes, let's let all the other dwarves out, and maybe give them some food to try to help them out, if we can.
Travis: In the meantime, I have a greatsword or a morningstar mace that you can have until we find your items.
Matt: "Greatsword."
Travis: Greatsword it is.
Matt: She takes it from you, and the sword is a little over a foot taller than she is. Maybe a little more than that.
Laura: She's really fricking buff.
Matt: But as you hand it to her, she still takes it, and you can see--
Liam: She's a ripped halfling.
Laura: That's pretty badass.
Matt: --she is a built halfling female. She has seen some war, and she has survived some shit.
Liam: She's the Tyler Durden of halflings. (all laugh)
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Travis: As I see her grab the sword, I ask, "Would you care for some ale?" (all laugh)
Matt: She glances over her shoulder at you, and says, "Later. We have nothing to celebrate for yet."
Travis: Absolutely. Plenty of time! (all laugh)
Liam: I think Grog is smitten!
Laura: She comes to your knee.
Liam: Oh my goodness!
Laura: Can I run in the little prison, and tell the dwarves, if they are conscious, to say, "Don't exit from where you came. There's a secret entrance up and in a store room. Go that way, and stealth out."
Matt: One of the ones that was semi-conscious--
Laura: All of that, I say all of it.
Matt: He sits up and looks at-- (laughs) That's fucked up. Sits up and looks back at you and - (ragged breathing) "Thank ye. Thank ye kindly."
Laura: Here's some cheese! (all laugh)
Matt: He takes it hungrily through the bars and just starts eating it, incessantly, as you leave.
Taliesin: Government cheese.
Liam: Is provolone all you've got?
Matt: Lady Kima's already up the stairs.
Laura: It's Velveeta.
Matt: (disgusted groan) Velveeta!
Sam: We're following up the stairs.
Marisha: (laughs) It's calories!
Matt: All right. Clean this off here.
Laura: Oh goodness, oh goodness!
Taliesin: It's going to be fun! Savage burning--
Travis: I'm right with Minxy, competing for first place.
Liam: I place a hand on Lady Kima’s shoulder--
Marisha: First place, for how fucked-up we are.
Travis: Perfection! (laughs)
Marisha: Perfection! (laughs)
Liam: --place a hand on Kima's shoulder and say, "Please, allow me," and move several feet ahead of her and start sneaking along.
Matt: As you move up to her, you notice she's standing at the bottom of the stairs with a tension, staring up at the top of the stairway, where Clarota is looking down at her--
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: --and backing away, and she goes--
Orion: Oh! Yes. Uh--
Laura: Wait- Wait!
Matt: "Who is this filthy--"
Taliesin: No no no no!
Marisha: (screams)
Orion: I put my Mage Hand in front of her. Wait, wa-wait! Hold on! It- it's fine! Er, this mind flayer is with us! We saved him, or he- he's our ally now; he's fine. No one needs to fight. He, uh, she's fine, he's fine. His name is Clarota.
Taliesin: He's been an enormous help.
Matt: Without taking her eyes off of Clarota--
Orion: This is Kiva-
Sam: Kima.
Orion: Kima.
Matt: She looks back over - (laughs)
Orion: We are allies, all, yes?
Matt: "Are you to tell me that you've come down here and allied yourself with an entity that is the anathema of the Mountain?"
Orion: Yes!
Travis: Uh, what was that word?
Liam: I'm right at her shoulder, so I say, "We understand he's dangerous, but he's gotten us this far."
Matt: "And for what purpose? You think they don't have plots lined out for weeks and months--"
Orion: No, no, no! Listen, listen-
Matt: "--there is no trust to be had with these creatures."
Liam: He has been shit out by these creatures. They do not want him or trust him. He is an outcast. And we are working together, in this moment, and without him we would not have gotten here.
Laura: We see a single tear drop from Clarota's eye.
Matt: "And with him you will never get out."
Orion: No! We have his, er, alliance. There's a greater entity controlling his people, which he has been outcast from, like Vax was saying!
Matt: "And have you not thought for a second that perhaps all of you are being manipulated by this creature?"
Ashley: Well, I have.
Matt: You can see the greatsword now flares with divine energy and she goes, "I will not stand here and let us ally ourselves with this filth!"
Orion: (shouting) "Lady Kima!" And I blow fire breath. And I use Control Flames to create a bunch of swords around me with fire.
Laura: Don't threaten Kima! She's better.
Orion: (harshly) I give you my word.
Matt: Her attention divided from Clarota, now tends towards you.
Orion: Don't act me a fool, and don't treat me like one either! None of us are half-wits as you are claiming. We would not be fooled by such a creature like this. The words he speaks are true. And we believe him.
Matt: You go ahead and make a diplomacy check. Or a persuasion. Persuasion check.
Laura: Oh god!
Liam: Get it on, Tiberius!
Travis: Do it.
Liam: Get. It. On.
Orion: That's terrible.
Liam: Oh. Get it off?
Sam: Not good.
Laura: Not good?
Sam: Not good!
Orion: 12.
Matt: 12. Okay. She walks towards you, and with each step, you can see the color of her eyes begins to vanish, giving way to an extremely bright, burning, silver light. And she says--
Laura: (whispering) Oh my god, she's so cool!
Matt: "Listen. You come with me. Without this creature! Or you continue with it, and without me."
Orion: Why you have to be like that?
Matt: "I will not walk beside this. I have had its people devour mine since I set foot in here. This creature, whatever its reasoning is, is not in your best interest. It will lead you into a web of your own destruction! I've seen their kind work."
Liam: Clarota!
Orion: Yeah, they're mostly buttholes, but he's not a butthole! (all laugh)
Orion: I understand that -
Liam: Clarota!
Orion: - we had to kill a couple and he actually helped a lot!
Liam: Speak your mind! Convince her. Fix this.
Matt: Clarota, at the top of the stairs, you can see his tendrils in his mouth curl back in a sneer, his hands crossed before--
Orion: He won't even do anything!
Matt: --Clarota says, (gasping, breathy voice) "Listen. I am not going to walk where I am not welcome. I will not wake up with this--"
Liam: Giving us a Walking Dead decision.
Matt: "--woman's blade in my back! We made a deal."
Marisha: People with kids. You deal with this all the time.
Liam: I walk between them and put hands out.
Laura: Come on, roll a 20!
Liam: And say, "We all want the same thing. Kima. Tell us. What is it that you've come here for? What is your purpose here? Speak your mind, if you are true."
Matt: Kima turns back towards you, the same glowing flare in her eyes. "I've come here to rid this mountain and this continent of the darkness that resides deep within the bowels of this thing's city!"
Liam: Clarota, why have you come here. What is it you seek?
Matt: Clarota settles into itself for a second. "Ah, I've come to destroy this creature K'Varn and free my people."
Liam: Then the two of you. Get over your fucking shit. (all laugh)
Liam: We want the same thing here. Get over yourselves. Both of you. We share a common purpose. We are going to end this fucking bullshit. Kima, we have come here for you. Pay us the respect that we have earned. We have come a long way for you. He is an unlikely ally, but he has gotten us to this point. And together, for this moment and this moment only, we can work together. We don't have to be school chums or buddies in a week from now. But right now, right here, we will work together and achieve the same thing. What say you, Kima?
Matt: She looks towards you and says, "Free his people, he says. What do you think will happen once his people are free? Shall they let us walk out on our own?"
Orion: Yes! He said so! And then they'll be buttholes when we leave!
Matt: "You know so very little of these dark caverns, my dragon friend."
Orion: Yeah, it's our first time here!
Matt: "These entities I watched steal the very life essence of the men and women I hired and travelled with for weeks down here. I watched them capture them, and devour their very minds before me, and laugh and cackle as I fled into the shadows."
Laura: But they were under control of K'Varn at that point. Yeah!
Matt: "Oh! Understand; whether or not K'Varn controls them to give them direction, they are of that type of mindset at all points. They do not hope society will thrive. They do not want us free peoples to walk the surface. They want us for food."
Sam: Lady Kima, if I may. If you're intending us to choose between you, and our ally Clarota, and we can't get you to see eye to eye with us, then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but to choose our own friend Clarota over you.
Laura: (gasps) What?
Sam: We're giving you one last chance. Either you are with us, or you are against us. This is a threat.
Matt: "So you walk in here, save me from my binds, under the words of my dear, lifelong friend Arcanist Allura--"
Sam: We mean you no ill will. It is you who are aggravating the situation.
Liam: You could be sitting in a cell by yourself doing fuck-all, or ending this problem now.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Everyone's giving her inspirational talks.
Laura: I'm so nervous! Oh, Scanlan, come on!
Sam: Well, I rolled a 3...
Liam: I rolled a 13.
Sam: But I have a plus 13! So that's a 16.
Liam: Plus 13? 3 plus 13? Okay.
Ashley: Plus, plus, uh... hold on. (all laugh)
Ashley: Because, you didn't- where the fuck. (all laugh)
Ashley: War God's Blessing!
Matt: Cleric flail!
Ashley: No, I can't do that, because that's when a person makes an attack roll. (all laugh)
Ashley: Get 'em, Scanlan! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Can I assist?
Laura: He assisted because he was talking--
Matt: Unfortunately, it's too late. Once the roll--
Sam: No, he was with me, he was with me.
Laura: He assisted?
Matt: Right, right. And because of that, the DC has been considered. She takes a moment and steps forward. She's a few inches taller than you.
Sam: Of course she is! Everyone is! (all laugh)
Matt: And she looks at you, and says, "He of the pretty voice. I am grateful that all of you have come and traversed all this danger in my name, to free me from the binds that have held me. And I do wish, very much, to walk alongside you to this end. And I understand, it may be very well possible that this thing has taken your minds without your knowledge. However--" And her eyes close for a second, and she opens them again, and that radiant spark of silver fades, and her normal eye color returns. "We see ourselves with little choices. And I have very little allies at this point to achieve my goal."
Laura: (whispering) Oh, thank god.
Matt: "If we are to travel together, this one must walk in step the entire time. One single misstep, and I will not hesitate to carve that head from your body in the name of Bahamut."
Orion: I'm sorry. Do you mean like dancing?
Travis: I will help you do that if he missteps.
Matt: Clarota, hands still crossed, takes a step down the stairs towards her. Its tendrils in its mouth kind of-- (slurping SFX) (breathy voice) "And please, understand, if you ever intend to try and cut my life short, I will also not hesitate to bore that beautiful mind from your skull."
Liam: Once we murder this K'Varn, you guys are going to laugh so hard.
Laura: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Sam: So friends then?
Orion: Allies, allies.
Travis: Allies, allies.
Laura: Allies?
Taliesin: I suppose everybody understands everyone now.
Orion: Allies. Clarota likes allies.
Laura: Good times.
Liam: The enemy of my enemy...
Orion: Is...
Laura: Is my...
Sam: Has mind-sucking tentacles.
Matt: She looks back at the rest of you and gives you all an understanding look and a nod and she says, "I pray that you are right. I pray that you're honest and I pray that through some strange will of the gods, this entity is telling the truth. Because if it's not, none of us will make it out of here alive."
Liam: We're playing a game of chess here, Kima, and we will win.
Laura: I whisper in her ear "I would have chosen you."
Sam: And I start humming 'Kumbaya'. (all laughing)
Sam: Kumbaya, my lord. Kumbaya.
Orion: I take the dagger and make a happy face of fire.
Matt: She doesn't notice this, as she steps up the stairs towards Clarota.
Laura: Oh god. Okay.
Matt: Clarota steps back, hands up in front, this little spark of arcane energy forming in his hands. Clarota [sic], bringing the sword up in front of her, pushes Clarota aside and continues ascending back up the stairs to the first level. (offscreen thump)
Matt: --To the first level. (all laugh)
Orion: Killing two guards on the way.
Matt: Clarota puts the hands folded back together. (unimpressed huff) (breathy voice) "Shall we?" And walks up the stairs after her. And you all begin to ascend back onto the first floor and that’s where we’ll end the game for this evening. (Multiple groans and exclamations)
Marisha: What? No. What time is it? I thought we just got started?
Travis: I thought we were going to have to pick. We got like ten more minutes!
Marisha: Yeah, we have ten more minutes.
Sam: No, no, no. That's fine, that's fine.
Laura: No, yeah, that is a good place, or we're going to get in a battle.
Matt: (chuckles) Depending on where you guys are going next it could be a bit of a lengthy encounter, so...
Laura: Oh god.
Liam: So the building is empty.
Matt: It's totally empty.
Laura: Completely empty.
Liam: There's ghouls everywhere.
Matt: There’s nobody in there. No one has any idea that you're here.
Travis: Wait, show of hands, if we have to pick between one or the other, who's picking Kima?
Orion: Oh, Kima?
Travis: Who's picking turtle-face?
Liam: I don't know.
Orion: She's Allura's friend, right?
Travis: We're going to throw down, this is gonna be Marvel versus DC in this bitch.
Laura: She's Allura's friend, she's good!
Liam: Undecided, I don't know.
Laura: Would you pick Kima?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Okay, yeah.
Sam: You just want her because she's badass and you could hump her.
Travis: Yeah! (all laugh)
Matt: Oh, Grog.
Laura: That would be the most awkward humping ever.
Orion: That's a good idea. Grog! You can go hump, I can get Allura.
Liam: She can hump your leg.
Travis: Did you see her work in that room of blood?
Taliesin: Only one of them is demanding that I become a liar.
Marisha: Isn't Kima a dwarf?
Matt: No, Kima is a halfling.
Laura: Kima is a halfling.
Marisha: Halfling?
Liam: She's a ropy, muscular, halfling.
Ashley: Wait, dang it! I wanted to take some torture weapons!
Matt: You can go back if you want to.
Ashley: Yeah, can I go back since we have ten minutes and go get some torture weapons?
Liam: What's it for?! (all laugh)
Matt: This would be pretty quick, you have to grab some things as everyone is heading up the stairs.
Liam: Who's your deity? Harvey Keitel? (More laughing)
Ashley: No! Just for Grog!
Matt: So, Pike, the war priest, however, who the light of Sarenrae has guided her through her life, once a gifted being of light and joy, upon coming to the edge of death, her soul taken from her form and returned, going at sea and traveling with some of the more rough and tumble folks of the landscape, has returned now with her mind bent on war, vengeance--
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: --and what it means to win a battle, through force if necessary. Watching Pike rush off and going to gather up what appear to be two large, bladed hooks--
Ashley: (hissing)
Matt: .--a lengthy hand-razor--
Taliesin: Nice.
Ashley: Okay, wait, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor...
Marisha: You're going to go Sweeney Todd all up in this shit.
Laura: (mimicking Ashley) Hold on, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor. (More laughter)
Liam: A Milli Vanilli album, and...
Ashley: Wait, what was the first one?
Matt: Two large, pointed hooks that are about two feet in length. Almost like a bladed jai alai.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: And you gather a small bag of various instruments that are rusty and nasty.
Laura: Ew.
Matt: There is just some leather pouch and you put that in your bag. It's all you have time to grab before you have to bolt back up to get to the rest.
Taliesin: (swishing SFX)
Matt: And we'll pick up the next game as you guys head up the stairs back into the hallway you first entered in the center of the Emberhold duergar stronghold, Lady Kima released and a very tentative alliance. So, thank you guys all for watching.
Ashley: Whoo!
Marisha: Pain in the ass, Lady Kima. Pain in my ass.
Laura: Hey.
Zac: Oh hey.
Matt: Hello, Zac!
Zac: I was doing my little pop-ins here.
Matt: Yeah.
Zac: So we had some donations to the charity.
Matt: Oh, that's awesome!
Laura: Really?
Marisha: Yeah!
Marisha: Thanks guys.
Zac: I have really terrible handwriting, so... So I wrote these myself and I'm supposed to read them and...
Matt: Right, right, that's okay.
Zac: TheConman93.
Matt: Conman93, thank you!
Zac: ...Marilyn?
Matt: Marilyn, thank you!

And we are going to throw that dropcam up and set up for dancing. If any of you want to stay, you're welcome to. If not, you're welcome to leave. No one is going to force you, except chatroom now that I brought it up. (all laugh)
Ashley: I mean, it's a good workout after all this food.
Zac: You burn some calories after all that chicken, right?
Ashley: Burn some calories...
Laura: Right, right.
Matt: Exactly.
Zac: We are, I think, 20 away from a giveaway. So as long as we're live, the giveaway counts.
Travis: Is valid.
Matt: Exactly.
Zac: So, if you get 20 subs before we go offline we will ship this wherever you are in the world. So, let's throw the dropcam up!
Matt: Yeah guys, thank you so much! (kiss)

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone and welcome to Critical Role an online show on Twitch where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm the Dungeon Master. For returning fans, welcome, and for new folks, prepare. A couple of fun things to announce: first things first, unfortunately we are down a Percy this evening. Our buddy Taliesin picked up a con plague in Alaska this past weekend. He had a great time, but came back very ill and has been trying to get better, and is unable to make the game tonight. Which makes the current storyline a little interesting, but we'll work it out. It's fine. No Mercy Percy is going to have some business he's attending to. Thank the Critters for that. That's an awesome hashtag! So Taliesin, I hope you feel better. We miss you. Next week we continue that arc. Let's see, first and foremost, still every 100 subs we get on the channel we have a giveaway to someone who's active in the chatroom. The winner of that giveaway gets a signed picture of the cast of Critical Role, as well as a signed poster by our amazing artist Kit Buss, who was with us for our last session. Those are both given away to whoever wins that, so keep those subs going. Also, there is currently going around a hashtag: No Shave 'Til 10k. A number of people on the stream are a part of that. All sexes can compete and be a part of this, too. No Shave 'Til 10k. If you want to be a part of that, go ahead and tweet that out. Get that hashtag going and I'll see if I can convince Marisha to let me do that. We'll see. At the very least, for my Halloween costume. All right, so other cool things to talk about: all of tonight's donations are going towards the Extra Life charity. The Extra Life charity is a drive that's part of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. A lot of great people in the community have been supporting this and we're supporting that tonight. So any donations tonight will go to Extra Life. Also over the next two days, we will also be streaming here at Geek and Sundry doing a lot of other charity events for the Extra Life charity drive, including a small DND game-- some of us-- on Saturday evening with the Vox Moronica crew. So that should be fun. Come check that out! Oh, Dungeons and Dragons, the official Wizards of the Coast folks are also doing their Extra Life stream over the next 48 hours. They're just going to be doing live DND streams as well. So starting tomorrow at noon through Sunday at noon, just constant DND on the Wizards of the Coast stream as well. And all of that is going to be raising money for Extra Life. So you'll have a lot of things to keep you busy this weekend essentially. So there's that. Also, we have New York Comic Con coming up in just a couple of weeks. Excited about that, for all you guys. We have panels on Saturday. Do we have times for those yet?
Liam: Between 1 00 and 4 00 is when we're doing stuff.
Matt: Yeah, between 1 00 and 4 00. We have about an hour panel in there somewhere and then probably two hours of signings at the event on Saturday. So 1:00 and 4:00! Leave that period of time open. Hang out.
Marisha: We'll have prints!
Matt: Exactly! And then on Sunday, outside of the convention, because we know a lot of the badges were snatched up before this announcement even happened and a lot of the Critters aren't able to make it to the actual con. On Sunday, we're looking around midday. We don't have a time or location determined yet, but that will be up on Twitter soon. It's going to happen. We're going to have an offsite Critter meetup. Where we're going to all be able to be there, hang out with you guys and catch up, sign stuff, say hi, and have a good time. So watch Twitter. If you don't follow us on Twitter, do it, because we'll have those announcements coming up very soon. So excited about that. Liam, you wanted to announce--
Liam: Yes! This is the final chance for y'all to jump on Joe Madureira's Kickstarter, Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They have absolutely killed their Kickstarter. They hit their goal, their initial goal about two or three days in, and they have been hitting every single stretch goal they've had. They've got one last mystery stretch goal left to hit. So it's a good time to get in and just get them to the very tippy, tippy top of their campaign, which is about to end. If you guys don't know, really quick, because I've been talking about it for two weeks: Joe Madureira, amazing comic book legend, has drawn everything. It looks like nobody else's and has a good history in game dev as well. Created Darksiders with his company, Vigil Games, that he helped found. And now he has founded Airship Syndicate, and they're making an RPG in the style of JRPGs that you've loved in your lives. But also with Joe's ridonkulous art style. So go get on it.
Matt: Yeah! Thank you, Liam. Orion, you wanted to say something real fast as well.
Orion: Yes. Greetings and salutations, everyone! Last week when Kit was here-- Hi Kit, we miss you! We went to It's a Wrap over in Burbank, California. Me and Liam and Laura and Marisha and Kit and her hubby. We were there and saw this robe, and I think Marisha and Laura were like, try it on, and I was like, okay. And I tried it on and was like, oh my god, it was made for me.
Matt: The Tiberius robe you always knew-- or didn't know you wanted.
Orion: Yeah, totally, I was like, oh my god, and Liam tweeted a picture about it, and then I was streaming on my stream on Twitch and somebody mentioned the robe. And Michael Bauman-- thank you again, I'm going to thank you on Critical Role for-- he donated $400, which was the cost of the robe, and then he just wrote in the chat, this is for the robe, so I'm wearing the robe.
Laura: That's awesome!
Orion: Thank you very much. Thank you so much you guys and all you guys who pitched in and stuff. Thank you.
Matt: We'll find many cool excuses to have that robe be displayed and utilized in many ways. I'm pretty sure he hasn't taken it off since he got it.
Laura: Yeah, it smells really bad, you guys.
Matt: Awesome! Anybody else have any other announcements before we get this party started?
Travis: I like cheese.
Matt: Travis likes cheese, ladies and gentlemen.
Laura: That's a good announcement.
Matt: I think so. It was very informative. Thank you, Travis. All right, then. Without further ado, let's go ahead and cut to the intro and then we'll jump right into the next episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back! So picking up after the events of last week, to give you guys a little bit of a refresher. After the party had returned from their journey into Vasselheim for quite a few weeks, they discovered upon returning that the illustrious Briarwoods, current owners of Castle Whitestone and overseers of the entire city of Whitestone and sticking point in Percy's background, were coming to Emon to meet for essentially a political banquet with Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei to discuss construction of a bridge. It was a very political endeavor. And the council of Tal'Dorei was invited, including Vox Machina. There was a week of preparation in going into this event to see exactly what the Briarwoods were about. Information was gathered at this banquet. Vax went on his own little adventure into the Briarwoods' room, in which they nearly killed him. (chuckles)
Liam: Hey, everybody!
Matt: I didn't notice the shirt until now. So yeah, the party rushed out to his aid. Much violence ensued. The Briarwoods eventually escaped through some sort of magical means that was not uncovered. However, they are no longer in the picture. The party was left with a destroyed carriage, a young carriage driver who had his hand shot off by Percy, and was then told to the guards to haul off and bring to their keep to throw into their cell for further questioning. Uriel was eventually drawn out and confused by the sudden chaos and vehemently requested that Vox Machina return the next morning to go over what has transpired. After which, the party during this event had encountered a tiefling by the name of Lillith, who was masquerading as one of the servants within the palace of Tal'Dorei. Aided them in the battle and revealed that she was being hunted by her sisters in a distant land and revealing herself here essentially opened up her physical presence to be pinpointed and then immediately sought and hunted by whoever was after her. The party then brought her back to the keep. They were on the way back before they were encountered by this bounty hunter and a small team of individuals that were coming with him to seek down, capture Lillith, and bring her back to her sisters. The party then defended her in this circumstance, brutally murdering one of them. Sorry, brutally murdering two of them. One of which was then raised and sent off as a present to the sisters by Lillith. One was salvaged, not given an honorable death, and sent to find his way somewhere northwest of Emon. Possibly towards Vasselheim or wherever else he may find his adventure. They then gave Lillith the opportunity to come stay the night to rest in the keep and they all made their way back to Greyskull Keep for the evening. And that was where we left off. So as the evening progresses you all manage to get your rest and gather your thoughts over the rather stressful experience you had the previous evening within the palace. The next morning comes around. You all come to consciousness. Breakfast is prepared by the servants of the keep. As you all wake up, start getting your meals and gathering what you want to do for the day, two individuals have not come down for their meal. Lillith and Percy.
Orion: Good morning, everyone!
Sam: Not everyone. We're missing two. A male and a female.
Laura: Oh. No.
Travis: You don't think?
Laura: Percy was upset.
Sam: Maybe he needed some comforting.
Orion: Oh, I see. Are you saying they're having relations?
Sam: I'm not saying that.
Laura: Perhaps we should check on them?
Travis: We should totally check on them!
Sam: Okay, but if there's a sock or a gun on the doorknob, don't go in.
Laura: Or a ribbon. She wore a ribbon.
Orion: Well, I was thinking last night, Grog, that we're probably going to be here for a little bit before going anywhere. Do we go anywhere?
Laura: We have to go see Uriel.
Orion: Who? Oh. Right! Yes! Also, I really want to see Allura. For no particular-- actually for very specific reasons. Yes.
Travis: I think he's lying.
Orion: One of them is  I want to pick up one of the Earrings of Telecommunication. It has been finished for quite some time. We just have to go to where she resides to pick it up. Then one of us could have another one.
Liam: That robe just takes it to a whole new level!
Laura: Yeah, it really does.
Orion: I feel so good.
Liam: I'm somewhat entranced.
Orion: I'm telling you, it's helping, too.
Travis: Do I feel a little tingle from my belt? And can I roll for a beard check?
Sam: Oh, beard check?
Travis: Six. Two.
Matt: You wake up, realizing that the morning has transpired. You reach up and grab. And what you guys notice as he comes up is there is a dark charcoal smear across one side of his face where facial hair would once be, to match the other side that is currently beautiful quaff and shining in the dapples of morning light that come through the keep window.
Travis: You know the remedy for it, you just turn your face in the looking glass.
Laura: Yeah, from this angle you look amazing Grog.
Travis: My god, I'm so handsome. Right? And then just horror. Sheer horror.
Orion: (poof) A little dust and fix that for him.
Laura: Oh, so it looks normal again? I like it! Yeah. Beautiful. Don't touch it.
Matt: The color's a little off, but it looks better than not having it.
Marisha: In my head you're like those Mr. Wooly magnetic toys when you're a kid.
Travis: I would shave it and get it even, but let's be honest, given history, it's going to take care of itself soon enough. These things don't live very long.
Laura: I'm going to go upstairs and see if our guest, Lillith, is all right. I don't want to disturb Percy just yet.
Matt: All right. You head to the guest room. You have one guest room upstairs that was among the rest of the rooms that you guys had constructed.
Travis: (singing) They're going to be getting it on!
Matt: You knock on the door. A moment passes. No response.
Laura: Lillith? Are you with Percy? Lillith?
Matt: You knock a second time and the door (creaks) opens a little bit. It has not really been locked or closed.
Laura: I peek my head in.
Matt: You peek in and look.
Travis: Did you check for traps?
Matt: Roll a-- no, I'm kidding. (laughter)
Laura: Damn it!
Matt: Already off! No. As you peek into the room, the lights are dimmed. What little bit of candles are in there are already down. Glancing in, the sheets are clean and set, the bed's been made, and there is a small piece of parchment that is folded on the edge of the bed.
Laura: Go and read it.
Matt: Read it? It reads, "Vox Machina, thank you all for your hospitality and protection through this past evening. I would stay, but the longer I remain, the more danger I am in, and as such, put all of you in as well. I shall travel across the Ozmit Sea to seek the guidance of my cousin Zahra, in hopes of finally getting out from under my sisters' baneful gaze. Nevertheless, I wish you all the finest of journeys, and I hope we meet again soon. Lillith."
Laura: She's so cute.
Marisha: I liked her bow. It was cute.
Laura: I tell everyone that she's gone. Gone.
Travis: No, she's in Percy's room! Scanlan, let's go see if he's banging!
Sam: All right, let's go! (laughter)
Matt: You run up and Percy's room is-- the door is already partially ajar.
Travis: (boom)
Matt: It bursts open. (wham) Slams on the side of the door, looking in the room. He's not there, is the first thing you notice. However, what you do see are a series of different books of sketches and designs and half-concocted blueprints for different things are crumpled and torn across the room. The bedsheets are thrown off the bed. It looks like the room has been continuously tossed through some sort of frenzied action, either seeking something or just out of emotional frustration. This room is left in far more disarray than you're used to seeing true to Percy's character.
Sam: My god, Grog. Percy's a hoarder.
Travis: Right.
Sam: Or he's in serious distress.
Travis: I think it's the previous.
Sam: The hoarder?
Travis: Yeah. Probably.
Sam: We must find him, don't you think? Our friend's in trouble. I proceed down to his tinkering lab. Doesn't he have some sort of lab downstairs?
Travis: My room's like shit, and I'm not in trouble.
Sam: Well, that goes with your character.
Matt: Yeah. You head down to the basement area, and to the right is the cell, to the left is the workshop. The workshop door is currently closed. There is a small slider eye vent where you can peek through.
Sam: Can I reach the eye vent?
Matt: You can if you leap hard enough and catch it on the edge.
Travis: I boost him up.
Matt: Okay. Looking inside, you can see, the forge is aglow. You hear the tangs of metal being hammered against the anvil, and you can see the form of Percy framed against the backlighting of the forge. He's feverishly working away on some sort of project.
Travis: Is he naked?
Sam: No, he's working too hard. Maybe we should just leave him be. Seems focused, driven, like a madman.
Travis: Oh. I get it. Like a madman?
Sam: I don't think you do.
Matt: At which point a voice rings out from across the room: Percy unmoving, still continuing his work, shouts over his shoulder, "Please, leave me be. I have a lot to think about right now."
Sam: Would you like a meal brought down?
Matt: "I'm fine. Thank you. Really. I need some time."
Sam: All right. If you're making things, a little ladder for the little perch here might be nice. Just in the future! But not now. That seems low priority.
Matt: He stops his banging, walks over and scribbles something on a paper, then goes back to banging. "Noted." (clanging)
Travis: I drop Scanlan and I lean in and I go, beware the water! It burns!
Matt: "Yes. Yes, it does, Grog. Good boy."
Sam: All right. So we go back up. Tell the fellows, Percy's in a mood. He's creating right now. I think we should just leave him be.
Laura: Understandable.
Liam: Let him get it out of his system.
Marisha: I'm really worried about him.
Sam: Yes.
Orion: Matthew? Rolling-- 12. I'm just trying to teach my pet something but I rolled a 12.
Matt: For?
Orion: Oh, I want it to follow. To follow.
Matt: To follow. Okay. You gather, based on the recent intensity of trying to teach things to Lockheed over the past week. You succeed in a few. There is a bit of balking frustration that perhaps you've overstepped a little bit, and Lockheed feels maybe there's less of a friendship here more than a real master-servant relationship, at least in this moment, and does not seem to be receptive to your attempt.
Orion: He's in a mood, also. Why is everybody in a mood today?
Sam: I know. Percy's hate-smelting downstairs.
Laura: Percy has good reason to hate-smelt. He seems rather disturbed that the Briarwoods got away.
Sam: Yes. I feel responsible.
Marisha: Out of curiosity, did anyone else hear him-- did anyone else just happen to hear what he said in that fight last night?
Laura: I was a little bit preoccupied by watching him shoot a servant boy over and over and over again.
Marisha: It was after that, actually.
Laura: What did he say?
Marisha: Never mind.
Sam: What? No, spit it out. What did he say? It seems important.
Marisha: It's hard to say. You know Percy. I don't know where he gets these lines.
Sam: Is it fuck? Is it shit?
Travis: Cock! Bulls! Dong! Wang!
Liam: Steampunk!
Marisha: Jeez. Okay.
Travis: Donkey wang!
Marisha: This is getting really off subject.
Orion: I'm going to go down to my laboratory.
Laura: What did he say?
Marisha: It was when he was screaming the cluster of things as he was shooting that mercenary in the face, and he said, "What are you doing? You have no reason to be here. Your soul is now forfeit." Really, that last part is the most important one. The first stuff is fairly average. But yeah, "Your soul is now forfeit."
Travis: It's a good line.
Laura: It's a really good line.
Sam: Thought he was just trash-talking. You think there's more to it?
Marisha: I thought it was maybe a line and then it seemed really aggressive and strong and specific, so it made me think a lot. I don't know.
Laura: Did you ask him about it at all?
Marisha: We haven't seen him since that happened.
Travis: What do you think?
Laura: What, do you think his Pepperbox is-- what?
Marisha: I think he's not telling us everything, that's for sure.
Sam: Well, we all have some secrets.
Marisha: Yeah. But screaming, "Your soul is now forfeit?" That's not a secret. That's saying you peed the bed when you were a kid.
Liam: I worry, too, but he did lose his entire family.
Laura: He did pee the bed when he was a kid.
Marisha: Oh, really?
Liam: I am assuming. But he lost his entire family to those people.
Marisha: Sure. But he wasn't screaming this at the Briarwoods. He was screaming this at a random mercenary.
Laura: Well?
Marisha: What does that mean?
Travis: Maybe his soul is forfeit.
Marisha: To what?
Travis: Death?
Laura: Maybe we keep an eye on Percy.
Sam: That's a fair point, though. We'll keep an eye on him. He seems to be in a fragile state right now.
Laura: Percy's not the one who killed a poor old woman, though.
Sam: Did we kill her? I thought we just made her sleep and then walked away.
Travis: Nope. No. Total massacre.
Laura: Tiberius destroyed her.
Sam: Tiberius, you killed an old woman?
Orion: I'm not there.
Marisha: Yeah, that's actually another thing I wanted to talk about. That was also really intense. You know, I get it. It was a hard day. It was a hard day, and we tend to get a little aggressive sometimes after hard days. We've all been there. But he didn't just murder an old woman. He chainsawed her. A sleeping, unconscious woman.
Travis: It was pretty great!
Sam: Are you saying that we should take it down a notch? Or maybe not brutally destroy the bad guys?
Marisha: You also were the only other one who seemed to be confused as to what was going on.
Laura: I shot her. I shot her in the back. Let's be honest. I didn't chainsaw her, but I did shoot her in the back as she was running away.
Sam: I made her go to sleep. That was peaceful.
Marisha: That's what I'm saying. That was good. That was nice.
Laura: I was aiming for her shoulder, if it makes any difference.
Travis: She did have that sweet little run, which was so cute.
Sam: Are you taking moral exception to some of our behavior?
Marisha: That might exactly be what I'm saying. Man, you see this is why I like you, Scanlan. You're so much better at the words than me. I don't think I even knew that's what I felt until you said it just now.
Sam: Well, this is something perhaps you should pray on and think on. If there's something you'd like us to change about our behavior, we can consider that. We're all friends. We're allies here. We should pay respect to you.
Marisha: I just don't want us to--
Liam: It's a fair point. We don't want to be corrupted by the very evil that we mean to stamp out in this world. She was trying to kill us. But your point is taken.
Marisha: She was a really old woman.
Liam: But she wasn't the secretary. She was trying to kill.
Marisha: Sure. But she was unconscious.
Travis: She actually didn't do anything, either.
Marisha: Yeah, she didn't really do anything at all.
Travis: She could have been taking notes.
Laura: She had a wand!
Marisha: I'm not saying she wasn't a threat and I'm not saying we shouldn't handle threats. I'm saying maybe we shouldn't dissect a woman with a spinning Krull blade who's sleeping on the ground. Defenseless, running away. She was fleeing.
Sam: All right. You know, this is constructive criticism, and we'll take it as such. And I, for one, will maybe not desecrate and denigrate bodies.
Laura: Just beds! And temples. (laughs)
Liam: I don't know! I mean, I see what Keyleth's saying, but I don't really want to cramp your style, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, I'll shit on things. Maybe not people.
Liam: We're like the A-Team, and that's your specialty. I don't really want to-- See, you should just shit when you feel the urge.
Laura: What time is it? Do we need to be getting to Uriel?
Travis: Oh yeah, what time is it?
Matt: At this point, it's probably pushing on 11 am, close to noon.
Laura: We should probably be getting to the palace.
Matt: Tiberius, what did you say you were doing down there? What did you say you were doing down in your laboratory?
Orion: Well, I was doing my research on that stuff last night and this morning.
Matt: Your which one?
Orion: It's just my ability because of my class. I do the backstory.
Matt: Your backstory is?
Orion: I am a noble sage.
Matt: Well, there's a noble and there's a sage.
Orion: Yeah, I know, and I spliced them because it made sense. No. The noble part is the RP. The sage is the perk.
Matt: Okay. Gotcha. That's good to know. All right.
Orion: And I was writing down the sigil to the keep. That's completed.
Matt: Okay. So the sigil is there for you. All right. And so as the sage-- All right. Okay. So yeah. Not difficult to research. There are a number of books. They're older books and things that were installed as part of the construction of this laboratory for you, and information that you have gathered since. There are various bestiaries and gatherings of information about the dangerous denizens in the countryside around you, and it is a very dangerous place outside of the few points of civilized society that has built up its own defenses. Throughout the evening and the morning, you've managed to find eventually a piece that talks about various undead entities and the process of undeath, and necromantic magics that have been perverted throughout the generations to defy the natural cycle of life. You do come across an entry about vampirism. It is extremely rare and was largely thought abolished close to 200 years ago. There are very rare whispers of any sort of cases out there, and usually as soon as something comes to any sort of public knowledge, large mobs gather and whoever was infected with this horrible state was hunted down and killed. What you do learn from this is religious symbology, while classically thought to have an effect on people afflicted with vampirism, actually has no effect. It's more of a superstition, but does not actually have any negative impact on the individual. However, certain things that do render a vampire easier to destroy: the presence of sunlight. Anything that counts as sunlight can damage them progressively the longer they're in it, prevent them from restoring their health, and ultimately destroy them and turn them to ash, should they be brought to the brink of death in the presence of sunlight. Also, very quickly and consistently rushing water. Being held into a rushing stream or under a waterfall would have a similar effect to sunlight. You do also know the stake in the heart is also considered to be a way to destroy them. It does not actually destroy them, but it does render them paralyzed and has to be done when they're in their resting place, within their coffin and/or the dirt that is considered their resting location. Usually that is the beginning step: to find and locate where the vampire is resting, stake in the heart, and then carry the body to sunlight or rushing water. And that's how they're permanently destroyed. You also find out that if a vampire is thought to be killed under any other circumstances, the body turns to mist and is nigh invulnerable and eventually finds its way back to wherever they've hidden their resting place to recover within a very short period of time, making them extremely dangerous, unless you have the right situation, the right conditions, to bring them to that point. So that information is now at your disposal.
Orion: Wonderful.
Travis: Do you want to tell us what you've learned?
Orion: I did it right this time! Knowing that, I take some files and-- I want to check if I can-- Nope. I can't do anything yet. That's it. I'm going to go upstairs.
Matt: Okay. So as you guys have gathered the time and what you might be, going forward, doing for the rest of the day, Tiberius comes upstairs with a bit of a smile and an air of confidence.
Laura: Oh good, you're back.
Liam: Tibs, we were just discussing the future of the group and the direction we've been taking. And a point was introduced that maybe perhaps, we started as a sort of a-- mercenary group is a bit strong-- but this alliance we have formed out of convenience. We all needed to eat. But now that we're at the stature we are, in a keep, in Emon. Friends to the emperor. We want to figure out what we're doing here. Do we want to be just powerful badasses who walk around getting what they want, or are we trying to enact some positive change in this world?
Orion: Yes, absolutely. That's what my items are for. I've only found one of them. There are still three or four, if they even exist out there. There are countless things to go and venture forth and explore.
Travis: What? Your items?
Orion: The artifacts, the Ring of Boros, the old hag. That is the next step in my quest. She told us it would be in the Feywood. Right?
Matt: Feywild. Close. Researcher.
Orion: That is where we need to go. But that's why we ran into her in Vasselheim, and she wouldn't tell me anything more.
Marisha: How do you plan to use your items? For better good in the world?
Orion: Well, you've seen how I've used my Mending Wheel. Countless ways.
Travis: Yeah, thank you. You healed my cask. I'll always be grateful.
Orion: Moreover, it would prove to the council that all of the things that I went on this journey for to begin with, it was true. Or for naught. And really, to gain the respect of my father and everyone else. You don't know how hard it is to be a chromatic dragon in a metallic world! It's not easy.
Liam: Well, there's no question that you are an invaluable member of Vox Machina, and our friend, and our family. And that is not in question.
Orion: Of course. Which is why I have pledged my loyalty to you all. And I need your strength, as well. There is no way I could accomplish in my mission alone. I mean, Grog, when I ran into you in that one bar. How many men were you beating up? I counted eight, if I recall.
Travis: I think that sounds right.
Sam: He can't count.
Travis: It's that many.
Orion: Here was this brute who I would have ran away from, but here you were, and I found you to be rather charming. I figured, well, that's some good company to keep, rather. And then I met the rest of you, and look where we are now!
Laura: Yes. Tiberius, the point of this is you killed an old woman last night, very brutally. Please maybe don't do that again.
Orion: She felt nothing, but of course. And I was giving my new Krull blade a good old try.
Laura: Yes, you were. Maybe not on sleeping people anymore. People who are actually attacking us.
Orion: She was-- okay, fine.
Liam: Well, I think the point is your abilities in arcane wonder are expanding daily. Exponentially. And perhaps be a little tentative. Do a little practice run in the woods on your own, once in a while, and see what the effects are before you go whipping it out.
Orion: Are there woods nearby?
Sam: This is an intervention. We love you very much, but you killed an old lady.
Travis: I like the way you kill people.
Orion: Well, yes.
Laura: We're all on the up and up now, right?
Orion: One raises a hand to me or Vox Machina, they are going to die.
Travis: Yeah! Yeah, they are!
Orion: It is simple. I do not know why this is a discussion. I won't be as cruel--
Marisha: You know, she didn't even really do anything. She was really old.
Laura: She was attacking us.
Liam: Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Liam: Clearly, we all love you as family, and nobody blames you, but you once killed a child, and none of us blame you for that.
Travis: Is it too early to start drinking? I pull out the cask of ale.
Liam: And that happened in the heat of battle.
Marisha: You know, I'm really sensitive about that, Vax. I'm really sensitive about that, Vax!
Liam: I'm well aware.
Marisha: And that was different.
Laura: It was an accident!
Marisha: That was pretty fucking deliberate, what he did.
Orion: Yes, to someone who was opposing us. That was a child who was innocent. Or was he opposing us, too? I don't remember, actually.
Liam: And it all falls apart.
Marisha: He was being puppeted by sorcerer Michael Jackson.
Liam: No one agrees with you today more than I, and I think we can adjust our perspective slightly. Right, Grog?
Travis: What's the word?
Liam: See?
Sam: Kill softer.
Orion: I'll show you how. You just have to do it really slow.
Laura: Uriel's waiting for us.
Sam: Let's table this. We'll stick a pin in this discussion. We'll all be thinking long and hard about this.
Laura: Keyleth, it wasn't intentional and everybody knows that.
Liam: Absolutely. Not intentional. No.
Marisha: I turn into Minxie and start walking.
Travis: Minxie! I go and give a little scratch behind the ears.
Matt: You guys gather and make your way into the city of Emon proper.
Laura: Actually, before we head towards Uriel, we probably should-- do we have any sort of proof that the Briarwoods actually did horrible things and it wasn't us attacking them?
Liam: Well, I've got these little scars right here.
Matt: The scars are still there. They're still wounds that are healing.
Laura: All right. Cool. Just making sure that we had something.
Liam: And then there was what's-his-name, Awesome Pants, who was there.
Laura: Seeker Asum.
Orion: Allura saw everything, as well.
Sam: Did she see the fight?
Laura: Allura didn't see the fight.
Liam: We know she knows what's up, but whether she can be used as a reliable witness is-- we've got multiple witnesses.
Sam: There were those guards, too. There was guards outside the door.
Liam: They were incinerated.
Sam: Oh yeah.
Laura: Plus, they were the Briarwoods' guards, anyway.
Orion: One of them was still alive. I didn't kill both of them.
Laura: He went away with the Briarwoods, I'm going to assume.
Travis: What a dick! We go to see Uriel.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I made a choice for the team! (laughter)
Matt: As you're having this discussion, all of you make your way into the city of Emon, across the districts to the Cloudtop. You're greeted and let within the gate into the central district there. You make your way to the palace of Tal'Dorei, through the front doors. The guards that are there lead you in and one of them says, "Uriel is waiting within the throne chamber." You guys are led down the main hallway into the very center of the palace.
Marisha: I come out of Minxie.
Matt: The nervous guard, thankfully, puts his weapon away and is like, "Oh! Lady Keyleth, my apologies." And puts his spear to the side.
Laura: Trinket's still here, though.
Liam: I buzz over to that specific guard and say, do you have a lost and found here? I have this really badass serpent-style belt. Sometimes it crawls around on its own. Sometimes it's just a belt. And I lost it here the other night. And I'm really hoping-- I mean, it ties everything together. Is there anyone I can check with?
Matt: "Check back after you've spoken with the Sovereign, please. Thank you." Leads you guys on. As you head down the main hallway-- and you recall this hallway. This was a long, dangerous trek the first time you came to the palace. This was where Uriel's family was possessed. This is where you had your battle with the glabrezu. This is where Pike was slain. This is where you had to pull the shadows from the bodies of his family. This is a very emotional place that you really haven't been to since that sequence of events. Walking in already has this tenuous state of low-simmering energy. As you're brought into the main chamber, you can see there is the dual thrones for Uriel and his wife. His wife is not present; his family is not present, just Uriel sitting on the throne. There are a few guards on the different entrances to the room. As you walk in, Uriel just sits there on the throne and gives you acknowledgment and ushers you into the room. You all step in. Trinket behind you keeping an eye out. Like a bear is wont to do. You guys make your way up towards the very edge of the central raised dais where the thrones are currently set up on. You now see on the opposite side of the room, Seeker Asum and Allura walk in, as well as Arbiter Brom, who is the cleric that is the Master of Law in the city. They walk up and flank the sides of the throne, stepping back a little bit to not gather all the attention, but definitely be there as a show of support. As they enter, the doors on the other side of the room and the door behind you open, and roughly 30 guards enter the chamber quietly. They all filter in, blocking all the exits. The doors close. No weapons are drawn, but there is a very strong showing of muscle in this room that you weren't expecting for this meeting. Once all the guards are settled and a really awkward silence hits the room, Uriel stands up from the throne and looks upon you. Pacing slightly, back and forth. "Thank you all for joining me. I must say, I am troubled by recent events, and I wish to speak to you regarding them before taking any action. I owe you that much for all you've done for me. Before you left for Vasselheim, you showed immediate interest in the Briarwoods. Percy in-- Where is Percival?"
Sam: Well, he's not feeling well today after the events of last night, so he stayed behind.
Matt: "Well, then please relay this conversation to him as soon as you see him. You exhibited interest in the Briarwoods before leaving for Vasselheim. I, through trust, did not inquire as to why. But upon your return, eagerly told you they were coming to this feast and invited you as part of the Council of Tal'Dorei to join this feast, as it was your request. I graciously followed through. You showed up. A meal was had. Questions were asked, although curious ones; I did not pry. Now I have since been notified, and seen a bit of the aftermath, that you, Vox Machina, seemingly attacked our guests shortly-- please. Listen. Attacked our guests shortly after the meal in their own guest quarters. Forcing them to flee, after you destroyed the hallway, ruined their carriage, murdered two of their guards, two more outside, and leaving Seeker Asum to witness this entire process." Asum gives a nod. "You then tortured their carriage driver, requested he be sent to the dungeon beneath your keep. And upon my sentries returning from Greyskull to deliver him, they find a freshly murdered old woman not far behind the path you took. Not long after, Seeker Asum found me and corroborated most of this unexpected, violent behavior. I then asked Arbiter Brom here to divine the nature of this murder. And through his divine sight, through the goddess Ioun, comes to tell me it was none other than you, Tiberius, that slaughtered this elderly woman while she slept."
Orion: Yes!
Matt: "Now, I am quite disturbed by the events of these past 14 hours, and I would like to hear an explanation. Arbiter, if you could please, prepare the space." Arbiter Brom steps forward and pulls forth from underneath his robes a necklace that contains a holy symbol. The same symbol you saw across the temple beneath the Slayer's Take, an eye-like inscription of the god Ioun. Brom grasps it, looks about you all, and prepares this slight hand gesture, and you feel a slight tingle across the skin that lasts a few seconds.
Marisha: Can I recognize the spell he's casting?
Matt: I'll say go ahead and make a-- this would be a religion check.
Marisha: He's doing a cleric thing, yeah? Seven.
Matt: All right. Unable to ascertain the nature. However, the incantation completes. No seeming noticeable effect. Brom nods and steps back in the line of the thrones. I want all of you guys to roll charisma saving throws.
Marisha: Son of a bitch. Always a problem.
Orion: 19.
Marisha: 11.
Sam: I get advantage, and I rolled a 27.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. Bards.
Liam: 19.
Laura: 13.
Travis: 18.
Matt: All right. Good to know. Uriel then looks to the rest of you. "So. I've said my piece for the moment. Explain."
Liam: I step forward.
Marisha: Can I do a quick insight check on Asum to see if I can still recognize if he's still affected by the mind-control thing?
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check, sure.
Marisha: Ooh yeah! 28.
Matt: Glancing at Asum, the way he's looking at you and the general tension and feeling of the room, you gather that Asum is not his normal self completely. You step forward.
Liam: Uriel. With all respect, I needn't remind you what the group of people before you put themselves through on your behalf and your family's behalf. We almost lost one of our own. And if that counts for nothing here, then nothing makes sense. But if that is not enough, let us start here.
Orion: The Briarwoods are vampires. And that old lady, who was a butthole by the way, was with this demonoid person who we had to fight as well.
Liam: One thing at a time. That's true, but one thing at a time. We had prior knowledge of the Briarwoods' intentions before this evening. And I myself went to spy on them.
Laura: Here's the thing. Percy doesn't like them because they killed his family. They took over his home, after killing his family. He got away. He knows they're scary. We're trying to protect you.
Orion: So the point is, we all know how dangerous it is that the knowledge of vampire existence and the spreading of those vile creatures. And now we know they do exist. So however the means that that came about is neither here nor there. We know where they are.
Travis: And if you're wondering how we know they're vampires-- (whispering) Vax, this is your cue.
Liam: I will subject myself to any test, to any wizard or mage in this city who you know can ascertain the truth. To look through my eyes, to see my memories. I don't know shit about magic, but there are people who do.
Sam: Cleric Tristan also treated him last night for his vampire-inflicted wound. I know this all looks really bad on the surface, and we did not want to cause any disturbance within these hallowed walls, but there was a danger, we acted. Perhaps too abruptly and without telling you.
Laura: We tried to get your attention. I called for you immediately. As soon as we knew there was danger.
Liam: And don't take our word for it. Anyone, have them look in here.
Orion: Actually, you take a Stormwind's word for--
Matt: "Silence! Silence. You're in my court now, Stormwind. You put so much weight upon this trust, and you have done a good service. But also I've heard whispers that you've thrown this trust around in many circles. Remember, we held a parade in your honor; we spread the word of the good deeds you've done. We, at our own costs of Emon, built you a keep, a home, at great expense, to show thanks. And also, I believed, upon allowing you to join the council, put us square. I owe you nothing. Just as you owe me nothing."
Liam: Do you not want the truth?
Matt: "I want the truth, but I also want you to understand the stakes that are here and why there is this question. As the leader of this-- not this city, but this entire countryside, I have to be sure, and this is not the first time I have been lied to by very close, trusted people, so I have to be thorough."
Liam: This is why I offer myself completely into your control and put myself under your supervision and any user of the arcane arts you want to peer inside my mind, let them step up to the plate, because I have nothing to hide.
Laura: Also, while you are inquiring about him, you might inquire about Seeker Asum.
Sam: If you're worried about lies within your own ranks, I think you should start with him.
Marisha: In fact, I actually might be able to help Seeker Asum, if you will allow me to.
Sam: Help him?
Matt: You glance over at Asum, and Asum gives a look to Uriel and Uriel--
Laura: He was mind-controlled last night.
Matt: "I have had Asum at my side for the better part of 15 years. He is responsible, far more than your merry band has ever attempted, for keeping and maintaining the good and lawful state of this country."
Liam: Uriel, your own family was not themselves! And you know that! Look into my mind! Now! Today! You don't need to guess anything.
Matt: "It would also do you well to show respect. We are speaking, half-elf. Now, I would assign Allura to such an endeavor. However, it has also been noticed that she has grown quite friendly and attached to your group, and in this circumstance, there is question. So you will be, in a few days, assigned an individual to this ritual of which you are presenting yourself."
Marisha: Uriel, please--
Matt: "Shh. The Briarwoods, regardless of what you may think they may be, or we do-- that will show in time-- have shown nothing over the past five years but graciousness, and gone through all proper channels to establish this relationship between our city and theirs. Far more than the previous family ever attempted."
Liam: Well, one may smile and smile and still be a villain.
Matt: "That goes both ways. Now, please."
Marisha: Just let me do a quick restoration spell on Asum. If nothing is wrong with him, nothing will happen. It's harmless. It's like taking medicine when you're not sick. It can't hurt. And if I am wrong, then we can continue on. We can have Vax tested. Please, it'll take ten minutes. What can it hurt?
Laura: Up until last night, he was himself. Trust us that now he is not.
Marisha: He came to us.
Matt: "There has been nothing about his behavior, at all, to insinuate any change of anything of the sort. And I have known the man for quite some time, before I even took this throne. However, I will, in the good graces and the relationship we forged, allow this. Asum, are you all right with this?" Asum gives a nod. "Well, if this is to be how it is. Certainly." And he steps forward. The halfling approaches you, looking you in the face. All right. You would like to attempt your Greater Restoration spell?
Marisha: First, I meditate for a second, and I cast Enhance Ability on myself.
Matt: As a note, as you begin casting, you notice the guards all go for their weapons and ready themselves, uncertain of what's about to transpire. There is a tension in the room based on what this is going to be.
Marisha: Can I get some meditation music, Scanlan?
Sam: Oh! (chanting)
Matt: All right. So first you cast Enhance Ability on yourself.
Marisha: Am I maybe inspired by that?
Matt: Sure. In the tension of the room, this slow droning hum of the gnome, which you can notice some of the guards look at each other, confused. And Asum puts his hand up like, hold off.
Liam: It's Tuvan throat singing.
Matt: All right. So first you cast Enhance Ability on your--
Marisha: Self.
Sam: What ability?
Marisha: To enhance wisdom? Wisdom.
Matt: Okay. You reach out with Greater Restoration. You complete the ritual. You touch onto the arms of Asum. It fades, and you see in his eyes there's a moment of clarity and an inhale. A slight gasp, like some realization hits him and his expression changes and looks towards you and just goes-- He puts his hands out like this for a moment, just trying to almost tell you something. Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Just a d20. Or no, make an insight. Make a straight insight. This is more of an insight roll here.
Marisha: Okay. Oh! 29.
Matt: You get the sense through the subtlety of physical motion and expression, Asum is telling you, just go with me on this. He steps back into the place next to the throne. There's a brief moment of pause. Uriel says, "And, Asum?" Asum goes, "My stance has not changed. I know not what she is attempting or thought the situation was, but it appears to me that this was either misinformation or at least at the time being, hopefully, not a lie. But I believe Brom has taken care of that, yes?" And Brom gives a nod. "I certainly have hoped to." Uriel goes, "Hm. All right. Here's the circumstance: as it stands, I fear I must revoke Vox Machina's membership in the council of Tal'Dorei until further notice, for the safety of our countryside and the current tension in our relationship."
Sam: Objection! That's it. I just wanted to say that. Please continue. I just want it noted that we object strongly to this.
Matt: "I understand. And this will only continue until all of our investigations are complete."
Sam: Are we still allowed free rein to roam about as we please? Are we under arrest for anything?
Matt: "You are not under arrest. You are revoked from the council, and you will be closely watched until our investigations are complete."
Laura: How long will your investigations take?
Matt: He looks back to Asum and Asum says, "Well, depends on how quickly we can acquire the information; it could be weeks. I'll do my best to make it thorough and quick."
Laura: Are we allowed to leave the city in that time?
Matt: Uriel looks back and says, "You may leave if you wish. Know that there have been precautions taken. Should you attempt to flee, we will find you."
Liam: And when are you to look into my mind?
Laura: Weirdo! (laughter)
Liam: It freaking ends here. Right away.
Travis: Can you read my mind?
Liam: There is no spoon.
Matt: "We ought to speak to the Lyceum to find a proper individual of sufficient power and trust to do this, as Allura right now is being kept out of the scenario."
Sam: Are we allowed to speak with Allura?
Matt: "If you wish. Outside of these chambers. Do what you must to clear your name. I would like very much for this all to be true, what you're saying. But do not flee. Do not give an inclination that you attempt to escape this judgment, for we will take that as a sign of guilt."
Liam: We've no intention of going anywhere.
Matt: "Should we conclude that your actions were beyond reason and the moral fiber of this council before your return, we will have no choice to put a bounty on your heads, should you not return. I really, really do not wish to do this. Do not make me do this."
Orion: I stand up. "No need for threats, friend. Are we done here?"
Matt: "I want to believe you all. I ask you, show that my trust has not been misplaced all this time. Now, you may leave."
Sam: I look forward to the second parade you'll throw for us after our names are cleared.
Matt: "Very well."
Travis: I turn to the guards that were grabbing at their weapons and I flex real fast at them and then I walk.
Matt: Four of them go, (yelps).
Travis: Bitch! (laughter)
Matt: As you guys go back out the doors that you entered, the guards now a little closely following as you exit, leading you out of the palace, down the front steps, and essentially stand at the front of the palace gates.
Liam: I'm sorry. I was just talking to one of your friends. Have you seen a belt that is shaped like a snake? Sometimes it moves around on its own. And it answers to the name Simon, but usually it's just a belt and looks really cool. Have you seen it? Is there a lost and found I can check out? It's very dear to me.
Matt: The guard just looks for a second and goes, "I think you've got more important matters to deal with before you go looking for a belt, sir."
Liam: Where's that other guy? He was more receptive to this. Do I see that other guy?
Laura: Darling. Seriously.
Matt: The guards all turn around and start ascending the stairs.
Liam: It's on all the fan art. It really makes sense to have it on me.
Matt: They don't appear to be listening.
Liam: Keep an eye out for it. 100 gold to any chap who finds it and holds onto it for me.
Matt: Two of them stop in their step for a second and then keep walking.
Liam: I'm a nice guy! (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.
Travis: You're going to get six belts thrown at you.
Liam: That's terrible. Six.
Matt: It was a brief pause. But also. A brief pause.
Laura: You have a two in persuasion? Oh wow.
Sam: We'll break in tonight and find it.
Travis: Could we wait outside for Allura?
Liam: I'll risk it all.
Matt: All right. So you are now currently there in the cobblestone street of the Cloudtop District, removed from the Council of Tal'Dorei and left in this interesting circumstance.
Sam: Keyleth, what happened? Your magic didn't work?
Marisha: No, it worked.
Laura: What happened?
Sam: But Asum lied.
Orion: He gave her a magic winky face.
Marisha: Yeah, essentially. Yeah. He gave me like a--
Laura: What does that mean? Does that mean Uriel's under their control? I don't understand.
Liam: Is he playing some sort of long game here?
Sam: It must mean that we have something to fear from Uriel. Or someone else close.
Marisha: I don't know who to trust anymore, to be totally honest.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: It worked. I could feel it break. It worked, and he's got some sort of long game. I don't know if it's because he doesn't want Uriel to know, for whatever reason. I don't know if it's because he has some deeper, ulterior motive.
Laura: Do you think he was faking that he was healed, and maybe he wasn't?
Travis: Or maybe we have to bring proof of their vampirism back?
Marisha: No.
Travis: Oh.
Marisha: Wait. No to Vex. What was your question?
Travis: To bring back proof of them being vampires.
Sam: Proof would help. Hey! Don't we have a prisoner? Can't we question the prisoner?
Laura: Is he bleeding out? What if he's dead? We're so screwed!
Marisha: I made sure.
Laura: Yeah, the guy that Percy shot the hand off of.
Marisha: I cauterized his wounds, remember?
Sam: We should question him. He could have proof.
Laura: Oh shit! I hope everything's okay.
Orion: Wait a minute! I really need to go to Allura. She's our best interest right now.
Sam: We get it! You want her body. Now's not the time.
Orion: It is beyond that. There are several reasons to go. We need to get the Earring of Telescription. I need her to enchant something for me, too. As well as the fact I fear that our keep may be in danger. I would like to ask her if she may be able to set up a warding spell for--
Laura: Can you go get her and bring her to the keep? I need to find out if this boy is all right.
Marisha: Well, we can split up. I can go with you.
Matt: As you guys are having this discussion, the palace doors open and you hear the quick footsteps of Allura, rushing from the palace now, running towards you guys.
Laura: Saving the day. Again.
Marisha: Wait, she's coming out of the palace?
Matt: She's coming out of the palace, behind you guys. Like after the council had just closed. The meeting had finished. She basically gave chase to you guys and is now catching up to you on the street.
Sam: What the shit happened in there?
Marisha: We were just talking about you!
Matt: "Everyone-- I don't fully know what happened last night, and--" She looks to you, Tiberius, and says, "You didn't, did you? Please tell me you did not kill that woman."
Orion: Oh, I absolutely did!
Laura: But she was attacking us.
Sam: It looks bad, but she was a threat.
Orion: Her and another one with this-- what was he, a tiefling? Named the Broker attacked us. And that's why I killed her.
Matt: "Brom's divination is very clear. And he divined that the woman was currently filled with fear, attempting to flee, and unconscious when she was murdered."
Liam: How did she flee when she was unconscious?
Travis: She fled, went unconscious, then we butchered her.
Marisha: Just accept it for what it is, guys.
Matt: "I just worry. I know not what happened here, and I heard what you said, and I honestly do not trust the Briarwoods myself either. There was something about that meal and the conversation, and their presence that put me off entirely. It was strange. And what you say makes a lot of sense. Vampirism is a bit beyond what I was expecting. I did sense some powerful masqueraded arcane essence from Lady Briarwood. Look, I would recommend for this to do your best to be thorough in this. Bring back any and all information you can. From the words I hear, you probably have at best a few weeks before this comes to a close. And if you don't have enough evidence to support your argument-- well, I don't know."
Liam: Allura, all I know how to do is break locks, but I've seen these people do things with magic that have defied expectations. Why can no one look into my memory? You have looked across miles. Cannot anyone look into my mind and see?
Laura: They're going to do it!
Sam: Yes, but that might not be proof enough for them. Someone could have corrupted your mind.
Matt: "You have to understand. Not all arcane works that way. There are magics that can dabble in that realm, but none that specialize that here in Emon. Divination, yes there are elements of that. We can see the physical. We can see certain events. But to look into one's mind is a different magic entirely."
Liam: Are there no spells that can divine if someone's speaking true?
Matt: "That was attempted during that council, but after you left, Brom notified Uriel and the Council that many of you were resistant to the spell, and as such, it could not be verified."
Laura: (laughs) We should have rolled low! Just tell us you're doing it, we won't resist it! What the shit? Doesn't even trust us to tell the truth.
Travis: If we came back with proof?
Sam: What sort of proof do you think they would accept? The head of Lady Briarwood?
Laura: No, because it'll disappear the minute we kill her or something. They're vampires, I don't know what they do.
Matt: She gives a thought to that. She goes, "Interestingly enough, if an artifact or an item brought forth from them could be divined, that should tell all."
Marisha: Is there still the remaining wreckage of their carriage? Is that still there?
Matt: "The carriage has been disposed. It's been picked over, and there were remnants within the rubble of some sort of a 'siggle' of teleportation. But that is no-- a sigil, if you will." (laughter)
Travis: What sort of artifact? Like, a brooch? A handbag?
Liam: Are we talking about that motherfucker's teeth?
Orion: I need to see that sigil.
Matt: "Sigil. We're all learning together. That, I believe, has all been investigated and kept under lock and key with Asum. You would have to speak with him. I would like to help. I cannot come with you. I'm working on something else at the moment. Ah!" And she reaches into her pocket and brings out your Earring of Transcription.
Orion: Thank you so much, Lady Allura!
Matt: As she hands it to you, she gives you a really, really concerned look. And just gives it to you and hands it back. And it's a look of-- and it hits you: it's a look of disappointment with a hint of heartbreak.
Travis: Oh, that's the worst! I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. Ugh!
Liam: I feel like I've failed you.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: She looks back to you as you take it and goes, "Do your best to clear your name."
Orion: I shall.
Matt: "I know you come of noble blood, and many of you stand to inspire many others of noble blood. As celebrated heroes of this city, there is a lot more on the line here besides just your well-being. There's a lot of people in this town that look up to you. Nevertheless, I've already said more than I should. Good luck."
Laura: Thank you, Allura.
Matt: She looks behind and you can see she takes this small hood of the same material of her robe that she's wearing and puts it up over her head and rushes off towards her white tower towards the edge of the Cloudtop District.
Liam: Fucking politics.
Sam: No one insight checked her.
Travis: She's telling the truth. Let's go make sure the prisoner isn't dead.
Sam: All right. So wait. What are our avenues? We're going to have to Columbo this. What are our avenues of finding proof?
Laura: We say as we're walking back to the keep.
Sam: We have a prisoner we can question. Who knows if that will yield anything. And then, we might have to go gather evidence, which means leaving town against his word.
Laura: Well, we're allowed to leave town.
Liam: No!
Sam: No!
Laura: Yeah! No! He said we're allowed to leave. We just can't look like we're fleeing, so we tell them where we're going. They can even fucking follow us. I don't care.
Liam: So we tell them that we're going to their political-- the people that they're trying to create a political relationship with? We're just going off to invade your political allies.
Travis: Oh come on! You half-elves. I swear to god! Have you never heard of lying before? Yeah! We don't tell them where we're going. We're going on a field trip. We're going to pick berries. Fuck all, but we go there.
Orion: The only way we can go there is telling them.
Travis: What? And we're going there, what for?
Orion: When I talk to Asum and get that sigil to that damn Briarwood keep. That's how we get there.
Travis: Why don't we say we're taking a picnic-- oh, we took a wrong turn. Hey, it's the Briarwoods!
Orion: We don't have to lie to them. We tell them where we're going, and we can just go there.
Travis: We don't have to if we don't want to.
Liam: You're pretty.
Laura: Especially that beardy side, Grog.
Travis: It's a full beard right now.
Matt: What you do know is the sigil that a teleportation circle is attached to is known when you cast or create the circle. The circle does not necessarily indicate or maintain the sigil it's attached to.
Orion: It's just a piece of it?
Matt: Meaning, there are two parts to it. There is the sigil that it sends to, and there is the actual ritual circle that is created. The circle that attaches to it is not the same as the destination. There are elements of it that connect it, but you would not be able to ascertain a sigil to Whitestone immediately from looking at the initial circle.
Liam: Thanks for the cups, guys! The cup.
Travis: I just noticed that!
Liam: Well, let's go check on this poor little shit in the dungeon.
Sam: And then the next step will be to seek out Seeker Asum?
Orion: I'd like to stop by the temple real quick to pick up my decanter.
Sam: How many errands do you have to run?
Laura: Endless errands.
Sam: All right. Go run your errands! We've got a mystery to solve.
Travis: Yeah, I want to be there when we talk to the prisoner, too.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep. Are you going with them or you're--
Orion: I'm doing all the shit.
Matt: What are you doing?
Sam: He's got a list.
Matt: I would like to know the list.
Orion: I'm going to stop at an armory because I want my crossbow reinforced. I don't know what that means. I want to learn a different sigil. The one that I researched for the waste fair, or for the way-- the Feywild! There's this big city next to it that I researched, that is near it, and in that city might be a sigil. So I'm going to go see if I can learn it. And then I want to come back and start enchanting my blades.
Sam: It's a busy day.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: I can give it to you. I wrote it down.
Sam: Coming soon on Friday nights  The Adventures of Tiberius's Errands! 7:00 to 10:00 every Friday night on Twitch.
Orion: And then I have to go to the dry cleaners for my robe.
Matt: All right. So as you begin that process, the rest of you continue back to the Keep. As you approach Greyskull Keep, there are two individuals waiting for you at the gate that you do not recognize from a distance.
Sam: Wait, what? Say that again.
Matt: There's two individuals waiting for you at the gate. You can see at a distance, but you don't recognize.
Sam: They're our handlers, probably.
Liam: Grog, come on. Let's go have a talk with someone.
Laura: I walk with you.
Sam: We're all going!
Liam: Let's go arm in arm in one big line!
Laura: Well, they're right at our fucking keep. It's not like we're all headed in the same direction, anyway.
Orion: Who doesn't have a ring?
Sam: A ring of what?
Orion: An earring.
Marisha: I have one right now.
Sam: I think I do?
Laura: I have one.
Liam: I have one.
Laura: Grog doesn't have one.
Travis: How far away from the keep are we?
Matt: You're probably a good 100 to 150 feet.
Travis: I whistle really loud and say, who are these fucks in front of the keep? to the guard that we have employed.
Matt: Okay. So. Let me try and see who's on duty right now.
Laura: He has notes on who is on duty.
Matt: This would still be Shayne and Cordell. Cordell shouts down from the top of the wall and says, "I don't think they're a threat."
Travis: Right. We'll be the judge of that. As you were.
Sam: Grog, keep in mind, these are our allies.
Laura: Hello!
Matt: As you walk up and you get close, you get a better view. You're expecting ominous, armored guards. Somebody possibly assigned to escort you. Instead, you're greeted by what looks to be an older couple waiting at the gate. A man and a woman, dressed in simple clothes, weathered skin. And as you go out to them, they both smile.
Sam: We hate old people. (laughter)
Laura: Who are you?
Travis: Favored enemy!
Matt: They begin walking up, and the man steps forward. You can see he's got small dirty glasses at the end of his nose and says, "Hello, hello! Good afternoon, everyone! I'm sorry to be a bother. But unless my eyes and tales do deceive me, might you all be the heroes known as Vox Machina?"
Laura: Can I insight check to see if these guys are legit?
Sam: Legit what? Old people?
Laura: It could be Lord and Lady Briarwood, for all I know!
Liam: Me too. I did well. I rolled 18 on them.
Matt: Okay. From what you can tell, they are both happy, simple folk that are here with a tension of purpose, but nothing that seems to set off any alarms.
Sam: We are Vox Machina. I'm sure word of us has spread far and wide. We're a pretty big deal. Why have you made this journey to us?
Matt: The woman, who's holding his side, lets go of his arm and says, "We come to you humbly as representatives of the farming community just north of Emon's walls."
Marisha: Oh, I love farmers!
Matt: "I am Riley Klaus and this is my husband, Ben." "Pleasure to meet y'all."
Laura: Hi.
Matt: "You see, many of us here, we make our living through livestock and small crops." Ben takes over at this point and says, "Word is that the Sovereign will be calling down troops from Fort Daxio for a while, so the need for meats and fresh produce has been elevated." The wife, Riley, then says, "Around this time, over the past two weeks, a number of our finest cows and sheep have gone missing. No struggle or mess or signs of dire wolves. Nothing! We suspected thieves, initially, but we sent up our neighbor's boy Kyle to watch over them until sunrise and he saw the culprit. From what he described, a giant bird, larger than anything he's ever seen or heard of." Ben then takes over the conversation, "Wings at least ten carts long, tip to tip. Just swooped down, he said, without sound and in one motion snatched up one of our most virile bulls. Mr. Simms, just gone like that!"
Marisha: Mr. Simms?
Matt: "That was the bull." Riley says, "Kyle said he saw it fly northwest."
Marisha: Northwest? Can I do a nature check to see if I can recognize the creature he's describing?
Liam: Are we certain he's not describing a dragon?
Marisha: 26.
Matt: 26. You've seen some big birds in your time. This is, from what they're describing, a lot bigger than any birds you've encountered in your experience. You've heard whispers of larger birds in the wild, but you've never seen anything like that. You haven't had any personal experience hearing or seeing anything of this size.
Marisha: But it is a bird?
Matt: That's what they described it as. At night.
Laura: When did these birds start showing up?
Matt: "About two weeks ago when the whole thing started to happen." And then Ben kicks in and says, "Should this keep up, most of us will lose everything before the year is out. Now, we've talked with the leaders of the farming community this side of Emon. We've scrounged up what we could." And he brings up a couple of coin purses and she goes, "512 gold pieces, 37 silver, and 103 copper. That's all we can spare."
Laura: Keep your money.
Marisha: Yes, keep your money.
Matt: "We can't possibly--"
Liam: What about this? What if you supplied us with a small stream of produce for our servants here at the keep? For cooking, for feeding them, for feeding us when we're here? It'll be a sight less than 500; it wouldn't be nothing. You could still give us something.
Matt: "Yes! We could, we'd be more than happy to!"
Sam: However, despite what my companion is saying, we are not agreeing to go after this winged beast quite yet. We hear your plight, and we sympathize, and we will do what we can, but we have very pressing matters right now. Is there a deadline of some sort? When is your next harvesting season?
Matt: "I mean, there's no deadline, but the longer that goes by, the more and more we lose by the night. Two weeks in and we've lost half of our livestock. If the creature is this big, I imagine it eats quite a bit."
Laura: And how long of a ride is it? Is it walking distance?
Matt: "To... where?"
Laura: To your farm.
Liam: To your farm.
Sam: To your farm.
Matt: "North side of Emon."
Laura: Oh, so real close!
Matt: "Yes."
Sam: We are friends of the elderly, obviously, and also of the farming community, so we are very interested in helping you. May we talk about it a bit before we decide how and when we would tackle this problem?
Matt: They look at each other and nod and he taps her hand and says, "Yes. By all means-- If you could, please help us stop this beast from ruining our livelihood."
Marisha: And can you please tell us how to get to your place. Do you normally stay there? Are you normally home?
Matt: "We wander about the community, but we do have a homestead. If you look, it's the large red wood and partially brick-based homestead closest to the city walls, on the north farm. Right outside of Emon. It's hard to miss, if you're headed that direction."
Liam: Quickly. Presently, we will find you. Guys, we were told to sit and spin basically. I mean, what's wrong with earning some brownie points in the eyes of Uriel?
Travis: Mr. and Mrs. Kraut, as friends of the elderly--
Matt: "Klaus."
Travis: Right, Kraut. Do they normally come at night, or have they ever abducted any of your sweet bulls during the day?
Matt: "We've not seen it during the day. It'd be easier for us to identify if we had. Seems to only hunt at night."
Sam: And have they ever messed with a human?
Matt: "Not that we've heard of. Not yet." He gives you this sudden look of realization and fear. And pats and comforts his wife who suddenly realizes, oh my. Are they going to take us now?
Marisha: We'll probably be by like tonight or tomorrow morning.
Liam: Yes. Tomorrow morning at the latest. We have a little bit of business. Yeah.
Marisha: So we're in the middle of doing something. We'll get to it.
Matt: "All right. Well, thank you."
Liam: I take him by the hand and say, we will see you presently.
Sam: Here. My business card.
Liam: And you can take that to the bank.
Laura: You can't actually; it's worth nothing.
Matt: "Well, thank you for listening to us ramble on, and we look forward to hearing from you in the next day."
Laura: You will.
Matt: "All right." He pats her on the arm.
Travis: Travel safe, Mr. Kraut!
Liam: Hide your bull; hide your wife.
Matt: They both wander off.
Laura: We are in danger of being ostracized. We should really be nice to everybody right now.
Sam: We were just having a conversation about how we should try to be nice from now on. But we do have very pressing matters.
Travis: Yeah, let's get fucking in there and talk to that little--
Marisha: It's funny how that type of thing can come back to bite you in the ass.
Sam: I call up to Cordell. Oi, Cordell!
Matt: "Yeah!"
Sam: Remember when I told you not to let anyone linger outside the keep?
Matt: "To be fair, the Klauses are well-known in the community."
Travis: The Krauts?
Laura: The Klauses.
Matt: "They came here for business. I figured it was probably something you'd want to hear. I apologize."
Sam: By all means, use your judgment over the orders of your master. That's fine.
Marisha: Scanlan!
Matt: Cordell bows his head sheepishly. "I apologize. I'm sorry."
Marisha: Ignore him!
Laura: We are here to help people! We're here to help.
Matt: He does his finger like this and the gates open in towards the inside of the keep wall.
Marisha: And what is wrong with you all today?!
Sam: We had a really bad dinner last night. That's all.
Laura: I head straight to the jail.
Marisha: I follow.
Matt: As you guys are doing that, Tiberius, what's the first thing you're trying to do?
Orion: Stop by and pick up the decanter from the temple.
Matt: Okay. He said it required two days. It's been less than a day since you dropped it off, just so you're aware.
Orion: Then the only thing I do is visit the keep with the sigils library or whatever.
Matt: Oh, the Lyceum? Okay.
Liam: I'm not going. I'm just going to go hang out up on the wall outside the keep.
Matt: All right. As you head to the Lyceum, the clerk lets you in. What are you specifically looking to find or research?
Orion: The sigil that's closest to the Feywild.
Matt: Okay. In researching what they have at their disposal, you understand that the Feywild itself, because it is a separate plane, the magics to traverse it are a little more difficult to do. If you notice-- and I'll confirm here just to be sure that we're on the same page-- before I go full on this here. Pardon me, just a moment while I scan through the book. The mighty book. The book of might. Yes. Sigils of teleportation require the same plane of existence, meaning you can teleport anywhere within the Prime Material Plane that you exist in. To traverse into the Feywild, you have to actually find a door into the Feywild, and then you would be able to use a sigil from the Feywild.
Orion: Then I only pick up my decanter.
Matt: Which is not ready yet.
Orion: I don't do that! Damn, I forgot! My short-term memory is just jacked!
Matt: It's all good. It's all good.
Travis: You know, somebody's been to the Feywild.
Matt: Yeah. The Feywild. What you do find is that the Feywild-- the boundaries between this realm and the Feywild tend to grow weaker at full moons. It's tied to the moon cycle. And at certain places where nature is set to run wild. A lot of druidic tribes tend to mark these locations, and in some cases actually guard them.
Laura: We know where a hole in one is. Grog went through it.
Matt: And if you recall-- good memory-- in the Frostweald, the partially frozen forest where you had that conversation with the nymph-- that portal that she existed through was specifically a door into the Feywild, which you recognized.
Orion: What city was that near?
Matt: That was south of Westruun.
Orion: Then I'll go to the thing and I'll find the Westruun sigil.
Matt: Okay. Through your research, you do find a sigil to Westruun. This is allowing you to go into this portion for this sigil because you've already used the favor that you had to get the sigil of Kraghammer.
Orion: No, I didn't. I used the amulet and we got permission to come there. I saved that favor for this.
Matt: Right, the favor for Gilmore. All I'm saying is, you've used one of two favors to get that sigil. You have to invoke Gilmore's favor to get this one. Okay. And since you're a part of the circumstance, you acquire the secondary sigil. You now know, in your memory permanently, a sigil to Westruun. You don't know where in Westruun, but you are connected there. If you choose to teleport there, you know how to. That favor has now been used by Gilmore, so you can mark that. And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a five minute rest break. So yeah, restroom, snacks, drinks and we'll be back here in about five or so minutes. We'll see you guys and continue this tense adventure. [break]
Matt: Welcome back. We've had our break; we've returned to the table. A quick note, we are 50 subscribers away from our next giveaway.
Travis: 50? Come on!
Matt: If we can get there, that'd be awesome! We'll have our giveaway-- the signed cast Critical Role photo and the cast signed art poster by Kit Buss.
Sam: Kit Buss, ladies and gentlemen!
Matt: Yeah! So you have all returned to the keep. You have found yourselves down to the basement area. You hear the distant pinging of metal, an occasional squeaking metallic noise. Like something is being altered, turned, or quenched in a water trough. Like the process of blacksmithing.
Marisha: I go to the edge of the door and knock.
Matt: As you knock on the metal door, it's like a (boom). The pinging stops. Just hangs for a second.
Marisha: Percy? It's Keyleth.
Matt: "Not right now. Please. I'm sorry. I just need to clear my head."
Marisha: Okay. We'll be here.
Matt: A moment later, you see Percy's eyes appear at the edge of the door.
Marisha: Hi!
Matt: Just looking at them, you can see they look a little sunken, a little weary.
Marisha: Did you sleep?
Matt: "Not as much as I'd like."
Marisha: Do you need anything?
Matt: His eyes look away for a second, looks back at you. "I'm all right. Thank you."
Marisha: We went and saw Uriel. Everyone in the city hates us. They think we're all criminals.
Matt: "Great. I have to get back to my work."
Marisha: Okay, yeah.
Matt: The slit shuts.
Marisha: Oh, we'll see you later, then.
Matt: You guys, however, walk down to the other side of the cell. The cell door's been closed. The keys are hanging on the nail by it. You have not used the cell until this point. It's technically pristine and unused since the construction of the keep, but the keys still hang on the key ring. On the inside of it, there is no thatch. Nothing has been put in to really make a comfortable floor. And hanging from manacles--
Laura: He's hanging?!
Sam: We're the worst.
Matt: He was put in as a prisoner.
Laura: I go and get the keys, and I take him down from the manacles.
Matt: As she rushes into the cell, begins unlocking the manacles. He's unconscious at this time. Dirt streaked on his face and spatters of dried blood from the blast of the gun.
Marisha: I go ahead and I administer Cure Wounds.
Matt: The wound at this point has been cauterized. You cast Cure Wounds as he starts to come to consciousness, in a heap on the ground. (coughs) It appears he may be healed of any damage he may still be sustaining from that, but the fingers are gone. This is beyond the magic you're capable of. He comes to consciousness on the ground, dirtied, sore. Essentially broken before you.
Laura: Does he look like he's been bitten at all?
Matt: You want to inspect?
Laura: Can I look at his neck?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Okay. You don't have a whole lot of medicinal experience, but you take a moment and inspect both sides of his neck, tilting his head side-to-side, as he's groaning and coming to. "What's going on?" Looking at the sides of his neck, there does not appear to be any sign of any puncture wounds, anything that would be reminiscent of what your brother currently is healing from.
Marisha: Can I do an insight check to see if he is also under a mind-control spell?
Matt: At the moment, no. He is barely coming to consciousness. There isn't enough of a presence at the moment to really read past.
Laura: Hey, there. Welcome back.
Matt: "Where am I?"
Laura: You are being held, at the moment, for your own safety.
Matt: "For my own safety?"
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "How?" He looks at his hand.
Laura: Well, you were captured. We're pretty sure the Briarwoods are going to be pissed as hell that you let the carriage get hit. We're just trying to protect you, really.
Marisha: Really?
Sam: I mean, his friends all died, so.
Marisha: Do we not feel like terrible people enough already?
Sam: Let's not have this conversation in front of the prisoner. What's your name, boy!
Matt: "My name is Desmond. Desmond Otham. I am the son of a messenger, a courier of the de Rolo family."
Marisha: He's the son of a messenger! That's even more ironic!
Laura: Keyleth, do you need to step outside?
Marisha: No, I'm good. Continue. Son of a messenger.
Laura: Right now, everyone is at risk. The Briarwoods are bad people, you can attest to this, yes?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: Yes. Can you tell us everything you know about them?
Matt: "It's not going to matter. They're going to find me. No one's supposed to get away."
Laura: You did!
Travis: There's always a first time.
Matt: "I don't even know where to begin." He adjusts himself, sliding back, putting his back against the wall of the cell.
Travis: I reach into the Bag of Holding. I pull out the little goblet, and I pour some ale into a cup, and I hand him a little bit of ale. No, it's fine. I take a little sip.
Matt: "Please don't take offense if I don't trust a drink from strangers who've, well, to be honest, put me in this position."
Travis: All right. I put it beside him.
Matt: "What do you want to know?"
Laura: We want to know if the Briarwoods--
Sam: Are vampires.
Laura: Pretty much. They're vampires, right? I mean, they're vampires.
Matt: "All I know from the stories I've heard. Mothers would tell their kids not to wander out at night because dark things crawl in the shadows. From what I know of vampires, they're not supposed to go out during the day, right? But I'm sure I've seen Lady Briarwood walk in the sun many a time."
Marisha: Only Lady Briarwood?
Matt: "As I recall, yes. Lord Briarwood doesn't make too many public appearances."
Sam: Have there been any strange goings-on in their residence? Sounds you've heard? People disappearing? Boxes coming in or out?
Laura: I cast Cure Wounds on him. I know Cure Wounds, bitches! Level up!
Orion: Have I reached the keep yet?
Matt: No, not yet. You're probably about an hour away, at this point. From the time you've taken to research, find this, learn the sigil to Westruun, and begin your trek back. Fortunately, you got what you wanted, but you're out of the picture for a little bit. He flinches as you put your hand up, and as you touch him, he exhales. You get to him just as he can react, briefly.
Laura: 11. Do I add anything to that?
Matt: I believe you add your Wisdom modifier to that.
Laura: 14.
Matt: He goes, "Look, my father worked for the de Rolo family before the Briarwoods came. My father vanished the night of their fall. My mother was taken in madness and lost to the night this past year. I was left alone. However, I knew the roads well between here and Whitestone and places between, growing up, traveling with my father. So I was made to be a coachman for the new nobles. I was paid, albeit little, and I was left alone. Now, when I say the new nobles, there were nobles that lived in Whitestone and worked along with the de Rolos, and they helped oversee parts of the town, the business, and the people. They had been there for many generations of their respective families, all under the de Rolos' guidance. But the night the castle fell, those nobles were dragged out. It's strange. I mean, after the brutality of that first night, it took days before the people of Whitestone knew what had happened. We saw the fires, we heard the battles, but no word of the victors until three days had passed. We were too scared to approach. By then, the Briarwoods called a town meeting. They explained their new rule over the town. A number objected, which is expected. Many strong-willed folk in Whitestone, those days. They were subsequently shot down at arrow-point. The rest were quiet. They then dragged out the noble families and executed them, gifting their property and titles to the various cut-throats and mercenaries they had hired, brought across the channel to help them take the town. They're not just two people; they've used a lot of money and influence from wherever they came from and brought a whole slew of very dastardly folk, who have since been given the titles once held by the other nobles of Whitestone, living in their homes, taking their tithes and most of the profits made from the businesses they've forced us to continue to run from within the city. A number of families fled into the woods the night after the executions, using the shadows of a moonless evening to keep safe. They were all found hanging from the Sun Tree the next morning. They kept things going as they were, mostly: farming, logging, manning the white marble mines. Business went as usual, all filling the pockets of the new nobles and the Briarwoods. We were given food, kept our immediate property. As long as we didn't attempt to leave, we were promised safety. That lasted for a few years, until the nobles grew bored. Twitchy. They began to abuse the people of Whitestone: scare us for fun, brand, cut, steal the children, leave them back, destroyed. They treat us like animals. Folks went missing. I was beaten so bad by my employer, Count Tylieri. But Lord Briarwood noticed, one night he was passing through the city. He saw wounds on my back when he was meeting with Count Tylieri. When he asked me in private how I got them, I couldn't lie. Couldn't resist him. He has a way of drawing the truth out of you. Now, he told me this unrefined violence was boorish to him and his wife. That was the last I ever saw of Lord Tylieri. Lord and Lady Briarwood took me in as their own driver and showed me Tylieri hanging from that same Sun Tree the next morning. I was thankful, then. In a strange way, life had been so terrible for so long, it was the first time I saw someone reach out and save me. They took me in as their driver after that. It was a better thing to be away from the anger and the fists of the thugs. But the more I got to know the Briarwoods, the more nightmarish I realized they were. Behind the walls of that castle was no longer a grand fortress that we heard it was. Seeing it, keeping watch and guard over our people. No, that was a domain of perverse magics and sacrilege, it was. The green fog drifting out from the ground where it stood. The same servants still run the halls, but they aren't living. They're walking vessels of undeath, their flesh slowly tearing away. The garden in back lies shriveled, a foul green mist forever pouring out. They're excavating something in the dungeon, plundering pieces. A lot of their attention seems to be down there; I don't know why. I dare not wander too far down. They bring up old things. Ancient things. Relics, books, bones. You live in that world long enough, you believe there is no way out. Death would be easy, though I've seen that death is no real end there. It's just the beginning of a whole new terrible existence. A far worse fate."
Laura: If we keep you here, protected, would you be willing to tell your story to someone else?
Matt: "Who would you want me to tell it to?"
Laura: The emperor. The guards here. An army that could go and fight the Briarwoods.
Matt: "Maybe."
Marisha: This could be an option to save Whitestone, and you would have your freedom.
Matt: "I don't know. You don't know what it's like. You don't know what they've done. They're going to find me."
Sam: We can protect you. We are safe here in this keep, and you're surrounded by very powerful allies now.
Travis: We've stood before them, and we did not fall.
Laura: It's true.
Matt: "I'll think about it."
Marisha: Would you like to stay in the guest room upstairs? You'd be more comfortable. You could get a good night's rest.
Laura: Far more comfortable. A little less safe. I'm going to put it out there.
Matt: That resonates with him immediately, and his eyes flash open. "I mean no disrespect, but if this is safe, then I'd rather stay here."
Laura: I think it is. And we will bring a bed down to you, make sure you're comfortable. I don't want you sleeping on the floor. That's terrible.
Matt: "You're all being very accommodating."
Travis: You'll get every consideration for protection. We value your info very much.
Marisha: You're also the key to our own freedom, so it's important.
Sam: You also caught us on a day where we're trying to be nicer to people. (laughter)
Sam: Lucky for you.
Liam: Just be glad you're not an old woman.
Matt: "I'll stay here for now."
Laura: All right.
Matt: "I need to think on it. I've been promised such protection before."
Sam: From the Briarwoods?
Matt: "From a few. And they're dead. An enemy of an enemy doesn't necessarily make them a friend, I've discovered."
Marisha: No, but it can make them allies if they have mutual enemies. Of their enemies. It's a little complicated.
Matt: This whole conversation, the emotional recalling of everything, you can see has been very taxing on him and his still mostly conscious state. He looks exhausted, scared, and still trying to suss out all the information coming at him right now.
Marisha: Grog, why don't you carry the bed down from upstairs?
Travis: Not a problem. Keep the goblet nearby. It is very nice ale.
Marisha: Would you like something to eat?
Matt: "Yes, please."
Marisha: We'll have our staff bring down some food.
Matt: He takes the goblet. He looks at it, smells it, but still holds it at bay as you walk off. You eventually go-- easy enough for you-- take the bed. You have to turn it to the side to take it out, which causes all of the cushions to fall out.
Travis: Aw, shit. (laughter)
Travis: I grab a little pillow with my toes, and I hobble down.
Matt: It takes about 20 minutes and three trips, but you manage to get the bed down there from the guest room.
Travis: Not a problem.
Matt: When you fit it in the cell-- and it's not a large cell; it's maybe ten by ten feet maximum. You place it there. As you guys walk back, you notice as you see Grog walking back down the stairway-- right around the corner as you go down the steps, the hallway goes to the cell, and it turns to the right and to the left to the workshop. You see around the corner a shoulder, listening in. There's a person. And you recognize that it is Percy. Percy has stepped out of the workshop and apparently has been hearing everything this entire time.
Laura: Are you all right?
Matt: "I'm fine." And Percy immediately steps away and you hear the door close with a slam.
Laura: Give him time.
Sam: So moody!
Laura: So yeah, I'm going to lock it. I'm just going to lock your door. To make sure you're safe, make sure nobody can get in.
Matt: "Keep him away from me. Who is that?"
Sam: He's a friend. I know it doesn't seem like it from the condition of your paw, but he's a friend. He's in the same boat as you, trying to stay safe from danger.
Laura: The Briarwoods destroyed his family, as well.
Matt: And you see now, there's like this look of tension on his face that's mixed with tired. And eventually finding the bed and takes the goblet-- still filled, has not drunk from it-- just slips it next to the side of the bed. Eventually food is brought down.
Laura: And a chamber pot, because come on!
Matt: All the basic pleasantries are brought within the cell. He lies on the bed and takes the plate up with him and starts just scarfing some of the bread rolls down. And immediately starts going for the mashed potatoes. You can see a decent meal hasn't been had in quite a while. Especially the journey, what is essentially a seven to eight day journey from Whitestone, probably has not been very kind to him. Eats and then promptly passes out on the bed. Food still mashed on the side of the face. Just goes straight into a slumber.
Travis: Is there any other entrance to the cell area besides the door? No barred windows or anything like that?
Matt: No. It's underground. It's all solid, solid stone walls. And there is the barred front door, and then just goes right into the hallway that goes up the stairs to your left and across the way and around the corner to the workshop.
Travis: You can't cast any kind of alarm system? A trigger?
Laura: So that Percy can't get anything through there?
Marisha: Let me reference my spell tome. It's not a common one. It's situational. But let me check real quick. I haven't read that chapter from my book in a while.
Orion: Is Allura on the way back from the Lyceum?
Matt: No, the Lyceum is in the Erudite District. Allura's tower is in the Cloudtop, which is the central part of Emon.
Laura: I do want to go check out that bird creature at the farmhouse tonight.
Sam: Yes. Well, have we stationed a guard down there?
Travis: We should. We have five or six.
Sam: All right. I'll go talk to Cordell. That's his name, right?
Travis: No, not Cordell. Let's get somebody else.
Laura: Get the crossbow guy that we like so much. The guy that's the captain of the guards.
Sam: Is that Kendrick? Or Shayne? Oh, the girl?
Laura: No, the guy. He's awesome and he's an archer, as well.
Sam: Jarett?
Laura: Jarett. That's it!
Sam: All right, we'll get Jarett. Oh, Jarett?
Matt: You make your way to the back part of the wall, and there is a small tower that's constructed as part of the back wall. That's where Jarett usually keeps watch. Jarett has the in-between shift between the guards, so he can be present for both sides and keep a watch during the afternoon until the nighttime. Probably till about midnight or so. So as you make your way out of the keep, Tiberius, are you heading back to the keep or are you heading toward the Cloudtop District? This will dictate whether or not you show up around this time.
Orion: I'm going to Allura's.
Laura: I'm staying down in the prison, just for the time being. I don't want to leave him alone with Percy.
Matt: You go to find Jarett, who's up at the top of the tower. And as you call to him, Jarett leans over. And you see him, you know, short jet-black hair, darker complexion. Very handsome, younger, early-twenties guy. Well-dressed over his studded leather armor that he wears underneath and has the crossbow on the side. He leans over. "Scanlan, it has been some time. It is so good to hear from you. What can I be of service for?"
Sam: We need you to watch a prisoner for us, downstairs in our jail cell, which we had built and are now using. You'll be guarding the prisoner to make sure he doesn't escape, but also making sure he stays safe. He possesses information that's very valuable to us. And one of the people who hires you might try to kill him, so if Percy tries to go in there, can you stop him without hurting either party?
Matt: "I imagine this would be very well-suited for my skill set. It will be strange to keep watch against one of my employers, but he's been a bit sheepish around me anyway."
Sam: You think you could take Percy?
Matt: "Well, I think I can at least talk some sense into him!"
Travis: I like him!
Sam: Wow! Jarett, you're ballsy! Just out of curiosity, if he was running at you, what would you do? (laughter)
Matt: "Well, first and foremost, I would dive in the forward motion, leg out, to put him off balance. This would be from a frontal melee-- you're messing with me, aren't you?"
Sam: A little bit!
Matt: "Ah, gnomes! Very well."
Sam: Do you need anything to help?
Matt: "I have access to my own private armory, and I have utmost faith."
Sam: All right. Well, keep him safe and there's an extra five gold in it for you?
Laura: Oh! Pathetic!
Sam: I don't know! Ten! Ten gold!
Matt: "Gnomes."
Sam: I don't know how money works. We'll talk to Vex about it.
Matt: "Certainly. All right. I will do this." And he stands up, and goes and starts gathering his general setup supplies inside the guard tower. As you walk back to the keep, you hear him whistle and start calling out to Shayne to go ahead and take over, up in the tower.
Liam: I wasn't there for any of that. I was upstairs on the roof, just thinking.
Matt: Tiberius, you make your way into the Cloudtop District. As you come to the front gates of the district, the guards that normally recognize you and welcome you in, recognize you and stand firm, weapons at the ready.
Orion: At Allura's tower?
Matt: At the Cloudtop District entirely. You guys had to get written permission to enter there when you first came to Emon, anyway, since that's where the nobility and many of the important figures of Emon reside. It appears that since you've been taken out of the Council and you're under investigation, your access to such a sensitive location within Emon has been temporarily revoked, and the guards are not letting you through.
Orion: Is that it? So I just turn around? Go back?
Matt: It's up to you. The guards are just there, standing.
Orion: Greeting and salutations. I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia. Moreover, a member of Vox Machina, over at Greyskull Keep. It seems that you all are posturing and whatnot. (chuckles) It's adorable. But I'm here to see Lady Allura. Could you let her know that I would like to speak to her, or get out of my way so I can just go over there and tell her myself?
Matt: "We have direct orders to not let you or any other member of Vox Machina into the Cloudtop District until your investigation is complete. So no, and no."
Orion: Well, do the second thing. If you don't do one thing, do one of the other things.
Matt: "Your information and wish has been processed, taken into consideration. Thank you very much. Please be on your way."
Orion: Oh, it has been, it has been processed! Oh, that's good to know! I appreciate that. Very well. I cast Fly on myself and I go back to the keep.
Matt: Okay. (whoosh) They both did not expect that exit. You essentially Superman-ed. You're just like (thud). Little cloud of smoke in the shape of a dragonborn left behind. All right. So as you cruise over, you see in the distance, from where you're standing at the top of the keep, you see a distant bead of dark shadow that approaches and grows larger, and it is an air-cruising Tiberius making his way towards the keep.
Liam: I hide behind-- I don't want to get hit, so I'm going to crouch down a little bit, carefully behind one of the pieces of wall. Yeah. Rough landings, sometimes.
Orion: I fly in. Vox Machina!
Liam: Easy. Be careful.
Orion: Sorry. Hi. What are you doing? Are you up here thinking?
Liam: Why, I suppose I was. The others are downstairs interrogating that boy. Where have you been?
Orion: Off doing things that wasn't really that productive, overall, but they don't like me anywhere, especially now.
Liam: Do you want to have a drink?
Orion: Yes, actually, I do.
Liam: I've got a flask. You normally drink water. You want a shot, though?
Orion: Yes, I would love some alcohol. This calls for alcohol.
Liam: I pull out my flask, and I'm amazed, because I've never seen this and I hand it over to him.
Orion: Oh yes. (whoosh)
Sam: Did you eat the flask?
Orion: No, fire breath.
Liam: Do you want to pass that bad boy back? Is it hot?
Matt: It's empty.
Liam: Oh, it's empty! Well, I guess that was worth it.
Orion: (slurred) What? What are you talking about? Don't you tell me how to drink. Oh, you!
Travis: I come out from the castle into the courtyard, and I go, hey! I feel like chicken tonight! Can we go hunt this big bird?
Liam: Tiberius-- I just got him drunk!
Travis: Really?
Orion: (slurred) He gave me a shot of his flask water, and it's so good.
Travis: Are you sure you didn't hit him with the blunt side of your knife again?
Liam: No, no, he took a shot of the old firewater, and I don't know. We might want to slap him a bit--
Orion: (slurred) Allura doesn't like me anymore because I killed that bitch who tried to kill us, and now she's fucking-- nobody likes us!
Liam: Let's find Keyleth.
Travis: Yeah. Smart. Keyleth!
Marisha: What? I was reading. What?
Travis: Tibs got turnt up. Will you fix it?
Marisha: How?
Orion: Vax gave me--
Marisha: What did you do? Why are you touching me?
Orion: Oh, I love protecting you, it is-- and Lockheed is, he loves you, too--
Marisha: Don't touch me right now!
Orion: See, I'm telling you, nobody likes me.
Liam: I gave him his first drinky. I'm sorry. Do you think you could pull him out of it?
Marisha: What?
Liam: I thought he was going to say no! He didn't leave me any.
Orion: It's good. Hi. How are you? I'm Tiberius-- Draconia. You are princess pretty face. He likes you, too.
Liam: Vax walks away, off the roof. Out of here. I'm gone!
Travis: Grog is riveted.
Orion: Human kissy mouth, with you is-- (vomits) (laughter)
Orion: I'm good.
Marisha: If you touch me one more time!
Orion: Oh! Sorry. Did you need to go somewhere?
Marisha: I am doing something else, a request that was already made previously, before "can we fix drunk Tiberius," so I'm a little busy! Why don't you go sleep it off, take a nap, and I will deal with you in a second.
Orion: Is it sleepy time?
Marisha: For you.
Orion: Should I cast Fireball?
Marisha: Oh my god. And I shove him into the cell and put him in bed--
Travis: No, we're not in the prison. We're out in the courtyard.
Marisha: Oh, I thought that you said-- everyone was like, Keyleth!
Laura: I'm still in the prison. Everybody else is out of the prison.
Matt: So where do you push him?
Orion: She pushed me off the roof.
Marisha: No! I thought we were downstairs.
Orion: I fall off the roof. I still have Fly on myself, don't I?
Marisha: You don't fall off the roof. I don't know what I do with him. I let him pass out.
Orion: I'm going to get a sandwich.
Marisha: I let him go get a sandwich.
Sam: I encourage sandwich! (laughter)
Matt: That's the quote of the night. Encouraged to get a sandwich, Tiberius wanders off. What are you doing to prepare what you were doing?
Marisha: I don't know! I got distracted!
Orion: I'm not there.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Well, as the day progresses, what would you guys like to do?
Marisha: Wait. My idea. Okay. We were wanting extra fortification? We were wanting extra protection. Okay? I can't necessarily cast a big spell. I could cast Hallucinatory Terrain. We have a few options; I'm giving them to you all. I can cast Hallucinatory Terrain to make this look like something else. I don't think-- I don't know. I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know. I could conjure a few woodland beings for, like, extra bears. We could have some bears guarding the palace. I could also throw up a Wall of Thorns, to barrier the cell with the wall of thorns. You're not here?
Sam: I think everyone left. I think it's just you and me up here, and drunk Tiberius.
Marisha: I went downstairs, and I'm saying this to the group so I don't have to repeat myself!
Orion: Oh, so then I turn around with my sandwich and am like, we have to just make Allura talk to us. She can fix everything.
Travis: I grab Tiberius's mouth and I cover it. Please continue.
Sam: Wall of Thorns could be good.
Laura: I like Wall of Thorns.
Marisha: The thing with Wall of Thorns is it's not super big. It's 60 feet.
Sam: That's pretty big!
Laura: Oh. That's not the whole place, though.
Sam: Oh, 60 feet long. I thought you meant high.
Marisha: No, it's 100 feet high. It's really high. Actually, I don't know how high it is. Don't quote me on that. But it's not that long, but we could fortify the doors more. Have bears. We could do multiple things, too.
Liam: I think that the Hallucinatory Terrain wouldn't work. I felt like they could see right through me.
Travis: I think so, too.
Marisha: On the Briarwoods?
Laura: Yeah, they can see through illusions pretty darn well.
Sam: Listen, Percy's here. He can defend for us.
Orion: No, you need a warding spell.
Sam: Why don't we just leave someone behind?
Marisha: Percy's behind.
Travis: Percy's here and so are five? Six? How many employees do we have?
Laura: Our very capable guards.
Travis: Why don't you make some extra bears that don't hate us?
Marisha: Huh?
Travis: Why don't you make some extra bears that don't hate us?
Marisha: All right, I'll make some extra bears.
Orion: Put some little hats on them and make them cute.
Liam: Do you think you could fix him? Because he's a lot of firepower if we're going to go--
Marisha: What gets rid of drunkenness? (laughs)
Laura: Maybe Restoration?
Matt: Restoration would probably take care of it.
Marisha: I don't want to burn a Restoration spell on your drunkenness.
Laura: Can you cast little Restoration?
Matt: You could also just give it a couple of hours. Drink a lot of water.
Travis: What time is it?
Matt: At this point, it's probably close to 3 00 in the afternoon.
Travis: So it's 3 00 in the afternoon. The bird doesn't even come until night. We could let him wear it off.
Marisha: What time is it?
Sam: 3 00. We just established this. We're going to wait until night and go.
Laura: She said she hated you. How did that feel?
Liam: Fine. That was fine. That was the heat of the moment. She was angry. We're a team.
Matt: All right. What's the plan, guys?
Sam: The plan is we're going to let him sober up. We're going to give him some coffee. And then we're going to set off for the north farmlands at dusk.
Orion: Oh, we should get some corn and other harvestments at the farms.
Marisha: I make an army of bears.
Matt: Okay. This concentration will last an hour.
Laura: Oh! That's it.
Matt: The Conjure Woodland Beings?
Marisha: Wait! No! Hang on. What if I conjure a bear, and then-- let me make sure, while they figure their stuff out. See, we're all figuring stuff out?
Laura: What if I leave Trinket in the prison with Jarett?
Travis: Yeah! That won't freak him out at all.
Sam: Well, with Cordell. Jarett's down in the cell. This is defense against invading vampires.
Marisha: Okay! I have a better idea!
Travis: Yep?
Sam: Oh my god.
Marisha: Why don't I conjure an elemental, and then I can cast Planar Binding on him and he'll hang out for 24 hours.
Sam: Great! Do it. Make it done. Let's go kill a bird.
Travis: Lead with that next time.
Marisha: I was figuring it out. It's new.
Sam: You've got to talk it through.
Marisha: Figuring it out.
Travis: That's awesome!
Matt: Yep! That'll do.
Travis: Don't vampires hate fire? Can you do fire?
Laura: Yeah, fire! Fire elemental!
Liam: Running water.
Laura: Ooh, water elemental! (gasps) Tiberius, remember that you--
Travis: He's drunk!
Laura: I know.
Sam: Don't talk to him.
Travis: He won't remember anything.
Orion: (slurred) I love how you shoot arrows at things' eyeballs.
Sam: I use Minor Illusion to create Lockheed, and I have him scamper away.
Orion: Oh, that's you. But where are you going? You go play up there. Tell your brother to be good. Anyway, you're so pretty.
Matt: So are you doing that, Marisha? Keyleth, are you summoning an elemental?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay. Which kind?
Marisha: Water elemental.
Matt: Okay. And you cast Planar Binding. Part of the material component cost is a gem that's worth at least 1,000 gold pieces.
Travis: I have one of those.
Laura: You do?
Travis: Yeah. It's a jewel that's red and palm-sized.
Laura: I have a diamond of awesome. And a regular diamond, as well.
Liam: If I create a trap here, can you bind some magic to it?
Orion: You can do anything with magic. You can make things go. You can make things stop.
Travis: I cover Tiberius's mouth again.
Laura: I give her a diamond.
Matt: All right. Is this the awesome diamond or the regular diamond?
Laura: This is a regular diamond. The awesome diamond is special.
Matt: All right.
Laura: No! Don't do that!
Marisha: I know! Why do you do that?
Laura: Diamonds are really expensive! Any diamonds!
Marisha: I know! And an awesome diamond has got to be more than 1,000, so this time there's got to be at least 1,000. Grog, what kind of jewel do you have?
Travis: It's a palm-sized ruby.
Marisha: A palm-sized ruby?
Travis: Yeah, I got a big palm!
Marisha: Tiberius.
Sam: No, just don't.
Matt: Vex. Your keen eye is able to ascertain that the palm-sized ruby is worth roughly 1,200 gold pieces and would be suitable for this ritual.
Laura: I think we should use the ruby. Because I have an eye for these things.
Travis: Do we think they're going to come while we do this? Do we want to waste it? Because that's an awesome outside defense. Do we want to waste it for this? What if they're coming? Does it cost one jewel per--
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Maybe we should save that, because that's awesome!
Liam: Is there a possibility, DM, that I could-- if he's sobered up-- if I set a trap, that a spell of his could be bound to it, somehow, and go off? I have no idea.
Matt: It's hard to say. There are certain spells that can enable that. That can take certain spells that trigger at a certain time. Nothing that's particularly in your guys' realm of experience or understanding though, unfortunately.
Liam: All right. So I can look into it for the future, but not today.
Travis: Keyleth, I like that. I think we should keep it in case there is an actual attack coming. Because it might just, 24 hours and then we waste it. Nobody came.
Marisha: That's true. To be fair, the castle's being heavily watched by outsiders, as well.
Sam: Okay! Listen. Let's just go.
Orion: Grog is big. Scanlan's small. Everything is great. Hi.
Liam: Can we leave Trinket? To watch.
Laura: What? He's going to go down in the prison with Jarett.
Matt: Okay. You bring Trinket down. Trinket stands watch right in the center, plops down right up against the bars.
Laura: I knock on Percy's door and say, Percy?
Matt: "Yes?"
Laura: Trinket's out here. If you need anything, you just come out and you pet him.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: Welcome.
Orion: I also go up to the door and go, Trinket. (mumbling) Percy.
Laura: Aren't you sober yet?
Orion: No, it's been like five minutes, hasn't it?
Matt: Yeah. Over time, over the next two to three hours or so, you guys have set up a place to go. They have given you some water, and you've managed to sober up a bit.
Liam: I actually picked his pocket and took his bottle of endless water. Don't you have a bottle of water like that?
Matt: No. That is currently left to be blessed for holy water.
Liam: Oh. Oh, well.
Travis: And we take the scenic route to let him walk it off as we head up towards Big Bird's house.
Sam: Great!
Matt: All right. So. You guys make your way around the outskirts of Emon under moonlight. It's a three-quarter waxing moon. You make your way to the farm vicinity on the north side of the city. It doesn't take long for you to eventually suss out the house that matches the description that you were given by the Klauses. You knock on the door, and they eagerly greet your arrival and invite you in. "So glad you all could make it. Have you decided? Have you given our community's request some thought?"
Sam: We're here to help. We're the heroes that you asked for.
Travis: We love old people.
Matt: "Thank you. That's really good of you. We will happily provide you with fresh produce, going forward. We've talked to a few of the members of the community and we're going to make sure that's taken care of."
Sam: Where do you think we should stake out this bird? Where are your livestock kept?
Matt: "The livestock are kept on the eastern side of this community. If you look about, say about half a mile out to where the actual residences stop being clustered together, you'll see there are a number of large livestock containment areas. Hard to miss out there. We have pens for sheep; we have pens for cows; we have pens for horses, other beasts of burden. That whole vicinity is where most of these attacks seem to be coming. So that's probably your best bet there."
Liam: And the biggest you have are the bulls, you said?
Matt: "Bulls. We have a few big cows, as well. We've lost a few of them, unfortunately."
Travis: That'll be all we need.
Laura: Can one of us polymorph into a giant cow?
Sam: Sure.
Marisha: I could also talk to cows again. Maybe these cows will know something.
Travis: We head out to the pasture.
Marisha: First can I ask her, you said your neighbor boy, Kyle?
Sam: Kyle. The neighbor boy. The neighbor boy's son. Yes.
Matt: "That's true. Kyle's the one who originally spotted it, yeah."
Marisha: Where does he live?
Matt: "He's actually the son of the man who runs most of the livestock areas over there. You can go and head over there. He's probably still up, keeping his eye out in case it comes back."
Marisha: Thank you. I go to Kyle.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way over there. It's easy to find. There's large pens. You can see that for as big as the pens are built and their structure, they are noticeably dwindled. You can see why there's been some worry in the community here. The fact that it's only been two weeks and this many creatures are gone is a little disconcerting. As you get there, you can see the house has its light on. There are glowing windows. And sitting in a chair, holding a crossbow across his lap, you see a 19-year-old boy, rugged chin growth, dirty red hair that's disheveled. And he's sitting there looking around in the sky. Rocking back and forth in his chair as you approach. "Who goes there?"
Sam: Don't worry, we're friends. We're friends of the Klauses. Mr. and Mrs. Klaus.
Matt: "Okay. Okay. So you the ones they say was coming to help?"
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: Aye.
Laura: We hear you have a keen eye, Kyle.
Matt: "I've seen some things, yeah."
Sam: Where have they been attacking lately?
Matt: Points to the whole area in front of him and says, "Are you keeping watch now? Great. Thank you."
Marisha: No! Wait! Don't leave yet. We need you.
Orion: Yes, yes. Keyleth. We are Vox Machina. Over from Greyskull Keep. I'm Tiberius Stormwind.
Marisha: That's irrelevant. The point is, I was wondering if you had any more information about the creature.
Matt: "I mean, other than the fact that it was just a really big bird. Really big. Huge."
Marisha: Do you remember any other details? Any other defining details other than "bird?"
Matt: "It's hard to see in the moonlight."
Sam: When it picks up a cow or whatever it's been picking up, does it strike with the beak or the claws? The talons.
Matt: "Claws, and sometimes it takes two at a time, one in each claw, and just carries them away. "
Orion: Have you seen any of its droppings anywhere?
Matt: "No. "
Travis: Have you managed to hit it with your crossbow?
Matt: "I've missed."
Liam: And you're certain this is a feathered beast, or no?
Matt: "Best I can see. It's dark out here at that time of night and it looks like a bird. It doesn't make any noise and swoops on down and takes them away and flies off in that direction."
Travis: I've heard that those giant birds are attracted to red-headed, 19-year-old, scruffy-chin folk with crossbows.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Travis: Awesome.
Matt: This would be with your charisma.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Nice. He goes, "Well, I don't want to be here, then. You guys can keep an eye out. I've got to go." And unloads the bolt in the crossbow, slings it up under his arm--
Sam: Wait! Before you leave. I'm sorry. I have an itch. And it can only be scratched with a cowbell. Do you have a cowbell anywhere around here? I just need a cowbell. Can I borrow a cowbell from you?
Matt: "Your kid's weird." And he keeps walking.
Marisha: Your kid is weird!
Sam: I'm not a child!
Laura: Do I see any cowbells on the ground?
Matt: You can take a glance about. You eventually can see that there is set up on one of the fences that fences in the cows, there is a cowbell, yes.
Laura: Hey, there's a cowbell, Scanlan.
Sam: Great. It will help the ruse. Here's my plan we're all cows. Is that an okay plan?
Laura: I like it!
Marisha: I'm into this plan. But doesn't that essentially make us the bait?
Sam: Yes, we're our own bait. Are you cool with that?
Laura: Should one of us maybe not be a cow?
Marisha: Well, here's the thing, maybe a few of us should not be cows because only a few people are going to have the ability to turn out of being a cow once they are a cow, unless they take damage.
Travis: We went from all cows to pretty much no one is a cow.
Laura: No, Keyleth is definitely a cow. No, I mean-- I didn't-- we didn't mean like that. You're very lovely.
Marisha: It's okay. What Vax said was way worse, earlier.
Travis: How do you come out of being a cow, if you are one?
Sam: I can get rid of it.
Travis: You would do it? Let's do it! When else are we all going to be cows? Come on! Unless it kills them instantly, we'll be fine.
Orion: I'm fine. I go invisible.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I'm going to lay in wait with an arrow. All the rest of you can be cows.
Liam: I think I'm better served waiting to strike.
Sam: You and me, Grog. We're cows!
Liam: If it grabs one of them, I'll deal more damage. If it grabs me, I'll deal no damage. But if it grabs Scanlan cow, I can--
Marisha: Another thing is, I can turn into a cow. I can turn someone else into a cow. Well, Polymorph is a concentration spell.
Sam: I can turn us all into cows.
Marisha: Oh. Because you got that thing.
Travis: Cow or no, Keyleth? Give us your answer.
Marisha: Oh, I'm a cow.
Sam: Seeming.
Orion: Oh, we are not actually cows?
Sam: We'll just seem like cows.
Marisha: Except for me who is going to be an actual cow.
Orion: If it's Polymorph, I couldn't cast stuff. I redact my Invisibility and I'll be a cow. I'm also going to be a cow. I want to be a brown cow.
Marisha: We're all cows! Just embrace it.
Matt: You can't change a target's body type.
Sam: What? No.
Matt: So the same form of your limbs-- you're right.
Sam: You can't change size, but we can all be Grog-sized cows or Scanlan-sized cows.
Matt: It's going to be an array of very strangely sized cows.
Marisha: Scanlan would be like a calf. Big calf.
Sam: What do you think?
Matt: I'll allow it! (cheering and laughter)
Sam: I'll allow it! (cheering and laughter)
Sam: Gather close to me!
Travis: We want to get in the pen first, right?
Sam: Yes, let's go into the pen, and if I may, I'm going to wear the cow bell.
Travis: Sure! You've earned it. (laughter)
Laura: How you going to put it? I'm just going to put it around your neck right now.
Travis: Super loose.
Matt: You guys make your way into the cow pen. The little bit of moonlight that's coming down from the sky illuminates. You see the cows are clustered underneath this overhang that is used for temporary shelter. You hear this distant (mooing) as you approach and make noise. No one's not too upset yet. It's more low muttering.
Travis: What if that was attraction?
Matt: Not yet.
Marisha: If we use Seeming, we just appear to be cows, but we can still speak, right?
Matt: Yeah. Anything sees you as cows--
Marisha: Would be like, holy shit, those are talking cows!
Sam: It's "cow-moo-flage." (groaning)
Sam: Thank you.
Orion: That's good.
Matt: I have to give you experience for that. (laughter)
Liam: Wait. What's going on? Are we turning into cows?
Sam: We just will seem like cows.
Liam: I don't understand magic.
Travis: Just go along. Go along.
Laura: That way we can ambush the bird.
Marisha: We are going to look like cows. Are we going to look like cows to each other, too?
Matt: You'll find out.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: As you all gather around the small gnome, currently adorned with the cowbell around his neck.
Liam: Just like the brothels, eh?
Matt: You complete the spell and with a sudden (whoosh) of cold night air, your vision blurs and you blink for a second. You look around and Vox Machina is now, instead, an array of slightly smaller than average cows. (mooing)
Sam: (barks) Oh, wait. No.
Matt: You're, by the way, more of a calf.
Laura: You are so cute, Scanlan.
Marisha: Okay, shall we go interview some cows?
Laura: Let's go talk to some cows. I want to walk over to the cows with you.
Matt: You guys step up, awkwardly, towards the cows, some of which are sleeping, some of which are noticing and sitting there just chewing.
Marisha: Which one looks like the alpha male?
Laura: The one that's got horns.
Matt: There are no males in this pen, because they are cows.
Orion: I try to speak to the cow.
Matt: Okay. What do you say?
Orion: Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
Matt: You speak Common. You don't know Cow.
Marisha: Tiberius, just because you look like a cow doesn't mean you can talk to the cows. The cows don't understand English. No matter if you look like a cow, they still don't understand Common.
Liam: Boy, if Uriel could see us now. (laughter)
Travis: We are "cow-nsel" worthy.
Marisha: I cast Speak With Animals.
Matt: This is the best Vox Machina adventure ever! All right, you cast Speak With Animals.
Marisha: Yes. Actually, how many animals can I hit with Speak with Animals? It is called Animals, right? Or is it just Speak with Animal?
Matt: I think it affects you. I think it gives you the ability to speak with.
Marisha: Oh, just me the ability?
Orion: You're Dr. Doolittle.
Marisha: Oh, yeah. I think you're right. Okay, so I cast Speak With Animals on myself.
Matt: All right. Yep! On self for ten minutes.
Orion: Make sure the cow-- What? She may know a cow that is over there.
Marisha: Okay, so I go up. Is there a cluster of nice-looking ladies, sitting around?
Matt: All the cows are clustered in this one corner, up against each other for body warmth. And there are few that are just like (moo).
Marisha: Hello, ladies. Good evening.
Matt: (moo) Which is what you guys hear. You hear as a response: "What are you doing? We're trying to sleep."
Marisha: I do apologize to awaken you. I was just curious if you could tell me a little bit about some of the events that have been transpiring around here lately? Mainly, the results of your kind getting killed?
Matt: "My kind?"
Orion: Just ask about the bird!
Marisha: Have you seen a giant bird flying around? Anyone?
Matt: At which point, all the cows start shuddering and say, "Yes. Haven't you? It keeps taking us. Why do you think we're hiding under this?"
Marisha: Oh, sure.
Matt: "Be careful. If you stay out there, it'll see you."
Marisha: Right. Where, exactly? Where have they been-- okay. Damn, cows! It's never--
Sam: Keyleth, what vital information have you learned?
Marisha: I'll get back to you in one second. Can you tell me anything about what it looks like?
Matt: "It's big and has wings. It's fast, and it keeps taking us."
Orion: Ask her where the moon is at night--
Marisha: Does it seem to come at a certain time of the night?
Matt: "The dark time."
Orion: It's a cow. This is the same as before.
Travis: Because nothing is happening I am now trying to eat grass.
Matt: You bend down, and take clusters with your hand, and start eating grass.
Orion: Oh, we are ourselves, still?
Matt: Yeah, you are not actually physically cows. You are still yourselves. You just look like cows.
Sam: I, for once, and it's not weird, I just shit on the floor. (laughter)
Sam: Seems totally normal.
Travis: We are in it, baby!
Laura: I'm just going to notch a bow to my bow, just to keep a lookout to the sky.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Can I Prestidigitate smells?
Matt: You could.
Orion: Sweet. Go ahead. (laughter)
Sam: All right, so we go out into the field.
Marisha: They're cows. I forgot that talking to cows never goes well.
Laura: Yeah, remember Dork?
Marisha: Didn't seem to know a lot. They're simple-minded beasts.
Laura: Dork the ox.
Marisha: Yeah, poor Dork. Dork the ox.
Matt: Rest in peace, Dork.
Travis: Pour a little out.
Matt: You guys make your way. You wait a while, a good two-hour period, as cows, before eventually you, keeping your eye to the sky with your arrow nocked, see a whisk of shadow across the moonlight.
Laura: (whistles)
Travis: What was that?
Laura: I'm letting you guys fucking know there's a thing in the sky.
Orion: Is it Jumanji time?
Sam: Not quite.
Matt: At this point, you guys look up, and you see something circle once. It looks like a bird. It's just not as big as you were expecting. Looks like a bigger hawk.
Orion: I cast Stoneskin on myself.
Matt: Okay. Bigger and bigger
Liam: My cow is going stealth.
Matt: Roll for cow stealth! (laughter)
Liam: 23.
Matt: Okay. You're still a cow.
Marisha: I make myself look available. I step away from the rest of the herd a little bit.
Travis: I go into a cow rage and start chewing faster.
Matt: You would like to chew! All right.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark it.
Matt: Okay. Well, it has to come within range first.
Laura: As soon as it is.
Matt: As it swoops down, you see this bird just gets larger and larger and you realize it was quite a distance away. And now that it's getting closer, the tales you've heard are true. This is at least a 100-foot wing span, if not more.
Orion: I'm going to fix my ring on it.
Marisha: 100-foot wing span?
Orion: As it gets close I'm going to brace my ring as it's coming towards us.
Matt: Okay. It comes. It dives down with extreme speed and goes into a dive. It comes into range. You cast Hunter's Mark on it. You have your ring ready. What you doing?
Orion: Cast Slow on it!
Matt: Cast Slow? All righty. What is the DC on that?
Orion: 17.
Matt: And what is the save?
Sam: Is it wisdom or charisma or something?
Orion: It's concentration! No, wait, it is a concentration.
Matt: Yes it is. That's okay. I'm finding it. All right, it is wisdom. All right. Oh! What was the DC?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17. That is an 18. Rolled a natural 18 on that one. As it swoops down, you release the spell, you are immediately attempting to be grasped in its talons. That is a 23 to hit.
Marisha: That hits.
Matt: All right. So you then take 23 points of slashing damage to your cow form.
Laura: I thought we were just--
Matt: Oh. Okay. Sorry. You're not in cow form, are you? You're illusioned. You're staying normal?
Marisha: No, I'm normal.
Matt: You're normal. Right. Okay. I thought you were saying you were doing an actual cow form, but no. All right. You take 23 points of slashing damage, and you are currently grappled as it takes right back up into the air, clutching Keyleth within its talons.
Liam: How fast can the rest of us do anything? It's gone?
Matt: Now you guys can react. It is currently 60 feet away from you.
Laura: I immediately-- oh god! I shoot it.
Sam: Do we have to roll for initiative?
Matt: You do.
Laura: But I was notched already.
Matt: Right. I'll give you advantage on your initiative. Because you're notched but you used your last turn to cast Hunter's Mark on it. Everyone roll initiative. You have advantage on it because you were nocked, and because you were ready to react, you have advantage on your initiative check, but everyone else just roll normally. All right. So that is 25 to 20?
Laura: 21.
Matt: 21.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Liam: 17.
Travis: 18.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: Vax. Keyleth. Scanlan? Tiberius? What you guys got?
Sam: Six.
Orion: Five.
Matt: Okay. All right. So Vex, you're up first.
Laura: I'm going to shoot it through the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay. Go for it. Roll for the attack.
Laura: 16.
Matt: 16 hits.
Laura: (counts quietly) 26.
Matt: 26 points of damage. All righty.
Laura: And then I'm going to shoot it again.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: That one definitely hits  26.
Matt: Yeah! That hits.
Laura: 26 again.
Matt: Nice! All right, that brings us to Grog.
Travis: I take the Firebrand Warhammer, activate it, turn on the fire. And I put the Chain of Returning on it and throw it at the winged beast.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll with disadvantage because it's already roughly 40 to 60 feet away from you. It's tough to get there. But you can try.
Travis: 15. Nope. 16.
Matt: Okay. Due to its distance and the dark cover of night, it's harder to hit and you actually swing and throw it and the hammer-- The chain goes taut and it just drops to the ground and it's just out of range of the hammer, as it escapes the range it would have hit it with.
Travis: Can I pull it back?
Matt: Yeah, go for it. That's easy enough, it's not wedged in anything. You don't have to roll for it. All right, so that's your turn. Vax.
Liam: I'd like to use a bonus action to click Boots of Haste together, and I think if I do that, I have two actions at that point, right?
Matt: No. Well you do have an additional action that can be used only to attack.
Liam: Just attack. So what I want to do is click the Boots of Haste together, use the original action to run as far as I can towards the bird, and then use my final action to sneak attack the thing since it's got Keyleth in its talons. That's up to you.
Matt: Okay. The sneak attack will not kick in because Keyleth is not threatening the creature. But you go for the attacks. You rush up, you dash, you get underneath it-- for a moment, because of the Boots of Haste, you keep speed with this giant, darting creature. You, underneath, throw your daggers upward.
Liam: All right. It would just be one-- I mean if I use the dash to run as far as I can, that would leave me with one attack probably?
Matt: One attack and your bonus without the damage bonus.
Liam: I'm trying to be a Boy Scout here. Wouldn't the Boots of Haste clicking be the bonus action? Yeah. That is 22 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: All right. And that's not a whole lot.
Matt: What's the range increment on a dagger?
Liam: That's ten. Ten.
Matt: Ten?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Dagger. Roll again for disadvantage because it's just within your secondary throwing range.
Liam: Oh yeah. Then I missed.
Matt: Okay. It vanishes into the dark night ahead of you. So yeah. That is gone. You still have your Belt of Returning, you just don't have your snake belt. Yeah, don't worry guys. I saw the look on your face and I'm like, no, it's fine. It comes back. Okay. Keyleth, you're up. You're currently grappled and held within the talons of this giant bird. You see the entire ground below you.
Marisha: Judging by the fairly close up appearance I have of him at this point, can I tell it is probably a "beast" nature?
Matt: At the sheer size, it's hard to tell. You've never encountered a beast of this size, but you do look up and you can see the talons that are currently holding you in place and piercing the sides of your armor are bird-like talons. And you do see a series of dark feathers coating the entire underbelly of this entity.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to attempt to cast Dominate Beast.
Matt: Okay. All right.
Marisha: It has to make a wisdom saving throw.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Is your Enhance Ability still active? From before?
Matt: That's for ability checks. So you finish casting the spell. Apparently, this entity is not affected by the spell.
Liam: Fuck-sticks.
Sam: It's not a beast?
Matt: It is not a beast. There's a fine line when certain creatures of nature are altered by some sort of magical essence or their nature perhaps is not natural at the get-go. Either they were created or over time they became something beyond beast. This seems to fall under that category.
Marisha: That's my turn, right?
Matt: That's your turn. That brings us to its turn.
Marisha: Can I try and break the grapple as a bonus action?
Matt: That would be your action to try and break the grapple. For this creature's turn, it does a full double dash of its full flight speed and is about 250 feet away from you and completely out of your guys' reach. You see it (whoosh) up into the sky, disappearing to the north, north-northwest area beyond Emon, carrying Keyleth in its claws.
Liam: Keyleth, just get out of its fucking hands and fall. You can change. We'll catch you; we'll do something! Just fall.
Matt: You're close enough where you can still hear this, as the desperation kicks in and you realize-- seeing your whole party not even visible at this point except a couple of dark dots in the low light of the night.
Sam: Is it our turn yet?
Matt: It now comes to Scanlan's turn.
Sam: Okay. I Dimension Door.
Matt: What's the range on Dimension Door?
Sam: 500 feet.
Matt: You-- and appear where? Where do you want to appear?
Sam: On it. On its back.
Matt: Okay. You appear right on its back. You immediately land and start sliding back as the wind is pushing on you. The feathers themselves, due to the aerodynamic nature of its flight path; it's a lot of wind resistance against you.
Liam: Oh, make an acrobatics check.
Orion: Shush! What the hell?!
Matt: No, I was going there. Don't worry. That's what it is. You need to go ahead and make an acrobatics check to see if you can maintain balance on the back of this beast.
Liam: My intelligence is not six!
Sam: 20!
Matt: You manage to just, you tumble backward a little bit. You grab a couple of feathers and get yourself just on the side underneath where the wing meets part of the upper torso, where the wind resistance is the least amount, and you manage to hold on. You are now clutching the back of this giant bird. That's your turn.
Sam: Okay. As my bonus action, I will inspire Keyleth. Right? She's right next to me?
Marisha: Scanlan? What the shit?
Sam: (singing) The way you kick so much ass like nobody else. The way you do animal things gets me overwhelmed. You don't know. You don't know you're powerful. Oh. That's what makes you powerful.
Matt: Due to the wind, you don't hear the last line. It's too loud around it. However, you can take a d10 inspiration dice.
Laura: Yay!
Marisha: Yay!
Liam: What a heroic move! Amazing!
Matt: Which for the record, this currently right now looks like-- you see the cow clutched below, and currently there is a cow holding onto this giant bird.
Sam: It lasts eight hours.
Matt: This singing tiny cow. You artists out there, have fun with this scene. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. Tiberius.
Orion: Good. I drop Stoneskin. At 5th-level, I go myself, one, two, three-- I cast Fly on all of us. Fly, you fools! And go right after them.
Matt: All right. All of you guys, at that point you see Tiberius and you all take off after him.
Liam: The cows take off into the night sky.
Orion: (shouting) Fly, Vox Machina! Moo!
Marisha: Vox "Moo-china!" (booing)
Matt: A squadron of weirdly-sized, flying cows lit by moonlight, chasing after a giant bird. I love Dungeons and Dragons. (laughter)
Travis: What is this?
Matt: What's the flying speed on Fly?
Orion: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet. Cool.
Orion: I'm going to dash. On that.
Matt: Yep. You guys can go 120 feet every turn. It can go 240. Two rounds pass before you guys realize there is no way you're going to catch up with this thing or get even close to it.
Liam: I've got Haste!
Laura: I've got Hunter's Mark on it, so I can track it.
Liam: Double me, yo! I got Haste.
Matt: Your Haste speed-- your physical body doesn't affect the Fly spell, unfortunately. You're only at the speed that the arcane nature of the spell can take you. I'm just saying. Your metabolism's real fast. Your heartbeat's hummingbirding it. But you're still only going 120 feet. So as you guys follow behind, you can see now, after a while on the edge of the shoreline, not too far from Emon-- maybe what would normally be from horseback or a brisk walk, a half day's travel-- you eventually come upon the-- There it is! You come upon the coastal mountains known as the Shoreline Summit. It's a series of unusually steep mountain bluffs that hug the coastline, northwest of Emon. As you get closer, and at this point you've lost sight of the bird. Scanlan, I want you to go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Sam: Athletics? Well, that doesn't count. That's not good. Athletics? 16.
Matt: 16? Okay. You still manage to keep hold for the portion of the length of the journey. As it moves and shifts and the wind itself is still blowing in your face, though minimized by your current positioning. It's a trial to hold onto this large creature as it makes its wings beat and just the sheer force of its movement. All right. So as you get closer to these mountaintops--
Marisha: Do I have a turn yet?
Matt: You can go ahead and take your turn now too, yes.
Marisha: Yeah? I cast Polymorph on it. You're on it.
Sam: Don't worry about me!
Marisha: Really?
Sam: I'm fine! You never need to worry about me. Haven't you guys learned that by now? I'm fine!
Marisha: Out of thematic reasons, I also turn him into a cow. (laughter)
Sam: That's amazing!
Liam: Is what she cries out heroically.
Matt: Okay. What's the DC on this?
Marisha: My spell DC? 18.
Matt: Rolled a one. (laughter)
Sam: I'm a cow on a cow with a cow!
Matt: So this giant flying bird-- Moo! And just begins to plummet at an extremely fast speed. You both immediately are released from its grasp. Scanlan and Keyleth both are just falling. You guys don't see this. It's too far away from you now. At this point, you're probably close to about 500 feet in the air.
Liam: Yo, I heard you liked cows, so I gave you some cows with your cow.
Matt: I hope this inspires the next Diablo Cow level, guys. You really need to look into this. All right. So you guys are now both plummeting and falling at a really, really rapid speed.
Marisha: I go eagle form.
Matt: Flailing cows. You go eagle form. You're fine. So you go into eagle form. That's your action this turn. That's your bonus action, because you can do that as a--
Marisha: As a bonus action!
Matt: Eagle form. Scanlan, you plummet full speed on this one. You probably have another two rounds before you impact with something very painful.
Liam: But he's as heavy as a dust mote, so he just goes like this all the way down. Right?
Marisha: I don't think that's how it works.
Orion: No, he's a little pebble.
Marisha: I can catch him, if you need catched.
Matt: You guys still continue to give chase. Eventually, you see this giant thing just go and vanish from sight. It's just gone. It just disappeared.
Orion: I go full Gandalf.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Never go full Gandalf.
Matt: You guys are pushing forward. So it's now the next round for you guys to react. What are you doing?
Sam: I will become a pterodactyl.
Matt: So you're casting?
Sam: Polymorph on myself?
Matt: Okay. Because you are falling and this is a lot of wind, I'm going to have to ask you to make a concentration check to complete the spell.
Laura: Come on, Scanlan!
Matt: So go ahead and roll a d20.
Sam: This is a concentration not on holding a spell, but on casting it?
Matt: Correct. Because as part of the components of it and maintaining your attention to the spell--
Marisha: What does he add? His spell attack bonus?
Matt: This? No, this is a d20 and-- let me make sure, yeah-- it's a d20 and then you add your plus five from your charisma.
Sam: Charisma? That's a natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: With that-- (screeches) pterodactyl.
Liam: Tables have turned, motherfucker! Tables have turned!
Orion: You're both flying cows!
Laura: Wait! Was Seeming a concentration?
Orion: I think it lasts for like eight hours.
Laura: Did it drop? Are we no longer cows?
Sam: I think so. I'll check.
Liam: Hey! You're not a cow anymore!
Laura: Oh my god, you're not a cow anymore!
Liam: Oh! Awesome!
Matt: You guys keep flying. You guys catch yourselves.
Sam: Nope, not concentration. It just lasts for eight hours.
Matt: You guys are all still flying cows. You're all still just a squadron of flying, illusory cows, which you guys are both now transformed into an eagle and a pterodactyl, but you still look like cows. (laughter)
Liam: As the twins are flying, I say, hey, did you notice we have the same pattern? Twins!
Matt: About this time, you hear a loud, impactful boom. And there's a cloud of dust partway into the side of this first bit of mountain range that you come upon, a little bit distant from you guys.
Laura: Can I fly down towards it?
Matt: You start heading in that direction. Because of the speed it was traveling at and the way it was carrying at the speed it was going, it's still ahead of you guys. And you see the impact. You hear this loud screeching sound and you see now where there was a little poof of cloud, these wings unfold and (flapping) make its way back up.
Orion: How far away from it are we?
Matt: You guys right now at the close to six minutes you've been traveling--
Marisha: Did it not drop the cow to 0 hit points?
Matt: All the damage carries over.
Liam: The remainder of that damage went into its hit points.
Matt: You don't know. It looks hurt. It looks like it wasn't happy about it. It continues back up. From you Tiberius, it's probably close to 700 to 800 feet away from you. It's because of the speed it was traveling and the speed you guys were following. It was gaining on you every single turn.
Laura: Is it flying away from us now?
Matt: It's heading up into the mountain range.
Liam: Fly after that motherfucker!
Laura: Should we still track it? It's still nighttime, right?
Matt: It's still nighttime, yeah.
Orion: It's only 500 feet away from me right now?
Matt: 600 to 500 feet.
Orion: Okay, cool. Well I'm going for it, still.
Matt: What are you doing?
Laura: We're all following it.
Orion: Where am I? It's taking off right now and I'm over here?
Matt: You're back here. It's now starting to take off and head up towards the top of this mountain range that you're just starting to come upon.
Orion: Okay. If it's doing that, then I'll fucking go higher and try to meet it where it's going.
Matt: Okay. Cool. The rest of you guys continue to give chase. Now that it's returned to its form, it travels an additional double dash: 240 feet. As this progresses, it's far beyond any of you guys in a matter of seconds.
Laura: Is the mountain range really far away?
Matt: No, you've just hit the outskirts of the mountain range. It got there first. You guys just catch up to where it starts and you see it's like now it's dodging through the mountains and is currently no longer in sight. There is a little bit of low cloud cover in this area. A couple drift by and cover a couple of the mountains. But this little cluster of seaside cliffs and mountains, as you get closer, you can see it's dotted with high altitude trees. There's precariously perched goats that are sleeping on elements of the sides of this mountain.
Liam: Can you track it?
Laura: I can track it! Of course.
Matt: So you're keeping your attention on it?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: The winds also are pretty strong as you get close to the mountains. As you coast around each, you start actually diving into this middle valley area.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Does that affect any spells?
Laura: No, it just makes us stealth easier.
Sam: It doesn't drop Hunter's Mark?
Matt: Is it concentration?
Laura: No, it's not concentration; it's an action. Oh wait. (laughs) I don't know if I can tell.
Matt: Is Pass Without a Trace concentration?
Laura: Where does it say it?
Sam: There's a C next to it somewhere.
Laura: Oh, never mind! It's a concentration. Forget it! I don't know how these things work yet.
Sam: Yeah, stick to the bows and arrows.
Matt: Traveling through this area, you can see the mountains. The way that they're constructed in this area, it's not a gradual crag. A lot of these are just punched up in the air, like whatever heavy seismic force that created these initially was very localized and very powerful. A lot of the mountains are spire-like. They come up with very sheer sides and you can see why this mountain range is largely not utilized or traversed or generally spoken of often because it's too dangerous for most average folk to even attempt to climb or use for any good reason. The winds are high and powerful here at the tops, as well. And as you're flying around, the winds blowing across, and you get pushed off your course a little bit here and there, but you still keep up, best as possible. You leading the charge. Over about five minutes of searching through this mountain range, you sense that its movement eventually comes to stop.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: There's a nest.
Sam: Wait, you sense that he came to a stop?
Laura: He came to a stop a little bit ahead of us.
Sam: Let's go get him.
Laura: Can we all try to stealth in?
Sam: I'm a pterodactyl, so--
Marisha: Yeah, let's go for the element of surprise. Well, technically, we're all still cows.
Matt: Yes. And you guys cannot talk because you're actually in creature forms.
Laura: All right. Well, I'm going to try to stealth. Mountains are my favored terrain!
Matt: They are! Do you want to go onto the mountain itself, or are you still flying amongst them?
Laura: Oh, I'll still fly.
Matt: So you would not get the advantage because air is not your favored terrain. So everyone who wishes to, go ahead and roll stealth checks
Marisha: All of us?
Matt: All of you who wish to try and come at it from a quiet--
Sam: (pterodactyl screech)
Matt: What did you roll?
Liam: With advantage, I rolled a two.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm not used to being flying, really.
Sam: Five.
Orion: Are we flying anymore?
Matt: You guys are all still flying, yeah.
Orion: Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, no.
Marisha: 21.
Travis: 14.
Laura: 28.
Matt: Yeah, so. You guys following behind Vex, many of you clumsily and some of you shouting out to each other, "I think she sees it this way." And you're like, "oh my god." You come around this one bend and you can see one of the larger mountainous spires that has a lot of trees and green growth towards the top at certain places where the rock juts out and gives a shelf for such greenery to grow, outside of its sheer outside surface. You do see a couple of wings fold in against the moonlight in what looks to be an outcropping. And there are multiple layers of rock shelves on the side of this mountain. And on one of these outcroppings, there appears to be some sort of a nest: a cluster of almost like actual trees and pieces of wood that are all jammed into this giant nest that's nestled against where the shadow and the moonlight are fighting for some sort of visual on it.
Travis: Big-ass tree fortress.
Laura: Did we just find like a mama bird and baby birds?
Marisha: Yeah, we did.
Laura: What are we going to do?
Liam: We're going to take out the mom and train the babies.
Sam: What are we going to do?
Liam: Yeah. We're going to capture those babies and we're going to train them.
Orion: That's a good idea. I like that idea.
Sam: Like Avatar?
Orion: Yes.
Travis: You could go in.
Laura: Me go in? There's a giant fucking nest here! I get close to it. As close as I feel safe getting to it.
Matt: You guys all stay back or do you go with her?
Orion: I'm going to cast Greater Invisibility on myself and then follow.
Matt: Okay. You guys have 12 seconds before you all plummet.
Orion: Oh wait! No! I don't do that. Damn it! I forget we're still flying.
Travis: What part of the flying part did you forget?
Orion: I thought we'd landed already.
Matt: Are you guys all going with Vex, or are you all staying back and she's going on her own?
Travis: Are we going to lose Fly, or do we keep it?
Matt: Are you casting Greater Invisibility?
Orion: No.
Matt: Then no, you're fine.
Liam: Is it the same stealth roll or an additional stealth roll to go forward at this point?
Matt: No this was your stealth roll on approaching.
Liam: Oh. Well, I mean, I knew I rolled shitty.
Matt: You don't know you rolled shitty.
Travis: I'm going in.
Matt: All right. So Vex and Grog, you approach. Gliding cows, drifting through the night sky.
Laura: This is so stupid.
Travis: Hoof in hoof.
Matt: Okay, yeah. So you guys all realize you must keep close together to Tiberius as you come in. Keeping too much of a distance would be a bad thing. You come upon the underneath portion of this outcropping, and you can see within a quick glance-- go ahead and make a perception check, all of you guys.
Marisha: All of us?
Matt: All of you who are coming up in this cluster.
Travis: Three.
Laura: Do I get an advantage because we're in a mountain environment at all?
Matt: Nope. Actually no. Because you're seeing things on a mountain, I will give you advantage on this.
Laura: Yes!
Marisha: 12.
Matt: 12?
Orion: 16.
Sam: Nothing.
Liam: 13.
Laura: 12.
Matt: So the highest was?
Orion: 16.
Matt: 16. You got?
Travis: Three.
Matt: As you guys all look up, it's very shadowy over here. It's hard to see. The moonlight's in your eye a little bit and the darkness is so pitch. The umbra of this particular shadow is very dark and crushed. You make out, in the nest, the large bird creature has folded its wings and is currently leaning down. And you see something in the nest that's much smaller moving up next to it.
Marisha: I don't want to kill a mama.
Laura: But she's killing the farmers' stuff.
Marisha: Maybe we can transplant her.
Sam: To a wildlife preserve?
Laura: Maybe. And her babies?
Marisha: Capture her and move her away from town?
Liam: That seems complicated.
Sam: Are they on the highest peak?
Matt: No. There's two other levels up above this. This one just is one of the largest outcroppings.
Sam: I'm going to swoop up over them. See if there's any boulders to drop.
Matt: Okay. Looking over it, there are no loose rocks or boulders. In fact, because of the construction of these mountains, they're solid spires that jut up and then abruptly end. All the erosion that happens here appears to be gradual enough-- that's why the sides of the mountains are so smooth and unclimbable.
Marisha: So there's a sheer peak and they're nested on the side of it?
Matt: Yeah. It's a sheer peak that rounds off at the very top and there are little outcroppings that jut out in places as it goes down. But those are more towards the top, and as you go down further-- as most of the erosion hits the mountain lower and lower, it has carved off or destroyed most of what would have been previous outcroppings, or smoothed them over.
Travis: How far away are we now?
Matt: You guys are probably a good 60 or 50 feet if you're trying to get up within range of your Fly. Right? What's the range of on that? Fly?
Sam: Fly? Oh, here.
Matt: I got it. No! There is no range on it. You just touch them. So you're fine. Yeah. As long as you're concentrating on it, you're fine.
Travis: So we're within 60 feet?
Matt: Well, you guys have been keeping a little more of a distance down here. However, at this point, as you guys are all encroaching and Scanlan's gone overhead, a voice rings out against the darkness, "Flying cows? Really? I care not for this insolence. If you've come to mock me or fight me, do it now! Or leave this creature alone!"
Laura: What? Where are you? Who are you? Who said that?
Orion: I rolled an arcana check of 17 of my surroundings-- where it's coming from.
Laura: Ditto. I try to perceive where it's coming from.
Matt: Okay. Arcana check-- there's nothing arcane in nature. It's not omnipresent or coming from any certain place. There is a direction it's coming from, which is from the outcropping or nest area. There's nothing arcane in nature to it. It's in the shadow. You can't really see it from this distance.
Laura: Is it in front of us? To the side of us? Is it coming from where the bird seems to be?
Matt: It's coming from where the bird is.
Liam: He's controlling it.
Marisha: I fly over as an eagle.
Laura: You still look like a cow eagle.
Marisha: Can we drop Seeming?
Matt: It's not under your control, and you can't talk, too.
Travis: Okay. I yell out, you've been stealing the farmers' livestock. Give us a reason not to kill you.
Sam: That's good. That's good. Diplomacy.
Orion: Or, I mean, moo!
Matt: Okay. You guys are all keeping distance from it? The voice comes out again, "Your nature confuses me and your words seem ill-informed. If you're not going to come to speak of discourse, I'm going to assume that that you're my enemy."
Orion: Then, as he's saying that, I'll approach.
Matt: So Tiberius cow goes.
Orion: And as I approach the thing, I'm going to Dispel Magic on myself.
Matt: Okay. Cool. For Dispel Magic, I need you to go ahead, just for the sake of this-- I won't consider it contested because you're allies in this thing. So you land. Tiberius' form shimmers and returns back to that of a dragonborn, and you're standing there on the precipice. Go ahead and roll a perception check.
Orion: What is that? 11.
Matt: Okay. It's hard to make out the details, but the voice is definitely coming from the nest. You see there is something vaguely humanoid, but it's hard to make out the shape at this distance with this low light, especially since you aren't a darkvision-gifted entity. However, it's close to this bird creature.
Orion: I'm going to say, is this big bird thing asleep?
Matt: "You will not harm this creature, poachers!"
Orion: I'm not trying to harm it at all. I'm just seeing if it's fine. If we could talk. I can't see anything, and I wanted to cast Light so I could see something, but I don't want to hurt your bird's eyes.
Matt: You can see the bird's moving and it's looking towards your direction. And it has this like (soft snarl).
Orion: So it's awake?
Matt: It's awake, and it looks hurt. The voice is like, "You come here masqueraded as whatever manner of beasts that you are--"
Orion: Cows. We were cows.
Matt: "After tormenting and severely wounding this beautiful creature."
Orion: We didn't do anything to the creature. No, we were-- This creature was stealing the farmer's cows, and the farmers were saying, "You've taken our livestock," which is hurting the farm. We came to help them and we posed as cows, and then your bird took our--
Liam: While he's blithering, can I make an additional cow stealth check?
Matt: To?
Liam: To come up behind the guy. Near him. Not even near him. Just to get a better vantage point.
Matt: Go for it. Make it with a disadvantage.
Liam: Does that cancel out with my advantage from my cloak?
Laura: A cow in a cloak.
Matt: You are a flying cow in the moonlight against an individual that is very aware of your presence.
Liam: Shut up, baby, I know it. (laughter)
Liam: That is good.
Laura: That's 31.
Liam: Yeah. 31.
Matt: (chuckles) You stealthily cow your way up to the side of this precipice. Seemingly unnoticed. Getting a view of this creature now, you can see this nest is a cluster of driftwood and chunks of shipwreck and carts and wagon wheels and whatever pieces of wood have been scavenged from different time periods. Some are weathered, some are more fresh. And trees, whole trees that are broken and shredded have all been cobbled together to make this nest. In the center of this-- I'm going to take the intensity down on this a little bit-- you see, there up against this bird-- and the bird itself is twitching and looks like it's hurt. Not deeply hurt, but hurt. You see a small humanoid. Pretty small. Scanlan small. Hard to make out details, but it is currently in the process of doing a repeated hand motion and then touching. A hand motion and then touching. And you've seen this motion before.
Liam: Touching what?
Matt: Touching the bird. There is a perpetual string of Cure Wounds being applied to this bird.
Marisha: I also approach and come out of my eagle form.
Orion: Light.
Sam: Are you landing somewhere?
Marisha: Next to Tiberius.
Orion: But I'm going to block it with my hand so it's not going to blind the bird.
Matt: Okay.  As the light picks up, you can see the bird turns away for a second and starts to like flap its wings instinctually. And once again, seeing it up close, this bird is really big. The humanoid entity becomes immediately visible. And it is a gnome. You can see, he's dressed in hides and roughly crafted leather and furs. He has tousled, greasy black hair that hangs past his shoulders, covering a bedraggled and bearded face. Holding up his arm-- and looks thin. It's covering the light and he's like, "You!"
Orion: Sorry. I tried to not blind you. It was very dark. I'm sorry. Hello. We mean you no harm.
Matt: The gnome slams this small wooden, for lack of a better term, a small staff or cane. Slams it into the ground with a foot stomp and you can see the gnome's entire body suddenly begin to shift and change into this dark, gnarled-looking, hard surface.
Liam: I whack him in the back of the head.
Laura: No! It's just Barkskin! It's just defense!
Matt: He doesn't know. All right. So you cow stealth up to the side of this guy.
Liam: Let's get ready to rumble.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make an attack.
Liam: I pause.
Matt: You pause? You are currently now crouched right behind the edge of this nest, and you can't even actually see the guy anymore because in order to get up there, you've come underneath to stay hidden and you're just there behind.
Marisha: Can I see Vax?
Matt: No. Well, actually go ahead and roll a perception check. Is it higher than a 31?
Marisha: Is it higher than a 31? No.
Matt: You have no idea where Vax is.
Sam: I'm way up above them still, right? Do I see anything?
Matt: No, actually. You see, there's another section above there. It looks like there's nothing else of interest, other than some growth, a few bushes, and some vines that hang down the side.
Travis: Somebody talk to him before I kill this fucking bird.
Orion: I am talking to him.
Marisha: I land beside Tiberius and come out of eagle form. Tiberius, would you please Dispel this cow form from me. Please? Thank you.
Matt: Okay. And with that, you cast Dispel Magic and Keyleth's form reverts that to Keyleth. Normal Keyleth. Non-cow Keyleth. The gnome character now has the staff at the back and has a hand in front and is like, (panting).
Marisha: Are you a druid? I'm also a druid. I think our goals might be aligned.
Matt: "Really?"
Marisha: It's okay. What's her name?
Matt: "This creature has no name to it yet. I, myself, am a protector of the wild, as you claim to be, as well. I have no tribe but the trees around me. I hear the whisper of the wind, and it calls for justice."
Marisha: I can relate to that.
Matt: "Then why do you follow? Why do you insist on harming this creature?"
Marisha: Because we were seeking justice for other people.
Matt: "Why? For the civilized folk of the city? You should know more than most. They sit there, taking beautiful creatures of nature, making them fat and formless and worth nothing. To slaughter them without life and purpose to their existence."
Orion: The life and purpose of their existence is to keep those other people alive.
Matt: "And why is it not the same with this creature? If they cannot guard their livestock, why is it not food for this thing, as well? It is the natural life cycle that they've removed themselves from."
Orion: When one has an establishment, when one grows its own crop, and one steals something, it is considered a crime.
Matt: "Well, when one is not part of that civilization, but the civilization of the world as a whole, which requires hunting for what keeps you alive, perhaps that does not sink or hang on my conscience."
Orion: Fair point.
Marisha: Let's not let this escalate. Okay? What is your name?
Matt: "I was once called Byron."
Marisha: Vyron?
Matt: "Byron."
Marisha: Byron.
Matt: "I have not heard my name nor spoken words for many years."
Orion: Would you not like to be called Byron, or would you like something else, like B-roy or B-man? My name's Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia. And this is my friend Keyleth, who is also a druid. And we also have a friend who is a gnome who sings songs and whatnot.
Matt: The bird, now looking of much better health than it was when it arrived, now flutters its wings out in a stretching motion. And as it does, its head glides down and looks right towards you. This giant beak that looks like it could snap you in two with a single bite.
Marisha: I reach up to it and reach out to pet its beak.
Matt: I'm going to ask you to make an animal handling check on this. Just to see where this goes.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I gently start swooping down to check on my friends.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: All right. The large bird-type creature retracts from your attempted touch and begins to rear back into the nest in a defensive position. Doesn't bite your hand off.
Marisha: I kneel down a bit. Produce a few Goodberries. Reach out.
Sam: Bye, Keyleth. This is how we lose one of our members. Feeding a bird.
Matt: The creature leans forward and the giant bird, you can see its dark, black eyes staring at you. Each eye probably about the size of your torso. As the giant beak comes down, you can see the moonlight gliding off the smooth exterior of the dark black beak. It smells. And you take 27 points of piercing damage as the animal takes the Goodberries and almost your entire hand with it, as well. At that size, it's hard to be gentle.
Marisha: It's okay. It's all right.
Matt: So you retract your hand, which is now essentially in many ways, bones are broken, feels like. There's blood streaming down the side of your hand, and (dripping).
Marisha: That's a good girl.
Sam: Is it?
Matt: Swallows.
Sam: Is it a good girl?
Orion: I'm feeding a tiny snack to Lockheed.
Marisha: I turn back to Byron--
Sam: And say, ow.
Marisha: Yeah, and go, that hurt. Now. Please listen to me. Please, please listen to me. We did come here to kill the giant creature.
Matt: "I had assumed."
Marisha: But upon seeing the situation, upon approach, realized the situation and decided amongst all of us that we did not want to bring such a great creature to its death.
Matt: Scanlan, you've landed by now. A pterodactyl. A cow-looking pterodactyl.
Orion: As he swoops, I've never seen anything quite like it.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Orion: I'm going to aid her, too.
Sam: All I've seen so far is Keyleth's bloody hand.
Marisha: 20 total.
Matt: You have advantage on this because Tiberius is aiding you on this conversation.
Marisha: I'll take that 20 total.
Matt: All right. He looks at you. "Well, shall you leave us, then?"
Marisha: Under one condition.
Matt: "There's always a condition. You call yourself a druid, yet you speak like the civilized folk. I get the feeling that perhaps your connection to nature has not been tended to for some time."
Orion: No, she really knows her stuff. I mean, we just fought this fire guy--
Marisha: Just because one can appreciate nature, does not mean that one cannot also appreciate humanity.
Matt: "Well, this beautiful creature is the only surviving young of a clutch, bred by a majestic roc high in the Cliffkeep Mountains. Its mother now lies dead, slain by the brutal giants that wander those peaks. This young'un is all that remains of that clutch and the memory of that blessed entity."
Travis: That's a young'un?
Matt: This is a young one. "This new home serves us well. Abundance of feed. Lack of large, predatory creatures. I believe this is where we'll stay."
Marisha: Question. If this is a young, adolescent creature, what do you think of the destruction it could cause once it reaches full adulthood? Are you okay with having that on your conscience? This creature could result in the lives of many. If you relocate out of town, just a few miles. Say like 50 or 100 or so because this thing's really damn big. So I'm sure it's got a pretty big-- you know what I mean.
Orion: Or just the other way.
Marisha: I will help you. I will personally come with you and tend to their safety. And make sure that their location is proper and safe, and handled with respect. Then you will be out of the harms of poachers. You can live off the land, and you can be free and alone.
Matt: "Do you think we came straight to this mountain range? Do you think this is the first nest we've constructed? Me and this lone survivor have scoured the length of this side of Tal'Dorei. This, as far as I can see, is the safest. It's the most ignored by nearby civilization."
Marisha: Listen--
Sam: I'm going to drop Seeming and also drop my form of pterodactyl.
Matt: All of you now, your forms change. As this happens mid-sentence, it's noticed immediately by the gnome druid, who's like (gasps).
Marisha: Yes! That is correct. Listen. We are being nice. Don't think that we will be the first. You will have more people come and hunt you and kill this, as this beast continues. How long do you think you can survive waves of mercenaries coming to try and kill this? We are the nice ones. I suggest you heed our warning, take our help, and save the life of you and your creature in the long run.
Matt: "You have yet to provide a suitable alternative."
Orion: Oh! I might have an idea.
Marisha: There is an alternative. Tiberius can tell you of that alternative.
Orion: Yes! See, your creature is rather large and powerful, yes? You have a rather strong bond with him, which is quite unique with such a unique looking creature.
Marisha: I was setting you up for an awesome one-liner, man! You were supposed to be like, the other option is death.
Liam: Ask him if he's considered Whitestone?
Orion: Whitestone? Yeah! Well, I guess there's a couple of options, really. There's this town Whitestone that's pretty great and has a lot of livestock that this creature can consume.
Marisha: Yeah, I don't know about that.
Matt: Go ahead and make a deception check.
Orion: That is a 24.
Matt: "Whitestone. How far is this Whitestone?"
Marisha: Wait! No! Hang on! No! This is getting out of control already. I will not let you all do this! No! Not today. You guys have caused enough problems. We are not going to push this creature on other people. I'm trying, all right? I'm working on it. I don't want to push this problem off on a town that's already being held hostage by vampires. That fucking sucks! That's double shitting on them.
Orion: Well, the other option was, like I was saying, perhaps you can form an agreement with Emon. I'm sure it would pay in livestock rather well for the protection of you, such a powerful druid, over at least a section of the land. In exchange for free food for your friend.
Matt: "You, dragon man, are adorably naive of the ways of men and those that lie and deceive. I have yet to have met any civilized people who have kept their word when it came to creatures like this."
Laura: Can I come forward? All right. What about Vasselheim? Not in the city, but outside of it. There's plentiful forests, tons of giant creatures it could feed on.
Orion: That's right! That's true!
Marisha: That actually is fairly true.
Laura: There's so many monsters out there, they don't hunt them all because there's too many.
Orion: That's a wonderful idea, Vex. Yes!
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Orion: I'll aid her, as well.
Matt: I'll say you've aided one person recently. This'll just be her check on this. He really doesn't trust you, given the current circumstances.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Natural 20.
Laura: Then as a natural 20, you know that's good for you. That's the best place you can go. You can see the wisdom in my persuasion.
Orion: It is true, though. I mean, it's just feed walking all around for it.
Marisha: Please, please listen to us. We're only trying to help.
Sam: Is there a young creature around here besides the--
Matt: No, looking about you, no.
Sam: There's no babies there?
Matt: No. This is the young. This bird is like the adolescent.
Marisha: Please believe me. I let this thing almost take my hand off, and I'm still standing here fairly cogently talking to you, so please take that as a sign of honesty.
Laura: I go and put my hand on her back and cast Cure Wounds, because I got that spell now, yo!
Sam: Where are we telling them to go?
Travis: To Vasselheim.
Sam: Vasselheim?
Marisha: Listen. She's right. We have friends in Vasselheim. We can contact the Slayer's Take. We're a part of their guild. We can tell them that you're coming. They'll not bother you. We can tell them they are not allowed to take out a contract on your creature. You will not be harmed.
Laura: Don't bring up contracts, Keyleth. Maybe just don't even bring it up.
Marisha: Because they don't have mercenaries out there. It has to be approved! So it's really good.
Matt: "And what's to stop them from hunting down a majestic creature as rare as this one?"
Orion: Us!
Matt: "You, who live here in Emon?"
Orion: Yes. No, us who are members of the guild.
Matt: "So you also are monster slayers, who come here under the guise to slay this monster?"
Orion: No! Not here. Other places that we're forced to do it. But still we're members.
Matt: "It's too much talk."
Travis: Can we kill this thing now? You guys are doing awesome.
Marisha: I feel like I've done pretty damn good! Come on, man!
Sam: I start speaking in Gnome to him. Listen. Earlier, you said that this place was perfect. It was safe. There were no large predators. Well, you're looking at six large predators. We'll keep hunting you down and hunting your beast down until you get out of here. This is your one and only warning. You must leave, and you must leave now. We're giving you a good choice, a safe choice. We can help you get there and be safe there. But if you don't listen to us, we'll start killing.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Marisha: How many fucking persuasion rolls does this asshole need?
Sam: Persuasion?
Matt: This is essentially a conversational skill challenge. So every success and failure leads towards where the conversation's going to end.
Sam: 32.
Matt: He gives you a look. Very intense, looking into your very essence-type stare. His little beady gnomish eyes meeting yours. (sighs) "If we're going to make this journey to where you say this Vasselheim is, how far is it?"
Sam: Several days' journey.
Laura: It's just across the water. You could fly no problem over it.
Matt: "Across the sea?"
Travis: It's across the sea.
Sam: We can draw you a map. We can give you provisions. We'll even make sure the farmers provide you with a few pieces of livestock to chow down on before the journey. A parting gift to fuel up before the big ride. We can give you papers to hand to the Slayer's Take that will ensure that you'll be treated fairly.
Orion: I'll take out my Scroll of Telescription and start writing a note.
Matt: He looks back towards Keyleth, looks back at Scanlan, looks back at Keyleth, looks up at the bird.
Marisha: Please. We really don't need another death on our conscience today.
Matt: "Then looks like we don't have much of a choice, do we? If you can assure us enough food to get across on this journey, we'll make our way towards this Vasselheim. I pray on the solidarity between our kin, and our kin, that you speak the truth that resonates this moment. Because if it does not, may the fall of this entity and myself weigh on your conscience."
Orion: I flip over the note that I'm writing to him and then I trigger it (flying noise) as he's reading it.
Matt: All right. It (poof) vanishes. "As the sun rises, two sizable pieces of livestock to be placed at the boundaries of the usual hunting site. If those are there, and it is taken without any sort of aggression, we'll take that as a sign that you are being honest, and we shan't bother you or your people any further."
Sam: I bow deeply and when I do, it goes (cowbell ringing).
Matt: For a moment, you think you hear a slight, uncontrollable chuckle from the gnome.
Orion: As that's going on, because we're going to head back right now to seal this up, right? Then I'll do my Teleportation Circle. Which is closer to the northeast: the Lyceum or the Keep?
Matt: To the north side of it? That would be the Lyceum.
Laura: We could fly back pretty fast. Couldn't we?
Matt: If he has another Fly spell, you could take it right back.
Laura: Yeah, we can just fly back.
Marisha: Before he leaves. Well, wait! We've got to go to the farm.
Sam: We've got to go to the farmers. We've got to buy some cows off them.
Marisha: And I tell him, if you're up that way, there's a druidic tribe, a little village called Pyrah. They're Fire Ashari. You can find their headmaster Cerkonos. He's a friend. You might find your people there. Who knows? Maybe friends will do you good.
Matt: "Ashari, you say? My dealings with them have been mixed. Perhaps I'll keep my distance."
Laura: Can I see if there's any feathers dropped from the giant bird creature?
Matt: There are ample around.
Laura: Can I grab a few of them?
Matt: As you go and reach up, slaps you across the knuckles.
Laura: Can I have a feather that he dropped?
Matt: "Why?"
Laura: Because they're beautiful. You have to admit they're beautiful.
Matt: (sighs) "Elves. All right."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: You take three roc feathers.
Travis: They're huge, right?
Matt: Yeah. They're almost boat size.
Orion: I put one in my Bag of Holding, too.
Matt: You guys manage to get one for you and three for you guys before he's like, "Now go! Now! My patience wears thin. I'm through with talking words." (sighs)
Sam: Sorry.
Liam: I walk out from behind him and just walk past.
Matt: (yelps)
Sam: (laughs) Sorry about that.
Orion: All right. I'll burn another 5th-level and then fly us all out.
Matt: Okay. You guys coast back to the north side of Emon. You go to the door where the Klaus family is, and you speak with them for a while. You manage to convince them of the situation and what seems to be a mutually positive circumstance. They agree it's better to lose two cows than continue this.
Laura: I pay them for their two cows. Being nice, man!
Matt: How much do you give them?
Laura: How much are cows usually worth?
Matt: You've never purchased a cow, so you don't know.
Laura: Yes I have! I purchased Dork the ox.
Matt: An ox is not a cow.
Laura: Shit! How much do your cows normally cost, darling?
Matt: This is a good question. Let me look in the book. I've not had to look up the cost of a cow before. I would put it at about maybe 40 gold each.
Laura: That's way more than I expected.
Matt: Because they can be used for meat, they can be used for milk.
Laura: 40 gold each to make up for the loss of your cows.
Matt: "Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate you helping with this. And you promise, this will--"
Sam: Yes, just put them out in the open field.
Travis: We'll take them.
Sam: Oh, we'll take them?
Travis: We'll put them out there. Stake them.
Sam: Okay, we'll take care of it.
Matt: You guys take two of the cows. You bring them to the outskirts. With rope tied around their neck, you essentially hitching-post them to the outside of this open area, about 20 to 30 feet from the actual holding pen. A few hours go by, and the sun slowly begins to rise.
Laura: Along with some other food, right?
Matt: Place some of their feed and things around there. Eventually, the sun begins to rise across the eastern sky. As it crests, you can see some of the farmers come out, anxiously watching from their homes. You see different families gathering. The wings beating in the air, and it swoops down (swoosh) and grabs two of them. You can see some of the families gasp and rush inside, and some are amazed to see this even happen. It takes the two, carries them up, and heads out over the Ozmit Sea, passing to the northwest side, and over the next 30 or so minutes, slowly disappears over the horizon until it's no longer visible.
Travis: The sun rose, right? Can I make a beard check? (laughter)
Matt: You may.
Travis: Two, zero.
Matt: With that, (creak) the beginnings of the other side of your beard slowly begins to set in.
Travis: What happens to the existing side?
Matt: The existing side has rounded itself off to a nice beard. It's pretty much where it's going to be on that side. The other side is now starting to finally catch up. And that's where we'll end: on a successful beard check.
Sam: Wow. That was a crazy night.
Travis: Perspiration was happening.
Marisha: Yeah, it was.
Sam: I gave you my hand.
Matt: More battle maps that will never get used.
Laura: Look at us not fighting things. That's really beautiful.
Matt: That would have been really bad, too.
Laura: I'm glad we didn't fight it.
Travis: Bad for us?
Matt: Well, just imagine a giant bird that grabs you and then drops you off the side of a mountain. Would have been an interesting fight. Cool. That concludes a unique Percy-less bottle episode of Critical Role.
Travis: Squadron of cows.
Matt: Squadron of flying midnight cows. That is probably the weirdest thing that's ever-- no, there's been weirder. That's in the top five of weird things that's happened in DND for me.
Sam: Fighting "formootion." (groaning) [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome everyone, to tonight's episode of Critical Role, a special Halloween edition. My name is Matthew Mercer. I am the dungeon master for this show. This wonderful show, where a bunch of us crazy voice actors get together and roll dice as a bunch of nerdy DND players. So. Welcome. For all the newcomers, I am not normally dressed this insane. We'll be revealing the rest of our cast here in just a moment. But yeah, before we get to that, I wanted to get through some quick announcements overall. Let's see. First and foremost, for those who missed the announcement yesterday: unfortunately, Orion Acaba is no longer with Critical Role going forward. He has his own Twitch channel; he's pushing forward on all of that. Please go and show him support. We wish him the best; much love to him. Just to clarify, too: there's been a lot of speculation stuff like that this was a corporate thing, and people putting all the blame on Geek and Sundry. This was a joint decision between Critical Role and Geek and Sundry-- all parties agreed. Please try and be respectful to everyone involved. Appreciate that. Other things going forward. We have our "How Do You Want To Do This?" shirt up on the website. We put that up last week and announced that, for those who are interested in getting that. Hopefully, they have restocked, because they were sold out really fast. Keep an eye on that and grab one if you're interested. Let's see. Also, today we had Vax'ildan's song playlist on Spotify go live on the website. So you can go watch or listen to "Songs to Stab People To," which is a pretty great little rendition there. Also, my interview went up today on the Geek and Sundry website, so you can go ahead and check out my talk and discussion and Q and A about the show and people involved and go read that and see if it tickles your fancy. [Geralt voice] I feel like I should be doing it like this for the rest of the night.
Travis: Yes, you should!
Matt: Dungeon mastering down here for the remainder. It's a good plan. Let's see. Taliesin, you had an announcement?
Taliesin: I did. Hi, sorry. For those of you on Twitter, you now know what I was just doing. Yes, I'm going to be at Oni Con. I'm flying to Oni Con in Galveston, Texas at 6:30 tomorrow morning. Yay.
Marisha: Yay!
Taliesin: Huzzah. So you can see me at Galveston, Texas between now and Sunday. I'll be there. I'll be rolling around. I'll be a little jetlagged. It'll be great.
Matt: All righty, good announcement. I like it, it's a good announcement. Let's see, next up: Liam, you wanted to mention something?
Liam: Yes, I have two announcements. One, Sam and I have returned to the podcasting scene and released a new episode of All Work No Play. It's been an eight-month hiatus, so that's out; you find that on iTunes and elsewhere, but even bigger than that, I wanted to announce the show's partnership with Wyrmwood Gaming. We are now all using gorgeous custom-made Wyrmwood boxes with character names etched in and all that. They're gorgeous. And if anyone heads over to wyrmwoodgaming.com and uses the coupon code CritRole, then you will get a discount on any purchases you make there from here into perpetuity-- that's not true at all. As long as we're having a good time with Wyrmwood. So thank you, Wyrmwood, for the boxes, and everybody please go check them out.
Laura: What was the code again?
Liam: CritRole. I want to lick mine and make love to it all night long.
Matt: I recommend waiting until after the stream.
Marisha: Yeah. Which one did you get, Liam?
Liam: This is the darkest ebony they have.
Laura: They have all kinds of wood. It's really freaking cool.
Marisha: This is the rosewood?
Travis: I got the unicorn walnut wood.
Matt: Yeah, you did. You're a unicorn.
Travis: I'm getting crumbs in my bosom?
Laura: Yeah, you are, actually.
Liam: It's all good.
Travis: Like cookies in bed.
Taliesin: I do know Sam got Purpleheart. Since he's not here, we can show it.
Travis: He's here. He's just getting ready.
Marisha: Purpleheart.
Matt: Looks fantastic.
Travis: Chicken heart.
Marisha: Chicken heart.
Matt: Oh man. That costume, Travis. I think I mentioned it before-- I'm pretty sure in one of my games we've had a time. (laughs)
Travis: Do I get advantage all night?
Matt: No.
Laura: Do we all get to see what we're dressed as?
Marisha: Yeah, trade me seats for a second, Liam.
Laura: Get out of here, Dread.
Liam: I'll take this.
Matt: There you go. So ladies?
Laura: This is Rat Queens.
Marisha: We're Rat Queens. I'm Violet.
Laura: I'm Hannah. You should check it out. It's an awesome comic book.
Marisha: You should.
Liam: You've got to swear.
Laura: Huh? Oh, I'm conjuring up a little fuck you.
Marisha: And what does Violet say? We're going to put the kick-ass back in team. Something like that?
Laura: It's pretty great.
Marisha: Rat Queens. It's great. Yeah!
Matt: Travis, what are you dressed as?
Travis: I'm Helga the angry tavern wench, and I only love one man: Scanlan.
Matt: (laughs) That's fantastic. Other side of the table, let's see.
Marisha: Oh, look who just showed up.
Matt: Who are you dressed as, Sam?
Sam: I'm either a porn actor or Burt Reynolds. I can't smile. (laughter)
Sam: It's Smokey and the Bandit. I can't get him to stay.
Matt: That's okay, we'll find some duct tape for you.
Sam: My costume is awesome.
Matt: Awesome, it is awesome. Yeah, your monkey's been a little rough.
Laura: Oh my god, I'm so sweaty.
Zac: Our mustaches need to take a picture with each other.
Travis: Oh that is some 'stache love.
Matt: Oh, that's amazing.
Travis: Dirty, dirty 'stache love.
Matt: All right, Taliesin.
Taliesin: I am Quentin Quire, Kid Omega of the X-Men, for those of you who read way too much X-Men, so this is my throw-together, because he has a mohawk and so few people do.
Laura: But we skipped over my brother.
Matt: Yes, indeed, because he vanished.
Liam: I'm the Dread Pirate Roberts, and I will most likely kill you in the morning-- or myself, because this is actually very sharp
Travis: Do you have a comment about my perfect breasts and the shortage of them? Oh no! Careful, they are expensive.
Matt: Put that right there. Be careful, or there's actually stabbing in real life as opposed to just the game today. That'll be fun.
Liam: Liam doesn't know how to use knives or swords at all.
Matt: He'll learn in time.
Matt: I'm dressed as Geralt of Rivia from the Witcher Series. Witcher 3, specifically, for this set of armor and outfit.
Liam: How about that costume, ladies and gentlemen?
Marisha: He made all of that, by the way.
Liam: He's a full-size action figure.
Sam: He made that?
All: Yeah.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Matt: I have a problem. Well, the problem is being a huge fan of the Witcher series for a long time. But yeah, that's our crazy Halloween-ness. We'll kick back here in just a minute to start the game and see what the wonders and dangers of Whitestone bring to Vox Machina. See you in just a second.
Laura: We're all going to die when we're goofy looking. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. So to get you guys up to speed with the current situation, in our currently non-air conditioned studio-- great day for this to coincide. Vox Machina had an encounter with two individuals known as the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, who currently control Whitestone, the city that Percival-- Taliesin's character-- once lived in, his family once essentially ruled, before they were usurped and most of them murdered by the Briarwoods. So upon meeting them, a vengeance urge kicked up within Percival. The rest of the party following him to Whitestone to attempt to free the city from the clutches of the very seemingly evil and in some cases undead Briarwoods, as the Lord Briarwood appears to be vampiric in nature. After arriving, they had some stealth missions, they went around and discovered a fair warning on the Sun Tree, one of the central items of Whitestone, a relic of Pelor from long ago that the city was built around, now dead and holding a series of bodies hung from it, all dressed and painted to look like the members of Vox Machina. While they were there, they managed to find and hole up in an abandoned tavern. Closing the windows off, and after doing a little bit of digging, spoke to the head of the Lady's Chamber, the temple to Erathis to which Percival and most of the team seems to be interested in starting a rebellion in Whitestone. They planted the seed there to return to germinate at some point. And then began to follow a couple of individuals, or at least an individual that was partially responsible for the really honestly shitty social atmosphere in Whitestone. Following him back to a home, it was discovered that Sir Kerrion, one of the individuals responsible for the death of Percival's family, was still part of the ruling class here. The party then snuck in through the bottom of the building, stealthed into a full surprise ambush upon him and his compatriots. Murdered most of them. They took his toady, essentially, Vouk, and instead of murdering him, tore out his tongue and then burned the de Rolo family crest into his forehead--
Liam: You say they. Not quite how I remember it.
Taliesin: The way you're putting that is a lot worse than actually--
Matt: I know, but it's fun to push it that way.
Taliesin: I feel this is a little one-sided.
Matt: But yeah, with his tongue removed and the symbol burned into his forehead, he was thrown out the window, and the party then escaped into the night rain, returning to their tavern, and that was where we left off. So. As you guys come in from the soaking-wet rain that seemed to have been now pouring continuously through the city of Whitestone, you come to the quiet of your tavern, the sun beginning to find its way, setting across the evening sky. What would you like to do?
Liam: I'm having a real hard time roleplaying right now.
Matt: I don't know what you mean. What are you doing Vax? Come on.
Laura: It's actually really difficult to play a character when you're dressed as a different character, not going to lie.
Matt: Well, we're going to learn!
Laura: We're going to learn how to do it.
Marisha: You wanna roleplay as the character you're dressed as. Yeah, it's hard. Don't do that.
Travis: I don't know, I feel as groggy as ever.
Matt: I don't think Scanlan's going to have a problem tonight.
Sam: Nope, this is how I imagine myself to be.
Liam: I am not going to look at that table at all tonight. All auditory for you three. Sorry.
Laura: So we are-- wait, I forget.
Matt: You guys just now returned to the tavern.
Laura: We're in the tavern. It's nighttime now?
Matt: It's starting to push later into the evening, now you guys have returned to the tavern.
Sam: And as we returned to the tavern, did we see hustle and bustle of people rising up in rebellion, by any chance?
Matt: Not yet.
Marisha: Overnight rebellion!
Matt: It's been fairly fresh since you even started the word of it.
Travis: We were very discreet and discreetly putting the Dust of Tracelessness on the ground.
Matt: Yes, you were, and you're finding your way through, there doesn't appear to be anyone following. Plus there was a large distraction with Sir Kerrion's homestead being lit on fire. The rain taking care of most of it, but it drew people out of their homes to see this giant blazing symbol of the de Rolo family burning across the rooftop. So a message was definitely left and probably received by somebody, and what are your plans?
Travis: One down, how many left? How many are there left?
Marisha: Four? Four.
Taliesin: Four.
Travis: There are five total? Whoa, I did math.
Marisha: There are six barrels. One is empty.
Sam: Do you think the other two are-- the barrel names: so two are Sylas and Delilah.
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: And we know that one of the other two barrel names resides in that place that we found. The countess, what was her name? The doctor?
Taliesin: Doctor Ripley.
Sam: And what's the fourth name?
Taliesin: Professor Anders.
Laura: Are we really going to talk about names right now and not about the giant creepy smoke monster that came out of you, Percy?
Liam: I think we need to find a place to lay low. Not here, not where we've been. Somewhere else. I think we need to scope out another place.
Laura: I don't think it's safe to leave tonight.
Sam: I agree with Vex that we can't leave tonight. The streets are going to be crawling with guards and people looking for us.
Marisha: Are we back in our hole where we were?
Matt: You're back in the tavern where you guys were.
Laura: It might be smart to be down in the cellar tonight, not up.
Taliesin: I agree.
Sam: Is there any sort of way you can close us in and make it look like it's a single-story dwelling?
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah, we'll go down to the tree and we'll make it look like no one's ever tunneled down there before.
Marisha: Yeah, I mean we can literally camp next to the roots of the tree if we want to. I made it look nice in there.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: I can clear out a bit more space.
Laura: Burt, your mustache is falling off.
Sam: It is?
Liam: (giggles) You know the situation is very dire, I don't know why I'm laughing, it's a nervous habit. I'm sorry.
Marisha: Speaking of nervous habits.
Sam: One of us has a nervous habit of ejecting smoke from his rib cage.
Marisha: I was also thinking about the weird cough that you have. I don't think you're getting sick. What's going on? Oh, and we've tunneled, right? We're below the ground.
Matt: You guys have made your way to the inn, if you all wanted to go down and to the tree--
Marisha: Let's go down into the cellar. I'm going to go ahead and throw up some walls.
Travis: Walls, or the false ground?
Marisha: I can do the false terrain--
Laura: Yeah, do that.
Marisha: I'll do Hallucinatory Terrain, and I will make it look like she said. One story, no cellar.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: So the opening to the cellar will be just a dirt floor.
Marisha: Just wooden floor, yeah.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: No one's here, looks like it hasn't been touched.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Those eyes make you look far more sarcastic than you normally do.
Matt: Do they?
Taliesin: (shouting) Argh, god! (laughter)
Laura: And he doesn't even smile at all.
Travis: Jeez, you're the worst.
Liam: So Percival, spill your guts. What the fuck is going on?
Taliesin: I don't entirely know. Where to begin?
Liam: You didn't look surprised when that happened.
Marisha: No, in fact, you pulled down your mask, which you don't normally do in battles.
Taliesin: It felt-- it didn't feel like a surprise. I don't know. It didn't feel good. I was hoping it would.
Laura: You didn't seem to mind it as it was happening.
Taliesin: I think I wanted him to recognize me.
Marisha: Who?
Taliesin: Kerrion. I don't know. I was hoping it would feel better.
Marisha: Could you feel it happening while it was? Were you conscious? Do you remember what you did?
Liam: What the fuck is it? What is it, Percival? What is it?
Taliesin: A few years ago, I had a dream. I had a very intense dream, and in this dream, something asked me if I wanted revenge. If I wanted the means to have revenge. And all I would have to do in return is offer up the souls of those I took.
Laura: (flatly) Oh, that's all.
Sam: Wait, what?
Taliesin: It was a dream! It was just a dream.
Sam: And yet you've fashioned your entire life's goal upon this dream.
Taliesin: I woke up in the morning with an idea, and I built that idea. I thought it was prophetic, and lately I've been feeling a bit of strain, and recalling it, but it was just a dream!
Sam: So the day after this dream was when you first developed your Pepperbox?
Taliesin: It's not the first time I felt inspired in my life. I just-- it wasn't real.
Marisha: And Percy, how long after the coup and after you lost your family was this dream?
Taliesin: (sighs) Maybe a year. I was fuzzy at first; I wasn't really me anymore. I was a fisherman for a while. I didn't do anything. This was something to do with myself; this was something to work towards.
Liam: Well, we're clearly not talking about a dream anymore. We all saw it. Do you have any theories?
Taliesin: I don't. I don't know. I've never thought about it. It didn't matter.
Liam: It matters now.
Taliesin: I don't know what to do.
Laura: Who is the last bullet for?
Taliesin: (sighs)
Laura: We don't want to lose you, Percy.
Taliesin: When I started this, I talked to a man, at one point. He was the captain of one of the vessels I was on. I told him what I intended to do, and I showed him what I was building. And he said that if I really wanted revenge, if revenge was what I was after, that there would be no stopping it. And there would be casualties along the way, and I would have to give up things, and I would have to hurt people. And that was the price, so that last barrel is because it's not just five names; I know I'm going to have to keep hurting people and that this thing existing is just going to keep hurting people. It's the knowledge that it never ends. It's because I haven't just killed five people. I've killed a lot of people on my way here. I've killed them with you. And it's to remind me that this is what I've chosen.
Liam: I don't understand. We've killed with reason.
Taliesin: And I have tried to. And I certainly have reason for these five names. They are not good people. These are not people who should be allowed to live.
Liam: None of us debate that the Briarwoods and their circle should be allowed to go on. We all understand what they're capable of. We all understand that they need to be removed. But what we just saw goes beyond, and you're telling us that this is going to continue after the Briarwoods and their like are gone. What are we to look forward to, Percival? Where are we going?
Taliesin: I was hoping that once I'd finished serving revenge that perhaps I could serve repentance.
Marisha: You're speaking of these as if they're metaphysical beings. You're serving revenge. That sounds very literal, and from what I've seen, isn't inaccurate.
Taliesin: I no longer feel in control. I no longer trust myself. I wouldn't expect you to trust me.
Liam: Stretching a little thin right now, Percy.
Taliesin: But I trust you.
Sam: Can I just do a quick insight to see if he's being entirely honest?
Matt: You may.
Sam: Well, that didn't work. Much better. 18.
Matt: 18. Go ahead and roll a dice, Percival.
Taliesin: Dice plus what?
Matt: Actually, I'll roll it for you. What's your bonus?
Taliesin: For which?
Matt: For both persuasion and deception.
Taliesin: Persuasion and deception? Persuasion, six. Deception, two.
Matt: Okay. He seems very earnest, very broken. Confused, but driven, and there isn't any part of his voice that seems to conceal or attempt to hold back any information.
Travis: Are you afraid you're going to hurt us?
Taliesin: No. I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you.
Marisha: How would you disappoint us?
Taliesin: I trust that you are all here in the service of justice and maybe friendship. But I'm not. I'm here for revenge. And as much as I would like to believe otherwise, I know that's not true. And I think I need people here who are not here for revenge. I don't know how to stop this.
Marisha: Just because you started on this path for revenge doesn't mean you can't find other motivations along the way. Do you believe you're not doing this with your friends or for your friends? Not even a little bit; it's only a hundred percent revenge?
Taliesin: No one does anything purely for one reason. And I could justify it, but I'd be lying. I want to hurt them. I want them to know it's me. I want them to feel remorse for what they have done. I want them to pay, and if this thing is real, if this is really what is happening now, I hope that wherever they go, they suffer forever and beyond.
Travis: I think that sounds fair.
Taliesin: And I'm so grateful there is justice to be found in it, but it is not justice that I am motivated by. And I couldn't pretend it would be. I am so grateful there is justice in this. But even if there wasn't, I would still be here.
Liam: I want to talk about a plan, because our desires are in lockstep up to a point. Once we have gotten rid of the last of them, I want to know what happens then, Percival.
Taliesin: I've never had to think of this before. I think if we get out of this, either I'm going to need you to save me or finish me.
Laura: No, we won't do that.
Taliesin: If it comes to it.
Laura: Damn it, where is Pike?! She would know about this.
Travis: She would.
Marisha: I miss Pike.
Taliesin: Well, I do want to save this city.
Laura: Can we do any kind of religion check to see if we know anything about this kind of entity?
Matt: Yeah, go ahead and make a religion check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: Suiting.
Marisha: (laughs) Suiting.
Laura: 17.
Matt: I mean, there are all sorts of extraplanar entities throughout the realms that have their own individual descriptions.
Marisha: Whenever he starts a description with "I mean," it's not good.
Matt: You don't have a whole lot of experience outside of the realm of mortals. You've had a few interactions with things that skew beyond that realm. While you get that he's saying it may just be a dream, you know that there are multitudes of creatures that thrive on these types of bargains. You do know that many of these bargains in the long run do not end up being wholly in the person's favor who struck it.
Travis: Well, look. It's going to help him on his quest, get revenge and kill all the people that killed his family, right? So can we do that, and then if it gets out of control, we bop him on the head and take him to a temple?
Laura: I think that's the best plan we have, actually.
Travis: I mean, you were really awesome in that last fight.
Laura: You did look pretty amazing, I'm not going to lie.
Travis: A little bit of pee came out. It was that good.
Laura: But I don't like how dark it went, Percy. It went really dark.
Liam: And here's the thing. There's a thing. There it is, right there. Here's the thing.
Taliesin: Oh god, I hadn't even noticed. So sorry.
Liam: Your chances of succeeding here alone are pretty fucking slim. And if you want us all to work with you, you can't go from door to door, bringing wrath and ruin the way you just did, or you won't have our assistance. Not all of us.
Sam: Now now, Vax, what are you talking about? We all knew what we were doing when we-- pay attention to me! I'm trying to be serious here. Don't you turn your eyes away from me. Look at me when I'm talking to you. We all knew what we were doing when we went into the house. It was an assassination mission. I don't understand why everyone's harping on how dark it got. We knew we were there to kill everyone in the whole place.
Liam: This is a city oppressed. These people did not invite it upon themselves.
Laura: That guy deserved it, but we did rip his tongue out, which I think was a bit harsh.
Travis: He said take his tongue.
Liam: These people don't want to exchange one warlord for another. We need to maybe dial it back a tick or two.
Sam: No, I disagree.
Travis: I do, too, Pedostache.
Sam: We have to make a strong appearance. This is shock and awe. We're not going to win over the people by half measures and hey, let's hold an election, or something. We have to kill everyone in as dramatic a fashion as possible.
Laura: This is beheading a pony all over again.
Liam: You think we're going to win them over by showing them how disgusting we are?
Sam: No, how disgusting they are, and how disgusting they die.
Liam: No. I mean the civilians here.
Laura: We're not going to kill civilians!
Liam: Of course, but we're trying to win them over, and if we're showing that we're ripping out their tongues and pulling their ears off and flaying their balls, they're going to be just as scared of us as they are of the Briarwoods.
Laura: They'll probably be pretty happy that the people that have been hurting them are being punished.
Marisha: Yes, they've been oppressed, but we've also seen there's plenty of cases of people being charmed by them. We might have an army of people who will die for the Briarwoods at any cost and not even realizing they're being charmed that way.
Sam: I wouldn't mind a few people being scared of us, too.
Taliesin: I will say it did get out of hand. And if I had known then what I know now, I would hope that you would restrain me in those moments where I seem to be going further than I should.
Laura: Done.
Travis: Are you saying for your final bullet, you want us to stop you?
Laura: No, he's saying that if he goes dark, if he goes against his person that we know--
Taliesin: Knock me out and take me to a temple.
Travis: You don't want to scratch the name off the barrel?
Taliesin: I didn't know it was going to disappear, to be fair. I thought that maybe I could stop what was happening to me. I panicked.
Marisha: Percy, do you realize we tried to talk to you for a good 15 minutes after all that last night, and you were unreachable? Do you remember that? So us saying if you start getting out of control, and you think that we're going to be able to be like, yo Percy, calm it down a bit--
Laura: We're not going to do that. We're going to knock him the fuck out!
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Don't worry, Percy. We've got you.
Sam: I don't think I would knock him out.
Travis: I'll knock you out if you really want me to.
Taliesin: If I start to turn against you. If you think for a moment that I am out of control. Please, please, do what is necessary. The moment that I turn on any of you, the moment that I even threaten any of you is a moment I am not in control. No matter what is happening.
Travis: Yeah. Okay.
Laura: I walk up and I kiss him on the cheek. and I say: Don't you worry, we've got you.
Taliesin: Especially with the cough, thank you.
Laura: I don't believe you're really sick, darling.
Sam: Vex, I've heard a cough like that, and it's probably syphilis.
Laura: Lovely. Thank you, Scanlan.
Taliesin: I barely sl-- I don't, I--
Sam: Personal experience, that's all I'm saying.
Travis: Shall we rest and then we go find another house?
Marisha: Well, maybe we should, now that we have the knock-Percy-out-in-case-of-emergency plan, should we have a revolution plan? Because we seem to be divided on that.
Taliesin: There's still two more lords in the city. And there is the castle. They know we're here now.
Sam: It might behoove us to spend a day or two finding another shelter, and also seeing what our actions have resulted in, and seeing if we can't sway some opinion in our favor, because we're strong, but we're also pretty weak these days, and I wouldn't want to go against the big guns yet until we have the people behind us. Or at least possibly turn one of those giants to our side or something. We need some help.
Laura: We have a map of the city, yes? I think it best to stay off the streets. Is it possible, Keyleth, to tunnel through the city, underneath it?
Taliesin: Good idea.
Marisha: I can, actually. Yeah.
Sam: Can't really talk to people that way.
Laura: No, but they know we're here. It's not safe. We can come up in secret, leave symbols to rally the people, and hide again.
Marisha: You want to get a beat on the vibe of what people are saying out there?
Sam: Hey, hep cat, yes. I'm wanting to get a beat on the vibe. Yes, I think we need to hear what people are saying. In the privacy of their homes, maybe. Do some snooping.
Marisha: Well, there's a few people in our party who are good at that.
Sam: And we need to find another potential safehouse.
Marisha: Okay, that's plan number one, then. I think it's not a bad idea that we spread this de Rolo family crest around.
Taliesin: Have we been to the Alcove yet?
Matt: You went to the Alcove-- no, you have not been to the Alcove.
Taliesin: We haven't been to the Alcove or the barracks yet. The barracks are right against the castle, though.
Matt: Correct. You went to the Lady's Chamber and you spoke briefly with Keeper Yennen.
Taliesin: Yeah, with Keeper Yennen.
Travis: Yeah, let's go to the barracks.
Matt: And you went to Beyond the Horizon, which was abandoned and partially collapsed.
Taliesin: The barracks will be our last stop, I believe. Just because it's outside the city proper and it's up the hill. We might be able to stay at the Alcove, which is a magic shop that used to be in town. I know the proprietor, or I did, if he's still alive.
Travis: Yeah, let's go there.
Marisha: Magic shop? Okay.
Taliesin: It was a magic shop, right?
Matt: Yeah, it's an arcane boutique, yes.
Taliesin: An arcane boutique.
Marisha: Are we tunneling there?
Laura: Are we going there now? Are we resting?
Sam: We should rest.
Marisha: It's nighttime!
Matt: Right now, I would say, based on preparation, the illusion-casting, conversation, you're looking at about 9:00, 9:30 in the evening.
Taliesin: We could get an early start once the light hits.
Sam: If you fall asleep, is that illusion going to vanish?
Marisha: No, I think Hallucinatory Terrain lasts for--
Laura: Can I sense anything near us? Can I sense vampires above us?
Matt: So you're looking for undead?
Laura: Undead.
Matt: Okay. You feel a surrounding presence scattered throughout the city, some large, some small. You can gather over a period of time of concentration, you can feel the slow movement of the zombie giants moving through the city, the sentinels slowly tromping through, and a number of other undead entities there.
Laura: Does it feel like there's more in motion than there were before we set off the blaze?
Matt: I would say yes, there appears to be a little more haste and movement to what entities you can-- and you can't pinpoint specifics, but you do sense that there is a heightened state of movement, to what you've previously sensed.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Yes I've a thought that at night, obviously, these streets are full of dead things. Tomorrow, the Briarwoods and the people that work for them are going to start pulling people out of their houses and telling them to look for us or anyone who's not from this city, so I don't think that the beggar routine is going to work for much longer.
Laura: That's why we stay under the city. That's what I said.
Liam: Of course, but if you want to talk to people, I think we could probably get away with poking about first thing in the morning and that's it.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: So we should probably get up early.
Laura: All right.
Sam: And in addition to your excellent illusion spell--
Marisha: Which lasts for 24 hours.
Sam: That's wonderful to hear. Is there any other means of protection we have? I mean, if they are magic wielders, they might be able to sense our presence or something. Is there any way to obscure that? I guess I'm asking this, but I'm one of the only two magic wielders here, so I should know the answer.
Marisha: I was going to say, it would be probably a me and you thing. In terms of making us not as noticeable, Seeming is probably going to be our closest thing. I don't have anything--
Sam: It's just a visual, though.
Laura: Nothing like a bubble of protection or anything?
Marisha: I've got my Antilife Shell.
Laura: But they're undead. Lovely. Well, first watch. Who's taking it?
Marisha: We can all get a good night's sleep, I think, if I tunnel us in and we've got Hallucinatory Terrain.
Laura: I still think we should keep watch.
Travis: Percy's got it, yeah. I'll take second.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: So you're all down at the bottom of the tunnel by the roots of the Sun Tree? And you have Hallucinatory Terrained the cellar?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: I hate that he's asking for clarification.
Matt: What?
Laura: Don't 'what?' me.
Matt: What's the DC of your spell?
Marisha: Of Hallucinatory Terrain?
Matt: Of all your spellcasting, what's the DC?
Marisha: It's 17. No, 18. But I know they have to make an intelligence save to see through Hallucinatory Terrain.
Matt: Correct. If something were interested in doing so.
Marisha: Exactly, hypothetically.
Matt: So who's taking first watch?
Travis: Percy.
Sam: I will watch with him.
Marisha: Yeah, Percy can't watch alone.
Taliesin: No, that's fine.
Sam: I'll watch with him.
Liam: I mean, I raised my hand before, but that's all right. I'll get some sleep.
Matt: Okay. It's tight quarters. And you know, other than either a magical light or torch someone wants to put up, there is no light source. It is pitch black down here. What are you guys using as a light source, or are you leaving it pitch dark?
Laura: Well, you can light your little flaming warhammer.
Travis: Fine. I take the Flaming Warhammer, and I whisper the magic word, bacon. And it turns on fire.
Laura: I'm pretty sure he just said bagel.
Marisha: Bagel?
Matt: All righty. So, you guys take first watch, rest is till about 11PM or midnight or so. You guys finish. Who's taking second watch? All right, we've got Grog and Vax. All right so, you guys--
Liam: While Percival is sleeping, I pull Grog over and we look at him for a while, and I say, where do you think the smoke comes out of?
Travis: Oh, that's a good question.
Liam: Do you think it's the nostrils?
Travis: No, it looked like it was coming from the bottom up, and there's only two holes down there, so it's either--
Liam: Yeah, that's right.
Travis: Either the dirt button--
Liam: It could just be his pores. You're right, it's probably--
Travis: It's probably the periscope. You're right.
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, the air down here, it's damp earth. It's chilled in the night, anyway, but it's a little warmer because you're under the ground, and it's absorbed some of the heat of the day. But it is getting noticeably colder.
Marisha: It's getting colder?
Matt: Yeah, just as the evening progresses. The temperature at night here--
Sam: Colder than it did last night? Because it also got pretty cold last night.
Matt: Comparable, yeah. There's a low mist begins to form within the tunnel from the temperature.
Liam: I wake up my sister.
Laura: What, what do you want?
Liam: There's fog or something. What's going on?
Travis: It's just cold.
Laura: Can we see if it's magic?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Liam: Do that thing again. You can tell when stuff's around.
Laura: Oh good, I rolled a one.
Travis: Can I do a nature check to show them it's just fucking fog?
Matt: Yeah, go ahead and roll.
Travis: A 13.
Matt: Okay. You step forward and take a good long look at the fog that is slowly beginning to form at the base of the tunnel you guys are in. As you lean forward and take it in, the fog begins to form into a physical humanoid essence and reach out for you. For the three that are conscious, roll initiative.
Sam: Oh god!
Laura: Shit. It's a teeny tiny tunnel.
Marisha: It's another damn ghost wraith thing ghosting in.
Matt: All right.
Sam: So what if the Sun Tree is like--
Laura: The source of the bad?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: It's possible it is.
Marisha: That's kind of funny. (laughter)
Laura: What if the Briarwoods are right under the Sun Tree, and we're right above them?
Travis: What if they didn't hang the bodies, the tree just grabbed people?
Matt: So Grog back in the fog, Vex is waking up the back, Trinket asleep next to her. Percy, Scanlan.
Taliesin: Actually, can you move the Wyrmwood box, because all I'm--
Liam: Yes, Wyrmwood Gaming, check them out. Beautiful boxes.
Matt: Indeed, all right. This will go there for now.
Laura: You look really good, Matt.
Matt: I can't move in this. Great. All right, so. Get some initiatives on this. For Grog?
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17, all righty. Okay, Laura?
Laura: Oh, 22.
Matt: 22, all right, and?
Liam: 18.
Matt: 18. Good to know.
Sam: Are we spooning?
Taliesin: We're sporking.
Sam: Oh, we are?
Marisha: You guys might be sporking.
Matt: So Vex, Grog, then you rolled a what?
Liam: 18.
Matt: Oh, sorry, Vax. Vex, you rolled a--
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22, right, Grog you were a--
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17, okay. So Grog, this is technically a surprise round on you, then we'll get back to you guys on top of the initiative. You can see now, the mist has formed into a pale humanoid, with two more now that have rolled in. These pale-looking, intensely feral human beings with elongated fangs emerge from this mist and immediately lunge out towards you.
Laura: Are they vampires?
Marisha: Can they do that?
Laura: They can. They're fucking vampires.
Sam: No, they can only become bats. I read about this.
Liam: (sings) Let's do this.
Matt: So, first and foremost, the one that lunges out at Grog is going to shift to the side there. Is going to make a claw attack against you. That is a 20 to hit?
Travis: That hits.
Matt: That hits. All right, you take eight points of slashing damage-- or no, you do not, actually. Instead, it is going to attempt to grapple you. Not attempt, it grapples you. So it reaches out and grasps on to some of the hide armor you have tied around your shoulder, pulls you in, and is going to attempt to sink its teeth into your actual body.
Laura: Don't forget that we all have our amazing metal around our neck that Scanlan got us.
Matt: That's true. (laughter)
Liam: You're so intimidating in that costume.
Matt: Good. That is a 17 versus armor class.
Travis: That misses.
Matt: Okay, so it attempts to bite into you, you move out of the way just in time, and that little bit of chain mail, that practically useless piece of chainmail wrapped around your giant thick neck does manage to catch its fangs and deflect the attack initially.
Liam: Hey!
Laura: Hey!
Sam: What, that piece of metal thing? Hey, I made that. I call it a Scanlan. I call everything a Scanlan.
Matt: This one is going to swoop in as you are now currently grappled by the other one. It's going to attempt to grab you on the other side. That is a 21 to hit, so it's going to grapple you. And this one is also going to now reach up with its claws to pull down the chain mail, grasps you there. Since it's a surprise round, natural 20. All right, so you take five points of piercing damage, and--
Sam: And you're a vampire.
Matt: And 11 points of necrotic, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 11.
Travis: Okay, really?
Laura: Oh no, we haven't had another feast yet.
Sam: Oh, and the feast is gone too, isn't it?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So this third one over here is going to attempt to come after you, Vax, closest to it. That is a 24 to hit.
Liam: Well, that hits, but I'm going to use Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Okay, to reduce the damage?
Liam: Yeah, by half.
Matt: That's 2d4 slashing against you. Ten points of slashing damage.
Liam: Is the half?
Matt: Yes, it's going to try to claw you again. That's a 12.
Liam: Nope.
Matt: Yeah, so the first one slashes across the side of your shoulder, but you manage to pull out of the way just in time to lessen the impact. This, however, sets you up for the easily dodged second blow. You swoop out of the way just barely in time, feeling the wind (whoosh) above your head. That ends their turn. Now we're at the top of the initiative order: surprise round. This would not have been enough noise to wake you guys yet, so you're going to hold on until somebody can get your attention. Top of the round will be Vex.
Laura: I'm going to say  Wake the fuck up! And I am going to-- can I hide? Is that what I do as my bonus?
Matt: You have nowhere to hide in this room, unfortunately.
Laura: Even if it's super-duper dark?
Matt: You get the idea that these creatures probably aren't largely affected by the dark.
Laura: That makes perfect sense. I'm going to Hunter's Mark the one that looks the strongest.
Matt: Okay. The one that's most visible to you would probably be this one going after your brother. You mark that one.
Laura: I am now going to attack him with my blazing bow.
Matt: All righty, go for it.
Laura: All right. Natural 20!
Travis: Nice! Wyrmwood Box.
Taliesin: Breaking in the new box.
Laura: That's right.
Liam: (sings) It's my dice in a box.
Marisha: Dice in a box, yeah.
Taliesin: Dice in a box, yeah.
Laura: I add all of my dice together and then I double it, and then I add the modifier? Okay. And I Hunter's Marked him, yeah.
Matt: Yes, you did.
Laura: 31.
Matt: 31 definitely hits.
Laura: That's 31 damage.
Matt: Oh, 31 damage. (laughs) Okay. All righty.
Laura: The second one was a three. It was a 14 to hit.
Matt: No, unfortunately it dodges out of the way. Its reflexes are very quick.
Liam: Be honest, the karma will come back to you.
Matt: Right, so as you pull back, you release, and with a flash of burning energy, your arrow ignites mid-transit. It blasts and bursts into the vampiric creature, who hisses at you (snarls) through the dark. The second arrow, however, it's completely ready for and actually manages to swipe it out of the air with its clawed hand. Okay, that ends your turn. Next up is Vax.
Liam: All right, there is one vampire right in front of me, right? The one who hurt me.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: But I'm looking past his head at the one next to Grog, the one that's got a blade down there on the map. No, the other one. Yeah, I think I've got a pretty good shot at him. I'm going to ignore the vampire in front of me and since Grog is right up against that guy, I'm going to sneak attack him and go (daggers flying) Oh no, first I'm going to go click with my heels, and then I'm going to (daggers flying).
Marisha: Click, click. Dagger, dagger, dagger.
Matt: Dagger, dagger, dagger! What you got?
Liam: It's all right. It's a 19. The second is a 28. And the third is a 21.
Matt: Yep.
Liam: All three hit?
Matt: Yeah, the first one was?
Liam: I don't remember.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18. Yeah. They all hit; not a problem.
Liam: Okay, so the first one is the sneak attack, and that one gets-- oh, I should be using the Wyrmwood box. Eight plus 12, 15, 18, 25. 25 for the first one. And for the second dagger that sinks into his head, that is eight. And for the third one that sinks into his fanged fucking face, that is nine.
Matt: All righty. Cool, so you click your Boots of Haste. You feel the influx of adrenaline hit your body, the magical push. You take the daggers and (daggers flying) the vampire in front of you tries to swipe out of your hands, but you're too fast; you've already released all three before he even gets to your wrist and pull back, grinning at it. All three daggers (dagger impacts) repeatedly, hitting nearly the same point like an amazing throwing of darts. Just smack, smack, smack into the center of the chest of the vampire across the way. It's distracted by Grog; it doesn't see them coming until it is too late, and it screeches out in pain (screeching) towards you. The eyes help on this, huh? A nice and sizable chunk of damage. All righty, that ends your turn, unless you want to try to move?
Liam: Yeah, actually I'm going to-- no. nope. I'm good.
Matt: All right. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to rage. (laughter)
Matt: Please do.
Travis: And I would like to take my Firebrand Warhammer and pound that shit to the left of me twice in the head with my fiery hammer.
Matt: All righty, go for it.
Travis: Oh, yeah. That is a 15.
Matt: 15 just barely hits.
Travis: And that's a one.
Liam: It's so hard to roleplay tonight.
Travis: It's so difficult.
Marisha: I'm Jimmy Falloning so hard over here.
Matt: Yeah, you are. (chuckles)
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16 on the first one. All right. That guy on the left, the one that just got three daggers to its chest. As the dagger vanishes from its wound, it looks over at you, at your already big grin, mid-swing (wham). The warhammer blasts into its chest, a burst of fire wreathing around its torso for a second. It gets pushed up against the wall. This time, you go to swing with all your might on your second blow, trying to smash it up against the earth that you guys have carved this tunnel out of. It ducks out of the way in split-second timing, and your hammer gets wedged into the side of the wall. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: Pull that shit out.
Travis: Shit. Nine.
Matt: Nine. It's pretty well wedged in there right now.
Liam: Next weapon.
Matt: All right, so. Now this one's going to shift over this way towards you, Percy. As you're on the ground prone still, just coming to consciousness. He just (snarls) and lunges out towards you. This one's going to move here, placing in that position, this one's going to stay there. All right, so the one rolling against you, Grog. It still has you-- no, the one that had you grappled walked away towards Percy. The other one's going to attempt to grapple you. That was 18?
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Misses. You slap aside with your hand as you still try to pull the warhammer out of the wall, and then it gets clotheslined by the grip you have on it. It's going to try to strike you with its claws for the second attack. That's a ten. Yeah, no.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: You (swish) out of its way, laughing in its face. The one against you, Percy, where you're on the ground prone. Oh okay, that'll be an 18?
Taliesin: I'm an 18.
Matt: It grabs you by the front of your shit and lifts you up with that hissing sound. Yeah, that'll be a 25. It pulls you in and sinks its fangs into the side of your throat. You can feel yourself gasp out in pain as the cold sensation pulses through your body, the actual life's blood being drained from you. Okay, you take four points of piercing damage, and you take eight points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by eight.
Travis: I forgot I have advantage on strength checks when I'm raging.
Matt: Roll again.
Travis: A one.
Laura: Wow, really?
Taliesin: It's as if the gods defy you.
Matt: So you're now grappled and held there. It's pulling the blood out of your throat, you're caught off guard and completely just confused, frightened, and in serious pain at this moment. All right, and the one that's Hunter's Marked, that's against you. It's going to attempt to grab you. That's a 20?
Liam: Yeah, that works.
Matt: Okay, no damage. It's just going to grab you. And it goes in to attempt to go through your throat. You being prepared for this, having been subjected to this once before, you bring a dagger up towards its face and it just barely manages to pull out of the way before you thrust it up through the bottom of its neck. You manage to deflect the attack. All right, the people who just woke up, roll initiative, please.
Sam: Initiative?
Matt: Which, for the record Scanlan, as a fan mentioned to me this last week, your jack-of-all-trades ability as a bard that gives you plus two to all things you're not proficient in also adds to your initiative, technically. So you have a plus two to your initiative. I've had this brought up multiple times, if it's not true.
Sam: I know it's been brought up to me. I thought it was a hypothetical. Is it true?
Matt: It's been clarified by a couple of publications that have been sent to me when I questioned it.
Liam: What is the bonus for that hat?
Matt: We'll consider that hat the plus two bonus.
Sam: (chuckles) So I get a plus two. I rolled a 20 initiative, then.
Matt: Oh snap. Scanlan next to Vax. Nice.
Marisha: 12.
Matt: 12. All right, Percy?
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: Wow.
Taliesin: I have really good initiative.
Matt: All right, so we are now at the top of the round. This puts us to Vex and Percy going simultaneously.
Taliesin: I'll go first. I'm going to try and break grapple, obviously, since that's what I have to do.
Laura: Can I aid him by shooting him at the same time as he is trying to break the grapple?
Matt: You know what? Yes, go ahead and roll your first attack.
Liam: Go for the ear. It's a one.
Travis: You have the sage, still?
Taliesin: It's still at home.
Laura: It's been a lot of ones today, man.
Marisha: It's only our first hour.
Matt: Yeah, all right. So unfortunately, the first arrow-- there is too much movement to the bodies. It doesn't strike true, so you do not have advantage on this check. Acrobatics or athletics, your choice.
Taliesin: Acrobatics!
Matt: All righty.
Liam: Let's be clear, that was the shitty plastic die, not the Wyrmwood Box.
Taliesin: 28!
Matt: 28. You manage to break the grapple.
Taliesin: So that's my action, but if I now spend an action surge, I can get an action?
Matt: You can, yes.
Taliesin: Do I get three attacks with the sword I just picked up? Since I'm too close to use my gun right now?
Matt: Technically, yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going to draw the rapier that I just picked and start stabbing at the terrible thing, all the while screaming. (screams)
Matt: All right, go for it. (laughter)
Laura: Is your little butt flap down? Are you in the long johns?
Taliesin: The butt flap of my soul is down. I'm well-dressed at the moment.
Matt: It's a plus-one rapier. But your archery you took, I think was your combat?
Taliesin: Yes, so I get a negative two to attack.
Matt: Correct, to what you normally get. So you have a overall plus one.
Taliesin: So I get a plus one to attack, on top of my--
Matt: No, sorry. Minus one is the total from what you get for your pistols, for your Pepperbox.
Taliesin: Minus one, not minus two. Got it.
Matt: The magical rapier offsets that a bit.
Taliesin: That's 25.
Matt: 25 hits.
Taliesin: That's a one. Misses.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a third time.
Taliesin: And that's a 14.
Matt: Okay, so the first strike sinks true. That's 1d8 plus what's your strength modifier? Well, no it would be dex.
Taliesin: Dex, thank you! So that's 1d8 plus dex.
Matt: Plus one damage on top of that because it's a plus-one weapon.
Taliesin: That's a nine.
Matt: Nine damage. All right. So your first swing, the speed of your ability to break this grapple and then immediately pull this weapon and jam it forward. It pierces part of the body and pull out, the creature all of a sudden reaches over and grabs its side instinctually. You go for two more strikes; however, being the first time in a long time that you've ever held a rapier and still with your other hand holding your throat in severe pain, it flings forward twice. The second time, the creature actually grabs it and pulls you in towards it.
Taliesin: (yells)
Marisha: What?
Matt: So yeah. You're now considered re-grappled.
Taliesin: (yells)
Matt: So you can take another attack.
Laura: I'll do my second arrow and try to hit him again because I don't like that I missed.
Travis: Fucking hit him this time, will you?
Laura: I know, right? Don't suck so hard, me.
Liam: Come on, don't do that again. You're my sister.
Laura: That's better. That definitely hits. It was an 18 plus--
Matt: Oh, 18 plus stuff? Yeah. Go ahead and roll damage. This is against the one that's on Percy, still, or the one that's against your brother?
Laura: I said it was the one against Percy, even though the other one is Hunter's Marked.
Taliesin: Don't sound so upset about it.
Laura: Well, I'm just saying.
Matt: Too late.
Laura: Yes! 16.
Matt: 16, all right. This arrow, however, does manage to sink into its side. It protrudes about four inches from its body; it's pretty deep into its torso, breaking a couple of ribs, but you see the creature, being the undead nature of its physicality, it's not looking too great, but it's not at the end of its rope right now. All right, that ends that. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Okay, so there's three of these things?
Matt: There are three of them, yes.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to use my movement-- can I see them all?
Matt: You can currently, yes.
Sam: I'll use my movement, because I just woke up, to pee. Because I just woke up, I've got to pee.
Travis: Do you have morning--
Sam: It's midnight wood.
Travis: Okay, so it's probably going to go everywhere.
Liam: You're acting like you're botoxed.
Sam: I can't move my lips.
Matt: So Scanlan, you use your movement to pee.
Sam: While I'm peeing, I whip out my Wand of Magic Missiles and I point it, and I use four of the slots for it to shoot... four times three is 12 missiles.
Matt: Can you do that?
Sam: Each slot is one Magic Missile spell, which is three missiles.
Matt: I don't know if you can use multiple slots on a turn, can you?
Sam: It says so on the wand. "For one charge, you cast the 1st-level spell. You can increase the spell slot level for each additional charge you spend." So I'm going to use four of them.
Travis: Like a battleship.
Marisha: Like a level-4 magic missile.
Sam: Which is 4d4 plus four for each one that I hit.
Taliesin: Like a Rhinestone cowboy.
Liam: It's the mustache.
Travis: (sing) Rhinestone cowboy.
Taliesin: (sing) Rhinestone cowboy.
Marisha: (sing) Rhinestone cowboy.
Laura: Burt Reynolds should play with us more often.
Travis: He has the best old man laugh right now.
Sam: This guy is the brains of the operation.
Liam: Let me break the fourth wall just for a second to say that this game is totally fucked.
Matt: It creates an additional dart per spell level, so it's initially three, and it's three levels higher, it gets to six.
Sam: Oh, so it doesn't increase it three darts per level. It's one. So if I do a level four, I get two darts for each fucker.
Matt: Essentially, yeah. I'd be 6d4 plus six.
Sam: 6d4 plus six. Okay, so 2d4 plus two for each guy. I'll do that.
Matt: And they hit automatically. There is no roll for it.
Sam: Great. And it can't hit my friends or anything, right? I mean, they're Magic Missiles.
Matt: No, they unerringly hit. They're like homing arcane projectiles.
Sam: Do I have to roll this six times or just two?
Matt: Six times. I know.
Sam: So, three plus two for the first guy.
Matt: Okay, so five against him.
Sam: Ten for the second guy.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: And seven for the third guy.
Matt: All righty. So as you get up--
Sam: By the way, I'm holding my dick with one hand and the wand with the other. I'm dual wielding.
Marisha: Dual wielding! Are you proficient in that?
Matt: I think Scanlan is pretty proficient in this. I'm just saying. All right, so.
Sam: And they're both spraying everywhere.
Matt: Happy Halloween!
Travis: Are you writing your name with your left hand?
Matt: Okay, so. As you sign your signature on the ground, you also burst forth with a series of arcane bolts that streak across the room, slamming into the sides of each of these vampires. They all look towards you as a reaction to the pain, and their heads all turn curiously as to what they see. Not what they were expecting.
Sam: Don't worry, I won't wash my hands. (laughter)
Matt: All right, that's your movement and your action. I think that's your turn, right?
Sam: Do I get a bonus?
Matt: If you want to use one, yeah.
Sam: Sure, so I'll inspire Grog. (sings) I need Grog to rage and get us through this semi-fucked kind of fight, baby, baby. (laughter)
Travis: Wow, way back.
Sam: (sings) Kill-kill-kill kill-kill-kill-kill!
All: (sing) Kill-kill-kill kill-kill-kill-kill! (laughter)
Matt: All right. Take your d10 inspiration die, Grog. Oh man, I get a d10 inspiration for that.
Liam: Oh, that's so Ravenloft. (laughter)
Taliesin: Wow!
Matt: Good night, everybody! And we're done.
Sam: Take the inspiration back.
Matt: All right. Vax, you're up.
Liam: No, I'm not. I'm going to hold for a turn.
Laura: Are you really?
Matt: All right, Vax is now going after Grog. Right. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I want to hammer in the morning, and I want to pull my hammer out of the wall.
Matt: Okay, you can use one of your attacks to. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: Yay, that's better. That's a 28.
Matt: Yeah you (sucking noise) pull your hammer out without an issue. You're embarrassed at the fact that it was even embedded in what is essentially hard earth, and you still couldn't pull it free. But now it's blazing with flames; it's tight in your grasp. What are you going to follow it up with?
Travis: Can I use the great weapon master on these attacks, and I'll use reckless attack for advantage on them, and anybody that attacks me gets advantage, as well?
Matt: Okay. Yes, you can.
Travis: Thank god. 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Travis: Beautiful, and the second one. That's landed on the side. That's 24.
Matt: Yep, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage plus ten to each.
Travis: (sings) Yeah, nipples.
Matt: To which one, the one that's next to Percy or the one that's in front of you here?
Travis: The one that's next to me!
Matt: All righty.
Travis: 14 and 15, so 25 for the first one.
Matt: All right.
Travis: (sings) Stanky. (giggling)
Sam: Did you just say stanky?
Laura: Yeah, he did.
Liam: There is no difference between our old home game and this.
Sam: Except we don't have air conditioning.
Travis: 29.
Matt: 29 damage, jeez. So, the one that's harassing you. Chuckling at the fact that you've currently been unable to really prove your might as a goliath in front of these individuals, you grin as you pull it back and (wham) slam it directly in the face of it. It rears back, (growls) confused for a second. You can see a crack in its jaw and blood beginning to trickle down its jaw. You pull back and slam it a second time, this time with a resounding crack sound, as part of its jaw is dislodged and set to the side, its tongue dangling out, and dark black blood begins to pour from the center of its mouth as it looks to you with absolute fear. That was pretty rough.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: All righty, you want to do anything with your movement?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Actually, I'll put my back against the wall.
Matt: This one?
Travis: Yes. To open it up in case somebody wants to take a shot at him.
Matt: Okay. It will get an attack of opportunity on you. Are you cool with that?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right. With advantage because reckless attack. That is a 22.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: All right. You are raging, so you take ten points, so now five points of slashing damage.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: All righty. That brings us to Vax. Now it is your turn.
Liam: Right, yeah, I'm good now. So the vampire is still in front of me, right? I give him a look like, yeah, go fuck yourself, and then I keep throwing at the other guy who's with Grog still, right?
Matt: No, Grog moved away.
Liam: All right, then I'll handle the guy up front. I'm going to go for his guts. I'm going to go low. One, two, three right in his guts. First attack. Hit, way hits; that's a 30. And the second attack is a 24, and the third attack is a 17.
Matt: All right. So those all hit.
Liam: Okay, they do. That's 11 for the first and eight for the second and eight for the third. Right in his vampire guts.
Matt: (dagger impacts) You jam the dagger into its torso. It's trying to stop and slap the hands away, but you're too fast and the final hit, you push it up, and you're right in its face again; you can see its fangs still wet with the blood that it pulled from your throat, and you grin at it back as you withdraw the dagger with much force and anger.
Liam: And the last thing I say is, vampires ain't shit. (laughter)
Matt: Getting that on a jacket now. Vampires ain't shit. All right, cool. That ends your turn, unless you want to move or do anything else?
Liam: Nah.
Matt: All right. Now it's their turn. You notice, by the way: this round, specifically, as they're looking a little more wounded, their flesh begins to slowly reform. The wounds they've taken begin to seal up and the pouring of blood begins to slowly turn into a trickle.
Liam: So what? So does Scanlan's mustache.
Matt: It's true.
Sam: I would smile right now if I could. (laughter)
Taliesin: I want to tickle you. See what happens.
Matt: All righty. This one's going to move up to here.
Marisha: Did I just get seriously boned in initiative? Am I still sleeping?
Matt: Yeah, you're last. I mean, you'll be getting up this turn.
Marisha: I'm still asleep, guys.
Matt: Well, you're awake. You woke up, you're just prone.
Marisha: Well, I'm real groggy.
Matt: Real Grog-gy. Sorry, I'm so sorry.
Taliesin: It's never going to stop being funny.
Sam: You're so attractive tonight for some reason. Have we been together?
Travis: What? Oh, you and I have been together. Did you see?
Sam: Look at that.
Travis: I carved that in with a pen, myself, after our night together. Where have you been my whole life?
Matt: It's canon. (laughter)
Liam: This is our least serious episode ever. We cannot wear costumes but once a year.
Matt: Yeah. Only time that it works.
Sam: And Purim, also.
Taliesin: There will be a pajama night for Christmas.
All: Yeah.
Matt: Speaking of which. Percy, it's your turn. Oh, I'm sorry, it's their turn on you. There's two of them now, ganging up on you. Natural 20.
Marisha: How many's left? Three?
Liam: They're all still here. They're taking hits.
Matt: That's a 20 and a 15.
Taliesin: The 20 hits. The 15 does not.
Matt: All right. Well, you take 14 points of slashing damage from the claw. The second attack, it attempts to slash you a second time. You manage to dodge out of the way, putting your back up against the wall to barely avoid its grasp. However, the second one lunges towards you, attempting to grab you. That is a 19?
Taliesin: 19 hits.
Matt: 19 hits. No damage, but now it's grabbed you and shoved you up against the wall. It takes one hand and jams it up under your chin to push your head up and goes for your throat. Rolls a one. As it goes to bite your throat, you pull Pepperbox up and jam it into its mouth. It (choking). It has to pull back from the attack, and you can see now this vampire saliva is all over the barrel of the gun, and it may have chipped a tooth. All right, that finishes their turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Whoa!
Sam: Not a dream.
Marisha: Okay, I thought it was for a second.
Liam: Real vampires.
Marisha: Okay! What's the situation with the vampires? That's all of them clustered there?
Matt: There's two of them right there on Percy. They have him grabbed and shoved against the wall. There's one over here that's battling back and forth with Vax.
Marisha: Vax? Where is Percy?
Taliesin: Against the wall.
Marisha: You're against the wall. I get up. Can I reach around Scanlan, doing another reach around--
Sam: You're doing a reach-around? Okay. My dick is out.
Marisha: And I see as I reach around. I'm like, aw, really? And I'm blasting--
Sam: Little privacy, please?
Marisha: I'm blasting a Sunbeam.
Matt: At which one?
Marisha: Those two. It's a line. Are they in a line?
Matt: You're probably going to have to move to get them both in a line.
Marisha: Can I shift to where I can?
Matt: You can move there to do it, yes.
Marisha: That's what I want to do.
Matt: Okay, so you slide alongside Scanlan--
Marisha: And I yell to the party  Shield your eyes!
Sam: I instinctively cover my penis. (laughter)
Liam: Oh my goodness.
Sam: It's more important than my eyes.
Travis: Take my eyes, not my penis.
Liam: It's the third one.
Matt: Yeah, no, you were technically in melee with this guy, but there is no attack roll, so you don't have disadvantage, which is good.
Marisha: Awesome.
Matt: All right, so.
Marisha: I roll a bunch of d6s?
Matt: Well, yeah, go ahead and do that. Each creature has to make a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: How many d6s do I roll?
Matt: It's 6d8 radiant damage, and they have disadvantage on the saving throw because they are undead. So the first one-- that is a 14, nope. Second one, no. Third one-- no, rolled a one. All right, so all of them take full damage.
Marisha: Full damage. Okay, so that is 15, 19. Not bad. 21 plus 12, so that's 33 radiant damage, and they are blinded.
Sam: What? Is that true?
Matt: Okay, well. (chuckles)
Sam: (singing) Let the sun shine, let the sunshine in.
Matt: So both of these vampires currently have Percy pinned up against the wall. One of them is trying to bite his throat, and Percy's trying to keep it at bay with his weapons. Keyleth, you step forward--
Marisha: Where I can also not look at Scanlan's penis.
Matt: Right, you feel the inspiration, based on the presence of the Sun Tree, and what previously you were attempting to try and repair it with. Using that, you close your eyes and a burst of sunlight energy cascades forth, slamming into both the vampires and barely missing Percy in the process. Both of them look over out of the corner of their eye as they see the flash of light. They both scream out (screeches) as the blast shoots through both of them. Both of them immediately turn to ash and are strewn against the far wall.
Travis: Whoa! Damn!
Sam: That was so cool.
Marisha: That was cool.
Sam: Zip.
Travis: Bonus action.
Marisha: So there is one alive?
Matt: There is one alive, yes, that's right next to you.
Marisha: And he's on Vax?
Matt: Currently, yes.
Marisha: Okay, I see that. I turn and I see him, and I'm gonna take a Grasping Vine and wrap around it and yank him, trying to beat him up against the wall on the other side.
Matt: This side here?
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: Okay, is it a bonus action for Grasping Vine?
Marisha: Yes, it is.
Matt: What's the roll for that? I'm looking for the roll for Grasping Vine real fast.
Marisha: I conjure a vine-- I think it just happens.
Matt: Dexterity saving throw. With the DC, it's 17.
Marisha: Nope, 18.
Matt: 18. No, that gets it.
Matt: Damn, all right. So. It pulls it (impact sound) into the wall over that way, the vines now currently wrapped around its torso. It tries to pull itself free.
Laura: We should probably use sunlight on them always, because don't they turn into mist if we don't kill them?
Marisha: Yeah, I think so.
Matt: All right. That brings us to the top of the round. Vex and Percy, it's your go.
Laura: I don't know, should we attack him or should we let--
Travis: Stake.
Laura: Oh yeah. I bust out one of the wooden daggers. I walk up and I try to stab it into his heart. In front of my brother.
Marisha: Nice! Wood dagger!
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for a melee attack.
Laura: Okay, I still get two attacks, right?
Matt: Correct. And you're using your dexterity as the bonus. Simple weapon, which you're proficient with.
Laura: 19?
Matt: That is a 19? Does hit, yes.
Laura: Okay, then what do I do?
Matt: Roll for second attack.
Laura: Probably no. 14.
Matt: 14 does not hit. All right, so go ahead and roll 1d4. Add your dex modifier.
Laura: Nine?
Matt: All right, so you take the heavily-sharpened wooden dagger, essentially. You jam it into its chest. It screeches out in pain, the wooden stake itself partially destroyed in the process of jamming it in to do so much damage. It reaches up grabs it and breaks it off, and part of it still in its chest, goes (growling hiss). Hisses at you angrily.
Laura: Wooden stakes don't work! I back up a little bit.
Sam: You got some damage in, no? Yes? That stake was well done. Yeah! (laughter)
Travis: That was so CSI Miami, man.
Liam: Your mustache is almost down to your chin for a goatee.
Sam: Soon it will be creeping across my face.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn?
Laura: I guess so.
Matt: Yeah, that was two attacks.
Laura: Can I move away, since he's grappled?
Matt: Well, he's not currently grappled per se; he's just held against the wall. You can still move away if you want. It'll just take a swipe at you.
Laura: I'm going to stay right there.
Matt: Okay. Trinket is cheering you on (bear noises) from the back wall.
Laura: Thanks, Trinket.
Matt: Percy.
Taliesin: Is it true that we can't kill it except with sunlight?
Laura: Sunlight and water.
Matt: You're not entirely certain. You know that sunlight is very damaging to it, and from your research, you know that vampires of certain levels of power, as opposed to dying, turn into a mist form and attempt to retreat.
Marisha: They misted in.
Taliesin: I'm going to hack at his neck with my sword a couple of times.
Marisha: I wrote all that stuff down.
Taliesin: 28.
Matt: 28 hits.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: Hits.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: All right, all three hit.
Taliesin: Ten points, 15 points.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Ten points.
Matt: Ten points, got it. All right, so you slam the rapier three times into its body, leaving these large gaping wounds. It's looking like it's hurt, and its eyes are darting about, gauging its chances. That'll be your turn, unless you wish to move.
Taliesin: I'll back away from it.
Matt: Okay, so you're back there. As you back away, it sees the opportunity and reaches out with its claws towards you. That is a nine.
Taliesin: That does not hit. I'm going to really quickly also do a second wind.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Should we ask it questions or something?
Sam: Does it talk?
Taliesin: I think we should probably just kill it.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Percy. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up? I'm not ready. I guess I don't need to see it. Can I see it?
Matt: Yeah, it's right here. You're right there.
Sam: Okay. Can I do this? I will just taunt it. I will use Vicious Mockery on it, and I'll just say: What's up? What's up, toothy? Hey, bite me. That's it. That's all I do.
Matt: (chuckles) Okay.
Sam: It's 3d4.
Matt: Yeah, it is. That was about 3d4 worth.
Sam: It's all I got. I wasn't ready.
Travis: What's up, toothy? Bite me.
Sam: I think it's a wisdom.
Matt: There we go. Yeah, it's a wisdom saving throw. No, it does not make it with a six.
Liam: But his singing skill makes it very bassy and full.
Matt: So, you cast Vicious Mockery at 3rd level?
Sam: Because I'm a level 11.
Matt: It's 3d4 damage. It does take it and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll.
Sam: Can I do it at an even higher level?
Matt: No, I was thinking of another spell. Go for it.
Sam: Four, two, two. Eight!
Matt: Eight points of damage. How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Sam: That's how I want to do it. I want to do some pelvic thrusting while I'm saying it: Bite me. Bite me hard. Bite me, motherfucker, bite me!
Taliesin: Urine flying everywhere.
Sam: Oh shit, I forgot. Oh, there's urine everywhere. My mustache is falling off; it's terrible.
Matt: So as it's trying to take its chances, it turns to go ahead and flee. Sees Grog, looks over and hears you going: "Hey, toothy!" Looks over back at you. One of the weaknesses of a vampire is running water. Technically, it needs to be a large amount of running water, but this creature is on death's door and based on the fact that it is right on the edge of passing out, anyway, the bit of your--
Travis: Constellation Urine.
Matt: Yes, streaks across the front of the vampire as it turns around. Grog just instinctually slams it with the hammer and smashes it into the ground. It's hard to say which killed it, but you're pretty sure it was you.
Laura: Good job, Scanlan!
Sam: High five! (impact sound)
Travis: Chest bump! (impact sound)
Matt: Which, for the record, as you high five him, there is a bit of spatter across your hand.
Laura: Future reference, the fog is bad. Not totally natural.
Liam: Oh, there is no gnome like our gnome. Oh my gods.
Laura: Seriously, though, put your dick away.
Sam: I'm sorry. You're right, I'm sorry. Please don't judge me. It's morning, it's also unseasonably cold in here. That's why it's so small. Don't judge me.
Travis: So newsflash  the fog is bad. We probably need a new hideout.
Laura: We probably gave away our location.
Travis: Nope, no, we killed them all.
Liam: He just rolled a die.
Laura: We should probably get the fuck out.
Marisha: What time is it, midnight?
Matt: Right now it's a little after midnight.
Sam: So we have not had a full rest?
Taliesin: Let's have a full rest.
Laura: Really?
Taliesin: They don't know where we are yet. We killed everybody.
Sam: What if they have some sort of psychic communication, and what if this is their spawning ground? What if the Sun Tree is their spawning ground?
Marisha: Can I do some sort of check to see if the Sun Tree is their spawning ground?
Matt: Go ahead and make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Just a straight intelligence check?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay. That's a natural one.
Laura: Yay. Hey, that's what I rolled when I was trying to check things out.
Matt: It's hard to say. You don't understand a lot of the nature of undead; it's not your forte and things have been weird around here. You have no idea.
Liam: Here's what we're going to do. I've got one silver piece right here. I'm going to flip it.
Sam: Wait. Did you grow that mustache for tonight?
Laura: Yes.
Sam: That's awesome.
Liam: It was a goatee a scant five hours ago. Now it is an Errol Flynn mustache. Thank you. We'll discuss it at break. I'm going to flip this coin because that's all we fucking got. If it's a 20, we're gonna stay here. If it's a one, we're going to find another place.
Marisha: Sure, fuck it. Leave it up to chance.
Laura: We find another place.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: Can we tunnel our way to the tree?
Laura: Let's tunnel. I don't want to go up. No, we can't tunnel
Marisha: I can't. I blew all my natural energies doing that Sunbeam.
Liam: It's still night, though. We've had a short rest. We've got to get out of here. They know we're here.
Laura: It's night. We can't travel at night.
Travis: I know.
Liam: You're a badass.
Laura: There's vampires.
Travis: Yeah, we step outside, it's game on.
Liam: As opposed to down here in the hole?
Laura: I feel like we're safer down here. At least there's only so many places they can attack from.
Sam: But the coin said we should go.
Liam: That's fine. When you went down that cavern that one time, that worked out really well. So let's do what she says.
Marisha: Wait, are you talking about when Vex and I came back with Clarota and he helped us for quite a while? Is that what you're talking about?
Laura: That worked out really well because we probably wouldn't have defeated K'Varn without him.
Marisha: Yeah, you're right, Vax. Vex, let's stay.
Liam: That's very open to interpretation.
Travis: Until he betrayed us and tried to eat Scanlan's brain.
Taliesin: I'm agreeing with the women because I want to live to see the morning.
Sam: I still think Clarota was a pretty good guy.
Travis: We decide to stay.
Matt: All right.
Travis: We stay.
Laura: We're stupid.
Travis: No we're not. We'll be fine.
Laura: What if we went up above ground and went into the second floor? So we're not underground.
Sam: All right, sure, let's do that. That's no good, either.
Marisha: Are there two stories? I technically used my Hallucinatory Terrain spell to make it look like a one-story tavern.
Sam: What about this? How about we don't sleep in the tunnel? We barricade that up and we just sleep in the cellar. Not the tunnel, the cellar.
Laura: All right, let's do it. It's fine, whatever.
Liam: Back and to the left.
Sam: Can we barricade the cellar somehow?
Marisha: That I can do. I'll do a Wall of Stone where I tunneled.
Laura: We're very packed in. It's nice and cozy and warm.
Matt: It is, and you're surrounded by a number of bottles of wine--
Liam: And bear farts.
Taliesin: And all the wine we stole. We stole a lot of wine.
Marisha: Can we pop open a bottle of that wine?
Taliesin: And try and relax?
Travis: Yeah, we can. I guess I'll allow it.
Matt: Pop open the wine, share a bottle, and you all manage to find your way back to sleep. Who's taking watch now?
Marisha: I'll go with Vax because I haven't been yet.
Matt: Okay, so you two take the next watch.
Laura: I stay awake because I don't want them to be alone.
Matt: (chuckles) All right, the three of you take this watch.
Marisha: Half-elves, what what.
Sam: I go back to sleep.
Travis: Half-elves, what what.
Liam: Hello, my half-elven brothers.
Matt: All right, a few hours of awkward conversation--
Liam: (shushing noises) Jeralt is speaking.
Matt: It's Geralt, thank you very much.
Laura: Sigil.
Liam: I haven't played that game, but is your name Solid Snake?
Matt: I will attack both of you.
Marisha: Cue internet rage.
Matt: (laughs) Oh man. All right, so after you guys take your watch, with seeming no incident, although some awkward conversation and a few jabs here and there. Final watch, who's taking that?
Sam: I've already watched.
Laura: I need to sleep. You need to sleep.
Travis: Fuck it, I'll do it.
Matt: All right, Grog is up.
Laura: Trinket stays awake with you, though.
Matt: And Trinket does like staying awake with you, Grog. You both understand each other on a very feral and unintelligent level.
Travis: We play hand slaps. (impact sound) Fuck. Claws catching every once in a while.
Matt: Eventually, everyone's managed to gather your evening's rest. You come to consciousness, the cold morning greets you. No seeming further incident in the cellar during the evening.
Travis: You're welcome.
Matt: I would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw, please.
Travis: No problem.
Taliesin: Wisdom saving or just wisdom?
Matt: Wisdom saving throw.
Marisha: Saving throw? Oh right, because we've been in a cursed land for a while.
Sam: Does my thing help me?
Matt: Your thing help you?
Sam: I have some thing.
Liam: The cube?
Marisha: Jack-of-all-trades?
Sam: No, shit. I'll find it. Don't worry, come back to me.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 17.
Laura: 17.
Travis: 11.
Sam: What is this? Wisdom?
Matt: Wisdom saving throw.
Sam: Advantage.
Matt: There you go.
Sam: 14.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth?
Marisha: 24.
Taliesin: Eight.
Marisha: Oh, not Percy!
Laura: Oh, not Percy!
Travis: You don't know.
Marisha: Oh god, look at that smirk on his face!
Taliesin: Fuck you, Matt.
Matt: So as you all come to consciousness, I would like you to put another point of corruption on your sheet.
Laura: Oh no, how many can you get before you're totally evil?
Marisha: What does that mean? Now what?
Matt: Tell you in a second.
Taliesin: Am I still coughing?
Matt: Oh, you're still coughing. You guys all come back to consciousness. Cold morning greets you. Food probably is going to be in order pretty soon. You guys didn't get much of a meal the evening before, and you're all still a little sore after your evening's rest. You've pushed through and recovered from your exhaustion from your frenzied rage.
Travis: Thank you.
Sam: Ring of Mind-Shielding, is what I was going to say.
Taliesin: That mustache is getting very iffy.
Sam: I don't know what you're talking about.
Travis: Do we want some dried food rations?
Laura: Plus, there's probably dried food in this cellar.
Travis: I have a ton in the bag.
Marisha: Can we do a check to see if there's any jerky or anything in the cellar? Did we already do that?
Matt: You guys looked through. You found some jerky, some dried food that's serviceable. Not the best, but serviceable. All right. Going forward, the sadistic tendencies that you've been exerting through a lot of this event are becoming harder and harder to control. Be mindful that when you strike to kill, you strike to torture before you do.
Sam: Whoa, that's so cool. I mean terrible.
Laura: Is he the only one that was affected this time, again?
Matt: Yep. Everyone else rolled above a ten.
Taliesin: I have a very low wisdom, and I rolled really badly.
Matt: All right, so. You finish your meal. Looking outside, what little bit of the windows you can see, since you covered them all with cloth, there's a little bit of daylight peeking through. It's soft daylight. It looks like, while it's not raining, there is still a cloud-covered sky. What is your plan of action?
Travis: I have a question. My 11 points of permanently lowered hit points from the necrotic damage, can that be healed with a potion of greater healing?
Matt: Those hit points have all come back, by the way, guys. Over the night, the hit points you lost on your hit point total have been returned.
Liam: I didn't suffer from this, but permanently lowered health?
Matt: Yeah, from the bite? That recovers after a long rest.
Travis: Literally what I just asked.
Sam: What about the hit points that were lowered?
Travis: Literally what I just asked.
Matt: What? Don't-- My brain doesn't work-- (laughs) It's hot in here.
Travis: Are we going to find another house to kill now? I mean, to carefully investigate and thoroughly due diligence the heads before we smash them.
Liam: Scanlan, I think you and I going to go see how people are feeling in the town while everybody else looks for a new hidey-hole, yeah?
Marisha: Are we tunneling through this entire city?
Liam: I think you are, but if it's first thing in the morning, I don't think the Briarwoods could have gotten to everybody yet, so I think you and I could do our father-son act for like an hour.
Sam: Did you just say fart the son act?
Liam: Fart the son and the vampires, they're done-- father and son.
Sam: Oh, father and son. Oh! Seeming!
Liam: Because you're little, and I'm tall.
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: Why don't we Seem all of us so we can go take a look around while you talk to--
Travis: Yeah, we've got to find a different spot.
Liam: Quickly, though, because even though we don't look like ourselves, they know that there are strangers in town.
Laura: Grog, give everybody a little bit of the Dust of Tracelessness.
Taliesin: And we have the earpieces.
Sam: Do we? Do you?
Taliesin: I have one now.
Marisha: I have one.
Liam: I have one.
Sam: Okay. So I am to Seem us as peasants again?
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Same peasants, yes.
Travis: Different-looking peasants.
Sam: (sings) Seeming. Feel me, touch me, heal me.
Liam: Sorry, folks.
Sam: All right, so we're all peasants.
Matt: Gnome bard wizard over here.
Sam: I'm a cute little boy with a lazy eye. To match my grandma.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: I have the Hat of Disguise on underneath, just so even if it drops, I'm still not me.
Matt: Okay, good to know. All right.
Marisha: So are we breaking up? Are you two going to scout the town and the rest of us will--
Liam: We're going to talk to a few people, right, kiddo?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: The rest of us are finding a new hideout?
Laura: Yeah, we're looking for a new hideout.
Taliesin: Where should we meet?
Marisha: We've got the earrings.
Taliesin: We've got the earrings, so once we find a place, we'll let you know.
Liam: We'll come to you, yeah.
Laura: Check in every 30 minutes. It's dangerous.
Marisha: Okay. I like that plan.
Travis: What's the safety word?
Sam: I'd leave that up to Percy.
Marisha: I was going to say I'd leave that up to you.
Laura: Meet back here in two hours--
Liam: Too long.
Laura: Hold on. Meet back here in two hours if we haven't heard from everything.
Taliesin: If everything goes wrong, we meet back here in two hours. Otherwise, check in every 30 minutes. Do we need a code word?
Sam: Yeah, we need a code word.
Travis: Doritos.
Laura: I was thinking Dorito, too! How weird.
Travis: Married.
Marisha: Dorito. I like that.
Matt: Dorito. A strange elven term for flatmate. All right, so, as you guys press out into the day's sun, we'll take a quick break. We'll be back here in five minutes to continue this.
Marisha: Hot. I might have to de-armor.
Travis: I'm taking this wig off.
Matt: See you guys shortly. [break]
Zac: Hey, what's up, everybody? Welcome back. Real quick, couple announcements, the first of which: tomorrow, here on Geek and Sundry, we have a special episode of Group Hug; it's going to be Alien versus Predator versus the Alien Queen. Cthulhu might be thrown in there. We're still working out the details, but we're going to kick off Halloween. It's going to be pretty rad. And the chat room bought those figures for us, so we're going to play with them, and it's going to be awesome. And then after that, we have a really awesome band tomorrow night, and they're going to be coming in costume, and then we've got the game Nightmare on VHS.
Matt: Oh, yeah! I used to have that, man.
Zac: Yeah. We're going to be rocking out Nightmare tomorrow night, and Felicia's probably going to be stopping by, and Ryon Day. We're going to have a big old Halloween party with Rock Band and everything else. So you guys are more than welcome to join us and celebrate Halloween.
Matt: You should be Baron Samedi for that one.
Zac: Baron Samedi?
Matt: He's one of the characters you can play in that. God, that thing was so awful. It's going to be so great.
Zac: It's so bad-good. I cannot wait.
Matt: Whose turn is it? You. You are banished. Oh, that guy was so good.
Zac: I can't wait, guys, so tune in for that. And for all the people last week that voted for me to have sideburns and a Freddie Mercury mustache, I have kept both all week, and tomorrow I will not have to anymore, so thank you for that. I love you guys. You're great. Good times, good job. That's all I have to say.
Matt: (laughs) Man, Nightmare. That's almost as good as Experience Bij. All right, so. Quick announcement we have for you guys right now, as well. Tonight's episode, if you haven't seen from the setup, is actually sponsored by Tor Books, which is awesome. If you guys aren't familiar with Tor, you need to go check out what they have. I grew up reading a lot of the stuff that Tor published. They're one of the major publishers of science fiction and fantasy out there. They've been going for a long time. I was raised on a lot of their spectrum. Right now, they're pushing the awesome New York best-selling book Shadows of Self. Yes. That's the one. Which Felicia really, really enjoyed, and if you guys have the opportunity to go check it out, please do so. Their stuff is awesome. So thank you, Tor. I think that's it. So if everyone's back here, let's go ahead and-- oh, there he is. I was waiting for Burt to return.
Sam: I didn't want to disturb your announcements.
Travis: Sit down, you dickless wonder.
Matt: Oh, it's a sleeping monkey.
Sam: Easy, Helga. You meant nothing to me.
Travis: (laughs) Oh?
Liam: Still so little expression on that face.
Sam: I don't know what you're saying. I can perform perfectly.
Travis: I've moved on from Scanlan, and I've cut my hair as a sign of change.
Liam: Like Vasquez.
Laura: Yeah, I like it.
Travis: Yeah, Aliens. Such a badass, Vasquez.
Marisha: I've taken my scarf off because it's really hot. It's really hot in here.
Matt: You ever been mistaken for a man? Come on, you've got to know the response to that.
Laura: No, have you?
Matt: Thank you, Laura.
Laura: You got it.
Matt: Grog has disadvantage on his next attack. (groaning)
Laura: And Vex has advantage?
Matt: Yeah, probably. We'll see when we get there. All right, so.
Liam: (explosion noise)
Matt: Down. (laughs) I will Quen all over your ass. I got Aard signs all day, yo. All right, anyway. So. What are the groups? You guys are splitting up across the city?
Laura: Oh, right. Yes.
Sam: Is that a thing? Are we doing this?
Laura: This is the dumbest idea, by the way.
Travis: No, it's the best.
Liam: Daddy Daycare. You and I, we're going to go talk to people.
Sam: Papa, let's go.
Laura: Keyleth, you and me.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: No, the four of us are sticking together, I thought.
Laura: All right. And Trinket.
Taliesin: Trinket the donkey.
Sam: Oh, yes.
Taliesin: We'll go to the Alcove.
Travis: We're going to the Alcove.
Matt: Good. So.
Liam: What was the name of the guy that Grog de-tongued and kicked out the window?
Sam: Kerrion.
Travis: Kerrion.
Marisha: That was Vox.
Matt: He was shot in the face by Percy. This was Vouk.
Travis: Got it.
Liam: Thanks.
Sam: So Vouk is alive?
Laura: And I'm sure he told everybody what we looked like. We can't look like the same Seeming that we were before.
Taliesin: He can only tell them what we look like if he's a very clever artist.
Laura: Yeah, but he can write it down.
Travis: He's really good at charades.
Marisha: But they already know what we look like.
Travis: Should've broken his fingers, too.
Laura: Seeming.
Marisha: I thought we dropped Seeming, though?
Laura: We didn't.
Sam: Would I have been smart enough to Seem us slightly differently?
Matt: Based on this conversation happening now? No. You have already transformed everybody into the original--
Sam: Except I gave myself a lazy eye.
Matt: Except you have a lazy eye, which is different.
Liam: I don't think it makes a difference. I think there's no new people in this town.
Marisha: True. Even newer people might be suspicious.
Travis: We don't give a fuck. We're walking around. We don't give a shit. You people have got lazy eyes. We've got a donkey. No problem. Recognize us, I dare you.
Laura: I have crazy eyes.
Matt: Yeah, you do. Crazy old woman eyes.
Laura: They're like (growls).
Matt: Just like that.
Liam: But you guys are tunneling around, looking for new digs, right?
Marisha: No, we're walking around.
Sam: Well, that's up to them.
Liam: That's up to you. I thought-- who cares what I thought?
Matt: Indeed. So you and Scanlan continue off into the city.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on them before they leave. On all of us.
Matt: Okay. All right. There is a radius to it, I believe.
Laura: Oh, there is?
Matt: They have to stay within a certain area of you.
Laura: I really should read about spells more.
Matt: I can just look it up right here. I would do that, yeah. I would recommend looking up your spells.
Laura: Oh, within 30 feet of me.
Taliesin: What part of town is the Alcove?
Matt: The Alcove would be on the northwest side of it.
Liam: She's not even here. You're with me. Gavroche, come on! And I swat him as hard as I can in the back of the head.
Sam: Thenardier is our precious father.
Matt: The four of you head off towards the Alcove. Heading out into the day, the cloud cover is pretty thick. There is just general moisture and mist to the air. It probably could rain any second. You continue moving towards the northwestern side of the town. You do notice, in comparison to previous days, there is a little more energy to the streets. People seem to be moving back and forth with hustle and business. You do also see, as you head on your way out, there is still a slight bit of smoke slowly swimming up from the house in the distance, and what minor embers were not put out by the rainfall, it's just a little trace of smoke.
Taliesin: Was it the north, the east, or the west manor?
Matt: That was the eastern.
Taliesin: Eastern manor.
Matt: Yeah, that one is partially burned down. So as you continue heading northwest, you eventually make your way to where you recall the Alcove was. Now, when you get there, it's a relatively plain-looking building. Dark woods. There's a sign out front that says The Alcove. It's old. The metal that holds the sign has rusted a bit. The doors are open, and as you push into the building, it's largely empty and seemingly unkempt, compared to the previous oddity shops you've been to. Many books about enchantment look left out on one of the nearby tables, partially read and abandoned as if they were being flipped through. And then as you look across the room, behind the counter, there's a young girl in her late teens, a blonde waif of a girl, who's currently thumbing through a book and notices you guys enter. "Oh! Hi. Can I help you?"
Taliesin: Yes, we're looking to buy a few things, and we were wondering-- actually, I used to do business with Simon. Is Simon around?
Matt: "Simon was called away for a special project by the Briarwoods about six months ago. He told me to look over the store while he's gone. I'm sorry, we're mostly out of stock. We don't have much here at the moment."
Taliesin: He was called away on a special project? What sort of special project?
Matt: "I don't know. He lives in the castle now. I mean, he would visit every week or so, but he hasn't been back in almost a month, and I'm a little worried."
Travis: He lives at the castle?
Taliesin: He lives at the castle? Oh.
Marisha: Did he ever tell you about any details of this special assignment?
Matt: "No, unfortunately. He was the real enchanter here. I'm just trying to do my best to learn what I can while he's gone."
Laura: Speak up, girl! I can't hear you. MATT "I'm sorry, miss! I'm sorry. I'm Jordana Whisk. I'm Simon's daughter."
Laura: Simon's daughter. Now, did he like the Briarwoods?
Matt: She gives you a look and looks about the room for a moment. "The Briarwoods have been very fair and just rulers of this land."
Laura: I'm trying to look straight at her, but I'm really looking that direction and over there.
Matt: She's gathered as much and is seemingly offput by the whole presentation. "The Briarwoods are just and fair, and we should not speak ill of them in public."
Travis: Can somebody see if there's something watching?
Marisha: Yeah, can I do a perception check around the room and see if there's any indications that the Briarwoods might have--
Travis: Monitoring?
Marisha: Yeah, a bug? Like some sort of something where they might be monitoring this place.
Sam: A small electronic device.
Marisha: Yes. That kind of bug.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: Not bad. 26.
Matt: Looking around the room, there doesn't appear to be any specific devices installed, whether magical or otherwise, that would pertain to immediate--
Travis: No blue poo. Got it.
Laura: (whispering) Lean in, girl. Lean in.
Matt: She leans in a little bit and goes, "Hold on." And she runs off behind the counter. Heads back and closes the doors behind where you guys entered. Heads back and gets behind the counter. "I'm sorry. I don't recognize any of you, and you're bringing up rather dangerous statements. What can I help you with? We don't have much." And she reaches down and pulls out a couple of small glass vials. Simple healing potions, you can already see. You've worked with these type of things before.
Taliesin: We're actually looking for something a bit more complicated and a little more dangerous.
Matt: She pulls up a small metal rod. "One of these?"
Taliesin: I don't know what that is. Let me show you. And I'm going to walk over to the wall, find a dusty wall, and I'm going to trace the symbol on the wall.
Matt: Okay. She gives you a look and says, "It's dangerous to draw that around here, sir."
Taliesin: I'm going to wipe it away.
Matt: She gets a little more comfortable as soon as you do. "What are you doing here?"
Taliesin: We're hoping that we could purchase a brief amount of sanctuary.
Matt: "Here? Why?"
Taliesin: We need to keep moving so that they don't catch us.
Matt: "The Briarwoods are after you? I can't have you here! You'll bring them right to me!"
Laura: Dear, the Briarwoods aren't after us. They're after everybody. What we need is a place to stay that we know is protected.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: (growls) Eight is-- 16.
Sam: 80 60?
Laura: 80 60.
Matt: Yes, big number. It's a very large die.
Taliesin: Can I try and pour on top of it?
Matt: I'd say no. Not at this point. You're the one that originally spurred her worry. She gives you a look. "Look, if I'm going to let you stay here, I need to know more about what it is that you're trying to accomplish here. Raising the symbol of the de Rolos? I've never seen any of you in the city before in my life."
Laura: Do you miss the de Rolos, dear?
Matt: "Anything's better than this misery."
Laura: Well, we may know a couple de Rolos. We may know some. No big deal.
Marisha: It's true.
Matt: She shakes her head and, "Foolish minds. The de Rolos have been dead for five years."
Taliesin: Not all of them.
Matt: "Really?"
Taliesin: I can't drop the Seeming, can I?
Marisha: (laughing) No, you're stuck.
Travis: Just drop that phat name of yours, buddy.
Laura: Only one person would know the entire name of Percival de Rolo.
Marisha: Miss, do you know the full name of Percival de Rolo?
Taliesin: I was wondering if you were about to do it. Can you do it?
Travis: Yeah, it's Museldorf Musketeers--
Sam: Percival Sanchez Vicario--
Laura: de Rolo III.
Liam: The Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria.
Marisha: Percival Von Musel Von Lichtenstein de Rolo III.
Sam: Kevin Dorff, Wesley Snipes.
Laura: Magneto de Rolo III.
Marisha: de Rolo III.
Matt: This moment of tension with Jordana awkwardly staring at these all very intently looking dirty peasants. With a donkey. Just talking about names.
Taliesin: Simon Whisk was a good friend to Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.
Marisha: That's it.
Taliesin: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.
Marisha: Percival Fredricks Von Stein--
Travis: You can call him Percy.
Taliesin: Percival lives, and he's coming.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll. [no audio]
Matt: And one you're not sure the nature of, and says, "Take these." And she pushes them ahead to you. "It's not much." Two regular healing potions, one greater healing potion. She explains what the metal thing is. She picks it up and clicks part of the metal cusp of it, and it stays in the air on its own.
Marisha: Oh my god! It's another Rod of Holding.
Matt: Immovable Rod, but yes.
Marisha: Immovable Rod. That one. I was combining Bag of Holding and the Immovable Rod. Combining them.
Sam: What's a movable rod?
Laura: Two greater healing and then another regular?
Matt: One greater healing and two regular.
Liam: It's like a ladder rung that you can put wherever you want and hang on it.
Sam: Did we already have one of those?
Marisha: Yeah, we did.
Sam: What happened to it?
Marisha: Tiberius put it somewhere, and it never came back.
Sam: He put it on the magic carpet?
Marisha: He might have. Tiberius had one. We didn't use it much.
Liam: He's a mysterious motherfucker.
Matt: All right. She pushes it all towards you guys and says, "I have practically no one, and I can't be much help. I'm not a fighter."
Marisha: I'll take the rod.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: I will make sure that you are compensated when this is over. Can we sleep here for the night?
Matt: "Follow me." She leads you to the back, and there's this very, very small room that looks like it used to be her father's room. It's dusty. Most of it has been untouched, except for the bed. She walks in. "This is all I have to offer. It's not much, but it's available."
Laura: Is it safe at night?
Matt: "As safe as anything is here. Just don't go outside."
Travis: What does the ceiling look like?
Matt: It's about nine feet up. Maybe about two feet of rafters. Very simple. Very plain.
Travis: That's where we need to be tonight. Remember when we were in the branches?
Laura: Can I insight check her and see if she seems to be truthful?
Matt: Sure, go for it.
Laura: I never know which one. It's too much pressure to choose. That was the wrong one. I chose poorly. 13.
Matt: Okay. It's hard to tell. She's young, and she seems definitely earnest and plain with her forthrightness. Yeah, there doesn't appear to be any sort of deception.
Travis: We are allies. With us comes change. Keep our secret and all the better we'll be for it.
Matt: "It's kept, but I recommend talking to Keeper Yennen if you haven't. He's one of the social centerpieces of the remaining good folk in the city."
Taliesin: We have spoken to him. We will speak to him again today.
Matt: His reach is far. He'd be the one to talk to. Well, don't stay here long. That will draw attention.
Marisha: Also, we're going to have two more staying with us, if that's okay.
Laura: One's a child, though. You won't even notice him.
Matt: Her shoulders slump a little bit. She's like, "All right. I'll prepare as best I can." And she starts reaching over and starts pulling these thin blankets out from a nearby cabinet and goes, "Well? Go!"
Taliesin: Good day. Everyone, let's meet over at the Lady's Chamber once you're finished with your business.
Matt: All right, now you guys.
Liam: I'm dragging you along by the scruff of the ear.
Sam: Pa, please!
Liam: Shut up.
Sam: I'm tired.
Liam: I'm going to look for anybody walking by. Is there anyone nearby?
Matt: After about a minute or so of walking, you do see what looks to be a young man carrying a satchel over his shoulder. It looks like it's filled with a few small pieces of parchment that are rolled up. He's in a brisk walk somewhere.
Liam: I walk right up to him and I awkwardly put a hand on his chest, and I make sure that I flip my pencil and spit as I talk and say, I need a hard drink. I need a hard drink right now. Where?
Matt: "If you're looking for a drink," And he points over down the road, and he's really put off by it and is trying to keep his face out of your breath. "You're going to look for the Journey's End. Two blocks down that way, to the right. It's not much business during the day."
Liam: I spit at his feet and I pull Scanlan by the ear. Come on, you shit.
Sam: (yelps) Call Child Protective Services!
Matt: As you walk away, you hear him mutter under his breath, "What's this world coming to?" And he continues on his brusque pace.
Liam: I'm following his directions and going there. Journey's End, yeah.
Matt: You are now at the Journey's End tavern. It's pretty barren. You walk inside. There are two employees. One who is behind the bar and is currently reading through a book. The second is currently pouring a drink for the one patron that's in there, what looks to be a slovenly looking gentleman who's sitting at a table drinking his woes away. He's currently going through what looks like a ledger of some kind, and there's a tavern employee with an apron on. He's this younger, red-headed boy, who's trying to fill a flagon while this gentleman at the table is cursing at him to the side. Other than that, it's empty.
Liam: Empty. So how many in here?
Matt: Three.
Liam: Three. All right, I pull Jimmy-John after me, and sit down next to one of them.
Sam: My name is Tad.
Liam: Shut up! Your mother's going to kill us both. (sighs) Two! Two here, and a water for him.
Matt: "All right. Okay, I'll be right back," and he walks off, looking a little confused.
Sam: I'll have one of what he's having, as well.
Matt: (chuckles) "That's cute. Water it is." And he's walking off.
Liam: I swat him in the back of the head for the bartender to see.
Matt: The patron now, a closer look  man in his late forties. Has a protruded jawline, little bit of an underbite. Thinning brown hair, and he's got some smears of dirt on his face. Looks like he's been crying, and is slumped over the table, looking over this ledger. He slams it shut as you sit down with a very, very loud (impact noise). Glances sidelong towards you and says, "What the fuck are you doing coming and bothering a man in the middle of his meal?"
Liam: Can't fucking earn a living in this land. Come up from a mile out of town, been trying to grow fucking carrots for these fucking people. Can't earn a living!
Matt: "You're telling me. Ain't no living to be had in Whitestone these days. It's nothing but misery."
Liam: Something's got to change here. I can't live. I can't give them what they want. I can't feed him. What are we fucking supposed to do here?
Sam: I haven't eaten in three days.
Matt: "That's the worst fucking part, is you know there's always an easy exit."
Sam: What?
Matt: "What, you think the folks who've taken their life to this point? You think that's the end, but no, not in this town. No, they just get right back up the next day. There is no way out."
Liam: The fuck are you talking about?
Matt: "Talking about the whole business. There is no escaping this misery. Either you try and stay alive and exist in this bullshit, or you die and become one of them. I've been trying to find a way out of this city for months now, but they're always watching."
Liam: I take a huge drink of the mug in front of me. (sighs) Someone should run these fuckers out of town.
Matt: "That ain't going to happen, mate. Sorry."
Sam: I have a friend named Kevin. He says there is someone trying to do something about it. He says that that's what caused that fire yesterday, over at that big fancy house. He says there's rebels afoot!
Liam: I take the mug that I have, and I pour the rest of it out on this little one's head and say, you speak when you're spoken to.
Matt: "No, it's okay. Let the boy speak. Let your boy speak! What were you saying?"
Sam: Oh, I'm just saying what I overheard. My friend Kevin, he's truthful. When he lies, his papa beats him, so I believe him. He said that someone really strong took out someone who was at that big fancy house that was all aflame the other day. He said that there's lots of them, and that they're going to free us all from this hell we live in!
Matt: (laughing) Man, that's a layered check. Make a persuasion and a deception roll, back to back.
Sam: Wait, two rolls?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: It was that good.
Sam: Okay, persuasion and deception, you say. Oh Jesus. Okay, persuasion. 39. (laughter)
Taliesin: What?!
Laura: How?! Is that even possible?
Sam: Deception, 15. Wait, or 29. It's a lot.
Matt: What's your bonus?!
Sam: No, it's 16 plus 13.
Matt: Okay, so 29.
Sam: That's 29. Sorry. It's a lot.
Matt: I was like, (explosion sounds). All right. Gives you a stern look. "Huh. Well, it'd be nice, for a change, that there'd be someone up to fucking fight for this shithole of a place."
Liam: I start fake-weeping into my cup.
Matt: He goes, "Oh no. No need for that. Going to make me lose my appetite. Hate the sound of a grown man crying. Chin up!" And he takes and flicks a coin at your face.
Liam: Ow, fuck!
Matt: "Look, if what he's saying's true, and we've got some sort of savior making their way into town, well. Let's hope they're at least a little more prepared than the last ones."
Sam: The last ones?
Matt: "The uprising three years ago. Are you new to this fucking town?"
Sam: Three years ago, Papa wouldn't let me out of the closet, so I didn't hear much of what was going on.
Matt: "Okay, first and foremost, you've got to treat your boy better. Going to raise someone no better than the motherfuckers running Whitestone right now if you keep this up."
Liam: (retches)
Laura: Did you really puke, or did you fake puke?
Sam: I'm sorry about my papa. He's had such a hard time these last few years. Our crops are not performing well, and he's under a lot of pressure. And I think Mama doesn't love him anymore. I'm sorry. We can go.
Matt: "I think you should. But one thing  if he ever does anything else to hurt you again, you come tell someone. Two: if you hear anything else about this savior coming into town, go ahead and talk to Trevor over there, at the edge of the bar." And you see over there, there's the guy who's behind the bar with his book. He doesn't even notice all this happening. Guy in his mid-thirties, glasses at the end of his nose, his hair's slicked back and pulled into a taut ponytail, and he's sitting there reading. And he says, "Go ahead and tell Trevor, because the rest of us would like to go out in a blaze of glory than live in this bullshit."
Sam: What was your name, sir?
Matt: "Not important to much, but you can call me Patrick."
Sam: Thank you, Patrick. I don't know if my papa has enough money for these drinks.
Liam: I'm going to insight check Patrick.
Sam: From the floor?
Matt: He's listening in. Go for it.
Liam: All right, that's not that great. That's a 17.
Matt: He seems honest. Seems he's got not much to lose and his interest is piqued, but he's not wholly invested in this whole idea. But it's definitely caught his attention. "Well, let's get him up." Stands up, reaches over and grabs you by the arm, lifts you up onto the stool on the side of the table and says, "Up, you." Pats you on the back. "You need to sober up, drink the water you got for your boy, there, and get your ass out of here."
Sam: Come on, Papa. Let's go. I turn around and I take the rest of his drink. (laughter)
Liam: And as he pulls me away, and I slovenly turn after him. I turn back for a second, and I completely sober up. Pelor has returned. Walked out.
Matt: He gives you a keen glance and nods slowly as you walk away. Looks over at the bartender for a second, and, "Psst! Trevor!" And then you exit the building. All right, you guys all convene at the Lady's Chamber. The other day, there were a few folks walking through the courtyard. Today, there's a group of about 25 people, all different dress, from what would be considered a Whitestone middle class, the few there are, to a number of other peasantry, farmhands, and other folk that look destitute by nature of existence here. All gathered in the amphitheater, and what appears to be a relatively hushed sermon or discussion currently going on by Keeper Yennen.
Marisha: Let's not make ourselves known. I want to see this. I want to hear what's up.
Taliesin: Sit in the back.
Matt: Okay, sit in the back. He begins talking for a while about a long tangent, speaking of, "This land, once cherished, is a burning light and a beacon of good existence, of kinship, of honesty and loyalty, dragged down to the muck by the imposition of darkness, the return of the evil that once scourged this land. Now given new faces, they push us down, and as hope crumbles, the light peeks through once again, for whispers have come to my ears, friends, that this unrest now has a name. I'm sure you've seen it, the fire atop that building this morning, watched as one of your oppressors was cut from his high throne. One of his close advisors scarred, tortured, shown the strength of this hidden ally of us, the oppressed peoples of Whitestone." And he looks up over the group a little bit and past the streets, carefully. "I have come to believe that perhaps this is the time for us to band together and show our support. Now, the information is still vague, but just keep your eyes open. Be careful, be quiet. As things progress, word will find you." Bows his head and says a prayer that-- none of you speak Celestial?
Taliesin: I do.
Sam: You do?!
Taliesin: I speak Celestial.
Matt: All righty. The essence of the prayer is  By the guidance of the Lady, may civilization flourish and those that keep progression at bay be squashed beneath our feet. At which point the sermon breaks, and people begin to walk away and scatter.
Laura: I want to watch people as they walk away and try to read their lips as they're walking away to see if everybody seems loyal to what he said, or if anybody seems a little--
Matt: Everyone is silent. Everyone is quiet, and everyone is looking warily and making their own separate paced exits, so as not to draw attention.
Laura: Can we try to memorize their faces? Of everybody that was here?
Matt: Okay. You keep as best a mental image of everyone who's passing by. Not too many notable folk. They look like, especially where you're from, the peasantry doesn't really interest you visually, but you do manage to gather details of certain scars here and there, and people, hair color, age, stuff like that.
Travis: Did we recognize the guy that was talking?
Laura: Yeah, that was Keeper.
Matt: Keeper Yennen.
Marisha: Yeah. Any familiar faces in the audience?
Matt: Actually, Scanlan, you and Keyleth both recognize some of the farmers. You guys have all gathered.
Sam: Oh, we gathered again. Okay.
Matt: You recognize two of the individuals at this were the farmers you initially saw on the outskirts of Whitestone when you did your little scouting mission earlier.
Sam: Oh, nice. When we flew in?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: So from all the people you've encountered, those are the only two that you specifically recognize so far, but it does appear to be made up of--
Marisha: Working hands, farmers.
Matt: Yeah, the foundation of this city that have been so long oppressed.
Travis: I elbow Percy, and I go, do we talk to him?
Taliesin: I think we do. Maybe he talks to us. I try and catch his attention.
Matt: Okay. You can see as he begins putting out some of the incense, he looks over and sees, "Ah, yes. You've returned. Please, follow me." And he steps outside of the amphitheater and around the back of it.
Taliesin: We follow.
Matt: Okay. Around the back of the amphitheater, you see there is constructed, attached to the very far end of this round half-dome, a square brick building. Very simple. And as he ushers you all inside, it's essentially a tea room. There's a table, there's a tea set up there, there is a small stove in the far end with a little fire-burning stove, and shelves and shelves and shelves arranged with all different manner of small sculptures, metalwork, holy symbols of Erathis that have all been put on display. Each one has a name carved beneath it. And you recognize this, Percy. This is the legacy of all the Keepers of the Lady's Chamber over time, their symbols. This is basically a Hall of Previous Keepers. "Please, sit. Have tea if you like, if you're so interested. We have much to discuss. So. I am to believe that these allies you spoke of previously were responsible for this dastardly attack on Sir Kerrion?"
Taliesin: That could be inferred.
Matt: "Well, I have spoken privately with a number of the remaining community leaders of our town, and they are unconvinced. Understand, this isn't the first time an insurrection has been attempted, and much sorrow was endured after previous failures. We keep hope best we can, but without a solid plan, we are sending the rest of our able-bodied into the abyss."
Taliesin: What happened last time?
Matt: "Well, in a similar fashion, we had a number of fed-up individuals decide to finally raise some sort of aggressive act against the castle and attempt to storm it by force. We figured we had the numbers. There are many dangers in that castle that go beyond what we were prepared for. As such, the few that survived, well. They met the fate most do at the Sun Tree these days. So we've been remiss to put ourselves in a similar position for many years now. To make matters worse, our informant within the castle has gone silent these past few weeks. We have no idea of the progression of the Briarwoods' plot."
Marisha: Was your informant by chance named Simon?
Matt: "No. Simon has been missing for some time, actually."
Taliesin: Who was your informant?
Matt: "I don't know the name. The information comes through-- actually, he should be arriving here in just a moment."
Taliesin: What did they find underneath Whitestone?
Matt: "All that we know is they've been rebuilding or repurposing something old and terrible beneath the city. I've only heard whispers of it referred to as the ziggurat."
Laura: The ziggurat.
Travis: The ziggurat.
Marisha: The ziggurat.
Matt: "Now, to go into the deep history of this city, as you are outsiders, legend speaks of a seed, that the Sun Tree was placed by Pelor himself to seal a wound in the light. Whitestone rose around it. The fable has long been told, but ever since those fiends took the city, their interest beneath the city has kept me thinking on this fable. Leaves me very unsettled. And as the Sun Tree slowly died, so did our confidence. Further--" At which point, the door across the room opens. (creak) And another enters the room. A very elderly man steps in, his ragged robes draped on his very thin, frail form.
Laura: I wink at him.
Matt: His weathered skin is dark and leathery. He's nearly hairless on his head and has liver spots all over his scalp. One of his eyes is clouded over and white. He shimmies in very slowly. "I ask you strangers, what makes you so sure you can change the tide of this battle?"
Travis: (whispers) Drop Seeming. Drop it.
Taliesin: Do I recognize this person?
Matt: As old as he may be, there is a subtle power and resonance and confidence to his voice. There's a force of personality and conviction that immediately leads you to believe that this man is or once was a man of great power and respect.
Travis: Are there windows in the room?
Matt: There are two windows. They are currently shut with curtains.
Travis: You should show him.
Matt: You, Percy, recognize this man. He was once the chancellor to your father, and a long-respected philosopher in Whitestone known as Archibald Desnae.
Marisha: Archibald Desnitt?
Matt: Desnae. He was very well-respected. Very stern, and crotchety at times, but very much aided your family in holding the city together in times of strife.
Sam: I pull out Sir Kerrion's notebook and I hand it to them and I say, this should be some proof that we mean what we say.
Matt: Reaches out, and his long, spindly fingers wrap around the tome, pull it towards him. "So you bring a trinket. That is helpful. But to kill one mortal man is no feat compared to the darkness that lies in that castle. You need more than that."
Taliesin: I remove my hat.
Sam: Can I drop it on one of us, or do I have to drop it on all of us?
Matt: I'd say you can drop it on an individual, if you prefer.
Sam: All right. I will drop Percy's Seeming.
Matt: Okay. There's a slamming sound as the tome he's holding hits the floor.
Taliesin: Hello, Archie.
Matt: "Percival? Sweet Percival."
Taliesin: Not so sweet these days. I did not think you would have lived.
Matt: "I thought you had perished in the subjugation. Percival, you have no idea the joy this brings to my heart." And he reaches out and touches the edge of your face like he's still in disbelief. "Your hair. It seems age has caught up to you, as well."
Taliesin: It was difficult, leaving.
Matt: You see a smile creep across his very tense old-man face, and he looks about the room with a renewed energy that wasn't there before.
Taliesin: My friends are strong.
Matt: "With you here, Percival, we've two de Rolos spearheading the rebellion. We have the guiding light the people need."
Taliesin: Who else survived?
Matt: "We must succeed, Percival. If this fails, there won't be anyone else left to rise up. They are nearing their goal, according to your sister Cassandra. We haven't much time. Your sister lives, Percival."
Marisha: Oh shit!
Matt: "She survived the attack and was taken as the personal assistant and slave of the Briarwoods and used as an example, a symbol of their dominance. She has been feeding us information for years, whenever she could. She was the helping guide, the last two attempts we've made. We have not received a letter from her in weeks now, but know you are not the only surviving member of your family. I will talk to your people. I will talk to mine. We'll have your militia. Guide us, Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III. Guide us, Vox Machina."
Sam: Wait. You know who we are? How does he know?
Matt: "Some of us have information all over these lands. We've had a few friends come from Emon over the past couple years. They met some dire ends. Don't think that we haven't heard of your exploits. Help us bring a dawn back to this land."
Taliesin: I may have a plan. How fares Professor Anders?
Matt: "Professor Anders has been lost to us since before the insurrection. He is a man taken by what promises the Briarwoods have given him. What little he has shown his face in this town, he is not the man he once was, or at least the man we thought he was was never who he truly claimed to be."
Taliesin: He lives in the house in the east? House in the north?
Matt: "He lives in the castle with the Briarwoods, as well."
Taliesin: Lady Ripley lives in one of those mansions.
Matt: "She did. There have been reports in recent days that she's been quick to pack. We know not where she resides now."
Taliesin: Who lives in the third house?
Matt: "Here." And he takes a moment to think of which house you're referring to.
Taliesin: We burned one of them.
Matt: "Yes, you did. The house is Kerrion's house, and then there are two other homesteads of the new nobles, one of which is currently held by the Duke," he says with disdain. "Goran Vedmeyer."
Marisha: Goran Quagmire?
Laura: Vedmeyer.
Sam: Vedmeyer.
Matt: "Vedmeyer. He has supposedly been put in watch at the temple of Pelor, but he's left that to ruin. The other home houses Count Tylieri, a rather sadistic man who oversees the timber production of Whitestone."
Laura: The what production?
Matt: "Timber."
Sam: Is that the house that the Countess was briefly residing in?
Matt: "Briefly."
Sam: Count Tygieri?
Matt: "Tylieri."
Sam: Tylieri. How are these men, the duke and the count? What do the people think of them?
Matt: "The Briarwoods, when they took Whitestone, did not take it alone. They came to this land with a small army of cutthroats, mercenaries, sell-swords they brought over from whichever forsaken land they came from. Each one of those men that then proved to be of utmost use to them in that rebellion, they were given titles and nobility and homesteads. They were given responsibilities over the land, the people beneath them. I can only assume that was part of their payment for their service."
Sam: But they're just thugs who were particularly successful.
Matt: "As far as I know, yes."
Laura: Are they supernatural? Are they undead?
Matt: "Not to my knowledge."
Travis: If we were to continue working our way up this totem pole, which of the two is less powerful?
Taliesin: Which of the two is reviled most?
Marisha: Yes, what would start an uprising?
Matt: "Count Tylieri is known for being quite the sadistic individual. Beating, torturing his servants, sometimes publicly to show his hand to those who would cross him. He would definitely be a message to send, if there were one."
Taliesin: I have a plan.
Sam: I've got one, too. Kill him.
Taliesin: Well, that's part of the plan.
Matt: "I would warn, the longer we wait making these messages, the stronger we build this part of the city, but also the more warning and preparation time we give to those in the castle. So the choice is yours."
Liam: We act now.
Marisha: Act now?
Laura: Against the Briarwoods?
Travis: Count Tylieri.
Taliesin: Here's my plan.
Matt: The name Tylieri catches your ear's memory. If you recall, your captive back at Greyskull Keep was previously the owner of the driver of the Briarwoods, Desmond. The one that beat him senseless until eventually Lord Briarwood saw this and then took him as his own driver.
Sam: I'm just a small boy, but we've seen mists at night, strange things that come out when the sun goes down. Are those focused around a central area of town, or are those everywhere?
Matt: "The mists are a means of intimidation. It's merely a magical precursor to the undead minions of the Briarwoods. They slink through those mists, use them as cover. If you see it, run."
Sam: Thank you.
Laura: We heard about green fog here. Is that something?
Matt: "In the castle, yes. There are vents in what was once the garden. I know not the nature of these vents or what is being utilized to produce this foul, noxious odor, but it has put a scent on the city for many years."
Laura: Do we know what killed the tree?
Matt: "We know not."
Travis: And in your time, do you know anything about Lady Delilah? What she is?
Matt: "The few times she's walked the city, it's been procession and power. She seems to enjoy the attention. She's a vain one, that one."
Marisha: Who's this?
Laura: Lady Delilah.
Travis: Lady Delilah.
Laura: Does she come out during the day?
Matt: "She hasn't in almost a year, but she has before, yes. She walks in the sun, unlike her husband."
Sam: Unlike her husband?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: I don't think she's a vampire.
Marisha: She may not be a vampire.
Travis: I think she's a bitch.
Taliesin: What do you think of a distraction?
Laura: What kind of distraction?
Taliesin: What if there was a way to start a ruckus at the Vedmeyer estate? Start a fire, maybe. Start a ruckus of some kind.
Sam: The Vedmeyer estate?
Taliesin: The third house.
Sam: The duke's. Okay, yes?
Taliesin: They're going to be waiting and expecting us, so if they think we're attacking one of the houses and then instead we attack the other while everyone's rushing to deal with what they think is the next attack, we attack the second home, and then when they prepare for us to attack the third home, that's when we attack the castle.
Laura: I like it.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: Wait, you want to go bam-bam-bam?
Taliesin: Today, it's just one. We've already dropped one.
Laura: The next attack will be on the Briarwoods.
Sam: Well, he's saying create a distraction.
Liam: We make a big stink in the house we're not going into.
Marisha: That I'm cool with. Percy, how much do you want people to see the de Rolo family crest? How much do you want people to know of your presence here? Do you want a big proclamation? Because I might have that.
Taliesin: Will it put my sister in danger?
Matt: "It's hard to say."
Taliesin: They don't know that I know she's alive. Perhaps keep her, just to surprise me.
Sam: That symbol is not the de Rolo family seal, is it? It's modified.
Taliesin: It's a part of it. Definitely. I want them to know. They need to know.
Matt: "It's a tough decision. The symbol does carry the weight of the people and does carry a beacon of hope. But it, as you said, may put your sister in danger. It's hard to say. The choice is yours in how you wish to use it."
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Yes. Because I learned a trick back in the day from my father and the Air Ashari people. We used to do it as kids for fun, but it might be perfect in this circumstance.
Sam: I did it a little in college. It's fun.
Marisha: Dual-wielding. I can Skywrite for you.
Liam: How do you mean?
Laura: Like a giant sparkler.
Liam: Like a what?
Marisha: In the future, they came up with these awesome things called--
Sam: Nope!
Matt: Nope!
Travis: Nope!
Travis: Skywrite with clouds?
Marisha: Yeah, skywriting with clouds.
Liam: You control the clouds?
Travis: Can you actually write letters in them?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: That's crazy talk.
Laura: Can you clear out clouds? Then if you can do that, can you make these gray clouds go away?
Marisha: Do we want the gray clouds to go away?
Laura: Well, sunlight would be nice as opposed to this misty fog.
Travis: That's a good point.
Marisha: Maybe temporarily.
Matt: Yeah, controlling weather on that scope is a little beyond your grasp. You can alter elements of it and you could darken elements of the cloud to form a message or a symbol if you would like, but actually removing the clouds, that would be--
Laura: Can you poke a hole in them?
Marisha: Temporarily, yeah.
Travis: We'll remember that. Let's go pick a fight with a house!
Taliesin: From a distance. We pick a fight with a house from a distance so we can get to the other house and pick a fight there.
Laura: Is there just one of us who can make a big stink in the decoy house?
Sam: I can probably make a big stink.
Laura: You could definitely make a big stink.
Liam: But you can catch up through one of those little doorways.
Sam: Please, it's big for me.
Laura: How about this? I use one of my exploding arrows you gave me.
Sam: Oh, those are so cool. Save those for a person.
Travis: It's a good ranged stink.
Sam: I've got Magic Missiles. I've got all sorts of shit. I can do Stinking Clouds, I can make them see things, I can blow open their doors. I can do it. You guys go have fun.
Taliesin: But you can also do this from a distance so we can get you far away. You could do both.
Sam: I'll start on the distraction.
Taliesin: And I'm going to give you a second arrow as well.
Laura: Of what?
Taliesin: The arrow?
Matt: Okay.
Liam: It's a question-mark arrow.
Taliesin: It's an arrow?
Matt: Yeah. Write down arrow with a question mark. It looks heavily tinkered. It's a little front-loaded with the weight.
Taliesin: You know what it will do to the roof if it works?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay, cool.
Sam: It's a kill-Trinket arrow.
Laura: Oh man, you know what? I forgot I-- okay, cool.
Matt: (laughs) Yes. What?
Laura: Just don't. I have thoughts.
Matt: Cool, have thoughts. Keep them going.
Laura: Arrow?
Matt: Arrow?
Travis: All right, can we do something now, please?
Marisha: All right. Let's do it.
Sam: I'll head over to the other house. Show me on the map where it is so I know where I'm going.
Travis: What time is it?
Matt: By this point in the day, it's probably around three in the afternoon.
Taliesin: We're going to do this now.
Marisha: When do you want the symbol to go up?
Taliesin: Actually, we may not need it yet. That may actually work out well once we've--
Marisha: Lit the houses up?
Taliesin: Once it's up, can you actually write it in smoke coming off the house?
Marisha: Yeah, I think I could.
Matt: With a crack of thunder, rainfall begins to hit on the city.
Taliesin: Really?
Laura: Of course.
Marisha: Why is it raining again?
Laura: Because it's this fucking town. It's fucked. No offense. It won't be fucked soon.
Sam: Your town sucks, weather-wise.
Taliesin: So the northern house or the western house?
Matt: "The northern house is the one that Count Tylieri currently resides in. Or no. My apologies. The northern house is the one that Duke Goran Vedmeyer currently exists in. The other is Count Tylieri."
Taliesin: So this is the mess and this is our actual?
Sam: I'm the mess?
Taliesin: You're the mess.
Sam: All right. So you'll earphone me when you're in position? Let's go, quickly. We're burning daylight.
Taliesin: So probably from about here.
Marisha: I'm going with Scanlan.
Laura: No, come with us, Keyleth!
Sam: If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times. I don't need help.
Marisha: I wasn't trying to help you. I was trying to write the de Rolo symbol in smoke. I don't really care about you.
Taliesin: You can do it from the other house. It's sight-based.
Sam: They need your magic.
Liam: It's no knocks against you. He's going to catch up quickly.
Sam: And if I die, tell Pike I love her.
Laura: You won't die, Scanlan.
Sam: I might. I'm a little wee man.
Marisha: All right, I'm going with them.
Taliesin: You're a little boy. We're making very reasonable plans with this.
Matt: All right. Did you put your hat back on?
Taliesin: I have put my hat back on, yes.
Matt: Okay, yes, because you're very much visibly Percy.
Taliesin: Not anymore, I'm not!
Matt: All right. So you groups divide, Scanlan heading towards the northeastern house, the rest of you heading towards the northwestern house. Eventually, you get to the outskirts of both abodes, and you can see the dark clouds in the sky, occasional claps of thunder and flashes of light. Even though it's midday, it's pretty dark right now. The few folks that are out and about have their heads covered with hoods, and they're trying to stay under overhangs to stay nice and as dry as they can. You are all soaked to the bone at this point, just pushing through. Your cough is still setting in pretty heavily at this point, too. You guys make your way to the outskirts of the home. You, Scanlan, skipping along, the boy that you are with your one weird wandering eye, find your way to the other abode. So. What's the plan?
Sam: How far is the gate from the front door?
Matt: It's about 25, 30 feet. And the house that you're looking at right now, it's very well-crafted. Looks like it's made from a lot of the fine timber of Whitestone, the lighter woods and dark woods contrast with each other, stained to show the variation in the two. It's a very beautiful home.
Sam: Okay. Any guards? Anything around?
Matt: Currently, you can see there is one guard visible at the front. That's all you can see at the moment.
Sam: And if I walk around back, is there any guards around back?
Matt: There is a second guard around back that is just now stepping out of an outhouse that is situated behind the building.
Taliesin: That would excite you. I don't know why.
Sam: Sure. Because they haven't phoned me to tell me that we're ready to go, I will become a dragonfly and buzz into the dwelling.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Meanwhile, the twins are looking at our home, sizing it up.
Matt: All right. Keeping a close eye. Through the dark rainy atmosphere, you can see on both homes, the interiors are slightly lit. There appears to be individuals at home in both homes. You just can't see who it is, necessarily. There is light in the interior. As you turn into a fly and make your way, this little boy just walks and (zip). Go ahead and make a stealth check.
Sam: Ten.
Matt: Okay. You turn into a fly and make your way through the bars and begin (buzzing) over the yard with your one-twentieth of a hit point in fly form. Make your way. Any of the nearby windows all seem to be shut. The front door is closed. There might be a gap, but the guard is standing in front of the door.
Sam: Okay. Again, they haven't phoned me, so I'll perch on the handrail or door frame or something just above him and wait.
Matt: Okay. He takes notice of your buzzing as you go by and goes back to his watching. The rest of you guys?
Liam: We're sizing up the other home.
Laura: Yeah. Oh, how about this? Maybe we can tell Scanlan to set off the thingy. I'll come running out as my old crazy lady, saying, (screams) the house is under attack! Toward the guards guarding this house. And then I'll just stand there as they react.
Liam: I like it. Could we look at this house first?
Laura: I thought we did.
Taliesin: I thought you went to shoot the arrows in the other house.
Marisha: No, that's what Scanlan said.
Liam: What do I see? I'm looking all over this house.
Matt: Right. This house is also well-built, sturdy. Mostly wood construction, but it's all dark wood. It almost seems to disappear against the gray skies above it if you're looking from a downward perspective. It's a very dreary-looking home, built to look pretty for someone who doesn't like a lot of color. It's two stories; there are a number of windows on both stories. Looks like there is a small garden out front that has been long-ignored and died and dried up. Just browns. Abysmal-looking. Other than that, there's not much else to say on the building.
Liam: No guards, nobody watching?
Matt: Not currently any guards outside of it, no.
Liam: I want to go for a circle around.
Laura: Stealthy. Stealth. I cast Pass Without a Trace on him.
Matt: (laughs) And you stay within 30 feet of him?
Laura: Huh?
Matt: Can you stay within 30 feet of him?
Laura: I guess I stealth behind him.
Matt: All right. Both of you guys roll stealth.
Laura: Oh no. Which one should I use?
Liam: 28.
Laura: Add ten.
Liam: Good.
Laura: 36.
Sam: Jeez!
Liam: That's pretty good. What did you add? Oh, because of Pass Without a Trace! Oh, 38.
Matt: There you go, 36 and 38, boom.
Sam: You're both discovered and killed.
Matt: (laughs) Immediately. Just like that. You push into one of the nearby alleyways, curve around the side, and make your way to the back portion of this. And the gate is buttressed up against one of the surrounding buildings-- it's a warehouse of some kind-- to the point where there's a little bit of space you can get over, but it's about eight feet up and it is a spiky top, but looking over, you do see there is one guard that is slowly patrolling around the outside, and you see through the nearby window what looks like two humanoids that just crossed paths at the front of the window.
Liam: Two humanoids are in the house, there's a guard between the home, and the warehouse thing you just described?
Matt: Correct. Basically, you didn't see it from your perspective. Once you went around the alleyway to the other side of it, you do see there is one guard that is slowly patrolling the outside.
Laura: (whispers) I can perch and take him out with an arrow.
Liam: You do your thing, yeah. Yeah.
Laura: Do you want to sneak-attack him? That might be smarter.
Liam: I'll start, you follow.
Laura: Got it.
Liam: All right.
Laura: Should we let Scanlan do his thing first and then we sneak attack him? Set it all in motion?
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: All at the same time, then. On the count of three.
Marisha: What are we doing? Wait, what?
Sam: What? All I heard is on the count of three. What's going on?
Liam: Scanlan, whatever you're going to do, I want you to get ready to do it.
Laura: And then we'll count to three and we'll attack.
Sam: Shouldn't I do mine first?
Laura: Yeah, you do. Tell us when.
Sam: Oh, you want me to do mine first?
Travis: Whenever you're ready.
Sam: How about wait 30 seconds and go?
Laura: Got it.
Sam: All right. I turn into a triceratops. (laughter)
Liam: A what?
Matt: I'm going to say, roll an intelligence check.
Liam: Come on, Burt.
Sam: Intelligence?
Matt: With advantage, because you're a bard. Just add your intelligence modifier.
Liam: He gave you advantage. Roll again.
Sam: I already get advantage for intelligence checks. 19.
Matt: Okay. Through your bardic research and hearing many tales and seeing scribblings in books of presumably madmen, apparently, that there were certain creatures that existed long before the civilization had taken root. You have heard of some of these, one of which is the mighty and frightening triceratops. You hear it's just a fable, but it's fun to pretend to be one, sure.
Sam: Three horns and big.
Matt: Yep. And out of nowhere, this tiny fly (boosh) into a triceratops. (boom) Lands, crushing the man beneath you. He's going to attempt to-- oh, rolled a 20 on his saving throw. So he's only going to take half damage. Go ahead and roll 3d6 crushing damage.
Sam: d6? I don't even have a d6. (laughs) Wow. 17.
Matt: 17? Whoa, okay. He did not like that. Okay, he is crushed and he is prone beneath you right now, (groans).
Sam: And for my move, I bash down the door.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll an attack.
Sam: d20? 18.
Matt: Okay, yeah. Go ahead and roll another 3d6.
Sam: Three, six, that wasn't anything. Nine.
Matt: Nine plus three. 12 points of damage. You turn around, and with a loud cracking sound, the whole outside of the doorway and most of the outside of the room is thrashed and destroyed. Wood chunks go flying everywhere with a large roar. You see part of the inside of the foyer collapses from that side of the building. You basically take out a whole support and start thrashing around. You hear voices begin yelling out from in the household, and immediately five guards start rushing in from different rooms towards you. All right. Two of which are holding already armed and ready crossbows. We'll get to that in just a second.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: You guys?
Liam: I'm going to run up behind the one guard and beat him in the back of the head with the back of my dagger.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack. He does not see you; this is considered a surprise attack.
Liam: This is a surprise attack? Oh, that's good. Ooh, that's not that good. So that's 17.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: That hits, all right. And then the second attack, which'll also have advantage, is 23.
Matt: 23 also hits, yeah.
Liam: Okay, so sneak attack, yeah? So here we go. Plus, get them. (mutters) 25 for the first attack. Or no, 25 for the first attack--
Matt: Sneak attack?
Liam: That was it.
Matt: Right. It's a surprise round. Don't you get double damage for being an assassin?
Liam: Yeah, so 50. All I want to do is gunk him. Like I do.
Matt: And that's all you needed. He had 45 hit points. (whack) With one hit to the back of his head, he crumples onto the ground, smacking into the wet grass around this field.
Liam: And I look over my sister's shoulder and say, Grog! You want to play? Come on, you want to play?
Travis: Grog always wants to play!
Liam: Go for the door!
Travis: Fuck it. I rage.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: We're just going straight into the house?
Marisha: What are we doing? We're watching all this happen? We're all like, oh, there goes Grog.
Liam: Yeah, because you've said nothing.
Matt: You guys right now watch as now Vax runs over and tells Grog to run in and go after the front door.
Liam: Well, that's not what I said. I said, do you want to play?
Travis: No, I took off running.
Matt: Grog is running toward the door now. You guys see him bolt off, burst through the gate.
Travis: Activate the flaming warhammer.
Taliesin: I guess we're going.
Marisha: I guess we're going.
Liam: Everybody's running at the door.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll a strength check just for the hell of it. There is a closed gate. Athletics, this would be.
Travis: Oh. 14.
Matt: 14? Okay. It's not immediate impact. It takes you a second; you have to force your way through the gate. You essentially grab the two sides of it and pull and pull until eventually the chain snaps and the bars bend and you shove off one of the old doors. The gate (creaks, impact) onto the ground before you, leaving a straight look to the front door. You bolt for it. The rest of you guys give chase afterwards. You all rush to the front door of this homestead. It is currently closed.
Liam: We saw front door, we saw some sort of warehouse, and a side window with two people going, right?
Marisha: Let's flank.
Laura: Let's go in the window.
Liam: Let's go in the window.
Travis: I'll meet you in the middle!
Laura: Yeah, we go in the window.
Marisha: You said there was a door around back?
Matt: There's windows around back.
Liam: There's windows around back.
Marisha: I'll go around back.
Taliesin: I'll also go around back.
Laura: Oh, but that's only Grog in the front now.
Marisha: He's fine.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: I give him Trinket. Going in with you.
Travis: You want to send him in with me? It's going to be nasty where I'm going. It's all-day buffet.
Laura: He's going in the door.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Can we see any of the damage? Is there any smoke rising from the house yet?
Matt: No, there's no smoke. There's no smoke. There's nothing sending smoke at that point.
Liam: I'm trying to get a better look and listen as I run closer to the windows.
Matt: And we will pick up at this moment next week. (yelling)
Laura: Oh my gosh!
Sam: But I'm a dinosaur!
Matt: I know.
Marisha: I'm waiting for smoke.
Matt: I know, and we'll see how this plays out next week, because right now if we keep where this is going, this could be-- we could be here until late, and I need to get out of this costume.
Liam: Still a dinosaur. Open the door.
Sam: Scanlan on the floor. Everybody flee; there's a dinosaur.
Matt: (laughs) Triceratops. Damn it.
Travis: Damn it. (laughs)
Zac: So I have a couple requests from the community. One of which is that every single one of you post a full-body picture of your costume and post it to Twitter so they can get a good look without being blocked by the table. I think everyone just really wants to see his legs because he's not wearing pants under that dress.
Laura: But he is wearing a little petticoat.
Zac: And the other request was for you to explain how in the hell you made this, because this is amazing. They want a really quick run-down of what you did here.
Matt: Okay. Well, for the armor pieces, the base is Sintra, which is one-eighth of an inch thick PVC sheeting. You can buy it at sign supply stores.
Liam: (snores)
Matt: I know, Liam. Shut up, they asked me. So I cut those into sheets. You heat them up with a heat-gun or really hot hairdryer and you can bend it, so that was the shape for these. I ordered aluminum chainmail off eBay, straight from India, and cannibalized it to make the sheets of chainmail that I then epoxied onto the plastic. And this is a pleather that I stitched together and then adhered across it to make the trim, and that's how I made the armor.
Zac: Would you be willing to come on Mines N Crafts and do a little more detailed show-through of it? Because it's really cool, and there's details you guys can't see. Everyone was like, let him show off his swords, and I'm like, they're not real swords.
Matt: Nah, you can pull them out.
Zac: Yeah, you want to show them off?
Matt: Sure. I can't really grab them from here.
Zac: That's very ineffective for battle, Matt.
Matt: I know.
Liam: So less dexterous than the video game.
Marisha: You can't put claymores on your back, which is a big fallacy.
Matt: Yeah, unfortunately I don't have the lack of clipping that an actual warrior would have in this armor. Trust me, it's a sword.
Liam: Here's a little secret for people who love video games: when the heroes pull out a gun, put a gun away, pull out a sword, put a sword away, there's a guy on the performance capture set who just catches it and walks away. Hands it into your hand, so all this, they just go (pfft) and they don't put it anywhere. They just let go of it.
Zac: Actually, I posted that video today on twitter that one of the Critters posted and I retweeted it of Laura and Travis doing their motion-capture for Halo 5. Which guys, you should definitely check out Halo 5. Travis and Laura are both in the game.
Laura: We meant to announce that, yeah. It just released this week.
Zac: Yeah, it just released this week and Travis did some of the mocap for Fred and for Nathan Fillion's character, and in the video it shows you guys basically just throwing down--
Travis: Some magic item.
Zac: It's pretty cool.
Matt: So great. Yeah, and Minecraft released this week.
Sam: Story Mode!
Matt: Story Mode, yeah.
Zac: Yeah, we showed a little bit of that. It was like, oop, that's Matt.
Matt: Yeah, sorry.
Taliesin: Is there anybody else in Story Mode of Minecraft that we should mention?
Matt: That are friends of ours? I mean, Cat Taber's in it--
Laura: Ashley fricking Johnson!
Matt: I know. I thought I mentioned it previously, but yeah.
Zac: Just assume if a game's coming out, one of these guys--
Matt: You can't escape us.
Zac: You can't escape. It gets really weird now every time we turn on a game and we're like, and who is this this week?
Taliesin: Now you know our pain.
Matt: Sorry about that, guys.
Marisha: Ruins every game.
Travis: Sorry not sorry.
Laura: Sorry not sorry.
Taliesin: We heard your voice at Target.
Matt: What?
Taliesin: We were walking through Target and were like, "Hey, guys."
Matt: Oh right, yeah, the Playmation toys.
Taliesin: You started talking at us--
Matt: You guys have seen the cool Marvel Playmation toys for kids, the imaginary stuff. I do Iron Man and Loki and a few other guys.
Marisha: It's the toy that all your kids are going to bitch and scream and want, and you're going to be like really, it's the most expensive toy? It's like $150. It's like the toy of the year, man. It's cool.
Matt: Yeah. I'm going to go play with mine. Yeah, anyway.
Zac: Well, we had some donations today for Extra Life. This was our last week for Extra Life donations, guys. As a whole, okay, we'll get through these and then I'll read the total overall, because it's something everyone in our community should be proud of.
Matt: Okay.
Zac: So, list starts right here. [end of transcription]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Hate you, Liam. (laughter)
Travis: That was good! Really nice. Some good flavor on it.
Matt: You'll never know. So anyway! Welcome new folks. People who aren't new folks, welcome back. We have some announcements to get to real fast, then we'll jump into the actual story proper here. But, yeah! So, first and foremost, I wanted to give a big thanks and shout-out to Syrinscape, I mentioned them in last week's game, I put together my gaming playlists on their platform, and I'm going to be trying them out tonight to make sure everything works out cool, but their setup is fantastic and I'm really excited about being able to overlap audio, and things fade in and out. If you haven't checked it out, and you want to really amp up your tabletop gaming, it's phenomenal. But they're not paying for this, I'm really excited about it. So that's that, Syrinscape's awesome. Marisha, you want to talk about Signal Boost?
Marisha: Yeah! The first epil-- episode.
Laura: Epilsode!
Marisha: The first epil, of--
Taliesin: Epilay!
Marisha: Epil, epilay, epilogue. The first episode of Signal Boost went live on Tuesday. Go check it out on GeekandSundry.com. Go watch it, it's good fun. And you should go watch it so we don't get cancelled, and we'll keep making more episodes.
Liam: Is that how it works?
Marisha: Apparently!
Matt: Yeah, it's the weirdest thing.
Marisha: It's crazy.
Laura: They care about that?
Marisha: Yeah. And I talk about Rat Queens, in it, and--
Laura: Yes! I saw! It's so good, Marisha. It's really funny.
Taliesin: It's like ten minutes of your-- you have more minutes than two minutes, spend a couple of minutes.
Marisha: And I tell you about cool things that I like. That I picked out myself. My favorite things. Done.
Matt: Watch it. It's good. All right. Next thing I wanted to announce for you guys, tonight's donations, and all donations for the week, are going to be going, as opposed to 826 overall, are going to go to 826Seattle specifically, to Fearless Ideas, is what it's called there, their section up there, you can go to FearlessIdeas.org. This past week there was a terrible gas explosion in Seattle, you may have seen on the news, and it did a lot of damage to that vicinity, including Fearless Ideas, and they've had to cancel a bunch of their stuff, and they're trying to get things repaired and going. So all of our donations this evening will be going towards them and helping them get that effort taken care of. So think good thoughts and help out if you can. Let's see.
Travis: Love you, Seattle!
Marisha: Love you, Seattle!
Matt: 826. We've, next Friday, in Anaheim, at WonderCon, Friday night, we'll be doing a Critical Role panel, from 7:00 to 8:00pm, in Room 515A.
Laura: Wait, are we supposed to be at that?
Matt: Next Friday. Next Friday. But most of us will be there for that panel. We'll be doing a Q&A, answering questions, talking about the show, for all the folks that are local or coming to that convention in the Anaheim area of southern California. So, look forward to seeing you there, next Friday.
Laura: Yes, that's when we-- I can't say. I'll talk to you guys afterwards.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. We'll go over that. Mystery-- secret, I like it.
Laura: Secret, secret.
Matt: Wanted to give another shout-out to Dwarven Forge again, I mentioned them last week. You got to get a glimpse of some of the map stuff they gave us here at Critical Role to help improve our battle mats and scenarios on occasion. Their new Castle Builder Kickstarter is phenomenal, and if you're looking to do big structures and cool castle-based ramparts and parapets and everything, go check it out, it might be right up your alley.
Travis: So pretty.
Matt: So pretty. It's so pretty. Also, Laura, if you want to announce, we have some new merch up in the store!
Laura: Go check GeekandSundry.com, go to their store, right now, because they're up, and it's so awesome, and I can't wait for you guys to see, we have a Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirt. (cheering)
Laura: And I've been so excited about this shirt coming out, I can't wait to wear it, why aren't we wearing it right now?
Matt: (Gilmore voice) "Don't worry. Trust me, it's a fabulous shirt. Some would even say it's quite glorious."
Travis: Oh my god, oh my god.
Laura: As well as the Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirts, we also have exclusive Critical Role d20 rings, spinny rings. Those are limited, so if you get them, then snag them fast, because they're going to be gone.
Travis: We get one of those before they disappear, right?
Laura: I think they said they were going to set us aside some, they'd better.
Travis: They are. They're bitchin'. You spin it, the 20 is the Critical Role logo.
Laura: Why don't we have them right now?! At intermission, maybe we can grab them at intermission.
Travis: They're sick.
Matt: For those who don't know what those are, the d20 spin rings, or spin rings in general, they're actually two separate moving pieces with ball bearings on the inside, and you have all numbers one through 20 on the actual ring, and you can spin it with your finger, and it acts like a die roll!
Laura: And the d20, when you crit succeed, it's a Critical Role logo. Just putting that out there.
Travis: You can do all your life decisions based off a ring.
Matt: What could possibly go wrong?
Liam: You still can die from them, though, just to be clear.
Taliesin: Roll a one.
Marisha: And we are not held responsible if that happens.
Travis: You go straight to Craven Edge.
Liam: It's appropriately called a "die."
Laura: Whatever.
Matt: Liam!
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: You wanted to--
Liam: Sure, I could talk about a couple of things. Hey, a quick shout-out for our neighbor, Ivan van Norman's Kickstarter, The ABCs of RPGs, has three days left. I backed it immediately, because I like D&D and I have kids, and you put those two things together and good things happen. So that's good, three days left. Also, hey, if you like to put your dice in boxes, I tell you what. Wyrmwood Gaming make beautiful boxes, and if you go over to their site and you use the code critrole.
All: Crit. Role.
Liam: There it is. You get free shipping, they're beautiful, they have all different kinds of woods to put your dice inside. Is there anything else? Oh, yeah! Oh, okay. Yeah, hey, some of us, not all of us, are going to be going up to San Fran later this month to make appearances on GameSpot's show The Lobby for a couple of segments, and then, also then hopping over to hang with the guys at Kinda Funny to play D&D.
Laura: Those guys are stupid.
Matt: Which, a few of us will be running a quick little one-shot game I'll be running with the aid of one of their local gentlemen. And it should be a ridiculously ridiculous time! And it'll be a lot of fun.
Liam: And I'm curious to see, because there's going to be two DMs, in sort of a Batman and Robin-type relationship kind of thing?
Matt: Oh yeah. We got plans. I've co-DM'd before, it can be very interesting. And very chaotic. I'm excited.
Travis: Going to kill everybody.
Matt: Probably.
Laura: This has nothing to do with announcements, but I want to only roll green dice tonight. For Saint Patrick's Day.
Marisha: That's a good idea, I've got a set of green dice. I'll get them out. Sure.
Travis: That's stupid. I have gray-ass dice and a blue one.
Marisha: Got to get them all out.
Matt: This is technically light green, guys, by the way, just so you're aware. Cool. Just making sure we're all cool on that.
Travis: Plus the underwear you're wearing.
Matt: Shh, that's just for you.
Liam: Travis and I are wearing green snake shirts, because (Irish accent) Saint Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland, into Burbank.
Matt: Drove the Slytherin from Ireland. He got rid of them all.
Travis: Yeah. I took the Floo network.
Marisha: And I got this in Ireland, so it counts.
Laura: It kind of counts, Marisha.
Marisha: It counts.
Liam: (Irish accent) It's fucking Irish wool!
Marisha: And this is green.
Travis: Yeah, made from real Irish cats.
Matt: They are the best, aren't they? Last but not least, unless anyone else has any other announcements to make, anything else?
Taliesin: Oh! I got a quick one, Book of Murder came out today, so you can hear me do a very weird accent, it's great. So. Yes. Very weird accent.
Matt: And last, next week, we'll have a special guest joining us for an episode, a new guest, the intrepid Nerdist himself, Chris Hardwick, will be coming in for a game next week. (cheering)
Matt: Oh, I'm excited! We made his character this past Monday, and it should be a lot of fun. He's actually fun to game with. We've played D&D a couple times, and he'll be a good addition to the team for his brief stop by. So next week, come check him out on our show!
Travis: Uh-oh, what does that mean?
Matt: So thanks for coming, Chris. I don't know, it'll be fun.
Taliesin: Cleric, is what it means.
Matt: Hoping every guest is a cleric. Just in case.
Travis: Save us! From ourselves.
Matt: All right, then. Without further ado, unless you guys have anything else, we'll go ahead and hop into a quick synopsis of where we are in Critical Role.
Liam: Shit. Help. Help. Help. Help.
Matt: Sam will be here shortly, guys, don't freak out. He's dealing with children and traffic.
Taliesin: Not at the same time.
Marisha: Damn it, you beat me to it. I was going to say those two aren't mutually exclusive. Children and traffic.
Matt: So. Where we left off. The party of Vox Machina, having to deal with the current terrible danger of the Chroma Conclave, a collection of very dangerous dragons that have torn through the entire Tal'Dorei countryside, have then gone on this quest to collect allies, and find these items called the Vestiges of Divergence, these artifacts of ancient wars that carry great power and seem to be the best way you could prepare yourselves for going up against these terrifyingly powerful entities. In searching for this, you went and made your way to Vasselheim, where you reacquired and reestablished friendships with Zahra and Kashaw, two allies from previous instalments of our wondrous adventure, as well as getting Lady Kima on loan from the Platinum Sanctuary of Bahamut, and you all went to seek the first bit of information you discovered about one of these vestiges, not too far from Vasselheim. The champion of the Raven Queen's armor that had been entombed within this temple that had sunken beneath a lake. After traveling to this lake, finding your way through this subterranean, watery location, you found the location of the tomb, upon which, a series of fish creatures, called kuo-toa, had seemingly been worshiping another denizen of this temple, a rather strange slime-covered beholder, that then surprised the party. The battle hard-fought, you came out victorious, and upon going to retrieve your spoils, a trap was set off in the tomb, dodged by one, survived by a bear, and claimed the life of our beloved Vex'ahlia. After a resurrection ritual attempted by Kashaw, the party helping, they were successful in bringing her soul back from the other side, restoring her to life, and the party then, figuring out what their next step in their journey was, took their new allies, via Keyleth's Teleportation via Plants spell, back to Whitestone, which seems to be building as this defensive bastion, this currently not on the radar of the Conclave location that needs defenses, and a good place to keep your allies at the time. And that was where we left off, as you guys had just stepped back into Whitestone.
Laura: We haven't actually slept yet, then.
Matt: Nope!
Laura: It's late.
Marisha: What time is it here?
Matt: I'd say through the evening's travels-- Well, you guys slept all night the night before you went to the temple, the temple's probably been--
Marisha: That's true, we did sleep, actually, we camped out.
Laura: We did?
Marisha: Remember? You talked to Zahra, and I talked to Kash? Then we slept.
Matt: Yeah, you guys did camp out.
Laura: Oh. I didn't know if we camped, I thought we talked.
Matt: You talked.
Marisha: We at least chilled. I don't know.
Matt: Regardless. You found your way to Whitestone. We'll say for the sake of the current setting, you've come in in a rather overcast mid-afternoon in Whitestone, you may have spent some time there gathering yourselves as your allies scope out their new surroundings, the people of Whitestone accepting you as you arrive, you can always see people walking by and catching a glance at the group of heroes known as Vox Machina that helped liberate them from the oppressive Briarwoods not long ago.
Taliesin: Keep crawling out of trees.
Marisha: It's always weird. Not crawling out of trees, that people like us.
Travis: Should we inspect our spoils?
Taliesin: I was going to say, we should take the armor and the necklace to the castle and have it inspected.
Laura: Is Lady Allura here?
Matt: Kima, who is with you, is like, "Is she?"
Laura: No. Well, she was on her way to Westruun, and we haven't heard from her yet.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: "Haven't heard from her since-- You say Westruun was under attack as well?"
Laura: Yes, but she knew it. She was going in secret.
Matt: "That prideful woman." She slings her hammer off her shoulder and slams it to the ground and says, "Well. If she doesn't arrive in the next few hours, I'm going to gather a party and we're going to go to Westruun and find her."
Travis: Yeah!
Marisha: Kima-- Wait, what? Why?
Laura: Wait, there's a dragon there, Kima, a very large one, and she was being very, very stealthy--
Matt: Her hammer slams into her metallic armor, and she goes, "I've a much bigger dragon backing me up." And she looks up to the sky for a second and grins.
Travis: Lady Kima don't give a fuck.
Laura: We'll wait, Kima.
Matt: (frustrated sigh)
Laura: Going in loud will only cause more trouble.
Matt: "I'll wait a few days."
Laura: She should be here by then.
Marisha: I can always attempt to scry, and see if I can check in on her.
Matt: "Okay. Not a bad idea."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "Okay. I need a drink."
Marisha: Let's get somewhere safe.
Matt: She charges off, looking for the nearest tavern.
Marisha: Here, I guess. I don't know. I forget it's not overrun by vampires, I'm sorry. Sorry, I forgot; it's all right now.
Laura: Maybe somewhere safe, like right here--
Marisha: Like right here, sorry, there's a lot going on.
Matt: Zahra and Kashaw looking around expectantly as you continue this conversation. Kash crosses his arms, goes, "Great place. There's a lot of white." Of which Zahra comes and steps over and is like, "Don't worry, darling. (laughter) So, sleeping arrangements, I hope?"
Laura: Yes, the castle.
Taliesin: We'll be putting you up in the castle.
Matt: "That's what I like to hear. All right. To the castle, Kash?" "Sure. It's better than, well, it's better than anything. Let's go for the castle." And they both make their way towards Whitestone Castle, to find a comfortable place to get themselves situated in their new surroundings.
Laura: So we're healed up, we are healed, we are not running the risk of dying at any moment, because we've been healed.
Matt: What is that? What is that blur of green?
Travis: It's a fucking leprechaun, get it!
Sam: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Liam: You should be.
Marisha: Your shirt, is that new? Because I love it so much.
Sam: Thanks! But I'm also wearing a tie because it's a special night.
Laura: Right. It's a special occasion.
Sam: (sighs) So, is Allura dead? (laughter)
Travis: Kima just left, so--
Laura: She's on her way to a tavern. Kima's drinking it up. Grog! Kima's drinking it up.
Marisha: Are we heading to a tavern?
Taliesin: We're heading to the castle. We're going to talk to friends, we're going to take a look at--
Travis: Corpse armor, hello.
Marisha: Oh, corpse armor.
Travis: Yeah. You know, the thing that almost killed our friend over here?
Laura: It did kill me. According to you.
Taliesin: It-- yes.
Travis: Yeah, but, I mean, you're here, so you didn't die. But you did. But you didn't. But you did. And then you didn't.
Laura: Thanks, Grog.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: All right, so. You guys all heading to the castle?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: You head to the castle. Cassandra isn't there at the moment, but Keeper Yennen is currently there with a few other members of the makeshift council you guys put together towards the end. One of the heads of the entire farming establishment here in Whitestone is with them, and they're having a conversation. As Zahra and Kashaw burst in first, he's like, "I'm sorry, we're not currently taking visitors, could you-- Oh. Friends of yours, I presume?"
Taliesin: Good friends.
Laura: Helpers, actually. They're going to be here for a while. Hopefully.
Matt: "Gracious. Oh, I see you yourself carry the vestments of a man of the cloth. Who brings your power this day?" Kashaw gives him a look and goes, "You don't even want to know, buddy." Walks past him.
Taliesin: That was a really good Kashaw.
Matt: "Very well! I assume they're staying here as well."
Taliesin: Yes. We appreciate it greatly.
Matt: "They'll be taken care of, Percival."
Taliesin: They will be well worth your time. We also have something that needs a bit of study. We found something. We found two objects of power that we think may help us turn the table against the dragons.
Laura: Two objects?
Matt: "This is good news."
Taliesin: Two objects.
Laura: What was the second?
Taliesin: There was a necklace.
Laura: There was?
Taliesin: There was.
Sam: You were dead.
Laura: Oh. I must have missed it because I was dead. That's right.
Matt: "Dead?!"
Taliesin: It's been a very long day.
Sam: Mostly dead.
Marisha: Be very careful when handling this armor, is what we're trying to say.
Travis: Or don't handle it, and we'll take care of it.
Matt: "So, the armor is what killed you?"
Laura: No, actually, a trap that Percival set off is what killed me.
Taliesin: Yes, the--
Liam: What?
Taliesin: -- trap was a bit-- it was a bit, ah-- there was a trap. And it was well-protected.
Liam: What?
Laura: What, what, what? What?
Taliesin: Yes, what.
Laura: What?
Travis: (mutters) He didn't know that.
Laura: What? So these Vestiges.
Matt: "Vestiges."
Laura: These leathers, these things.
Matt: "Um--" And he puts a couple of small, armored, like, studded-leather gloves on and has to carefully reach out for the vestments as you hand them. And he grabs them. "Give me a bit of time with them, perhaps, I need to clarify what this enchantment may be. Do you mind staying around, just in case?"
Taliesin: Not at all.
Matt: "Don't feel strange that I don't trust this, but, based on your history with it, I would like a little backup." So, he carries you off down the far hallway, you didn't get this far into Whitestone when you initially came through, but towards the back there was a small study area converted into a research establishment largely set up for the ziggurat beneath the city. He clears off an area of the table and sets this down. And he takes some time working with the vestments before he eventually, and it's this awkward quiet of hearing him mutter to himself and bring out a symbol and bring over a minor enchantment to reveal information, that tearing into the divinity, the divine magic that is granted to him, before he says, "This carries the mark of the Raven Queen, a very strong mark. I've not seen power like this in but an object."
Laura: It was worn by one of her champions. The great Purvan.
Matt: "That's a strange name."
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "Regardless, it appears that this armor does help fortify one's defenses from any sort of physical damage, as well as give you a chance of surviving even the most dangerous of near-death experiences. It also grants a fluid resistance to the elements. Here." And he hands it over, and-- who would like to take this? Item card to--
Travis: Well, you died for it, you--
Laura: I think I like it, but I'll just look at it.
Marisha: It's leather?
Laura: It's leather.
Matt: So, to give you the specifics on it, it's plus two to AC. Magical on top of the studded leather armor. Plus two enchantment, beyond just the studded leather armor. It does give you advantage on death saving throws.
Sam: You'll need that.
Matt: As it is called the Deathwalker's Ward, and once per short rest, you can set it to be resistant to one of the five types of damage.
Laura: You choose which one.
Matt: You choose. You can change it. You can leave it all on one, but if you want to change it during a short rest, you can shift it from fire or cold, or lightning--
Travis: Acid, or necrotic.
Sam: You're, like, indestructible now!
Marisha: Do you have fancy leather armor right now? What does your armor do right now? Anything?
Liam: It's acid-resistant.
Laura: My armor's acid-resistant, I sort of stole it from my brother. Do you want your acid-resistant armor back, then?
Liam: Whatever you want, Vex'ahlia.
Laura: He's in such a sour mood lately.
Travis: Well, yeah. Well, what about the necklace?
Matt: "The necklace as well?"
Taliesin: I hand it over.
Matt: He takes it, and he goes, "Well, the chain on this necklace is not actually part of the enchantment, it's merely to hold the crystal itself. The crystal is the item of particular interest here, this-- oh, wait a minute." He takes it and he scans over the table and pulls up a jeweler's eyepiece and inspects it closely. "There's something inside this gem."
Travis: Uh-oh.
Marisha: (groans) Not again.
Laura: What is it?
Marisha: Why do things like living in gems? It can't be comfortable.
Travis: It might be a worm.
Laura: It's like tequila.
Matt: "I can't actually ascertain the nature of whatever being is encased within this, but--"
Laura: There's a being, it's a being?
Marisha: Encased.
Laura: Is it a soul gem?
Marisha: Like something put it in there.
Matt: He takes a moment and concentrates on his holy symbol of Pelor, and you can see as he puts aside the eyepiece, his eyes glaze over with a grayish, frosted white color, at which point he inspects the gem very closely, and there's this slight vibration in the air around him. As soon as it fades about a minute later, he pulls back and goes, "This is referred to as the Raven's Slumber. It's actually a small gateway to a tiny pocket-plane."
Sam: A pocket-plane?
Marisha: Ooh.
Matt: "It can contain one creature. You have to contact whatever it was, and it can't be too big, but it can essentially contain something indefinitely within this."
Laura: But something's already in there?
Matt: "Something is already in this."
Travis: Awesome.
Sam: Something that we can summon?
Marisha: Any way we can find out what it possibly is before we summon it?
Matt: "Unfortunately, I do not have that capability."
Laura: It was buried with--
Sam: I'll take that.
Laura: Oh, that's really smart to give to Scanlan.
Travis: Well, like, you said "not too big" though, right?
Matt: "The confines of the space, at least, as part of the enchantment, seem rather small. A bit larger than you, maybe, but not much more than that."
Travis: Right, right, okay.
Matt: "Here."
Travis: Please.
Marisha: Well, does it change size?
Laura: This is maybe the worst thing that Scanlan's ever held outside of that gun that you had, Percy.
Travis: What are you talking about? Can we take it in the woods, open it up, and if it sucks we kill it, and if not, we've got a new pet.
Marisha: We don't even know how to open it up! Do we know how to open it up?
Travis: Oh, we will find a way.
Laura: It was buried with the Raven Queen's champion, I mean, it could be incredibly dangerous. Or it could be incredibly good, and he trapped it, and they're bad, right?
Liam: The same could be said about your new pajamas.
Laura: They are so beautiful. I do like feathers.
Travis: What do they smell like?
Laura: (sniffs) Like (sniffs) must and mold. And birds, really.
Travis: (laughing) And birds? Eesh.
Matt: "So, is that all you require of me?"
Travis: I require Percy to tell us what the fuck's up with the necklace he's reading about.
Taliesin: Just what he said.
Laura: Yeah, he already told us about it.
Sam: Once we release whatever is inside of it, we can use this necklace as a weapon, to--
Taliesin: It's a cage.
Sam: To trap people.
Marisha: Hang on, okay. Let's think about this. What do we remember from the great Purvan's story?
Laura: Well, let me look at my book?
Marisha: What did he fight?
Sam: I just remember that Purvan's story touched me. Touched me in inappropriate ways.
Travis: (laughing) No, no, no.
Laura: You know what I like about this particular piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so it's extra special instead of the regular paper.
Matt: It's legendary.
Taliesin: Legendary cardstock.
Marisha: Can we get purple cardstock up in here?
Laura: I'm talking to Matt, bitches. Okay. I forgot what I was going to say-- Oh, my book! My 30-gold book! Does it say anything about what Purvan fought?
Matt: All right! You read through. There were many, many things throughout the war that were fought: entities from the Nine Hells, there was a faction of the Abyss that came in as a third bit of evil in this whole conflict; and while not in alliance against the other forces of chaos, there were many forces of chaos lashing out at what was nearby. So the Champion's-- there was no specific entity that was his chosen, or at least, what you can ascertain to be a specific being of hatred, although it does speak of Purvan, the Champion of the Raven Queen, keeping with him an ally.
Laura: Like Trinket.
Matt: It doesn't say the nature of the ally, it just says the dangerous and respected Galdric.
Laura: (gasps) Galdric.
Taliesin: Well, there are some options here.
Laura: What?
Taliesin: No, that won't work, damn it.
Travis: Well, say it, come on.
Taliesin: Well, I was thinking we could find a safe place, surround it, let it out, and if it's dangerous, take care of it. We could even take it down into the pits beneath the castle so that if it's a magical creature, it would be harmless. Except I don't know if we could actually release it down there. I don't know--
Laura: Yeah, what if it touches the thing, and it--
Sam: There's also magic resistance down there.
Taliesin: Yeah, which means it wouldn't work in the first place.
Marisha: What if he's friendly? I mean, he talks about being an ally.
Taliesin: It might be an ally.
Marisha: Well then, wouldn't we want to save it?
Laura: An ally of Purvan! An ally of Purvan's!
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Is Purvan a good guy?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: I thought the Raven Queen was not good!
Taliesin: No, the Raven Queen--
Marisha: She's like-- neutral.
Taliesin: Can I make a roll for this?
Matt: Make a religion check.
Taliesin: Okay, thank you. Nope, nope, it's St. Patty's Day.
Travis: Don't kill anybody.
Laura: Yeah, with these green dice.
Taliesin: Religion or history?
Matt: Religion.
Travis: Religion.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: 11. The general essence of the Raven Queen she is both loved and feared in equal parts. She does not lord over the afterlife, the underworld, whatever you may call it-- she lords over the moment and the transition of death, which is largely considered neither a good nor evil, just a natural force. It could be accepted either way. Many men fear it, and fear her for that reason, and there are those that instead embrace it as the inevitable. As to the true nature of her intent, no one really knows. It's part of her mystique.
Travis: So, like, even if we let out the glorious Ball-lick or whatever his name is, like, if he's bad, we can't really put him back in, right?
Taliesin: No, we actually can. Actually, we can put him back in.
Travis: What, we touch him with it and he goes back in?
Sam: Correct.
Matt: After a saving throw.
Marisha: Maybe we should save him and release him when he'll be valuable to us?
Taliesin: So would a trap. We could also trap other creatures--
Laura: It's like a Poké Ball! Right? It's like a Pokémon?
Taliesin: Yes, it's exactly like a Poké Ball.
Marisha: Who knows if he'll go back in willingly?
Taliesin: You don't have to go in willingly, that's sort of the point.
Matt: I guess you could technically use it that way, yeah.
Marisha: But wouldn't we rather be friendly with him than him be angry at us the next time we release him?
Taliesin: I'm more excited about the idea of carrying around an empty trap.
Marisha: But we could win both. But we could have a trap and a friend.
Liam: I think Percy is right that we should let it out now because it's a question mark, no matter what. Whatever, it's all theories. We don't know what we're getting into, and better that it pop out now, on its own, and not while we're facing a fucking beholder.
Laura: I think we should do it in the forest outside of Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Or the forest outside of Whitestone.
Sam: Vasselheim? We're here.
Marisha: Why don't we try and do a little bit more research on Galdric first?
Sam: That would be too careful.
Travis: Yeah, come on. Come on.
Sam: Vex! Just open it!
Liam: Percival. Are there any libraries here?
Taliesin: Not really, anymore.
Liam: What about a personal collection in your family?
Taliesin: Didn't they ravage most of our collection?
Matt: Elements have been ravaged. Elements of family history have been destroyed so that there couldn't be large connections, or the end of the bloodline itself being too prominently displayed within the castle itself. There is still a library there, though from your knowledge-- and you've read through most of those books growing up-- a lot of them are loose history books; a lot of them are more encyclopedia-like, general knowledge--
Taliesin: She wasn't a revered deity in this part of the world, we don't have a lot--
Laura: All right, yeah, let's do it. Woods!
Travis: Woods! Woods! Woods!
Taliesin: Woods, or Vasselheim, that's actually not a bad idea to get far away from Whitestone.
Travis: No, because then somebody else'll come along and kill it.
Sam: Plus they don't like magic.
Taliesin: This is sort of our secret, and we should perhaps keep this--
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Well, we were going to go take a look at--
Marisha: (muffled) What if--
Travis: You got shit in your mouth.
Marisha: We g-- mm, sorry. Little bit of saliva.
Liam: Goodberries?
Marisha: Snacks. We go to those goliath caves, right outside of Whitestone, that were abandoned.
Travis: Stone giant caves?
Marisha: Those!
Travis: Shit. Made me feel like I had to poop for a second, there. Goliath caves, fuck.
Marisha: Sorry! I just remembered you recognized them. They were empty, and abandoned, we could go there.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Is that close to your family?
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: No, we saw it on the way into Whitestone.
Taliesin: It's just a couple hours away, correct?
Laura: Oh.
Matt: It's, I'd say roughly three, three and a half hours northwest of here.
Laura: Let's do it!
Matt: Yeah, it's where the forest of the Alabaster Sierras ends and the actual Alabaster Sierra mountain range begins, is where that transitions.
Taliesin: We can take a day and do this.
Laura: All right, sure. Let's do it. All right. What do you think? Good idea? Good idea?
Liam: Sure, yes, yes, yes, Keyleth had a good idea, yes.
Matt: All right. So.
Laura: We're healed, yes?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: We're healed, right? Did we sleep? Do we need to sleep?
Liam: I thought we rested before we went down under the water, though--
Laura: No, we did, we didn't rest since then.
Liam: I don't remember resting afterwards. And I was there.
Travis: I don't either. I remember I peed on a lake, and then we went under it.
Matt: Yeah, I think you guys decided instead of resting to come to rest here in Whitestone.
Laura: Yeah, we need to sleep, y'all!
Taliesin: Let's take a sleep, and we'll do it in the morning.
Travis: What time is it, about?
Matt: I'd say by now, with as much time as you spent in the temple, from waking up in the morning, it's getting four in the afternoon, five in the afternoon. The sun's starting to come down, so.
Laura: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.
Sam: Aren't we going to sleep?
Laura: But it's four in the afternoon! There's other things to do today.
Marisha: Like drink?
Laura: Like find out how Gilmore's doing and see Pike.
Marisha: And I should probably scry and check in on Allura, right?
Taliesin: I've got some work to do.
Matt: It's up to you guys. Yeah, and you're starting to push towards the bottom of your ammunition stack anyway, Percy.
Taliesin: I need to, yeah, to do a little-- and I've got a little thing I want to work on.
Matt: Cool. All right, so, who's doing what first?
Taliesin: I'm going to take Vax aside very quickly.
Travis: Let's do that first!
Taliesin: I had a careless moment, and I apologize. And you're the first apology I'm putting forward. I don't know if I would have done anything different, but I hope you know that I would've never forgiven myself.
Liam: What're you talking about?
Taliesin: I rushed in and triggered the trap that almost killed your sister.
Liam: That killed my sister.
Taliesin: I can't say that.
Liam: What do you mean?
Taliesin: I was careless.
Liam: Well, what happened, Percival?
Taliesin: I felt the danger had passed, and I moved too quickly, and opened the casket without thinking. That's all. I just didn't think.
Liam: You just opened it? Just like that?
Taliesin: I was tired, wasn't thinking. Sometimes we move too quickly. But I want you to know that it would've-- I'm very glad that she's alive, because I don't think I could have lived with myself.
Liam: All right. Could you do me a favor?
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: In the future-- If there is anything that your little heart desires inside of a box-- In the future, could you check with my sister or myself first?
Taliesin: That's the hope, yes. That was more of a lesson than I was hoping for. Thankfully not too much of one.
Liam: Well--
Taliesin: And none of us are beyond mistakes, but... that is a mistake that I am going to be thinking about for a very long time. We are going into dangerous territory, and we all have to think a little bit more. And she especially, I-- I couldn't--
Liam: Well listen, Percy. We are not playing a game.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: And we will all make mistakes, and I wager I will make my fair share. I've little doubt. And Percival, I want to apologize. I'm sorry. But-- And I punch him in his know-it-all fucking mouth.
Matt: Do you attempt to move out of the way, or take it?
Taliesin: Yeah, let's take it.
Matt: All right. (impact sound) Decks you square in the-- for as hefty as a punch it was? Doesn't hurt quite as much as you expected. But it's not the physical pain that hurts, more than the action and the knowledge that there are more repercussions to your rash decision than even you initially anticipated.
Liam: Goodnight, Percival.
Taliesin: Goodnight, Vax.
Sam: It's four in the afternoon! (laughter)
Taliesin: I'm going to work. I'm going into my studio.
Matt: All right, who else wants to do something?
Marisha: Where'd Kima go?
Matt: Kima is actually-- she's begun day-drinking into the night! So yeah, she's currently by herself in one of the few functional taverns in Whitestone. It's fairly empty at the moment, especially at this hour as the sun slowly sets. She's not heavy drinking but she's definitely nursing a tankard and quietly contemplating as she sits at the edge of the bar with her hands around the tankard. She's staring at her reflection as she spins it slowly on the wood. You can hear it (scuffing) on the woodgrain.
Marisha: Anyone else want to go to the--
Laura: I'm going with you, yeah.
Matt: There's like a few other random patrons, but no one catches your eye. No one specifically.
Sam: I'll come, too. Well, actually, wait. Grog, what're you doing?
Travis: Nothing yet.
Sam: I'm with Grog.
Matt: Okay. So the two of you, into the tavern-- she doesn't notice you guys.
Marisha: I go up and put my hand on her shoulder.
Matt: "Keyleth!"
Marisha: Hey! How's it going?
Matt: "Better."
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: I lean up against the bar, next to you guys.
Marisha: Want to check in on Allura?
Matt: "Let's do it."
Marisha: Is there an empty room around here?
Matt: She looks over to the barkeep. You all stare over and the barkeep is currently there like wiping down the bar section. "For how long?"
Laura: For a couple hours.
Marisha: Doesn't need to be that long.
Matt: "Two silver?"
Laura: We saved your life? And the entire town.
Matt: "You are fine to use it as you please for the remainder of the afternoon. Just don't mess it up, please."
Marisha: Sure. We'll try really hard to find better things to do with our time. Okay.
Matt: All right, you make your way up and the place is fairly vacant, there are a couple of rooms that are currently partially-- the doors are ajar and you hear voices in there, and you recognize it's a couple of the refugees that you guys brought over from your keep, currently holed up in this tavern. An inn floor on the second floor. But there are a number of open rooms right now that you could go ahead and step into for use.
Marisha: Just pick one.
Matt: Okay. So. Do you want to go ahead and attempt a Scry ritual?
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: Focusing on...?
Marisha: The flower that I gave her before we left.
Laura: Ooh, good call.
Matt: All right, so. As you all sit down, Kima sitting across from you, arms closed. She looks at you intensely with this really direct glare, waiting for some sort of sign of an answer or information. As you complete the ritual preparation of the scrying, your vision transcends your form, jettisoned through the ceiling and into the clouds. Clouds rush past, you can feel the wind pushing across your face, your hair, and as the clouds part you see, below, you see Westruun. And from Westruun you can see most of the city, as you recall, and a large portion of it currently looks toppled-over and pushed into ruin. There are no longer burning black clouds, but white smoke, long after a fire or some sort of an impact, lazily drifting off some of those ruins. It focuses even closer, and you see very little populace in the streets. Most everyone's either indoors or not visible at the moment. Your vision clicks in once again, and you can see currently some sort of dark room hidden in Westruun. You see, for a brief instant, a flicker of light, and you see Drake Thunderbrand and Allura both gathering a few small books under their arms, silently waiting, quietly. You hear (impact sounds) some heavy footfalls above. They both just stay quiet, stay quiet. Allura stays still for a moment. She looks over at Drake. They both take hands and then (whoosh) convert into that same energy form you saw that jettisoned out of Greyskull Keep, that echoes down a long hallway that you previously didn't see was attached to this room. It leads to a stone spiral staircase that goes upward before these two dual sparks travel through the small crack between where the edge of a trap door and a wooden floor is as the sparks course upward into the now-setting sun. You can see amongst the sparks the mostly collapsed rubble of the Cobalt Reserve, the large library in the center of Westruun. You can see dozens of corpses that have been largely dissolved. You can see what remnants of their bodies have been eaten away by some sort of caustic material, their arms and fingers tightened up as the muscles pull into this horrible, gnarled visage of what once were the living residents of Westruun. You do see, as the spark comes to a stop for a second in its movement, and you hear briefly overhead (wingbeats) and you see rush overhead, wings fully spread, the black dragon that you had briefly encountered in Emon streak upward, roaring loudly, towards Gatshadow, the tall, dark spire mountain just north of Westruun. (whoosh) And as it heads up there, the sparks (electric sound) continue their trek through the streets, and at that point the ritual fades, its vision unable to maintain its focus. Your vision is pulled back up into the clouds and then thrust back into your current position and with a shock you find yourself back in the tavern.
Laura: What did you see? Is she all right?
Marisha: She's alive, her and Drake both are alive.
Matt: "Good. Where are they going?"
Marisha: They're at the Cobalt Reserve, which is in ruins, as well as the rest of Westruun.
Laura: Did you see the dragon?
Marisha: Yes, the black dragon is there. Looks like he's taken up residence in the black spire-- tower. What was it called?
Laura: Gatshadow?
Marisha: That one.
Marisha: Gatshadow. Allura--
Laura: Could you communicate with her when you scry? I don't know how it works.
Marisha: No, I can just look in and see.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: She was grabbing the last few important tomes, remnants left from the Cobalt Library, I mean, Reserve.
Matt: "They staying in Westruun?"
Marisha: It didn't look like it.
Matt: "Where are they going?"
Marisha: I don't know, I didn't see.
Matt: "Did you talk about where you--"
Laura: We left word. And told her we were coming here.
Matt: "Here to Whitestone?"
Laura: Yes. If you wait, she'll be here.
Matt: "Who else is coming?"
Laura: Drake.
Matt: "Drake. Anybody else on the Council coming?"
Sam: We brought some Council members, right? Were any among our--
Matt: You're not there, you're with Grog.
Sam: Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, oh, I'm not there! (laughter)
Sam: So, Grog! Want to play some bocce ball? (laughter)
Marisha: I don't know who all's coming.
Laura: Uriel.
Matt: "Dead? Well, that's great. That's fantastic. What about the rest?"
Marisha: His wife and children are here.
Matt: "Here, okay."
Marisha: As well as Gilmore.
Laura: Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Matt: "Right, right."
Laura: Wonderful place to buy all sorts of products, if it were still... standing.
Matt: "Huh. I've only heard things, I've not met this 'Gilmore'."
Marisha: You haven't met Gilmore!? Man, I just assume everyone knows each other.
Matt: "Anybody else? Tofor?"
Laura: Yes, maybe...? Yes, Tofor...?
Marisha: He might have... been... slain...?
Laura: Which one is Tofor?
Marisha: She's the dragonborn--
Laura: Yes, Tofor-- they did, I think Tofor is-- definitely maybe here.
Matt: Last you heard, two Council members that were confirmed still alive by Gilmore when you found him-- or, confirmed by Uriel's wife and family-- thank you, sorry, were Tofor and Asum.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: So both were two of the ones that were saved by Gilmore, and then once he was too wounded to continue, they left to seek for survivors in Emon. That was the last you heard of them.
Laura: Oh. They're not actually here, then. Yes. They're looking for other survivors, Tofor and Asum.
Matt: "In the place where this-- and what's this dragon you keep talking about?"
Laura: Oh, shit, you don't know anything. Thordak! Big. Terrible. Red.
Matt: As you say the name again, you can see her eyes resonate with a clarity, and where once was this very intense expression and air of demanding information suddenly recedes into this look of sudden fear, and she's briefly lost in thought.
Laura: Yes, you defeated him once. He escaped the Fire Realm.
Marisha: Not only did he escape, he tore a giant tear in the rifts between the Fire Realm and ours.
Matt: (sighs deeply) "Thordak." And you can see, she's starting to hyperventilate suddenly, like, for all of her strong exterior, this is the first time, aside from the brief hit of the beholder's ray earlier, you see fear in her eyes, and she starts standing up. (pants) "I need to get some air."
Marisha: Kima, Kima, it'll be--
Matt: "I need to--"
Marisha: Sit here, you want to sit down?
Matt: "I need to get s-- I need to get some air." And she storms out of the room.
Marisha: Let's go outside.
Laura: Actually, Keyleth--
Marisha: What?
Laura: I shut the door behind Kima.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: I want to talk to you.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: I would ask my brother, but, knowing him, he would walk away. What happened?
Marisha: Keyleth has a hard time looking her in the eye.
Laura: Look at me, Keyleth! Be strong! You're royalty. Tell me what happened.
Marisha: Vex, I don't want to ever see you like that again. I don't want to ever see anybody like that again.
Laura: I grab both sides of her face and force her to look at me. I'm all right. I'm still here. Okay? I need you to tell me what happened. Because between us? Vax is off. Something's wrong. And I need to know what it is.
Marisha: We all watched you die.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: It's like--
Laura: How did I get back? Who brought me back? Kashaw, Zahra, my brother. Anyone else?
Marisha: I guess... you could say, probably an unseen entity, an unseen force. Oh, I'm lightheaded.
Laura: Sit down.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: There's a bed. Sit down.
Marisha: Percy--
Laura: Percy helped.
Marisha: Let's skip that. When we brought you back, Kashaw performed a resurrection ritual.
Laura: Like we did with Pike.
Marisha: Yes. And he called upon a deity and at first he was afraid that it was Vesh. Which he was quite terrified about.
Laura: His wife.
Marisha: Yes. That, I don't believe, is the presence that answered his call.
Laura: Okay. Fluttery words here, darling. Get to the point.
Marisha: I thought I was going to lose you both. I thought I was going to lose you and Vax.
Laura: Why Vax? Did he get hurt as well? No. What did he do?
Marisha: He-- I don't know. I don't know what he did. He said to take him instead, is what he told the entity. He offered his life for yours. And my biggest fear was that neither of you were going to come back. He offered his life for you. And for all we know, that offer was accepted.
Laura: Right.
Marisha: If I had to guess, it was probably the Raven Queen herself.
Laura: Well. It's rather suiting, isn't it?
Marisha: He seems to do that quite a lot.
Laura: Yes. Keyleth? Thank you, dear. And I leave.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I stay behind and burst into tears.
Matt: Okay. Grog and Scanlan! What're you guys doing? (relieved laughter)
Liam: (Grog voice) Go fish.
Travis: So-- what do you want to do?
Sam: I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it. Do you have any games with you?
Travis: No.
Sam: Anything in the Bag of Holding?
Travis: I think there's some orc parts in there that've been in for a couple months.
Sam: Doesn't sound very fun.
Travis: Right. I got all nervous when they mentioned a goliath's cave, so I need to go boom-boom.
Sam: Should I play a song so no one can hear it?
Travis: Might help. Like, stand guard outside the door.
Sam: Yeah, yeah. A little muzak.
Travis: Would you mind?
Sam: It's what I'm here for.
Travis: Can I go drop some ordnance?
Matt: And as you find one of the few local ramshackle outhouses-- none are quite goliath-sized, and it's an uncomfortable experience, but thank God you brought a bard along or you would have woken up half the populace just going to bed, as Scanlan, I--
Sam: Nothing to see here, everybody! (plays random chords on the harmonica) Nothing to see here!
Travis: (coughs, then farts) Oh!
Laura: Okay, okay, okay, okay. (laughter)
Travis: Now, the music's playing, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: It's just a stall, just me?
Matt: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: All right, can I take out Craven Edge?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: All right.
Marisha: In the outhouse? Sorry, keep going!
Travis: It's the palace, this is where all the best thoughts and conversations happen! I don't know how it is at your house.
Liam: Keep in mind how confined it is, okay?
Travis: Yeah!
Liam: And go. (laughter)
Matt: Yes. (grunting)
Sam: Sounds like a rough one in there, buddy!
Matt: As you (chuckles) as you see one of the wood boards splinter out the side for a second--
Sam: Ah, yup, that's tacos!
Travis: You might want to play a bit louder and maybe take a few steps away, it's about to get violent.
Sam: No problem!
Travis: Yep.
Matt: At that moment you focus, and as you can feel the blade itself grow cold in your fingertips, you can see what little bit of light that filters through the bright orangish-red color that's coming from the sunset, you can see a reflection in the obsidian blade as a voice comes to your ear and says, "You fed me well."
Travis: Yeah, I did, right? I mean, we are really doing well. Question: so, when we were fighting that big Earthbreaker Groot-looking guy, he called you a 'dark weapon'. Does that-- do you have feelings, and did that hurt them?
Matt: There's a brief pause before you hear this long, drawn-out, (heavy sigh).
Travis: Right, hold on! No, no, listen. And I take my thumb and I run it against the blade real quick.
Matt: Okay. As you do, all of a sudden the voice goes, (gasp, contented exhale).
Travis: Right, yep, sorry, listen. So, my question is, as much as I love opening up people to feed you, I want to know, like-- what's in it for you?
Sam: Grog, are you talking to your shit?
Travis: Yeah, no, you got to let it know who's boss!
Sam: Okay.
Matt: The voice creeps in again, this time. "There is no feeling more terrifying than hunger. And I hunger forever. You help satiate that hunger. That is our arrangement. I give you the strength of those you cut down, and I feed upon them. If this is unsatisfactory, I can and have found others who are more willing to be part of this arrangement--"
Travis: No, no, no, I'm a big fan, really, I mean, I am yoked out when I'm using you, it's fucking amazing. I mean, people are flying apart, it's like a dream. But listen, can you ever be... full?
Matt: "I have never been full before. Perhaps you're the one to find out."
Travis: I'll bet I am, actually, you're really lucky you found me and not these other blokes, not even half the man I am. But listen, so, there's no, like, endgame, just to be clear, you just want to drink and drink, 'cause I've seen the blood, right? And usually I wipe it off, but you, like, suck it in, and that's a little unsettling, not going to lie.
Matt: "My hunger grows, but the air tarnishes my blade. Perhaps we can continue this conversation elsewhere."
Travis: (farts) Right, yeah, right. Not even a problem. Well, look, I like the way you cut people open, so we'll continue this another time. And I sheathe him.
Matt: All right. As you sheathe, the last thing he says is, "Don't forget: I hunger always."
Travis: I kick the door open, and I'm like, if you're within 200 feet, back up!
Sam: No one's out here, Grog.
Travis: Oh.
Sam: Just me. Are you all right?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I heard you say something about blood.
Travis: Yeah, no, am I sweating? It was a real workout, that one.
Sam: At some point you said, "Are you full?" Are you talking about-- did you fill it all the way up?
Travis: Yeah, the privy, you know, it was starting to give my bum a tickle.
Sam: Wow!
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: You topped it off!
Travis: Yeah. Because, you know, you don't want to, like, dip in the muck, it's, you know--
Laura: Foul.
Sam: Not at all.
Travis: Did you want to--
Sam: I think I'm good.
Travis: Are you sure? I warmed it up for you, it's, like, ready to go.
Sam: I love a good deuce, but not today, I think.
Travis: All right. Fair enough. But I'm feeling so, like, vacated--
Sam: We should go get a bite.
Travis: I think you're right!
Sam: (laughs) All right, let's go.
Travis: (laughing) Okay.
Matt: Okay. You guys are getting a bite. Percival, if you want to go ahead and make a tinkering check with dexterity modifier to create more ammunition.
Taliesin: Tinkering check with dexterity modifier?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Should be plus 11.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. We'll say, in the time that you've had here, with the materials you purchased, and Whitestone's pretty open to supplying you--
Taliesin: I've got a thing.
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you're able to create roughly 40 or so simple bullets in the time that you have.
Taliesin: Do I have time to poke at a modification to the explosive arrow? I want to try and build a rock breaker. I'm curious to try and build an arrow for taking down walls or taking down doors.
Matt: Like a siege arrow?
Taliesin: A light form of siege arrow. Basically, I want to have a tip that actually manages to breach stone and then an explosion that goes outwards, so it's a shattering arrow.
Matt: All right, this'll take the remainder of your evening. You're not going to be able to do much else after this.
Taliesin: I have nothing else to do.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make a tinkering check with your intelligence modifier.
Taliesin: Okay. So... That's 23.
Matt: 23, okay. At the cost of roughly 150 gold pieces, as you have to go through a few different attempts to finally get the design right, and the metalworking you have here is not perfected. You're not at your workshop back at the keep, unfortunately, so you have to work with whatever you have here, and nothing here is designed for the--
Taliesin: No, I've got an okay workshop here.
Matt: Yeah. The one that you used before, previously, but that's from mostly discarded and-- in the time that you've been gone, it's been cannibalized for a lot of different uses. But it's makeshift. You manage to complete what you think could function. You're not entirely certain as to what the final effect will be, but it all seems to be in place.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: So you can write down 'Explosive Siege Arrow'.
Taliesin: Siege arrow.
Matt: And we shall find out in time what it does.
Marisha: Siege arrow. That's fun.
Taliesin: A few things I've been working on, and that's one of them.
Matt: So. Are you guys resting for the evening? Anything else you wish to accomplish?
Laura: That would probably be smart. I'm pretty tired after dying, so I'm going to go to sleep.
Matt: Okay. Vax, anything you want to accomplish before you--
Taliesin: God, the guilt. Okay. Yeah.
Sam: Can I buy a torch somewhere? Just a torch?
Matt: Sure! Yeah, torches are relatively easy to find. You want to try one?
Sam: Three.
Matt: Three torches. That's three copper.
Laura: I bring Trinket into the castle with me, just so you know.
Matt: After all this has happened, Trinket has been, like, almost locked to you. Even you going upstairs into the tavern, Trinket was like, (plaintive bear noises) stayed out front, 'cause Trinket's learned at this point, you can't really go into all the taverns.
Laura: It's hard, it's hard.
Matt: It's rough, being a bear.
Sam: And wherever we're eating, does it happen to be near Jameson the painter's workshop?
Matt: No, but it's about a 20-minute walk, if you wanted to go find him.
Sam: Be nice to check in with him. Grog, do you mind walking with me?
Travis: Absolutely not.
Sam: All right, so we'll truck on over to Jameson's.
Matt: Okay. You head up to it, and this gentleman is a painter as well as a stablehand, so you find your way to the facility, knock on it, and immediately as the door opens, the smell of fresh manure hits your nose and Jameson steps out. "Can I-- you!"
Sam: Yes! Hi!
Matt: "Hi!"
Sam: I've come back.
Matt: "I meant to deliver, but they told me not to, because apparently it's not there anymore?"
Sam: The town, you mean.
Matt: "Town, yeah, where I was supposed to deliver it to you."
Sam: It was wise of you to keep this precious artifact here, because it would've surely been destroyed en route or when it arrived--
Matt: "It's just the canvas, I don't have a-- It's a bit too large for my specifications of framing, but--"
Sam: I'm sure it's huge. Did you finish it?
Matt: "Yes, yes! Come, come!"
Sam: Can I look?
Travis: Oh please, oh please!
Sam: (laughing) Okay, let's go look!
Matt: He takes one of the hooded lanterns and turns up the oil wick on it, and as he turns away he brings you into the back stable area where it's been sectioned off, and you can see there's paints that have been dropped all across the ground and the hay, it's this multicolored spattering, this rainbow vomit across this section of hay floor, and there in all of its glory, stretched across and nailed at the corners to this far, far wall, you see a fantastical landscape of rolling hills and treelines rising up at the edges. You can see a mountainscape in the distance. The lighting he uses is magnificent. You can see why many people in the city specifically requested that you go to this gentleman. There atop this fantastic green hilltop, you see on this fine white and grey steed as it raises up, hooves in the air, is yourself, shirt open, chest slightly fuzzy and muscular. As you look off, your hair blowing in the breeze--
Sam: How's the face? How's the face?
Matt: The face is pretty damn spot-on.
Sam: Yes! (laughter)
Matt: The best likeness you can find for somebody who only had a brief reference, as he sketched you quickly before he left, and there behind, clutching you, from the side you can see Pike wearing these long greyish-silver and blue robes that are also flowing behind, a long train-- longer than it needs to be, stylistically it was a choice in the artistics point of this-- it is everything you hoped it would be. You paid good money for this piece.
Sam: I'm going to request-- Grog, I need a minute here.
Travis: Oh, yeah. I understand, take--
Sam: Just to weep.
Travis: Take all the time you need.
Sam: So I regard it for a few minutes, taking in the beauty and the wonder of all I've accomplished--
Marisha: I have a question. Would Keyleth and Scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time?
Matt: Right now? Yes. For different reasons entirely.
Sam: (singing) Somewhere out there...
Taliesin: (singing) Somewhere out there...
Travis: Look at the air, look at the air high-five. There it is.
Sam: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Taliesin: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Marisha: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Travis: So white. That was the whitest of white high fives ever.
Taliesin: I'm imagining this as a canvas of Lisa Frank majesty, by the way. Like, the greatest Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper cover in all the land.
Matt: Oh, man. (laughter)
Sam: After I weep for a few minutes, I thank Jameson again and how much did I pay him for this thing? You've gone above and beyond, Jameson, and I know that you're a humble man and you don't want me to spread word of your accomplishments, but please allow me to write you an epic poem or a song and tell of your artistic gifts and talents, please.
Matt: "That would be a fine tip, sir. Please, yes, do so."
Sam: I'll get right on it.
Matt: "Send them back to Whitestone, please, ask for Jameson. The more I work this, hopefully I can make my way out of this dunghole."
Sam: Don't worry, you'll have lots of commissions after this, I promise you.
Matt: "Great."
Sam: And I'm going to give him an extra 50 gold.
Matt: "I, um--"
Liam: That's more than the price of a book.
Matt: "Sir, I-- thank you. Thank you, thank you."
Sam: For art supplies to get your shop up and running.
Matt: "Of course." He looks down and he's gotten a little bit of paint on the coins, he's like, (muttering and stammering). He puts it aside somewhere. "Thank you--" Wipes his hands off on a nearby rag. "Thank you." And takes your hand and shakes it vigorously.
Sam: So, can it be--
Matt: Yeah, he goes in and he takes his little claw hammer down, starts pulling the nails out from the sides and gingerly rolls up the canvas. It takes a good, like, three minutes to roll the thing up, and it's quite heavy as he hands it over to you-- (heavy grunt) In your hand, yeah, it almost takes you off your feet.
Sam: Grog! Grog!
Travis: What?
Sam: Can you hold this for me?
Travis: No, it's you, I mean, you're so magnificent in it--
Sam: No, I can't do it.
Travis: I don't know it-- I really--
Sam: Grog! I watched you shit for an hour!
Travis: Hey, all right, I'll pick it up.
Matt: All right. You guys find your way out. At this point night has taken; you can hear the crickets starting to spread throughout the city. As the rest of the blue night sky takes on-- Evening is ready, do you guys have anything else to accomplish before the evening comes to a close?
Liam: Wait 'til it's quiet. And I leave the room that I've been given at Whitestone. And I find my sister's door. And I stand outside it, and I stare at it for a minute--
Laura: Vax? Is that you?
Liam: And I stealth away.
Laura: I open the door.
Matt: Roll a stealth check, roll a perception check.
Laura: Shit.
Liam: 25.
Laura: 22. Damn it.
Matt: Nothing to be seen. Must have been your imagination, Vex.
Travis: He's good.
Liam: And I wait for the door to close. And then I walk to Keyleth's door. And I knock.
Matt: You hear a knock at your door.
Laura: And horses.
Matt: The clomping of horse hooves in the distance, apparently.
Marisha: I open it. Hey. Hi. You okay?
Liam: I don't know.
Marisha: Come in. Sit down.
Liam: I go in.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: How do you feel?
Liam: I don't know. All I know is... that I felt her. I don't know magic, I don't know anything. I open doors, and only when the wind is blowing in the right direction, sometimes, I think. I don't know what happened, but I felt her.
Marisha: Do you still feel her?
Matt: Make a perception check, Vax.
Liam: 22.
Matt: As you're sitting there, looking down at the ground, as she asks this question, you notice the symbol of Sarenrae that you have stitched into the back of your glove, what was once a very vibrant, goldish-brass color has actually very heavily tarnished, and the metal itself seems to have cracked in three places. It was not this way a day before.
Liam: Yeah. I don't know if I did anything in there, and I wouldn't take it back if I did, but I don't know what I'm doing.
Marisha: I don't know if it was very noble or very stupid, to be honest. Probably a little bit of both. I can attempt a Greater Restoration spell, and see if I can sense anything.
Liam: I don't know anything about any of that. I'll let you.
Marisha: Can I?
Matt: Yeah. So as you prepare your mindset for the cleansing ritual that is the Greater Restoration--
Marisha: Just lay back.
Matt: As soon as the dull green energy begins to course across your fingertips, and as you touch the edge of his shoulder to impart his body with the cleansing energy, it courses through his shoulders, the spell completes. You sense no difference in your current physicality, mindset, and there's this pause, this silence, of no realization, that is suddenly shattered by the sound of a (caws). You look over and at the stone edge of the window you guys are staying in, you see stepping there a single dark raven, (clicks, rapid flapping) and it takes off and flies into the night.
Marisha: I think this goes beyond any natural realm that I have any bearing over. And I hug him. I thought I was going to lose you. And I'm terrified I'm still going to.
Liam: Keyleth, I love you.
Marisha: And I think I love you. I just don't know if I can allow myself to. I'm terrified to allow myself to. You do realize that, if by some crazy chance, we all somehow make it through this domination alive, with the Chroma Conclave, and I complete my Aramente, I'll still watch all of you die. Everything could go phenomenally well. And by becoming Headmaster, we enter a bit of a realm of immortality where I could live for a very, very long time. I'm afraid every time I look at one of your faces that it's going to be the last, and I feel like deep down I know that day is coming. So because of that I'm afraid to let myself feel anything deeper than I already do.
Liam: I quickly leave her room.
Matt: The door closes behind Vax.
Marisha: And for the second time today Keyleth bursts into tears. Why do people keep leaving me in rooms alone?
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Stop it, you're wasting water.
Marisha: We're in a drought, god damn it!
Laura: When was the last time you showered, Keyleth?
Marisha: It's been a while.
Taliesin: Makeup's runny.
Liam: Go water elemental.
Matt: It's the only way. All right, as you all find yourself coming to rest for the evening, some of you easier than others, eventually you get your full rest. Those who heal up to, say, full hit points for a good night's rest here, get your hit dice back, so not a whole lot were spent.
Travis: I lose my strength bonuses.
Matt: Morning comes to you all, and-- yes?
Liam: Sorry, just one detail. From there, I went and fell asleep in this idiot's doorway.
Matt: Okay. All right. We will go ahead and take a quick break, we will see you guys back here shortly to see what is in store for Vox Machina. So we'll be back here in a minute. [break]
Liam: Matt, shit on my face.
Matt: Welcome back, everybody!
Sam: It's too close!
Laura: They caught it, that one caught it.
Matt: That was pretty close.
Liam: All they heard was "ace."
Matt: It's all good. Welcome back, guys. We're going to go ahead and jump back in. So as you all, after that, for some, emotional evening, whether that be conversational emotion or, you know, having to go drop an emotional deuce. You know, that's important. You find yourselves waking up to a fresh morning in Whitestone, hints of blue sky breaking through the cloud coverage, and that's rare for this area because it's the northern portion of the continent, you know that, especially being so close to the ocean, a lot of the cloud, heavy precipitation makes its way in the direction of your town, so it's nice to have a little break in that. Nonetheless, as you guys come to consciousness and gather yourselves, your things, and your plans for the day, what do you wish to do?
Taliesin: We are a city of seasonal affectation disorder, so.
Laura: Well, I open my door and find my brother falling through it.
Liam: I'm awake.
Laura: Oh, good morning.
Liam: Hi.
Laura: Comfortable bed, I see.
Liam: Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't find my room.
Laura: Yeah, it's confusing, all these, all these doors.
Liam: What time's it?
Laura: I have no idea. My nature check tells me it's roughly, I dunno, eight? Nine? Something like that. Seven? Maybe seven.
Liam: Come here, you shithead. Don't fucking do that again.
Laura: It's not like I did it on--
Liam: Don't fucking do that again, all right? Just don't fucking do it again.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Fuck.
Laura: I can't breathe. You're about to kill me again.
Liam: You'll live, you'll live. Jesus. Whoever that is.
Laura: So-- (laughs) I heard a rumor that you sort of saved my life in a really creepy sort of way. I talk to people. I talk to so many people. I find out things. Secrets aren't safe when Vex is around.
Liam: Is there any coffee in this fucking castle?
Laura: Wait, wait, wait, I have a present for you, because I feel like you're going to really like it. Would you like it?
Liam: That's random. All right.
Laura: I have this armor that I think would be really great on you. Do you want it? It's really expensive. If you don't take it quickly, I might change my mi--
Liam: I don't want it.
Laura: Oh, that was expensive cardstock. (laughter)
Liam: I'll give you the leather armor after I have a chance to change.
Laura: All right. I love you.
Liam: (softly) I know. I know.
Laura: Let's get breakfast.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: From that point, the smell of coffee begins to fill the air from the inside of the Whitestone castle halls. The servants have prepared breakfast, and a meal is ready for you. Grog jumping to attention as the scent reaches your nose. The rest of you all slowly find your way back down. You eat--
Marisha: Do we come out and see Vax in the armor?
Matt: Are you putting on the armor?
Liam: I'm just looking at it in the hallway.
Marisha: So I guess I step out and see him looking at it in the hallway.
Liam: Still pretty tired, to be honest. Didn't sleep a lot in the doorway.
Matt: Yeah. Some of you guys step out, and you see Vax standing in the hallway, clutching in his hands, looking over all the various, like, pushed-in, engraved runes across the leatherwork, the raven feathers that adorn the bottom of the mantle.
Laura: Careful, it smells a lot like must and mold and birds.
Marisha: I walk by and... briefly lock eyes and keep going without saying anything.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Oh shit, you got the armor now?
Laura: He stole it, what can I say? He is a really sneaky, stealthy kind of guy.
Travis: Nice.
Laura: Yeah. Fair and square.
Liam: I just took it for fashion purposes, I suppose.
Travis: Oh, you need all the help you can get.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Should we go out in the woods and unleash an undead beast that will kill us all?
Travis: Yes! Christmas morning! Who has that, by the way?
Sam: I do.
Travis: Oh! Yeah!
Sam: Don't worry, it's safe.
Travis: Where d'you keep it?
Sam: Oh! Hold on-- Got a pouch or some-- you know what? It's back in my room.
Matt: All right. You go retrieve it.
Sam: Got it!
Travis: Where's Percy?
Laura: Where's Pike? We should bring her with us. Can we bring Pike with us? I know she's taking care of Gilmore, but.
Sam: Mm, that's possibly more important. I think this thing'll be fine!
Laura: We need some sort of somebody that can heal, I think we've learned this for ourselves.
Sam: I can heal!
Travis: Yeah, we got potions, we're fine. It's probably, like, a big Saint Bernard. What's the big deal?
Laura: (sighs) Okay. We learn nothing, carry on.
Travis: Where's Percy?
Taliesin: I'm right here.
Travis: Oh! Shit, you were quiet. Hello.
Taliesin: (coughs) Hello. Good morning.
Travis: Need any coffee? An enema?
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: A coffee enema?
Taliesin: What!? No. I'm fine. Good morning.
Liam: I'm going to walk off with this shit.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And we go outside with the necklace.
Sam: Yeah, where're we headed?
Travis: The woods!
Laura: No. The caves. I thought we were going to the--
Marisha: Going to the caves on the edge of the woods.
Matt: Yeah. It's the caves that are--
Marisha: Going to go through the woods.
Liam: (sings) Into the woods!
Matt: So. You all gather together and make your way northwest of Whitestone, towards where you found the stone giant fortress and the series of caves that are in the mountain behind it. You get there; it's still seemingly abandoned. You case the area for a while. No noticeable movement other than a few woodland entities that exist in that vicinity.
Laura: Primeval Awareness! (radar sounds)
Matt: Okay. That is now the sound it makes every time you do it.
Laura: I like it.
Matt: Yeah, so hold onto that one. I'll make that a new ringtone sound for you guys. What are you looking for?
Laura: Oh, there's so many things I could sense!
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: What about sirens?
Laura: Sirens?
Travis: Wait, what are those things called? The things that took our horses the last time we were here?
Matt: Harpies?
Travis: Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Laura: Sure! Harpies.
Matt: For how many miles is it?
Laura: Six miles!
Matt: Six miles? Yeah, there's a few blips on the far, far western side of here. You get the essence way off in the mountains, there's maybe a small nest. Nothing that's immediately dangerous.
Laura: What about if I sit for one more minute and I think if I can sense any giants.
Matt: You do, to the far, far north. You get the sense that there is some sort of giant-based lifeform maybe two, three miles north of you.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: How's it look?
Laura: Well, I mean, clear of the things I checked for. No giants.
Travis: Sweet! Let's go! Up to the cave!
Matt: All right. So the fortress or the caves behind it?
Travis: Fortress or cave?
Laura: Were they both empty? I don't remember.
Taliesin: Everything was empty, if I recall.
Travis: Yeah. Small space.
Taliesin: Let's do the caves.
Laura: All right, sure. Cave.
Travis: Yeah. Cave.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Oh, if we stick to the woods, it's my favored terrain. If we go into a cave, not as much.
Sam: The caves would contain it. It can't fly away or anything.
Travis: So is it like, cave-fortress, are they same level? I can't remember.
Matt: It's a pathway that leads up into a small ravine in the mountain pass where you guys originally walked down into Whitestone. Up against the north side of where the mountain meets that ravine, there's a big stone fortress that is built into the side of the mountain, and then around that are a series of smaller caves.
Liam: (singing) Anything can happen in the woods.
Travis: Yeah, let's go to this fortress, then we got more room to move in case it does suck.
Sam: All right, fine, fortress.
Matt: You guys find your way inside, the cold morning air still has encompassed the stone floor itself, you can see there are still the scattered and slowly decomposing bits of meat and flesh in the far corner, you still see the splatters of blood that have turned black and cracked as it dried. No corpses here, as the corpses were retooled by the Briarwoods while they were in control. The fortress other than that is still empty, and seemingly untouched since you last left it.
Sam: All right, well, I'm just going to do it then!
Laura: Wait wait wait!
Marisha: Wait wait wait!
Marisha: Wait, there's doors open to the cave, right?
Sam: We're in a fortress.
Taliesin: We're in a fortress.
Marisha: Fortress. Whatever.
Matt: (laughs) Coffee's just starting to kick in for you guys.
Laura: Just barely! Do we have any buff spells or some shit that we should cast, to make us cooler?
Marisha: Should I throw a wall up?
Sam: A wall for what?
Marisha: Do I need to bar the entrance? Or are there doors?
Taliesin: Vex, by the way--
Matt: There are doors, but they're partially ajar where you left them.
Laura: Aww, put it on, it's useful!
Liam: No. We're not having this conversation.
Taliesin: Vex, by the way, I've got something for you.
Laura: What? Yes, dear?
Taliesin: And I pull out the arrow.
Laura: What is this?
Taliesin: This is an evening of unbridled guilt. Come here, let me show you. In theory, this is a siege arrow.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Shattering stone, shattering doors, breaking things that should not be broken.
Laura: Breaking hearts left and right?
Taliesin: If that is what you're after. It should work! Never forget you're my favorite, and I'm so sorry.
Laura: I kiss him on the cheek. Thank you, Percy.
Taliesin: That was much nicer than your brother.
Laura: Is that a black eye?
Taliesin: (stammering) I didn't sleep.
Laura: Huh. This is lovely, I can't wait to use it.
Taliesin: There'll be more.
Sam: All right, in three, two--
Travis: Wait hold on, hold on hold on!
Taliesin: In a circle! Aim it into the center of the circle.
Liam: And is it three-two-one, three-two-one-do it, or three-two-one and go,
Sam: On the one. On one.
Taliesin: It's Jenga, one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand four one-thousand.
Sam: Should one of us leave the room in case it comes out and paralyzes all of us? Just going to throw that out there.
Travis: Oh yeah, we should, what do you call it, spread out?
Laura: Yeah, definitely, let's all surround it and make sure we're not all clumped up.
Taliesin: If only someone had armor that could make them immune to paralysis.
Liam: That's not a bad idea, you get controlled by things. Maybe you could wait just a little bit further back?
Laura: This was somebody's pet, all right? It's probably not smart enough to take control of our minds.
Liam: That's a big if.
Travis: I don't mind stepping out, but I would like to be able to see.
Laura: Yeah yeah yeah!
Liam: Yeah! We won't shut the door, I just want you outside of any potential blast radius.
Taliesin: Let's spread out in a circle; we'll let it loose in the center, that way it can't even see all of us.
Laura: All right, I like it. It only gets to see Scanlan.
Sam: It can see me.
Laura: I'm going to stealth.
Sam: Well, when a thing is born, it latches on to the first thing it sees, like its mama.
Liam: Yes, we're going to hide.
Matt: All right, stealth check from both of you guys?
Marisha: So we're going to try and talk to it?
Laura: Yeah, Scanlan's going to talk to it.
Marisha: Scanlan? You prepared?
Laura: Natural 20!
Taliesin: You just teleport, there's like a phase effect.
Matt: The two of you back off and find the nearby shaded corners, where some of the haphazardly tossed hides and furs are in the corner, you vanish behind the alcoves keeping a watch.
Laura: Trinket, don't stand next to me, it gives it away. Go stand next to Keyleth!
Travis: Is there a doorway in the fortress?
Matt: Yeah, there's the main doorway you guys entered, which is two--
Travis: Can I stand in that, then?
Matt: Sure, you stand there, in the entranceway that's pushed open, which is wide enough for a giant to push through. You got a little bit of room to each side, but you're there.
Travis: Vax, is this g-- Vax?
Taliesin: It's fine, you're fine.
Sam: Here we go, guys.
Marisha: So, those two are stealthed-- I'm at Scanlan's left shoulder, back a bit.
Laura: And Trinket's next to you!
Marisha: And Trinket's next to me. I'm rolling with Trinket.
Taliesin: I've got a little bit of distance, yes, that's good.
Matt: All righty, and there's Percy here, and Travis is off this way. Good to know.
Sam: I don't know how to use this thing.
Marisha: Yeah, we don't know how to use it.
Sam: By the power of Raven's Slumber, I command thee: (yells) awaken! Beast! Cruel or otherwise! Face your new master, and know his name is Scanlan! (laughter)
Travis: (laughing) Oh, holy shit! Never could've been better.
Matt: As you spend your bonus action to release the gate hold on the crystal, you guys see as he thrusts his hands forward, there's a burst of shadow energy that, almost like someone throwing a big pot of water, this blackness goes out of it, and then as it hits the ground, it spills into smoke on the ground, and as that dark form stops, it is in the form of an about waist-to-lower-torso-height creature. As the form coalesces into its normal self, you can see before you, shaking its head, a rather large, dark grey and black wolf. (growls, snarls)
Sam: Easy, easy.
Travis: Told you it was a dog.
Sam: Garlic? Galdric, Galdric, easy, Galdric. Easy. We're friends. Here.
Matt: He's backing up a little bit, snarling. You see Trinket starts growling, (growls).
Laura: Trinket, be nice-- oh!
Matt: As you say that (snarls) it looks over at you in the far corner.
Laura: (whispers) I'm natural 20! That still didn't see me!
Marisha: I pet Trinket, like, 'Chill, chill, be cool'.
Matt: Trinket backs up a little bit, but still locking eyes. You can see this wolf now, its gums and teeth are bared, its fur is all puffed up, its tail is-- it's definitely holding its ground and trying to make itself look as intimidating as possible.
Sam: Is it a small beast?
Matt: This would be, technically, borderline medium. This'd be medium, technically.
Sam: I can only speak with small beasts.
Marisha: Wait, use Speak with Animals?
Liam: (laughs) She swatted me and said, 'Put your armor on,' so I'm doing it.
Matt: Okay. That'll take you about 15 minutes.
Laura: Aw.
Liam: 15 minutes! Well, guess I'm doing it.
Matt: All right. You don't just slip on leather armor. (chuckles)
Liam: No, I get that, I get that, I would've guessed two minutes.
Travis: Can somebody check to see if it's actually a wolf or just looks like one? Like, check it?
Laura: Can I use my perception?
Matt: You're a bit far away from it right now. You can try to get closer if you want.
Laura: Can I sneak?
Matt: Yeah, make another stealth check.
Laura: I do get advantage, because of my cloak. Sweet.
Liam: You should yell out, 'I'm stealthing'.
Laura: I'm stealthing! Damn it. 19?
Matt: Okay. As you begin making your way forward, it doesn't seem to notice you.
Laura: Hey, it doesn't?
Matt: No.
Laura: Can I see it better now to perceive it?
Matt: Looking right at it, and from your experience in the wild as well, and Keyleth, you're getting it, this does not appear to be anything beyond a large wolf.
Taliesin: I'm going to get on my knees and put out my hand and call it. Galdric, Galdric.
Matt: Go ahead and make an animal handling check.
Sam: Animal handling! We've never done that before!
Laura: If I help my brother get on the armor, will it happen faster?
Matt: Probably.
Laura: I help him put on the armor.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (whispering) Ow ow ow! That's too tight!
Laura: Well, you're not the same size as the other guy!
Taliesin: Yeah, it's a little bit better. Ten.
Matt: Ten. As you put out your hand, Galdric snarls, and as you say, "Here, boy." (growls and snaps) It lashes out at your hand. That is going to be-- That's a 21 to hit?
Taliesin: I'll take it.
Travis: Keyleth, can't you talk to, like, plants and shit?
Matt: You take six points of piercing damage as its jaws clench down on your hand, and you tear your hand away. You can feel the warmth flowing under the glove.
Taliesin: Gently, I'm gentle with it.
Marisha: I cast Speak with Animals.
Liam: I click my Boots of Haste!
Matt: You do?
Sam: Aren't you getting dressed?
Laura: He can dress faster!
Travis: Speed change.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Quick change.
Sam: Seven-and-a-half minutes! (laughter)
Matt: You guys all become immediately aware of the creaking of leather in the distance as the two siblings are in the process of fast-changing one of the other.
Laura: The rustle of feathers.
Marisha: Okay, I cast Speak with Animals. And I crouch down to the ground. And bow down a little bit, and I say: are you the one they call Galdric?
Matt: Looks over at you for a second. The growl stops, and its posture changes a little bit. It raises its nose. (sniffs)
Marisha: Was Purvan your master?
Matt: Looking at you as you guys hear Keyleth making this series of growling sounds.
Laura: Trinket totally understands you, no?
Matt: Strangely enough, Trinket does, Trinket's like, (confused bear noise).
Taliesin: Trinket is Scooby-Doo, apparently.
Travis: Shitballs! Taint! You going that way?
Marisha: Oh my god, I get a secret!
Sam: There are several items that are sold out at the store! If you'd like to go on and see what items have already sold out, check it out. (laughs)
Laura: We need to get more t-shirts in stock.
Sam: Yeah, we know that. We know that, guys. We know.
Laura: That needs to happen. But there is still the Critical Role logo t-shirt available. What is happening? What is he--
Sam: Is there a ring or something?
Laura: Is the ring still available?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: If the ring is still available, check out our ring!
Marisha: I can respond back, right? Your master died a great champion for the Raven Queen. He has been paid a great honor, and now the Raven Queen has chosen a new master.
Laura: I push Vax forward.
Matt: You've gotten maybe part of the tunic on. (laughter)
Sam: Is he Donald-Duck-ing it right now?
Matt: Practically. There are undergarments, but not much. It's, like, bare legs and knees, part of an arm. Yeah, he got thrust out of the changing room about 20 seconds into it.
Sam: Nice.
Liam: I still walk toward the wolf.
Taliesin: Waddle.
Liam: No no no, I did the top, I did the top, c'mon!
Matt: The wolf turns his head a little bit curiously.
Marisha: I continue to speak to the wolf.
Liam: And I kneel. And bow my head.
Marisha: A great darkness has fallen upon our lands. Upon Othanzia. We could use all of the assistance that we can achieve. Would you be willing to find a new purpose? Join Vax'ildan--
Liam: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yes?
Liam: Tell him to come forward and look into my eyes.
Laura: (whispers) That's a bad idea for dogs.
Liam: Tell him.
Laura: (whispers) It's gonna bite your face off.
Marisha: Galdric. Please. Approach your new master and look into his eyes.
Laura: Give him some chocolate, man!
Matt: The wolf looks towards you, looks towards the loosely half-dressed half-elf.
Marisha: Look into his eyes. I said look into his eyes. And see the touch of the Raven Queen inside of him.
Matt: Wolf slowly stalks towards you across the stone floor. You can hear the claws of the wolf clattering against the stonework. As you can see it's partially, like, digging into the stonework with each step. It has purpose with each stride.
Liam: As it's coming, I'm taking daggers out and throwing 'em on the ground.
Matt: The wolf stops and looks up at you. Turns around and walks towards the doorway where you are.
Sam: Where who is?
Matt: Where Grog is. Grog, who's now at the door, at the exit.
Laura: (whispers) What's his name?
Taliesin: Galdric.
Marisha: Galdric.
Marisha: Galdric!
Matt: Keeps walking.
Laura: Galdric!
Sam: Going to stop him, Grog?
Travis: Well, I'm in the doorway.
Marisha: Grog, don't move. Don't move. Look at the dog. Don't move, and don't hurt the dog. Please just look at the dog.
Laura: I pull out one of my treats I have for Trinket.
Matt: Okay. Trinket starts lumbering up towards you (thudding).
Laura: Wait, wait, Trinket-- This is for your buddy Galdric. Galdric!
Matt: Just keeps walking, doesn't even look at you in the face, walks--
Laura: I throw the treat and say, hey!
Matt: It scatters across the stone. Walks between your legs and exits out.
Travis: I pivot on my back foot. I take out Craven Edge--
Taliesin: No!
Travis: No, I do, I take out Craven Edge and I sink it into the earth right beside his head. And I say, (shouts) heel!
Matt: Make an animal handling check.
Laura: Whoa, is it good, is it good?
Travis: 20.
Matt: As the sword (crack) into the rock outside of this fortress, it probably embeds itself a good foot and a half into the mountain. You guys all hear Grog's shout echo through the inside of the fortress itself, causing little bits of dust and small pebbles to dislodge from the roof, slowly fall down. The wolf has stopped and spun in its place and reached out and lashed the blade with its jaws and (cling) as it releases it.
Travis: Stay.
Matt: He sits.
Travis: That went well! (laughter)
Sam: Dog whisperer!
Travis: Good pup.
Sam: Are you its master now?
Travis: No, no, I don't think it has a master. This is a very powerful beast. But it needs a firm hand. And I think it needs a job. So. What do we plan to do with Galdric? Said his name right?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: We plan on having him help us kill some dragons?
Taliesin: I think he's a wolf. I think perhaps something a little less ambitious.
Laura: Trinket hides very well when dragons are around.
Taliesin: I think, perhaps, joining the Whitestone conclave might be a-- Having him guard Whitestone, perhaps.
Laura: Good, yeah! I like it!
Travis: I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull out one thing of dry food rations, and a probably pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain.
Liam: Where did we get that?
Travis: Oh, there's a veritable Walmart of shit in this bag. (laughter)
Travis: And I, like a hamburger patty, smash it all together.
Matt: The only reason you even know this was at one point dark elf brain matter is because that's what you willed to reach in and find. It does not at all visually match your memory of its--
Travis: Does it have a little bit of a viscous-y ooze, mostly?
Matt: Oh yeah, no, it's--
Travis: It'll soften up the dry food.
Liam: Gray Chicken McNuggets.
Matt: It'll soften up a lot of things. It's pretty terrifying.
Laura: It'll make the wolf vomit.
Travis: So I throw that on the ground, and I pour a little ale on top of it. (laughter)
Sam: Wolves love getting drunk.
Matt: Very good. It leans forward and smells it.
Travis: Yeah, no, it wasn't the best, I can do better. Okay.
Laura: Trinket goes up and starts eating it.
Travis: He's going to barf that all over the carpet later.
Liam: Forget the chocolate.
Travis: I need to carry beef in this bitch.
Taliesin: It goes bad.
Liam: We have Dork! We've got nothing of Dork left?
Laura: Oh, you know what I have, by the way? I still have, like, a cooler Bag of Holding. That we got from the Slayer's Take.
Travis: Oh! That's really good to know.
Travis: I pour into a little chalice some ale.
Laura: Like, it keeps things cold. Yeah, it's like a little bitty one, but it keeps parts from going bad.
Matt: It's nowhere near as large as a Bag of Holding, but it has a slow stasis for organic goods.
Sam: We should keep some food on hand next time!
Laura: Totally!
Travis: I offer him some ale, just to see if he even likes it. Some dogs like beer, some others don't.
Matt: Mm. Wolf doesn't seem to be interested.
Travis: Yeah, all right. Then I chug it.
Sam: So are we telling this wolf something or commanding it to come with us as we return to town?
Taliesin: I think he would be helpful to guard the town, at this point.
Laura: Well, he'll follow Grog, I suppose.
Sam: Let's go back to town and bring him with us.
Travis: All right.
Matt: You guys return to Whitestone. It's another, like, three-hour trek to find your way back down to the city. Stalks up next to you. Definitely seems to be attentive to your commands. Doesn't appear to be a bond per se, but of everyone that it's encountered so far, you're the only one that really gathered its respect.
Laura: I threw a treat at it. I don't understand.
Travis: That's a great thing to throw at a giant 400-pound bull mastiff.
Marisha: I spoke words at it. Apparently that's not good enough. Communicating.
Travis: Right, so we're walking back to town. We've got a giant fuck-off wolf with us. Vax looks like Edward Scissorhands.
Liam: I'm peeling that off as we walk.
Laura: What?
Travis: What?
Travis: No!
Laura: Leave it the fuck on!
Liam: I'm peeling it off.
Laura: It's really expensive. What, do you want to damage it?
Liam: I'm peeling it off.
Laura: (quietly) Fuck, he doesn't appreciate presents.
Matt: All right, so you take what little bit of the armor you had on, off, and are you putting your other armor back on?
Laura: He doesn't have any other armor. I took his armor.
Liam: I have regular fucking armor that I grew up in with you, you fucking shit.
Sam: Do you want to trade with me, Vax? I've got some armor you could take.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: You're a funny man.
Matt: All right, so you're back in town and you have a wolf.
Travis: Do we find a holding pen for the wolf?
Taliesin: I don't think we need to. I think we can communicate to him--
Laura: No. Tell him not to attack villagers.
Taliesin: Ask him if he'll be willing to keep the town safe.
Laura: Do it in a really aggressive way, though, Keyleth. Stern.
Marisha: Very aggressive? Okay. Okay.
Sam: We should find some food for the thing, too.
Marisha: If I turned into a dog. If I turned into a wolf, do you think he'd respect me more?
Laura: No, he'll probably attack you.
Travis: He'll mount you.
Laura: Or he'll bone you.
Taliesin: I'm not ready for that game.
Sam: Do it.
Travis: Let's be clear. (laughter)
Laura: Matt's like, "mm-mm."
Liam: Oh, you soured the DM. (laughter)
Taliesin: To be fair, that's happened before.
Laura: Yeah, I remember.
Taliesin: With the troll.
Travis: With the troll. It was so good. That was you, wasn't it?
Taliesin: No, it wasn't me. Was it you?
Sam: I don't know.
Travis: Who was getting humped on?
Taliesin: I don't remember.
Sam: Finalize this wolf so we can go kill something.
Marisha: I take my staff and I say, Galdric! I'm being assertive.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: She's the alpha.
Laura: (whispering) Grog, go stand behind her.
Marisha: You want a task? I'll give you one.
Matt: All right. How long does Speak With--
Marisha: I don't know.
Matt: It lasts for ten minutes, so you can cast it again. It's first level.
Marisha: Oh, has it not been ten minutes?
Matt: It has been more than ten minutes. It took you three hours to return.
Marisha: Okay, we walked back? Okay, I'll cast it again.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Can I cast Speak With Animals on other people? I can't, right? No.
Matt: All right, so as you shout, go ahead and make an animal handling check, with advantage because of your ability to speak.
Marisha: With advantage?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I'll take the-- what is that, 16? Plus a six, so 22.
Matt: Okay. Galdric turns to you and essentially leans towards you and you get the essence, the idea of a message across, and to keep me from having to walk behind now, at this point, as you guys have managed to make seeming amends at the moment, employs the idea of, "I'll listen if you give me a task."
Marisha: He talked back.
Laura: Have him guard the village.
Marisha: Okay. (louder) Galdric. Only a beast of your great fortitude--
Laura: Just fucking tell him to do it!
Marisha: Right, okay. Sorry. Would you like to guard--
Sam: It's a command.
Marisha: -- the town, Whitestone? (shouting) Guard this town, dog.
Travis: Keyleth, repeat after me.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: In exchange for food, protect these lands.
Marisha: Galdric. In exchange for food, shelter, and a cozy fire every once in awhile--
Travis: I didn't say that shit. I didn't say that. He's a wolf. He doesn't need those.
Marisha: Patrol these lands.
Laura: Protect these lands.
Marisha: Protect these lands.
Travis: (quietly) Holy shit.
Matt: "For how long?"
Laura: (laughs) He already asked that.
Marisha: Why does he want details? Why does the dog want--
Laura: As long as we need you to.
Travis: No, no. A great danger approaches.
Taliesin: Until the danger has passed.
Travis: You'll know it when it comes.
Marisha: (clears throat) A great danger--
Laura: Approaches!
Marisha: Approaches! A great danger approaches. Your service is required until that danger--
Taliesin: Has passed.
Marisha: Has passed! Is no longer in effect. You'll know. You'll know, because they're fucking dragons, man. You'll know. Protect--
Travis: I walk over and put my hand over Keyleth's mouth. You stay. We feed you. Is there a tavern or a butcher shop or something nearby?
Matt: There is a butcher. As you're having this thought, however, Galdric turns back over to you and says, "I can feed myself."
Laura: Yeah, you can.
Matt: "But I will watch until this danger has passed."
Laura: Awesome.
Matt: "Then am I free to go?"
Marisha: Then you are free to go.
Matt: "Very well. I grow tired of service. I wait too long." And the wolf looks at you, gives you like an acknowledgement, and then walks off into the woods.
Laura: Bye, buddy!
Marisha: Thanks, Galdric. Appreciate it, man.
Laura: Man, that's a cool-looking wolf.
Marisha: I look at Grog. How was that? Did that sound okay?
Travis: That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard. (laughter)
Taliesin: You did good, you did good.
Sam: I thought she did very well.
Marisha: Thank you. It really liked you. You should learn how to talk to animals.
Laura: What is that? What is that you have? What is that?
Taliesin: I'm holding onto the Raven's Slumber jewel at the moment.
Sam: The thing that can capture evil.
Taliesin: It's empty now, and do you know what I bet would fit in it very nicely?
Travis: Me.
Laura: And we can carry him around and then pop him out. Wait, okay, wait. Is it going to hurt him? Does it hurt him? Is it like, it's bad?
Sam: Not only does it not hurt him, he does not age or feel any pain.
Travis: A willing creature need not make a saving throw.
Taliesin: It's automatic, and no time passes.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to try it, and I'm going to try it, and just to see how he likes it. If he's okay with it.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hey, buddy, come here.
Matt: As you turn around and look, you see there's a small puddle on the ground where Trinket has vomited up. He's pushing dirt over it.
Travis: Yeah, you got to teach him to quit rummaging, that is really foul.
Laura: What was that? Trinket, what did you eat? Don't eat the puke. Do not eat the puke. Come here.
Matt: Trinket's like scraping dirt over it.
Travis: Got a carrot on your chin.
Laura: Trinket. Do you want to go for a ride? You like rides? Yeah? You want to go for one? All right, sit still. This'll be fun. I don't know how to use it.
Taliesin: Just point, yep.
Laura: I point to him with the--
Sam: You should probably say something cool.
Laura: By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you my Pokemon. (laughter)
Matt: Words be damned. It takes you an action or so to activate the crystal, but as you do, Trinket gives a confused look before Trinket's shadow seems to crawl up his legs until it forms into this circle, this dark core, roughly half the size of Trinket's form, before it shoots into the crystal.
Laura: Is he about this size, but I don't like that one, is he about this size?
Matt: A little larger than that before he goes into the crystal, but once he's in the crystal, it's small.
Laura: Oh, it's a little crystal?
Liam: Trinkachu, I choose you.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my gosh. That's really fun. Okay. How do I let him go?
Marisha: I think you-- yeah.
Laura: I release you.
Matt: Okay. As you do that, once again the same dark energy you saw earlier spills out and hits the ground in front of you, and from that dark shadow area Trinket's form emerges, standing there looking really confused.
Laura: How was it? Did it hurt? Can you talk to him? You can still talk to him. Talk to him. Ask him if it hurt.
Matt: (vomiting noises) Vomits a little bit more on the ground.
Laura: Well, that's not good.
Marisha: You know, sometimes the teleportation makes you lose your lunch.
Laura: Ask him how he's doing.
Marisha: Trinket? You all right buddy? You all right, there?
Matt: "Feeling sick."
Laura: Ask him how the little car ride was, ask him if he liked the ride.
Marisha: How was the ride? Did you feel all right? How was--?
Matt: "Yeah?"
Laura: Okay, would you mind, ask him if he'd mind doing that on occasion, you know, whenever I need him to.
Marisha: What was it like in there? Was it--?
Matt: "I don't remember."
Marisha: Okay, that's good, that's good. Would you mind--
Laura: Ask him if he cares if I do it again, ask him if he cares.
Marisha: Would you mind doing that, you know, frequently? On occasion. MATT "If she wants me to, okay."
Laura: What did he say, what did he say? He looked really cute when he said something.
Marisha: You have a lot of men who will do anything for you.
Laura: Oh, buddy! I go and hug him really tight and scratch his ears.
Matt: You do, and avoid the little bit of--
Laura: --vomit on, I don't even care! Oh my gosh, thank you! This is the best, this is the best and we can travel with him, we can climb with him, we can sneak around.
Sam: Hey, and if Trinket isn't in it, you can also use it to capture baddies.
Laura: I know, it's great!
Taliesin: And because of the way that the projection works, you could also in theory capture a baddie and then let them loose off a cliff and watch them drop.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Oh my god, you're right.
Taliesin: It's very convenient.
Laura: Oh my gosh. Okay.
Matt: So. You have a crystal, you've set a wolf on a path.
Sam: Where are we going next?
Matt: Where are you going now?
Taliesin: Your home, I imagine.
Laura: Don't we need to--oh, yeah.
Sam: What's our to-do list?
Marisha: We don't have to worry about it. We can, it's fine.
Taliesin: Fire Ashari it is.
Sam: Wait, wait, wait. What are the things that we need to do?
Laura: We need to check in on Keyleth's family.
Sam: Cobalt Reserve, Ashari.
Laura: Grog's family.
Sam: Did we already take care of Osysa's mate, Frostweald?
Laura: No, but that's down--
Taliesin: That's far.
Marisha: That's the other Vestige, correct?
Laura: Yes, that's over by Grog's family.
Matt: That's information about the Vestiges.
Sam: We need to steal an airship.
Taliesin: I agree, that's still very important.
Travis: I can't remember where, what--
Laura: They were by Kraghammer.
Travis: Thank you. I'm having terrible hiccups.
Sam: What about, we need to find Kaylie at some point. We also need to, who's gone, where's Allu-- where's Ki-- where's people?
Laura: Allura should be here in like a day. She should be here very soon.
Travis: What's close to here? (hiccups)
Taliesin: Nothing's close, we're specifically far away from everything.
Marisha: But we can go wherever we want as long as we've been there before.
Travis: Well, we should definitely go to the Fire Ashari.
Taliesin: Fire Ashari is the next--
Laura: We should go to the Fire Ashari.
Marisha: Oh god, I'm immediately nauseous.
Matt: (bear noises)
Liam: That's two of us.
Marisha: Oh, Trinket, buddy. What time is it?
Laura: (laughs) Do you need some water?
Matt: It's still, with the travel to and from, it's middle afternoon, like one o'clock in the afternoon.
Taliesin: Take it.
Sam: If we're going to go, do we need anything before we leave? We got everything we need? Potions and stuff? Want to buy some meat for your cooler?
Laura: Yeah, let's get some meat.
Matt: It's pretty easy to go ahead and procure it, five gold of meat will fill that thing.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: So go ahead and mark five gold off your paper.
Sam: How much, could I buy a medical kit somewhere?
Matt: Yeah, you could find a general store and purchase a medical kit.
Sam: How much is that?
Matt: I'm going to look that up right now.
Sam: All right, whatever, I've got it.
Taliesin: It's nifty that you have a book that tells you how much something like that costs.
Matt: Imagine that. It's like it's a handbook of some kind, it's crazy.
Marisha: Does anyone have any fire-resistant items?
Laura: He does.
Liam: I do.
Laura: Put it on.
Marisha: I might pick up some fire resistant potions as well.
Travis: I have this black iron plate that I haven't used ever. 'While wearing this heavy plate 'armor, the bearer gains resistance to any fire damage.'
Matt: Five gold for an herbalist's kit for you.
Laura: Oh, plate armor, none of us can wear it but Pike.
Matt: An herbalist's kit, like five gold.
Sam: Can that stabilize people?
Matt: If used with a medicine check, yeah.
Laura: Okay, I have this, which I can't wear.
Taliesin: What is that?
Laura: It's a purple and black robe. It was Lady Briarwood's robes.
Taliesin: What does it do?
Laura: Clings to nearby darkness as you walk. While wearing this robe, you gain resistance to piercing damage. Anybody need pierce resistance that can wear robes?
Taliesin: I'm pretty reasonable.
Sam: Do I wear robes?
Matt: Robes would be worn instead of your armor.
Sam: No thanks.
Laura: What about Gloves of Missile Snaring? That appeal to anyone?
Sam: Missile snaring? What does that do?
Laura: These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them, and when a ranged weapon attack hits you, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity modifier provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to zero, you can catch the missile if it's small enough to hold in that hand.
Taliesin: Does it require attuning?
Marisha: They're pretty sleek.
Laura: It requires two, no it just requires one free hand.
Taliesin: Yes, but does it require attuning?
Laura: Yes it does, it requires attuning.
Taliesin: I might be attuned out at this point.
Laura: Anybody? I feel like that could be cool for you, Scanlan.
Sam: I think I can take it?
Taliesin: What's your dex? Your dexterity is not very-- actually, it might work out well for me, weirdly enough.
Marisha: Are you fully attuned?
Taliesin: I can undo something that I'm not using.
Marisha: Percy, you have access here in Whitestone to alchemy supplies, correct?
Taliesin: Matt, I have access to alchemy supplies here in Whitestone, correct?
Matt: (laughs) I mean, there are elements of your initial workshop I guess, that a lot of supplies have been cannibalized but a few things can be pieced together. Plus there was a lot of alchemical elements and tools that were utilized in the subterranean tunnels as part of the refinement process for the whitestone residuum, the large vats of acid that were distilled by the Briarwoods while they were here, and there are other elements of their own tinkering in the alchemical arts that remain scattered throughout the castle. So yeah, you can definitely find enough to tinker with if you want.
Marisha: I mean, we could take the rest of the evening and I can attempt to make some fire resist potions.
Sam: Eh.
Travis: All right, here's what I'm thinking, right? I mean, if we go after my herd, we're in for a fight. A big one. If we go to your Fire Ashari, we're doing recon and hopefully learning something, right?
Marisha: Well, we're going to be in for a fight at the Fire Ashari as well because there's a giant sunder in the fire plane, and last time I checked there were fire imps and elementals pouring through there.
Travis: Are those bad?
Taliesin: Eh.
Marisha: They're annoying
Taliesin: As long as we're quick we can go about it.
Marisha: Well.
Sam: What's our mission?
Travis: You really want to get the rest of the testicles of--
Marisha: I mean, we could theoretically see if there are survivors and I can attempt to close the tear in the plane. I don't know if I can do that. However, I don't know anyone else particularly more qualified to attempt it.
Travis: Allura or that bearded dude.
Marisha: We're talking about the Fire Ashari and possibly what to do there.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: We can go and look for survivors--
Laura: And bring them here.
Marisha: And someone should probably close the tear in the fire plane.
Laura: Should we wait for Allura then, before we go?
Travis: Well, if there are survivors, they might not be that way for very long if we don't go.
Laura: They've been there for a while already.
Marisha: If there are survivors--
Laura: Then they're surviving.
Marisha: They've survived. I agree. It's not going to be pretty.
Taliesin: I know you don't want to go.
Marisha: I really don't.
Taliesin: But we need to go. I say we take the rest of the day. You make your potions, we leave first thing in the morning.
Laura: Wait for Allura, hopefully she'll be here by then.
Taliesin: Maybe Allura will join us by tomorrow morning. If not, we teleport over.
Matt: Okay, you guys are going to rest for the evening?
Travis: Wait, hold on, is there like a house of entertainment in Whitestone? I know it's just getting back on its feet but you know.
Matt: That would be a question more for Percival.
Travis: Percy? I'm having a bit of a soul struggle and I'm wondering if I might bend your ear for a moment.
Taliesin: Sure.
Travis: Yeah, could I speak to you over here?
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Travis: Right, so, like, I want to get my freak on.
Taliesin: I don't feel that way about you. (laughter)
Travis: Yeah, no, I, I'm sorry.
Taliesin: I mean, you're very attractive.
Travis: That was very unclear. So I know this is like your home and stuff and you might not have been aware of it, but they have these houses where like....
Taliesin: Oh, where you get your freak on!
Travis: Yes.
Taliesin: Yes. Yes, we have them.
Travis: Oh good, do you think they're still in order?
Taliesin: Oh, I imagine so.
Travis: Could you point me in that direction?
Taliesin: No, I have no idea where they are. I do know that they exist. I actually had things to do here. I didn't have time for these.
Travis: Oh yeah, me too, important things. I was thinking for Scanlan in case he gets bored, you know, you've got to keep him focused.
Taliesin: I wouldn't actually know where any of these places were, would I?
Matt: No, and those that did exist in this town have not been...
Taliesin: I figured as much. I'm just fucking with him. Okay. No.
Travis: Oh, okay, well, I'll let Scanlan know. Just keep it between you and me 'cause he's very sensitive about these things.
Taliesin: Your secret is safe with my indifference. That's fine.
Travis: Well, my, my, indifference
Taliesin: I know you do.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: You're wonderful.
Marisha: Can I start telling that to people in real life?
Taliesin: Yes you can. I do it all the time.
Marisha: Yes. Your secret is safe with my indifference.
Travis: Okay. I'm going to rest.
Sam: Before we set off on this, is there anything closer or more pressing? I don't actually know why we're going to her place, but I'm fine with it.
Marisha: To look for survivors and close the giant tear in the fire plane that evil, well not evil, fiery entities are pouring through.
Taliesin: It's a hellmouth, it's basically a hellmouth.
Travis: It's either that or we go goliath hunting.
Laura: That's next.
Taliesin: But this is quick, this is something that we can knock off the list.
Sam: All right, let's knock it off.
Travis: Yeah, right, let's just check it off.
Liam: As we're walking through town, do I see any weaponsmiths?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: Okay.
Taliesin: I'll help you make the potions.
Liam: 21.
Matt: Okay, that'll help cut down on the time. 21? There are two functional smiths left in the town. There were two more than that overall, that were more like blacksmithy, but they both unfortunately lost their lives in the insurrection. But there are two functional blacksmiths in this, yeah.
Liam: And one's nearby, to pass through?
Matt: About a ten-minute diversion.
Liam: I'm splitting off from the group.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: We've got to get out of here.
Liam: One's in front of me now?
Matt: Well, you find your way to-- it's a small blacksmith, and most of it's outside. Though the day is growing late, you do see an older gentleman, long, tattered grey hair pulled into a very tight bun in the back and a beard that is actually tied off to the side. Otherwise it would be hanging down into his work. He's wearing soot-covered clothes, big leather apron, leather gloves, and he's currently in the process of (ping ping) turning over and hammering out a piece of orange glowing steel.
Liam: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, I have a very simple request.
Matt: He doesn't stop. He seems to, he acknowledges your presence but he's still working as he's listening. (smithing sounds)
Liam: I have six gold burning a hole in my pocket. I'm not looking for anything simple. Do you have a short sword? A regular old shortsword.
Matt: (ting) He looks over at you. "If that's what you're looking for, on that wall over there we've got two shortswords." (ting)
Liam: What's the difference between the two that I can see?
Matt: (smithing sounds) That you can see? Make a perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: Looking over them both, from this distance, they're both made with different hilt designs and different pommel designs, the grips are a little different but other than that the blades are pretty much identical.
Liam: I grab one off the wall. I slap down six gold, which I know is way too much and say, thank you sir. Pelor lives here. And I walk away.
Matt: Okay, as you start walking away he goes, "Hey."
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: "You're going to pay proper for that shortsword."
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry. How much does it cost?
Matt: "12 gold pieces."
Liam: My apologies. 12?
Matt: "12 gold pieces, friend."
Liam: So I put down six. I put down another 14. I really apologize. I was just confused.
Matt: "It's all right. No harm no foul." Takes the gold and scoops it and puts it into his pouch. "Have a good day."
Liam: I walk down the street going like-- it's big.
Matt: It's much bigger than you're used to, but it's got a fine balance to it and it's well-made. All right, so as you guys have all--
Laura: I've got an opal dagger you could have used.
Liam: I don't need your dagger.
Taliesin: We're going to make our potions?
Matt: Yes, yes. All right, so.
Marisha: I have another question.
Matt: What is your other question?
Marisha: Before we all go to bed tonight can we get like a fuckton of the green stone under Whitestone?
Taliesin: There's really not a lot of it.
Marisha: Say like $1,000 worth and maybe have like a real nice Heroes' Feast before tomorrow?
Liam: Wise as fuck.
Laura: Or in the morning.
Liam: Heroes' Breakfast.
Marisha: I've got to do it at night, because I have to Tree Stride in the morning.
Matt: You can choose either to create the potion or to mine the residuum for the evening. You cannot do both. Both are time, like, to pull that material from the-- because most of it that remains has been already embedded within the ziggurat beneath. You would actually have to physically chip it from the structure.
Laura: I have a plan, Keyleth.
Marisha: Yes?
Laura: We will cover the 1,000 gold from our own party funds and have someone here mine some shit for us and give it to us later.
Marisha: I like that plan, yeah. Sounds good to me.
Sam: How about the wolf?
Taliesin: So potions.
Laura: Percival, do you have people here who can mine? Looking for work, people--?
Marisha: Yeah, sure, why not?
Taliesin: I'll let them know that they should start trying to pull the residuum out of the wall, but it's dangerous down there.
Laura: Yeah, it is.
Taliesin: And tampering with it is definitely...
Travis: Necessary.
Taliesin: Should be ginger. It would, I'm trying to keep everything ginger down there.
Laura: So maybe we should take 1,000 gold just from your family stores then, huh? That might be smarter.
Taliesin: We currently have 1,000 gold from my family stores that are in the group treasury at the moment.
Laura: Oh, we do. No, that's 500. That was just 500. Just so you know.
Taliesin: I feel like it was more than that.
Laura: No, it was just 500.
Liam: Hey, de Rolo, do you remember what happened yesterday?
Taliesin: He's not there.
Laura: Isn't he, though?
Taliesin: I was going to do such a nice thing for you, but never mind now.
Laura: (laughs) No, no, no, do something really nice for me.
Liam: Where did I go? Oh, I went to buy a shortsword.
Taliesin: No, never mind. You went to buy a shortsword.
Laura: Dear, dear, dear, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Do nice things. All right?
Taliesin: I'm trying to be gentle with my family right now. They're taking on an awful lot.
Laura: You're right. They're taking on so many people.
Taliesin: And we'll see what we can do.
Liam: I'd like to think you hear me in your mind.
Taliesin: Always fucking hear you in my mind.
Laura: Let's just use the damned party funds for the time being. It's fine, Keyleth. This is a really important feast.
Taliesin: We're busy making potions.
Laura: All right.
Matt: So you prepare a Heroes' Feast before you begin this potion-creation process? Is that what I understand or not?
Laura: What?
Marisha: Can I make some potions and then, like, I make dinner for us before we go to bed?
Matt: It's going to take you about the length of a day to create the potion, with his help it takes it to about half, so it'll be about 12 hours of creating. Eight to 12 hours. So.
Travis: Pick one.
Taliesin: Pick one.
Marisha: I'll do a damn feast.
Taliesin: No potion?
Matt: You can do the potion as well. The feast only takes a moment to cast.
Marisha: All right, okay. Yeah.
Matt: I'm just saying, be aware that you guys will probably have, if you want to get a full rest after that potion creation process, you're going to have to wait until like this time tomorrow, like late in the day to make your journey. Which is fine, if you're willing to be patient about it.
Travis: Sure.
Matt: Yes, no?
Travis: Say one, just say one.
Marisha: Yeah, let's do it, let's do it. Let's go in prepared and then we can always rest on that side.
Matt: Cool. For a fine, fine dinner.
Laura: Just want to make sure we feast right before we leave so that it's most useful.
Matt: All right, so. You, everyone else goes to sleep while you and Percy work tirelessly through the night. If I could have you--
Liam: Fuck!
Matt: (laughs) Just for the sake of it, I want you to go ahead and make an arcana check.
Marisha: Aw, an arcana? Do I get advantage because of my little skill in alchemy? I'm skilled in alchemy.
Matt: Yeah. Oh, that's right you are, never mind, go ahead and do that.
Matt: Proficiency bonus, are you proficient in alchemy?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So proficiency bonus, and for this, use intellect modifier.
Marisha: Okay. Intellect, which makes it plus seven. Do I have advan-- ooh, I rolled a natural 19.
Matt: Okay. We'll say, for the fair cost of, reduced due to the roll, 450 gold pieces, you create a potion of resistance of your choice of resistance.
Marisha: Just one?
Matt: Just one.
Marisha: Fire.
Matt: It takes a long time, man.
Marisha: Fire!
Matt: Fire, all right. You create a potion of fire resistance. The materials cost you 450 gold to create, you finish it by about sunrise the next day. Everyone else begins slowly waking up after the night's rest as you guys both, bags under your eyes.
Laura: Oh, that was a good night's sleep, I tell you what.
Travis: Seriously.
Sam: Keyleth, could you--
Marisha: What? Oh, god, you snuck up on me.
Sam: Could you make me some tea real quick?
Marisha: Scanlan.
Sam: What?
Marisha: Go fuck yourself.
Sam: What, you were up before me, I thought--
Taliesin: All right. All right, this is fine.
Marisha: This is fine.
Taliesin: This is good.
Marisha: This is great.
Matt: You're doing a Heroes' Feast for breakfast, then? Is that how it's working?
Marisha: I'll take a nap. I'll cook breakfast, guys, good morning. Good morning!
Laura: Oh hey, good morning, Keyleth!
Sam: Why don't you sleep during the day, we'll all take our feast, and then blast off at night time?
Marisha: Because I have to teleport and cooking this feast are both 6th-level spells and I can only do one of those a day.
Travis: Man, it's hard being a druid.
Laura: Can anybody else make a feast? That's here?
Marisha: Pike. Pike. Pike?
Sam: She's with Gilmore.
Travis: She's not here.
Laura: (sighs) I miss Pike.
Liam: We all miss Pike.
Marisha: I'll cook breakfast, guys.
Laura: No, I'll cook breakfast. No, I won't cook breakfast.
Liam: That's a good idea, for you to not cook breakfast.
Matt: What's the plan?
Marisha: I'm cooking breakfast!
Matt: Are you cooking breakfast or are you summoning breakfast? That's my question.
Laura: Are you summoning breakfast and then you're sleeping and then we're leaving?
Marisha: I'm summoning-- yes, I'm summoning breakfast and then I'm sleeping.
Laura: And then you're sleeping and then we're leaving as soon as you wake up.
Matt: Okay, that's what I was wondering. We got the answer, okay, cool. Hoo, today's been a slog. All right, so you go ahead and you use Heroes' Feast, summoning forth a fantastical breakfast meal filled with coffee and eggs and everything you would hope for, the finest materials.
Laura: Froot Loops!
Matt: (laughs) Sure, Froot Loops is on the menu, why not?
Taliesin: Lucky Charms.
Matt: No Lucky Charms, sorry, those aren't available on Tal'Dorei. But yes, all you guys take an hour to finish devouring this, you finish your meal, all you guys get a 2d10 hit point maximum increase to your hit points.
Laura: Ooh, ooh, greens, greens!
Matt: And immune to poison, frightened, and all wisdom saving throws have advantage.
Travis: Damn!
Sam: Advantage on wisdom.
Matt: Yes, the usual.
Travis: Almost broke.
Marisha: And wisdom.
Laura: And you're immune to fear, right?
Marisha: Immune to fear, poison, and what else?
Matt: And you get advantage on wisdom saving throws.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: After which, Percy and Keyleth pretty much fall asleep at the table as it vanishes and they both collapse to the ground, eggs out of the corner of their mouth. Eventually they make themselves back up to sleep and the rest of you guys peter around for the remainder of the day while they get their full rest. It now comes to, at the end of that eight-hour period of time, I'd say about three, four in the afternoon before they finally wake up. You've restored your spells.
Marisha: Yay!
Matt: And the rest of you are ready to go about your business.
Laura: Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Liam: Wait! While they're sleeping, right--
Matt: Mm-hmm?
Liam: I take Scanlan aside.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oi.
Liam: Hey, buddy.
Sam: Hey, friendo.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: What's up?
Liam: We don't talk a lot.
Sam: Well, we start to and then you leave the room, usually. (laughter)
Liam: I don't handle personal emotional confrontation very well.
Sam: It's okay. I walk away. (laughter)
Marisha: Oh, shit!
Sam: Then I come back, I feel bad.
Taliesin: No, no, that was perfect.
Liam: Where did you go?
Sam: Just kidding, just kidding.
Liam: Pull up a chair, sit down, I want to ask you something.
Sam: I'm already as low as I can go.
Liam: You're right. How do you do it?
Sam: How do I do what?
Liam: How do you do it? You're risking your life as much as anyone in this group, you're almost dying every day. You're fucking smiling all the time. How do you do it? I'm kind of asking as Liam to Sam as well, but mostly as Vax to Scanlan. How do you do it? You almost died yesterday as well. Or two days ago, fuck. Why do you do it?
Sam: Well, Vax. I don't know, I mean, I like you people, okay? Everything before this was not as good. This is better. That's why. It's very simple. You had a shitty childhood, didn't you? You and the sister?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: I think Grog had some troubles. We've all had our share of shit before we all met. Now we're together, we're a family, this is better. That's how I smile. It's better than it was before. That's it.
Liam: We're probably going to die in the next month.
Sam: Yes, but it's fun while it lasts.
Liam: All right. Thought I might--
Sam: Glean some wisdom?
Liam: Yeah, but I'm just as confused as before.
Sam: Listen, I'm older than you.
Liam: How much older?
Sam: A bit. I've seen more than you have. And it's all shitty, so it just depends on how you look at it. You can dwell on the shit, or you can just leave it behind in people's beds and keep going.
Marisha: Oh god, that works on too many levels.
Taliesin: Oh god, that's too deep.
Marisha: Too deep.
Liam: You did that. Water under the bridge.
Sam: I walk away.
Liam: That little motherfucker shit in my bed.
Matt: All right. As you regather your will, path chosen; Keyleth, do you wish to prepare the transportation spell?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Let's do this.
Matt: All right. All of you gather and find your way down to the Sun Tree in the center of the town. At this point, it's later afternoon, you've been growing accustomed these past few days of taking action right around dusk, and as the sky turns from a blue to a bit of an orangish hue, you all find yourselves ready to transition back over to the continent of Issylra.
Marisha: Let's go. To the Sun Tree.
Matt: Keyleth steps forward, touches her hand to the Sun Tree, completes her mental incantation, and you watch the trunk once again tear open into the somewhat oval walkway into the tree itself. On the opposite side, what's your destination?
Marisha: Oh, god. As close as I can get to the Fire Ashari, I guess.
Matt: Okay. You recall, passing through, there were a number of trees towards the base of the mountain that were starting to grow petrified from the proximity to the ash that constantly falls from the sky. They died a long time ago and are slowly beginning to petrify. As the portal opens up on the opposite side, you can see beyond that the dark rock that formulates that mountain range. At the same time, you can see a dull orange glow, and you all begin to step through in rapid succession, Trinket racing up after Vex. All of you find yourself stepping out the other side, at which point you look up and you can see the pathway that you took towards the top of the mountain where the Fire Ashari called Pyrah, where they maintained their ever-vigilant watch on the tear into the fire elemental plane. What you do notice immediately is that the path that you took initially is no longer a simple walkway. Against the now very dark sky, this side of the realm itself, night is, actually, no, sorry. At this point, you've actually beaten the sun.
Marisha: Oh, do we gain a few hours?
Matt: Yeah, you guys have gained a few hours, technically.
Marisha: Awesome.
Matt: So it's still light in the sky from other parts in the distance, however, there is a perpetual dark cloud of smoke and actual storm cloud gathering across this mountain range. As you recall the first time you were here, that's the nature of Pyrah, it's always under this thick, heavy, soot-and-ash-filled cloud cover. The pathway that winds up the mountain, though, is instead a glowing orange mass of slowly dribbling molten rock that has filled that entire walkway, and it has come to rest at the base of the mountain where it has gathered and begun to cool. You guys are hundreds of feet off from this point as you step out of the tree. However, where you see the molten rock has reached the base of the mountain, you-- it's cooled and formed into solid rock at its base, and you start seeing flashes of the orange turning dark, then another section turns dark from the opposite side. And then a few moments pass and you can see the orange of the next section, up in like ten-foot segments, it's going dark and hardening on its own. You get the sense that your arrival did not trigger this more than it has been happening since before you arrived.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check to figure out what's up?
Matt: Sure. Actually, this would be a perception check to see if you can ascertain.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: 16. It's difficult to make out at this distance, but you can see, along portions of the jagged mountainside, a collection of small figures that are making their way up the mountain, and their slow ascent is met with the lava flow cooling in sections.
Marisha: Do they look like people, like humanoids?
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance, they look human-ish, humanoid-ish.
Taliesin: I attempt to use the optics on my gun to get a better look at them.
Matt: Sure, go ahead and make a perception check.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18. A little bit of a clearer look through, they do appear to be humanoid. You do see two arms, two legs. You can't gauge size comparison from this distance.
Sam: How far?
Matt: At this point, they're probably a good 800 feet up the mountain.
Marisha: 800 feet?
Taliesin: Are they dressed like the Ashari that I've met?
Matt: From what you can make out, their color palette shifts, there are reds and browns, some stand out as an aquamarine white. The Ashari you saw were a pretty consistent color palette. This is a little more varied.
Taliesin: I don't know who these people are.
Marisha: They could still be Ashari. Just in their elemental forms. Are there any birds around? I look up, do I see birds in the sky?
Matt: There are no birds in the sky. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this area, especially as the oppressive fumes and dust continue to pour off from the top of the caldera of this mountain range, it has made it not fitting for any sort of aerial life that you're used to seeing. You glance around for about a minute or two and you don't see any sort of bird life in the air.
Travis: Did the ground cool where they were walking? Could we follow them up?
Taliesin: We should.
Marisha: Let's stay far behind. Let's go quietly.
Laura: Let's walk. Stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: Okay. Everyone make a stealth check, including Trinket.
Travis: You don't want to put him in the thing?
Sam: You could.
Laura: (gasps) Okay.
Liam: Try it out.
Laura: I put it on a string so I could put it around my neck because it's a necklace because it's cooler that way.
Matt: Well, it has a chain on it that it came with.
Laura: It's got a chain on it, so it's around my neck.
Matt: All right, so you take it, you put--
Sam: It has a chain and a string now.
Matt: Chain and string.
Marisha: The string's so you don't forget.
Matt: Exactly. You trigger the necklace, pointing it in the direction of Trinket, and once again Trinket is absorbed into the crystal, vanishing within the inside. All right.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17.
Sam: Pass Without a Trace is--?
Travis: Plus ten. I rolled shitty.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 35.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 29.
Sam: 25.
Matt: Okay. You guys begin making your trek up. How are you going up the mountain? Are you scaling the cooled flow?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: That's probably the safest route given the fact that most of the other side of the mountain range itself is pretty jagged, and elements of it, because of the formation of this giant volcanic caldera, there are portions of broken stone and obsidian glass that sticks out the side.
Marisha: As we're walking up, I fall behind and I slip Vax the potion of fire protection.
Matt: All right. You guys continue in pace with this, eventually, and make another perception check?
Marisha: Much better, that's a natural 19. 30.
Matt: 30. Okay. Looking up, as this cluster of individuals makes their way towards the very top of the mountain, seemingly not taking sight of your traveling group, you're beginning to see the nature of each section of this flow cooling. And what you're seeing is the group will move up a bit, stop, and there appears to be a burst of-- sometimes it looks like very strong wind, sometimes it looks like a very localized sleet storm that is brought against the side of the mountain and is actually forcefully cooling the flow down temporarily, at least in those sections, before it begins to spill over and continue its slow molten descent, but they're doing their best to continue to force it back up the mountain and--
Laura: Those are druids.
Marisha: Those are druids.
Marisha: I cast Skywrite in the clouds above us, in the smoke.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I write--
Laura: "So, how are you guys doing up there?"
Taliesin: "Hi."
Marisha: "Hi. Hey you guys." I write, in druidic symbols, "Keyleth, Kaitiaki."
Sam: What's that? Is that her?
Matt: Okay. You notice the pace in which this group has ascended comes to a halt at the very, very top of the mountain range where it ends, and there's a slight pause before the clouds shift a second time and it says, from what you understand, "Kaitiaki. Survivors remain, Keyleth."
Marisha: And I respond with, "Help has arrived."
Sam: You guys are texting?
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah.
Matt: Druid texting.
Laura: What are you saying?
Taliesin: Stop looking at your phone.
Laura: What do they say?
Sam: Why don't we go over there and talk to them?
Marisha: They're survivors.
Travis: Well, let's go.
Laura: Are they nice?
Marisha: They're survivors. What does it matter?
Travis: And we go.
Marisha: Let's go. And I tell them, you know, "Arriving. Stand down. Here we come."
Taliesin: "Lol."
Marisha: "Lol. Winky-face."
Liam: As we travel, because I was too out of it to respond and she's way ahead, I take the potion that Keyleth gave to me, because she didn't have to, I've got the David Bowie armor on now.
Matt: You did don it. Okay.
Liam: Yes, yeah. Before going to bed.
Marisha: Oh you did, okay.
Liam: And I press it into Vex's hand.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hey, I took your, all right, I'm going to take it.
Matt: What was your choice of resistance? I assume it was fire. Okay. All right. As you guys progress up, and it is, though it is a safe route, it is still a relatively steep incline and you're all having to work together to find handholds, and it is very arduous physically getting up there. I would like everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Laura: A constitution?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Oh, do we get advantage because of the feast?
Travis: No, that's only wisdom.
Laura: Shit.
Liam: Come on, Colville meteorite die.
Travis: 17.
Liam: I'm so weak.
Laura: Come on, jade.
Liam: Natural 20!
Laura: You motherfucker!
Liam: Thank you, Matthew Colville.
Laura: I'm rolling my giant jade dice, because it's green.
Travis: Way to announce it.
Laura: Womp-womp. Oh, that's a six.
Travis: (laughs) You're fucked.
Marisha: 20.
Taliesin: 13.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Okay. As you guys begin to get partially up the mountain, the proximity of the heat from the-- because the exterior of the rock has cooled, but it's still molten beneath and there are parts of that are still cracking open, and bits of the heat are still pouring through, plus the general physical exertion from the not-very-hardy physiques of both Vex and Scanlan, you both suffer one level of exhaustion from the ascent up the side of this mountain.
Laura: Oh, Trinket's in his thing, he's not worried at all.
Taliesin: I don't actually know what one level of exhaustion is.
Matt: You guys have disadvantage on ability checks. All your skill checks right now, until your next long rest, are at disadvantage.
Travis: Levels of exhaustion suck.
Sam: Not saving.
Matt: However, as you guys are approaching towards the top, you can see now the humanoids that were at the top of this mountain crest have been since keeping the flow at bay and each time it begins to crest over again and continue its flow, it's blasted again from the side and cools and it's building this very, very slow gradual outcropping--
Marisha: I use my cantrip Gust and cool areas alongside as we ascend.
Matt: Okay. You glance up and you now have a better view of this group, and what you do see ahead of you, specifically Keyleth, appears to be a cluster of about eight or so Fire Ashari-dressed individuals. You can't make out their physical details yet. Along with five other entities that are dressed in the colors and vestments of those from Zephrah.
Marisha: Oh shit!
Travis: From who? From what?
Liam: What's the matter?
Laura: What's up? What's happening?
Marisha: I run up.
Matt: Keyleth goes running up.
Marisha: You said seven or eight from Zephrah?
Matt: There are five from Zephrah.
Laura: Are we going to, we're going to follow?
Liam: Yeah, I'm breaking out of stealth and running.
Taliesin: Ah. Yeah. No. We're running now.
Laura: I walk. I'm pretty tired. You and me. Let's just walk.
Sam: Yeah. You can carry me.
Taliesin: Cardio. God.
Matt: Okay, it takes a while to get up there. As you guys begin to approach, a little bit behind Keyleth, and you look, you see the only two notable Fire Ashari that you see there are Nastoen, which is a human female that you saw was one of the four that first greeted you as you approached Pyrah when you got to the mountaintop. She looks a little rough, but she's definitely in one piece. The other one that greets you, and immediately you recognize as Flamespeaker Cerkonos, who currently does not have his right arm. It is charred and is, through some semblance of flame, cauterized to where he no longer has a shoulder and part of his torso is a black mass of burnt skin, probably intentionally, but as you approach he puts his hand out and goes, "Hail, Keyleth."
Marisha: Hail, Cerkonos. And I run up and give him a hug.
Matt: He pats you on the back and there's a coldness to his look, his expression. You can see in a brief instant, though there is strength and determination, there is a moment as he looks into your face that you can see the sorrow of losing most of his people.
Marisha: And I look back at him and I say  I'm so sorry.
Matt: "This is not your fault. We had this coming. We are the able-bodied few you see."
Marisha: Are these all that have survived?
Matt: "We are 25 living. The rest reside at the base of the mountain, to be watched, or are the watchers. But our attrition is of our own making. We helped outsiders too long ago."
Marisha: What? What do you mean, like, how long ago? 12, 15 years?
Matt: "We helped seal a drake in this rift."
Laura: Thordak.
Matt: "That is the name they call him. We helped bring and bind the beast to this rift, sealing within it the heart of a primordial flame, one of the few pure essence crystals of our plane. Such a binding will not allow it to leave. It is a punishment for the most terrible of evils that the Ashari take under their order. We carved from the crystal in bind. This beast was too strong and took the entire crystal, but it seemed enough. It seemed enough."
Marisha: Cerkonos, it's not your fault. There are greater forces at work here, beyond us. That's something that I am desperately trying to reassure myself of every day.
Matt: And a voice comes up from over the mountain range, raspy, older, and with a casual importance to it, and it says, "So, are you claiming some semblance of dealing with this?" And as it steps over, the face looks down with recognition. "My god. Keyleth."
Marisha: Who are you?
Matt: You guys look up and you see long, silver-haired half-elf in later years dressed in the blue and white robes of the Air Ashari. You see before you Korren, your father. "You live."
Marisha: Dad!
Matt: He steps forward and goes in, as he steps away from Cerkonos, takes you in his arms and holds you extremely tight against him.
Marisha: I'm sorry I didn't check in sooner. I didn't want you to be disappointed.
Matt: "Shh." He puts his finger up to your lips, holds you back and looks you over and with a smile on his face, you can see the hardness of his expression fade. "Keyleth, you've grown."
Marisha: A lot's happened.
Matt: "You look just like her."
Marisha: I haven't found Mom.
Matt: "Her path was her own. I'm just glad that you have maintained yours." He wipes the tear from your face and says, "How goes the Aramente?"
Marisha: Well.
Laura: She's kicking ass.
Matt: "Good. Good." And he places his thumb at the corner of his eye. "We were called naught but a day ago by the surviving Pyrah. Told of the angry mountain and the terrible drake that sundered the rift. I helmed the team while the majority of our people stayed to keep Zephrah cloaked and safe from the marauding beast. We've only just made our way up the mountain. Your arrival is quite fortuitous, as we need all the help we can get."
Sam: How can we be of assistance?
Matt: "Come. See what remains of Pyrah." He turns around and walks back over towards the top of the mountain.
Marisha: Daddy.
Matt: He stops. Looks over his shoulder towards you. "Yes?"
Marisha: It's good to see you again, father.
Matt: "It's good to see you as well, daughter. Now come. Show me what you've learned." Goes back to walking. The rest of the Fire Ashari stand up, acknowledge and recognize those of you that stand here before, visiting once before. Cerkonos looks about. "You show strength and honor by coming here in our time of need. This will not be forgotten. Now come." As you follow them up over the top of the mountain, you see once again before you the caldera of this once-volcanic mountain has been blown apart in areas. You can see sections of large black stone that are now pushed up into jagged obelisks where once was a relatively smooth blackened shale countryside. You can see there are pits of molten rock that have been punched through the floor and have gathered into these pools where the air above is slowly shifting and warped by the heat that is now released above the mountaintop. The flow of lava that descends down the side of this mountain continues and swells and heads inward towards the Cindergrove. The Cindergrove, from what you can see from this distance, is but a fraction of what was once there, most of the trees now torn apart and scattered amongst the top of this mountain. You can see bits and pieces of the various petrified trees thrown hundreds of feet from the center. There are still standing, defiant trees amongst what once was the Cindergrove, but they are very sparse, many of them now blackened by what you can see in the very distance beyond the broken huts and homes that once held the Pyrah, you can see in the distance moving, glowing dots of various elemental energies spiraling outward from a very large central red rift that sits there pulsing and pulsing with bright, almost sunlight energy. It's like staring into the sun at the very zenith of its movement. You have to avert your eyes even staring towards this rift, now a good 30, 40 feet taller than it was when you last returned here. What was once the portal in the ground has now ruptured and is emerging, slowly piercing out of the top of this mountain. Undaunted, your father and the other Ashari continue walking forward with no words.
Laura: I rush forward a little bit to talk to him. Question. Your majesty? I want to help, we all want to help as much as possible, but I don't know any magic. Most of us don't. Are we going to be able to do anything?
Matt: "Well, I certainly hope so. If you've survived this long with my daughter, you've picked up a few tricks."
Laura: Well, that I have.
Marisha: Father, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for these people. They are the most capable that I know.
Matt: "This is good. Because that's who we need right now."
Marisha: However, since we're druids, we're a little bit more, you know. Geared. Prepared to deal with the fire. I can cast Protection from Energy on a couple of these people, if you wouldn't mind maybe grabbing the other two?
Matt: "I will do what I can."
Marisha: And I cast Protection from Fire on Percy, you have it, you have it, do you have it?
Travis: Well, I really don't even know what I'm going to do here.
Marisha: Well, it's going to protect you from fire.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: Scanlan?
Sam: Hit me, babe.
Marisha: I'll do Percy and Scanlan. Father, can you--?
Matt: It's a concentration spell, so you can only really have one person going, and that's your concentration.
Marisha: Can only have one person going.
Matt: Yep.
Travis: Well, good.
Marisha: I could cast it at higher levels. Can I cast it at higher levels?
Travis: I'll take a mulligan on this one.
Marisha: Can't do that with this one? Fuck.
Laura: Do Scanlan. Do Scanlan.
Sam: No, I'm fine, don't worry about me.
Marisha: Well, I'm going to cast it on myself, for starters. Because I want it.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: So I'm going to cast Protection from Fire on myself.
Laura: What does a potion of fire resistance do?
Liam: Halves.
Laura: The same thing?
Laura: Halves all fire damage?
Marisha: Halves all fire damage?
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right. As the cluster of you begin stepping deeper into the caldera, you begin to approach the outskirts of the remnants of the Pyrah tribe's homestead. You can see where most of it has been either completely burnt to a cinder or lies tattered by some great force, shattered. And you start, as you're walking through, you can see where the landscape itself, all the jagged bits of black obsidian glass are shooting up out of the ground and there's broken pieces of the dark rock and volcanic material, and it isn't until your eyes begin to focus that you realize that elements of this rock is not rock at all but the twisted and charred remains of the Pyrah that didn't escape in time, blending in with the ground and landscape surrounding. The rest of the Ashari continue pushing forward, not taking notice, focused, as before you, you can see the rift, still blinking ever-bright, in the center of the remains of the Cindergrove. You steel yourselves.
Marisha: I turn and I look at them and nod and follow in my people's footsteps.
Matt: And that's where we'll end tonight's session.
Travis: Oh shit.
Laura: Oh shit.
Travis: Okay. We're cooking with gas now.
Laura: As Marisha collapses in a pool of tears.
Taliesin: Cry more, cry more!
Matt: You knew this was coming.
Laura: Yeah, man. You're going to have a headache tomorrow, dude.
Marisha: I'm so tired. I'm tired.
Laura: Aw, we've got exhaustion, Sam. That's balls.
Sam: Yeah, that's not great.
Liam: Thanks for tuning in to Therapy Thursday, everyone.
Travis: Where we take shits and talk to swords.
Laura: There you go.
Matt: Got a little bit of column A, little bit of column B, we got some drama, we got some personal issues, we got some reunions, we got some hardships, we got--
Taliesin: Wild animals.
Laura: Yeah, so many things!
Matt: And a travel method for Trinket.
Laura: Oh my god, I'm so excited about it!
Matt: I wasn't sure how you guys were going to use that one, as soon as you mentioned it I was like, all right, that's what they're doing. That's a way to do it. Yeah. Well cool, guys, we'll be back next week Thursday with Chris Hardwick, who will be joining us as a guest.
Laura: Yay!
Marisha: How is he going to be here?
Taliesin: As himself. He's going to be playing himself, it's going to be very exciting.
Travis: Guys, I'm a human. Usually.
Liam: I'm super busy, I'm super busy.
Taliesin: Out of the rift suddenly comes Chris Hardwick.
Marisha: Super busy, but I'm super successful.
Liam: I'll help save the world, but I got like 50 things on my schedule.
Matt: Yeah, so we'll be back then. I think April 21st is going to be our 50th episode. We're going to be doing a fun little evening there. We'll have Critmas coming up, probably end up being that night, maybe another night that week, we'll have details coming up soon, we're trying to figure out the schedule on that. This'll be our big 50th anniversary Critmas blowout, and then we're going to scale it back to like an annual-type event it looks like, both to save the people who work this channel Thursday nights and stay super later to get here, to save the length of the episodes, and to help all of us who have to then go to work sometimes very early the next morning.
Liam: We love you, but I need to sleep. It's as simple as that. We love you, and we love Critmas, but it's a health thing.
Matt: So what we'll be doing is this will be our big blowout Critmas, we'll still do it probably for the holidays, and we really implore you guys to give to charities, send us stuff, we still read them, we'll still do Periscopes, those of us who get gifts, some of us will open them on Periscope for you, so we'll still have the interaction, we'll have to do it on our own time and not at 11, midnight.
Travis: 12, 12 30.
Liam: 12 37.
Taliesin: On a 7AM call.
Matt: So this'll be our big general blowout. So if you're planning something for the next Critmas, this'll be the one to get it in for. But yeah, you can check out the guide to Critmas on Geek & Sundry, it has a list of all our supported charities if you want to give there. It's highly recommended. Thank you guys so much for those who donated to 826 tonight so we can go ahead and help out the Seattle branch.
Marisha: 826 Seattle! We love you.
Matt: And yeah. Do we have anything else?
All: Happy St. Patty's Day.
Laura: You guys are hopefully sitting at home being very good.
Liam: For fuck's sake, take an Uber.
Matt: All right, guys. Well, have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Bye!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons, roll dice, and stuff. Tonight is a special episode; it's a special 50th episode. We've made 50 of these! To kick off the evening's festivities before the game, we want to show our first big present to you guys, something we've been working on for about a little over a month. We hope you guys enjoy it. Let's go ahead and have a look at the new full intro for Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back, guys! (cheering)
Matt: That was fun! We've been silently working on that for a long time.
Marisha: It was so hard to keep secret.
Matt: I know. Every edit that came in was awesome. Yeah, we all went together in Simi Valley for a day and shot, and did wonderful photos, which we actually have wallpaper going up tonight!
Laura: That is correct. It'll be going up very soon.
Marisha: I guess I could go right--
Laura: Do it now, he just said it!
Liam: We're doing it live! We're doing it live.
Sam: We're releasing a special 50th episode wallpaper all for you guys to use on your home PCs.
Marisha: On the Critical Role Twitter and Facebook right now.
Sam: Download it!
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: Download it, @criticalrole.
Liam: Good, pressure's off.
Marisha: It's done.
Matt: It's all over. Episode's over. No, thank you guys for coming tonight. Hope you enjoyed that. We have some really awesome people that helped out with that. I'm going to go ahead and get some thank-yous here. We have, first off, a big thank you to Jan-Michael Losada, our DP for that shoot; Pamela Joy who did all the incredible photography, and Loretta Richert, both of them helped us find and secure the location and shot an incredible series of photos that we'll be using in upcoming episode releases and promotional stuff! So check that out. You guys have been amazing, thank you so much. Next up, I want to go ahead and thank Dave and James Codeglia who are from Ghostlight. They did all the special effects you see as well as the color grading and the editing. They did a phenomenal job on this, and big thanks to you guys. It's far more than I ever expected it could be. Ghostlight is awesome.
Travis: Are we cutting to that title camera so they can see the addresses?
Matt: Yeah. For makeup we want to thank Misti Dawn, Talor Bianca Appice, and Heather Galipo, they did an amazing job. And Travis, of course, for sitting in the makeup chair for a long time.
Travis: It was cold (laughs). It was real cold.
Marisha: Four hours! Specifically, Misti did a lot of our beauty makeup, Bianca did Travis, and Heather did all of our ears. Because ears take a lot of time!
Matt: You guys did an amazing job. Next up, for our illustrious costumers, we have Jessica Dru, who did an amazing job, Jessica Dru Johnson for selling me the costumes, Vanessa Walton, who made your wonderful headpiece--
Marisha: Yes, and she has an Etsy store, actually Creature of Habit on Etsy. So follow her on Instagram and of course you can go-- she makes all these amazing flower crowns; she's basically a real-life faerie.
Taliesin: It's a magical Instagram.
Marisha: It is a magical Instagram, Creature of Habit.
Matt: Check that out. And of course Bryan Forrest for both applying a lot of the armor to Pike and a lot of individuals here. He brought a lot of the great costume pieces and armor, and was one of our illustrious goblins; he got killed as two different goblins! Took two arrows, one in the face, one in the chest. A great stuntman, Bryan, thank you so much for helping out with that.
Marisha: Thank you Bryan, we love you!
Matt: Jon Enge who was our special effects supervisor on set and was the goblin who got stabbed in the back. He was amazing.
Marisha: And he's got a youtube channel, Mars Rising, which is great. And I did a Splinter Cell guards sketch that I did with him a while ago
Taliesin: He and I used to perform at the Ren Faire together, it was a thing.
Marisha: Oh! That's awesome; Jon's awesome. Go check his stuff out.
Liam: You worked at Ren Faire?
Taliesin: Oh, shut up. Suck it.
Travis: Lord Taliesin!
Matt: Of course, Jason Charles Miller, who's a friend of the show, who's been on the show as Garthok the half-orc rogue, did the new theme, as well as the old one, but he re-upped for the new theme, extending it and making it that much more epic. Thank you so much. And Geoff Bisente did a lot of the sound design on it as well. You guys kicked ass on making it sound as good as it did. Check out their stuff, they're amazing. I think Jason should have the actual new song up on iTunes soon in case you want it for a ringtone or something. And last but certainly not least, we have Avery Faeth, who did the amazing Percy costume.
Taliesin: My coat! She's an amazing coat designer. She's got a--
Marisha: She's a coat designer.
Taliesin: She did the coat, she's an amazing cosplayer and costume designer and you can find her on Sickhorse all over the place.
Matt: And Kai Norman, who you've seen on the show, he actually did our casts of the K'Varn horn, and his incredible work. He did Percy's gun. He did a number of the props we used for it, he's great. You can find him at @KommissarProps. Additional costuming done by Anne Valiant, who did an amazing job helping us out getting the costume pieces we needed for it. As well, a big shout-out to Labyrinth of Jared at Masquerade Ball who also helped provide a lot of the costumes for the shoot, and Sword and the Stone who helped provide a lot of the weaponry and armor, along with Bryan. So thank you guys, all of you so much, for helping make this happen. We're really excited and we hope you liked it!
Travis: Can you put the first one up again, because we didn't get the Pamela Joy title-- yeah. It's the only one we missed. They were so instrumental and did such a lovely job.
Laura: Yeah they did!
Marisha: And Pam did the photo of the wallpaper.
Laura: She's actually shot all of our photos from the very beginning. She's freaking amazing.
Travis: We have so much, you guys, so much.
Marisha: Go follow her on Instagram! She's great.
Matt: All right. So getting into our actual announcements here, try and cruise through this as fast as possible.
Sam: It's our special episode; I thought everyone was dressing up.
Laura: We're all wearing our shirts
Marisha: You're appropriate for Scanlan.
Sam: You all look like shit!
Liam: Sam, can I show you my snake? (oohing and aahing)
Travis: Bigger than I thought it'd be!
Matt: Strangely, he lost it for a few sessions.
Liam: This too shall pass.
Matt: All right, so  50th episode, guys! (cheering)
Matt: Can't believe we made it this far! And more to come. 50 more! Hopefully.
Liam: Hey look! Ashley's here!
Ashley: Hey! I just landed. Not landed in a plane, but just drove in.
Matt: Drove all across the country, from New York.
Ashley: From, yes. Drove in from New York.
Laura: So what does that mean, Ashley?
Ashley: I'm here for a little while. (cheering)
Marisha: She's back!
Ashley: I'm back for a little bit.
Travis: Yay, Pike!
Ashley: Probably for a couple months, a few months, we'll see. We're pushing it for a few months.
Marisha: That sounds better.
Ashley: I'm excited and I'm nervous, but I'm excited.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: I'm so glad you could join us, and welcome back, Ashley.
Ashley: Thanks. Thank you.
Matt: Also tonight we're putting up for the next two weeks on pre-order a brand new set of "How Do You Want To Do This" hoodies, which I'm wearing here.
Laura: It's Alternative Apparel and it's super-duper-super-duper cozy inside.
Travis: Look at that! Look at that.
Ashley: That's so softy-puffy.
Marisha: They're super soft.
Laura: You could use it as a pillow, you could use it as a hoodie.
Ashley: You could wear it on a plane.
Sam: Where are all the other places they could wear it?
Ashley: On a train.
Laura: Dinner, you could wear it to dinner.
Taliesin: You could wear it in a boat!
Sam: With a goat?
Taliesin: You could put it on a goat.
Marisha: To Big Lots.
Taliesin: At work or on the go.
Liam: Keep this going all night long.
Matt: Two hours.
Sam: It's this content that you've demanded. (laughter)
Matt: So yeah, these are up on the store, or should be, and will be up for pre-order for the next two weeks. If you want one, get one! Because they're cool. I like them.
Travis: Yeah, we all have one.
Matt: Indeed. All right, next up, Critmas is tonight. So we got that coming up after the show.
Laura: Just a few packages.
Marisha: Yeah, just a few cartloads
Matt: We're going to do our best to keep it as organized and as expedient as possible so we can get to bed at a decent hour, especially those of us who have like 8:00am call times in the morning. Travis.
Travis: I'm going to stay as long as I can.
Matt: (laughs) But yeah, so stick around for that. You get to watch us all cry forever, because that's what happens every time.
Travis: Cry forever.
Matt: A couple other announcements  has here on the list "posters."
Travis: Posters?
Liam: Posters?
Sam: Posters?
Matt: Posters. Somebody must've put that on the list.
Liam: Maybe later.
Sam: What's a poster?
Liam: There's four of them on a bed.
Matt: There you go, that makes sense.
Taliesin: If somebody says they're one thing but really they're just not all that.
Matt: That makes sense. Quick announcement, an event coming up: a convention on May 26 to 29 in Atlanta called MomoCon. I will be a guest at that, so all you east coast folks around Atlanta come say hello! I have panels, and talks, and autographs to give, and cool artwork you can pick up. So yeah, MomoCon, May 26-29, hope to see you guys there. Me and Marisha are both announced to be guests at the Haven Expo in Mackay, Australia on July 2nd, so all you folks in the outback, you'll want to come hang out with me and Marisha at the beginning of July.
Ashley: (Australian accent) In the outback!
Matt: Just like that.
Ashley: (accented) Going to get a bloomin' onion?
Matt: I'm so sorry.
Laura: I'm sure they're really thrilled about that.
Matt: She's back for ten minutes, guys.
Ashley: I know a lot of Australians.
Sam: You've already offended an entire continent.
Matt: You and Johnny Depp in the same week, come on. So yeah, hopefully we're looking forward to seeing a bunch of you guys down under at the beginning of July. Let's see, reveal secret Scientology message and ascend to Xenu, that's on the list. We got that one situated.
Taliesin: Who put this one together?
Matt: Rat Queens! The next Rat Queens issue coming up. 16, I guess? Issue 16 is the number? Has a series of pages in which all of Vox Machina have a wonderful cameo.
Sam: It's amazing. We're in a comic book. We did it.
Taliesin: Has that not publicly been seen yet, is that not out yet?
Sam: Some pictures have been, but not all of it.
Marisha: We have transcended, you guys.
Taliesin: We are fiction now.
Ashley: That's so crazy.
Matt: Yeah. Isn't it? One more thing I want to mention: a really great game called Masquerada; I play the lead character, Cicero Gavar. It's been developed by a great studio named Witching Hour. They put up a Kickstarter today to see if they can make the game as good as it possibly can be-- that final push. As an independent/indie studio and an indie product, they're putting out a phenomenal isometric RPG. Great voice talent that includes Jennifer Hale, Dave Fennoy, it's a great cast. Check it out on Kickstarter if it's something you think you'd be interested in, and possibly helping them polish it and make it phenomenal. So check that out. Anything else you guys want to announce?
Liam: Yeah! Can I get a CritRole?
All: CritRole!
Liam: Boy, I always love sitting at the table with my dice and having a nice cozy wooden box to keep my dice in. Wyrmwood Gaming makes all kinds of wooden boxes to hold your dice in. We have them here, we have all kinds. There's these, there's these-- they hold dice!
Sam: Those seem really remarkable, Liam.
Ashley: Wait, what is this one?
Sam: Is there anything any bigger?
Liam: In due time.
Liam: Wyrmwood Gaming, you know them already because we talk about them non-stop, friend of the show. If you use the code CritRole, you'll get free shipping. Also Wyrmwood Gaming has a kickstarter up this month for their Sentinel box, which holds--
All: Ooh!
Ashley: What is this?
Liam: It holds your cards, it holds your dice, there's a bluetooth doohickey in it so you'll never lose your box with dice and cards. And you can get all kinds of woods, there's all kinds of tiers, you can get the Critical Role logo etched into any kind of box that they have. And if you want to go full wizard you can get the shnazzy Masterworks box, did I get that right?
Laura: It is masterworks.
Ashley: I want that one!
Travis: I think that's one of the Vestiges.
Liam: So, check it out. Wyrmwood Gaming, they got a Kickstarter, they got a website. They're our good buddies.
Matt: All right. So, anything else anyone wants to talk about or mention?
Marisha: I mean.
Matt: Because if not, I think we may have to watch that intro again. (cheering)
Travis: Yeah, yeah, do it again! Do that shit again, please!
Matt: Let's watch that intro again. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. I remember writing the script for that and going, "We're going to have to cut all this." And then we didn't. I'm so happy how it turned out.
Marisha: Mainly because we ran out of time.
Matt: Like, "Well, we got to do it. Make it work."
Taliesin: "There's no time to do anything else, other than this."
Matt: "We can't cut the tentacle creature. I don't know how we'll do it, but it's in there." Let's go ahead and bring us back into the realm of Exandria and catch us up to what happened last time. Vox Machina, a group of adventurers currently on the path to try and usurp and destroy the Chroma Conclave, a collection of chromatic dragons that have torn through Tal'Dorei and currently reign supreme over the partially ruined cities that dot the landscape. The largest of them, and apparently the leader, Thordak the Cinder King sitting in the main city of Emon, forcing you guys to flee. You've gone about and discovered these artifacts, these legendary items known as the Vestiges of Divergence. Ancient magical weapons and equipment from the last great war, the Divergence. And these seem to be a key in which you can ascertain a level of power and a means of destroying these creatures. Upon seeking information about these, you traveled south to the Frostweald, where you battled a camp of orcs, freeing survivors from Westruun's attack, and managed to walk your way into the deep den of a forgotten Ioun temple where Osysa, the sphinx's mate, resides. After traversing past traps and puzzles you made your way to the main chamber in which the nameless sphinx demanded you reveal that you have earned its name. During this battle you traveled through portals to other elemental realms to seek out the information to hopefully devise the title of this sphinx before it was too late. During which, Grog leapt through, if I recall, one of these portals into the Elemental Plane of Air. Set adrift without a means of returning, he took his Chain of Returning, attached it to Craven Edge, and threw it through the portal. It found purchase and you pulled yourself through, face-to-face with Pike, with the blade embedded in her abdomen. The weapon, which had achieved its maximum strength potential of devouring the essence of others, transformed during this battle and has been in its rather intense and dangerous form since. You guys managed to piece together the name of this sphinx, at which point the battle ended and it presented to you the information you required. It gave you the information of the Vestiges that still exist, to its knowledge, and you were escorted via immediate sandstorm out of the temple and now stand at the edge of the Stormcrest Mountains and the Frostweald Forest itself. So. You all take a moment to gather your thoughts, think over what just transpired, and think on your next course of action.
Laura: Well, I want that bow. (laughs)
Marisha: I heard a few things that seemed very desireable.
Liam: How is Pike?
Sam: Yeah, Pike, are you alive?
Ashley: I-- yes. (laughter)
Laura: He healed us all up before we left, right?
Ashley: He healed us. Yes, I'm fine! I'm fine.
Matt: Well, not completely, you guys healed from a couple of spells that were cast at the time, but you haven't had a rest.
Marisha: But some of us are still older, right?
Matt: Indeed.
Liam: Is your stomach closed?
Laura: Yeah?
Matt: You go and inspect the armor itself, the plates that separated and scraped from the impact of Craven Edge's blade. The wound itself seems to have at least stopped bleeding as part of the healing magic and the wound has closed, though you're still in a relatively damaged state post-battle. You guys haven't had really a moment to recover and heal what you could. She seems to be okay. There's still that lingering sweat from the stress and the impact of the blade, but nothing seems to be mortally endangered about her current state.
Liam: Do you need a moment, do you need to speak to Sarenrae?
Ashley: I think I'm okay. Do I know what hit points I'm at?
Matt: Yes. You're at 63.
Ashley: I'm doing okay.
Laura: What time is it?
Matt: Right now, from the time it took you guys to go through the temple and the strangeness that is the shift of time around the temple, it's probably mid-day. Pretty much the same time you entered the temple.
Marisha: Weird.
Travis: I'm really sorry about that.
Ashley: Hey, it's okay, Grog. I know you didn't mean to.
Travis: No. No, I didn't. I was floating away, you should've seen the inside. It was wind everywhere.
Ashley: It sounds pretty crazy.
Travis: Yeah. And I was like, what would my buddy Pike do? She would take the sword and attach the chain to it and throw it through the door! And then you were there!
Ashley: It's okay, Grog! I'll be fine.
Travis: Yeah, but you're my best buddy!
Ashley: Oh, Grog.
Travis: Do you want one of my healing potions, are you sure you're all right?
Ashley: I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be okay. I think if we just-- (laughs) I'm excited to see you guys. (laughter)
Ashley: I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be okay.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Are we taking a rest? I don't know how many--
Laura: It's mid-day!
Taliesin: I think a short rest would not be a bad idea.
Marisha: I don't think this is actually the time of day, I don't think nature works the same around this temple.
Travis: What do you mean? It's magic time of day?
Marisha: Kind of, but it's always magic time of day.
Laura: So maybe we should hang out in the mouth of the cave and take a short rest
Marisha: I'm all right with that.
Laura: Yes?
Ashley: I would be okay with that.
Matt: Ashley, you've used a 5th-level spell. How many 4th-level spells do you have, because you used two I believe?
Ashley: Three 4th-level.
Matt: So you have one left.
Laura: Maybe we should take a long rest.
Marisha: We could try and hoof it home.
Taliesin: I think we start moving in that direction and when nightfall comes we make camp.
Travis: Towards the campsite?
Laura: Unless I was healed, and I don't remember being healed, I'm at 11 health points. So I'm feeling a little sore.
Ashley: Oh gosh!
Sam: He only healed a couple of us.
Marisha: I thought she was the one that he--
Laura: He healed me back to my age.
Matt: Yeah, the aging effect was restored, but only to her. The rest of you are still aged up based on the effect of the lair of the sphinx.
Marisha: That's something we're going to have to Restoration away.
Travis: Please, I'm handsome as fuck right now, come on.
Laura: Did you get aged?
Travis: Like a fine wine. Yeah, I got aged.
Ashley: Can you do Greater Restoration on a group?
Matt: No, on an individual each time.
Ashley: Who is the oldest?
Travis: Well, she was.
Laura: I was and he healed me.
Liam: Typically Scanlan is the oldest, but I've been aged the most maybe.
Laura: He's really fucking old right now. Look at all those wrinkles.
Ashley: How old are you?
Laura: His ears are starting to droop!
Matt: If I recall, you aged close to roughly 20 to 25 years.
Ashley: You look like a fine wine, you just got better with age.
Liam: I knew that this was coming, I just thought I had more years until it happened.
Ashley: They gray looks great on you, the salt and pepper hair.
Marisha: You should really look at this as a nice peek into the future. It's not bad.
Liam: Yeah, so--
Ashley: Would you like to be younger?
Travis: Young again?
Ashley: Would you like to be young again?
Liam: It's probably a good idea.
Laura: Are you sure you want to do it, Pike, are you sure?
Liam: You could do it tomorrow, could you take care of my sister first, Pike?
Ashley: Yes. We need to get you into better order, okay? All right, where we at here?
Travis: Oh, I don't cast that.
Liam: Give her the works.
Marisha: So, we are taking a short rest? I'm going to burn a couple of hit dice.
Laura: Shorty rest and then we'll walk.
Matt: Everyone taking a short rest?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: Yes?
Travis: (emphatically) Yes.
Ashley: I'm going to heal her up.
Laura: I mean, I could roll my own hit dice.
Ashley: No, no, it's my job.
Travis: So I lose all the buffs, right?
Matt: Here's what happens. So as you guys are taking a rest, you step a little bit away from the group, sit down and hold the blade. Chain's still attached across your lap. Just look down at it and you can see it's still pulsing with the power of all the life energy that it'd taken before. And as you take a moment, see to your wounds, relax, recover from the intense rage and all the emotional pain that's transpired here, the blade begins to shrink. You hear the slight crackle (squeal) as the metal begins to creak and pull backward, all the jagged edges pulling into the central singular curved blade at the front of it. As it hits, it seems to almost shrink slightly smaller than it was before and the metal creaks for a second and a voice in your head goes, (breathes heavily) "Hungry--" Make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Oh shit. Now it's going to steal his strength.
Travis: Natural 20.
Marisha: What?
Liam: Eat it, sword.
Matt: For but a moment, you sense a very similar feeling, one that-- it's been really since the battle with K'Varn when all of the light in the world vanished for a second and darkness took your consciousness, and that same cold sensation starts to stem from the blade itself like it's actually trying to pull you into it, and you resist it. And you stand there and look at the blade and it just-- in comparison to its larger form, it looks small. It's the same size it was since you originally got it, but you look at it there in this long, still silence as you try and conjecture what just transpired. And in that silence you hear the voice once again go, "Feed. Now."
Travis: I don't have anything to feed you.
Matt: "Find something."
Travis: (exhales) All right, all right, all right. What?
Laura: Who you talking to, Grog?
Travis: I'm so hungry. My stomach's rumbling.
Sam: Don't we have our cold pack of food?
Marisha: We do and we have some boar meat.
Laura: Yeah, sure.
Ashley: Or some chicken?
Laura: Yeah I did, I think I did take quite a bit of chicken.
Sam: Love me some chicken.
Matt: As you open the freezer chest there's a (poof) of chicken-scented smoke and mist that vanishes.
Laura: Aw, the chicken, we can't take it. That's okay, I've got boar meat. Do you want to feed your stomach the boar meat?
Travis: What? My stomach?
Ashley: Yeah, are you hungry?
Travis: Yeah, I would not turn down some delicious boar.
Laura: I'll mark it down to half the boar meat is gone now, you guys.
Sam: Wow, he's a big eater. That was a lot. That was a whole boar.
Laura: Well, he's a big guy.
Liam: You're a good hunter, though, it's not really--
Laura: That's right. Well?
Taliesin: We can find some more boar if we have to.
Sam: If we're rested, are we going to set off again?
Matt: You guys can use your hit dice if you want to, to heal up.
Travis: Do I get a level of exhaustion back or no? Long rest?
Matt: No, long rest for your exhaustion.
Travis: Fuck!
Ashley: So short rest means--
Liam: That sword is an asshole.
Sam: Be honest.
Travis: That should've been at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Yeah, should've been at disadvantage.
Matt: Roll again.
Marisha: Oh fuck! No!
Taliesin: Do it!
Laura: You have to roll again?
Sam: He's exhausted.
Ashley: Fuck!
Marisha: No! You're lying!
Sam: What is it?
Taliesin: It's a one. He rolled a one.
Liam: (high-pitched) What are the odds?
Travis: 5% both times.
Liam: Everybody roll for initiative
Laura: No joke, though!
Matt: As you guys finish your rest, and you're all gathering the next stage of your advancement, you watch as Grog stands up and starts walking into the snow of the forest with the blade out, topples and falls to one knee, then falls face-first in the snow.
Sam: (yells)
Ashley: Grog? I run over to him.
Laura: We all run out.
Sam: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matt: He's still, he's cold, there are no signs of life.
Liam: Roll him over, roll him over! Grog!
Laura: I slap him across the face.
Liam: Yeah. Punch him across the face. Grog! Pike?
Sam: Heal, heal, heal!
Ashley: I grab the sword and I take it off of his-- away from him, off of his person.
Matt: Okay, you pull the blade and you take it and you shove it off, and the chain's still attached to the side of his arm. You have to pull-- make a strength check.
Liam: Use those gauntlets.
Laura: Oh yeah, 19!
Ashley: What do I-- roll the 20?
Matt: And add four to it.
Ashley: 11?
Matt: 11, that's enough. You (clink) and you pull the chain off the side of his forearm, toss the blade and it (scrapes) skids to a stop in the snow, cutting a shallow swath through the little bit of the embankment. Grog's still rolled on his back, eyes just dead, lifeless.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Pike is it the sword, is it the sword?
Ashley: I feel like it's the sword, I mean we all know that sword has been weird.
Laura: Can you Greater Restoration him?
Ashley: Yes, I'll Greater Restoration on Grog.
Marisha: While she does Greater Restoration, I want to go over and--
Liam: Break it.
Laura: Don't break it!
Marisha: -- grab the sword and see-- yeah, actually, can I do like a--
Sam: Don't--
Marisha: What?
Sam: Don't break it.
Marisha: Why not?!
Sam: His soul could be inside of it
Laura: What do you mean, his soul could be inside of it?
Sam: I touched the sword, it spoke to me, it craves strength from other beings
Marisha: Wait, what do you mean it spoke to you?
Matt: Here's my question to you, Pike. What spells do you have?
Ashley: Okay, so short rest--
Matt: Short rest doesn't give you any spells back. What level spells do you have still?
Ashley: I have a 5th-level. I have one 5th-level, which is Greater Restoration.
Matt: Right, you have Greater Restoration as an option there. What other spells do you have prepared?
Ashley: Aw, shit. I mean, Cure Wounds? No, that's not going to do anything.
Matt: Because from your knowledge and experience, Greater Restoration removes serious curses, it removes avenues--
Ashley: But wouldn't that be--?
Matt: Grog, though you are having a hard time coming to terms with it, in the back of your head there's a part of you that knows that right now, Grog in the snow is dead.
Ashley: Oh no!
Liam: Where can we take him, where can we take him?
Laura: How can he be, how can he be dead?
Liam: Can we take him to Gilmore, can we take him to--?
Marisha: Scanlan, what should I do with this sword?
Sam: Don't break it.
Marisha: Should I cast something through it to try and purge whatever it is out of it?
Sam: You could try to do Greater Restoration on the sword to see if that would somehow free the soul from it or--
Marisha: I can do like a Sunbeam spell, that's like a light spell.
Liam: Who could we take him to, could we tree to Gilmore?
Laura: He wouldn't know anything about these-- Can we go back in?
Marisha: I didn't bring anything because we decided to hoof it.
Laura: What about going back to Kamal?
Marisha: I didn't bring a transportation spell because we decided to walk.
Laura: No, but he's right inside the cave, what if he knows things? The sphinx!
Sam: The sphinx-- yeah. We could go to the sphinx.
Ashley: I have Heal, I have one 6th-level.
Matt: Heal? Heal restores damage or damaged flesh to living entities.
Laura: Me and Scanlan go back into the cave and search for Kamal again.
Taliesin: I'm grabbing the sword and taking it to a corner and I'm going to stare at it for a second.
Matt: Okay. What are you doing, you're going to...?
Laura: Me and Scanlan take flight and we go back in and we try to find Kamal again.
Matt: Okay. You guys cruise into the cavern and as you sit inside where the stairs were that led into the temple, it's solid stone.
Laura: Shit!
Matt: There's no sign of an entrance whatsoever to this temple.
Ashley: Wait, wait. I have Revivify!
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Learned?
Ashley: Yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Has it been enough time?
Ashley: You touch a creature that has died--
Matt: Within the last minute.
Laura: Has it been a minute? He just did it, it just happened!
Taliesin: It's barely been a minute of real time.
Laura: We just ran over!
Ashley: I wasn't even looking at my 3rd-levels.
Matt: Ashley, go ahead and roll an initiative check.
Ashley: Oh, goodness. Okay.
Taliesin: Can I assist with a whisper to the sword?
Matt: Sure.
Sam: Can I inspire her?
Matt: Sure.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: You do first.
Sam: I just hold her hand and I look in her eyes and I just say, "Please, Pike, please. Please. I love him as much as you do. Please."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Take your d10, and if you want to go ahead and use that now or make this as part of the resurrection ritual, which we're now undergoing.
Laura: Oh my god.
Ashley: Can I do this first? Just to see if it works?
Matt: Well, what'd you roll for your initiative?
Ashley: 14.
Matt: 14, okay. You get to his body and his back rolled in the snow looking up, just as that window of time begins to fade for the magic to have any effect. You reach down and you grasp his cold-muscled chest and you find the one singular thread, that little soul thread that's still connected to the essence of his eternal being that once resided within this corpse and you clutch onto it with the magic and hold on to it to begin this ritual. Who wishes to bring something to this ritual? You have hold of the thread right now, you need something stronger to keep him here.
Laura: Is that stupid? (laughs anxiously)
Taliesin: No! It's not stupid!
Laura: Okay, okay. Then I reach into the Bag of Holding and I get out Grog's cask of ale.
Matt: Okay. And--? And what do you do with it?
Laura: Okay. I pour a little in his mouth. Just a little bit, so he doesn't choke.
Matt: (laughing) You reach over and you grab the edge of his beard and pull his mouth open, it's hanging limply. You pull off the cork of the cask and begin pouring it and it spills down the side into the snow, darkening it on the sides of his head.
Laura: I turn his head so he doesn't drown in it.
Matt: Understood. Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: This is so stressful. 16?
Matt: Okay. The ale seems to slide back into the throat and find its way in towards the stomach. There is no swallowing motion whatsoever, but it appears that at least it's not drowning him or blocking his airway. You're clutching onto the spirit here. You only have a few moments left before the magic is lost. Who wishes to--
Liam: While that's going on I walk off 30 feet away and I fall to my knees on the ground facing away. I know you are not what I want. But you are what we need. And I will put aside my reservations and serve you. It is too soon for him, we need him. He is needed. I will set aside my reservations and serve you. Please.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a religion check.
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15. As you're looking up into the frozen boughs of the trees before you, a little bit of snow begins to fall from what was once the still air. It begins to dot the top of your face and touch your nose, and as the first cold singular snowflake hits, your vision goes dark again. In that darkness, you feel your breath go cold as well, and your whole body is locked in place like it can't move. And all you see is the white porcelain face of the Raven Queen step out of the darkness as her hand comes up and touches the side of your cheek. And a voice in your head, a familiar voice, says, "I believe that every death has its place." And the hand lets go and pulls back. Who wishes to make the third and final aid to this ritual?
Sam: Have I already aided by inspiring Pike?
Matt: Well, if Pike wants to go ahead and make a roll of some sort of attempt at this, that would help as Bardic Inspiration.
Sam: But I can't help again?
Matt: If you wish to do your own thing, you can.
Ashley: Just for extra, yeah.
Sam: The sword seems to want power and strength. I don't know if it will help, but maybe if we gave Grog some extra strength it might help him to come back, so. I have a Potion of Fire Giant Strength.
Marisha: I could cast an Enhance Ability spell.
Sam: He has no abilities now, though.
Marisha: That's true.
Sam: So I'm going to pour this Potion of Fire Giant Strength into his gullet.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Hope it gives him some sort of strength.
Matt: Go ahead and make an arcana check.
Sam: Okay. 18.
Matt: 18, okay. As you pour the potion into his throat, the somewhat thick red and yellowish compound that drips from it like a thicker molasses finds its way, mingling with the ale currently in his gullet. You help try and massage it down, like feeding a pill to a dog. As you do, you can see the veins around the shoulders instinctually affected by this, as the flesh itself, you know, the cells are still alive. It's just the nervous system and all else that the lights are currently out on. You hope this is enough. And as you hold onto that singular thread of Grog's existence--
Laura: He's taking a picture
Marisha: Why is he taking a picture?
Sam: Because it's not good.
Taliesin: Because he's a terrible person, that's why he's taking a picture.
Marisha: It's either really good or really bad.
Laura: I know, yeah, it's either really good or really bad.
Travis: I can't hide.
Laura: Matthew!
Marisha: This is bullshit.
Matt: As you're certainly staring at the sword--
Taliesin: I was going to say something to it.
Matt: What do you say to it?
Taliesin: If I were you, I'd put it back. Or else it will be the last meal you ever eat, because I will find an abyss so deep and so far you will never taste a drop of blood again. And I'm not touching it. I touched it and put it down and let go and said that to it.
Matt: The shadow begins to bleed from the blade and rise up and it seems almost like an incensed fury from your words. However, you also hear a raging scream bellow from inside the blade. A familiar yell echoing in distant (roars).
Taliesin: I'll start summoning my own fucking mist, man, I'm not fucking intimidated by this shit.
Matt: Your shadow begins to rise over your back as well. As it begins to coalesce, these two black centers of dark energy facing off in wordless anger and lack of understanding, the arm of Grog's body grabs you by the throat and starts clutching as it sits up and looks you in the face, eyes red with rage, going (growl). Roll a strength check.
Laura: Oh my god!
Sam: Strength check?! He's got 25 strength now!
Travis: Disadvantage still?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: He's going to crush my neck.
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. He manages to close off the windpipe just for a short moment, but in that time the red fades from his eyes and the first inhale of breath (gasps) comes into Grog's chest, and your vision clears. And the moment of confusion hits you as you look around and notice this tiny gnome in your grip, head beet-red as you notice that your thumbs are pressed into his larynx.
Travis: No, no. No. (clears throat) What'd you do to me?
Sam: (gasps) Nothing.
Laura: What the fuck is that sword, Grog?
Sam: Gave you some ale.
Sam: What's with you and gnomes today, man?
Travis: I like gnomes, I don't know! What? Why am I down here?
Marisha: Are we sure it's him? Scanlan? Percy? Percy, are we sure?
Sam: Nope! I'm not sure. I'll do a perception check to see if it's--
Marisha: Can I also do an insight check? Can I assist him or make an insight as well?
Matt: You can make your own insight check.
Sam: 17.
Marisha: Sorry. 23.
Laura: What?
Taliesin: I love a whisper.
Liam: I don't.
Laura: How come he's getting a whisper and you're not getting a whisper? Hey, you guys (sobbing) check out those "How Do You Want to do This" hoodies-- (laughter)
Taliesin: I want to do this with great pain and sadness.
Ashley: This is so stressful!
Laura: Oh my god, you came back and Grog died!
Ashley: I want to go back!
Matt: He rolled a 20, then he rolled a one.
Travis: I did my classic ten-minutes-later remembering-the-rules shit.
Matt: That's right, because you got the third point at the end of that battle because you frenzied for that last fight.
Marisha: Grog! How many fingers am I holding up?
Liam: Six.
Travis: Nine!
Marisha: I think it's him. All right.
Sam: Oh my god.
Laura: Grog, you died!
Ashley: You fell over dead!
Marisha: How many more of us are going to die?!
Travis: No, I didn't. No.
Laura: Yes. You did.
Travis: What, when?
Laura: Pike saved you. Pike brought you back.
Sam: Where's your sword, Grog?
Travis: My sword is-- where is my sword?
Sam: Yeah, exactly.
Ashley: It's not your sword anymore.
Travis: What do you mean?! Wait, wait. Where is my-- where's Craven Edge?
Matt: You sit up and glance over, and you see about 15 feet from you, set up against the bottom of a tree, the blade is currently being crouched over by Percy, his fingers tense, his shoulders and back arched and locked, and you see two shadow sources that are almost on their own subtle plane having a staredown.
Laura: Shit.
Travis: Hey! Hey, Percy! Percy!
Taliesin: Little busy.
Marisha: Do you want to explain this, Grog?
Laura: Can we see what's going on?
Matt: You guys look over and you see this happening, yeah.
Travis: Well, I mean he's obviously messing with other people's property! And I walk over to the sword.
Marisha: No, no, no!
Laura: I run over and I block it. I stand next to Percy and I block the sword.
Travis: What?
Ashley: Yeah, I walk over and I stop Grog.
Liam: I'm pulling out daggers and standing behind my sister. Grog. Grog, let it go.
Travis: Let what--
Liam: This has been something on the tip of our tongue for weeks. Let it go. Whatever that thing is, it's fucked. Let it go!
Travis: But it's my sword.
Marisha: It was never your sword, was it, Grog?
Travis: I mean, Percy gave it to me, but it's mine.
Laura: Percy gave it to you?
Sam: Yeah. Yeah, he let him have it.
Travis: Yeah, we traded. Fair and square.
Liam: What did you say?
Taliesin: Little busy.
Liam: Scanlan, what?
Sam: Grog, listen, when I experienced the sword, it was pretty cool, and it is a powerful, powerful weapon, but after seeing what it's just done to you, I don't think you can have it, man.
Travis: I'm still a bit fuzzy. Like I mean, you know, we fought the sphinx, it got super-gnarly, and then we took a little rest and you-- did you see it shrunk?
Laura: Grog! The sword pulled you into it! You were dead, your soul was with whatever the fuck is in there now.
Travis: Well, how did I get out of there?
Laura: Pike saved you.
Ashley: We brought you back!
Sam: We? It was you, Pike.
Travis: Oh, like just now?
Ashley: It was a group effort!
Travis: Why do I taste ale, and whiskey?
Ashley: Because she gave you a little to bring you back!
Travis: I mean, I didn't know if I'd thrown up in my mouth, and like swallowed it.
Matt: The shadow has now rescinded into the blade.
Taliesin: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yes, Percy?
Taliesin: I'm debating whether or not to touch the sword. And I'm debating whether or not you should touch the sword.
Laura: Nobody should touch the sword, Percy.
Taliesin: We have to move it.
Sam: I've touched it before and it was fine. I can touch it again.
Ashley: Well, I could try to--
Laura: I feel like it's going to try and suck anybody in right now.
Marisha: Well, what should we do with it? We should get rid of it?
Travis: Look, guys, I can carry it at least.
Laura: No.
Ashley: No! You're not going to touch it again!
Taliesin: It's a bad deal.
Liam: Put it in the Bag of Holding and give the Bag of Holding to Pike.
Marisha: Wait, no, we're not putting that in the Bag of Holding. That sounds like a terrible idea. However, let me read something really fast.
Laura: Can we talk to it? I mean, can we see what it is?
Matt: I mean, you see a blade before you.
Laura: The shadow's not there anymore?
Matt: The shadow's pulled back into the blade.
Ashley: Percy, what did you get from it?
Laura: I mean, what did it sound like?
Sam: It sounded evil.
Travis: Well, now, that's really judgmental.
Sam: And also awesomely powerful.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: What were you going to say, Vax?
Liam: de Rolo knew about this. That's perfectly clear. You knew about this too, Scanlan?
Sam: I didn't know what it was. And I wasn't alone in this; I had asked Pike to weigh in and she was thinking about it. Doing more research.
Ashley: That's true.
Marisha: Pike knew about it as well? Wait, how many people knew about this?
Travis: Yeah! Only four of us. Look, it's been a great ally!
Laura: Four out of seven!
Sam: Vax, I assume you have secrets you haven't told us.
Laura: He has a third testicle. It's out. There, I said it!
Liam: That's a great time for a joke. That's a great time for a joke.
Taliesin: Best time for a joke.
Sam: The weird part is it's not in his crotch area.
Ashley: I could try casting Greater Restoration on the sword.
Marisha: I might be able to Banish it.
Taliesin: Can you do that?
Travis: Well, that's a bit strong, don't you think?
Sam: And that's only for a minute.
Marisha: No, I can do a more permanent version of that. I've never tried it before. And it's a 7th-level spell.
Travis: Look, look! Okay. Look, if you get bucked off a horse, right? You don't kill the horse, you just train it up a bit. Let's just work with the sword.
Laura: Horses don't try to steal your soul, Grog.
Liam: Who owned the sword before you had it? Who?
Travis: Ah. Well.
Liam: Find it on the ground?
Laura: Oh. It was Lord Briarwood.
Liam: It's very familiar, that's right. It belonged to the arch-vampire who we fucked up.
Travis: Yeah. Right.
Marisha: And I hate to be the one to point it out, but I feel like you've been almost a little bit more brutal than you usually are here lately, which is almost impressive.
Taliesin: Grog, I'm going to make you a deal. We're going to deal with this as a family, and we're going to get you something much nicer.
Marisha: It just killed you.
Taliesin: Right away. We're going to replace it with something a little less complicated.
Laura: Maybe some bone knuckles? I hear those are pretty badass.
Travis: Bone?
Laura: Giant's bone?
Travis: Titanstone?
Marisha: Maybe a family heirloom?
Taliesin: Perhaps it's time to be a better badass.
Sam: Does, DM, does Suggestion last forever or just for a little amount of time?
Matt: Suggestion, I think it lasts for a short time.
Marisha: I can attempt to Plane Shift this into another dimension.
Laura: No, how about we just wrap it in fabric. No?
Travis: Well look, hey, look, all right, fine, look, I won't touch it. But can we like at least figure out what it was doing? Lord Briarwood had it, I asked it a few questions, like if it knew Vecna. And we just got to see it level up a little bit.
Marisha: What all has it told you, Grog?
Travis: It's always hungry, right, so it likes to be, it likes what I do--
Ashley: Grog!
Travis: What? What, I'm hungry too!
Liam: Show of hands. Who here is uncomfortable with that piece of shit?
Ashley: I mean, it stabbed me, so yeah, I'm uncomfortable.
Travis: I said I was sorry, I really--
Ashley: It's okay. It's not your fault.
Laura: But I do think that whatever it is might know something.
Marisha: Well, Grog said he's been talking to it, which makes--
Taliesin: You don't want to interrogate it, because if we interrogate it we're going to have to make a deal.
Liam: You have to choose between this group and that sword.
Travis: Oh, well I choose the group, I mean, I voted I was uncomfortable as well.
Liam: So what are we arguing about?
Travis: Well, I don't just want to destroy it.
Marisha: It served its purpose. You got its fair use. You got your money's worth, which was free.
Travis: Yeah, but I could use it on Kevdak.
Taliesin: It can use you on Kevdak.
Laura: Do not use it against Kevdak. You don't want something making your strength unnatural when you fight your new foe.
Travis: Well look, the last I remember was it said it was hungry. If it gets hungry again, I'll just give it something to eat.
Marisha: Like one of us?
Travis: No, like my thigh or something.
Laura: You'll chop off your own leg--
Travis: No, I would just stab it.
Marisha: You want to sacrifice your own leg for a sword?
Travis: Kevdak has the Titanstone Knuckles. It's a Vestige that we're looking for, right? It's going to be a hell of a fight, and this is a hell of a sword.
Laura: He's got a Vestige. He's still just him.
Liam: The sword just fucking killed you, you dummy!
Marisha: And you were far powerful before the sword. You killed Lord Briarwood without the sword.
Laura: That's right.
Marisha: The sword didn't make you Grog.
Travis: All right, hold on, Pike. Look. If we're going back to Kevdak. You know I'm not scared of death, right? I would die by a dragon, I would die by a beholder, and I wouldn't care, as long as it was a beautiful death. But I don't want to die from Kevdak. Not him.
Ashley: We'll find you a better weapon. I don't want you to die from something that's not worth it.
Travis: All right. Fine. Do what you want with it. I don't need it.
Taliesin: What do you think we should do with it?
Ashley: We'll find you something strong.
Travis: This is an empty cup.
Taliesin: Oh, we've already poured it into your mouth.
Laura: No, there's a little left in the cask, here. Here's your cask.
Travis: I throw the cup away and just take the cask.
Marisha: All right. Should I attempt to banish this thing forever?
Sam: You can banish something forever?
Marisha: It's called Plane Shift, I can shift it into its own little pocket dimension where it'll stay and nothing else can get to it.
Taliesin: I think I'm perfectly content with it being someone else's problem.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: I'm staring hard to make sure it's not going to fight this.
Marisha: So looking at Plane Shift, it says you can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. But I can also transport eight willing creatures, so can I hold the sword and attempt to Plane Shift it away?
Matt: I don't see why you would not be able to do that to an object, honestly. Especially based on the power of the spell. Where would you want to banish it to?
Marisha: Ooh. Ooh! Ooh!
Liam: Newark.
Marisha: The pocket dimension of the green-eyed boy. The golden-eyed boy.
Matt: Oh!
Laura: The Dread Emperor that we already killed.
Marisha: Yes, it was empty, it was his own dimension and he's dead.
Matt: It was the Dread Emperor.
Taliesin: Well, let's think about this.
Marisha: What?
Sam: What else lives there?
Marisha: Nothing.
Liam: It was an island with child labor, it's full-circle for Keyleth.
Taliesin: I'm going to suggest something that's going to sound a little iffy, but I swear to god I'm being clever. Send it somewhere where it will be content. Let's not anger something. Where do we send vampires?
Marisha: I could easily send it to one of the Nine Hells, where I'm sure someone would be very happy with the new gift they just found.
Laura: No! Somebody could use it.
Marisha: Exactly.
Taliesin: But they would be using it in the Nine Hells. And it's going--
Marisha: Yes, but you forget that all these planes cross over. We have fought many a demon.
Liam: I don't want to send it to the Hells.
Travis: Can I make like one little suggestion that doesn't involve it coming back to me? I had a thought that since Lord Briarwood had it before, that every time it killed it might've been sending that life back to Vecna? But I don't have any proof of that, you know, I just remember being in that room with all the bodies, with the little sphere of-- the little dough button in the middle of the room.
Sam: We could throw it in the sphere.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: No. That might go poorly.
Travis: Or really cool?
Marisha: I mean, does anyone else have any better ideas where to send this thing?
Ashley: What would happen if you threw it into the sphere?
Sam: Vecna would get it, right?
Ashley: It would get, yeah, that would be bad.
Laura: How about you throw it in that pocket dimension and then we can always go to that same pocket dimension and get it if we decide it's bad there.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: That's true. I mean, it's its own little pocket. It's at least blocked off. That we know of.
Laura: Drop it in a thorny patch.
Marisha: I'm going to go for that Dread Emperor dimension.
Liam: Percival? Percy?
Taliesin: Yes?
Liam: You are clever.
Taliesin: I am.
Liam: It doesn't mean you're always right.
Taliesin: I know. I know.
Marisha: And you do have this terrible habit of liking to push problems on other people.
Ashley: You don't think it would work if I tried Greater Restoration?
Laura: Do you have any more 5th-level?
Ashley: I do, I have one more 5th-level.
Laura: Oh, you do?
Ashley: I do.
Taliesin: I don't think so, but what do I know?
Laura: Why not try it? Before we send it.
Liam: We can camp here for the night. We don't have to go anywhere.
Taliesin: That's fair, yes.
Marisha: Wait, you want to do Greater Restoration, why?
Taliesin: On the sword.
Travis: I'm at one hitpoint.
Laura: You're at--?
Taliesin: I'm going to kick myself if I'm right.
Ashley: Okay, hold on a minute.
Travis: I could just take a healing potion.
Marisha: It needs a wielder, Percy.
Taliesin: Does it? All right, let's-- go ahead. I'm curious.
Ashley: First, Grog is at one hit point. Okay? So I'm going to use my 6th-level and I'm going to use Heal.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right. As Pike turns to you, looks you in the eye, clutching her holy symbol of Sarenrae, there's a smile at the corner of her mouth at noticing that her friend is back. Though as tenuous as this argument has been, and you weren't present for the scare that was there, you can see there is a genuine shake to a lot of their fingertips from what has just transpired. She reaches forward and touches you and you immediately heal 70 hitpoints.
Laura: Bam! Shebang.
Travis: (sings) I feel amazing.
Laura: What do you think Greater Restoration will do?
Ashley: I don't know. Because I remember it worked one time on-- didn't we try that on his--
Taliesin: In my mind I have a worst-case scenario, but.
Laura: I'm afraid it will make whatever's in the sword come out.
Marisha: That's what I'm afraid of as well.
Laura: But if it comes out then we can banish it or kill it and--
Ashley: And then he could keep the sword.
Laura: It will be just a useless sword at that point.
Travis: Not if I'm wielding it.
Sam: Something tells me you won't be wielding it.
Taliesin: I'm tempted to ask you to do it just because I would love to be wrong.
Laura: Fucking try it, Pike!
Ashley: Should we try it? Let's try it.
Travis: Yeah, go for it. We've got a backup if there's something wrong.
Matt: So, as Pike turns around from Grog, the softness in her face fades, and the hard jawline of Pike Trickfoot, seafaring gnome cleric, steps across the snow, step by step towards the darkened blade that nearly stole away her childhood friend. Still clutching in one ogre-gauntleted fist the symbol of Sarenrae, your other hand comes out and you can see the shadow begin to spill from the blade as you approach.
Marisha: Pike, be careful.
Sam: I'm going to inspire her again. I'm going to sing a very romantic ballad.
Ashley: Bring it.
Sam: (sings) Oh my little pretty one, my little pretty one, Pike the Gnome-a, oh you make my nipples hum, my nipples hum, oh you make my nipples hum, Pike the Gnome-a. (laughter)
Matt: Take your d10 inspiration.
Liam: All sad and tragic and with gravitas.
Ashley: A d10?
Matt: A d10 inspiration die.
Ashley: That was beautiful, Scanlan.
Sam: I know.
Matt: All right. As you step forward and the shadow begins to emanate from the blade, you focus and concentrate, and as you do, the light of Sarenrae begins to glow from the front of your hand, and as it does, the shadow seems to be cast away, and the blade now stands currently bare before you. You reach out and touch the blade and recite a few words under your breath, and release the energy of the spell into the sword. Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Just roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Oh, that's good.
Ashley: 17.
Sam: You also have inspiration if you need it.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Add your d10 inspiration die to it.
Liam: Yeah!
Ashley: 26. No, wait. Yeah, 26.
Matt: As you reach out and touch the blade, you can feel suddenly the dark, chaotic presence in there. you can see flashes in your mind of an individual, an ancient person. You see flashes in your head of a clamoring for power, a need for attention and wealth. You see a person making a deal with something it didn't understand. You see a flash of a punishment. You see the remnants of their eternal soul bound to a blade. You see themselves cursed with eternal, gluttonous, unending hunger and cast through the ages, the rest forgotten. And you see, just like the singular thread that was holding Grog to his corpse, a dark, dark thread that connects the sword to Grog. And with this spell, you grasp out and clutch it-- and tear it in two. Grog, wherever you're standing, it's like you just got punched in the gut. You're thrown off your feet and land in the snow once again, eyes wide open. All of you freak out because it's just like how Grog fell originally, except for he shoots up, heavy breathing, alive. With that, the blade just snarls in your grasp.
Ashley: (laughs) Oopsie.
Laura: What just happened?
Matt: Grog? That fucking blade ate your soul.
Travis: What?
Matt: You wonder, this entire time, how you could be so foolish to give into something that this whole time has been using you.
Travis: How could I have been so foolish? This whole time, that fucking blade has been using me!
Marisha: Pike, let go, let go. Before it--
Laura: Drop the sword.
Ashley: I'm scared to let go of it.
Marisha: Let go of it!
Matt: (impact) It sits in the snow. Motionless.
Liam: Keyleth?
Marisha: It didn't attach itself to you now, did it, or anything?
Ashley: No. No.
Travis: Yo, guys, update. That sword is totally evil.
Ashley: Grog, what did you think we were telling you?
Marisha: I reach out and I Plane Shift it to the pocket dimension of the Dread Emperor.
Matt: Okay, you reach out and you pick up the blade, and as you grab it in your hand you can hear the voice, "You! I will--" And before it can finish the phrase, you guys watch as a little thin slit within the plane just shutters open, and you have a quick glance at that distant starscape with various broken, slowly floating islands of earth and rock. You see the partially destroyed bramble forest that you once trekked through, and with that, you throw the blade through the small doorway--
Laura: Eat it, Craven Edge!
Liam: (tiny voice) Help meeee.
Travis: Yeah, I'm not cravin' bacon anymore!
Matt: It slams shut and is gone.
Laura: Well? Fingers crossed nobody gets it.
Travis: And there was a dagger that came with it.
Laura: What?
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: What?
Travis: (laughs) I'm fucking with you.
Ashley: Grog.
Marisha: I know how that spell works now! That's nice.
Liam: What do you say we camp here for the night, everybody?
Taliesin: Let's camp here for the night.
Liam: Right in the cave.
Sam: Wait, it's not at night, it's the middle of the day.
Laura: We can just fucking hang out for a day.
Sam: Shouldn't we start walking?
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: No.
Laura: She's out of spells.
Liam: You got a hard-on for adventure, little man?
Sam: I just think we should make headway if we're going to be traveling all day. Grog, do you even have any weapons anymore?
Travis: I'm super exhausted--
Laura: Yeah, he's got so many weapons.
Sam: I could lend you my whip if you'd like.
Travis: No, I'm like Northrop Grumman meets Raytheon in this Bag of Holding, we're good.
Ashley: Since we got rid of Craven Edge, do you want the Gauntlets of Ogre Power back?
Travis: Oh no, I just gave them to you, though.
Ashley: Yeah, but you're the muscle. I take them off and I give them back.
Travis: What about if I trade you, what if I trade you--
Ashley: Are we doing a trade?
Travis: I have Boots of Levitation.
Ashley: Ooh!
Travis: Or I have black iron plate that while wearing this heavy plate armor the bearer gains resistance to any fire damage.
Laura: Ooh! That's good.
Sam: She already has plate armor.
Laura: Yeah, but this one gives her fire resistance.
Ashley: Does it maybe make me quiet as well?
Travis: I bet if you levitate you'd just be floating above the ground.
Liam: Levitate would make her quiet, yeah.
Laura: Does she have to-- in the levitation boots, can you move?
Matt: Levitation, someone has to push you along.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, that's fine, I'll take care of that.
Marisha: Oh my god, we can get like a little kid leash for you.
Laura: We could tie her onto the broom, we could tie her onto the broom!
Ashley: I could be a Pike kite!
Marisha: It'll be like that scene in Inception.
Travis: Yes! We'll discover electricity with you, you're a great conductor.
Ashley: Grog, that would kill me!
Travis: Oh. That's true. Which one you want?
Ashley: All right, I'll take Boots of Levitation. And you get these so you're super strong again.
Travis: I'll take my Gauntlets of Ogre Power back, strength back up to 19.
Liam: It was good times, though, Pike in those gauntlets. That was pretty cool.
Ashley: Hey, I felt real cool punching that chicken that one time. (laughter)
Ashley: One day I'll be strong.
Sam: Well, I think you just cured Grog, saved his life, and got rid of a soul-eating sword, so you're pretty strong.
Ashley: What did you say?
Sam: You killed the sword and saved Grog's life, so I think you're pretty strong.
Ashley: That's true, that's most important.
Travis: Way to go, badass.
Ashley: Hey, thanks.
Travis: No problem, man.
Ashley: Anytime.
Matt: (laughs) All right. So you guys go ahead and take a--
Travis: Long.
Laura: We just short-rested, but now we're going to sleep. It's been a traumatic five minutes.
Taliesin: We were in a time vortex, really it's time to sleep.
Matt: Fair enough. Where're you resting?
Liam: In the mouth of the cave.
Laura: In the mouth of the cave.
Travis: In the mouth of the cave.
Taliesin: No, no, no.
Sam: You guys can sleep wherever you want. I'll be sleeping in my bed.
Laura: Oh, in the mansion, fuck, we'll sleep in the mansion.
Liam: Sorry, you know, it's so new, it's hard to remember--
Laura: --that we have that.
Sam: Yeah. We do have it.
Marisha: Can I blow my last 5th-level spell to Greater Restoration somebody from their age?
Matt: Sure, yeah.
Sam: Oh, do we know? Are we aware that we went under that effect, I mean we just feel different, or how do--
Matt: No, you guys have-- it's one of those things where you felt the impact happen and you saw each other rapidly age for those that were present, and even afterward there's a noticeable effect, so yeah. You would be able to ascertain via those situations, and the time you've had to rest to think over the battle and see that difference. Plus the fact that you watched Vex get cured of that aging effect by the sphinx before you left, that was also the big indicator. So you would be aware.
Marisha: Who wants to go first?
Sam: You can do multiples?
Marisha: No, just one tonight. The rest of y'all have to stay old.
Travis: Take ol' wrinkly-nuts over there. (laughs)
Laura: Triple the wrinkles, triple the nuts.
Marisha: All right, come here, Vax.
Liam: Here I come, ol' wrinkly-nuts.
Taliesin: Can I borrow your broom for a bit?
Laura: You want to work on it? Or you want to fly around?
Taliesin: It's early, I might as well.
Laura: Can I stand next to you while you work on it? Would that bother you?
Taliesin: Only if you want to double the amount of time it takes me to work on it.
Laura: Oh, Percy, I just want to see what you're doing.
Taliesin: All right, it's very boring.
Sam: Wait, are we in the mansion or are we--
Matt: So you guys have all walked into the mansion at this point. Keyleth, you cast Greater Restoration, and you reach out to Vax. And what little bit of crow's-nest wrinkles, crow's feet that have crawled on the side of his face, and a little bit of the grey hairs that began to spray in the side, all revert back, skin tightens, he's back to his normal roguish half-elf average-aged self.
Liam: I am still older than you.
Laura: By like two whole minutes.
Liam: Which means I get to tell you what to do and don't you forget it.
Matt: All right, so all of you guys head into the mansion. Vex, you're helping Percy to the workshop?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay. What're you doing?
Taliesin: Hit dice just restore at the end of the day, correct?
Matt: Half of your spent hit dice is restored.
Laura: I pop Trinket out, of course, so he can hang out. Shake it out. Run around, get some exercise, I feel like an asshole for keeping you in this thing.
Matt: (bear noises) Goes into the kitchen. All right, so as you guys are preparing to rest for the evening, you head down to the workshop.
Taliesin: Yeah, just to work on the broom.
Matt: Okay. Are you aiding?
Taliesin: Sure.
Laura: Sure.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a tinkering check with advantage.
Taliesin: All right. Oh! With advantage. Very nice. It's new now, I have to remember, I got a new number. Natural 20.
Matt: You guys, there are other numbers between these, by the way.
Taliesin: Are there? Are there? LA-New York-LA-New York, sorry, yeah.
Matt: Don't poke the badger, Percy.
Taliesin: I gave it to Ashly this week, it was working fine.
Matt: Yeah, no.
Taliesin: The other Ashly.
Matt: All right, so. You guys work the evening, and though you were uncertain, Vex is actually a very quick learner and is eager to help, and so between bringing tools at your disposal and helping you hold a few places properly during the construction process, you manage to get far more headway than you expected in just an evening's bit of work. You still have probably a couple of days of work before you can actually complete your prototype for this and try it out, but--
Taliesin: Can I at least have the tether done, or is it still in progress?
Matt: The tether for?
Taliesin: For a dex save if you fall off.
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you've gotten that enough.
Taliesin: All right. Can't stabilize yet, but at least there's a-- okay.
Matt: Yeah. At least if there's ever a tumble there's a tether piece that would hopefully have a chance of keeping the broom with you, so.
Laura: Percy? I feel safer already.
Taliesin: Excellent. Yay to a constructive day. That was-- you're quite good at this, we should do this again sometime.
Laura: I would love that.
Taliesin: Yes, this was actually agreeable. All right.
Travis: I'm in the training room in my sandpit sleeping bed.
Matt: Which in contemplating over the experiences you've had, you now have access to the full Craven Edge weapon sheet.
Travis: The full one?
Ashley: That's a scroll.
Matt: Just so you know what it had done.
Laura: What it had done to you?
Travis: Oh, fuck you! (laughter)
Travis: (high-pitched) Okay.
Laura: Can I see, can we see it?
Travis: No.
Laura: Why? Come on.
Taliesin: I'm so excited.
Ashley: All I just saw was "dark aura" in really dark letters.
Travis: No, no, I can make really good origami now. Can I try and take out the flaming warhammer, the Firebrand Warhammer?
Matt: Yeah, you pull it out, take it, swing it around, dust it off a bit.
Travis: Can I get it to light?
Matt: Bursts into flames, and for a second that warmth near your face is like an old friend coming to roost for a bit.
Travis: Can you hear me? (laughter)
Matt: (fire sounds)
Travis: The silent type. I like it. (laughter)
Matt: All right. You guys all have your evening's rest. Though it is an early evening, you manage to comfortably, after a number of harrowing experiences, recoup, recover, wake up to a grand chickenful breakfast.
Marisha: Yeah. (laughter)
Sam: Chicken and eggs, everyone!
Laura: Yay!
Ashley: Chicken and waffles, perhaps?
Sam: Nope, just eggs.
Ashley: Oh, just eggs, okay.
Sam: What's a waffle?
Ashley: I don't know, it's like a mishmash of dough, the side--
Sam: Sounds great.
Taliesin: Can I spend my tinkering check building a waffle iron? I'm just kidding. I'm kind of kidding. I'm going to put that aside for later.
Matt: Okay. Okay.
Marisha: (laughs) I'm going to put that aside.
Sam: I spent some of the morning just with a little piece of parchment paper and a pen, just writing out something.
Matt: Okay. All right. You guys finish your rest, the servants are eager to send you on your way, should you require anything else. Otherwise, you guys continue your journey?
Taliesin: Let's head towards the town.
Sam: We walk, is that what we do?
Taliesin: We walk.
Sam: What is this walking thing? It's terrible.
Taliesin: It's also very inconspicuous. I know you're not a fan of inconspicuous, but there's nothing you want to be conspicu-ed by, here.
Marisha: I mean, I could mist, I could Wind Walk us. Do we want to Wind Walk it?
Sam: I mean, will that burn something?
Marisha: My 6th-level spell.
Sam: Let's just walk, then.
Matt: All right. You guys walking north?
Laura: I float on my broom.
Matt: Okay. Who's leading?
Laura: And keep an eye out in front for any sort of problems.
Liam: Have fun, doofus!
Laura: Shh! Yes, I'm leading.
Travis: This is a lot to leave off, that's a lot.
Matt: Well, you know. (laughter)
Travis: To not have. That's a big fucking difference.
Laura: Would you have kept it if you had known all those other things? Or would you have wanted to use more of it?
Travis: You don't know.
Matt: This is, by the way, the benefits of Identify spells and things like that.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Travis: Oh, well, if only I'd used my Identify spell.
Matt: But going forward, if you have something you don't know about, you can always go to people with those abilities and be like, could you see what the fuck this does?
Laura: Do any of our people have Identify?
Marisha: Negative. It's like a wizard thing.
Travis: I didn't even know people could do that.
Matt: Allura or Gilmore could probably do that for you.
Laura: Don't act like you know for sure. (laughter)
Liam: I know about Gilmore.
Ashley: Such a twinsies.
Matt: Aw, so good. All right, so. You guys start heading northward, you're leading then, Vex? Make a survival check. Technically in the forest, since you're moving through.
Liam: Yeah!
Laura: 26.
Matt: Not a problem. Utilizing the backtracking of the path you guys took through anyway, is there anything you want to do while you're in the forest? Pushing through? Okay. So you keep moving north--
Laura: Oh! Did you want to look for that lake, or are you good, Grog?
Travis: Oh, right, remember there was a lake when we were looking for the heart of a nymph?
Laura: Doesn't it lead into the Fey world? The plane?
Travis: Yeah, there's a portal there, right? And isn't one of the vestiges in the Fey?
Laura: In the Fey world?
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Do we want to do that first, or do we want to deal with--
Laura: We should probably, but I do want to come back here.
Taliesin: Oh yes, of course, it'll be right, next thing we do.
Travis: Yeah, only if it's close, otherwise I'm good to go back to Westruun. Only if the lake was close, I don't know where it is.
Liam: Are you in a hurry to talk to Dad?
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: We don't have to stop there, that's fine.
Liam: Maybe later.
Marisha: I mean, do you need to talk to Dad?
Liam: No. We do not need to talk to Dad.
Laura: Let's go to Westruun!
Taliesin: Westruun it is!
Liam: Sore spot.
Matt: Continuing pushing forward, I'd like you all to make a stealth check. (something clatters offscreen)
Laura: Oh, shit. (laughter)
Sam: Someone just failed it. Pike!
Matt: With disadvantage, Pike.
Ashley: Disadvantage? Okay.
Travis: I'm still there, right? No, we took a long rest!
Matt: Yeah, you're fine, you're no longer exhausted.
Travis: 28.
Ashley: Can I put on my Boots of Levitation?
Sam: Too late.
Liam: Too late.
Matt: Too late.
Ashley: I rolled a six.
Travis: Yeah, she's back!
Ashley: Pike is back! What would it be without some clanging?
Matt: So as you guys are making your way across the path, keeping as quiet as you can, Pike, you're starting to fall behind a little bit, and in trying to catch up, you get a run on before you start to hear this (hiss) out of the side of the forest, and you see a deep blue scaled-looking lizard entity. You see in the distance a basilisk that's coming over the ridge.
Marisha: Oh, again.
Taliesin: I wouldn't have let her get that far back, I would've been hanging back there too.
Matt: Okay, then you're hanging with her and you see this as well, what are you guys doing? It's about, it's about 30, 40 feet off.
Taliesin: How big is it?
Marisha: Should we run?
Matt: It's the same size as the other ones, they're about five and a half, six feet from nose to back end.
Travis: Let's run. I pick up Pike, I put her on my shoulder, and we run.
Matt: Okay. First off, Pike, I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: Aw, because you saw it.
Matt: You glanced over and saw it before you realized.
Ashley: I don't think I did, though. (laughter)
Ashley: Oh! I got 19.
Matt: 19, okay. Just the instinctual glance at it, you're like, oh crap, and you feel the impact of its gaze. However, you're a fairly hardy gnome and you resist the creeping stone-based enchantment. As you begin to run forward, Percy pushes behind you as Grog rushes forward, both of you guys recognizing that sound and averting your gaze, pick up Pike and you all begin charging forward. As you do, you can hear the hiss behind you gathered by a second one. (hissing) And the sounds of many feet charging through the snow quickly. I would like you guys all to go ahead and, we'll say for the sake of this, just roll dexterity checks. Or no, athletics. This would be your run speed on this one, sorry.
Laura: What if I'm on the broom, though?
Matt: If you're on the broom, you don't have to worry about it, you're not exerting energy to maintain a pace. Athletics.
Travis: 24.
Ashley: 19.
Liam: 30.
Marisha: Ten.
Taliesin: Ten.
Sam: 11.
Matt: Okay. You guys all manage to maintain a fairly decent pace; these creatures are fairly quick and as they begin to catch up, you begin to use your guidance as a person who knows the forest fairly well to begin ducking in and out of areas, using snowbanks at your disposal. At one point, Grog, you see a partially broken old dying tree that you just go ahead and grab and throw behind you. Make a strength check?
Travis: 21.
Matt: 21. With one hand you grab it and, boom, the actual trunk, old and long-rotted, snaps and falls behind you with a large impact. You believe from the sound of it, it at least hit or halted one of them for a short time, it's just a (snarl) sound. And as you guys continue pushing forward towards the northern side of this forest, the sound of the hissing begins to slowly subside as you dodge back and forth, zigzagging across this pathway. Eventually you guys, over about an additional hour and a half of pushing forward, you hear, and have not heard any following hissing sound for a while, and eventually see before you the outside of the Frostweald Forest finally approaching. With that, you guys push through the last elements of this frozen forest, back into the fields heading northward towards Westruun proper. With that, we're going to take a quick break. (cheering)
Matt: So yeah, we're going to go ahead and take a little trip here to the restroom, we'll see you guys here in a few minutes to continue the next length of this journey.
Travis: We get to play that shit again, right?
Liam: Why did it get so scary? [break]
Matt: And welcome back, everybody. So. Returning from-- Stop dying. Returning from that harrowing endeavor, you continue your trek northward toward Westruun. It is a few days' travel to make your way, a little over two days, I think, from where the Frostweald is, you can stop and pass by the camp at the lake if you wish to, or continue pressing forward, it's up to you.
Marisha: Well, we should probably stop by and tell them that their problem has been handled.
Taliesin: We could stop by later and tell them that both their problems have been handled.
Marisha: Why can't we stop by now? They're right here, we might as well pop in. We'll forget if we don't do it now. I know us. It'll be three months before we come back, and then we'll be like, by the way--
Laura: No, we're coming back soon because we're going into the Feywild.
Taliesin: Well, they know their problem's been handled because we sent all their people back to them.
Marisha: Let's just talk to them real fast. Okay. We pop in, we're like, hey.
Laura: I think Keyleth wants a reward.
Matt: You guys stop by the Foramere Basin, where you originally saw the encampment of some of the survivors of the Westruun incursion by the Chroma Conclave. As you approach, some of the guards immediately come up, crossbows up, when they notice who it was before previously, they lower their weapons and one of the guards comes forward, approaches you, saying, "Good to see that you've returned. We've managed to also acquire our recently captured individuals, most at least have come back safely, it's appreciated. If you wish to talk to Cornelius, well, he should be up and about. I'll take you." Leads you guys into the camp. As you find your way in, folks around you tend to stop again and watch you quietly as you pass, a few with smiles, and you see a few people wave and say, thank you. And you do see a couple of individuals that you did help escape from the orc encampment, they themselves are still on the mend, a lot of them were fairly brutalized when they were there, but the same child that you found in the tent just runs up and gives a big ol' hug to Vex and holds you for a second, then lets go and runs back off to her mother. You're led back to the tent where Cornelius originally met with you guys, but Cornelius is outside of the tent right now, just in the process of cutting firewood that's going to be used for the firepits later on.
Laura: Where'd he find the wood? I thought there were no trees around.
Matt: You imagine that they don't go to other nearby wooded areas and cut them down?
Travis: Yeah, poke the DM. (glass shatters offscreen)
Liam: Oh dear.
Matt: And that's what happens. (laughter)
Matt: You think that was an accident.
Taliesin: When you're in 50 episodes, this is the first one.
Marisha: This is the first one. It's like that scene in the second Matrix.
Matt: Let's not remember the second Matrix. Cornelius is there. What little bit of timber they've managed to scavenge or find from local wooded areas, Cornelius sits there, wipes his brow, his sleeves rolled up. "Oh. Hold on just a second." He puts his axe down and walks over, wipes his hands. "Well, you're true to your word. And for that I'm real appreciative. You did us a real favor and brought back some good people alive and intact."
Sam: Did your brother make it back safely?
Matt: "Cyrus did and I certainly had a very stern talking-to to that boy. But I--"
Sam: Don't go too hard on him, he was being held up by a rope and tortured by a bunch of monsters.
Laura: Pretty traumatizing, I would assume.
Matt: (laughs) "That would be him, wouldn't it? Well, nevertheless, I appreciate it. Looks like through some talks we might be able to bring most of us into Kymal for the time being. It's the town to the west of here. It's small, it's cramped, but we figure at least that's better than being out here in the open. And we have numbers there, so we'll be a little more protected."
Taliesin: Well, that's where we'll send word if anything happens in Westruun.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Heading to Westruun yourself, now?"
Marisha: It's next on the list.
Laura: If all goes well, you may be able-- no, I don't know.
Taliesin: Let's not make promises.
Laura: Dragons.
Marisha: Dragons.
Laura: It may be a while, but we're trying.
Matt: "Well, I wish you all the best of luck. Yeah. Figure if anyone could do it, it'd probably be you folk. Well. I look forward to hearing from your victorious recovery of our homestead, and I'll get the first round when we come back to our town."
Marisha: Farewell, Cornelius.
Matt: "Stay safe." He turns around and grabs his axe again and starts chopping through the wood once more.
Laura: Was there anything else you wanted to do, Keyleth?
Marisha: No, I'm good.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Do we need to check in with Drez? No, we know what he wants.
Liam: Fuck Drez.
Marisha: That guy's a weasel.
Sam: We have his Hunk of Quall.
Marisha: That was a gift, I'm pretty sure. It's a loaner, it's on loan for the foreseeable future until we save the world.
Ashley: Mr. Vina. Mr. Drez Vina.
Matt: Drez Vina, who is the assistant to Master Quall. Who is the one that originally hired you. And by the fact that he called a debt on the initial enchanted ruby that you used on your first endeavor, yeah, you get the feeling that whatever this object is that he gave you, it's probably on loan.
Ashley: (coughs)
Travis: Pike! Are you all right?
Sam: Heal her!
Matt: So you guys continue forward into Westruun?
Sam: To Westruun. And what is our mission?
Laura: Okay, what are we, what's our plan here, Grog?
Travis: What time is it?
Matt: You guys have traveled for one day, you've gone into the evening, you can take a rest here or, you know, rest within your mansion on the outskirts of this encampment before it roots up and starts heading back to Kymal relatively soon. You guys then, the next morning, can continue your trek northward, and you can probably get to Westruun by the end of day, if you travel quickly and consistently.
Laura: What do you think, Grog, what do you want to do? Walk right into town?
Travis: No. No. I like what Percy said, I think there's worth in being clever.
Taliesin: I would agree.
Travis: I would actually like to maybe run some ideas by you. We don't walk into town, but we have the town walk out to us.
Sam: How do we do that?
Taliesin: Oh, there's many ways we could do that.
Travis: Well, look, so there are people in there that are innocents, right, we told the farmer we'd get his people back and I really want to see if Wilhand's all right. So listen. How do you feel about sending someone in that would draw out their worst?
Taliesin: I think we could draw out their worst very easily. Hmm. How committed are your people to trial by combat?
Travis: Oh, it's about all we do.
Taliesin: What can you imagine would be the most exciting show they could possibly hope for?
Laura: A rematch, I would think.
Travis: Well, it wasn't really an official fight, it was more of like a one-sided ass-whooping.
Laura: But they think you're dead.
Travis: Yeah. We're going to get to that later. I was thinking maybe we could set a fire and send someone running in and say there's a roving band of orcs that are challenging the goliaths, and then when they come out and leave we can move into the town and get all the innocents out. And then if we want, we could set a trap, or an ambush, or we could play some mind games, but I want to try and get the town clear first.
Sam: You know, your people might not be the brightest, but they're not going to send everybody out to meet these orcs.
Travis: No no no no. Just a few.
Marisha: And probably not Kevdak.
Travis: Well, look, if it's not Kevdak, we get a practice round on those that do come out.
Marisha: Well, here's my question  there's got to be hundreds of people still left in Westruun. It could take hours to evacuate a city of that size.
Travis: Well, so you know how last time when we went over there and Horace was just outside the city walls? I'm pretty sure if we wait for a bit, somebody will come out, we take him, we mess him up real good, maybe take his tongue out, chop off his arms, and then send him back in.
Taliesin: Some of that is...
Travis: I mean, I'm open to augmenting that plan a little bit.
Sam: I could make you look like an orc or something.
Travis: No, like I said before, if I go in there--
Sam: No no no, just to rough up the guy that we send back in to tell them about the orcs.
Travis: I'll hold him while somebody else can rough him up, but--
Taliesin: How smart are your people?
Travis: Well, pretty smart, they're all like me.
Laura: As smart as you?
Travis: Yeah, scholars the lot.
Marisha: Grog. If someone kills Kevdak, say hypothetically you, who takes control of the Herd after that?
Travis: Well, my math is a little shoddy, but I think that would be me.
Marisha: Well then, why do we need to evacuate the city if you could theoretically have control over it?
Liam: If we could figure out where Kevdak is and drop in on that point.
Laura: Well, he's in the mayor's--
Liam: Yeah. And handle Kevdak before the rest of the city can descend upon us. It's a gamble, but so is everything we do.
Laura: Yeah, but if the city, if the rest of them don't see him defeating Kevdak, then it's worthless. They need to watch it happen.
Liam: Well, how honorable are your people, if you fell Kevdak or whatever the fuck his name is, will the rest stand down?
Travis: Maybe, but-- (sighs) So, here it is. My whole life has been wanting to punish or get back at Kevdak. I don't want to do it cheaply, I don't want to do it quickly. I want to do it with my own hands. Now, I'll do it with my family, do it with my buddy Pike, but I want it done right.
Taliesin: I've got a thought. It's dangerous, but I have a thought. You literally walk, march right to the city gates and demand a challenge.
Marisha: I have a feeling you're going to be the most attractive bait that we can think of.
Taliesin: If we put you right in front there, perhaps we let Pike stay with you, I doubt there's any of them who will not want to watch that. And while they're watching, the rest of us do our best to get everybody as safe as possible.
Laura: But what's to keep Grog safe in the meantime?
Taliesin: They won't want to sully that fight, no one will want to sully that fight.
Travis: No, I can guarantee you, no one will interfere.
Taliesin: And if things get bad--
Marisha: We'll be nearby.
Taliesin: We'll pull him out.
Travis: I like that.
Laura: I don't want to abandon Grog to a fight with Kevdak while we're freeing villagers. No offense to them. I want to have Grog's back.
Liam: I agree with that.
Marisha: I think we won't need to worry about freeing the villagers if we can defeat Kevdak.
Laura: What if we stay hidden?
Travis: Oh, wait a minute. Right, so they think I'm dead.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Maybe I let them think I conquered death.
Laura: Which you kind of did, Grog.
Travis: Maybe we let them think that I'm not the same Grog I was before. Maybe we let them think I've gained abilities.
Marisha: I'm pretty sure all those things are actually true.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, but I mean like--
Sam: Yeah, yeah, make a show of it a bit.
Travis: Yeah. But they don't have to see where those abilities come from.
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: All they've got to see is me. There are roofs, right, I mean it's like two- and three-story buildings all in that city.
Ashley: It just makes me so nervous.
Laura: So wait, we stay hidden and you call lightning.
Travis: Yeah. You guys get all up on the roofs while I'm making a scene in the middle and we pull off the greatest stage show there's ever been.
Sam: I love a good stage show.
Ashley: This is not a bad idea.
Marisha: We can make you look as cool as you want. That's undeniable.
Travis: If I do a pelvic thrust, will you do your--
Sam: I will grant you cock lightning.
Travis: Holy shit. "I will grant you cock lightning."
Liam: Weirdest production of Grease ever.
Taliesin: How many objects are you attuned to right now?
Travis: Three.
Sam: If he could unattune to one, we can put him in the Hat of Disguise.
Travis: I don't want it.
Taliesin: What do you have right now?
Travis: I have the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength.
Taliesin: That's good.
Travis: I have the flaming--
Laura: Warhammer?
Travis: Yup.
Taliesin: That's good.
Travis: And the belt. What's the other? Oh, and my--
Laura: You gained the ability to grow a beard in the afterlife. It's pretty major.
Matt: Well, you have three of those, so you have to get rid of the necklace.
Travis: Actually, the flaming warhammer's not attuned.
Matt: Oh, that's right. That's true, no, you're good.
Taliesin: What does the amulet do?
Travis: It gives me plus two to my AC.
Marisha: Pretty nice.
Taliesin: That's pretty nice.
Sam: And so the object of this would be to stall, to enthrall, to captivate them as long as you can, keep talking to them, not engage in fights for as long as possible while we--
Travis: Get in place. I mean, I could try and do it while you're getting the hostages out, or we could just take down the snake's head.
Taliesin: We need his Knuckles.
Laura: Kill Kevdak.
Sam: Yeah, but is Kevdak going to engage in a fight with a magical Grog? That's not a fair fight, is it?
Laura: It's a pride issue.
Ashley: I think he will.
Travis: I do know how to get his pride in check.
Laura: Grog, would you engage in a fight with a magical being who wronged you, if you thought you were better than him?
Travis: Why, who said something?
Sam: And when they discover, and they surely will, that you are not magical and that your friends are aiding you, will that bring you great shame?
Travis: No. No, I made a choice. This is my family. My old family left me to die.
Marisha: Plus, I mean, it's like wearing really cool robes. Right, Scanlan? You know, there's nothing wrong with wanting to look cool.
Sam: I don't know about wanting to look cool, it just comes naturally.
Ashley: Let's make sure that it doesn't happen, that they won't know.
Laura: Nice beret there, Scanlan.
Taliesin: This is going to end with a fight between the two of you, there's no denying that.
Liam: Anyway, Kevdak's using a gift of the gods.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: That's right! He's full of shit.
Ashley: These are very scary people, you guys. They left him in a very horrible state and I would not like to see that again.
Marisha: But that was years ago!
Taliesin: We defeated the people who left me in a horrible state, I think we will have no problem defeating the people who left him.
Liam: We have a gift of the gods and soon we will have many more.
Sam: So you do intend to engage in a fight. Because otherwise I would say, I can go in, just sort of looking like you, and draw their attention.
Taliesin: And then what?
Sam: And then bamf outta there.
Taliesin: But then what?
Sam: Or run away and draw them with me.
Taliesin: How does that save the city?
Sam: It gets them to follow me.
Travis: Yeah, I mean, and either way, I like that because either way, if only the pawns of the group follow him out? That's fewer goliaths we have to worry about. Best-case scenario, Kevdak, Zanror, and the best of the baddies chase him out, we can get the hostages out, and then set the trap for when they come back.
Taliesin: It's not just the hostages, though, it's a city under siege. I just don't think it's feasible to empty it.
Marisha: Right, but you have to remember it's-- right, yes, pretty much. What you said. It's a city under siege, under siege, it's meta under siege, under siege from the goliaths and then again from the dragons.
Taliesin: They're in a place, though, where if we can get rid of the goliaths, at least they could function with the dragons.
Laura: And if we remove all of the villagers, it'll definitely gain the attention of the dragons.
Marisha: That's true.
Travis: Will it? I thought they only fly over every few days.
Marisha: They have wyverns who have been running patrol.
Travis: Not over Westruun.
Taliesin: Not over Westruun.
Marisha: But we haven't been hanging out over Westruun.
Travis: If there are no wyverns, are you open to the idea of gerbil-ball Scanlan doing a thing?
Marisha: No, not at all. But that's actually not a bad idea. We're still outside the camp, right? How about this: why don't we hike to the outskirts of Westruun, camp out the rest of the evening, keep an eye out, and just scout for a little bit?
Travis: Yeah, and if we get close, hopefully we can ask somebody that's nice if they've seen any dragons and how long it's been since.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Well, we probably want to set up shop for a while and wait for the dragons to come and leave and then strike, so that we've got some time.
Taliesin: Very clever.
Travis: That's brilliant.
Liam: We use fake shithead Grog. Sorry. Fake shitheadier Grog to create a scene and run off and draw away some of the goliaths, probably not Kevdak, and then you go in for the main event with a thinned-out Herd.
Travis: Yep. I like it.
Marisha: I can be on the roofs nearby along with Vex and Percy doing range.
Laura: What if we do the same thing that those orcs did? When you go in and cause a distraction and lead them out, we spend the few days that we're waiting for the dragons to build a massive trench, you can use Move Earth, and lead them all out over something and drop a Herd of goliaths.
Marisha: And I can do the Hallucinatory Terrain thing again. It has been a while.
Laura: Drop them into a trench, they're stuck in there while he fights Kevdak.
Marisha: And I do love using that spell.
Travis: I'm game.
Ashley: I like this idea.
Sam: It still doesn't solve one question.
Travis: What's that?
Sam: I love you, but can you beat Kevdak without magic and friends?
Travis: I mean, look, we're going to find out one way or the other. I don't know. But look.
Laura: Can we aid you?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: This isn't like the Crucible.
Travis: No, look, he's wearing weapons given by a god. I don't care if it's a totally fair fight, I just don't want to dispatch him cheaply.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: We can do this. We've got lightning.
Liam: That's very intelligent of you, Grog.
Sam: That means good.
Laura: Smart.
Travis: Oh. Thank you.
Taliesin: Let's rest up and wait for the dragons.
Marisha: All right, so we're going to hike to the outskirts of Westruun.
Matt: Okay. You guys, during this journey, find your way northward. Are you skirting around the west side like you did when you first arrived?
Laura: Sure?
Matt: All right.
Laura: We're keeping a good distance, as we get closer, so it lasts, I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Travis: We have that really nice high grass, right?
Matt: It was like waist-high or so.
Travis: Not like cornstalk high.
Matt: There were areas where there was, like during the thick farmland, there are areas where they have high-stalk.
Travis: I'd like to stay there, I'd like to stay in those areas.
Matt: Okay, so you'll be pretty much dodging from farmland to farmland, on the outside. I need you all to roll stealth checks, if you could?
Laura: Add ten because I cast Pass Without a Trace.
Ashley: I'm going to use, oh no. Because that won't be enough time.
Sam: Come on, Pikey.
Travis: That's good.
Laura: That's really good. Plus ten.
Ashley: Plus ten?
Laura: Yeah, because I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Travis: 19. Oh. 29.
Ashley: 24.
Laura: 33.
Liam: 30.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 23.
Sam: 20.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: We're quiet.
Travis: He rolled anyway.
Matt: All right, as you guys leap into the high grass, moving around the outside of Westruun, eyes peeled, as the sun sets and the night kicks in, you try your best to watch for any patrols that are keeping an eye. Make a perception check.
Travis: 13.
Sam: 16.
Marisha: 19.
Taliesin: 20.
Liam: 22.
Laura: 32.
Ashley: 23.
Matt: All right. The three of you guys glance over and you do see there is a patrol of three individuals, one of which appears to be goliath in nature, the other two humanoid of some degree. In the distance, it's hard to see this far away. And they're patrolling the same area where you guys came through before. It appears like the patrol has increased, like there's a mildly heightened state of awareness that something bad went down recently. However, you stay far enough away and out of sight, they do not catch visual on you and eventually you get enough distance northward where you feel like they haven't really noticed.
Travis: Did we pass the area that we were at before, where the farmer, Frederick?
Matt: Yeah, you passed that area, yeah.
Travis: Did we see him?
Matt: You did not see him, no.
Laura: Was his name Frederick? No, it was with an 'r'.
Sam: Can we go to that place?
Travis: Reggie. Reginald, sorry.
Sam: Can we sneak there, can Vax sneak there? What was the man's name who we killed?
Laura: Oh, that you killed?
Travis: Horace.
Sam: No no no, the goliath.
Travis: Horace.
Sam: Vax, can you go get Horace's head?
Taliesin: Okay, that's a good idea.
Liam: Yeah, I can get that.
Taliesin: I take that back, that's a great idea.
Liam: I don't know why, but I can get that.
Matt: So you're heading forward to do that?
Laura: I rolled a better stealth than him, though.
Matt: Make a new stealth check. As you guys hold back and you--
Laura: Oh, that's so much better! No, it's good.
Liam: 39.
Matt: 39, okay. So as you guys wait in the back, staying low to the grass, you watch as Vax dives into the field and vanishes. You, darting in a forward way, find your way to the outside of the initial crop-grid. There does not appear to be any guards that are watching this property. You recall the various avenues you guys utilized in systematically making your way from path to path. It takes you a few minutes, but you manage to find an area that looks familiar enough where you find your way into the center of one of the crop lanes where the corpse of Horace recently was. Roll a perception check.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27. You get there and you glance about. But the body's gone.
Liam: Fuck.
Matt: Body's not there, it's taken. You start following the trail, you see where maybe it was dragged off. Make a survival roll.
Liam: Survival roll? Well, I'm going to use Luck, because I slept. Yeah. 18.
Matt: 18, okay, so you find signs of his body being dragged and you start trying to find the direction it was taken. You dart along, once again keeping within the crops as best you can to stay out of sight. You make your way out of the northern side of it before the trail disappears. You do not know where the body was taken, other than north and outward. You glance over and all you see is the original farmhouse where Reginald was living, there's the crops out there, there's the big scarecrow that was in the center. There wasn't a scarecrow before. You look over real close and you see, strung up across a haphazard wooden spike, arms out, is the currently being pecked apart body of Reginald, who apparently suffered the brunt of the discovery of Horace's corpse in the time that has transpired since you last left Westruun.
Liam: Do I sense anything around?
Matt: At the moment? No. The patrol's probably a good ten minutes before it's seeming, because it's headed in the direction where you are but you don't know, probably take ten or 15 minutes before they reach where you are.
Liam: I'm going to stealth up to the body. Cut him down.
Matt: Okay. Cut the ropes off, he slumps down.
Liam: I shoulder him back to the group.
Matt: Okay. Make a stealth check with disadvantage.
Liam: 20.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 25. 35.
Matt: Okay. Though he wasn't a very heavy individual, and especially now that he's been out to dry for at least a couple days, most of the bloat has worn off and the-- not going into graphic detail, elements of the corpse have been left behind. You bring most of him with you through the grass over to the rest of the group. You guys watch as Vax pulls his way up out of the grass, carrying over his shoulder the lifeless body of Reginald.
Liam: Let's all talk about repercussions. And I lay him out.
Taliesin: Well, they know we're here now.
Travis: Do they?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: I think they thought it was him.
Liam: They did not think the farmer killed Horace.
Travis: We should've sent him off to the camp.
Taliesin: They know we're here now because now his body's missing.
Sam: Also, I assume they tortured him before they killed him.
Taliesin: I don't know if they're that clever.
Sam: Can you talk to the dead?
Liam: These people were in a shit situation, while I don't blame us entirely for this because of where they live now, we must not do anything we're doing lightly. There are many lives at stake, not just Reginald's. Let's just not flit about, here, let's take this seriously, please.
Taliesin: Should've left him up there.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: Should've cut him down tomorrow. One more day up there would have made no difference to him, and it's going to make a difference to us because we have to move tonight now.
Marisha: Maybe it's a matter of respect, Percy.
Taliesin: Respect him by freeing his daughter.
Travis: I agree.
Laura: They know we're here.
Taliesin: They know we're here.
Laura: They're going to see he's missing.
Marisha: I think they already knew we were here.
Taliesin: I don't think they did.
Travis: I don't think they did either.
Liam: Scanlan, can you make a fake stupid body, can you make a scarecrow?
Sam: Not really. Not really.
Liam: Can any of us?
Laura: I can fashion something.
Taliesin: No, tonight's fine. There's nothing wrong with tonight. I just figure, if we do it, and we should do it, and obviously this is nothing if not a sign that we should've done it sooner.
Sam: Why don't we just burn the whole field? They won't know if there's a body in there or not.
Taliesin: That was our reasoning last time, no, we do this, I think we do this tonight.
Marisha: We do this tonight?
Ashley: I could cast Speak with Dead and we could ask him some questions.
Sam: We could.
Ashley: We could ask him up to five questions.
Sam: Let's do it.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: So you guys quietly press down in a small area of grass to give you enough of a space for you to go ahead and perform this ritual. As you lay the body down, you look up to the sky and where some of the cloud cover that is slowly drawing over the area, there's a little gap in the clouds, and as you look up to the now-visible stars, you whisper Sarenrae's name, look down at the body, touch it with your hand, and the still corpse, the chest begins to rise and fall with an unnatural breath for the time being. The eyes begin to twitch and move around. No physical movement beyond that, but the mouth slowly draws open and you hear, while the lips do not move, you hear a voice emanate through like an exhale. "You returned."
Laura: Reginald. We're so sorry.
Matt: "I knew what I was getting into. Do not fret or blame."
Laura: We will rescue your daughter.
Travis: Five questions. Vax. Make it count.
Taliesin: Do they know we're coming?
Liam: Me?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I think we can all ask.
Liam: Reginald, how much do your murderers know? About us?
Matt: "I told them it was me. They should not and could not know your intent to return."
Sam: Can he describe the one who did it?
Liam: Go ahead, Scanlan.
Sam: Hi. Sorry. The ones who did you in. Other than large and pale, were there any distinguishing marks or names thrown about?
Matt: "They brought me to one of their leaders. Half-tattooed face and brow and rags. His jaw, once broken, pushes to one side. I know not the name."
Travis: Do I understand that description?
Matt: You recall the tattoo, and you recall the moment the jaw was broken.
Travis: I was wondering.
Matt: This was Zanror.
Sam: This was who?
Travis: Kevdak's son.
Liam: He broke it. Grog broke it.
Laura: Oh shit.
Taliesin: What are the things that we face inside the city? What should we fear inside the city?
Matt: "Fear those that are fueled by rage, skilled with weapons, and those that call the elements their own. And the dragon does come."
Travis: Does come. One more question, can we ask if he's seen the dragon or how long it's been?
Sam: Go ahead.
Travis: We thank you for your time. If we may, how long has it been since the dragon was last here?
Matt: "Two days."
Laura: It's coming tomorrow.
Travis: Two days, it's coming back. Okay.
Laura: That means tomorrow it's coming back.
Sam: We can wait another day. How many more questions?
Laura: Is that it, or one more?
Sam: No, we get five.
Taliesin: We have one more if we want it.
Sam: What would you like us to tell your daughter?
Matt: "Tell her that my life was given so she could live hers. And my memory lives in her eyes." And with that, the head just lolls back a little bit, the jaw hangs open, the last of the breath in the chest (exhales) and the magic fades.
Taliesin: Vax. We have to put it back.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: They don't know we're here. It could be anyone who could've cut him down. Why would they suspect us? I would suspect the village people first.
Travis: I would too, and I'm the smartest of them all.
Laura: Which is actually worse. We need to put something back up. I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
Taliesin: He's going to save his daughter one last time, we're going to put him back up for one day. We're going to wait for the dragon to pass, and then he will be buried on his land properly with stone and dirt.
Liam: Yes. I'll take him. Yes.
Taliesin: Thank you. And thank you for bringing him. This was helpful.
Ashley: Can we give him a proper burial?
Travis: No, we're going to put him back up.
Ashley: We're going to put him back up, that's what you. Sorry.
Matt: Vax, are you taking the corpse back? Stealth check with disadvantage.
Liam: Disadvantage.
Matt: Yeah, carrying him along, man.
Liam: Oh, it's all right, though, 35.
Taliesin: Jesus Christ.
Matt: Rogues. Coming back, as you approach the outside you can see now the patrol has skirted by and you have to wait patiently, but not wait too long because you know you have about a 30-second window before they will come into sight of this farmstead. Using that, you dart forward, take the body, thrust it up, trying to catch-- I want you to go ahead and make a dexterity check to see how fast you can utilize what rope is at your disposal.
Liam: Just straight dexterity? 17.
Matt: 17. With that, you throw the body up, look over your shoulder, grab out, pull out bits of twine you have, a piece of rope or a piece of your shirt that you (tearing noise) tear off to the side, and fashion a quick knot over one arm and the other, you look over your shoulder again, you can see the shadow of them beginning to just turn around the side, you get the other arm up, just manage to slump it over the wood. You know there isn't any more time, and with that you duck back underneath the grass and vanish. He's haphazardly up and one arm is not actually tied, it's just kind of laid over it, but he's currently back on the wooden stake, across.
Liam: Better than what it was.
Matt: As you dart back and slowly return to your group, glancing over in that direction, the patrol doesn't seem to take notice and continues walking past.
Travis: So am I the only one that, while we wait, is itching for a fight?
Laura: Grog.
Travis: I'm sorry, look, it's just who I am.
Sam: Well listen, if you want a fight, we could still use one of their heads. We could find one of those patrolmen walking around, grab him, take his head.
Taliesin: Too soon.
Travis: Too soon.
Marisha: Did we not just learn anything?
Liam: We're going to be fighting soon enough. I think everyone should hide inside your love shack and my sister and I should wait here in the grass and watch and wait. And when the dragon comes, we alert you all.
Taliesin: We wait for a dragon pass. The day after the dragon passes, we strike.
Laura: I agree.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: Let's go.
Matt: You guys, most of you, other than the twins, head into the magnificent mansion. An evening that is restful by definition but still wracked with tension and anxiety. You guys watch throughout the night, relatively uneventful, though a cool evening. Without building a fire, you both do have to keep bundled up against the elements. It's not cold enough to the point where it's going to be impactful, but it is chilly.
Liam: I fart a lot.
Matt: The farting does keep you warm, Vax.
Taliesin: I want to tinker for the evening as well.
Matt: Make another tinker check.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: 21. Okay. You made headway. You've constructed a portion of the seat and the apparatus that connects it to the broom without interfering with the enchantment. Right now it's testing that and then getting the stirrups and making sure that it's functional and not going to get her killed.
Taliesin: Whatever night we have time, I want to keep poking at that.
Marisha: Can I also spend some time practicing a Protection from Energy potion?
Matt: Want to go ahead and utilize the delightfully presented brewing vicinity in the--
Marisha: I do.
Matt: All right, sure.
Marisha: Not enough to where I can't, you know, sleep, but just, you know.
Taliesin: I'm going to lend her my resist lightning ring so that she can study it and hopefully come up with a resist energy potion.
Matt: Okay. I'll say, what level is that?
Marisha: Protection from Energy is a 3rd-level spell. (musical tone)
Matt: I don't know what that was.
Taliesin: Matt Mercer, white courtesy phone. Matt Mercer, white courtesy phone.
Matt: Now reaching housewares, spell scrolls.
Liam: Kevdak, you are wanted at the front gates.
Matt: Third, that would be an uncommon spell scroll, that would put it, I'd say that'd put it about-- how many gold pieces? I'd say you begin the process of brewing one.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: It'll take you a little while to get that done.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: A few days, at the very least. All right, so.
Sam: Grog. Just before tomorrow and stuff, Kevdak.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: His son is--
Travis: Zanror.
Sam: Zanror.
Travis: It's spelled-- it's spelled like this. And then like it sounds.
Sam: Sure, sure. Standard spelling. What about anyone else I need to know about? Who you were familiar with or had a relationship with?
Travis: Nah. Not any longer.
Sam: All right, so, we're still resting, right?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: So I'm going to knock on Pike's door. (knocking sound)
Ashley: I don't answer. No, I'm just kidding.
Sam: (whispers) I can still get in.
Ashley: Hi, Scanlan.
Sam: Hello. Did you get your robe and everything and your slippers?
Ashley: Oh, yes, slippers and everything.
Sam: The monogram?
Ashley: Yes, it's great, thank you so much. P.T.
Sam: And the scented candles?
Ashley: Yes, it smells so good in here. Thank you.
Sam: Great, great. If you need anything, there's two bells next to your bed, there's one to call servants and there's one for me.
Ashley: Oh, thank you, Scanlan.
Sam: The purple one is mine.
Marisha: Percy and I strategize.
Taliesin: We're doing strategies.
Sam: Great. Listen, there's been a lot of death recently and, well, just, I might die and stuff so, ah. Just don't read this until I do.
Liam: Can I read it?
Laura: Don't!
Ashley: What is this?
Laura: Pass it over.
Liam: Do you want to go steady? If yes, check this box.
Ashley: "Do not open" and in parentheses "(until I'm dead)."
Sam: That's all.
Ashley: Well, hopefully I never have to open this.
Sam: I hope so, too. That's all. Have a good night.
Ashley: Bye, Scanlan.
Sam: Bye.
Liam: (whispers) Secrets.
Ashley: I close the door, I open it, and I read it. (cheering)
Taliesin: I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you!
Travis: Nobody look, nobody look. Don't you look! Don't you look. Don't you look.
Laura: She's full-on reading it!
Sam: You know what? I love her anyway. (laughter)
Ashley: This is a bit of tome, so I think I should wait to read this, but a part of me-- Oh.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You clever fucker. Good god.
Ashley: Oh, man. (gasps)
Laura: Oh, I want to know what it says so fucking bad!
Travis: We got to wait for her to finish, because the night is young.
Sam: It's all dick pics. (laughter)
Laura: The cube. Over and over and over again.
Matt: In the meantime, while you're reading that, you guys are doing what?
Taliesin: We were strategizing. We were just, we're figuring out some strategy for how to make this work.
Matt: Okay, fair enough.
Liam: Dick pics hand-drawn by quill.
Taliesin: By candlelight.
Matt: As the evening progresses, you guys rest, preparing yourselves for the next day. You guys--
Laura: We're still outside.
Matt: You guys are woken up right as the sun begins to rise by the distant sound of (roar, sweeping wings).
Travis: Oh, fuck.
Matt: You shake Vax awake and you guys look up from the grass and you can see, coming down from the very very top of Gatshadow, you see the wings unfurled and with each swoosh down, the gargantuan black dragon streaks down, dive bombs just past the Bramblewood, and scoots over the entire city of Westruun, making its presence known. As it just roars out (roar, sweeping wings), circling over the city twice, three times, as you see lights going on in the city. As it goes over three times, seemingly content that it's made its presence known and asserted its vocal dominance over the vicinity by instilling some early-morning fear in the denizens of this town, the dragon then lands a little bit northwest of the city itself. It's hard to make out exactly what's happening at this distance, but you see it, at its size, circle around an area, scrape into the dirt a bit, take a moment, makes a couple of grumbled (snarls). Takes one of its claws and scoops up a large cart that has apparently a few sacks inside of it. And its wings (sweeping wings). It begins taking up in the air again and you can see now there are three goliaths that are walking away from the point. As the dragon turns and scoops one up in its other claw. And the two others turn around and watch it as it takes off towards the top of the mountain, unable to do anything.
Laura: That's one less fuck we have to worry about.
Matt: Up onto Gatshadow.
Taliesin: So we're watching the other two head back towards the--
Matt: Nobody sees this except for the twins.
Travis: No windows? Okay.
Matt: No, you guys are in another plane. You look out the window and it's just like this purple expanse.
Liam: It seems like a slim thread of hope, but perhaps the underlings are not entirely satisfied with this arrangement? Just scooped one up.
Laura: It's possible. I have a feeling they're having a hard time finding any sort of hoard to offer after this many days.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Fuck.
Liam: It's a long shot, but you told me about those giants.
Laura: Yes?
Liam: When you were with Zahra, and they turned. We shouldn't rely on it.
Laura: It's possible. If Grog can take control of the Herd, they may be able to fight with us. But I wouldn't trust them.
Liam: No.
Laura: We need to tell the others.
Liam: Yep.
Matt: You guys find your way back to the door, entering the mansion. Servants have already, at the sound of you entering, begin to appear out of their spectral, ethereal states, bowing to you, offering to take your coat.
Liam: Chicken, please.
Matt: "Right away, sir." And they drift off to prepare your bountiful breakfast. Eventually you go ahead and begin to muster the rest of your party down towards the breakfast area, and the rest of you come to consciousness and find your way to where the food is being served and Vex and Vax both wait, rather stone-faced, and prepared to speak.
Laura: Well. Dragon came. Not happy. You'll be glad to know, however, that it took one of your Herd away with it.
Taliesin: I imagine the offering was a little light.
Laura: Yes, that's what I think as well.
Travis: From the three that were walking around?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: What did the other two do?
Laura: Not much. What are you going to do when a dragon comes and takes someone away? Stand there and watch, really.
Liam: Your buddy Horace made it sound like it was easy street, but I don't know if that's entirely accurate.
Travis: We can use that.
Laura: They may not be very happy with the dragon right now. They may not care at all.
Taliesin: They may not be very happy with leadership that leaves them in a place where they're being taken advantage of. That's very clever. Might be time to move on.
Sam: Move on? Move in?
Taliesin: For them to leave.
Sam: Oh, for them to move on.
Taliesin: This is not a good deal for them anymore.
Laura: So we start today, yes?
Taliesin: I think it starts today.
Marisha: I think it starts right now.
Sam: Want to go in?
Travis: Well, I haven't had my morning shit yet, but as soon as I do--
Laura: While Grog shits, I'm just going to take a little nap, while he's shitting, it takes a while usually, right?
Marisha: Sure, yeah, yeah.
Liam: Same, same.
Taliesin: He'll play Candy Crush.
Laura: Something to recover a little bit of time.
Sam: Want me to guard the door?
Travis: I don't think I need it this time. (laughter)
Laura: I'll be right back.
Travis: What, you really got to go?
Laura: Oh no. Blocked.
Sam: She's going to go take a shit.
Laura: Don't say that!
Liam: Laura doesn't shit!
Sam: No, she doesn't.
Travis: All right. Yeah, then we do it. And we do it the way we said. Right?
Sam: You want me to go in, draw out as many as I can, but wait, no, first we have to prepare a trap, don't we? Isn't there a trap to be prepared?
Marisha: Yes, I can dig a trench pretty quickly, honestly, if we want to go the trench route? Is that we were thinking?
Travis: Now here's the thing. Sorry.
Sam: You need to be inside the city gates as well.
Travis: Well, hold on, what were you going to say?
Ashley: No, I, go.
Travis: So if we try and build that trench outside, right, we risk being seen and then pop goes the weasel. If you go in--
Sam: While I'm in, you can build the trench.
Travis: Well, what, can you go in looking like me, or can you go in looking like me on fire?
Sam: Go in and what?
Travis: Can you conjure just me, or could you be me as a walking flame?
Sam: Hmm, that would be harder. Yeah, that would be harder to do, to pull off, you're big. You're pretty big.
Travis: Oh I know, this is like a one-time thing for me, so I figured I'd just do it rockstar. I just want to see what it looks like.
Sam: If someone else set me on literal fire, I could, but I wouldn't--
Travis: We'll stand down from that idea, it was just a thought, no problem.
Taliesin: There's no bad idea when we're workshopping.
Sam: Spitballing, spitballing.
Travis: If we want to do the trench, we have to wait for nightfall.
Sam: I was going to make myself look like you, but a dead version of you. A zombified Grog.
Travis: I'm all right with that. Can I hear your best undead Grog?
Sam: (Grog voice) Right. So. Right so I'm. Ugh, I'm so dead.
Liam: Maybe you don't say anything. (laughter)
Sam: No, no, I just have to warm up, ah, mimimimi, right, right, rrrr. Cor, all right then, I've been dead for about five, six years.
Travis: It's amazing, it's like a verbal mirror. So, if we do the trench, though, we have to-- Percy--
Marisha: I could theoretically dig the trench possibly without anybody noticing, like tunnel underground and just tunnel it out and maybe even, you know. Leave like a thin layer of dirt, possibly? I dunno. Maybe.
Liam: Like Dig Dug.
Marisha: Like Dig Dug. Exactly the same thing.
Sam: Wait, can't you just shape earth without affecting the surface of it, I mean, can't you just shape the underneath of it?
Marisha: That's what I'm saying.
Sam: No one will even see it being moved.
Marisha: And I could possibly maybe carve it thin enough to where when they run over it it'll collapse.
Travis: Percy, what was your idea?
Taliesin: And mix a little black powder into the dirt.
Marisha: Well, I was also hoping, oh, and explode it as they run by--
Taliesin: Hit it with lightning and it'll go up.
Marisha: Also, if we could maybe have something fancy at the bottom of it to, you know. Finish them off.
Taliesin: Do we have something fancy to put at the bottom?
Sam: We have a bear.
Travis: If we do the ditch for the people that're coming out of the city, we waste it if it's not Zanror and Kevdak. If we go in--
Laura: At least it gets them out of commission.
Marisha: Yeah, I thought the trench was to thin the herd.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Literally.
Laura: Good. I like it.
Sam: So, wait, is there a gate to the city?
Matt: There are multiple entrances to the city. The few that you've seen are guarded with outward-facing defensive spikes and pikes that are set up to prevent any sort of like cavalry entry or just as a warning.
Liam: I have a question.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: For Grog. (crash in the background)
Sam: (laughs) What the hell's going on there tonight?
Liam: We fought your father and he was dead. What's the last thing the Herd has heard of your father?
Travis: I don't know. Last thing I remember, I was looking up at my father. And the rest of my Herd. He made no move to save me.
Liam: Well. I don't know how he got there, but we saved you from your father and the dead guy deep underground, so they lost him at some point. What if instead of Grog, you appeared as Grog's dad?
Sam: I don't know what Grog's dad looks like.
Liam: Yes you do, you fought him. He was a rotting corpse in front of you trying to kill you.
Travis: Way back in the beginning.
Sam: Of course. How could I forget? (laughter)
Liam: Make yourself look like that, I'm not exactly sure what that would do.
Taliesin: It could be interesting.
Liam: It could be interesting.
Marisha: I mean, it could also further instill Grog being powerful and undead.
Taliesin: Yes, that's actually even better.
Laura: If he brought his father back to fight underneath him.
Marisha: With him, right, like he's a necromancer.
Liam: And Kevdak would think that Grog's father was serving him.
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: And he wouldn't feel pissy if he saw one Grog do a magic trick and then the other Grog sprang up and said, "Fight me instead." It would seem more real.
Sam: What was your dad's name?
Liam: Larry?
Taliesin: Curly.
Marisha: Moe.
Matt: Do you remember? It was Stonejaw. So Stonejaw Strongjaw. (laughter)
Liam: Wow.
Sam: That's a terrible name!
Taliesin: That's embarrassing.
Laura: Wow.
Liam: That's like George Foreman IV.
Laura: He had an intelligence of four.
Matt: I know, yeah.
Travis: It's a repressed memory, all right?
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: He comes up never.
Liam: This is George Foreman.
Liam: This is also George Foreman. These three guys are also George Foreman.
Marisha: This is also George Foreman. These three guys are also George Foreman.
Matt: Other brother Darryl.
Taliesin: All right. So I say you, your dad, and maybe Pike walk up to the front door and then we get ready to hit them with the doozy once things start.
Marisha: All right, give me a little bit of time to dig a ditch.
Taliesin: No Pike?
Travis: No. If I walk in, I want to walk in on my own.
Laura: So this is only your fake father walking up at this point.
Travis: As the distraction, right?
Laura: Yes.
Laura: Done.
Taliesin: You're going to lure them out and we're going to hit them when they come out.
Sam: Okay, but wait. I've got to bring them out of a specific gate where there's going to be a trap and if you go in and rescue any other civilians, you have to bring them out through a different gate that doesn't have a trap at it.
Marisha: We're not going to worry about that.
Taliesin: We're not going to evacuate several thousand people, it's just not going to happen.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: We're going to kill Kevdak. He's going to kill Kevdak.
Sam: All right. I'm ready to do this except for a few holes in our plan.
Travis: Yeah, go ahead.
Sam: I don't run very fast. (laughter)
Sam: Maybe if I Polymorph as a goliath, I would have their speed, right?
Ashley: What if you borrow my boots that levitate? Then you can--
Sam: I can't move myself, though, I couldn't just, I would be the Dread Pirate Roberts.
Matt: There will be no survivors.
Ashley: All right, all right, bad idea.
Sam: But if I am Polymorphed as a goliath, would I gain their-- all their abilities and--
Matt: Their movement speed, yes.
Sam: Intelligence?
Matt: Yeah. It's everything--
Taliesin: So why not just look like them and if you need to you can make a bubble?
Liam: You know what would make you move pretty fast is a lady rogue with a flying broom.
Laura: That's true, I could be hiding behind you and drag you.
Taliesin: Could have a rope tied to him.
Matt: However, Polymorph is any beast form, if I recall.
Sam: It can't be a man? He's not a beast, that guy?
Matt: A "beast." Yeah, this, you'd be looking at more of an illusion-based spell like Alter Self.
Sam: Oh, well I don't have that. Oh, I have the hat, but it doesn't make me grow, does it?
Matt: No, you'd be a very, very tiny goliath.
Liam: Maybe they'd think it was perspective fuckery like in the Lord of the Rings movies.
Sam: Well, backup plan, I can go in as dead Reginald.
Liam: His dad is much better.
Sam: They killed him, they just killed him, Kevdak's son killed him, Kevdak's son knows who he is.
Marisha: No. They don't care.
Sam: Sure he does, they just killed him two days ago.
Taliesin: Can you remember who you killed two days ago?
Sam: I can, I remember all of them because I barely kill anybody.
Taliesin: Oh, well, that's fair. I don't think they care who he is.
Travis: Right.
Taliesin: I think you showing up at the front doors is the best option at this point.
Marisha: Scanlan, can you do it with an illusion instead of an actual, physical person? Just an illusion?
Sam: My illusions are small in size. I mean, I could just go in as hey, I'm Mr. Scanlan, come chase after me.
Travis: This is your trick. You pick.
Laura: You could be a fucking triceratops again, for all--
Sam: Are they going to chase after a triceratops, though?
Marisha: It could make theoretical sense if you're still undead Stonejaw, because, you know, decomposition I'm sure shrinks you a little bit.
Ashley: What's something that they would chase after?
Liam: Grog.
Travis: Anything that moves.
Marisha: While you guys figure it out, I'm going to start digging a trench.
Taliesin: I'll help. I'm going to get some--
Marisha: No no no, I'm good. I'm good. You stay. I don't want to blow our cover, I'm going to do this all underground.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: So outside of the city I'm going to start digging underground and I'm going to start digging a trench.
Matt: All right. So you're using Move Earth?
Marisha: I'm moving earth, I'm going to go underground. And it lasts up to two hours.
Matt: You're going underground to do it?
Marisha: I want to go underground and tunnel towards--
Matt: Okay, I see, and then create like the trench tunnel underneath, okay.
Marisha: And do-- and I want to make it really thin to where there's a nice thin layer of earth, and then I want to make it really deep.
Matt: Okay, Move Earth is a concentration up to two hours.
Marisha: Uh-huh, and I can concentrate on a 40-square-foot for ten minutes. And each ten minutes I can change it.
Matt: If you're doing a 40-foot square it could be like 20 feet lower for every 40-foot square you can do, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah. Yeah. So real deep.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say over the two-hour period you could create, for a 40-foot square, like a hundred feet deep, 120 feet deep--
Marisha: I want to make sure it's wide enough to cover the whole entrance as well.
Matt: The whole entrance? Okay. So you dig underneath. Stealth check to get close enough. Because in digging, it'll take you most of that duration to dig up to the gate.
Marisha: Uh-huh. Underground.
Matt: Yeah. I'd say, so in order to do this, you have to actually get fairly close before you start digging down there.
Marisha: I rolled a 19.
Matt: 19?
Marisha: And I have a stealth of 11.
Matt: Okay. All right, so. You make your way up there, moving through the grass best you can. The guards that are there are partially (yawns) coming to, you begin to slowly manipulate downward into the ground using a relatively untouched patch of high grass for cover, and pushing your way through. Over the next two hours, you manage to dig a ditch, the width of this entrance is about 40 feet.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So from end to end, if you just go straight down from there at 20 feet per section every ten minutes, looking at 240 feet deep if you wanted to go the full, although, actually, having to tunnel underneath would probably take-- we'll say 180 feet.
Marisha: 180 feet. That'll do.
Laura: Oh my god, that's amazing.
Marisha: And I can make the ground thin enough to where it's not going to support weight, yeah?
Matt: Yeah, you give yourself enough of a buffer where yeah, you could, might require a bit of a jolt, make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Ah, jeez Louise. Ooh. 19.
Matt: Okay. You feel pretty confident that you've left just enough of a surface that it would support a little bit of weight and maintain its placement. But upon the weight of maybe two humanoid-sized individuals, it would probably crumble beneath.
Marisha: Cool. Cool cool cool. Did I get a little black powder from you?
Taliesin: I did, I gave you a little bit of black powder.
Marisha: Can I put a little black powder in the top of the dirt?
Matt: What is a little bit?
Marisha: Whatever he gave me.
Taliesin: I have a little bit left over. I gave her a third of a barrel worth, like twice this.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So I pepper it in the top, where if it gets hit it's going to go boom.
Taliesin: I'm going to have to deal with it eventually, but I'm fine at the moment.
Matt: Okay. All right. You pepper it on the earth from underneath. Okay.
Marisha: Maybe it works. Maybe. I don't know.
Taliesin: If it's hit by lightning it should be fine.
Marisha: Okay, okay.
Liam: So Grog's father's too big for you, what about the undead severed head of Grog's father?
Sam: I can make an image of that.
Liam: Floating about in the air with Pike's boots.
Laura: Oh my gosh, a floating severed head?
Liam: Saying nasty, nasty, nasty things at the Herd.
Sam: I can do that.
Travis: But he can't move if he's wearing the boots.
Taliesin: He'll be tied to a rope. You can make it move when it's time.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Could you pull him like a balloon?
Sam: I can make the head move.
Marisha: Can you be a floating head inside of a hamster ball?
Sam: I wouldn't need to be the head, I mean, I can't make my body look like a head.
Liam: You can't? I thought you could do anything.
Laura: But you can make the illusion of a head talking.
Sam: I can make the illusion of a head talking. Wizard of Oz-style.
Liam: Can it follow you about?
Marisha: Well, he can be on a roof.
Sam: It would be within 60 feet of me, I think.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: Minor Illusion, I guess.
Matt: Minor Illusion, you could, it's a very minor illusion.
Sam: I know.
Matt: But you could make noise escape from the vicinity of where the head is.
Taliesin: Could I assist with that?
Sam: Because he has Minor Illusion as well.
Matt: If you're close enough to it, it's possible.
Sam: I could also do-- these goliaths, they don't like wyverns. I could be a wyvern.
Laura: The head is so perfect.
Liam: You could be a whole wyvern, but you can't be a goliath?
Sam: It's not a beast, apparently.
Matt: Yeah. Polymorph-- there are higher-level spells that can let you it, but they're a little out of your range.
Sam: A wyvern is a beast?
Taliesin: Okay, we can do the head.
Laura: The head. Be a head! Be a giant, floating, severed head, I like it.
Taliesin: Can you get me out of there once they come to attack?
Laura: Me?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: I mean, I can use the tether and tie you to the broom.
Taliesin: I'll be the bait.
Matt: A wyvern is a dragon, it is not a beast.
Sam: Huh?
Matt: A wyvern is a dragon, it is not a beast.
Sam: I cannot be a wyvern.
Taliesin: I can be the bait.
Marisha: With the hat? With your hat?
Ashley: How are you going to be the bait?
Sam: Yeah, how are you going to be the bait?
Taliesin: I'm going to have the severed head of your father talking to them.
Sam: Yes, I can do that too, and I can escape. You can't.
Taliesin: Up to you. All right.
Laura: Do it.
Liam: Do it, Scanlan, do it.
Laura: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: I mean, I can try. Might be shit. How are you going to hide?
Travis: Can I ask this? Let's say we pick this gate where she's digging out this ditch. What is the terrain like on the outside of the wall next to that gate?
Matt: Because of the building, or the structure of it for about 30 feet on the outside of the wall it's mainly just hard-packed dirt and earth from patrols for hundreds of years going around the wall, whether it be carts, beasts of burden, or just people walking all around the outskirts of the town of Westruun, it's very heavy-packed and often-walked earth.
Travis: Zero cover.
Matt: Zero coverage within 30 feet of it, and the grass does thin as it gets close to that. Keyleth had to pick a specific area and get low and even then had to force her way under and use a good, you know, a quarter of her spell time to be able to dig well enough to get past that space.
Travis: Past 30 feet from the wall, from the edge of town, what kind of cover is there? Is there any?
Matt: Not really.
Travis: Not even the tall grass?
Matt: The grass at that point gets about waist- to knee-high, even less so.
Travis: This is an important thing we need to remember. As we're doing all this, let's just assume that we're us and this'll all go tits-up real quick. We're going to be a fucking long way away from you before we can come to help.
Sam: That's why you're going to send Pike with me. No, I'm just kidding, I would never.
Liam: No, but my sister or I could go with you. One of us.
Sam: That would make me feel quite nice.
Taliesin: Sister's good for an escape route.
Travis: We should at least find a forward operating base, a place where we can watch this unfold from cover and figure out how far away we are from the first act of our show.
Taliesin: Well, if everything goes wrong we meet back here at the very least.
Marisha: I mean, theoretically we'll be stationed throughout, and we'll have our earpieces, correct?
Taliesin: Yeah, but I'm just talking about, what if we have to para-rescue his ass out of a fucking pickle?
Taliesin: That's what Vex is for.
Laura: I'm standing nearby on my broom. I'll fly in and pick him up. He can Dimension Door out, though, very quickly.
Marisha: I also have both of my beast shaping, still, so I can always fly in and evac you.
Travis: How far away are we from the entrance now?
Matt: As you guys have plotted this, and Keyleth has come back to you through the grass after creating this tunnel, I'd say you're about 150, 200 feet out.
Taliesin: That's perfect.
Sam: And we know Westruun.
Matt: Yeah, you know it well.
Sam: And I know how far away from the center of town are we--
Travis: Wait a minute, are there sewers in Westruun?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: It's okay.
Travis: I don't know.
Taliesin: We have that option if it comes to it.
Travis: Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
Taliesin: It's all right. And again, like any good plan, everything will go wrong.
Laura: Yes.
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: Let's do it!
Taliesin: It's time.
Matt: The grass dies, begins to die away, and become in-- not helpful for stealth about 80, 70-80 feet outside the wall.
Marisha: Can we get a Pass Without a Trace while we all get to our positions?
Laura: Fuck yeah.
Matt: Okay. Pass Without a Trace, even so, you can't stealth in the open. In order to stealth, you have to have some way of staying out of sight. Once you get to about 70 feet from the wall, it's basically just open ground and the large wall that surrounds Westruun.
Marisha: I could give us a fog cloud.
Laura: Can you dig a hole under and we can hang out in a hole with something over top of it so we can bust up out, like shallow ground?
Marisha: I've already burned it. I mean, we can still go underground, I have a tunnel built to a certain point.
Laura: But we have to be able to get out of it.
Taliesin: Let's just keep our distance, let's get them out of the castle and coming out at us.
Laura: Okay. And then we go in.
Matt: Okay. So. What's the plan? Who's doing what?
Sam: I go invisible and start walking into town.
Laura: We stay at the very edge, stealthed as fuck.
Taliesin: You're not going into town, why are you going into town? We dug a giant pit in front of the main entrance.
Marisha: Yeah, everyone be mindful of the pit, I point it out to everyone where the pit is so we can go around it.
Matt: Okay. To be fair, yeah, and he is a gnome. He is not a very heavy individual. And you were pretty spot-on-- You're fairly certain it can support the weight of a gnome.
Marisha: I can Polymorph a couple people. No. Sorry. I can Polymorph one person as a stealth kind of deal.
Matt: There are the three guards there, about 20 feet in from the main gate, or the main entranceway, one of which appears to be a female goliath, muscular scar-based torso, very thick, dark, dreaded hair that's pulled tightly to the back of her head and hangs down to the mid-back, and you see two humans that are also as rugged-looking, possibly members of the secondary tribe that they adopted, as was mentioned when you first inquired about the tribe as it currently stands, the Herd. They're all just looking out, bored, one of them is chewing on some dried meat, and they're just keeping an eye out. Scanlan, you've gone invisible and you're approaching the front gate. What are you doing?
Sam: Hey, can you cast Pass Without a Trace on me?
Laura: I already did!
Sam: Okay, good. I'm just going to walk in, straight into town.
Matt: Okay. Yeah. Just for the sake of this, go ahead and make a stealth check. With advantage.
Sam: With advantage.
Matt: Yeah, they have very little chance to even notice.
Sam: So 16 plus--
Laura: Ten.
Sam: Plus two. So 28.
Matt: Yeah. Given the circumstance that you're invisible and that advantage roll, even the quietness of your footsteps, you manage to literally walk within five feet of them without them noticing. You hear some low mutters, some of it's just like broken words, "Stupid hungry--" And the larger female goliath is like, "Shut up. Eyes peeled. I hate this." They look very unhappy about having to be stuck there at this watch. So you've moved past them, now.
Sam: All right, I'm going to go into the-- just the center. We had a scouting party go in and see that-- yes we did, yes we did. It was the center of town, and that's where the key people were around, milling about.
Matt: Yeah, the very center of town is about a 15-minute walk from the outside of town.
Taliesin: We can hear everything that happens.
Matt: How long does your invisibility last?
Sam: An hour.
Matt: An hour. Okay. You start coasting through the town, you come towards a T-intersection of where the road continues forward and turns to the right, you can see a number of the buildings, just like you saw previously on you guys' journey, some of them are charred and black from fires that have been set. Some of them, you do notice as you pass by, large elements of the buildings have just dissolved, melted down by some sort of chemical reaction. Many buildings still stand. You do see that there are broken barrels and crates in the streets, it looks like a lot of what may have been in storage or being brought around as commerce has been ransacked and raided or relocated. You do see a couple carts that are half-broken or just up on the side, with whatever's on the inside pulled out. You do manage to see a couple of horses that were killed during some altercation that were just left rotting in the middle of the street. There are no people visible on the street. Make a perception check.
Laura: What time is it?
Matt: At this point now? In the two hours for you to do that digging, it's close to 10:30, 11:00 in the morning.
Sam: 13.
Matt: 13. Okay. You keep walking past, you don't notice anything that catches your attention. You keep moving towards the center of the town. You start moving through the religious district of the middle of Westruun. Make another perception check.
Sam: 19.
Taliesin: Plus.
Sam: Nothing.
Matt: 19. You glance by what you knew previously in Westruun as the central church of Erathis there. It's a rather, in comparison to the rest of the town, a gaudy temple. But it has been defiled fairly heavily. You can see paint, mud, or some other substance has been smeared across parts of it, portions of the rock have been pushed over and collapsed. You do glance and see a small humanoid peeking through one of the ajar doors that you see, for a second you see a set of eyes, then it sees you and closes the door.
Laura: It saw you?
Sam: Oh, shit. Fuck, he knows I'm there, I got to keep going. I got to keep going, yeah.
Laura: You're invisible!
Sam: Yeah. (laughs) Yeah.
Matt: You keep moving towards the very, very center of town, moving past a couple of other patrols. You've passed, even in just this journey into the center of-- journey to the center of Westruun-- you've passed roughly 30 or so well-armed, relatively savage individuals that mark the same civilized level of Grog, give or take some further steps into society. Many of them are wearing pieces of clothing that have been taken from this town, they're dressed better than their station, you know, rough-looking, big, thick, unshaven faces for the humans, but they're still like dressed in pompous clothing that's partially torn and smeared. They're a walking parody of the people that once ruled this town, and they seem to know it. They're enjoying this gloating. Eventually you make your way to the central town square, which is not far from where the Margrave's home is. This area, you do notice, has been set up as a defensive central location. There are just barriers and barricades of all sorts of furniture that have been nailed together and this has been made an assault post, where if anyone were to attempt to attack the center of this town, this would be a wonderful defensive position for someone to hole up and wait it out, whether it be against other people or a dragon. It has been built with the best of their ability in that regard. And there are a number of weapons that they've taken from the city that have been bolted in, that have been strapped around, so there's just like jagged edges of halberds and whatever blades they could muster in every direction, therefore if anything wasn't being very careful and running through here, they could be easily shoved into one of these hazards or perhaps even pushed onto it as a means of display. Which you do notice, on a number of these, various heads are currently placed as warning symbols, in varying states of decay. You recognize two of the heads. One of which is--
Laura: No no no no no.
Matt: Sorry. One of them you recognize as the Margrave who once ruled Westruun, whose home Kevdak currently keeps as his own. And the other, let's see if I can recall what this one is. I have it written down here.
Taliesin: I like that this is that deep in your notes, is which heads are on spikes.
Matt: Hey, man, got to keep up with this.
Sam: Appendix A  Heads on Spikes, Various.
Matt: (laughs) Pretty much.
Sam: Subappendix  Westruun.
Matt: Ah, okay, here we go. Here we go. Okay. Loran the Bear. Loran the Bear was a mercenary that you guys faced off with the first time that you fought in the brawlers' league. You guys had a playful rivalry? You kept running into each other when looking for various--
Taliesin: It's like a best of season one, that's great.
Sam: The season that didn't air.
Taliesin: The season that didn't air.
Matt: But there you see him, or what remains of him, placed on one of these weapons. It looks like anybody who has attempted to rise up or at least make a stink about the current ruling class in Westruun have been put on display in this square in some way, shape, or form.
Sam: Are there any people? Guards? Goliaths?
Matt: You see a rather heavy group of well-armored goliaths and other savage-looking humanoid individuals. Mostly human, you see a couple half-orcs, but it's a total of ten of them that are all currently scattered throughout this central area, some of them just sitting down, snacking, a few that are just keeping watch, and a number that are hovering in and out of the door of the main area, giving orders and carrying some small supplies around.
Sam: Okay. So I'll just quickly-- are you guys ready?
Marisha: Do we want to get up on the wall? There's like a wall, right, around the city?
Sam: Yeah, but I'm in the center of the city.
Matt: Right. Also, there's no response.
Laura: Oh, he's out of range. Shit.
Sam: Do you know what the range is on that?
Matt: The range on those earpieces are roughly two miles.
Sam: Two miles.
Laura: He's out of two miles' range?
Matt: Well yeah, Westruun's a pretty big town, and it's--
Laura: It's a 15-minute walk, though.
Sam: Yeah, I walk fast.
Laura: You're a fast walker for a gnome.
Marisha: He really is a really fast walker.
Taliesin: Okay, go ahead.
Marisha: I cast Polymorph on Percy and turn him into a crow.
Taliesin: (eerily good crow noise)
Laura: Oh, again with the crows.
Marisha: Also, I use my beast shape to go into a crow. (crow noise)
Taliesin: (eerily good crow noise)
Marisha: (crow noise)
Taliesin: That's good enough, that's good.
Marisha: And we fly to the walls and perch on opposite sides on the entrance.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Look, your god is here to help us.
Marisha: (crow noises)
Laura: She sounds like shit.
Marisha: (a panoply of crow noises)
Taliesin: (a panoply of crow noises)
Matt: Stop it.
Taliesin: Sorry. (laughter)
Taliesin: It's really pleasing.
Matt: All right. You guys are perched on the edges of that. Scanlan, what're you doing?
Sam: So much. So much.
Laura: I feel like this is the first time I've seen you at a loss.
Travis: Look at those eyes.
Laura: Oh god.
Taliesin: Don't you want her to read the note?
Sam: Yeah, I go over to where the most people are congregated.
Matt: That's going to be right at the steps of the Margrave's manor.
Sam: I position myself about seven feet away from them.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And I cast Thunderwave.
Matt: And with that, (explosion), this burst of thunder comes blasting out centrally from where you are located, Scanlan. The DC on this, with your--
Sam: Thunderwave. Oh, is it spell?
Matt: It's spell, what's your DC?
Sam: 20.
Matt: 20.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Matt: Okay. Six fail, one succeeds on this save. So you hit them and they're all forced backwards, some of them up onto the stairs, some against the wall. Roll 2d8 points of damage.
Liam: Ragdoll physics.
Sam: 2d8?
Matt: Mm-hmm.
Sam: No, it's-- oh, that's, you're right.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: 11 plus something? No, I guess it's just 11.
Matt: It's just 11. All right, and one of them takes five points of damage and (impact sound) looks down at this little gnome that's there.
Sam: No, no, I'm still invisible. It's not a concentration spell.
Matt: Invisibility, I'm pretty sure that as soon as you do--
Sam: Oh, fuck.
Matt: The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.
Sam: Casts a spell?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Even though it's a concentration spell?
Matt: Yeah, you can cast other instantaneous spells, but as soon as you cast a spell you become visible.
Sam: What?
Matt: High-level invisibility, improved invisibility is the one that remains.
Sam: Oh well, I'm fucked, then. (laughter)
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: I'll say, do you have Greater Invisibility?
Sam: No. I can cast it at a greater level, but no, I don't have Greater Invisibility.
Matt: Yeah, at that moment you suddenly become visible.
Taliesin: Roll with it, roll with it.
Sam: Hi guys. Hi.
Marisha: But you're Scanlan, you can do this.
Matt: The surprise round, they weren't expecting it. Roll initiative right now.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Laura: Oh my god, Scanlan, run.
Sam: 16.
Matt: Rolled a one. I'm rolling them group initiative on this one, because I don't want to roll six different initiatives in this order. They all look at you dumbfounded. "We got an intruder!" Pull out their weapons, get ready. Two of them (growl) at you really angrily. What are you doing?
Sam: Fuck!
Matt: What are you doing, Sam?
Sam: This is not the plan!
Taliesin: No! No!
Travis: Don't say a thing, don't say shit.
Laura: Okay, yeah yeah, it's all you.
Sam: (mock-crying) At least I know that Pike didn't read the letter, though, so I'm okay. (laughter)
Taliesin: At the end of this fight, can I have your tie? I mean, you're not going to need it anymore.
Travis: Come on, what are you doing?
Sam: Okay. I'll Dimension Door into the house where the guy's eyeballs were.
Travis: Yes! I like it.
Matt: Wait, on the, to the house--
Sam: The house where I saw the guy who was peeking and saw me, he saw me, I'm going in there.
Matt: Oh!
Laura: What?
Liam: Smart.
Matt: How far is the range on Dimension Door?
Sam: 500 feet. Was that long ago or recently?
Matt: Wait, so. You were peeking, are you referring to the--
Sam: The guy who saw me as invisible.
Matt: Right. Okay, got you. All right, so you're going to that temple. That's probably about 1000 feet from you, you can Dimension Door closer to it.
Sam: Yes, I could. I could. Okay, okay. This is exciting, this is so exciting, nothing's working. Okay, yes, I will go toward it 500 feet.
Matt: Okay. You appear to the back end and around the road, just around the corner from where the entrance to that area is, so you're a little ways away. As you appear, catching your breath, you look over your shoulder and you hear in the distance more, a couple yells, and a bell starts going off (ringing) in the center of the town square.
Sam: It's going great, guys.
Laura: Do we hear the bell?
Matt: You guys can hear in the very distance a series of bells beginning to go (ringing).
Taliesin: Oh, sweet Jesus.
Matt: What're you doing now?
Sam: Well, they haven't caught up to me, right?
Matt: No no, you just moved 500 feet in one second, they have no idea where you went. You just showed up, went "Bye!" and vanished out.
Liam: Bell is bad. He's in trouble, we need to go in now.
Sam: I'm going to go again, Dimension Door into the temple.
Matt: Okay, you do see the temple. You're on the interior of it now, and looking inside you know a portion of it is collapsed, there's an open view on the second level where a whole corner of the secondary floor and first floor have fallen in, big pile of rubble, you can see the sky. There as you appear, you look around, you hear a series of gasps as you can now see huddled inside of this temple roughly 30 or so people, varying ages, varying racial backgrounds. These are some of the survivors in Westruun that are keeping in here, whether it be hidden, or at least this is where they live now. They look in various states of personal brutality that's been put against them, some of them are wounded, a few of them draw weapons immediately, and turning around, you see hunkered down inside a half-orc that rushes around, his hat half-kilter, his coat up with his shoulder, mantle part of his collar pressed upward, spins around, puts his blade out. "You've got to be kidding me. Scanlan Shorthalt."
Sam: That's me.
Matt: As Dr. Dranzel stands there before you. (cheering)
Matt: They themselves look a little worse for wear, and he looks over his shoulder and says, "Well shit, Kaylie, weren't you just talking about him yesterday?" As your daughter stands behind him, holding two of the children, trying to protect them as you appeared. She looks up at you and goes, "Oh, you've got to be kidding me." And that's where we'll end tonight's game. (yelling)
Travis: Perfect! Perfect, perfect.
Taliesin: Put that on like a Japanese businessman.
Liam: By the way, this one, under her breath, goes, "Oh I don't like him, he stole from me."
Sam: That's all you can think about?
Laura: Why am I cheering? He stole from us.
Sam: They're going to fucking save my life.
Liam: Well, maybe he needed it to save the world.
Matt: It's all survival. All right, then we'll pick it up from there next week.
Travis: Jesus. That was a hell of a 50th. Fuck's sake!
Taliesin: Why did we even bother to plan?
Taliesin: Why do we even bother to plan?
Marisha: Why do we even bother to plan?
Travis: It's going perfect! It's going perfectly. We are still on the rails. It is working.
Taliesin: We are still on the rails, it'll be great.
Marisha: I spent a 6th-level spell building that trench, it had better come in handy.
Ashley: It will, it will.
Taliesin: We're all going to fall and die in it, it's going to be great.
Liam: Scanlan is drunken master.
Matt: All righty, guys, we're going to go ahead and take a few minutes here to hunker down and prepare for the savage unwrapping of many presents that you, the community of Critical Role, have put in our direction. All of us so eternally undeserving, but so incredibly appreciative of all that you guys do, both to help with the charities that we support and spend your time being so awesome and creative and we're going to go ahead and--
Sam: Matt, though, but what are we going to do with the minutes while we're not on camera right now? How do we fill the airtime?
Matt: We'll, I'm sure, have a few videos to show that may also include our new intro.
Taliesin: Again! Again!
Marisha: Again! Again!
Laura: Again! Again!
Marisha: We're mainly doing this for our own selfishness. [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Taliesin: Pissblossom.
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where Taliesin jumps the gun and says his phrase too late.
Travis: Way too late, man! Way too late!
Matt: Welcome. Happy to be back. Very emotional episode last week. We're going to kick it into the next step of Vox Machina's adventure this week, and then, me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be gone next week, so there will not be progression in this current storyline. However, Liam O'Brien over there has been cracking up an awesome one-shot adventure for our remaining players and a few guests. Liam, if you want to talk a little about it?
Liam: Yeah, I'll tell you who's coming on by. Sure, I'll say who's coming on by. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Ashly Burch. And I don't want to spoil it, but Matt knows. It's different.
Matt: Yeah, it's going to be fun. This is Liam's brainchild, and I'm excited to see them play through it.
Liam: It could blow up in my face.
Matt: I think you'll be fine. If the last game was any indication, I think you'll be fine. All right, other announcements: once again, we have our wonderful sponsor with a new theme kicking in. Sam, you want to take this away?
Sam: Yes, I do, Matt Mercer. Guys  Loot Crate. Loot Crate has been such a great sponsor all year long, and we got another great week to share with you. Speed is this month's theme of the Loot Crate. I'm going to read this script first. Lace up your sneakers or rev your engines. September's all about speed. Feel the adrenaline with some of pop culture's quickest vehicles and characters. High-octane assortment of goodies from Batman, the Flash, the Arrow, the Battlestar Galactica, the Iron Man, the Gone in the Sixty the Seconds. (laughter)
Sam: It includes two collectibles, a figure, and as always, a monthly t-shirt. I'm wearing a t-shirt. Not from this month, but from last month.
Laura: It's got Futurama stuff on it.
Sam: Guys, I'm an actor. Why would you listen to me about this stuff? I'm a liar and a deceiver. But what you can listen to, and what you know in your heart, is hardcore facts. I'm talking statistics. I'm talking math. I've broken this down for you guys. If you use the promo-code CriticalRole, you'll get $3 off your first month. Doesn't sound like a lot, you think? Oh, that's 1.2 gallons of gas at the Quik Mart down the street. Regular, unleaded. Or let's say you're generous. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your family. That's four Loot Crates; that's $12. That is 25 and half Forever stamps that you've just gotten for free. For free! Let's say you're more generous than that. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your whole company. All 266 employees. You've just saved enough money to buy a 2002 Kia Sedona with 181,000 miles on it. The transmission is going out, and it doesn't shift in the higher gears, but it is for $800 on Craigslist. Go look for it right now, and it will be yours for free, essentially, if you buy 266 subscriptions to Loot Crate. 266.67. Okay, that is hardcore facts. You can't argue with that. Go out. Subscribe now. Save money. Get stamps and gas.
Liam: If you don't slow your roll, Loot Crate is going to poach you.
Matt: All right, thank you, Sam.
Sam: Don't forget to use the promo code CriticalRole.
Matt: Perfect. (laughs) All right, other announcements that we have. Let's see. Projects that have come up. They recently announced and put up the English cast video for Final Fantasy XV. I have the pleasure of playing Cor Leonis. It's a lot of fun. As a longtime Final Fantasy fan, being a part of this means a great deal, and I'm excited for the game that comes out in November. So if you haven't checked out the video, do so and you can watch me wax poetic briefly about my love of the series. Look forward to that.
Marisha: Soundbiting it up in that.
Matt: Yeah, man! They chose my soundbite for the end of it. I was like (explosion). Felt cool about that.
Marisha: It's like you're an actor.
Matt: It's like I played a bunch of them. Also, Deus Ex came out. Mankind Divided. I am scattered throughout the game with a very harsh Russian, Eastern European dialect, as many characters, probably yelling at you or being shot in the face. So enjoy that, as well.
Travis: I love shooting you in the face.
Matt: Hey, you know? Everyone's got a skillset. Anybody else have anything they want to announce?
Sam: We're nominated for an award, Matt.
Matt: That's right! We just got nominated for a Streamy. A Streamy award under gaming. Games. It's awesome!
Sam: It's our first nomination.
Taliesin: It's like the Kids' Choice Awards for adults.
Laura: But it's not. Fans don't get to vote.
Matt: It is now decided by whatever the Illuminati Streamy committee is.
Sam: Wait, fans don't get to vote? I'm sure they can influence things.
Marisha: Well, they nominated us, so we got this far because of them, and now we lose to Markiplier.
Matt: Love you, Mark. We're just excited to be in that ring. Thank you guys for being so awesome and supporting us, and hopefully some of us will get to dress up fancy and show up and go home proud that we went.
Taliesin: We'll plug our other friends who are also nominated.
Matt: And Muzzled the Musical, which I co-created, which Ashly Burch stars in, who you'll see next week, that got nominated for best indie.
Marisha: And Sean Becker. Who's my director for Signal Boost. All in the fam.
Matt: It's good. Awesome. Anything else you guys want to talk about?
Travis: Yes! In the world of sportsball, the 2016 future Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys are playing the Seattle Seahawks right now! So if you see me looking down, it's not because I'm not paying attention. I'm watching football.
Taliesin: I have never cared so much about football in my entire life as I do right now. Which is saying, I don't necessarily care a lot. But definitely--
Laura: More than it was.
Travis: Everybody send Sam a tweet. He's going to be crying at the outset of his team. Sam, a moment of silence.
Taliesin: I think he's lighting the set on fire.
Laura: Sam walked away so he wouldn't be on the same set as you were saying that.
Matt: Anyone else have anything they want to talk about before we jump into the game?
Taliesin: No announcements until I get back, I think.
Matt: All righty. That being the case, then let's go ahead and hop into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back. So to get you guys caught up: our band of adventurers, Vox Machina, in raising an army, hopefully, of allies and powerful artifacts to face the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of powerful, dangerous chromatic dragons that have been tearing through the countryside of Tal'Dorei and distant Wildemount. They have recently found some information, had a close call with the Frigid Doom known as Vorugal. The white dragon flyover did not pierce through the illusionary barrier that was placed with the help of Allura, Gilmore, and Pike, there in Whitestone. You then decided to go ahead and using that cue, before the dragon returned to its current roost that it has created over the ruins of the city of Draconia, you traveled across to the continent of Wildemount. You had a meeting with the Ravenites, a rather subverted, long-enslaved offshoot species of dragonborn kin, tailless and now surviving amongst a recent winter that seems to have come with the ruin the dragon brought. You also discovered that most of Draconia and its royal elite have been slaughtered as a means of the dragon establishing its dominance and the worship of the Ravenites that survived the fall of Draconia. You made a deal with Tooma, the current clan leader of the remaining Ravenites, that you would aid in destroying this dragon, basically the master that they replaced the Draconians with when it came. However, to ensure your help there was a two-week time limit, and if you do not return before then they would see you as not keeping your end of the deal, and they would then, instead, direct the dragon towards what was going to be Whitestone until you altered her memory, which she recalls now as Emon. Anyway, before you could be finding your way home, one of the corpses upon one of the ice spire spikes outside of the dragon's new nest, Percy saw to be the remains of your long-traveled friend, Tiberius Stormwind. The party had a fateful farewell; set him to rest within the ruins of the nearby library, fallen from the islands of Draconia; said your goodbyes; and then, upon prepping a bit, plotting, and planning, found your way back to Whitestone to continue the next leg of your adventure. And that is where we begin. You have now taken some time in your own respective rooms. It's still late afternoon, going into dusk. You all took some time to yourselves within Castle Whitestone to take a short rest and ruminate over these recent events and reveals. The evening sun draws close to dusk. It is your choice which you wish to do. If you wish to spend the evening resting here and then leaving first thing in the morning, that is up to you.
Liam: Taking the initiative. This one came to my room, then inside. I think we've probably been quiet for a while, staring at the ceiling, and after a while finally say: We've really fucked things up, haven't we?
Marisha: In which particular way do you mean, aside from all of them?
Liam: I need to tell you. I know with all that's happened, between my new patron and my sister pretending to gag literally every time we attempt to share a word together, and mostly my own being fucked up in the head for weeks now, that I've pushed all of you away. You most of all. Because I've been afraid you would-- I'm sorry. And you didn't deserve any of that. Keyleth, I need you to know, through all of that, everything, nothing has changed about how I-- We've had so many near-misses. And now, finding Tiberius. Death is unavoidable. And it's all the more reason for life to be lived. And it doesn't matter to me what this is. What we call it. If you are willing to spend some time, any time, with me, then I will simply count myself lucky to have it. You're very dear to me.
Marisha: You're talking too much. It's not like I've made myself very accessible either. It's not on you. It might be a little on you, but it's on both of us. Anyway, my point is: for the longest time, I was terrified that I was going to lose you. First to death and then to the Raven Queen, which is still kind of like death, and then ultimately to yourself. And then I had an interesting talk with Pike recently, and she said something that really stood out to me, and that was that some people just have more of themselves to give. And I realized this whole time that I was afraid of losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet been written, which is stupid.
Liam: Maybe so.
Marisha: But you're ultimately right. We have nothing to lose. I love you, Vax. And I'm sorry for being me, that it took me this long to say it.
Liam: (sniffles) I'm sorry.
Marisha: Yeah. Me, too.
Liam: I love you. That's pretty fucking great.
Marisha: That is pretty great, yeah. High five. Yeah!
Liam: I tackle her into a bit of a hug into the bed.
Laura: Oh!
Liam: We're already on the bed.
Marisha: And that's it for now.
Sam: Pan to the fireplace.
Travis: (laughing) Pan to the fireplace!
Matt: All right, so. Vox Machina. Taking your time to mourn in your own interesting ways. What is your path of action? What is your course, going forward?
Liam: Sleeping in.
Marisha: Bacon.
Laura: Yeah, I think we need to spend at least the night in Whitestone and get up in the morning.
Matt: Okay. So you've all spent the majority of it in your respective rooms-- most of you in your respective rooms-- figuring out where you are as a person and where this story leads you. After an evening's rest, the next morning comes around, breakfast is already prepared by the servants in the castle, though maybe not the amount of bacon you were hoping, and easily rectified upon request. It's at your disposal. There is a tension in the city; the barrier remains up. As you're having breakfast, you can see Zahra wander in at the smell of bacon, glances over the rest of you, still holding a book at her side that she slams closed. "Oh. I'm glad to see you're all right, and you're safe. Please tell me there's more bacon."
Travis: Not for long.
Laura: There's more coming, dear.
Travis: What she said.
Matt: She comes and sits down and spends breakfast with you guys, catching up on what has transpired and what your current plan of action is.
Taliesin: Zahra, it occurs to me, you come from a family with power, connections.
Matt: "Kind of. Let's just say we're estranged at the moment."
Taliesin: Well, we're looking for any ally we could, and we were curious if--
Matt: "You will find no allies where you're asking. Believe me, I'd be happy to offer if we could, but no."
Taliesin: I had a feeling. It just felt worth asking.
Matt: "It's all right. I'm going to continue with my research, since the rest of the ziggurat clan are now scattered about or maintaining that barrier. Guess who has to do the research in the meantime?" And she rolls her sleeves up; you can see the slightly smudged dirt across her reddish skin. She's been hard at work digging around trying to figure out what the basis of this enchantment beneath the city still is.
Laura: Sorry you can't be out having your fun, dear.
Matt: "I'm certain time will allow me at some point. It better. I'm going a little stir-crazy." She grabs the bacon from the table and walks out of the room.
Taliesin: Is Kashaw around by any chance, as well?
Matt: "I'm sorry, what?"
Taliesin: Kashaw. Is Kashaw around?
Matt: "I haven't seen him for a couple days. I've been underground most of the time."
Taliesin: Yes, of course. We have to send a letter to the Slayer's Take at some point. That should happen sooner rather than later.
Marisha: Trying to wrangle a beast?
Taliesin: Trying to wrangle a beast or seeing if they know of anything that's in the vicinity that we can at least feed to it in the meantime.
Laura: Maybe we can stop through on our way back. We are going to Marquet, aren't we?
Taliesin: I would hope so.
Marisha: And what's our intent in Marquet? To get the next Vestige?
Taliesin: To get to the next Vestige and to perhaps make some friends. The more the merrier.
Liam: And the means of travel is?
Taliesin: We have a sigil. We can teleport.
Laura: Gilmore. Gilmore's from Marquet.
Taliesin: This is a teleport sigil. This is not going to require his attention.
Marisha: Yeah, it's located in Whitestone Castle, correct? The teleport sigil?
Matt: It's actually a sigil by memory that he has, and it's a spell that he casts. It's not a permanent fixture in the city.
Taliesin: So we need him, but he can do it.
Sam: Yeah, but he's concentrating on the defensive wall right now.
Laura: It's up. As long as the dragon's not here and attacking.
Matt: It's a renewal feature. He has to spend some time each day maintaining it. He's not stuck there the whole time.
Sam: That would be awesome.
Taliesin: The worst job in Whitestone.
Sam: Before we go to Marquet. Let's say Marquet takes 13 days.
Taliesin: That's an awful long time.
Sam: I agree, but let's say it does. Do we know what we're doing with regards to Draconia when we come back? Do we have some sort of a plan? We're getting a beast. That's all we know.
Travis: Yep, we've got it covered. It's planned out to a T.
Laura: How are we even going to get a beast?
Taliesin: Talk to the Slayer's Take and see what is already on the continent.
Sam: What constitutes a beast? Because me and Keyleth can make some beasts.
Laura: I think a large enough beast to attract Vorugal.
Sam: Like a triceratops?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: They said it hunted something really intense recently.
Laura: He said they hunted remorhaz?
Marisha: Yeah, they went to the ocean.
Sam: What is that?
Matt: Roll an intelligence check.
Marisha: But I wrote it down.
Sam: For me. Ooh, a 19! Plus two.
Matt: That's what they look like.
Laura: Oh. Those are big and scary.
Sam: Is it a gargantuan monster?
Matt: They're huge. Most definitely. They're nasty; they burrow. The actual blood within their body is heated to such a degree that even to be in a scuffle with it is to scar yourself with flame and heat.
Sam: And it was bored with that?
Taliesin: We want to find a creature that would threaten a medium-sized city.
Marisha: So it wants competition.
Taliesin: We want to wear it down a bit before we go in for the attack. We want it to be breathing heavily.
Sam: And how are we going to get this creature there?
Taliesin: We're going to find something that's already on the continent.
Laura: And Vorugal will go to the creature.
Taliesin: He will be happy to attack it.
Travis: Can you put it in your necklace?
Sam: On the continent. What continent? The Draconian continent?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: So we have to go back there to search!
Marisha: The Slayer's Take should know. They've got contracts everywhere.
Sam: All right. This is slightly a better plan than I thought.
Marisha: We thought about it a little.
Taliesin: Six people cannot wage a war.
Sam: Then we should go talk to the Slayer's Take now so they can get started on this hunt.
Taliesin: We're going to send them a letter.
Sam: A letter?!
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Who's the letter carrier and how's he going to get out of this city that's protected by an invisible wall?
Taliesin: We're going to make Kashaw take the letter.
Liam: When we were last there, hadn't they talked about a brass or bronze dragon? But there are brass dragons, as you well know.
Laura: I know, because I'm an expert.
Liam: Is that overkill? We'd have to convince a dragon, not capture a dragon.
Taliesin: It would probably kill the dragon.
Marisha: Wait, are we talking about capturing another dragon to fight another dragon?
Sam: No, we're talking about convincing a dragon to go fight this dragon that would clearly kill it.
Taliesin: I was going to find Kashaw and see if he would run the letter to the Slayer's Take and be our emissary and convince them to do this so that we're not doing everything ourselves.
Sam: Wait, is there anyone else who can make this message delivery faster or safer?
Taliesin: Literally everyone. If we could find a child in a pub who could take it.
Sam: No, but faster and safer.
Taliesin: Kashaw is possibly slower than a child.
Marisha: No more small boys, Percy. No more.
Laura: We could ask Zahra, but she's busy with research.
Travis: I think Kashaw is a great people-person.
Taliesin: Just to get rid of him, they would say yes.
Sam: All right.
Liam: He wants to help. He does.
Laura: Yeah. Let's go find Kashaw.
Matt: You guys head outside of Castle Whitestone. Not far from the base of the pathway into the actual city, you can see there is a series of newer-outfitted guards. They are people being trained in the force of combat. You can see that there's definitely a ramping-up of the defense force for Whitestone as a precaution.
Marisha: Do they look like townspeople?
Matt: Many of them look able-bodied and people that are strong and fit, but they do appear to be civilians that have had to take up the cause just in case.
Marisha: Any kids?
Matt: No kids, no. They all look to be at least of strapping age, to be carrying a weapon.
Sam: Strapping boys?
Taliesin: Strapping. The strapping age.
Laura: Did we ever talk to Cassandra or anyone else about starting an alarm system here?
Sam: Yeah, and they were working on it already, weren't they?
Taliesin: No, they started. They are working on it now.
Sam: I think it's done.
Taliesin: I'd buy that. Yes, it was proposed.
Marisha: I do want to maybe talk to Gilmore, though.
Taliesin: Well, we're going to have to if we leave the city, anyway.
Matt: As you are watching the group go through their different weapon practice moments, they're breaking off into small sparring groups and they're going up against ramshackle built training dummies. There are a few that are doing forms in succession. (grunts) You know the deal. You do see on the opposite end that the person who is currently helming one section of the training is Kashaw. You can see a bunch of shield and spear fighters right now, and he's basically giving them instruction on how to use a shield defensively and the spear offensively simultaneously.
Laura: Maybe he's not the best messenger if he's training our armies.
Taliesin: This is not an army. This is something for the population to do while they pass time. The dragon shows up, they're all going to die, no matter how many times they learn how to put the spear forward.
Marisha: As cynical as Percy is being right now, he's right.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: But it doesn't mean that Kashaw is going to think that it's any less important, and I'm sure he might not take it as a compliment if we ask him to be the messenger boy.
Sam: It's an incredibly important mission!
Laura: It's not just a messenger, it's defeating a dragon.
Taliesin: And it's convincing the Slayer's Take to join.
Sam: The Slayer's Take, if I recall, doesn't do things for free. We're going to have to pay for this, even though we're members.
Taliesin: We're going to have to bring them some dragon parts.
Laura: No, we take a contract on a really large creature, and then we let the dragon do the work for us. We get the best of both worlds.
Taliesin: Ooh, that's very clever.
Sam: We take a contract on an existing creature that we have to somehow find in Draconia.
Travis: No, we bring the dragon to the creature.
Sam: How?
Laura: He hunts them. That's what he does.
Sam: Not transcontinentally.
Travis: You can't broker a fight between a huge beast and a white dragon?
Taliesin: We could sell tickets.
Travis: I think you've done better.
Liam: We don't necessarily have to sacrifice a dragon. We're fighting a war here. They're fuckers.
Sam: No, we're not talking about sacrificing a dragon. We're talking about finding a beast.
Liam: Well, I'm talking about a dragon. Couldn't we try to talk a dragon into helping us do what we're doing? They're not all evil, are they? They're not!
Marisha: Yeah, but do we know of any other dragons here?
Laura: Well, then we're going to have to fucking go to the Slayer's Take.
Travis: Can we go somewhere in the next 60 seconds?
Laura: This'll be great.
Marisha: Let's talk to Kashaw. We go up and we talk to Kashaw.
Matt: As you approach, you see him leaning in with younger, early twenties-looking men. A bit scrawny; they're still armored; the helmet looks a little lopsided. Kashaw's like, "You're not supposed to put the shield away. (sighs) Oh, wonderful. Take five. Take 30. So. You're alive. That's great. I'm excited. What can I do for you?"
Taliesin: Kashaw, how would you like to be anywhere else other than here right now?
Matt: "Depends on where and what you'd have me doing."
Taliesin: That's exactly the sort of enthusiasm I was hoping for. We have need of an emissary to the Slayer's Take. We need to convince them to help us kill the next dragon.
Laura: And Vanessa really likes you.
Taliesin: She does.
Marisha: We need a big beast on Draconia.
Matt: "So you're saying that I go back to frozen-ass Vasselheim to deliver a paper message to the headmistress, whom already I am so happy to be away from."
Marisha: Yeah. See?
Matt: He glances over at the rest of the soldiers. "Yeah, I'll take it." (laughter)
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: We are in your debt. I'll have the paper drawn up, and anything you can do to put the weight of the situation behind us and make sure they know how clear it is and how necessary this is and how desperate we are.
Matt: "I'll do my best to muster some semblance of emphasis."
Taliesin: And we'll figure out ways to make sure there's money in it for them, or at least dragon parts.
Matt: "All right. Give me a list of what you've got to offer. I'll bring it to them."
Taliesin: Excellent.
Sam: What do we got to offer?
Liam: We don't have the troll dick anymore. That's gone.
Laura: We have 40 pounds of dragonhide. Black dragonhide.
Taliesin: And white dragonhide.
Laura: We don't have white dragonhide.
Taliesin: We have white scales.
Travis: We have 64 pounds of scales from me. We have four claws left.
Sam: I have a Tome of Leadership worth 30,000 gold.
Laura: No, that's Keyleth's, remember? In the next century, when she's still living.
Sam: We'll get it back before 100 years are up.
Marisha: I'll lend it to them for 100 years.
Sam: A 99-year lease.
Travis: And we got umber hulk pieces, too.
Taliesin: Mostly, I was thinking of also offering them whatever we can take from the dragon itself once it's destroyed.
Liam: I was about to say, yeah, we put into the contract that it has the remains of the beast we take down, which we will take down.
Taliesin: We keep some scales, we keep some teeth; we split it.
Liam: Sure, as a souvenir, right. Yes.
Marisha: We're basically doing a contract for free.
Liam: It's a very large creature.
Sam: That's provided we kill it. If we lose, they get nothing. I'm just saying, from their perspective, we're offering them literally nothing.
Marisha: If they lose, they don't lose anything either, right?
Laura: No, they do. They lose a contract.
Marisha: But wouldn't the contract just go right back into cycle?
Laura: No, if the dragon kills the creature and then we all die and we can't harvest it, the Slayer's Take doesn't have anything from its previous contract.
Liam: But that could happen with any contract. Any band of idiots could go die on the battlefield.
Marisha: They're used to having people die.
Laura: Well, fuck it.
Marisha: I think Grog's getting antsy.
Taliesin: I like this. I'm going to have it drawn up.
Liam: I look at Grog and see he's really bored. I pick up a wooden sword and I hit him as hard as I can on the small of his back.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Make a check.
Liam: It's not going to be that hard.
Laura: While all this is going on, Grog, you could be training these soldiers.
Liam: 17.
Travis: What, train them?
Matt: As you're having this conversation, (whack) right in the knee cap, a surprisingly painful and forceful blow. It's less the strength behind it and more the precision in which it strikes you right between the kneecap and the rest of the lower half of your knee.
Travis: Like when a doctor hits you and your knee jumps?
Matt: Yeah, and you're like (grunts) and you glance over and you see Vax hide a wooden sword quickly behind him as he backs away.
Liam: Come on, big guy! I know you're bored! Come on! I hit him again.
Matt: Roll a strength check. Actually, this time it's an attack roll, as well.
Marisha: Hit him in the nuts.
Liam: Okay, cool. That's a 20. Oh! But it's with a stick! Just strength modifier?
Matt: You're not proficient with a sword.
Liam: Oh dear. I'm going to use Luck. 14.
Matt: (laughs) You whack him. This time, it hits the meat of his thigh and has no effect.
Liam: I missed the nut? Ugh. Come on!
Travis: Do you have a death wish?
Liam: Come on, take a swing! I'm trying to do you a favor! Come on, get it out!
Travis: What am I missing here?
Taliesin: I'm seeing this going down. I've walked away.
Liam: I see a gauntlet on a table, and I throw it at his face.
Matt: Okay, roll an attack roll.
Liam: It's a one! (laughter)
Sam: I see this going on, and I stand up on something, and I yell to the students--
Matt: Before this happens, as you're getting up, you watch as Vax rears back, and as he throws it, (yelps) he pulls a muscle in his shoulder and it drops to the ground, and you're like (pained noises).
Laura: Seriously?
Sam: I jump up on a chair and I yell to the students: Instructor Kashaw has instructed us that this is a drill! You are to attack that man right there, that large man, as a test of your strength and training. Now!
Laura: Don't kill them, Grog!
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: Oh, this is going to be awful. Wow. That is cruel.
Sam: 34. (laughter)
Matt: You watch as roughly 45 armored soldiers all turn towards you with their shields and spears... and freeze. They all slowly look towards Scanlan and whisper among themselves, then look back at Grog and stay frozen and two creep forward for a minute. Get a little closer.
Travis: I take the Gauntlets and I smash them together, and I grow in size. (laughter)
Matt: As your form swells into your now enlarged goliath battle-ready form, you notice a few of them start giving off this rattling metal sound as their armored knees (clanging) together. Many of them step back about ten feet, and Kashaw, who hasn't left entirely, spins around and goes: "The gnome's fucking with you. It's fine!" He walks up to you, Scanlan, pats your arm and goes, "That was pretty funny."
Sam: I try.
Matt: "Don't get the people killed. I've been working on them for four days."
Sam: He wasn't going to kill-- Were you going to kill them, Grog?
Travis: Yes.
Sam: Oh shit.
Travis: I look at Vax and I go, you were just playing around, right?
Liam: Yes.
Travis: And in my giant state, I'm going to kick him like a soccer ball.
Liam: I'm going to dodge. Uncanny Dodge, man.
Matt: Well, we'll see. Go ahead and roll an attack roll.
Travis: That's good. 32.
Liam: Ooh. No, I didn't miss that.
Matt: Roll a strength check.
Liam: Wait, I'm going to use another Luck and make him roll again and pick the lower of the two.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 15 on the strength check. 25.
Liam: Got to roll again for the hit.
Matt: Roll again because he used a Luck point to force you to reroll your attack roll.
Travis: 24.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: What was the strength roll again?
Travis: The strength was 24.
Matt: Strength check was 24. So as you peek out of the corner of your eye you hear this (heavy steps) and as you try and spin and dodge out of the way instinctually--
Liam: Uncanny Dodge!
Matt: I know and we'll get to that. Instinctually, you turn to dodge out of something Grog-sized, not giant-sized. And in that brief minute that you remember that he grew, you pause just long enough to (whack) feel the force of what feels like a giant battering ram slam into your side, sending you off your feet and arcing a good 30 feet before you (impact) tumble and skid to the ground. What's your strength modifier?
Travis: Seven.
Matt: Seven. You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half because you're taking Uncanny Dodge. So only seven points bludgeoning damage. You stay there for a second, stunned. You feel a bit of bile and iron taste in the back of your throat.
Liam: And in the distance you hear  (strained) I feel so alive. (laughter)
Taliesin: First rule of Fight Club.
Travis: Can I check the Titanstone Knuckles? Have they changed now that I've kicked a friend in the face?
Matt: (laughing) Make an investigation check.
Travis: Damn it! Eight.
Matt: They appear to have maintained their composure as gauntlets.
Liam: There's some blood and five long, dark hairs on them.
Matt: You watch as a lot of the soldiers who had been watching this endeavor step even further away from Grog, and some of them begin walking off, taking their helmets off. "All right, we're done."
Laura: Hey bonus, he's on our side. Eh? That's encouraging.
Matt: They all nod their heads. "Yeah, I know that. Thank god!" But they're all doing this while still locking eyes with him. "That's great." And slowly walk off.
Travis: (chuckles)
Liam: Vex.
Laura: Yeah?
Liam: Help me up.
Laura: Don't you have wings?
Liam: Not going to use them right now. Just a hand. (groans) That's going to bruise. Worth it.
Travis: Thank you. I was getting so bored.
Liam: (sighs) I know.
Travis: Thanks, bubby.
Taliesin: What are the chances I would have at least a basic portable writing desk? They're not that complicated.
Matt: A portable writing desk?
Taliesin: 16th century-style. Just something to write on.
Marisha: What do you need a writing desk for?
Taliesin: Just something with paper, pen, and something to write on.
Matt: You have access to a quill and ink, you have access to parchment.
Liam: How about a fucking clipboard?
Taliesin: It's basically a fucking clipboard.
Matt: You have access to that, yes.
Liam: Percival de Rolo, Inventor of Clipboard.
Taliesin: No, it was called a writing desk back then. It was called a writing desk. There's a thing. It was that big and you put it on your lap. It was a writing desk.
Matt: All right. Yes, you have access to that.
Sam: So wait, what is in this letter? What are we offering them?
Marisha: Yeah, how's the letter going?
Taliesin: I'm writing the letter up. I've basically gotten it together. I've explained the situation briefly. I assume they're aware of the war and the current reality.
Sam: And to clarify for me. We're asking them--
Taliesin: I'm getting there. In this, I'm asking for their assistance in killing a dragon. For this assistance, they will get all bounty of biological remnants of the dragon, with a small percentage of scales and teeth kept for us. Asking for 20 percent, but negotiable. We want them to supply either a local or give some intel into where we can find a beast large enough for this dragon to attack. Information that we have on this dragon so that they actually help us strategize any ways of defeating it, and any other help that they could give in defeating this creature. And as a token of our goodwill, we are sending them a small package of black and white dragon scales and a dragon tooth.
Laura: Yes. And make sure to include that this must all be completed within 14 days.
Sam: But wait.
Travis: There's more.
Taliesin: There's more.
Sam: Asking them to help us kill a dragon?
Taliesin: For stuff.
Sam: No, but that's not what we're asking them. We're asking them to find a beast.
Laura: Yes, that's what he said.
Taliesin: It's in the letter.
Laura: That's part of that listening thing, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm sorry.
Liam: He did talk for quite a while.
Taliesin: Is there a way to enchant me so that I have his voice? And then he'll listen more closely?
Marisha: Yeah, actually.
Matt: He has a spell for that. (laughter)
Taliesin: Don't answer that.
Matt: As you finish penning the letter, you read over it once, twice, make sure all the information is contained. You go ahead and grab the little bit of your offering of dragon scales and teeth. Present them to Kashaw. He takes the letter and reads it over. "Sure."
Sam: Should we add an NDA?
Taliesin: There's a rider at the end of everything I send.
Laura: Kashaw. No mention of Whitestone at all. Anywhere you go. Very important.
Travis: Good addendum. Whatever that word is.
Liam: Again, please?
Laura: No mention of Whitestone.
Taliesin: No mention of Whitestone.
Laura: Do we have a way to get him there very quickly?
Marisha: What? Kashaw?
Matt: "Are you going to do your tree thing for me? Otherwise, I can walk, but it'll be a month and a half before I get to shore."
Marisha: Yeah. We're going to be here the rest of the day, right?
Sam: How will he get back?
Marisha: Druids. People. Wizards. Sorcerers.
Sam: Wait! We got those rocks.
Laura: He's a really smart man.
Taliesin: Oh, the rock. That's a really good idea.
Laura: Yeah, but then he'll pop where we are.
Taliesin: No, we'll leave the rock here.
Sam: We're going to stay here at least a day.
Liam: Well, you've got friends, don't you?
Matt: "I'm can figure something out."
Laura: Don't worry about it.
Sam: Steal an airship on your way back.
Matt: (chuckles) "No."
Marisha: All right. Let's go to the Sun Tree.
Matt: "All right." Gets his shield and his spear and walks down with Keyleth towards the Sun Tree. As he's walking down, at your side.
Laura: Don't you want to walk with them?
Liam: No. Where is that coming from?
Sam: No, he definitely has a thing for you, Vax. I have a keen eye for these things.
Liam: But you can't address it. You just have to let it be. I'm not going to encourage it. I'm not interested in him.
Taliesin: I see it every time. He does. He smolders.
Matt: As he walks with you down the pathway, having this conversation. It's that awkward, quiet about three, four minutes of walking before he goes. (sniffs) "Ugh. So when all this is over--"
Marisha: Oh, come on, man. Why are you doing this to me? (laughter)
Travis: Hold on, it's going to happen. Let it happen.
Matt: "If we survive all this dragon business--"
Marisha: Fuck you, I hate you so much right now. (laughs) Uh-huh?
Matt: "Do you want to get a drink?"
Marisha: I love drinks.
Matt: "Good."
Marisha: So much.
Matt: "Great."
Marisha: What kind of a drink?
Matt: You guys begin to approach the edge of the tree. He goes: "I think you answered your own question."
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Is that a yes?"
Marisha: Well...
Matt: "Open the damn tree."
Marisha: Look. You know. It's really complicated right now, and I'm trying this whole "allowing myself to feel things" thing.
Matt: "Yeah. It doesn't work out for anybody. Trust me."
Marisha: Oh man. I don't know how to respond to that. I'll see you on the other side. We'll put a pin on this one. Bye, Kash. And I cast it through the tree and I push him in.
Matt: "All right, then. We'll just-- hey!" And you push him through the tree. Shuts behind him. You're left there alone, standing in the cold Whitestone air outside of the Sun Tree. Around mid-morning.
Sam: Did Kash leave already?
Marisha: Yeah, he's gone.
Sam: Aw, Vax, you didn't get a chance to say anything to him. I've talked to him about this. He has his eyes out on you.
Liam: I've got enough complications around me as it is.
Sam: I'm a really good reader of people.
Liam: It's true.
Sam: The dark eyeliner--
Laura: So now that that's handled, are we leaving today?
Taliesin: Oh, we're leaving today.
Sam: Well, one of us doesn't have any luck left, so maybe we should spend the night.
Liam: I've got a little bit of luck. I'm a lucky guy.
Taliesin: We'll get our luck back tomorrow.
Laura: We've got a limited amount of time on this.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way towards the building that has recently been essentially given to and is acting as the abode for Shaun Gilmore while he's here in Whitestone. As you come to the front door, the door's closed. You knock. (knocking) No response.
Liam: Shaun? Shaun! It's us. Are you home?
Matt: You hear a muffled voice in the distance within the building go, "Yeah, hold on."
Laura: Did it sound like anyone we knew?
Matt: It sounded like Gilmore. He's under some sort of duress.
Marisha: Sounded like he was under duress?
Matt: Slightly.
Laura: Is everything okay?
Matt: "Yes. Hold on, please." And you watch as the barrier flickers for a second and restores itself, almost like a wave of energy brought what was a slowly dwindling bit of the blue energy, now restored to its full strength.
Travis: He's got to use the privy at some point.
Sam: Yeah, he's probably squeezing one out. It's okay.
Matt: A moment passes before the door opens again and you see Gilmore there, beads of sweat down the front of his face. He's got his fuzzy purple-blue robe wrapped around him. "My sincerest apologies, I had to take care of the now morning ritual."
Laura: How are you holding up, Gilmore?
Matt: "I'm fine. This is child's play compared to what you're having to deal with on a daily basis, I'm sure."
Marisha: Can I do an insight check?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: 15.
Laura: Oh! You got a whisper on a 15.
Sam: This is an early whisper. A first-hour whisper is rare.
Taliesin: It came at such a high speed. I wish it came so quickly.
Liam: I wish I knew more about Loot Crate right now.
Sam: Well, it's not just Loot Crate, Liam. It's Loot Wear. Those come in a separate bag.
Liam: Different than Loot Crate?
Sam: Yeah, it's different. You can find out all about it at lootcrate.com/criticalrole.
Laura: Actually, the shirt you're wearing, Sam, is from Loot Wear.
Sam: What? It is? Oh my god! And I'm so handsome.
Taliesin: Anyway, back to the game.
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Laura: Well, we plan to go to Marquet. Things have progressed much quicker than we expected it to, and unfortunately we are on a two-week time crunch before all hell breaks loose.
Matt: "Well, at the very least, that gives us a series of days to make the best of the time we have. So Marquet it is. All right. Come in." He closes his robe a little bit and walks in, and you enter. You can see there's a half-drunken tea set, and he begins to walk past. "Tea, anyone?"
Sam: I'd like a loose-leaf oolong, please.
Matt: "I'll do what I can."
Taliesin: How many cups are currently sitting with the teapot?
Matt: Currently, there is one cup, but as he walks by, he does this with his fingers and you watch as multiple cups drift off the shelf and find their way (cups landing) on the table.
Laura: How does his house look? Does it look together like it would normally be, or does it look disheveled at all?
Matt: It looks a little disheveled, but also it hasn't been too long since the assassination attempt on him and he threw his attacker into the far wall, but it looks like the furniture has been placed up. There are still some bits and pieces of broken things here and there, but for the most part it doesn't look like he's had lot of time to clean up other than just making it functional. It seems livable; it's not too bad. He goes into the kitchen. He comes back out a moment later with a fresh pot of hot tea and sets it down. "All right. So this isn't going to send you to where you're going--"
Sam: We literally know nothing about Marquet.
Matt: "It's hot. It's dry. Bring some water if you can."
Liam: You're not able to leave, are you?
Matt: "I should not. Got to keep this going until Allura comes back."
Sam: Is there anyone that we can say maybe vouches for us or someone who we are against so that we can win favor with the locals? Something like a no-tail, long-tail binary.
Liam: We walked into a sort of political snafu because we didn't know the lay of the land, so is there anything we should know in advance?
Matt: "Best I can tell you, because I haven't been there since I was very young, one: this going to send you not to Ank'Harel itself, it's going to send you to Shandal, which is a small oasis village a little ways south of Ank'Harel. It's where I grew up."
Liam: What was that name again?
Matt: "Shandal."
Liam: Shandal.
Matt: "I will say that it has been about 15 years, so I don't quite know what to expect there. I apologize in advance for any ensuing chaos, but it's a nice town. It's small, it's sleepy. It's not my speed. Hence why I came here. However, in Marquet, it's mostly music, culture, fun people, good food. Don't break the laws. Don't drink the water freely from the various channels you may stumble across. Water there is a commodity. It is controlled and sold throughout the city."
Liam: We got a jug.
Travis: We got loads.
Matt: "Those are the main things I can think of. I don't know what else you're really looking for there."
Sam: Well, I can tell you.
Taliesin: Cabal's Ruin.
Sam: Thank you.
Taliesin: The Den of Druja.
Marisha: The Den of Druja.
Marisha: Druyah. Drujah?
Taliesin: Druhah.
Marisha: Jaja.
Taliesin: Thanks.
Matt: "I don't know anything about that, unfortunately, but most folks that have information are eager to give what they know with a little coin to grease the palm."
Taliesin: Or a little water.
Matt: "Depends on who you're talking to. Anything else?"
Liam: No, go ahead.
Matt: He pours tea for everyone else who asked for it. And for each person that asked for a different flavor of tea, he begins to snap his fingers and the tea color changes.
Laura: We are looking for a merchant warrior. Outside of you, do you know of any very powerful merchants?
Matt: "There are many."
Laura: One with a missing eye?
Matt: "That would definitely probably narrow it down, but none that I can remember off the top of my head."
Sam: Why don't we bring Jarett with us? Is that a thing?
Laura: We should talk to him.
Sam: Okay. Shaun, you do so much for us. We do nothing for you. Is there anything we can bring back for you or messages to give to someone there?
Liam: Is there anyone you haven't seen in all these years?
Matt: "When you meet them, and you'll know who they are, tell them I say hello. And actually--" He thinks to himself for a second. Rushes off. Comes back with a small backpack made of leather and thick, light tan wool. He opens it up and reaches inside. Pulls out a small silver locket and takes it and puts it in your hand, Vex. He goes, "Just give that to them."
Laura: To them?
Matt: He closes the bag and places it back in the other room.
Marisha: Shaun, are you doing okay? You look a little worn out.
Matt: (sighs) "We do what we must."
Marisha: I could only imagine a barrier of this size of a construct can be quite taxing on one's physical energy.
Matt: "Yes. I guess if I had one request of all of you, this goes universally, can we end this dragon business soon? Please? I really just want to set up shop again."
Liam: We would like nothing more. I think we're on the same page.
Matt: "Great."
Laura: We're very interested to start paying you for your service again, Gilmore, and stop expecting it for free.
Matt: "Good. Because I've been keeping a tally. I don't know about you guys, but the tab is running very deep."
Laura: Oh, believe me. I have, as well. This locket will take a nice little chunk off of that tally.
Matt: "Fantastic. I love it."
Liam: Birds of a feather, you two.
Sam: Should we go talk to Jarett and then come back?
Taliesin: Let's go talk to Jarett. We'll have appropriate clothing set up and prepare ourselves for the trip.
Sam: Robes and things?
Matt: "I'll be here if you need me."
Laura: Thank you.
Sam: We'll be back in an hour.
Matt: "All right. You don't want the rest of your tea?"
Sam: Oh. I'll drink it.
Laura: Do you have any to-go cups? (laughs) Just kidding.
Matt: "These didn't belong to me, so please, take them if you want." (laughter)
Matt: He transitions the tea over into a couple of cups and hands them off to you guys who haven't finished. You head out. As you're leaving, you see Sherri coming up. Her hair's a bit tattered. She's usually more put together when she runs the shop. Now she's in casual Sherri mode. Her hair is frazzled and pulled back. Her glasses are pushed to the end of her nose, and she's carrying a bundle of groceries, various bits of produce and such. "Oh, hello, everyone. I'm bringing Gilmore his breakfast."
Liam: Sherri. We asked him, but he's modest. How's he doing?
Matt: "Not that he'd tell me anything, but he doesn't have a very lengthy period of keeping this up without him probably collapsing like he did back in the city. Just please, try to do your best to get this over with. I'm worried. At the very least, until Allura comes back. At least they can share the load. All right." She knocks on the door and opens it. "Gilmore? Gilmore, breakfast." The door closes behind her.
Travis: Hey, I have an idea.
Sam: Oh boy.
Travis: I know, it's thrilling. We need eight gallon wine skins or bottles or jugs. Because the Alchemy Jug can make out eight gallons of fresh water. We pour it all out and then at the end of the day it starts over, so we have eight gallons sitting in the bag.
Taliesin: In theory, we all have water skins, don't we?
Marisha: We should have a spread of our survival kits.
Liam: But all the same, that is a very good idea, Grog.
Laura: I'm surprised you even know how many eight gallons is, Grog.
Travis: Yeah, eight gallons.
Sam: But if we had an extra skin or something, we could trade it. We could give it away, so we should go get one, yeah?
Travis: Yeah, we could give it away, give it away, give it away now.
Laura: Wow. I walk off and look for Jarett.
Liam: A rift just opened in the universe.
Matt: It doesn't take you long. He is still stationed as one of the central figures guarding the actual castle of Whitestone itself. Similar to the place you saw him last time you guys had a conversation walking up to the castle. He stands there with his crossbow at the ready, giving a long view over the surrounding valley before he watches you approach. "Friends, you have returned. I hope all is well on your end. Can I be of service?"
Laura: You can tell us all about where you're from, actually. Did you leave Marquet a long time ago?
Matt: "It was maybe ten, nine years ago, and it was not under the best terms. Probably would be in jail had I not got away."
Laura: Oh, really?
Matt: "They are not very forgiving of broken laws there, and based on certain judgments... let's just say a slap on the wrist usually takes the wrist with it."
Laura: What did you do?
Matt: (sighs) "Whatever was needed for survival."
Liam: Well, we're going there, so I'm hoping either you can give us a lot of tips so we don't run into problems, or I don't know if anyone can take your place right now. Do you want to go on a field trip?
Matt: "To Ank'Harel?"
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: "No!" (laughter)
Matt: "I'm sorry, I respect this. I think my strength and skill set is much better used here than in the Scarlet Prison beneath the Cerulean Palace. I do not want to even conjecture spending the rest of my life there, or in pieces. Also possible."
Liam: Forget it. We need all the knowledge in your head, in ours.
Marisha: Yeah, what was that Scarlet Prison you just mentioned, under the what now?
Matt: "The Cerulean Palace. The Cerulean Palace is where the Hand of Ord generally keeps most justice, where most of the courts are kept. It is also where the Tower of J'mon Sa Ord is maintained for watching over the entire city, and most of that eastern side of Marquet. The Scarlet Prison is where people go to disappear. It is also referred to as the Scarlet Oubliette. People are placed there to go away; people are placed there to be tortured; people are placed there, rumors say, to be part of various experiments. Regardless, I would highly recommend--" He looks to you. "Don't steal anything unless you are damn sure nobody knows of it."
Liam: I haven't stolen anything in years.
Travis: (coughing) Bullshit.
Laura: Me neither. (laughs nervously)
Marisha: I've never stolen anything!
Laura: Have you heard about the Den of Drujah. Drujah.
Matt: He closes his eyes a second. "That was... a very, very--"
Laura: It's unscrupulous.
Taliesin: It would have been in a tale of a one-eyed merchant.
Matt: "Not any merchant I know, but this Den you speak of, they were a rather serious gang running rather violent activities in the city maybe 70, 80 years ago."
Taliesin: Would they have been in the walls? Is it possible to be in the walls of Ank'Harel?
Matt: "In the outer walls? The outer walls are solid. They are thick; they are meant for defense only. I did not run with them. I do not know anything. It was before my time, but they have not been around for at the very least 50 years."
Laura: All right.
Sam: Do you know who rules Ank'Harel now?
Matt: "It is J'mon Sa Ord."
Liam: What can you tell us about him? Or her, or it?
Matt: "J'mon? I have not seen J'mon, though I have heard the stories. J'mon brought the city together 400 years before. When it began to grow, expand, when it became this great oasis, long ago, it went into chaos, and there were many who wished to utilize those who lived within the center desert to be abused, to be swindled, to be enslaved. J'mon started the Hand of Ord, which was the peacekeepers, and really brought the town of Ank'Harel into the grand city it is today. Not known to appear in public very often; there are many rumors that circulate. Some say that perhaps J'mon is some godling, an entity that has existed long before Ank'Harel and will exist long after. There is also-- and this is my personal belief-- I think J'mon Sa Ord is many people. I think J'mon is more of an office, a station, a title that's passed on from person to person, because I've heard referenced as a girl, I've heard referenced as a boy."
Laura: It's like the Man in Black.
Liam: What story is that?
Laura: It's this famous tale of the Princess Bride. Don't worry about it.
Sam: Does the Hand of Ord carry any symbol? Do you know of any way of identifying them?
Matt: "They carry ornate armor of a deep blue sapphire color, and brass."
Liam: Brass.
Laura: Like the dragon.
Sam: And this other city, Shumble. Humbal.
Laura: Shandal.
Marisha: Shandal.
Matt: "Shandal! Yes. (laughs) It's more of a podunk."
Laura: A very small town.
Matt: "Comparatively, yes. Ank'Harel is immense. Shandal is usually a small stop in case camels or other horses have died in transit, as well as a small water stop on the way to the city."
Laura: Is it a long trek from there to the city?
Matt: "I'd say maybe a day's travel."
Sam: In which direction?
Matt: "It is to the south-southwest of Ank'Harel."
Liam: On par with Emon, the city? Bigger? Smaller?
Matt: "Oh, Emon? Comparable. A bit bigger."
Laura: Wow. Shit.
Taliesin: We'll make waves.
Marisha: Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't.
Taliesin: Well. We're going to have to get someone's attention.
Marisha: It's a city that has no water. We shouldn't make waves.
Laura: Do you remember, in all your time there, did you ever deal with-- this is completely ridiculous-- a merchant who only had one eye?
Matt: "I don't recall. I've met people missing many limbs and parts of their body. Kind of happens; it' a dangerous place, the deserts in Marquet. But there are also many people that live there."
Liam: And you're sure we can't talk you into going? Percy's giving out titles.
Taliesin: I am absolutely not!
Matt: "I have no interest in titles. I just wish to stay alive. I'm sorry. I am much more of use to you here, I assure you. I would be a perpetually nervous paranoid wreck if I were to come with you."
Laura: I can't even imagine you like that.
Matt: "Good. We'll keep it that way."
Marisha: Jarett, was there still a control of water going on while you were there?
Matt: "Yes, for many long years, yes. The oasis is built around."
Marisha: Is there anything we should know about that?
Matt: "Well, most of it's controlled in the River District. A number of canals begin in the River District. This is where there is the spring, the perpetual oasis that fuels the city, and many of the caravans that travel to and from."
Travis: Perpetual oasis.
Matt: "Yes."
Travis: Source of power. (laughter)
Sam: Good note-taking, Grog. How do people greet each other there in Ank'Harel? Is there a "Kord's strength be with you" thing?
Matt: "There is 'be pleased,' with a small bow, preferably with the hand down towards the stomach, with the hand out. Be pleased."
Laura: Be pleased.
Travis: Beep-bleep.
Liam: Bleep-bleep, yes. No stealing. Got it.
Sam: Water is valuable.
Laura: Don't drink the water.
Liam: Is there anything that's offensive? We don't want to offend anyone by accident.
Matt: "To be honest, anything you do will offend somebody in the right place, right time, but people are pretty laid back in Ank'Harel, as long as you follow the rules. It's a beautiful city. I'm actually excited for you to see it. I'm very proud of it, had I not made some mistakes."
Liam: Can we bring you anything back?
Matt: "You know what? If you can, there is a special spice that is harvested not far from the city. If you could find me some fusaka spice? Bring me a small-- not a lot, just a bit."
Travis: Is it for food?
Matt: "It's for food, yes."
Liam: I would love to do that. We'll keep an eye out.
Matt: "It's a bit pricey. I can give you some--"
All: No!
Liam: No, you've done way too much for us.
Taliesin: Fair trade.
Liam: Fair trade.
Matt: "All right. Well, I appreciate it."
Laura: Be pleased.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: We'll work on it.
Matt: "Work on it for a bit, maybe watch some folks. You'll pick it up right quick, just pay attention."
Sam: All right, well, shall we--
Taliesin: Let's go change, and then let's be off.
Matt: "All right, be safe, friends. Look forward to your return."
Laura: Keep everyone safe?
Matt: "That is my purpose."
Marisha: And Jarett, will you keep an eye on Gilmore for us?
Matt: "Is he all right?"
Marisha: I think he's just working himself a bit much.
Liam: Stretched a little thin.
Matt: "I may have noticed it myself. I will do this for you. Promise."
Marisha: Thank you.
Matt: "My pleasure."
Sam: To Marquet?
Travis: To market!
Sam: To buy a fine pig.
Marisha: To market!
Sam: Home again, home again.
Laura: I didn't realize Marquet was like Emon. This might be a bit difficult, to find a one-eyed merchant in a city bigger than Emon.
Taliesin: I think that once we arrive, he'll find us. Or she.
Laura: This is true.
Sam: We get there, we start poking people in the eye until someone doesn't flinch, then we'll know we found them.
Taliesin: Can I point out that now we have to learn an entirely new lore? We've worked so hard, and now spices? Rivers, canals, fusaka! Oh god, I'd gotten everything together, and now.
Laura: We've only got two weeks. Fuck.
Taliesin: It takes a day to do Disneyland.
Sam: Does anyone speak Marquetian, or do they speak Common there?
Taliesin: We'll run into a lot of Common. Common is common for a reason.
Sam: All right, let's go.
Matt: All right, you guys head back to Gilmore's place?
Laura: Oh, but are we going to get some water jugs and shit like that before we leave?
Sam: Sure, we get some water jugs.
Marisha: Yeah, more water's good.
Matt: You can pick up a few. We'll say for about five gold pieces here, you can acquire some jugs that are compact enough that they'll actually fit within the Bag of Holding, should you place them.
Liam: Five gold. Mark it off. (laughter)
Taliesin: Wow!
Sam: How we doing on potions? We got potions?
Laura: We need to get some potions.
Travis: There's no stores.
Matt: The healing potions that were available in the city you guys have already taken.
Marisha: Yeah, we've tapped them out there.
Taliesin: Yeah, Whitestone is not functioning.
Sam: All right, we'll get some in Marquet.
Taliesin: Trade them for water.
Travis: One for each?
Taliesin: You stabbed her bear while maintaining eye contact.
Laura: How many jugs did we get? Five jugs?
Matt: Five jugs.
Marisha: Slowly. Very slowly. Oh yeah.
Laura: And we fill up our wineskins with water.
Taliesin: We're changing out of the winters into the lighter clothing.
Marisha: I bust out some of my clothes from the Fire Ashari. Go lighter.
Taliesin: It's a shame Kit's very busy, or else we could get summer clothes.
Matt: She's so busy getting married or something.
Taliesin: Getting married or something.
Liam: I break into a cold sweat, thinking about the desert and this armor. Oh shit.
Laura: You're going to be a gross, sweaty, greasy mess.
Taliesin: Okay, actually there is a solution for this.
Liam: Yes, Percival. I have never needed your intellect more than right now. What is the solution?
Taliesin: I'm going to find him a white silk and cotton, linen cloak, very simple, to throw over his armor the way the Templars used to do, so you won't cook in your bloody armor.
Marisha: Does his little sachet--
Taliesin: Yes, it'll attach to the sachet.
Marisha: Well, I was going to say, does his sachet need a re-up of herbs? I thought you stuffed it with something.
Matt: Percival presents you with a nice, flowing, light whitish-gray cloak. Ceremonial, within older Whitestone gatherings. It seems nice; it seems light.
Liam: And I can put it over everything else?
Laura: Over your other cloaks.
Liam: Cloaks, plural. Fucking 90 episodes later cloaks, cloaks, cloaks.
Matt: You can totally place it over your Displacer Cloak.
Taliesin: Yeah. It's just a heat sink.
Liam: Yeah, it's to bounce the heat off.
Laura: Perfect.
Liam: Liam knows science. Vax doesn't know shit.
Matt: All right. What's the plan?
Sam: Before we go, quickly, guys. I'm sorry. I haven't done this yet, so can I try to see where Kaylie is and do a little scry?
Matt: You close your eyes and concentrate, and you see, peeking out from the metallic rim of the sword which you gave her, the Aberration's Bane longsword, you look up and you can see the edge of a wooden table. You hear faint music in the distance; it sounds like some sort of a piano being played. No accompaniment, just a straight piano. You hear distant whispers of conversation, the occasional burst of laughter, and you can see the edge of Kaylie's elbow, leaning against the edge of the table. There's a long pause, no movement. Then all of a sudden, she shifts back from the table and goes, "That's right, all the money on the table's mine. Nice try." Scoops down, throwing her hand of cards on the table. You hear a couple voices go (groaning). You see her scoop the coins over and go place them into a coin bag. "All right, so perhaps another round, then?"
Sam: Yeah! She's doing good!
Matt: "Where are you going? Are you a coward or something?" Shouting this in the distance, as apparently the previous people she card sharked walk off, frustrated and growling. You see one of them comes up to the edge of the table and goes, "Best be giving that money back, little girl or you're--" Before that happens, you see a large, meaty hand grab the back of his neck and pick up him by the scruff. You see appear into view the very edge of Dr. Dranzel's chin and hat and he goes, "I'm sorry, were you talking to my lady friend that way? That's poor manners." And drops him there at the table. The guy adjusts himself. "Better not see you guys in the street." He walks off. She reaches her hand up, watching the guy leave, and fist-bumps Dranzel. Your vision fades back and your consciousness comes back to you.
Sam: She's okay! Okay, good! All right! I feel good. Let's go!
Liam: What were you doing?
Sam: I had some bad tikka masala earlier.
Liam: We haven't even gone to Marquet!
Sam: They don't have Middle Eastern food there, I hope!
Taliesin: Well...
Liam: Not going to touch that one.
Travis: Are we going?
Liam: Let's go.
Taliesin: Let's go.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way back towards Gilmore's home. At this point in time, you come in and find there are a couple of plates, crumbs to the side. Gilmore's sitting in the chair with his tea, eyes closed in a meditative stance. As soon as you enter the room, he jolts back to momentary awareness. "All right! Gathered your things? Are you ready to go?"
Liam: Pretty much.
Matt: "If you don't mind." He grabs the edge of the central table in the center of the room with the tea on it. He looks towards you.
Travis: Oh yeah, no problem.
Matt: You guys shift it, move it to the side, leaving an open space on the ground. He kneels down and places one hand in the center of the floor. The other hand he reaches back into a small pouch on his side and pulls out a small amount of shimmering, glassy sand material you recognize as a hint of residuum processed into its dust crystallized form. He scatters it around while he's muttering under his breath. As he does, with his hand in the center, you see the dust pull together into these small symbols on their own, almost like magnets to iron filings. They're forming into these rigid structures. As they do, they begin to flare up and glow, and he takes a step back, his eyes still closed, brings his fist together into a grip. As he does, they light up, and you recognize this as a teleportation circle. He goes, "All right, it won't last long. In you go!"
Travis: Running through!
Laura: Thank you, Gilmore!
Matt: "My pleasure!" is the last thing you hear before you dive in as it begins to fade. Each of you guys step into and transition past, immediately piling up into each other as you come out the other side, as you're in a dark and enclosed cupboard or closet-type circumstance.
Taliesin: I'm reaching for a door handle.
Laura: Anywhere.
Matt: It looks like there is a set of doors to it. It's a giant armoire. You guys are pushed into it, but it is latched over.
Liam: Ugh, Grog's pec is right in my eye.
Laura: Can I get a little dagger through and flip the latch?
Matt: Flick it up. It bursts open, and you all come stumbling out.
Liam: I think he stabbed my eye out! Jeez!
Matt: As you all stop, Vex, you look back around. This is a very large dresser-like armoire. It's empty. It looks like there are a number of hangers inside, like it was a place for various outfits to be kept and stored. On the floor of the wood, you can see carved into it a small symbol or a sigil, if you will.
Sam: Drink!
Laura: Drink!
Matt: Marked as the symbol he put.
Laura: Good thing no one destroyed this thing while he was gone.
Matt: Glancing around, you can see a small dark wood room atop a wine-red circular carpet in the center. Empty shelves and cobwebs fill the corners. There's a bit of dust and sand coating over where the bed rests against the wall. A closed window hides behind a drawn curtain, with a little bit of peeking sunlight making its way through. There is one single door that sees you out, though it is currently closed.
Taliesin: I'm going to stand on the carpet and will it to fly. Seems worth a shot.
Laura: Every carpet here.
Matt: Step onto the carpet, close your eyes. How do you will it?
Taliesin: I do believe in fairies. I do believe in fairies. I know it; I've killed several of them. They're definitely real.
Matt: Moments pass, no effect.
Liam: I'm going to do my due diligence and make sure the door's okay. Probably is, but just in case.
Taliesin: I'm going to look out the window, as well.
Laura: I look under the bed.
Liam: 22. Just to make sure that it's not trapped or locked.
Matt: The door is locked. It is not trapped. You're peeking out the window, you said?
Taliesin: Yeah, I am.
Matt: You glance through the cloth, and it looks like it is a glass window, but it is partially opened and looks like there's a little cluster of sand that's gathered over time underneath the sill, from what little bit the wind's pushed through. Glancing out as soon as you push out, the light is very bright, and you have to take a moment for your eyes to adjust. Looking out, you see a simple street. There are some small buildings built of fine wood; nothing too extravagant. You can see a number of trees that protrude from the sand: long, tall, thin, palm frond-type tops to them, bearing some sort of large nut-like fruit. You can see what look to be small troughs of gathered water, whether it be from rain or them placed there intentionally, but they're currently locked with some semi-translucent top and chained shut, on the outside of two of the buildings. You do see a few people walking back up and down the street. General civilians, all dressed in longer, full-body robes, some of them with scarves around their neck. I wouldn't say peasants, per se, but definitely not well-off in their appearance. Casual civilians. Darker skin, looks like they've definitely been living in the desert for a long time. That is what you can see from the window's point of view.
Taliesin: Are we on the first floor or second floor?
Matt: Currently, you're on the first floor.
Sam: Is there a second floor?
Matt: You don't know.
Sam: Are there stairs? Oh, we're in a room. Let's go out the room. What could happen?
Matt: Looking under the bed, you see what appears to be a small wooden box that is closed and hidden toward the very back, and what appears to be a small series of shirts that have been folded up and have gathered a lot of dust over the top of them.
Laura: Can I reach them?
Matt: Yeah. Pull them out. Really nice, high-quality silk and cotton based, embroidered shirts. Look more ceremonial, special event type, long, maybe knee-length.
Marisha: What's the decoration like in the room?
Matt: Currently, it's pretty bland. You can see a couple of colored tapestries similar to the center of the floor rug that are hanging, but there are a lot of blank areas. It looks like decorations have been removed, or at least haven't been there for a long time. The room, for the most part, seems to be abandoned.
Laura: Is the box trapped?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Almost good, and then not. 14.
Matt: 14? It does not appear to be trapped.
Laura: Can I open it?
Matt: You do. Open it up, glance inside. It looks to be a series of folded papers.
Laura: Is it Gilmore's stuff?
Liam: Yeah, you're going through Shaun's shit. What are you doing?
Laura: I'm just seeing if this is his room!
Marisha: Ooh, whispers.
Travis: Oh shitballs. I have to move.
Marisha: How are those Cowboys doing, Travis?
Travis: Ten-ten, halftime.
Marisha: Oh snap.
Taliesin: Is that a good thing, ten-ten at halftime?
Travis: No, not good.
Taliesin: That's not good? Okay.
Travis: Their starting quarterback got hurt.
Taliesin: I understood all those words individually.
Travis: Because he's an old woman.
Taliesin: I know those words, as well.
Liam: Speaking in Half-Orc. Don't speak that.
Taliesin: I would pay good money to have you explain how football works to me.
Travis: That's what I was going with that!
Laura: Okay. I fold them back up and I put them under the bed.
Liam: Can I read your diary, then? Is that all right?
Laura: I was seeing if we were in Gilmore's room, that's all.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: All right.
Laura: Don't act like I'm a dick. I'm not stealing the letters. I'm putting the shirts back, all right?
Liam: I didn't say it! Just maybe he wants a little privacy. I don't know! Think about it.
Marisha: She's learned from you well.
Laura: Is the door open? Can we go out of here?
Sam: Did you find anything good?
Liam: If 25 opens the door, then it's opened.
Matt: It's easy enough, like butter. (creaking door) The door opens.
Marisha: He did say we would meet his family.
Matt: As the door opens up, immediately, your nose catches the smell of sage and cooked meats. As the door opens, you look into a large room to your left with some furniture, not too extravagant, but nice, and a humble living space. As the door opens the other way, you look to the right, and you see two figures sitting at a table, seemingly eating. An older couple, with dark sun-weathered skin, graying hair, and bright eyes. They look confused and slightly scared at their table, staring back at people wandering into the middle of the room.
Travis: It's okay.
Marisha: Hi!
Taliesin: This is a bit awkward.
Sam: We're friends of Gilmore.
Laura: Shaun.
Matt: They both look at each other.
Sam: Oh, be pleased.
Travis: Bees knees.
Matt: They both look to each other and then immediately begin, mouths filled with food, laughing. (laughs) "This is unexpected. Friends of Shaun's, you say?"
All: Yes.
Matt: The man himself stands up and begins to walk over, wiping the edge of his mouth with a small piece of cloth, finishing chewing and swallowing the food he has currently. As he walks up, the man has thinning white hair that grows long, straight down towards his back, simple long robe-like dress with simple cloth pants that go round these slipper-like shoes on his feet. He approaches. Which one said Shaun?
Sam: You said Gilmore.
Matt: Gilmore and Shaun. Approaches you, as you, stepping forward as one of the more, you know, assertive members of the party, and goes, "How is he? If you could please tell me?"
Laura: He's quite well. He's very powerful, actually, and has wonderful businesses, all through--
Marisha: Tal'Dorei?
Laura: No, I know. It's just not there anymore.
Matt: "Opesa. Opesa, come." And the woman gets up from the table. "Yes, I'm sorry. It has been a while since we've had guests from so strange and sudden arrivals!" She walks up and pulls these small glasses out from her pocket and puts them on. You can see her eyes open up wide behind them, and she comes, leans to the side and puts her arm around him. They both hold each other. He goes, "I am sorry. Let me introduce. I am Soren Geddmore. This is Opesa Geddmore. You know our son?"
Liam: Yes, for quite some time.
Matt: "And you say he does well with his business?"
Laura: He does. So well, yes.
Taliesin: Continental.
Matt: "This is good."
Laura: Very respected.
Liam: Yes, and brave.
Matt: "He has always been a brave one."
Sam: Single-handedly protecting a whole city right now.
Matt: "You don't have to embellish. That's okay. Would you like to eat with us? We can make more food, yes?"
Laura: Actually, we need to head out pretty quickly.
Taliesin: We're sadly on a mission.
Laura: Can you tell us the direction to Ank'Harel?
Matt: "You are going to Ank'Harel?"
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Yes. Follow me." He takes her by the arm, and they both walk arm-in-arm, leading you guys to what looks to be a front door of this abode. As he pushes it open, revealing more of the street of this small oasis town, he goes, "Let's see, if you follow-- that is the sun." He looks up, and you see his eyes adjust to the brighter sky. "The sun is there. It will be setting... that direction. Continue... what is the word you speak?"
Sam: North, northwest. No, northeast.
Matt: "That is west. You want to north, so go that way. Yes. That is where you want to go."
Laura: Thank you.
Sam: Is there a road to follow, or is it just a direction?
Matt: "I haven't been in many years. As far as I know, there are signs. There are not roads. There are guides you could hire to bring you there."
Marisha: Can I do like a nature check or take note of what he said so I remember? Because that was vague.
Laura: I'm assuming these are the people that Gilmore said I would know.
Matt: You get the sense these are probably who he was referring to.
Laura: Yes, so as she's doing that, I want to pull out the locket and say, actually, Shaun asked me to deliver this to you.
Matt: "What--" And he looks to his wife. The woman steps forward adjusting her glasses. "Thank you so much!" She holds it and opens it up. Looks over to him and shows him. You get a bit of a glance, at that point. You can see it's a picture of Gilmore. He's happy. Jewel-encrusted rings. It's almost a promotional still, if there was one, for Gilmore's Glorious Goods. She takes it. She closes it and goes, "Gilmore is originally Geddmore. He changed his name when he went for better business to the Tal'Dorei place. Glad he's doing well."
Taliesin: He's respected across the continent.
Liam: Is there anything we can let him know?
Matt: "Give him our love and tell him he is more than welcome to visit. It has been many years."
Liam: We will.
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: "Not a worry. Safe travels. You're sure you don't wish to have food?"
Liam: No, but if you could point us towards fusaka? Is there any around here? There's not, is there?
Matt: They both look at each other. "I'm not familiar with this spice you speak of. My apologies." She's like, "I'm sorry. I do not know this fusaka you speak of."
Liam: He's pulling our chain.
Sam: Or maybe it's something illicit.
Laura: It's possible.
Taliesin: It's possible.
Sam: Or something that you snort.
Liam: He's pretty cool.
Laura: I understand.
Taliesin: Can we leave them a bit of water?
Sam: Yeah, we should leave them some water.
Laura: Oh yes.
Sam: Grog! Water boy?
Travis: Yes?
Laura: Can you give them some water from our jug?
Taliesin: Where do you keep your personal water?
Laura: Would you like some water?
Travis: I got it. Here, take this jug of water with our compliments. You said give them a jug!
Taliesin: Where do you store your water in the house?
Matt: "We have, around this way--" He leads you towards the back of this small kitchen. It's very condensed. You can see there is a high metal fence, and there appears to be a rainwater receptacle there, like a well that is built into the homestead. It has chains over the top. He begins to pull keys out and lock to it, and as he pulls off the chains one by one, he pulls back the lid, this hard, dry wooden lid, and within it is a very deep well, though it looks like the water level's maybe ten feet down from the top of the well right now.
Travis: You want me to pour the Alchemy Jug in here? Or just one of the little ones?
Taliesin: Pour the Alchemy. The little one's for us today. The Alchemy Jug, this is where it's going.
Travis: All right, I take the Alchemy Jug and I go: You want to see a trick? Look inside. Do you see anything?
Matt: "Hey, Opesa, do you see anything?" And she blinks a bit. "No, it's empty."
Travis: And I say  Now, give it a listen. And I shake it. What do you hear?
Matt: "Nothing. You are a strange man." (laughter)
Travis: Forgot they're old. Right, well, it sounds-- fuck it. Water. And I start pouring. (laughter)
Matt: How much water does it create?
Travis: It creates eight gallons of fresh water.
Matt: Oh wow. "You are still a very strange man, but I'm very happy and appreciative."
Travis: I am a great sorcerer.
Matt: "All right. I can see, now. Gilmore has his work cut out for him."
Travis: Gedd-e-mo-ray.
Matt: He pats your shoulder. "Geddmore, indeed." As you finish pouring the water out, they lead you guys back to the front.
Laura: What time is it here?
Matt: He pulls out a small sundial from his pocket, holds it up. "It would be closer to late afternoon."
Laura: No, we aren't going to make it to Ank'Harel by dark. Yes, of course. That's all. Thank you!
Matt: "Well, thank you so much for coming."
Taliesin: Good day.
Travis: Beep-beep!
Sam: Be pleased.
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Liam: Be pleased.
Matt: "Be pleased." And they both, in a very rusty joints way, give you both a bow as you leave.
Liam: They were a couple of sweethearts.
Sam: They are adorable! They're both over 70, so who's going to kill them? Should Grog, or should I?
Taliesin: I think it's our turn.
Laura: You broke him!
Sam: You kill one, I'll kill the other.
Liam: Throwback Thursday.
Taliesin: This is what a d10 is for. Hold on, one second.
Marisha: Do we have any more reason to be here? Or should we start heading off to Ank'Harel?
Taliesin: I think we head off to Ank'Harel.
Laura: Yeah, unless we see any kind of potion shops here.
Marisha: I can mist us. I brought it today.
Taliesin: Oh. We can mist.
Liam: Is there enough moisture in the air? I have no idea how it works.
Travis: Shit, if we evaporate, I'll be so pissed.
Marisha: Wait. Can that happen?
Travis: You don't know!
Taliesin: I think it'll be fine.
Marisha: Because we're mist.
Taliesin: We're mostly water. I think it's our water. I think we end up very dehydrated at the end of it.
Marisha: Sorry, I just spit all over you. I'm sorry.
Taliesin: It's okay. Now I'm moister.
Marisha: That's how mist form works.
Travis: Now I'm moisture.
Marisha: I don't think we'd evaporate. I think he's fucking with us. I don't think we'd evaporate.
Laura: Let's mist it.
Matt: That would be the saddest TPK ever. "Let's go, guys!" And so ends the journey of Vox Machina. (laughter)
Marisha: They fade into existence!
Laura: That would be the worst thing ever.
Taliesin: Was that a global warming metaphor?
Travis: No songs to be sung. Just fucking another cloud in the fucking sky.
Sam: Some say you can see them still, overhead. (laughter)
Marisha: I don't think we'll evaporate.
Laura: Let's do it.
Sam: We're going to mist it?
Marisha: Do we need anything else while we're here, before I do this?
Taliesin: It's a one-camel town.
Marisha: I mist us.
Matt: All right. As you guys take a moment to concentrate, each one of you transforms into mist. As you begin to go one by the other, you do hear a couple of (gasps). You glance over your shoulder to see three kids, all looking up at you all with these big, scared smiles.
Marisha: Before I go, I say  stay in school, kids. And then I mist.
Taliesin: I'm going to Slimer the kid.
Laura: As I turn into mist, I go  I'm melting! Melting! Oh, what a world!
Matt: Make a deception check.
Marisha: I was trying to inspire them!
Taliesin: You're a terrible person!
Laura: 20.
Liam: Do they speak Common?
Matt: After you give your presentation, they, "Whoa!" As you begin transforming, you do that and they go, (terrified screaming) and go running indoors.
Taliesin: I'm still going to slime them on their way out.
Marisha: Sliming them!
Sam: We're tormenting children.
Liam: Hey, that's a step up for us!
Matt: That's what Vox Machina is all about.
Taliesin: Scarring children for life.
Travis: If you can't kill the old, terrify the young.
Taliesin: We're leaving them with a promise that we'll be back to finish the job.
Matt: You are terrible people. You guys rise into the air as the sun begins to bring itself to set in the west. You shift up over the city. You look down. Probably maybe 150, 200 buildings make up the entirety of Shandal. It's not a very large town, but you can see little dots of moving caravans both to and from the city. It is a fairly lively stop for people traveling to and from Ank'Harel.
Taliesin: We can follow traffic.
Marisha: Follow traffic.
Taliesin: There's a traffic line, then.
Matt: Every now and then. As you follow the direction they're going, you're traveling much faster than they are. The hot air does feel a little uncomfortable against your cloud-based misty forms, but you do not feel like it's responsible for evaporating any of your form.
Marisha: Yeah, we're just sweating a little bit more.
Matt: You're like, "oh this is uncomfortable." You continue to press forward as the sun slowly begins to set. The temperature begins to get colder and colder, and the sky grows darker.
Marisha: Do we condense a little bit? Turn into a low-lying fog? Never mind.
Matt: If you'd like to. It's up to you entirely. The form is your choice.
Travis: Could we turn into a marine layer?
Matt: You continue to travel throughout the night?
Sam: How long does this thing last?
Laura: Eight hours, right? It lasts eight hours?
Sam: We'll travel eight hours.
Taliesin: We'll take a late night. Once it wears off, then we'll camp.
Laura: Can we get the whole way there?
Marisha: Wind Walk, you said it was a day's journey, and we can travel faster by Wind Walking.
Sam: At night, will we know where northeast is?
Laura: Yeah, I've got an excellent sense of direction.
Taliesin: If it's only a day's travel, at some point we're going to see the city.
Marisha: I think we should be able to get there, right?
Laura: And we can camp just outside the city, maybe?
Sam: Okay. Let's do it.
Marisha: Because we have a flying speed of 300 feet.
Matt: Yes, you guys cruise. You guys push forward for another four to five hours post-dusk. You're now hitting the early hours of the morning before you begin to see in the distance hundreds of sparking lights begin to appear up above a distant sand dune. You can see the lit lights, lanterns, and general glowing night life of a massive city over the high walls that surround its exterior. This is a pretty amazing sight for those of you who have not been to such a large desert atmosphere, and it is pitch black below you, and at the height you're traveling-- How high are you traveling versus the ground? I guess I should ask.
Taliesin: 300 feet?
Marisha: An appropriate cloud height.
Sam: That's thousands.
Marisha: Hundreds. A couple hundred feet.
Matt: Okay. From this view, you can see a large queue about eight heavy caravan carts long of caravans that have camped for the night outside of the front main gates. You do see, along the line of the outer wall, there appear to be a number of small spires that open up like guard tower parapets that come to a pointed, what looks like a hand, cradling the outside of each section of the wall on the outside, but on the inside, you see a hundred or more of these long, multi-level spires that progress all throughout the city, and it goes on and on in its large oval-like shape. It's hard to make out much color other than the thousand small lights you see throughout the entire city. Orange, yellows, greens, blues. It is a beautiful view. What is your plan?
Taliesin: I say we camp outside.
Liam: Are we still clouds, though?
Taliesin: We're still clouds.
Liam: Can't talk at all.
Laura: Should we mist down?
Sam: Are we getting to the end of our eight hours anyway?
Marisha: It's been five or six.
Laura: It's still night?
Matt: Still night, yes.
Laura: It's good to camp.
Matt: It's two in the morning, at this point.
Marisha: Does there look like any patch of shrubs or a low point in the terrain? Cover.
Matt: You can't tell from this height, unfortunately.
Laura: We mist down a little bit.
Matt: You scoot down around the outside of the city walls. The landscape here near the town appears to be more packed and hardened badland dust and sand. You can see where lots of it, from a recent rain, have caked and hardened and then broken in places. It leaves this soft, shale-type texture to it that breaks into sand upon crumbling underfoot. From what you can see, there are a number of various heights of dunes in the distance. This city is thrown right in the center of what appears to be hundreds of miles of desert from the view that you had as the sun was setting.
Laura: And the gates to the city are closed at night?
Matt: The gates to the city are closed from this perspective, yes.
Liam: We did it, you guys. We made it to Burning Man.
Matt: You guys timed this, I didn't.
Laura: Can we see guards around? Do they look aggressive?
Matt: The giant iron gates stand about 65 feet tall and about as wide from end to end. They have a very tight weave of iron bars between them, to where it's almost a very thick fencing that you can almost see through. You can just see the outline of things that walk back and forth behind it. However, on the front side, you can see a number of guards.
Laura: We can see your piece of paper on the screen. Still see it.
Matt: Stop looking at my piece of paper on the screen!
Liam: There's a Vestige!
Matt: Not actually. Not anymore, it's not! It's gone! All right. Amongst the carved-out circle of caravan carts and people that are camping overnight before entering the city, you do see what appear to be a dozen guards, all dressed in dark blue and dark reddish metallic armor, many carrying heavy scimitars to their side or long pikes and shields. They're all wearing intricate helmets that crest down past the nose to the point where it looks like they just have eyes and a lower jaw. It flares out at the bottom and then curves to a point right across where the clavicle would be. The armor itself is designed in a very beautiful ornate fashion, but also looks very functional. You're at a distance; they don't seem to have noticed you as you've all crested down still in your cloud forms.
Laura: We should probably land far away.
Taliesin: I'm going to de-mist. There seems to be a section where people are camping. Let's just, for once, take this by the book. We want to make sure they know we're here. No sneaking into the city.
Marisha: I don't think they'd take kindly to surprises.
Taliesin: At worst, we've got the pretense of being emissaries from Emon looking for help.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: They punish people for nicking things. I don't think we want to try to break in.
Taliesin: No. we're going to try and be truthful as much as possible, although nobody say the W word.
Travis: Wine?
Laura: Wine, definitely wine.
Marisha: I'm assuming that that's the Hand of Ord that we're looking at.
Sam: The Hand of Ord is supposed to be super secret.
Taliesin: It might just be guards.
Matt: The Hand of Ord isn't secret.
Marisha: No, he said the Hand of Ord is the name of the peacekeeping guards.
Taliesin: Yes, that's right.
Laura: All right!
Taliesin: Let's camp for the evening.
Laura: Shall we camp in the mansion, then?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: So comfortable.
Sam: Sure.
Liam: We're still a distance though? Where we are, from the guards?
Laura: Yeah. We're off a little bit.
Matt: How far are you guys? How far did you decide to stop and transform? That's up to you.
Liam: I don't know.
Taliesin: Where were the other people camping for the night?
Matt: They're maybe 40 feet from the gates.
Taliesin: Well, let's camp 40 feet. Let's camp with them.
Travis: You want to put a magical door 40 feet?
Taliesin: I'm perfectly okay. It's not like they can come in. No one can enter who can't be invited.
Liam: You want to make a mystical door floating in the middle of their tents?
Laura: Do the people seem friendly? Do they seem tired?
Taliesin: We're going to camp next to their campsite.
Matt: Make a perception check
Liam: In this world, on the ground? I love it. We haven't done it that much lately.
Taliesin: We've been too used to being careful.
Marisha: In the mansion.
Laura: 22.
Marisha: So not really camping. We're glamping.
Matt: At a safe distance, you can make out some detail, and there is some lantern light on top of some of these carts. It appears that a number of the folks have set up small tents, and most appear to be sleeping. There are a few guards that are set on top of the carts with crossbows resting over their lap, keeping an eye in case anyone decides to get too close to their wares throughout the evening.
Laura: How about we keep a distance?
Marisha: Yeah, let's not mist down in the middle of a group.
Laura: No, let's keep a distance from them and be another group of people coming into the city.
Travis: I'd say 200 yards out.
Liam: Percival said he already un-misted.
Marisha: We're deciding how far. So 200 yards.
Taliesin: I can re-mist.
Liam: We can all do that?
Taliesin: As long as the eight hours hasn't passed, we can go in and out as you please, isn't that correct?
Matt: Yeah. It takes you a minute to transform.
Sam: Should we use our misting while we have it and mist into the city?
Travis: That's what I said, but they punish crime so harshly.
Sam: We haven't committed any crime.
Laura: No, but they have to document who goes in and out.
Sam: They won't even know--
Liam: Scan-man, let's start by playing nice, please.
Marisha: And if we get caught, they're going to know we didn't sign in correctly.
Taliesin: They have giant spires, yeah, and they're going to say "who are you?" and we're not going to be on the list.
Liam: We know nothing about these people or the customs here.
Travis: Yeah, we've got to learn a little bit before we kill all of them.
Marisha: I don't see any trees, and those guards look heavily funded. That looks like expensive armor they're all wearing.
Taliesin: You've got a good eye, yes.
Laura: Can we have the mansion, Scanlan?
Sam: Sure, yes, we can do the mansion.
Taliesin: Get close enough to the other group that they are aware that we exist, but they couldn't quite make us out, so just another group of travelers camping for the night.
Liam: With a door floating in the air.
Taliesin: It's magic. It's not like they've never seen it before.
Matt: The light radius beyond the wall itself is not very strong. It only low-lights maybe a 30- to 40-foot area around the gate itself, and there are a series of small torches that appear to be ever-burning on the outside of the wall. There are a few campfires that have been set up by the caravans that are waiting amongst the sand and broken ground there. They give a little more light. As you guys get to the outskirts of this, your shapes becoming visible to those that are keeping watch, you see a few individuals stand up on their carts with their crossbows at the ready. Just have a seat and keep an eye bead on those of you that are visible. Doesn't appear to be any aggressive action, just an acknowledgement of your presence and a show of readiness should any aggressive action be taken.
Liam: I'm going to not say anything but do the "be pleased" motion.
Laura: He already did that.
Liam: Well, I'm doing it, as well.
Laura: I'm going to watch you do it.
Sam: So we've un-misted. Are we going to mansion and go to sleep?
Taliesin: We're going to mansion. It's 2 00am. It's time to mansion and go to sleep.
Sam: All right. We'll do that.
Marisha: Okay, the people who are camping, what do they look like? Pretty common folk, I'm assuming?
Matt: Best you tell at this distance, the few that you can see-- because a lot of them appear to be in small tents encamped-- the few that you do make out appear to be dressed in a little more wealthy attire than the people you encountered in Shandal. You can see the gentlemen and ladies that are guarding the encampment are dressed in functional leathers with hints of hide and metal plates incorporated in the defense, but nothing that shows overt wealth or overt destitution. General mercenary guardians for a traveling caravan.
Marisha: Okay. Are we going to talk to any of them?
Taliesin: Unless there's a brazenly loud group around one of the campfires.
Matt: At this hour? No. You get the sense, looking at the surroundings of the campfires, it looks like some sort of party or gathering may have transpired earlier in the evening, but most everyone have passed out at this time.
Laura: The guards are guarding. Anybody that approaches is a threat.
Sam: Yeah, we'll just go to sleep.
Taliesin: Goodnight, all. I am ready for bed.
Matt: Scanlan?
Sam: I will make the mansion.
Matt: The doorway glows with a faint purple hue. In the distance, you see some of the guards step forward and keep an eye out there. Attention has been gained by the doorway, but none of them are approaching immediately. You guys begin to step into the doorway one by one as three of the guards begin to slowly walk towards the doorway.
Taliesin: I'll go last. It'll be fine.
Marisha: I go in.
Liam: Scanlan, why don't you hang with Percival? I go in.
Travis: Yeah, in.
Laura: I stand in the doorway.
Sam: We going to talk to these people?
Taliesin: We're going to let them know who we are and what we're doing. This is just that we have a very expensive tent.
Sam: Great.
Matt: So with that, Percival, Scanlan, and Vex wait outside the shimmering doorway to Scanlan's magnificent mansion. You see the guards begin to approach. The one at the front, a square-jawed, intense-looking man who looks to be not enjoying his current time schedule as a guard on the outside of the southern gates of Ank'Harel approaches, hand at the side clutching some sort of weapon that he has currently sheathed. "May I ask the business of this strange conjuration you've brought at this hour of the night?"
Taliesin: It is our very expensive tent.
Sam: Be pleased.
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Laura: Be pleased.
Matt: Make a persuasion check, Percy.
Taliesin: That'll do. 23. Yeah, 24 actually. 24!
Matt: "I do not know of the nature of this magic that you bring, but I recommend that you keep it outside of the city."
Taliesin: Oh, yes, of course.
Laura: Wait, is magic not allowed within the city?
Matt: "Oh, magic is allowed, but this is unknown to us, and unknown magic is a dangerous magic."
Taliesin: I thank you for your advice. We will heed it well. What is your name, sir?
Matt: "It does not matter. We have 12 crossbows trained on this doorway, and will for the remainder of the evening. Should anything strange happen, we will not hesitate but to fire."
Taliesin: The strangest thing you will see this evening will be us.
Matt: "Good."
Laura: Thank you for the warning.
Matt: Turns around and walks back to the gate.
Taliesin: That could not have gone better.
Travis: (singing) We've got to kill everybody. (laughter)
Laura: Magic is allowed, but this is strange magic. How will we know what isn't strange magic?
Taliesin: Everything we can do is strange magic. Be prepared that not being from around here is going to be trouble.
Marisha: Yeah, I think we're just strange.
Laura: I hold the door open.
Liam: We've had old magic, new magic, strange magic.
Matt: This is all the new schools of magic.
Sam: We go in.
Matt: You guys go in. Mansion's prepared, servants are at your ready, beds are freshly fluffed. Damaged kitchens are rearranged to have been not touched at all.
Travis: What?!
Laura: Wonderful.
Sam: I love it.
Matt: You are able to rest for the evening as you prepare for your next day entering the city of Ank'Harel itself.
Taliesin: I make my way, quietly in the night, to Grog's room. I was just kidding, sorry!
Travis: (laughing) I was like, "come get some, bitch!"
Laura: No, I want to go to sleep, and I'm holding on to Fenthras and thinking about everything.
Matt: Mulling over the events that recently transpired and digesting all the questions you still have.
Taliesin: I gave you a lot to think about, didn't I? Sorry. (laughs)
Sam: I play a card game by myself.
Matt: Okay. As you guys have a restful night, we're going to take a break. We'll be back here in a few minutes, and we'll pick this up in the following morning as they enter the city itself. See you in a minute! [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone! Returning from the break, Vox Machina has an evening of rest in Scanlan's magnificent mansion. You come to consciousness the following morning, stationed within the beautiful confines of this magical mansion, unaware directly of what awaits you on the other side of the doorway. However, the morning is yours. What do you wish to do?
Liam: I'm going to stealth back to my room.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: No one sees anything.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: No worries. I got a one, but I'll use luck.
Marisha: You're using a luck?
Liam: Two ones!
Taliesin: Two ones!
All: (yelling) Yes!
Taliesin: There is a god, and he hates you!
Marisha: You are so walk of shaming right now. (laughter)
Matt: So as the morning comes about, Vex, you go stretch out of your room, scratching the side of your head, messed up from sleeping wrong on the pillow, and as you walk out you hear (clicking) and look to your right and see your brother slowly slinking away from Keyleth's room.
Laura: (retching) I go back in my room.
Liam: Oh hey, hold on a second, though.
Travis: Oh man. (laughs) Talk it out.
Marisha: Talk it out right now.
Laura: I'm about to throw up.
Liam: No, you make jokes, but I want to go into your room for a second and talk to you.
Travis: Ew! Make him bathe.
Laura: Fine. And I go in my room and I sit down on the opposite side of the room.
Liam: Take a full minute to get over it, you fucker.
Laura: Hold on, it's not been a minute. All right.
Liam: You really should have gone into acting. It really was your calling. Yeah.
Laura: No, I'm happy for you. As foul as it is. What are you doing? What?
Liam: (sighs) Sorry, I'm a little discombobulated. I've never rolled two ones in a row.
Matt: Yeah, that happened.
Laura: Oh, that was so amazing.
Matt: Take that, Luck feat! (laughter)
Liam: I know this is a really stupid time to talk about it, but we never get to talk to each other, and I have a serious question. (nervous laugh) Relax. In that tree, that guy said a lot of fucked-up shit to you, and it just sounded like a lot of fucked-up shit and him trying to make you feel bad, so fuck him, right? Fuck that guy. But he said something about a dagger? And I saw your face fall.
Laura: (soft laugh) Jesus Christ.
Liam: And I asked you if you were all right the other day, and I think you might have not told me the entire truth. Are you all right?
Laura: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Right now?
Liam: I could be dead tomorrow, Vex. Right now.
Laura: He knew a lot of things, yes. I don't think he was completely wrong, and that's what makes me feel terrible.
Liam: About what, about you being shitty? Fuck that guy!
Laura: Well, he was right about the dagger.
Liam: I want you to tell me about the dagger. I want to know about the dagger, but I'm serious, fuck that guy on the rotten branches he was growing out of. He's not right. Your strength of character runs deep. Fuck that guy! It breaks my heart to see you doubt yourself. You have always been a wonderful woman! I'm not saying you have to be a fucking beefcake; you don't have to be a soldier, but--
Laura: That's good, because I am really weak. (laughs)
Liam: Whatever the case, you are a good person. All of them know that. They all know that. None of them doubt it. I don't doubt it. I don't have the words, I just want you to believe me.
Laura: Thank you.
Liam: I'm not eloquent like Percival, but I've known you a long time. You are a good person.
Laura: Thank you. It makes me happy to see you happy.
Liam: Forgot what it feels like.
Laura: Yeah, right?
Liam: What's the dagger?
Laura: Oh, that. Yeah, I killed a couple people and I saved Trinket, that's all.
Liam: When?
Matt: Trinket comes waking up from what was his sleeping stance.
Liam: You'll have to be more specific than that.
Laura: Do you remember when I brought Trinket back to camp?
Liam: Originally?
Laura: Yeah! All those years ago?
Liam: Yes! I thought it was a terrible idea. I was dead wrong.
Laura: (laughs) Well... turns out, I found him in a camp where I'd been taken.
Liam: What?
Laura: Yes, and there was some really dark people there, and they had harvested--
Sam: (sneezes)
Laura: Trinket's mother. Bless you. Is Scanlan in the room?
Liam: The paintings do all have holes cut in the eyes, so you can never be sure.
Laura: I did what I had to do, and I killed them.
Liam: The people that took you.
Laura: Yes. I did.
Liam: The people that took you from me?
Laura: Yes. And I saved Trinket that night, and that's what Saundor saw. More than anything I just... I don't know how he saw it.
Liam: Are you just creeped out because he knew or because of what happened? Why are you upset?
Laura: I'm not.
Liam: Well, listen. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened, but... you came back to me, so whatever happened can't be wrong.
Laura: Right? (sniffles)
Liam: Oh, come here! Come here! If somebody took you from me... I don't know how to see it any other way than I do. You would have to do something really terrible, Vex'ahlia, for me to ever feel disappointment in you, and you have not ringed that bell. Rung it?
Laura: Rung it.
Liam: You studied harder than I did.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Goodness, please. One more time  You are a good person, and I've always seen that. Please see it, please. Oh god, my heart is breaking.
Laura: No! It's good. We all need to self-reflect every once in a while. I needed it. My heart is in the right place. I know it is. I'm just afraid sometimes actions speak louder than intentions. If things I was doing could be read the wrong way, then... maybe I need to change what I do.
Liam: (sighs) You've always been bold. That's not a crime. That's all right.
Laura: It's fine, dear.
Liam: I feel like a boy again.
Laura: (laughs) No, please. I'm so happy to see you happy. Don't worry about me. I'm fine!
Liam: Well, no, but--
Laura: And I can talk to Trinket now. We talk all the time.
Liam: Vex'ahlia.
Laura: We've talked through a lot.
Liam: Vex.
Laura: Right?
Liam: Vex.
Laura: Yes? (laughs)
Liam: Fuck, I'm just going around-- I love you.
Laura: I love you.
Liam: You don't have to talk to me about everything, but if you want to... if you want to. Should you need me.
Laura: "Should you need me."
Liam: All right. Sorry to babble.
Laura: Oh, yeah, no. Maybe go take a shower.
Liam: I'm not going to answer that. I'll see you at breakfast. And I walk away.
Matt: Yeah, you do. All right, as you all find breakfast, a fair prepared chicken feast, as they've been given no other instruction. (laughter)
Travis: Can't we change it up?
Liam: I'm afraid not.
Sam: Change up the food?
Laura: Yeah, maybe something other than chicken.
Sam: Why? It's nutritious. It's delicious.
Travis: Ravioli!
Sam: Ravioli for breakfast? All right.
Laura: Something with veggies?
Sam: Let's do ravioli. Staff?
Matt: "Yes, Scanlan?"
Laura: Oh, they speak?
Travis: Shit, they do talk!
Sam: Could you make us some chicken ravioli?
Liam: You unlocked "Ravioli in Marquet!"
Laura: They're learning.
Travis: They're smart. We have to kill them all!
Taliesin: They're going to learn.
Matt: The servants vanish for about ten minutes and return with a robust meal of bowls and bowls of chicken ravioli.
Travis: Chicken ravioli. (laughs)
Laura: Delicious.
Sam: Yummy.
Travis: Good call.
Taliesin: Adequate.
Matt: Slightly. You finish your meal, feel yourself satiated as much as you can be with chicken ravioli for breakfast. You guys exit, find yourself on the exterior walls of Ank'Harel, the sun blazing down in the early morning, a hotter temperature than you've been used to in quite some time. Would be the equivalent of probably the low 100s Fahrenheit by our standards. All of you with layers of armor, which is all of you except for Grog, immediately feel this is going to be uncomfortable fairly quickly. Grog, you are used to higher colder climates, even without being heavily armored, still fairly uncomfortable.
Travis: Sucks.
Liam: You're really pale, too.
Matt: It's not great. You can see the caravans that you guys were camping loosely next to are no longer there. It looks like there have been a couple of dark spots in the dust and the sand that have been kicked over where the campsites were, where the fires were put out, and tracks of where the carts and wheels have been dragged to and through the gate. You can now see about ten guards that are all stationed at the front of that iron gate on this side of the Ank'Harel wall.
Sam: Well? Should we go in and be traveling people and kill everyone that we see?
Travis: How about you let me take the lead on this?
Laura: How about no?
Sam: What's our angle? We are weary travelers from Tal'Dorei, seeking--
Marisha: I thought we were going into this one with honesty. Thought we agreed to that.
Sam: Seeking help?
Marisha: We're ambassadors from Emon.
Travis: Keyleth, do you really want to be honest or is it a ploy? Do we want to be honest?
Taliesin: The ploy is to be honest.
Marisha: Our normality is dishonesty, so technically we're switching it up.
Laura: This is the ploy.
Taliesin: This is a radical shift.
Marisha: We're not honest, so let's try it for once.
Sam: All right, let's do it. We're from Emon, we need help fighting dragons.
Marisha: I feel like that's pretty compelling.
Matt: Grog, make an intelligence check.
Travis: (laughs) Yeah, thank you. Travis needs to make an intelligence check. Oh Jesus, it's a 12. Minus two.
Matt: You have no idea what they're talking about. You find yourself instinctually nodding.
Sam: We'll just go in, big guy. We'll be fine.
Liam: First chance for violence is all yours. You're the first one in.
Travis: I'm all in. Violence. That's what I came away with.
Marisha: (sighs) We have to be careful with our word choices with him.
Taliesin: We head towards the gate.
Travis: (garbled) This ravioli is delicious, by the way. My compliments to the little purple men.
Sam: They're not men, but yes.
Matt: As you guys approach the outside of the gate, you can see seven of the guards stay behind while three, seemingly the same three that had been keeping a close eye upon your initial approach in the evening, walk up. The same man walks up, now looking a little tired; his day is probably finishing out the rest of his station here at the gate. Approaches, hand still on the side of his sheathed weapon. "So you awaken. You have rested. What is your business here in Ank'Harel?"
Sam: We are weary travelers from Emon, and we have come to seek assistance with the security of our home.
Matt: "What is your contact within the city? Who do you wish to speak to?"
Liam: Go for the top?
Marisha: Oh, that's a really far stretch. The king.
Sam: We are seeking a man called...
Liam: J'mon Sa Ord.
Sam: No, I don't think we want to talk to the king. Do we?
Marisha: Merchant warrior? No, not that one? Who the fuck are we trying to see?
Sam: We would like to talk to J'mon Sa Ord or his or her advisors to seek advice.
Matt: "You come for an audience with the emperor?"
Taliesin: We come for an audience with many people, to be honest. We are looking at many avenues of possible help. Contacts, trade, anything that can help us in our time of dire need.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Sam: Me or him?
Matt: You.
Sam: Oh. Okay. It was a million.
Taliesin: I didn't know that that die went that high.
Sam: 34.
Laura: It's a million.
Matt: His arm relaxes at the side of his weapon, and he looks down upon your diminutive gnomish structure, though glances over at the much larger goliath and back at you. "If you indeed have business with J'mon Sa Ord, then the emperor will let you in. If you do not, you will be sent out. We have no business between either of those answers. If you wish to enter, do so, but keep your weapons sheathed, and keep an eye on that one."
Sam: The big one?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: He's well-behaved.
Matt: "I don't trust his face."
Taliesin: His face is usually not the trouble.
Liam: Is it the beard?
Matt: "Very well. Welcome to Ank'Harel. Be pleased."
All: Be pleased.
Matt: He turns around and walks away. His bow is much smaller than you were originally taught by Jarett. You get the sense that that's more of a formality and is on a smaller scale for more informal conversations. As he walks back, he lifts one hand and does a loop with it. As he does, (door thudding). The gates open ever so slightly, enough to bring through as broad-shouldered an individual as Grog, as well as the rest of you easily. You guys walk up and approach.
Laura: Is anybody looking at Trinket weird, or is it okay? He's with us.
Matt: Actually, no one seems to bat an eye at the large bear that's wandering inside.
Travis: But they give a shit about the goliath? That's fucked up.
Taliesin: One last question for our good friend at the gate.
Matt: Okay, as you walk past him.
Taliesin: One more thing, good sir. If you were going to find a place to sleep comfortably, quietly, and without incident for the evening in the city, is there a place that you would recommend to a friend?
Matt: "Well, best I can think, there are many fine establishments of rest where rooms can be rented throughout the entirety of the city. Depending on how much coin you have to give, I would say you could..." He thinks for a second as I look at my notes.
Taliesin: Where you would put a brother-in-law that you liked?
Liam: Medium to high.
Matt: "I would recommend within the Suncut Bazaar, you would find the Debt's Respite, the Shade, or the Corner Cove. All very fine establishments, and very well watched by the Hand."
Travis: The Hand?
Sam: Are you a member of the Hand?
Matt: "I am. Is this your first time in the city, then?"
Taliesin: It is absolutely, yes.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: What was the name of the district?
Laura: The Suncut Bazaar.
Marisha: Suncut Bazaar.
Matt: As he watches you guys enter, the gates closing behind you, you now see the incredible reveal of the interior of the mystical city itself. Streets of smooth cobblestone-like red pebbles lead your eyes to hundreds of visible, vertically-inclined buildings of reaching peaks and smooth, pointed rooftops as far as your eye can see across the cityscape. It's a city of vibrant color; you see nearly every home, storefront, and outhouse has some form of draping silks or painted mural to give it individual character, standing out against the rest of its neighboring abodes, creating a calming, beautiful symphony of really nothing, in the presentation of it all. The people are walking with purpose, and the sounds of foreign barking and shouts occasionally break the air. Welcome to Ank'Harel.
Taliesin: Let's get arrested right now!
Marisha: Fight!
Matt: What do you guys wish to do?
Sam: We need spice. We need to find out about this merchant guy.
Travis: Got to get laid.
Sam: We got to get laid. Every continent, right? That's our pact. (laughter)
Travis: There's nothing that doesn't mean it's a pact.
Taliesin: We're going to need to talk to some gentry. We're going to need to talk to a library.
Marisha: Well, we should probably start with a tavern.
Taliesin: And I should also mention, not just a tavern is available, but we do in fact have three titled people within our crowd, so we can actually talk to people of standing and note with very little difficulty.
Liam: Are we certain that that will hold any water on this continent?
Taliesin: It holds water on every continent. Only people who are not titled think it doesn't.
Sam: Should we split up into a couple parties? No? All right.
Taliesin: Let's find a tavern, find some rooms. Let's go to this bazaar.
Marisha: People tend to know things in taverns.
Taliesin: Get the word out of what we're looking for.
Sam: To the Suncut Bazaar!
Travis: Wait, what if there's a market, like an open farmer's market we could get some spice?
Laura: Yeah. As we look around, do we see any markets? Actually, the shopping district would be a wonderful place to look for--
Marisha: Is that in the Suncut Bazaar, or could we head that direction while we look?
Sam: Oi! Oi, you there, boy! (laughter)
Matt: As you glance over, you see walking down the street what appears to be two teenage boys, huddled together, wearing drab, ankle-length cloth robes. One of them has a purple shawl over their shoulders. The other has a hood up, and they're both carrying small satchels of fruit in their arms. They both stop and turn. They look curiously at the small gnome, the small, pale gnome in foreign clothes and adorned, beautiful armor that walks up to them in the street.
Sam: That looks like fine fruit. Where would you go to go shopping for things here, market-y things?
Matt: (muttered conversation) "You are a very small man."
Sam: I've heard that. It's a glandular condition. (laughter)
Matt: "I'm sorry to hear that."
Sam: Yes. My cross to bear. I've seen many medicine men about it, but they can't cure it, but many have recommended that I get a diet of vegetables and fruit. Where could I buy some, just like the kind that you have?
Matt: "This fruit is actually very difficult to find and come across. If you wish, you could purchase this batch."
Sam: Okay. I've seen this before. I'm not interested in buying from you. I just want a market or a bazaar or anything.
Matt: "Bazaar. You are looking for the Suncut Bazaar?"
Sam: Yeah, that!
Matt: "It is farther down that way. Look to the blue tower in the center of the city? Walk in its direction to the eastern skyline--"
Laura: I'm not looking in the direction. I'm keeping my eyes on them the entire time he's talking.
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Marisha: I'm desperately trying to commit every direction to memory.
Taliesin: I am so fearful that he's about to try and buy meth from children.
Laura: 20.
Matt: "Look for the strings of crimson flags that hang across the very street corners. That will signify the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar."
Sam: You're so helpful.
Matt: 20. They both seem confused, but also strangely enamored with this tiny man who's talking to them. No shifty behavior beyond that.
Travis: Their hands aren't moving into someone's pockets?
Laura: No.
Sam: Thank you so much, young men, for your help. Also, spice? (laughter)
Travis: Yes! Oh my god!
Taliesin: No!
Sam: Do you spice?
Marisha: Do you spice?!
Travis: Yo, you cool? You cool, dog?
Matt: (muttered conversation) "I don't know what you're talking about."
Sam: I'm not an authority. Do you spice? Spice it?
Matt: "I am sorry. I'm confused?"
Sam: It's cool. Ignore that part. Thank you so much. What do you think, a little spice?
Matt: He puts his hand out.
Sam: I flip him a coin.
Matt: He takes it. "Good luck finding your fruit."
Sam: Okay. Thank you.
Matt: And they both walk away, but at a slow pace, looking over their shoulder at you the whole way.
Sam: They seemed legit! They seemed like they were street kids.
Taliesin: What about that was legit?!
Sam: They're riffraff. They could know what spice is.
Taliesin: They were carrying fruit!
Sam: They look normal, but I've got a keen eye for these things. I was a kid on the street for a long time.
Liam: Sam? No joke, thanks for the ab workout. (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh god.
Travis: Fuck. That was great.
Taliesin: I can't.
Liam: (deep sigh)
Travis: Do we go in the direction?
Laura: We walk towards the Suncut Bazaar, keeping an eye out.
Matt: All right. As you guys continue deeper into the city, the sheer size of this town reminds you of a mirror universe form of Emon, in the way that the streets narrow and then open, and the liveliness of culture around you in its heyday, and it saddens you, because it reminds you of back when the city was at its prime, when you first arrived and made it a home for yourself. But at the same time, the energy is infectious, and you can't help but feel like there's a lot of interesting people, culture, and momentum all about you no matter where you seem to walk across these streets. Though the culture here appears to be far older than that of Emon that you've encountered; even the buildings and constructs range in ways that-- maybe not as old as Vasselheim, per se, but at least you can see that there's some variation to some of the abodes here that have been worn through time more so than any you have encountered in Tal'Dorei, for the most part. These decorated and intricate buildings fill the streets. You can see pride in their construction, and the smells of horses and hot desert air combine with various burning spice and sage that occasionally wafts through the air to your nostrils. The ever-changing exotic skyline occasionally grabs your attention. You see the distant shadow of what looks like a skyship docked at a sky port. You get looks of many citizens, expressions ranging from amusement to mistrust as you pass by, until you come upon a massive building that shines with the sunlight. Above you, you see a number of red flags that hang and drift, about five feet in length, these thin, draping pieces of silk that shift with the breeze, and you can see numbers of these strands across different roads, and it's at this point that you look up and realize that this is the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar. Looking off towards the left, and what you've been watching as you approach, there are this cluster of dark blue and purple towers of various widths marking a central place in the center of the city. In the center of them, there is one very large, cylindrical tower that rises up past them all into what looks like a chalice or a cup-like platform at the very top that is impossibly high amongst the rest of the structures here in the city. It seems to be a beacon or watchtower over the entirety of Ank'Harel. But your attention now, here in the Suncut Bazaar, as you step around the corner, you can see tents and storefronts and buildings and voices raised as different barkers are shouting out for their wares. You can see carts being drawn through the streets by horse and camel. You can see what appear to be dozens upon dozens of people coming through with small satchels and coming by and purchasing their necessities for the day. You can smell cooking meats and food in the distance. You can see street performers juggling, and distant music of buskers in the side of the street, playing various flutes and instruments: some you recognize, some you do not. You actually see a shawm. It catches your attention on the side of the street.
Sam: I need a new reed for that.
Matt: And here you are, amongst the Suncut Bazaar.
Travis: Can I whip around and see if anyone's following us?
Sam: Ooh, Dust of Tracelessness.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Hammer down! 14.
Matt: 14. No matter where you walk, eyes are on you.
Travis: I am a gorgeous man.
Matt: Most people you come around here, it seems a largely human population. Beyond that, you've not seen a single dwarf as you've walked through the city, but you have seen a number of dark-skinned halflings, a few half-elves. Not an elf has caught your eye since you've wandered through. You've seen a couple of tieflings that walk openly in this city, which is a rare thing from Emon. Even there, most tieflings generally are met with mistrust and prejudice in the street. Here, no one seems to pay mind or bother. You do see a few half-orcs, this team of half-orcs that are shouting out in a language that none of you understand. Some sort of sales pitch they're giving, and there's a few people gathered around them. This is a very wide variety of people that live in this city, and everyone seems to mesh together without issue or prejudice, but not one goliath has caught your eye, and you've caught the eyes of many. And wherever you walk, you can see the townspeople stop, and they don't gawk. They don't stare intently. They're more curious, but no one appears to be following you.
Laura: Are the shops here indoors, or are they outdoor tent markets?
Matt: There are a few that appear to go into buildings, but the majority of this, as you look at now the Suncut Bazaar itself, while it is a section of the city, it is mostly open sky and is probably hundreds of various tents, carts, pop-up stand-ups, and even the center of the street, blankets set out, with the various merchants there with their wares strewn across the ground, waiting for anybody to come and approach.
Laura: Do we see any spice merchants?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Liam: Also, while she's rolling, do we all see people eyeballing him?
Matt: Yeah. It's pretty easy to see, and most everyone's--
Travis: In love? Enamored? Jealous?
Laura: 11.
Matt: 11. You look around and ask a few people, and most everyone shrugs their shoulders or points you in an odd direction, and no immediate spice merchants catch your attention. You're still on the outskirts of the Suncut.
Marisha: Do there appear to be any fruit merchants?
Matt: There are a few, actually. Yeah. And it's interesting. In this very hot desert environment, and you understanding how most plant life exists, fruit should be pretty damn rare, and what fruit would make it here seems to be pretty dry and withered. But everything you come across here is very plump, beautiful, and fresh.
Taliesin: Life.
Marisha: Needs things to live.
Taliesin: Needs things to live.
Marisha: There's not many things, no. Can I go up to one of the fruit merchants?
Matt: You go up to what appears to be a woman, probably in her late thirties. Her hair is long past her shoulders, and these dark black, brunette waves that spray out like mermaid hair across her shoulders. As you approach, she eagerly reaches out. "You look like you are traveling here to Ank'Harel in search of beautiful, delicious fruits of which to whet your palate. Yes? Would you like for these fine apples, of which are the finest you could find?"
Marisha: Apples? Oh wow. I was looking for something a little bit more exotic. Something native to this land.
Matt: "Ah, well--" She takes the apples back. "What you'd prefer, then, would be the kurrak fruit." And she pulls out what looks like a mango, but the exterior of it is very rough, with these little spines all around it. "While it is difficult to hold, crack open for a delightful flavor. It is gentle. It is like a sweet water experience."
Marisha: That was very descriptive. Thank you.
Matt: "Of course."
Marisha: How much do I owe you for this?
Matt: "For this, that would be two silver pieces."
Marisha: Two silver. And how much, just for future reference, are the apples?
Matt: "The apples would go for one silver piece apiece."
Marisha: One silver apiece. That's pretty steep. Don't worry about it. Here you go. I give her a little extra.
Matt: "Thank you so much for your patronage. Anything else you would like?"
Marisha: I think I'm good, thank you.
Laura: I peek around her shoulder. Where would the Shade be?
Matt: "The Shade? The Shade would be-- it's hard to explain. Do you see that building over there with the dark green steeple?" And you glance off in the distance. You can see, layers back, there appears to be one spire, this very harsh point that has a dark green tint. "That is the roof of the Shade. That'd be what you're looking for."
Laura: Thank you so much.
Matt: "Not a problem."
Liam: I would like to walk by, and as I'm passing Vex, I'm going to do that thing where you walk past a friend and you do that sideways kick in the butt, and I'm going to go stand by Grog, and anybody I see giving him the evil eye, I'm going to match it back.
Matt: Okay. You watch as she walks away, she had her hands out to Vex, and as soon as Vex keeps walking away, she goes--
Marisha: I toss her a gold. She's with me.
Matt: "You are free to shop here any day you like."
Marisha: And what was your name?
Matt: She pulls the coin out and pops it away and says, "I am Shubad."
Marisha: Shubad?
Matt: "Shubad."
Marisha: Keyleth.
Matt: "A pleasure to meet you."
Marisha: A pleasure. Thank you so much.
Travis: Are any of the barkers talking about magic stuff?
Taliesin: I'm also looking for a soothsayer.
Liam: What do you want to see, a show?
Travis: Well, I don't know. It just seems so exotic.
Taliesin: Anything out of the ordinary and/or a soothsayer, card-reader, bones-reader, whatever they have that's like that.
Matt: Okay. Both of you make investigation checks as you look around and ask around.
Liam: And I don't like the way these folks are looking at big man, so I'm going to stay by him.
Matt: You stay close to Grog.
Laura: No going up from that. That's what it is.
Travis: Negative two. (laughter)
Sam: Is that true?
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: I am city-blind, apparently.
Laura: What are you looking for?
Taliesin: I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary, but specifically, a soothsayer, a card-reader, a bones-thrower.
Matt: Grog. Glancing about, you look to see something shine across the ground. As you rush up and find it, you find what looks to be a magically enchanted stone about that big. Rough around the edges, but the reddish color is brighter red than the rest of the stones on the ground, and you're sure that this may be exactly what you were looking for.
Liam: I'm watching him.
Travis: I quickly get on my hands and knees, and I start moving the sand around, looking for one just like it, just to make sure it's unique.
Matt: There are many red stones around it, as you press the bit of dust and sand gathered around the other cobblestones, but this one appears to be unique.
Travis: Oh! What does it taste like?
Matt: There's a hit of saltiness to the dust that has gathered in this vicinity.
Travis: I gave away my salt-lick rock!
Matt: You did. (laughter)
Liam: I take a moment to marvel at how a being of such ferocity and power can be such a doofus at the same time. It's amazing.
Sam: I'm going to plant myself at the end of two rows of the intersection and wait for people to walk by. And as they do, I say: Spice? Spice, spice, spice? You spice it? Spice, spice, spice?
Laura: Can I have seen Percy looking around?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Can I help him look?
Matt: Percival, what did you roll?
Taliesin: Where did it go? Investigation? I rolled a nine.
Matt: Yeah. It's funny. For all the preparation of being a noble and public speaking, you are utterly lost.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm terrible in urban areas. I've learned this. I get flustered.
Matt: The culture is so vastly different from what you're used to, and the people don't seem to really pay much mind to your relatively important outfit and presence, and you're lost at sea.
Taliesin: I've never rolled a decent investigation check. It has never happened.
Matt: Vex walks up to you.
Laura: What are you looking for, dear?
Taliesin: Beyond anything interesting. Everything is too interesting.
Laura: It's very colorful.
Taliesin: A soothsayer of some kind, perhaps. It might be a good way to start getting the word out of the sorts of things we're looking for.
Laura: What sorts of things?
Taliesin: We're looking for a cloak. We're looking for a merchant with one eye.
Travis: I found a rock!
Taliesin: And we're looking for rocks-- not anymore, I suppose. And those are usually the most trustworthy of the untrustworthy people you find in a city.
Laura: Investigation? 19.
Matt: 19. The two of you begin to meander around, look around. You see, after some wandering, what looks to be a single blanket set out with a small half-dome shade structure of various cotton cloths that have been layered and pinned to create this loose escape from the sunlight. And you see what appears to be an older man with a very long braided beard that goes past his belly-button. He sits there, sleeveless open shirt, baggy pants, no shoes, and before him a deck of cards that is laying in a stack, and he has his eyes closed with his hands resting at the ends of his knees.
Liam: It sounds like fun.
Laura: Want to walk up? Yeah?
Taliesin: You mind blowing a little bit of money on this?
Laura: No, actually.
Marisha: Are we all there?
Matt: Depends on if you guys want to follow.
Marisha: I'd like to follow.
Matt: Okay. as you guys are approaching, you over in the corner.
Sam: Spice it? Spice it? Fusaka!
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: A billion. Deception?
Matt: Deception, yeah.
Sam: 32.
Matt: This marks your ability to double-talk or subtly put out the vibes for an individual.
Liam: Why aren't you a crime kingpin?
Matt: Who knows what Scanlan's ultimate destiny is?
Taliesin: I have a song for your next playlist. I'm so excited.
Matt: After a few moments of you doing this and a few people walking away, looking frustrated and taken aback, partially by your visual form and the unexpected contents of your words, one man in his early twenties walking up, what looks to be a damp cloth wrapped loosely around the head to keep the head cooled under the sun's heat, walks up and leans in and goes, "You're asking about spice, yes?"
Sam: Yes, hard-to-find spice. I don't know if they have it in this particular bazaar. It takes a seller with a keen eye to identify it.
Matt: "Well, I know folks who are purveyors of many spices here. Please, what do you seek?"
Sam: It's not really something that I want to discuss out in the open, but we could take a walk and talk about it.
Matt: "Good, good. Lead on. We'll have a conversation as we go." As he stands back up after leaning down for you, you get a little glance at what appears to be a slightly pointed ear and what looks like a hint of a mustache that's grown through. Very similar in visual presentation as to your comrades: not full elf, not full human, though definitely a much darker shade due to the out-in-the-open lifestyle of Ank'Harel. You begin to walk with this figure through the street. We'll get to you in just a moment. So as you guys make your way to the older gentleman sitting on the ground, eyes closed.
Laura: We sit down in front of him.
Matt: His eyes are still closed.
Laura: Be pleased.
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Marisha: Be pleased.
Matt: "Be pleased." His eyes open, and you can see his eyes are snow-blind. They are clouded over with what would probably be terrible cataracts or something else that has caused him full blindness, but he stares past you as he opens his eyes. "So you wish to be read, then?"
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Yes.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "Five gold for my services."
Sam: (whispers) He won't know what you put in his hand!
Taliesin: You're not there.
Marisha: He will know. He's a fortune teller, for Christ's sake.
Liam: Five plumbing washers.
Laura: Should I put five or 15, for each of us?
Taliesin: Five, for the moment. He knows there's three of us.
Matt: He places it into a small side pouch. "What do you wish to be read for?" He takes the cards and begins shuffling.
Taliesin: We search for a garment. We search for a man.
Matt: His way of shuffling cards is interesting. As opposed to the usual like double shuffle, he picks up the deck in one hand and splits it and then shuffles it together. Turns it around, splits it, and then shuffles it together on each side. It's this weird boy with a crystal in Labyrinth, but with a card deck. It's wild. As he stays still, looking past all of you.
Taliesin: And we search for answers towards the future that we inevitably run to.
Matt: The shuffling stops, and he grabs the deck. "You search for a garment." And he takes two cards out and throws them across the center of the blanket for you guys. You guys step back and take a look. One of them appears to have a fire or a camp flame with smoke pouring up out of it, and the other one appears to have a storm, a torrent of water, and he goes, "This garment you seek. It looks to be in motion, moving. If you seek this garment here, may haste take you. Your second question." What were you saying in the second one?
Taliesin: We search for a man.
Laura: With one eye.
Taliesin: Well, I didn't say that far.
Marisha: A merchant warrior. Missing.
Taliesin: He doesn't need that. He's fine.
Matt: What did you say?
Taliesin: Oh, we search for a man.
Matt: Pulls up two more cards and throws them, and they land almost exactly in the same place as the other two cards that he tossed before. They scoot to a stop. One card appears to be mostly blank, except it carries some sort of a stylized symbol or letter that you don't recognize. And the other one appears to be a hand of cards stuffed within a pile of coin. "You seek this man, yet it is not a man you seek. To where the luck brings you, the answers lie." And he puts out his hand.
Taliesin: Five more. Five more.
Matt: "And the third question?"
Laura: Can I insight check him as he's reading the cards? See if his face twitches at all, if it looks like he's making shit up.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: 21?
Sam: Oh, the whispers! So many whispers. How are the Cowboys doing, Travis?
Travis: I stopped looking.
Sam: I can tell you how they're doing.
Liam: Sounds like a sad man right there.
Taliesin: Wait, let's consult the cards. That's the third question.
Travis: It's pre-season. Nobody playing right now.
Sam: Oh yeah, sure.
Taliesin: The cards say the Cowboys are not--
Sam: Hey, maybe you and me should go to a game sometime.
Travis: I would love to.
Laura: Okay. And the third question?
Taliesin: We move towards a conflict. What should we know? What should we be prepared for?
Matt: Pulls the two cards forward, throws them down, landing once again almost precisely on the same space as the last two tosses. They slide to a stop. One of them shows a chasm cracking in the earth, and the other appears to show a singular, sunken skull. "The path is to change historic, but many will fall as the transition is to take. Take your time wisely, for the hourglass runs quickly."
Laura: Goddamn it. Five more gold.
Matt: "Is this all of your questions?"
Taliesin: That will do, yes.
Matt: He bows his head ever so slowly towards you. "Then be pleased." And he takes the cards and shuffles them back into the deck, rights them into a perfect square with one quick move of his hand, and places them back in front, puts his hands back on his knees, and closes his eyes and puts his head down. There's a pause, and he reaches over and grabs a small, partially eaten apple and (chomp).
Laura: I as quietly as possible put another five gold in front of him.
Matt: His chewing stops, and he swallows. Reaches out, patting around it, and finds the gold coins. Puts it into a pocket. "You ask for one more question. What do you inquire?" (card shuffling)
Laura: Did I make the right choice?
Matt: Two cards land across the carpet before you. One of them shows upon it two hands joining, and the other one shows a symbol of a sun rising over a mountain range. He says, "You've made many choices, but the one you speak of brings unity and a new dawn."
Laura: Be pleased.
Matt: He nods. "Be pleased." Takes the cards up, shuffles them back into the deck, and sets it down. He goes back into his meditative trance.
Taliesin: I feel that was money well spent.
Marisha: I guess.
Laura: That was so cool!
Taliesin: Well, we know we do not necessarily look for a man, which is important. We know that time is even more of the essence than we first implied, and considering that almost every soothsayer I've ever met is as crooked as the day is long, the word is now out that we're looking for them.
Laura: Well, that's the Shade. Should we head that direction?
Taliesin: We should.
Laura: Grog?
Travis: Yeah?
Laura: Do you want to bring your rock?
Travis: My what?
Taliesin: We should grab Scanlan.
Liam: Where is he?
Matt: Scanlan is gone.
Liam: Well, shit.
Marisha: We need one of those leashes for him.
Liam: Shorthalt?
Taliesin: Let's maintain a certain level of plausible deniability.
Laura: Fuck.
Marisha: I come over the earrings. Scanlan? Just making sure you're okay, wondering where you are. No biggie. Just checking in.
Matt: As you're walking with your half-elvish friend down one of the nearby alleyways, you hear Keyleth speaking over the earring.
Sam: I say  I'm cool.
Taliesin: We're going to die. Let's get a room.
Travis: All right.
Matt: So you guys make your way towards the Shade?
Laura: Yes. Scanlan, we're heading towards the Shade. It's the big green tent. Follow?
Sam: (clicks tongue) Yeah.
Matt: Your half-elven compadre goes, "Are you all right?"
Sam: I'm cool. I'm cool on these desert nights, and I need something to warm me up at night, so that's why I was inquiring about this spice.
Matt: "Please, which spice are you seeking?"
Sam: It might not be entirely legal, but fusaka?
Matt: He nods. "It may take a bit of time. I know someone who could bring this, but I could not bring you to them. They'd have to bring it to you."
Sam: Where can we meet?
Matt: "Well, where are you staying?"
Sam: I'm staying outside of the walls in a small encampment, but I can meet him sometime tonight inside the walls.
Matt: "Where would you need to meet?"
Sam: How about where we first met, at that same intersection, or is that too busy?
Matt: "That is far too busy. It needs to be private, away."
Sam: I'm sort of a visitor here.
Matt: "If you want a place to stay, there is Luck's Run, the casino. There are back rooms there."
Sam: There's a casino?
Matt: "Yes."
Sam: Hells yes.
Matt: "There is the Debt's Respite Inn, which has its own grasp of lowlifes. Those are probably the best bets."
Sam: Let's meet in a room at the casino.
Matt: "The casino it is. Which room?"
Sam: The red room? I'm not familiar with this casino. I'll need some guidance.
Matt: "Wear a red shirt. He will find you in the casino."
Sam: Okay. That sounds good.
Matt: "All right. Hour past sundown, we'll find you there."
Sam: Tonight? What time?
Matt: "An hour past sundown."
Sam: Oh, sorry. I was thinking about the casino. Sorry.
Matt: "How much do you want?"
Sam: Oh my god. I'm not prepared for this!
Matt: He starts looking a little untrusting.
Travis: Be cool, man. Be cool.
Sam: Enough to get me through a week of heavy use. I want to go on a bender.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: A billion. More than before. 35.
Taliesin: How are you rolling that?
Matt: He gives you a look and bends down.
Sam: I've had a rough few weeks, and I need to get away from it all and go to that place--
Matt: He gets close to your face, interrupts you, and goes, "I mean this with all due respect: Being as small a man as you are, you have to be careful."
Sam: Don't tell me what to do. I can take it, all right? (laughter)
Sam: Let's just say that when I started using, I was your height. (laughter)
Matt: He backs off, hands up. He goes, "Very well. The amount you ask, I have no specific amount. I'd have to inquire, but I would say, to be safe, bring about 200 gold pieces with you. Just in case."
Sam: It'll be pure, not cut with anything else? I want the good stuff.
Matt: He looks at you, confused.
Sam: Am I buying cinnamon here?
Marisha: Might be.
Taliesin: It's going to be a living baby.
Sam: It's going to be a pound of turmeric!
Liam: Cardamom.
Sam: Yes. We have a deal. Let's shake on it.
Matt: He reaches out and takes your hand, and you shake. "Very well. Hour after sundown. Casino." He brings his cloth up and brings it up over his face for a second and darts into one of the nearby corners and vanishes.
Sam: Where did you guys go? Hello?
Laura: We're at the Shade!
Sam: Okay! I'm coming! Where is that? Shit, where am I? I ask around for the Shade.
Matt: You eventually find it.
Marisha: Scanlan, stop panicking. I can hear you hyperventilating.
Sam: I'm sorry, I've just never done anything that cool before!
Taliesin: And you still haven't.
Liam: The hell you haven't!
Sam: I just did a drug deal, guys!
Marisha: Scanlan, not over the speakers! Not over the phone line!
Laura: You have drugs with you?
Sam: No! I'll tell you later!
Taliesin: These earrings are tapped. You know that.
Sam: They could be listening! I'm coming to you!
Liam: Pike hears everything. (laughter)
Matt: You guys find your way to the Shade, and it's a large, circular sandstone wall that has a pointed tent roof above it held by a singular pole in the center. It is segmented into various rooms that have no ceiling, so everyone shares the same roof. This is what appears to be a lounge tavern, meaning there are drinks and wine served, but each room seems to have a carpeted and pillowed floor. Looks like there are beaded curtains and various draperies that separate each of the different rooms, and there's large, hookah-type tobacco pipes. It's very much just a relaxing lounge area.
Taliesin: There's hookah.
Marisha: There's hookah!
Taliesin: I've never tried hookah before.
Marisha: You've never tried hookah?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: The Earth Ashari are super into the hookah. It's really nice, yeah.
Taliesin: This is the only thing I actually know about this continent, is that there's tobacco.
Marisha: We should try it!
Laura: Did Scanlan get here yet?
Matt: Scanlan takes about five minutes or so, but eventually catches up to you guys.
Laura: Are we staying here? It's not very private.
Taliesin: It's not very private, and privacy is definitely higher on the list.
Laura: Can I find a patron that seems chill?
Matt: Yeah. You look around. You can see what looks to be a matronly older woman wearing some nicer dark purple and black clothing, who is sitting there with one big hookah next to her side, by herself, with a glass of wine to one of the sides, and is staring into space.
Taliesin: I can literally only see my mother when you describe this image, by the way. (laughter)
Taliesin: And only you and you know how funny that is, because it's sealed in there.
Laura: I walk up. Be pleased.
Matt: "Be pleased. Can I help you?"
Laura: Actually, just a small trifle. Are you staying here?
Matt: "Over the next few hours, yes."
Laura: Lovely. We're from out of town--
Matt: "You don't say."
Laura: Yes, and I've noticed the Shade is rather open. Do you know if the Corner Cove or Debt's Respite are quite as private as this, or do they have actual rooms?
Matt: "Both of those have rooms, yes."
Laura: Oh. Lovely.
Matt: "Do you have any other specifics or requirements?"
Laura: Are they far from here?
Matt: "Corner Cove is maybe two miles that way, but the Debt's Respite is about a mile that way."
Laura: Thank you. Sorry to bother you.
Taliesin: Should we put some cards on the table?
Laura: Some cards?
Marisha: I thought that's what we just did with that other guy.
Taliesin: We've been searching for a friend of ours, and it's been very complicated. She's got one eye. She's been around for quite a while.
Laura: She's a merchant in town. We've been looking for her.
Matt: "There are many merchants that live here."
Taliesin: Are there many merchants with one eye?
Laura: She's quite strong, actually.
Marisha: Some call her a warrior merchant.
Matt: "Warrior? If you're looking for warrior merchants, you're probably looking for the Scarbearers."
Taliesin: Yes, that sounds about right.
Laura: Yeah, she is a Scarbearer. Are they around here?
Matt: "Well, this definitely narrows down your search. The Debt's Respite is where you'll want to go. It's actually run by one of the heads of their ilk."
Marisha: Ilk?
Taliesin: Not an animal.
Matt: "Scarbearers. They're a bit of a rough-and-tumble lot."
Laura: Oh, are they?
Matt: "They hunt for coin, sell what else they find. Odd jobs. Some of them maybe not the most up and legal, but they work with a guarantee, and the head of their troop I think runs, or at least partially owns, the Debt's Respite."
Taliesin: Thank you. What are you smoking at the moment, by the way?
Marisha: I was just about to ask her the same thing!
Matt: "This? I don't know." Raises her hand, and one of the various workers there approaches with another bottle of wine. "Yes, may I help?" "What is this you put in here?" Blows it in her face. "That would be a Dusk Blossom Sage." Walks away. "Dusk Blossom Sage."
Taliesin: It's very fragrant.
Matt: "Pungent would be the world you're looking for."
Liam: I walk over to Keyleth and say  I've done this, but I don't think I knew what I was doing. Your people do this?
Marisha: Well, the Earth Ashari do, and the Fire Ashari sometimes.
Liam: You've done this.
Marisha: Yeah. I stayed with the Earth Ashari for a few months. You want to try? It's fun. It's very nice. It relaxes you. Oh, come on guys! We've got time!
Laura: Do we?
Marisha: We never take time for ourselves. Come on!
Laura: We've got a ticking time bomb!
Marisha: Just 15 minutes!
Taliesin: The cards said our luck. Perhaps this is a good way to ignite it.
Marisha: 15 minutes. Please, Vex, pretty please!
Taliesin: We are still waiting for Scanlan to get here, and then we'll take him to the next stop.
Matt: Scanlan, by the way, is right behind you.
Sam: Hi!
Marisha: Scanlan!
Sam: Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on you.
Liam: Now we really need to do it.
Laura: We do need to talk to him, actually. Do you mind if we join you? I motion to the waitress. Could we have some more Dusk Sage?
Travis: Something stronger.
Matt: You see her eyes roll. "I mean no offense, but this is my 'me' time."
Laura: Oh, of course!
Marisha: Let's get our own! We'll get our own little booth.
Taliesin: I'm going to put a gold coin on her tray. So you can keep smoking, and thank you for the time spent in our company.
Matt: She takes the coin, flicks it back to you and goes, "I appreciate, but do not require your patronage."
Taliesin: I'm grateful for your time.
Sam: Yeah. I like her.
Taliesin: Thanks, mom. It is burned into my head.
Travis: Getting our own?
Laura: Yeah, we go get our own.
Matt: You guys are brought into one of the small sections of the Shade. You are given your choice of various tobaccos. While it's not a large room, per se, you can all comfortably lounge in there. It's a nice place to get away. You can hear the distant sounds of the city, but for the most part, there's a soft violin music that plays towards the center of the area, so at least it has a nice atmosphere to it.
Travis: As we're in there, do we notice anyone with any large scars walking around?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: This'll go great. 12.
Matt: You see people with small, large scars. People with scars all over. Life out here can be a little tough at times, but no more scarred than most of the people you've encountered in your lifetime. And definitely nowhere near as scarred as the people you've run with for half of your lifetime.
Travis: There are no really large, scarred people in here.
Laura: Good to know. Thank you, Grog.
Taliesin: Good to know.
Laura: Good to know.
Liam: Hey, can I see that ruby you found before?
Travis: I have no ruby.
Liam: You'd hold out on me?
Travis: Nope. There was no ruby.
Liam: Why are you lying to me, Grog?
Travis: Look, Little Teeny is my friend. All right? He spoke to me out of the deserts of fate, and he is mine and mine alone.
Liam: All right.
Laura: Scanlan.
Sam: Oi.
Laura: Spice dealer?
Marisha: Yes, I want to hear this story.
Sam: I made contact. I'm supposed to meet up tonight in the casino one hour after sunset. I'm supposed to wear red. I will not lie, I am shitting myself, I'm so nervous.
Laura: Are you going to wear red?
Sam: Well, how else will they discern who I am? I don't want to go alone.
Laura: Well, I'll go with you.
Sam: Are you cool?
Laura: Of course I'm cool. I'm so cool, darling.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm cool!
Marisha: Me, too!
Sam: Well...
Taliesin: No, what do you mean? We're cool.
Sam: I don't want to draw too much attention, but I want to be safe.
Travis: (loudly) Are you buying drugs? (laughter)
Taliesin: Could not be happier.
Liam: What an episode! What an episode.
Taliesin: There's so many valuable lessons that can be learned at any moment.
Laura: Do you think maybe the reason Jarett was almost arrested was because of this fucking spice?
Taliesin: I think that's precisely what happened.
Laura: What the hell was he thinking?
Sam: But we're going to do it smarter. We're going to do it better.
Taliesin: No, we're not! (laughs) He's legitimately smarter than us.
Sam: I can do this. I am the one who cocks. (laughter)
Sam: I can do this. But I need some backup. Maybe Vax could come and he could wear red. And he could be the guy who--
Laura: Aren't they going to be looking for a very little man?
Sam: Okay, I'll wear the red, but maybe you could be there.
Liam: I will go with you, and I will hang back, and I will be there to stab out the eyes of anyone who wants to hurt you, but you are the talker, man. You've always been the talker.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Why does Scanlan never think I'm very cool? Why does he think that?
Sam: No, I think you're great.
Laura: You never want me to go with you, I could've helped you find Kaylie, and you didn't ask me to.
Liam: Well, let's be real. She's the coolest one in the group, really.
Sam: The big pointy hat, it's really dorky.
Laura: You're the one who fucking makes me wear this thing!
Sam: I know!
Liam: Can she take it off at the casino, though?
Laura: I'm not flying. I can take it off whenever I fucking want!
Travis: Can we all come? It sounds super dangerous. I just want to watch. I'll be so sly.
Taliesin: We are, by the way, walking to our next destination.
Marisha: No, I am enjoying my hookah.
Taliesin: Oh, I forgot we got hookah. Oh my god.
Laura: We're sitting and hookah-ing through this whole fucking thing.
Liam: I did it before, but I don't think I really did it.
Marisha: Is this a split hose? We have a split hose.
Sam: No, thanks. I'm straight-edge tonight. I've got to think clearly.
Marisha: It's just tobacco, Scanlan.
Taliesin: Is it just tobacco? We really don't actually know.
Marisha: Actually, that's a good point. I do a few test puffs. Is it just tobacco? Is there something special about this hookah?
Matt: It seems to be just delightfully flavored tobacco.
Marisha: It's nice! So okay, you don't want to inhale all at once. It's more like flavor thing. Like a cigar.
Liam: Yeah. I copy Keyleth. (coughs)
Marisha: Vax. Come on.
Laura: Good job, brother. Good job.
Travis: What happened to you?
Liam: I just, (coughs, sniffs) I can't stop (coughs) coughing. (coughs) I'm fine.
Marisha: Wow. This is cute, actually. This is adorable. I hand him some water from my pouch. Just a little dry.
Liam: (coughs) It's really good.
Laura: Wow, you've never looked cooler in your entire life.
Liam: I agree with you.
Travis: Is there a bar in this place? A proper bar?
Matt: Not really a bar. It seems the servants take orders and bring you your various liquid imbibements.
Travis: Right. Can I flag down a--
Matt: Yeah. You see a man walks up to you, long dark curly hair, bit of a goatee growing. "How can I help you?"
Travis: Yeah, I'm royalty from a far-off land. I pride myself on trying the fiercest spirit in the area that I'm visiting. What do you guys pride yourself on?
Matt: "You want the Sandkheg's Hide."
Travis: The sandcake side?
Matt: "The Sandkheg's Hide."
Travis: Oh, hide. Oh, is it a food or a drink?
Matt: "It's a drink."
Travis: Yeah, then one of those'd be great.
Matt: "It's expensive."
Travis: Yeah, well, don't tell anybody but I'm super fucking rich. Only because I have to check with my national treasury, how much is it?
Matt: "Ah, do you wish to have a glass or a bottle?"
Travis: A bottle.
Matt: "A bottle will run you 350 gold pieces."
Sam: Oh!
Travis: I'll take two.
Matt: Walks off.
Taliesin: How have we not stopped this?!
Matt: Comes back with two very full-- (laughs)
Laura: That's from your personal fucking funds!
Travis: We be clubbing, motherfuckers.
Laura: That ain't no party funds.
Taliesin: Those are gold coins. You're not making it rain, you're making it hail, for god's sakes.
Marisha: Does that get to come with us, or is it bottle service? Because if this is bottle service, we're here for the night.
Travis: Okay, maybe there's champagne though, yes?
Matt: He comes back a little later with these two dark green glass wine bottles that have this heavy leather wrapped around them and bolted together at certain places. It looks like leather at times, but as you get closer, you feel it's actually hard. It's almost like a chitinous armor on the outside of the glass.
Travis: This was meant for me.
Matt: Both of these vials are given to you with heavy corks that are wax-coated over the top. "Here you are."
Travis: Oh! May I start a tab? No? Fine. Then I give, shit. (mutters) How much do I owe?
Laura: 700. TRAVIS 700. Here's 800 gold.
Sam: Oh my god.
Matt: "Thank you very much, and please, do let me know if you require anything else."
Travis: No problems.
Matt: And he exits the room.
Taliesin: I have never hated you so much before, in my entire life.
Travis: Prepare to drink like kings.
Liam: I feel the opposite way. I'm very proud.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah. Grog, I think this bottle's more well-armored than we are.
Travis: Yeah, it's like amazing animal-skin Maker's Mark. So how do we crack this bitch open?
Sam: Guys, I need you to be clear-headed tonight!
Taliesin: I'm having a glass of this. We've just paid a fortune for it.
Laura: We're saving a bottle.
Taliesin: We are saving a bottle.
Travis: Right. Are there any opening utensils around, because I don't want to unsheathe--
Taliesin: May I sword it?
Matt: You may.
Taliesin: I'm going to sword it.
Laura: But don't take your sword out, because we're not allowed to bring our weapons out.
Taliesin: Oh, there's no weapon in here?
Matt: You're currently private in the room.
Taliesin: Oh, we're private in the room.
Marisha: I thought this was an open tent-commune thing.
Matt: It's an open ceiling, but there are rooms segmented by cloth and what looks like sandstone walls, so there are little pockets and alcoves, and you guys currently have one that you're in right now.
Taliesin: It's not no weapons, it's just no usage of them.
Liam: Let's keep them sheathed, he said at the gate. But we are pretty hidden.
Taliesin: I'll just pop it.
Matt: Comes off, and the cork flies and bounces off one of the nearby walls. The smell that comes to you is extremely strong. It resembles a very vinegar turned wine mixed with this, for lack of a better term, a very earthy scent. It's almost herbal, medicinal. It's not at all what you would have expected for something so expensive.
Travis: Who wants to be first? Keyleth?
Marisha: Fill me up. Oh wait, you want me to go first?
Laura: I want a shot.
Travis: You want a shot?
Sam: Percival just took some.
Matt: As it touches your tongue, that smell transitions into a very acidic taste. It actually burns your tongue, and it goes numb within a matter of seconds. It is not a delightful flavor, and as the tongue goes numb, the back of the throat goes numb as you swallow. As the numbness continues down the rest of the body, the flavor has not improved at all, but it brings this universal numbness. And as the slight pain of the burn subsides, you, with just but a few sips, become extremely intoxicated, but also just numb.
Liam: How is it?
Marisha: How is it?
Taliesin: (slurring) Not very good.
Laura: Oh shit.
Taliesin: (slurring) But if--
Laura: Oh, he's fucking wasted.
Marisha: I slap him.
Taliesin: (slurring) You should do that again. That felt really good. I'll do it.
Laura: Oh shit.
Sam: Liquid MDMA.
Marisha: I take a sip.
Laura: I'm not drinking mine. Here, Grog.
Marisha: I want to know! I take a sip.
Matt: You take a sip, and the same sensation takes, and the numbness sets in, this slight vibration at the back of the skull. Elements of this remind you of being very drunk, with but a few sips.
Liam: Hey, can you hear me? Yeah? You all right?
Marisha: (slurring) Oh holy shit.
Marisha: (slurring) This is so weird.
Taliesin: (slurring) This is so weird.
Marisha: (laughs)
Taliesin: (slurring) We're good.
Liam: I take them by the cheeks. Can you feel this?
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Yeah!
Liam: You can?
Marisha: (affirmative grunt)
Liam: Can you feel this?
Taliesin: (affirmative grunt)
Marisha: (affirmative grunt)
Travis: Does it taste good?
Taliesin: (dissenting grunt)
Marisha: (dissenting grunt)
Liam: Do you recommend it?
Taliesin: (non-committal grunt) (laughter)
Marisha: (non-committal grunt) (laughter)
Travis: (high-pitched) It hurts man, oh my god!
Laura: Are you going to try it, Grog? (laughter)
Liam: I am not going to have a sip of that right now. Definitely sometime, but--
Laura: Back in the mansion, maybe.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: But not when we have to do something tonight.
Taliesin: (slurring) What do we have to do?
Laura: As charming as you two are right now.
Travis: I'm going to stopper it and then I'm going to put the extra bottle in the Bag of Holding.
Sam: You didn't have any?
Travis: Nope.
Liam: Just these two?
Travis: (laughing) Money well spent!
Laura: Can I step out and find that waiter that we paid for?
Liam: Yeah, you're both really cute right now, but you're useless.
Marisha: I lean on Vax a little bit.
Laura: Wonderful beverages you just served us. How long does that last?
Matt: "Depends on how much you're drinking."
Laura: Just a tiny bit.
Matt: "Hour, maybe."
Laura: Fabulous. They came with quite a price tag, didn't they?
Matt: "'It's very dangerous to harvest and create, yes."
Laura: I could assume. What exactly is in?
Liam: Yes, what are they harvested from?
Matt: He thinks a minute, then goes, "I don't know which part of the sandkheg it is, but it is taken from the usually venomous bile or spittle of the creature."
Taliesin: (slurring) That's really good bile!
Travis: It's a living thing.
Laura: I'm assuming, I mean, back in the city that we're from--
Matt: "Mind you, it is refined and pickled by the finest of various-- It is a delicacy across Ank'Harel and northern areas of Marquet. I was merely fulfilling the request of your companion."
Taliesin: (slurring) No, it's very good.
Laura: Thank you so much. Where we're from, usually when purchasing such a great and expensive item, room service is included. I'm assuming we have somewhere to stay for the night?
Taliesin: (slurring) I don't think that it's that kind of place.
Matt: "I mean, you are welcome to stay, should you pay an evening price, yes, but that is not part of the price of the drink of which you have purchased, no."
Laura: Oh. Cultural differences! Good to know.
Taliesin: (slurring) We have to move.
Liam: Hey. Can you say your full name right now?
Taliesin: (slurred) Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo the third of Whitestone.
Sam: Don't say the W word!
Taliesin: (slurring) Whitestone?
Sam: Okay, it's fine now.
Taliesin: (slurring) What? (shushing)
Travis: How long until you have to meet this guy at the casino?
Taliesin: (slurring) Why're you talking? Just (shushes).
Sam: What time is it? Has the sun gone down?
Matt: No, you guys woke up maybe two and a half hours ago.
Taliesin: Day drinking! Yes!
Matt: You're maybe getting close to noon. The sun, last you saw before you got here, was close to the center of the sky.
Travis: Well, we've got time to kill, right?
Laura: We need to go find the Debt's Respite and maybe get a room.
Sam: Is that where we're going to sleep tonight?
Laura: That's where the Scarbearers are. We can get a room here.
Liam: And your deal is this evening, yes?
Sam: Yeah, we've got some time for that.
Travis: So we take off for the Debt's Respite.
Matt: Okay. Who's leading the charge for that?
Travis: No, you're not. I will.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation check, if you don't mind.
Sam: Investigation. You're terrible at those.
Marisha: (laughing) This is everything I wanted.
Taliesin: I'm so happy right now.
Laura: 26.
Matt: 26 investigation check. Within ten minutes you've asked the right questions between a number of various street urchins and street salespersons, to be directed straight towards the Debt's Respite.
Sam: I wrote it down correctly, Matt.
Matt: In following the direction, you end up walking up to what looks like a rather rundown-looking establishment. The broken glass windows and missing front door lead you to think that perhaps it's been abandoned for months. Looks a little rough and ramshackle.
Laura: But they said this was being guarded by the Hand of Ord. Interesting.
Sam: My contact in the underworld said that this was a place that is a known hangout for seedy types. Right? Am I remembering that correctly?
Laura: No, the guard at the front of the city told us this was one of the places that you could stay, and it was guarded.
Matt: He said it was a place you could stay, because you were asking for taverns and inns.
Liam: We have accounts from two different people, and they're two different opinions.
Taliesin: It's like Yelp. But better. I'm going to knock. (knocking)
Matt: As you approach the front door, it's partially ajar and as you push it open, you can see the inside is a whole different story. As your eyes adjust to the interior you find actually a bustling business of barhands slinging tankards across seven stained wood tables, some of the folk look rather day-drunk, similar to these individuals, though it has worn a bit off since the original sip. And most look to be various miscreants or post-work farmers taking a break. The interior is familiar and probably closer to the taverns you're used to in more of the poorer districts of Emon and surrounding cities than some of the more luxurious areas you've recently found yourselves in. Vax, Vex, and Keyleth-- actually, Keyleth, make a perception check with disadvantage.
Marisha: Aw. I see why you're doing that. With disadvantage?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: 17.
Matt: Okay. Vex and Vax, as you guys walk into the room, you do catch off in the distance behind a series of barrels that are stacked and the edge of a shelf that contains rows and rows of glasses, tankards, plates, and various things. You just barely make out what looks to be an androgynous figure, face masked with dark blue and black cloth, with a hint of leather armor, hiding in the corner. Like barely visible to you and you can make out the details due to your very keen ability to gather your surroundings quickly.
Liam: Is the armor similar to that suit of armor we saw on the other guy?
Matt: Nope. This is very muddled, low leather armor.
Laura: Are they wearing a cloak?
Matt: Can't tell; their back's hidden, and they're quiet.
Laura: So they don't have something up? Do they have a hood over their head?
Matt: They have a hood and a mask. Looks to be like a cloth mask wrapped around him.
Liam: I'm going to hang by the two sobering-up twins over here and keep an eye on that person.
Matt: You guys also watch throughout all the various patrons and people that are wandering about this establishment, one figure stands out amongst the others. You see a bronze-scaled dragonborn: bulky and thick, muscular armored in light hides and bracers. He clutches an untouched mug that is brimming with an amber-colored ale and is lost in thought, staring off towards one of the broken windows that leads outside. Very heavy, muscular arms. Maybe not quite the height of Grog, but definitely a similar build.
Laura: Tail or no tail?
Matt: Sitting down, you can't tell.
Liam: You don't know.
Matt: What do you guys do?
Taliesin: (slurring) We're fine.
Laura: Wow. I guess I walk up to the tavernkeep.
Matt: There is no tavernkeep. There are barmaids walking around and passing drinks, but there is no barkeep right now.
Laura: I grab one of the barmaids. Who do we speak to about a room?
Matt: "You would speak to Treev," and points to the dragonborn, who is currently staring out of the window.
Laura: Oh. Well, there we go. I walk over.
Travis: I go with her.
Matt: He's spacing out. As soon as you approach he goes, (groans) "What do you want, bothering a fellow in mid-fantasy?"
Laura: Sorry, sir.
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Laura: We're interested in a room for the night, actually.
Matt: "All right, well, what's your name?"
Laura: Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "Vex'ahlia. Treev. Treev Bonebreaker." And grabs your arm. As opposed to a handshake, like a full-on forearm, meaty grasp. Treev. T-R-E-E-V. "Treev Bonebreaker. Current caretaker of this fine establishment. Looking for rooms? I've got three available."
Laura: Wonderful. Mind if I sit down?
Matt: "At this rate, sure. I doubt I'm going to find myself back to that dream. Anyway, what do you and your rather scrawny-looking friend there have to say?"
Travis: I look around.
Laura: We're actually here on a rather important mission from Emon.
Matt: "Never been there."
Laura: It was quite a beautiful city. Not as much anymore.
Matt: "Well, that's unfortunate. Sometimes cities fall to the lowest despots. It happens."
Laura: Yes, it does.
Matt: "Rooms?"
Laura: Yes. Three, you said?
Matt: "Three rooms available."
Laura: And how much would those rooms be?
Matt: "How many are staying?"
Sam: Six.
Laura: Six of us?
Matt: "And your bear?"
Laura: Well, yes, but he doesn't take up much space.
Matt: "Well we have to put a bear tax on this, you realize."
Laura: "A bear tax?"
Matt: "Yes. I haven't had a bear here before. Who knows what damage it can do? Consider it protection."
Laura: You know what? He can sleep outside, don't worry. Don't worry about the bear.
Matt: "All right. I take no responsibility what happens to your bear outside."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: "That'll run you ten gold per room. 30 gold for the night."
Laura: (whispers) Ten gold? (louder) Are these really fancy rooms, then?
Matt: "No. God no. I don't know where you're from in Emon or what the prices are there, but here, it's expensive."
Laura: Every fucking thing is expensive here.
Taliesin: Can I attempt to start looking around the room to try and find anything interesting and try and be useful?
Matt: Make an investigation check with disadvantage.
Laura: Can I insight and see if he's just taking fucking advantage of us because we're tourists? I don't want to roll that one. I want to roll this one.
Taliesin: Investigation? 12.
Laura: Natural 20!
Marisha: Oh shit.
Matt: Yeah, he straight-up jacked the price up. He can see the foreigner on your face.
Laura: You know what? We probably don't need the three rooms. They offered us some over at The Shade. It's fine.
Matt: "Certainly. Whatever your business may be. Is that all you need?"
Laura: Are you from Tal'Dorei?
Matt: "Me? No. Not originally."
Laura: No.
Matt: "Why?"
Laura: So you haven't heard of Draconia? Can I see from here if he has a tail or not?
Matt: There is no tail behind him.
Laura: Have you heard?
Matt: "Of Draconia? Unfortunately."
Laura: Have you heard what happened?
Matt: "No."
Laura: Draconia has fallen.
Matt: Grabs his drink that he's holding up, slams it on the table. It spills over. "You fucking with me?"
Laura: No.
Matt: "Well, there's a reason for celebration." And just chugs the entire drink in one go, you can see his dragonborn gullet just accepting the entire drink in one gulp. (sighs)
Laura: Well, I'd be happy to tell you more detail for a reasonable price on the rooms.
Matt: (laughs) "Sit down. All of you. 15 gold for the lot. All the meaty details. Sure."
Laura: So we tell him.
Matt: You tell him about everything, and he listens in. He starts enjoying it, and eventually falls a bit, sinking in the stake of things, and eventually that celebration falls to acceptance.
Taliesin: Does anyone mind if I fill him in on the future of Draconia?
Sam: If you do it in a slurry speech, sure.
Taliesin: It's going to be slightly slurry, but at this point at least I'm English again. We have the next several weeks we were going to attempt to free the populace from their new lord and master. But in order to do that we are here on a mission. We're searching for something. We're searching for a one-eyed merchant warrior, and a cloak.
Matt: "Well look, if you're looking to hire, you've got to explain the task then. We do have a code. Fuck what the rumors say."
Taliesin: I've never found anyone who doesn't have a code who lived very long to tell about it.
Matt: "Aye. Long enough. What's the point in living without one? That's how you end up shivved in the stomach and left to bleed in the street. What you looking to hire for?"
Taliesin: We are looking for the one-eyed merchant warrior who wears the coat of Cabal's Ruin.
Matt: "I know who you're seeking, aye. Mistress Asharru."
Taliesin: Mistress Asharru?
Marisha: We have a name! Goddamn it.
Matt: "She's one of our finest, and expensive because of it. But friend, she's been off for a week since her last job, so mayhaps her schedule is open. Would have to inquire. Write me a summary of your job you have for her. I'll have it delivered. Her answer may take a week or so."
Taliesin: We do not have, sadly, a week or so. The dragon falls in two weeks.
Matt: "Well, write her a letter, she'll receive it, and she'll return to you when she sees it fit. Our business is our business. If you don't like it, shove off, find someone else."
Taliesin: Sadly no one else will do. Not that I want to inquire of the sort of business she's in, because that's inappropriate, but is she in the town at least? If we were to write her, could we get word to her quickly?
Matt: "Why, I can get word to her immediately, but it's up to her when she wants to respond."
Taliesin: Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
Matt: He starts giving you a curious look and goes, "You come in here asking to hire one of my finest and don't know what work she does?"
Taliesin: I know what work she does.
Matt: "What work do you need her for?"
Taliesin: We need to save the world.
Matt: "And you need her help to save the world."
Taliesin: Sadly, but true. We at the very least need her blessing.
Laura: While he's talking, can I keep an eye on the figure in the corner?
Matt: Yeah. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: There are things that have been released upon this earth that will burn everything. And they will make their way here. Draconia is gone. Tal'Dorei is gone. All swaths of civilization have been wiped off the earth.
Matt: "We've weathered beasts. We've weathered dragons here in Emon."
Taliesin: Not like we've seen.
Matt: "So be it. But nevertheless, you want to hire her, you've got to write her a proposal." And he slides across a piece of parchment with a small quill about it. "I'll deliver it, and she'll get back to you when she sees fit."
Sam: Does she have a normal price?
Matt: "Depends on the job you're asking. She'll set her price."
Sam: Okay.
Laura: 30 perception.
Matt: 30 perception? The figure is watching all of you intensely but has not moved an inch. All you've seen are the eyes move, but they've been trained on your entire group since you arrived.
Liam: I've been watching.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Could I ask, (coughs) other than gambling, what sort of entertainment can you find in this city?
Matt: "All sorts of entertainment. There's various singers, musicians, dancers, performers. If you're looking for company there's all sorts of entertainment in that regard, of all the spectrums. If you're looking for games, probably a few months out before we get to any sort of the gladiatorial events."
Travis: I'm sorry, could you just, a bit more on--
Matt: "That's months away."
Liam: There's no place for our friend to get into a scrap?
Matt: "Well, you could certainly find a scrap, but none that are sanctioned by the Hand, and they'll put you away."
Liam: Sorry, big man.
Matt: "Lest you have someone to duel you. That's a whole different business."
Travis: What? Duel?
Matt: "That's sanctioned by the law."
Travis: A duel? A one-on-one duel?
Matt: "If you challenge one to a duel and they accept, aye."
Travis: In this city, it's legal? Anytime? High noon, midnight, when?
Matt: "You just have to sanction it by the Hand. You have to make sure that you both agree to fight to the death, and the fight has to happen in the Bowl of Judgment."
Travis: The Bowl of Judgment?
Sam: The Bowl of Judgment?
Matt: "Sits about the Sandherald district outside of the Cerulean Palace."
Travis: Wait, is that that super fucking tall thing we saw?
Matt: "That's the Cerulean Palace. It's quite close to it, aye."
Laura: Are any items allowed in the bowl, or do you have to go in bare-handed?
Matt: "It depends on the sanctions of the Ord and the agreement you come to, but fisticuffs are great for the gladiatorial events, but if you're fighting to the death, sometimes it's nice to bring a blade in."
Marisha: So what type of people like to participate in these duels?
Matt: "The kind that got nothing to lose. The kind that got a point worth proving with their life. Those kind. Doesn't happen often. When it does happen, it's a spectacle."
Taliesin: Is there like a lighter fight that can be found?
Sam: Arm wrestling match.
Taliesin: Arm wrestling or-- I don't know, what would be worse less than--
Laura: UFC.
Marisha: Less than a Bowl of Judgment?
Sam: Cup of Truth? (laughter)
Taliesin: A Wok of Truth, maybe.
Marisha: Bowl of Wheaties.
Liam: Tablespoon of Wrath. (laughter)
Taliesin: This is really uncomfortable.
Matt: "A few months until the games begin, but until then, that's about the only way you'll find bloodshed here. At least that won't lend you up in prison."
Travis: All right.
Sam: Good to know.
Laura: Good to know.
Taliesin: I'm sitting and I'm starting to compose a letter.
Laura: How's his handwriting?
Taliesin: Flouncy.
Matt: You're starting to gain it back. What do you write?
Taliesin: I'm going to show everybody before I hand it in. I'm going to write the truth, top to bottom, of the world is peril, we are facing a battle, and she holds or knows of an item that would turn the tide, and I wish to know its price or know its rental.
Marisha: Wow.
Sam: What are you asking her?
Marisha: I feel like that's not going to work.
Taliesin: I'm holding it. Before I hand it in I'm going to show. I don't feel that there is any deceit-- there is nothing I can think to say beyond the truth. We are either dealing with honest people, or we are not.
Marisha: I have a feeling that... yeah.
Laura: What if we just--
Taliesin: I'm also putting my rank and title and letting them know that I'm willing to--
Sam: Give away Vex's title?
Taliesin: I'm willing to give away Vex. Vex is entirely up for sale. No.
Travis: You're planning to recruit this person?
Taliesin: I'm not looking to recruit this person. I'm looking to rent or buy an object that she owns, or perhaps even trade, and we'll put 400 gold.
Marisha: Just to meet with her?
Laura: Just to meet with her.
Taliesin: As an offer of a meeting.
Liam: That's not bad.
Marisha: That's not bad.
Matt: He takes it. He packages in in a small container, a leather container.
Marisha: Did you put in there that it had to be prompt? That it had to be prompt?
Taliesin: And that time is of the essence.
Matt: "Oh, don't worry." (whistles) Whistles through his fingers and the figure in the wall that you'd been watching steps forward and slowly walks towards the table. Holds up the scroll, and the figure leans in. Covers his mouth and he whispers into the ear of the figure. The figure takes the scroll, gives a nod to all of you, and walks out of the tavern. "He'll deliver that to her promptly, now be on your way. 15 gold."
Laura: Oh yes, of course! Thank you for the rooms.
Matt: Takes a keyring out and starts fudging through the keys, pulls a few off and tosses them to you across the table. "All right, you've got it for a night."
Liam: I heard Grog. I'm going to follow out the door, go stealth.
Matt: Okay. You vanish out the door. Make a perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22. Okay. As you glance out the door and pull outside-- you're going stealth as well, you said? Roll stealth.
Liam: That is 25.
Matt: 25. Okay. You turn around the corner just as you see a flash of dark cloth around the edge of the Debt's Respite. You rush off to the edge and look around the corner way and down the alley. You can see the figure, full on, arms out to the side rushed behind, going into a very fast run, down the shaded hallway.
Liam: Shaded hallway?
Matt: The alleyway.
Liam: I'll follow.
Matt: Okay, so you continue to follow.
Liam: At a distance.
Matt: All right. Following the masked figure, you continue to give chance. It darts erratically, zig-zagging between areas. You can see this is a very trained pattern to lose anybody following them, but you're also trained in following those that wish not to be followed. Make another perception check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: You come around one corner, and you can see there's a wall that ends there, and you see just a little slip of material pass. And as you glance over, you can see the figure has jumped down onto a lower walkway onto what appears to be a recessed sector of this part of Ank'Harel, and has already darted beneath a nearby bridge and overpass that walks across to another series of buildings. You leap over, keeping in the shadow, and give chase down that way. You turn around underneath the bridge and you can see underneath the bridge, there is an archway that leads into a dark path down an actual hallway beneath the series of buildings you just saw ahead of you. Make another perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22. You look down the hallway, and you see the shadow of the figure framed against what looks to be another opening on the opposite side but the sunlight is coming through. You can just see the dark outline as it darts forward and then leaps off again, down the right past that exit. You follow, and you look off the side just as you see the figure slink behind one large crate next to a storage section outside of a warehouse. It ducks behind another one. Darts up to a building that looks to be shuttered and closed. It looks like a furniture store with a little sign at the top that says, "A Kingly Home." It moves an empty rain barrel to the side and slips the leather case through a hole that was previously hidden by the barrel, dropping it inside the building, slides the barrel over it again. Looks back and forth. Make another stealth check.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. Doesn't seem to make notice, and then darts off, leaping, leaping up onto a rooftop and vanishing off.
Liam: You said, "A Kingly Home"?
Matt: A Kingly Home.
Liam: I'm going to stealth back to the Debt's Respite.
Matt: Keeping a very close watch on the path you took and marking it mentally back to the Debt's Respite. It's probably a good mile off from where you guys were, if not a little further. You guys continue your conversation, go about your own business. Eventually, Vax returns with the information, the path of wherever this letter was dropped off to.
Travis: Just curious, have you ever had the Sandkheg Hide?
Matt: "Are you serious?"
Travis: Yeah. I'm just asking.
Matt: "No, I ain't drinking that bullshit."
Travis: Really?
Matt: "Yeah."
Travis: Too stiff for you?
Matt: "Too stiff for anyone! It's-- what?"
Travis: I mean, I hear only real bosses can drink that jazz.
Matt: "That's not a drink. That's probably squeezed from the arsehole of some sort of beast out in the desert. I prefer my stuff taken from berries and the sweet stuff."
Travis: What do you mean, some beast? Who'd make a drink out of some animal's whatever?
Matt: "Have you have some, have you tasted it?"
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: "Then I guess you know what an animal's bum tastes like, eh?"
Travis: (sputters) Hold on. You mean they squeeze the asshole of something out there?
Matt: "Oh, completely!"
Travis: No!
Matt: "They hold it down and just squeeze its abdomen and the whole sandkheg spews out into this little glass barrel and then you pay for it. Top dollar."
Travis: Yeah, it's 300 something gold!
Matt: "Oh, did you buy some?"
Travis: No.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: You brain is filled with image of whatever creature your imagination has come up with being held down.
Travis: It's a giant, hairy water yak.
Matt: And it is squeezing some sort of yellowish liquid from its abdomen into a glass wine bottle, and you're now looking over at Percy and Keyleth who had just had sips of this earlier. It's not sitting well with your stomach.
Travis: We were gifted a bottle, and a couple of my friends had partook.
Matt: (cackles)
Travis: They say the stuff we had is A-plus.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Vax now appears at the edge of the table.
Laura: Oh, hi!
Liam: Hey. Took a little walk.
Laura: Let's go to the rooms. Let's check it out. How about that?
Liam: Sure.
Laura: Thank you for the rooms. Breakfast? Is there breakfast here?
Matt: (scoffs) "No, you find your own food."
Laura: Awesome.
Marisha: Does he still have some drink in front of him?
Matt: It hasn't been filled since, no.
Marisha: Oh, never mind.
Matt: Do you guys head to your rooms? Okay. You make your way up to the rooms. They're all clean, serviceable, nothing too fancy, but functional rooms. Each with two beds.
Taliesin: I want to check for anything unusual, if there's anything iffy about the rooms.
Matt: Investigation check.
Laura: Oh, I would follow suit.
Matt: Investigation check.
Taliesin: Oh, for the love of fucking--
Matt: Natural one?
Taliesin: No. Nine.
Matt: Nine. Nothing seems to be out of place or out of the ordinary.
Taliesin: Obviously.
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13? Seems to be a room.
Sam: I'm just going to check under the beds, that's it.
Matt: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Sam: 29!
Matt: 29. You find dust, dead insects, a dried-out rodent husk, and that's it.
Liam: Grog, you want to bunk up?
Travis: Yeah, sure. Are we going two to a room?
Liam: Yeah, there's six of us.
Matt: It's also about 3 00 in the afternoon.
Liam: I know that. I'm not going to go lie down on the floor. I just thought I'd call dibs.
Travis: Yeah. Cool.
Laura: Scanlan, then. Me and you?
Sam: Sure!
Laura: No. I'm kidding. I don't want to be in the same room with you at all.
Sam: Oh, I need a bucket and a mop.
Laura: No. You're with him.
Marisha: I'm with Vex.
Taliesin: Yes. What?
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Have fun!
Taliesin: With-- not-- no!
Liam: That's later.
Laura: What did you see?
Liam: Yeah, so we've got a backup plan because I followed whoever that person was back to where they dropped off. We should probably honor the offer first. If that goes sideways, then we have a backup plan.
Taliesin: It's so rare that we're actually given an opportunity to be honest about everything. We might as well try it once, see if we like it.
Sam: But do you know where this person receives her messages?
Liam: Absolutely.
Taliesin: Good.
Travis: Where is it?
Liam: Well, I don't know the names of the streets. I remember what it looked like. If you want to follow me, it's about a mile off. It looked like a furniture store. A Kingly Rest.
Laura: And you didn't even have to say jenga!
Liam: Wonders never cease.
Travis: A Kingly Rest. All right.
Matt: What are you guys doing?
Liam: Well, the casino's tonight. The deal's off. We can't get Grog in a fight.
Laura: Do you have a red shirt, Scanlan? Do we need to get you one?
Sam: Do we own anything red? Grog?
Travis: What?
Sam: Do we have anything red?
Travis: We have three fancy robes left.
Matt: You do not own a red shirt, but you could probably find one. Not too difficult.
Sam: All right. I'll find one. Take 20 minutes.
Matt: It doesn't take you too long. Costs you two silver pieces. You find a nice red shirt, billowing sleeves. It's totally up your alley.
Sam: Okay, great!
Travis: Can we go back out to the bazaar? Are far from there, or are we still close?
Matt: He's gone through the bazaar. You're not too far from it. Maybe a ten-minute walk.
Travis: They sell any weapons?
Laura: And potions. We need potions.
Taliesin: Trinkets.
Travis: Can I look and see if people are selling weapons?
Matt: You walk around. and there are weapons being sold.
Travis: Are there any exotic weapons?
Matt: No. Most weapons you find here are ornamental; they're for decoration. They're for putting above mantelpieces. There are various blades that have bolting mechanisms in the back where you can easily mount them to a wall. None of them, that you can see, at least, that are open in this bazaar for sale, are presented as an actual item for warfare.
Travis: Okay.
Taliesin: Is there a magic shop?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Marisha: Come on, Percy. Roll something good. That's better!
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19. Asking about, you do come to, within the bazaar, a small wooden building that's like a hut, but it's constructed of dark wood panels. It resembles those strange marionette performance boxes.
Taliesin: Punch and Judy box, yeah.
Matt: Except it just has this one frazzled-looking young woman standing there with long strands of curly dark brown hair. Red lips, dark eyeshadow. She's eagerly looking out with a sign in the front that reads, "Oddities and Eccentricities."
Taliesin: Good day.
Marisha: Be pleased.
Matt: "Good day."
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Matt: "Be pleased to you as well."
Taliesin: I'm stocked up on eccentricities, but if you have any oddities for sale, I'd be very interested.
Matt: "There are many oddities at my disposal. I'm Nisaba."
Taliesin: Percival. Hello.
Matt: "What kind of oddities are you looking for?"
Taliesin: Honestly, this is my first time in the city, and I'm trying to get a sense of what's available for sale and what sorts of things one would find in the city, so really, I'm interested in touring your stock, especially if you have anything exotic.
Matt: "Well, let me show you." Over the next five minutes, she brings out all sorts of strange knickknacks. It's essentially a display from the most awkward of vintage Salvation Armies you've ever come across.
Taliesin: God, we've found a hipster.
Matt: However, you do catch a quick flash of what appears to be some small crystalline vials that appear to be strapped to some sort of leather bandolier.
Taliesin: Well, that's interesting. What do you call that?
Matt: "This is for, well, a gentleman who passed through many years ago, who claimed to be a great alchemist, sold this off when he had come into a lot of debt within the city, so I made a good price. No one has really showed much interest in it."
Taliesin: Interesting. May I? May I take a look at it?
Matt: "You may."
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: The leather's finely made, if a little worn. The chemicals inside-- one of them does have a familiar color, a deep herbal red. This looks to be some sort of a low to medium level healing potion, most likely, from your experience in the use of that. The two others are grayish and murky and don't really draw your attention or anything you're familiar with.
Taliesin: Interesting.
Marisha: Percy, what's that?
Taliesin: I don't know. It's quite nice, though, isn't it?
Marisha: Well. Can I do a check on the other two potions to see with my potion knowledge? My potion sense?
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Not bad. Just straight intelligence? 15.
Matt: 15. They do appear to have been prepared in the way that you prepare magically enchanted vials for potions themselves, but you're not really able to make out just at a glance. You'd have to spend quite a time to make out what their nature is.
Marisha: I'd have to look at it. Not familiar, sorry. That looks like a health potion, though.
Taliesin: Yeah. It does look a bit--
Marisha: Healthy.
Sam: It's like Storage Wars. Just buy it. Who knows what's in there?
Taliesin: What were you hoping to unload for it?
Matt: "Well, knowing that is now a magic potion of healing and two other magical potions, that is a very valuable belt with its contents. I would sell you just the belt for five silver pieces. To include the vials, and they do come as a set, unfortunately, that would run you 275 gold pieces."
Taliesin: Now, see, we don't know what kind of healing potion that is, and those other two vials could have-- there is an expiration date on those things. And how long have you had it?
Matt: "We've had it for a number of years."
Taliesin: A number of years? Well, in that case, they've probably gone stale by now. I would say 75 gold at the very best.
Matt: (chuckles) "That is not going to work." She reaches out and takes the belt away from you and sets it back down on the inside.
Taliesin: 75 gold will not do you for that, then?
Matt: "For the belt, maybe."
Taliesin: For the belt, obviously. We've already established that that's in the silver range and certainly not touching the gold.
Matt: "Right, but you're willing to have and to offer that 75 gold for it, please."
Taliesin: 75 gold for the entire set.
Matt: "No, it's not going to work. I'm sorry."
Taliesin: No, and of course that makes sense that a hundred gold for that entire set would be very fair.
Liam: I'm starting to take a nap against a column standing up.
Sam: Just buy it.
Taliesin: 100 gold. You've had it for so long.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: This is going to go terribly. Where's my persuasion? Ooh, that's almost a number. Oh, good. 16?
Matt: She goes, "225 gold for the set."
Taliesin: 200. And an acknowledgement and compliment to your stunning hair. I'm attempting to flirt very poorly.
Travis: (laughing) That eyebrow.
Matt: Make a charisma check.
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: Just a straight charisma modifier to your roll.
Liam: Come on, snitch.
Taliesin: Come on. 12.
Laura: You flirted with grass better!
Matt: She goes, "I appreciate your patronage, but I am a patient woman, and that is how I hold business." (laughter)
Travis: Stonewalled!
Taliesin: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yes?
Taliesin: I feel like I should have learned some sort of lesson here. I'm just not entirely sure what it was.
Marisha: Oh, you know--
Taliesin: Hardly matters, I suppose.
Marisha: Maybe you'll come to it at the end of being in Ank'Harel.
Travis: Hey, guys. I had a thought. You know we were all supposed to have a meeting with the king? And I haven't been paying attention if anyone's watching, and we got time to kill. Should we go have a talk with the big man?
Laura: Or at least put in for an audience.
Travis: Yeah. Who knows if they'll even get to us today?
Taliesin: I'm sobering up a bit. Which we should probably do that.
Laura: Does it seem like a long walk towards the Cerulean Palace?
Matt: Maybe a 45-minute to an hour walk.
Liam: We've got hours and hours before we have to do anything.
Taliesin: We do. It's 4 00 in the afternoon.
Laura: What time's the sun set here? Can I ask somebody?
Matt: You ask around. It looks to probably be about four hours from sunset.
Taliesin: Perfect.
Sam: All right. Fine. Let's go.
Marisha: Plus, the best way to see a new city is to walk, you guys!
Taliesin: Wait, hold on. I have to open my Pokémon.
Matt: So you guys are making your way towards the Cerulean Palace. As you approach the large, extremely imposing palace, you come upon what looks to be an endless series of stairs that brings you to the upper platform that is the central portion of the city where the palace seems to reside, eventually peaking in the Sandherald district that you were referred to earlier as the location of the palace and where the Bowl of Judgment exists. You step up to the very top of the stairs to find yourself already breathless at the sight of the immense purple-blue-colored palace. A dozen towers reach for the clouds, the daylight peeking through their slightly translucent material, like glassy waters ever-frozen in a fall. The central tower, the one that caught your eye, that ends in a large cup-like position, rises above all of them with a slight spiral-type texture to the outside of the palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of the cityscape. As you get closer, you can see the main palace structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at their apex in its structure, smaller and smaller as it recesses further into the palace. Its very architectural build is a marvel, and seems to both have consistency and a chaotic feel to the placement of some of these arches too, in size. It's a very strange but fascinating structure. You can also see turquoise detailing and trim against many of the pillars and carvings and statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of this palace. As you approach what appear to be the front gates that ascend, with a very bright blue turquoise exterior, close to 50 Hands of Ord patrol various elements of the grounds around it. It looks like there are actual pockets of grass and gardens that exist around the Cerulean Palace in here. The topography changes almost to feel like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle of the desert. The guards do eye you suspiciously as you approach, and you watch as one armored woman, her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an ornate helmet of brass and blue, approaches you guys. "Welcome to the Cerulean Palace. I must ask your business here."
Laura: Forgive us for our intrusion. We come seeking an audience of J'mon Sa Ord.
Matt: "Our emperor does not take meetings. My apologies, but I must ask you to leave."
Taliesin: We are, in fact, a group of ambassadors from the continent of Emon, from the cities of--
Marisha: Continent of Tal'Dorei, city of Emon. It concerns the fate of the world.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Which one?
Taliesin: Not that one. That one. See? Listen to me. I'm not taking credit for that.
Marisha: 23. No, 24.
Matt: 24. "Let me inquire with the Grand Maven." She turns around, her armor clinking, and walks back to the palace, leaving you guys there amongst these courtyard grounds. A few moments pass before she returns, the doors opening. As she descends, next to her you see an older woman with these long, ceremonial robes that drag behind her, spilling across the stairs as she descends, seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle as she walks with each step. She wears a tall headdress with what looks like brass quills that press behind her head and down her back. As she approaches you all, the woman earlier that you spoke to, the Hand that approached you, stays behind quietly and watches, weapon at the ready. The woman steps forward with a smile, and unlike the abrasive appearance that most of the Hand have given, she seems to be more welcoming, and gives, for the first time since you've been here, a very formal welcoming bow with her hand before her, the other hand out. Says, "Be pleased, everyone."
All: Be pleased.
Matt: "I must apologize. We were not aware of your arrival here. I am the Grand Maven Gameshega. Please, enter and follow me."
Travis: She's the what?
Marisha: Gameshega?
Matt: Gameshega.
Laura: Gameshega.
Liam: Gameshega.
Marisha: Gameshega?
Matt: Gameshega.
Liam: Gameshega.
Taliesin: This is good. This is very good.
Matt: As she walks past you and the female Hand that saw you earlier steps aside and watches you as you pass, then ends up stepping behind you and flanking, keeping a watch from the back as you guys are led up the final staircase, through the front turquoise gates of the Cerulean Palace, and they close behind you with a resounding (impact), the impact echoing through these long halls. From the interior, massive pointed archways that lead down ornately decorated halls that echo with each footfall that hits across what looks like endless white and black bespeckled marble. She leads you through a series of hallways, more Hands walking past, as well as a number of other robed individuals. What appears to be a central chamber that has a number of steps and seats, where it looks like various philosophers are in mid-heated discussion in once again, this same language that you have not heard on your ears before. You are eventually brought to a very intricate and decorated waiting room, with some finely upholstered silk chairs, couches. The Grand Maven stops. "If you would not mind, please have a seat."
Taliesin: Of course.
Sam: Sure, yeah.
Matt: She walks into a nearby doorway. It looks like a single door that leads into a small-looking room, from the brief moment you have to see it. The door closes and you hear a (magic sound). Two minutes pass. Five minutes pass. Ten eerie, quiet minutes pass.
Travis: Windows in this room?
Matt: No windows in this particular room, but you notice as you take a close look, the roofs, while they are built of this deep blue, almost glass-like thick crystal, they're ever so slightly translucent, and it gives this general blue glow about the entire room. You can't make out any details from the outside, but there is this strange translucence to the entire structure.
Travis: Was that the only door to the room?
Matt: There is the hallway that you left behind, but there standing in the doorway is the same Hand that approached you guys and has been keeping an eye the entire time.
Laura: He's in the room with us?
Matt: Is away from you, standing in the large archway hall that led you into this waiting room.
Laura: I'm up and pacing the room, trying to pace near the door that she went through so I can keep an ear on the door.
Travis: I walk up to the guard, and I say, sorry. I really should have peed before I came in. Is there a privy I could use?
Matt: She glances at you. "You look like a strapping young man. Perhaps you can hold onto that for a time."
Travis: It looks that way, but I also have a strapping-sized bladder, and I've been known to leave strapping-sized messes in corners. You see, I don't really come from all this finery, so the side of the wall is just as good with me. It's just I'm trying to be polite.
Matt: She leans behind the hallway. (foreign language) "Just a moment." Another guard walks up behind and kicks a bucket into the room.
Travis: That'll do.
Liam: Put up or shut up.
Laura: Can I hear anything from the other side of the door?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'm laughing out loud.
Sam: One?
Matt: You have your ear up against the wall.
Laura: I didn't want to have my ear against the wall. I wanted to be subtly doing it.
Matt: Well, you're subtly doing it, and there's nothing. You get closer and closer, and there's nothing. The rest of you hear (magic sounds), but you're still-- Eventually, the door opens again, and there the Grand Maven stands again. She looks up to the rest of you. "Come with me. You have been granted an audience." She steps back into the chamber.
Laura: That happened much easier than I expected.
Travis: Thank you for the bucket. I'll hold it.
Laura: Are you sure, Grog?
Liam: We were convincing.
Sam: They must know who we are.
Taliesin: Trust our luck. Our luck is going. I'm walking into this.
Sam: Anyone says jenga, kill everyone we meet.
Liam: It's the only plan we have.
Taliesin: I'm walking into it.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You walk into what is a cylindrical chamber of smooth blue-purple quartz-like material with four strands of heavy chains taut between the ceiling and floor, about 15 feet above you. No other exit. You all enter and the door closes behind you, the Maven still relaxing, her arms to her side, her headdress still giving her this ominous presence. Looks up, and there's a (impact) shuddering sound. Suddenly, the bland, uncharacteristic walls, compared to the rest of the palace, begin to slide past the chains, now making this rattling sound as the floor itself seems to be lurching. You feel a bit of pressure in the room that wasn't there before. You're all being lifted, and the walls, now no longer walled in by the rest of the palace, you can now see this occasional traveling-down line as the spiral on the outside of the tower you once saw now surrounds you. The walls are much thinner than the rest of the palace, as you can see through this somewhat-translucent glass exterior the entirety of Emon surrounding you from upon high as it goes lower and lower as you're lifted higher and higher into this tower.
Laura: This is miraculous!
Matt: It's very off-putting, but beautiful at the same time. Everything's seen through this shimmering, somewhat-refracted blue passage. As you go higher and higher, you can see the countless homes, walls, and towers getting smaller and smaller, other towers eventually ending as you go higher in the tower. The Maven says, "I request you do not touch the walls, please."
Sam: Okay.
Travis: I really want to touch the walls.
Matt: The view reveals the entirety of the city around you, and beyond that, the distant dunes and the desert that seems to have no end. You view a far-off mountainscape a little bit in the northern direction that just begins to peek past your view, then (boom) the floor ceases again. You all seem to lurch for a moment, yourself, an inch before you catch yourself on your feet. The Maven catches herself, very used to this transition. You now see behind her, where it has stopped, there is another set of doors, similar to the ones you entered from in the bottom portion of this tower. The door opens, (creak) and you can see the next room is a set of staircases of the same color that slowly curl off and disappear upward above you. "Please, follow me." She walks in, her robe dragging behind her. You guys give enough berth for it to follow. As you're led up the stairway, choosing right or left, they both lead to the upper platform in what is the top of the central tower of the Cerulean Palace. As you enter this room, you see close to a hundred dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of multitudes of different colors; rainbowscapes of beautiful translucent cloths and silks, gently flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into each other around the outside of the wall. High arched windows on each side, and behind, what looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds surrounding this height and obfuscating certain portions as they meet with the height of this tower's apex. You see a large balcony from the opposite side of the room that is opened from its own similar-sized arch that extends outward. It has a railing about four feet up that is an opening that overlooks in open air all above the city to see. In the center of the chamber, you see a series of step-like platforms, circular, that rise up upon each other, and in the center, you see what seems to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that probably sits ten feet up from the base. Thin, but extremely long and widens towards the top. You can see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into this shiny, ruddy metallic material that frames the entirety of the throne. And there sitting atop this throne, you see a slender, human-like entity wearing no jewelry, no ceremonial adornments, no crown, just a simple brown cotton shirt over simple, elegant pants. Bare feet, no shoes. Androgynous and beautiful; you're unable to make out the sex of this creature. It's not a man, nor elf. Not fey, but something somewhat alien, almost. The skin a deep-set reddish brown, smooth and impeccable. The features are extremely fine and delicate. The eyes are what catch you: black like night, but the pupils, burning points of molten metal. The entity smiles and stands off the throne. Now, at this height, seeing it standing almost as tall as Grog, by comparison. The limbs are elongated. Extends a hand towards you as you step into the chamber. "Welcome to Ank'Harel, heroes of Tal'Dorei. I am J'mon Sa Ord, and it is my pleasure to greet you." And that is where we'll pick up our session in two weeks.
Laura: Oh shit, two weeks.
Matt: Two weeks.
Marisha: Two weeks.
Sam: Wow, guys. We did a lot of strange things.
Marisha: Yes, that was a weird day.
Travis: It's the pharaoh king from Stargate.
Matt: Yeah. We have two weeks until we pick up from that point in the story. Next week, look forward once again to Liam running his awesome one-shot.
Liam: I've got a party planned for you!
Matt: It's going to be awesome. It's been fun. But anyway, guys, thank you so much. Hope you had a fun time. Much love to all of you in the community. You're awesome; thank you so much for your support. Thank you for supporting our wonderful charities. 826 has been awesome, and they keep showing up. We saw recently in Target ads, actually, which is fantastic, so thank you guys so much for keeping up with them. You can still give them money. You can still support 826LA, as well as any of the other charities we have listed in our Guide to Critmas on the website. Those are great ways to give and great ways to support all of these wonderful people out there doing wonderful things.
Travis: And thank you, Loot Crate.
Matt: And thank you, Loot Crate, for your support of this show and support of our community, giving them an awesome discount. However, most of us will now adjourn to finish signing the posters forever.
Laura: Some of us are done.
Taliesin: Some of us will be doing it until the end of time.
Matt: Finishing for a lot of us.
Taliesin: Are we finishing tonight?
Matt: Finishing this weekend, so they should be going out soon to you guys. Thank you for your patience. The first batch of posters are now out. This batch will go out soon.
Liam: The desert awaits, Matt.
Matt: The desert waits for us, and it is much needed. Much love to you all. Have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: [NO AUDIO]
Sam: -- about the company itself who so kindly sponsors us and about their founder, one Ebenezer Lootacrata. Born on a silk-worm farm in Budapest in 1919, Ebenezer Lootacrata was a unique child. His siblings-- Claudrica, Piterca, Dominocos, and Bob-- would always play checkers, but Ebenezer was fascinated by the box they came in. In fact, he was obsessed with boxes. Did he wear briefs? No, boxers. He traded in his backpack for a backbox. He wouldn't eat jelly from jars. He scooped it out of a large pine jelly box. Dick-in-a-box? He invented that in 1930. And in 1937 he packed up everything that was special to him-- one shirt, one sticker, one comic book, and one toy-- placed them in a crate and set off for college. One day later, he was expelled from college because he did not own pants. But he had a vision! A revolutionary idea! Before, people had boxes and people had cool stuff, but he dared to put the cool stuff inside the boxes! He named his company "Lootacrata". In America we bastardize it as Loot Crate, but history has never been the same.
Matt: Thank you, Sam. Very informative.
Sam: And you guys should know that you should go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Promo code this week, to celebrate the arrival of Taryon Darrington to Critical Role, please use code "Tary", that's T-A-R-Y, for 10% off your first month's order. We at Loot Crate welcome Taryon Darrington and look forward to his adventures. He totally isn't the worst. Definitely not the worst character to ever appear on Critical Role. Actually, we've changed our mind. Please use the code "criticalrole". (all laugh)
Travis: Do you know how many people are going to go to their website and enter in "Taryon". They're like "What the fuck!?" "Code not received."
Marisha: It's an ARG, I know it!
Matt: Exactly.
Taliesin: It's perfect. They'll enter 'Tary' and be disappointed.
Matt: Tary's the new Sombra. (all laugh)
Marisha: My subscription went up three dollars? Aw. (all laugh)
Matt: Hey, at least it's in character.
Marisha: Worse.
Matt: Thank you, Sam. Appreciate it. All righty, so, a number of us, if the weather is with us-- as a giant storm apparently just blew into the west coast-- are intending to fly out tomorrow to Anime Milwaukee. So it'll be me and Marisha--
Travis: Wisconsin!
Matt: Yes!
Marisha: It's gonna be cold.
Matt: It's gonna be cold. With Travis, Laura, myself, and Marisha will be out there along with a bunch of other awesome guests, so hopefully we'll see you guys there very soon. Also, as far as the merch goes, apparently we're out of dice! Right? We're out of dice. Dice are gone.
Laura: We even ordered a lot this time, but we're out.
Sam: But what will the people do? What will they roll?
Laura: Well, maybe they'll roll something extra special later. I don't know.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: You speak like you know what you're talking about.
Travis: What a tease. What a tease.
Sam: You have no idea.
Laura: We do still have bracelets. We do still have pins. We do still have a few socks left. We still have shirts!
Taliesin: The Gilmore shirt is back--
Laura: We have Gilmore shirts. We have a few-- We have Strongjaw shirts! Are you wearing yours?
Travis: Nope.
Laura: No.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: There's our Critical Role logo shirt! All these shirts are still available in the store!
Liam: He's wearing it on his face. That's Strongjaw.
Laura: This is Strong-- this is a strong jaw.
Liam: Wears it every day.
Taliesin: You should work in radio.
Travis: They don't want me.
Laura: That's all I got.
Matt: No worries. Thank you, Laura. Marisha, do you want to talk about Signal Boost? I guess Amy Dallen just had her run, right?
Marisha: Yeah! Amy Dallen had her episode. It's great. This week is Eric Campbell coming up in the run. And you should go-- (airhorn noises)-- and you should go watch 'em.
Laura: We gotta stop.
Marisha: Yeah, where does that end? Once you stop-- once you pop you just don't stop-- oh god, now it's a Pringles reference. Okay, go watch Signal Boost!
Matt: (laughs) Well done!
Sam: And eat Pringles. (all laugh)
Marisha: Not boosted on the Signal Boost. But could be!
Matt: Indeed. (In Scottish accent) And there's a new thing called Wednesday Club. You want to talk about that? What's that about, Taliesin? Tell us about that!
Taliesin: For anybody who reads comic books normally, you know that Wednesdays is when comic books get released at comic book stores all across the country. And if you're a big comic book nerd-- and you had a really fun comic book store-- you would go on a Wednesday night and hang out with all the other comic book nerds and have six-week-long conversations on who would win in a fight, Superman or Thor.
Sam: Thor.
Taliesin: Superman.
Travis: Superman.
Taliesin: Actually, funny enough. You don't go to a Wednesday Club, so you--
Sam: Thor's a god.
Taliesin: Well, now you have a show to watch. So now that I don't really have time to do that any more, we thought it would be fun to just do it here with all of our comic book nerds, so Amy Dallen and Matt Key and I are going to be talking comics every Wednesday from noon to two on the Twitch stream and we're going to--
Laura: Yay!
Taliesin: Yay!
Marisha: New shows!
Taliesin: New show! The Wednesday Club, and we're going to try and make it fun to watch, and easy if you've not picked up a book in ages and you've maybe thought about getting into comics, or you had some kids and now the comic books have just turned into giant shreds of paper.
Marisha: Yeah, it's not a news show.
Taliesin: We're not talking news. We're just talking fun, cool comic book facts, and our first episode is going to be "Origin Stories" were we talk about why we got into comic books, and then starting the week after we're going to be talking about cool characters, team-ups, classic runs of books, anything and everything. It's going to be great.
Travis: Crossovers?
Taliesin: No crossovers. Never mention crossovers.
Sam: Special guests?
Taliesin: Special guests! We will have special guests and not-so-special guests-- you can come, too. So yes! Wednesday Club, we'll be talking about comic books! It's going to be great!
Laura: Yaaay!
Liam: So exciting!
Matt: Thank you, Taliesin.
Taliesin: Check us out on Wednesday.
Matt: Also, there's a game called For Honor that just came out that a couple of you assholes are in.
Liam: Oh, it's on the shelves, we've been playing it for weeks here!
Travis: Yeah!
Liam: You can play it as well if you go to your local shop or download it or get it at a store--I already said that but you can play samurais-- we have no samurais here. You can play knights-- Hey!-- or you can play Vikings-- you can use this guy!
Travis: Buuhh, Vikings!
Laura: What kind of Viking are you?
Travis: (loud belch) The male raider.
Laura: The raider.
Travis: It comes out Tuesday, February 14th on all gaming platforms.
Laura: That's yesterday.
Matt: That was two days ago.
Travis: It's Valentine's Day-- I didn't... miss... (all laugh)
Laura: Our Valentine's Day consisted of me making chili and then us going to Menchie's.
Travis: And farting a lot.
Laura: Yup!
Matt: There ya go!
Laura: It was a gooood Valentine's Day.
Taliesin: It's good chili, to be fair.
Matt: You got out of the house, though.
Travis: That's true.
Marisha: We watched Jurassic World and Suicide Squad.
Travis: You did both of those?
Marisha: We wanted to get caught up on our, like--
Matt: Bad movies.
Marisha: -- questionably bad movies.
Travis: That's a bunch of stank.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: No, we had to sit quietly for an hour afterward, just to take it all in.
Marisha: My favorite is Rick Flag just shouting exposition through Suicide Squad and that's his purpose.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Including Katana's needless arrival-- Anyway! This is not this night's game of D&D.
Taliesin: I went to Underworld and met some Critters, it was good.
Matt: That's awesome!
Marisha: Oh! That's a better Valentine's Day.
Liam: You know, honestly, you two having the time to sit down and watch two bad movies--
Travis: Here it comes.
Liam: When I don't have time to watch one good movie--
Laura: Here we go. Here we go.
Liam: -- is offensive. That is offensive to me.
Travis: You have the joy of children in your life!
Marisha: Yeah!
Laura: That's right.
Travis: The beacons of hope in life. Of future generations. (all laugh)
Marisha: You have spawn.
Laura: Gulp gulp gulp gulp!
Travis: He's so thirsty! He's just dehydrated.
Marisha: They'll be holding your hand, you know, in later years.
Liam: It will help me when I'm dying. That is true--
Taliesin: Pushing you slowly off the edge.
Matt: Yes. We're just gonna be somewhere in a forest, lost, screaming to each other, Help! So that's our future.
Liam: I guess it's time to climb this mountain and throw myself off.
Travis: That's a good way to go.
Matt: Cultural heritage of ours.
Marisha: This is my child. This's what I've accomplished.
Matt: Last but not least, quick little note, due to the current difficulties with green cards and people that are in the country who weren't born here, one of our fantastic crew members, Amandine, unfortunately is having to leave and go back to Switzerland. This is her last episode of Critical Role. She's been a tremendously amazing member of our team, and we've loved having her here, and we certainly know this is not the last we'll see of her, but this'll be her last show for awhile, so I just wanted to bring her out and say hi to the community real fast.
Travis: Aw, yeah! Come on out! (all applaud)
Matt: Come here. You've been amazing.
Amandine: Thank you.
Sam: If anyone would like to sponsor-slash-marry her, she could stay-- (all laugh)
Sam: -- and she could stay on the crew. Just a quick little marriage.
Matt: We all tried, everyone here did our best, but we're going to miss you terribly and you've been amazing.
Amandine: I will miss you too.
Marisha: I know, you've been great, man.
Laura: You're amazing.
Marisha: She's been working on Talks Machina, kicking ass.
Matt: Yeah, she's been kicking ass on set.
Sam: She's why it looks good now.
Marisha: Really, yeah.
Matt: Seriously, so, everyone send your love, give your hearts out, and yeah, we'll look forward to seeing your adventures as you progress and we'll bring you back as soon as we can. We'll find a way.
Amandine: Okay.
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: We love you!
Matt: Thank you.
Amandine: Thank you, guys.
Travis: Woo-woo!
Sam: Let's bring the show to her!
Matt: Yeah, perfect! We're coming to Switzerland!
Taliesin: I'm okay with that.
Matt: Guys. Let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode... of Critical Role. [opening credits]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. So. As we left off on the adventures of Vox Machina, you had just finished destroying the long-standing reign and terrorizing assault of the Chroma Conclave across the face of Tal'Dorei. As you finished that chapter, defeating Raishan and collecting the remnants of the necromancer's sanctum of where the final battle took place, you returned with the unfortunately fallen corpse of your friend, Scanlan Shorthalt. You succeeded in the resurrection, however upon returning from Vasselheim, Scanlan coming to consciousness, it was discovered that Scanlan was in a place in his life where he needed to take some time with his estranged and recently discovered daughter. And arguments ensued, and agreement was had that he would step away from Vox Machina to follow his own path. The group took a period to mourn, and then began to decide what their next layer of plans were, what loose ends still were held out there, and you made your way to the city of Ank'Harel on the continent of Marquet to return the right hand of Ripley, the person responsible for assassinating a member of the Scarbearers within the Debt's Respite tavern in the city. As you made your way past the bazaar towards the inn, on the outside you saw what appeared to be a large humanoid structure built of iron and metal walking on its own behind a very flashily dressed blond gentleman with goatee and a, for lack of a better term, braggartly demeanor who managed to weasel his way into the company of Vox Machina and to continue his adventures alongside theirs as his robot friend Doty continued to archive it in his book of his adventures. And that is where we left off. As you guys step into the relatively empty interior of the Debt's Respite at this hour, with this individual Taryon Darrington in tow.
Travis: Is that really his name?
Laura: That's his name.
Sam: Still his name.
Laura: Taryon Darrington.
Sam: Still his name.
Laura: We agreed to bring him along because he's paying us.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: That is an important fact.
Matt: That is a very important fact.
Travis: Oi, T-- Tar--
Sam: Friends call me Tary, Jumbo.
Travis: Tary Jumbo.
Sam: No, you're Jumbo, I'm Tary.
Travis: Jumbo-- Tar-- I'm Tary. Can you spell out your name for me on a piece of parchment?
Sam: Sure. Do you write?
Travis: Frequently.
Sam: T-A-R-Y-O-N-D-A-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N
Travis: No, no. I asked you to spell it out on a piece of parchment.
Sam: Oh, you want me to write it down.
Travis: Yeah, I'm, uh, I study handwriting.
Sam: I understand. A scholarly mind is not a thing to shirk. Doty, write out my name in the finest calligraphy and give him a page.
Matt: (writing noises) And the hand seems to pick up speed and start rapidly whipping across the page--
Travis: Whoa.
Matt: (tearing paper noise) Tears it out and presents it to you rather forcefully just over Taryon's head. And it is pretty fine calligraphy, actually. Not that you can appreciate it.
Travis: I know.
Matt: It just looks like a god damn scribble. (all laugh)
Laura: Scribbles!
Travis: Mm! Yes. Uh-huh. Thank you.
Sam: You're quite welcome, Jumbo.
Travis: Oh my god, behind you!
Sam: What, what is it?
Travis: It was nothing. I'm always looking out for this group, though. Thank you.
Sam: Are you the leader of this collection of individuals? You are the biggest.
Travis: No, I'm--
Laura: Our leader isn't with us right now.
Travis: Yeah, just the biggest.
Sam: Hm. All right. Have we already begun our mission that we're on right now?
Travis: Nope.
Sam: Oh.
Travis: We just got here and then you started talking.
Sam: You're right.
Taliesin: I'm getting drinks for everybody. I assume we've got the table at this point.
Matt: The entire establishment pretty much is full except for a couple of individuals that you remember from before who are kind of masquerading as patrons, but each, while they have their drink in front of them, they haven't touched it, and they have their hand on the side of their sword belts. At the bar, there is nobody currently manning it. And as this conversation's occurring you do see the familiar face of Treev Bonebreaker, the bronze Dragonborn who is the Scarbearer Head here within the facility, turn the corner into the room. It looks like he's wiping out what looks to be a large tankard, as he kind of like gives it a shine and looks over. "Well, look at that. It looks like they all returned. It's not often you see folks who are at least trying to stick to their word."
Laura: Well, that's us--
Travis: We've been here before?
Laura: -- promise keepers. Yes, dear.
Travis: Oh.
Taliesin: We're trying to stick to our word at the very least.
Marisha: Key word is 'try'. Mainly by avoiding death at this point.
Matt: One would recommend that.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Vax? Who has--
Laura: Grog.
Taliesin: Grog!
Laura: I believe.
Marisha: The bag of holding.
Travis: Oh god, don't point to me, I forgot we were even here.
Laura: Or maybe, unless you meant to say me and you said Vax.
Taliesin: No!
Laura: Because why would Vax have anything, I'm the one with the bag of colding.
Liam: See, actually, this is one of those instances where it sounded halfway between Vax and Vex--
Taliesin: It was not, it was a "Vax."
Liam: It could work for either of us.
Taliesin: I will definitely, I will stand behind that.
Marisha: Sure, it was like a long 'a' like a Vaaax.
Laura: Vaaax.
Liam: It's the "ae" thing.
Taliesin: It was Vax, it was not a Vex.
Sam: What's your name? I am a bit confused at what's going on here so-- (all laugh)
Sam: What's your name?
Matt: Treev. What's your name?
Sam: Taryon Darrington. You may have heard of me. Friends call me Tary.
Matt: No.
Sam: Well, you will once my book comes out.
Taliesin: I don't think that-- no.
Matt: Who's this fucker?
Laura: We don't know.
Taliesin: We don't know.
Marisha: We don't know.
Travis: Tary Jumbo.
Taliesin: He just sort of found us outside. And he had, honestly--
Laura: Just ignore him, really. How about that?
Taliesin: We're not entirely sure what happened here.
Matt: Ah, there's some fancy garb you're wearing.
Sam: Oh, yes. Quite fancy.
Matt: Good to know.
Sam: Deadly as well.
Matt: Anyway.
Laura: Grog--
Matt: He leans forward. "So what? Are you here to talk--"
Taliesin: Grog?
Matt: "-- or drink?  You here to talk?"
Laura: Shall we bust it out here or do you want to talk in private?
Matt: He does a quick scan of the room. "It's my people and you. Might as well."
Laura: Should I dig into the bag of holding?
Travis: What? I don't even remember being here!
Laura: Okay, I'm just gonna reach in the bag of holding and pull out the hand.
Matt: Okay, and you do. You find the mechanical digits of Ripley, plus some of them partially bent from the combat--
Travis: Oh!
Laura: Oh yeah!
Travis: I still don't have it, I'm trying to--
Laura: It's good.
Taliesin: We have the human hand as well. We have the mechanical hand and the human hand.
Marisha: Yeah, we took both.
Taliesin: We took both. We figured we'd have options, if I recall.
Laura: Oh, that's right, I put the regular hand-- did we?
Taliesin: We took both! We took the robot hand and the-- To be fair, I was dead at the time so I don't--
Travis: Tary, we work on very strict rules. If you fuck us, we take your hands.
Sam: You have more than one hand with you right now?
Liam: We have a lot of stuff in that bag.
Laura: You wouldn't even.
Taliesin: Huge collection.
Travis: We really don't know what's in there.
Laura: You don't want to see in there.
Marisha: Lots of body parts.
Taliesin: It's pretty gruesome.
Sam: Okay...
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: You have to ask, then--
Sam: Just tell me when to start swinging the sword.
Travis: Thought you had to-- oh, yeah! And it extends, but--
Sam: Sure.
Matt: Do you pass over the hand?
Laura: Sure!
Matt: While this is happening you kind of slam it down on the table. The giant, bronze dragonborn claw reaches out and grabs it, and rakes it forward, picks it up, and the fingers fall limp in the grasp. And he turns it around in his vision. (sniffs) "It's a strange contraption. Certainly looks like a hand."
Laura: She was a strange woman.
Matt: So you're telling me, this is the one that took out the Mistress Asharru?
Taliesin: I put the Retort Pistol on the table. She used one of these devices.
Matt: "Right, right. Very well." He takes the hand and begins scraping the pistol back with him as well.
Taliesin: The pistol was just for show. It wasn't a gift.
Matt: "All right. Well, at least the Mistress can lay at rest. I thank you for your deed." And he spins his finger in the air and one of the men at the table gets up and walks out of the room and exits through the front door behind you.
Taliesin: I won't pretend that we didn't have our own reasons for it. But we are grateful that you recognize that we respect your authority.
Matt: Takes some balls to come back here and not have anything to show for it. So, glad you got balls, all of you. Except for that one.
Laura: Giant balls. Yeah, his I'm not sure of--
Taliesin: We haven't checked his, to be fair.
Sam: They're quite-- quite lovely. (all laugh)
Matt: Well, I have called off my associates. The hunt is null and void. You're free to wander without worry.
Laura: Thank you, Treev.
Taliesin: We'll probably only be another day or two in town before we head home. Thank you. Thank you for your time.
Laura: We're out.
Travis: Did we not get anything for that?
Laura: We got our lives.
Taliesin: We got someone to remove a debt upon our heads.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: Oh.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: Could we see the debt or was it magic?
Taliesin: It was metaphorical.
Laura: Magic. Pure magic.
Taliesin: Magic. Sure.
Travis: Whoa. Glad we did that. (all laugh)
Matt: Stay for a drink?
Travis: Yes! Yes! Yes!
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: Yeah. Let the big guy play.
Marisha: Sure.
Laura: Sure.
Laura: But I wanna keep an eye out on the bar because I still don't trust our environment.
Matt: Certainly. It's been kinda low-key here for the day.
Travis: Tary, do you drink anything?
Sam: Wine, mostly, yes.
Travis: Does Dottie drink anything?
Sam: Doty.
Travis: Right.
Sam: He does not drink.
Travis: Then that's two for you. I'll have two of your strongest whatevers for blond-chin over there.
Matt: All right. Anyone else?
Taliesin: Yes, please.
Matt: "Round it is." And he goes and he gathers up a number of small mugs, tankards, it's ramshackle in here. This essentially acts as a base of operations first and a tavern a distant second, so it's barely functional really as a comparable establishment for fine drinks and atmosphere, but it works.
Taliesin: Heineken's coming, basically.
Matt: Yeah, yeah. The drinks are passed around, some small talk's made with Treev, discussing just how things have been pretty low-key since Asharru was killed and you guys last left, there hasn't been an upset. There was apparently a vision of some sort of a creature at the top of the Cerulean Palace a few days ago.
Laura: Really?
Matt: But people were wondering if that was a sighting of Devo'ssa, and some of the rather intense historians and younger believers in the myth of Devo'ssa have been up in a tizzy, and Treev just kinda shrugs it off and takes a drink and goes, "Just what we need is another bigger fucking dragon."
Taliesin: Not for a long time, one would hope.
Matt: Aye.
Taliesin: So. Tary?
Sam: Yes?
Taliesin: I have to admit, I'm curious, where did you get your friend there?
Sam: Why, I made him!
Taliesin: Did you?
Sam: Yes, I did?
Taliesin: Really? What's his power? How's he powered? What runs him? I'm just sort of curious.
Sam: I-- no offense, but I doubt you would understand the inner workings of something as complicated as this.
Taliesin: That's a very interesting thought you have there. But, still, I would be just delighted to hear your attempt to simplify it for me.
Sam: All right, I will. Are you familiar with levers? Things that move up and down?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Yes? Some of those. There's also a machine called a pulley where you can apply force and it will amplify it with a wheel and a string.
Taliesin: I think I've read about such things before, yes.
Sam: Some of those are in there. Also, an incline. It's another simple machine.
Taliesin: You didn't build it, did you?
Sam: I did build it.
Taliesin: Did you? Did you build it?
Sam: I did build it.
Taliesin: So, one would assume there's an access panel somewhere on him where one can make adjustments, or otherwise fix him if he breaks down?
Sam: Pretty fancy technological speak.
Taliesin: Thank you. Where would the access panel be?
Sam: Why do you care to know?
Taliesin: Well, just in case you're knocked unconscious by, let's say, someone sneaking up behind you and hitting you with a weapon?
Sam: Won't happen. Doty has my back. Right, Doty?
Matt: At which point Doty crams in right behind and is dwarfing Tary in size with the broad metallic shoulders and is (heavy footfalls)
Taliesin: Doty? Did he build you?
Matt: No response.
Sam: I'm a bit of a tinkerer. I can show you a few things if we have a quiet moment, not in public.
Taliesin: Can you?
Travis: Holy fuck.
Taliesin: That would be... excellent.
Sam: I look forward to the lesson.
Taliesin: I look forward to giving the lesson, yes.
Liam: I'm curious if we could uh, it was Ermergerd, right?
Sam: My name?
Liam: Ermergerd Swearengen, yeah. (all laugh)
Sam: Nope. You misheard me, Little Elf Boy, it's Taryon Darrington.
Liam: Fucking don't like this guy. I'm curious, where do you hail from? Are you from here?
Sam: Nope, not from here. Matt, we discussed this, where am I from? (all laugh)
Sam: You gave me three options.
Matt: I did.
Sam: And I was like, "hmm, I don't know what any of those--"
Travis: Hey Tary! Open up!
Liam: Ooh.
Travis: Missile snaring!
Laura: Missile snaring!
Taliesin: Gloves of Missile Snaring are currently equipped, motherfucker!
Matt: Oh, shit! (all laugh)
Marisha: That's great.
Matt: That's beautiful. Okay. Let me go look up the information that I emailed you.
Sam: I can also look it up.
Liam: Who is that guy and what is email?
Laura: Yeah?
Taliesin: Doty's got email.
Matt: You are from the city of Diastock, in the Truscan Empire of Wildmount.
Sam: What he just said.
Laura: Wildmount! You're from Wildmount.
Taliesin: Wildmount, fine.
Marisha: He's from Dias-where?
Matt: Diastock.
Marisha: Diastock.
Matt: In the Truscan Empire
Marisha: Dia--
Liam: Stark.
Marisha: --stock.
Laura: Wildmount, hm?
Marisha: Truscan?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Have you been?
Laura: I haven't been no.
Liam: No we've not been.
Sam: It's quite lovely.
Liam: Yeah?
Sam: My family has quite a reputation there and I live on a vast compound with beautiful orchards and--
Marisha: Wait! You're not related to the Briarwoods, are you?
Sam: I'm sorry, no, I don't know them.
Taliesin: He doesn't look like a Briarwood.
Laura: No.
Marisha: Have you ever heard the name Briarwood before?
Sam: I have not, I'm sorry. Is Antlers okay over here?
Laura: She's quite all right.
Sam: All right. She seems a bit drunk already or something.
Laura: She always does.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: That's true. Especially these days.
Liam: Bring back the history lesson, though. So pampered, young, everything you could ever want--
Sam: I wouldn't say pampered. All right?
Liam: Those were my words. Go on.
Travis: Huggies.
Sam: I had a normal upbringing. Private tutors, classes--
Laura: Right, as you do.
Liam: Same. Same.
Laura: Right.
Sam: I wandered through the halls of our extensive library many nights. Read many books about adventure--
Travis: Yes, keep going.
Sam: -- exploration, magic, alchemy--
Liam: Is that code for masturbating?
Sam: I mean... you know.
Taliesin: Yes, yes it is.
Marisha: Kind of sounds like your upbringing, Percy.
Taliesin: Yes, it was code for masturbating. (all laugh)
Sam: My family runs a very prosperous business, and yes, I have received some benefits from that.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Sam: But I am a self-starter in my own mind and--
Laura: Oh God!
Taliesin: (yells)
Marisha: God!
Sam: I've gone out on my own to seek my fortune--
Travis: Oh God. The universe is collapsing.
Taliesin: We've lost Liam.
Sam: -- and record my exploits.
Laura: Did you purchase that armor all on your own as well, or did Mommy and Daddy buy it for you?
Sam: I purchased it myself. With my money, that--
Liam: Bequeathed to you.
Sam: -- that I can withdraw once a month. (all laugh)
Taliesin: It is quite lovely.
Sam: But it is mine.
Laura: That's good.
Sam: It belongs to me. It's my birthright.
Travis: Tary Jumbo, do you have a most dangerous conquest in that book? That Dotty has.
Sam: Doty. I have a list of adventures that I am currently going through.
Laura: (quietly) He's such an ass.
Sam: Some of the adventures include  Rescue a maiden--
Travis: Just any maiden?
Marisha: Oh jeez.
Sam: Transport a treasure. Escort a muckety-muck. A revenge plot. A classic dungeon crawl. Oh, this one I'm looking forward to! Solving a mysterious riddle.
Laura: Ooh!
Sam: The old fashioned double-cross. Teleport, haven't done that yet.
Laura: Really?
Sam: Shopping mission, but really I can wait on that one. (all laugh)
Sam: Slay a dragon. And there's more, but the list is extensive and I'd like to conquer various beasts, rescue different people, find different treasures. It's going to be quite an adventure.
Travis: Shopping is not what it's cracked up to be. You should just wipe it off the list right now.
Sam: Shopping?
Travis: While we're watching.
Sam: It's low on the list. It's a low one.
Travis: You can just erase it. You'll be fine.
Sam: All right, I will.
Laura: It's funny, that whole list... it seems like we've done all of it.
Marisha: I know.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Have you?
Travis: Several times.
Taliesin: Oh yes. How many dragons now?
Liam: Lost count.
Travis: Hard to count.
Laura: Five? Six? Something like that.
Sam: You haven't really, have you?
Liam: Yeah, we have.
Sam: An actual dragon?
Taliesin: Several of them.
Liam: Multiple dragons.
Laura: Ancient dragons
Travis: Dragons.
Sam: What was it like?
Laura: Deadly.
Marisha: Tary, do you feel like we look healthy and sane to you?
Sam: I mean--
Taliesin: Don't hold back.
Marisha: It's fine, you can be honest.
Sam: Healthy AND sane?
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: You seem healthy. You certainly are decked out in adventuring gear, which is quite attractive. Sanity I can't be a good judge of yet, I just met you. You seem like lovely creatures.
Liam: How old are you, exactly?
Sam: I'm a young 28.
Liam: You and I are the same age.
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: It's weird, you look older, but you act younger.
Sam: Oh, that is strange. Youthful exuberance, I suppose.
Laura: I suppose.
Sam: (hearty laugh)
Marisha: So, what do you hope to accomplish at the end of completing all these tasks, you know, slaying a dragon? What do you want in the other end?
Sam: The other end will be my masterpiece, my book. Doty has been very, very good about taking down all of my adventures and exploits, and at the end of it all... I know we just met, but may I share with you some of my working titles?
Travis: Please.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: Oh, please.
Laura: I would love to hear.
Travis: Hold on. Wait, one more!
Taliesin: Another round, I've got it, I've got it.
Matt: Treev's already on it. Treev is like, "Oh, don't worry. I'm loving this." Then he's just pouring all of you glasses and shoving them forward to you guys and crossing his arms.
Travis: Maybe some meats too, if you have any. Or cheeses.
Matt: We ain't got meat.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: I want to keep an eye-- I'm keeping an eye out for any kind of questionable behavior.
Matt: All right, perception check. Go ahead.
Laura: (quietly) God damn it.
Taliesin: That's a huge die you just rolled.
Laura: I know, right?
Travis: It's a newbie, it's a newbie.
Laura: 17.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Continue.
Travis: Which is why it screwed you.
Sam: Maybe you fellows could help me pick a title. Here's what I have so far.
Laura: I thought we already did, the Daring Adventures of--
Taliesin: We talked about it briefly.
Sam: That was a good one, but I have some other ones.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Tarry On with Taryon Darrington. The Terrific and Terrifying Tales of Daring Taryon Darrington--
Taliesin: That's pretty good.
Liam: That is all right.
Sam: Fifty Shades of Tary. (all laugh)
Sam: Bravado! The T. Darrington Story.
Laura: That one seems appropriate.
Sam: Zen and the Art of Robot Manservant Repair.
Liam: No. No. Thumbs down.
Sam: Adventuring for Dummies.
Taliesin: I feel like that's been done.
Sam: The Things They Tarried.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: The Blond Hair of Courage. (all laugh)
Sam: The Adventures of Huckle-Tary Finn. (all laugh)
Sam: The Odyssey.
Marisha: Oh.
Laura: Classic.
Travis: What? No!
Taliesin: Seen it.
Sam: Tary's Daring Do's and Daring Do-Nots. Dungeons and Darringtons.
Laura: Oh, wow.
Travis: Oh my god.
Sam: And this one just popped into my head Critical Patrol. (all laugh)
Liam: I grab my sister by the arm, and I drag her off the the side. What-- Why are we doing this exactly? Why are we bringing him with us, exactly?
Marisha: Keyleth just gets a nosebleed, and she's not sure why.
Laura: His money.
Liam: You think he can pay 50k an hour for realsies?
Laura: Hey, Tary.
Sam: Hm? Oi.
Laura: How much money do you have in your account right now?
Sam: In my account?
Laura: In your account.
Sam: I would not care to say. We're in a public place.
Laura: You can whisper it in my ear.
Sam: (whispers) I would not care to say.
Laura: Here's what I need to know. Are you full of shit and you don't actually have any money, or do you have enough to pay our fee?
Sam: Does this helmet look like it's something that didn't cost a shit ton of money?
Laura: It looks like it did, but for all I know you spent all your money on it.
Sam: All right, well, if you don't want the money, we can break the contract right now, and I'll go my way.
Laura: How about you just show me some money, and that way we can be sure.
Sam: All right, I will. Come with me over to the corner.
Laura: All right.
Travis: That's where the good stuff happens.
Taliesin: That was a nice little Jerry Maguire there, especially considering the date. Very appropriate.
Travis: Tavern corner.
Sam: Are we away from--?
Matt: You guys have stepped away from the rest of the crowd, as you guys watch--
Taliesin: I am watching this--
Marisha: Oh yeah.
Matt: Tary kind of puts his arm on her shoulder--
Laura: Don't touch me.
Matt: Leads her over to the corner.
Laura: Don't touch me.
Sam: I'll reach into my Bag of Holding
Travis: (gasps)
Sam: And pull up just a handful of coin.
Matt: A nice fistful of pristine platinum pieces in his grip.
Laura: Just a whole bag of that? I want to look at one.
Travis: Yeah, insight check that money.
Sam: Ding!
Laura: Don't. Flick. Money at me. Dear. If you want to keep your hands.
Sam: I'm sorry, Little--
Laura: Is this--?
Matt: You hear the scratching sound of quill on parchment as Doty has arrived behind you and is now currently cataloguing the entire conversation. (all laugh)
Laura: Does it look real?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Travis: Fucking roll high.
Laura: I'm gonna use my gold dice for this. It makes sense.
Liam: Oh, that was not good.
Laura: Ah, fuckin' A.
Taliesin: Yellow and black!
Travis: That's not the cup of a carpenter.
Laura: That's only 15.
Matt: Okay. You've seen quite a few gold, platinum pieces in your time. This seems fairly legit.
Laura: All right.
Matt: It seems like it's been minted recently, relative in the past maybe ten or so years. It has not seen a lot of antiquing across its surface, and most of the coin is branded in a way that emanates from the Truscan Empire. It does appear to have Wildmount origin.
Laura: Lovely. I believe you. Congratulations on being born into privilege.
Sam: Yes, well, I didn't choose to be, and I am trying to lead my life honest and true, humble and brave, every day of my life. And I thank you for allowing me to travel with you, and perhaps go on a mission? I mean, is this mission going to start at some point?
Laura: It was just completed, didn't you notice?
Sam: I'm sorry?
Laura: It happened right under your eyes. Mysterious, isn't it?  And I walk away.
Marisha: It's true, she's actually very correct.
Travis: Hey, Percy.
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: We're not near them, right?
Taliesin: No.
Travis: Hey, hey. Remember when we were at Greyskull Keep, and we made all the guards, like, audition to be guards?
Taliesin: Yes, that was quite a while ago.
Travis: What if we have an audition for Tary Jumbo?
Taliesin: It's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Travis: I love it when I do that, right?
Taliesin: I know, it's quite good. Let's finish up our business here.
Travis: We have business here?
Taliesin: Well, I think we should--
Marisha: Does anyone not understand, we had a mission here that we just completed?
Laura: We just did it! We completed it!
Marisha: We just did it!
Taliesin: We were also going to go to the Cerulean Tower and have a quick conversation.
Laura: Yeah, no. We need to do that.
Taliesin: We need to do that. But we did just finish a mission.
Marisha: Wait, J'mon?
Taliesin: Yes, we have to talk to--
Marisha: I am not taking him to J'mon.
Liam: That's probably wise.
Travis: You know, I can stand outside with him.
Marisha: We're like specially, you know, trained. And proven ourselves warriors. We got permission to see--
Travis: How about I audition him outside, while you go have your convo? Like, we make him beat somebody up or something.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Audition who? What are you talking about?
Travis: I'm saying we should, like, initiate Ole Tary J.
Taliesin: Like we did back at Greyskull.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: If that's what the letter that second word starts with.
Laura: (laughs) Yeah, right.
Marisha: You did good, Grog.
Laura: Impressive.
Travis: Yup.
Marisha: Good job.
Laura: I thought you only learned Gs.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Tary G.
Taliesin: Our business concluded, we actually have some business at the Cerulean Tower, so we should all, perhaps, head there at this point.
Sam: I... not to be a pest, but--
Taliesin: Too late, but yes?
Sam: I paid for adventure.
Taliesin: Oh, we're heading-- there will be adventure.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: You didn't actually pay for anything. You haven't paid.
Sam: I understand.
Liam: And we also didn't offer access to every contact and person that we know on this globe, all right?
Sam: Understood.
Liam: You're a tag-along.
Sam: And happy to be one.
Travis: Plus, these are several, subtle steps. We don't just chuck you in the furnace right away. We've got to temper you a bit.
Sam: Yeah. That makes total sense.
Travis: Cool.
Marisha: Besides, things just seem to happen around us.
Taliesin: Inevitably.
Marisha: So if you just hang out long enough, I'm sure someone's gonna want to beat our ass over something.
Laura: Like, most boring day ever now that Tary's here, we don't do anything fun at all.
Travis: Set up a craft fair.
Taliesin: Critical Craft Fair.
Laura: We all sit down and start knitting.
Travis: I will kill myself.
Marisha: Go to the post office. Check our P.O. box.
Laura: (laughs) Do some grocery shopping.
Taliesin: Laundry.
Liam: VM Accounting.
Taliesin: Magazines.
Matt: If only.
Taliesin: So, yes. We would love to head in that direction.
Travis: Yeah! Cinnamon Tower! (all laugh)
Taliesin: That sounds weird.
Marisha: I want to live in that world!
Taliesin: I would also like to, quietly on the headphone, I would really like to know where this machine comes from, because I'm finding it just a bit creepy, and I would love to get that information out of him before he disappears.
Travis: How tall is it again?
Matt: It's roughly eight and a half feet tall.
Travis: So just a bit taller than me?
Matt: A bit taller, yeah, I'd say a little larger than that.
Travis: A head and a half?
Matt: It's kind of hunched forward as it walks, it probably could stand taller if it wanted to.
Travis: Was he kind of like, Fassbender size-ish, or?
Matt: Not as broad.
Laura: Fassbender was bigger, right?
Travis: Okay.
Matt: It's tall, but it's kind of lanky in its construction, and it seems to be thicker at the feet and the arms and fists, but the actual structure itself is proportionally pretty thin.
Travis: Got it. It's Groot.
Liam: Hey, Percy...
Taliesin: Yes?
Liam: I faintly remember you talking about, you were talking to someone, I don't know who it was, but you were talking about plans you had for sort of a walking, automated something. Am I imagining that?
Taliesin: I dabbled... No, I talked about it. It always just seemed so impractical. And now I'm looking at one, and I'm irritated.
Liam: Yeah, I can see that.
Marisha: Irritated? Or was inferior the word you were looking for?
Taliesin: Vexed.
Marisha: Vexed, that's a good word.
Laura: It is a good word.
Travis: That's her name.
Liam: To be honest, you seem like you got your goolies burned there just from a conversation, a little bit.
Marisha: I know.
Taliesin: He didn't build this thing, and I'm worried about who did. He didn't build this thing.
Marisha: Percy,
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: Percy.
Liam: Well, you're the expert.
Taliesin: No. Yes. What?
Marisha: Look, you can turn this to your advantage. Brain drain him for all the knowledge you can!
Taliesin: I think we've already done that.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: I think that was an oyster we've already supped upon.
Marisha: I trust your judgement.
Taliesin: Ah yes, that got weird. I'm gonna flip on the cloak by the way, now that we are well out of that area.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Is anyone following us from the Scarbearers?
Matt: The eye that you have been keeping out, you don't notice anyone giving chase or following you.
Liam: Walking with Kelyeth. You know I don't know anything about that shit, but in my experience talent and skill have nothing to do with whether you're a douchenozzle or not. He seems like a schmuck.
Marisha: Oh, he's definitely a douchenozzle.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: (gasps) I think that's the first time I said douchenozzle.
Taliesin: I think it actually is.
Liam: He called you 'antlers'.
Marisha: Yeah he called you 'little elf-girl and little elf-boy'. I don't like him.
Liam: Mm.
Marisha: What's wrong with my antlers?
Liam: Nothing at all
Marisha: I know my hair's shorter so it makes my antlers look bigger, which I was concerned about.
Liam: No, they're very attractive I'm sure you heard---
Marisha: Is it okay?
Liam: Okay? It's your best feature.
Marisha: Thanks?
Laura: I like your face more than your antlers, but both are nice, dear.
Liam: No, definitely the antlers.
Marisha: All right, you know what? Let's move off this conversation.
Laura: I just wanted to ask Tary.
Sam: Oh, yes?
Laura: So your... Doty? Yes?
Marisha: Dottie.
Laura: Dottie, sorry.
Sam: Doty.
Liam: Duty.
Laura: Duty. Got it. Does he fight or does he just write?
Sam: He does what I tell him to do.
Laura: Is he competent in a battle?
Sam: I would say so.
Laura: Has he ever been in battle?
Sam: Doty has been in a battle.
Laura: Does he look like he has any battle scars?
Matt: Glancing over and getting a quick look-- make a perception check actually.
Laura: All right, just doing some--
Travis: Roll your new dice to redeem it for that shit--
Laura: (yells)
Travis: Should have done it.
Laura: No no no, at least it's not a one. 20.
Matt: Okay, glancing over and giving a once over of the giant mechanical creature (footsteps) walking a few feet behind you, you can see there are a lot of signs of repair. You can see there are a lot of places where bits of metal have been re-hammered. Elements have been patched over, and additional layers of armor have been added to it. You do see what appear to be some scrapes and areas where it has sustained various weapon attacks. That whole circumstance. It looks like it's seen some scuffles in it's time.
Laura: Duty looks... worn.
Sam: Doty.
Laura: Doty, my apologies. He looks worn. Old, far older than your armor.
Sam: That may be because in battle I am deft, fearless.
Travis: You're deaf?
Sam: No deft, with a T. I can dodge blows uncannily. I can anticipate what my opponent is going to do ahead of time and dodge out of the way.
Laura: I can see that about you.
Sam: Yes.
Laura: You seem very dexterous too.
Sam: I think I am.
Laura: Yes. Did Doty raise you? Is he like your nanny?
Sam: No, he's a mechanical construct that I made, he did not--
Laura: That you made when you were two? Because he looks like he raised you.
Sam: Doty did not raise me. He is a mechanical construct that I built when I learned how.
Liam: Does he cook?
Sam: He does not cook.
Liam: Does he clean?
Sam: He could clean. I---
Liam: Keep you warm at night?
Sam: No, he's cold as ice.
Laura: How old were you when you built him?
Sam: Well I'm 28 now.
Laura: Yes?
Sam: So that would have been 27.
Laura: He's a year old?
Sam: He's a year old.
Laura: And he only talks to you?
Sam: Nope. He doesn't talk to me.
Laura: Oh, he only listens to you.
Sam: He's the best really. Fearless, strong, big, and excellent penmanship. He's everything I could hope for in a friend. Silent.
Marisha: Were pen pals a thing for you? Is that why you like penmanship?
Sam: I mean, no. I don't think I ever had a penpal.
Marisha: No? Did you have any friends? Ever?
Liam: Or siblings?
Sam: I had tutors. I had the best teachers. I had--
Laura: Aww...
Marisha: Aww...
Sam: --wonderful. No, no! Don't 'aww'. They were wonderfully smart and engaging, but my best friends were the books I read.
Liam: What were Mom and Dad like?
Sam: They're still alive. There's no were. They are wonderful people my father--
Liam: I mean when you were a tyke.
Sam: (sighs) My father is a very talented businessman. He can be hard at times. He has great expectations for everyone he meets. My mother is... a saint; she's perfect in every way. She's a wonderful person and... yes.
Marisha: Really? And they're still alive? Weren't killed in some crazy raid, or... eaten by dragons or...fell in a pit of lava?
Sam: No, they are eagerly awaiting me to arrive back at home and tell them tales of my journeys and adventures.
Liam: What is your father's business?
Sam: He is a businessman.
Liam: A businessman? Is that a taboo subject with you?
Sam: No! Not at all. It's just, I'm not sure how well versed you are in financial transactions.
Liam: Oh, fuck-all. I thought you could give me the layman's terms.
Sam: He is in real estate. He buys and sells properties, charges rent, taxes...
Liam: A land baron.
Travis: So bored right now.
Sam: He owns a lot of things, places and makes a lot of money off of these places.
Liam: Interesting... Interesting.
Travis: Cinnamon Tower.
Sam: I will be forthcoming with anything that you ask me. I have nothing to hide. I come from money; this is clear.
Liam: Can I insight check him on 'I have nothing'?
Matt: Yeah, make an insight check.
Laura: Aw.
Liam: It's terrible, that's all right.
Laura: No, it's not! Don't use luck!
Liam: You shush!
Laura: You can--
Liam: I will use luck if I want to use luck!
Matt: Hard to read. For many reasons!
Liam: I'll say!
Taliesin: I also want to take a good long look at robot and see if I can-- this automaton.
Matt: Okay. Investigation check.
Taliesin: Come on. (sighs) Okay, 13.
Matt: What are you trying to ascertain about it?
Taliesin: How old it is, how it was built, where it was built. Just to get a sense of it, like looking over a classic car.
Matt: Best that you can tell from its construction and your understanding, there is a lot of ingenuity in its design. But it is, it exists, and moves through a combination of decent engineering and enchantment.
Taliesin: Oh thank God! Okay, I feel better.
Matt: You can see very, very faint engravings of various runic glyphs that are similar some of the ones that you saw on--
Taliesin: Fassbender?
Matt: -- Fassbender.
Taliesin: All right. I feel better already, thank you. Ego restored.
Liam: (sings the Legend of Zelda 'item' tune)
Matt: You guys make your way to the Sand Herald District and there you can see the distant towers of the Cerulean Place. The large central one that leads up into the chamber of J'mon Sa Ord. As you approach the outside, you see the familiar faces and armor of the Hands of Ord there, guarding the exterior of the palace walls. As you approach, one of the guards steps up with their same kind of brass and sapphire emblazoned armor, and one of them approaches and steps forward. "I'm sorry. Do you have business at the palace?"
Laura: Yes. Question  the symbol? Scanlan?
Liam: Scanlan had it...
Laura: That's what I thought.
Travis: Oh, fucking shit.
Marisha: I thought we got it back, though.
Laura: Did he give back to us or did he not?
Marisha: Wait, no. Are we talking about the flute?
Liam: No, there was a symbol.
Laura: Remember the symbol that had--
Liam: J'mon's symbol to show to all friends.
Taliesin: I think he still has the symbol, doesn't he?
Marisha: I have his flute because I picked it up last.
Laura: Yeah, that doesn't have his symbol on it though.
Liam: That's not the same thing.
Taliesin: We do bring news though, so...
Marisha: Fuck!
Liam: We are friends to-- the man on top. J'mon, I misspoke.
Laura: J'mon Sa Ord.
Marisha: We need to speak with him.
Liam: Vox Machina is here, he knows us.
Marisha: And return this  I show the flute. Maybe they'll recognize it?
Matt: The guard takes the flute and--
Marisha: I take it and I dust the ash and drug use off of it. And then--
Matt: The guard takes it and looks at it, confused. "Please to be patient, for just a moment."
Laura: Of course, be pleased!
Matt: "Be pleased." Turns around and walks back up the stairs, the front of the palace, and enters through one of the side doorways. About two, three minutes pass. The guards just keep a view out, and then eventually you see an older woman in familiar ceremonial robes exit from the doorway that the guard went into. This is the Grand Maven, Gameshega, who you met and escorted you up into the palace originally. She walks up with her bracelets still jingling as she steps down the stairs, her long robes trailing behind her a good like two-three feet. Her headdress still has little brass quills that streak down, past her shoulders into her mid-back, and as she steps up: "It is good to see all of you once more. I do not believe we have met, I'm sorry, what is your name?"
Sam: Taryon Darrington. Nice to meet you. Be pleased.
Matt: Taryon Darrington, friend of Vox Machina, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. So J'mon would like to extend their greetings to all of you, and respect in the wake of the news of the destruction of the Conclave. You've aided in closing a far too lingering chapter in the history of Marquet and the ruin of the Cinder King. Thank you.
Sam: You're welcome.
Taliesin: We wanted to make sure that they were aware that all of the dragons had been dealt with, and that the Conclave had been completely vanquished.
Matt: This information did make it to the ears of J'mon.
Taliesin: Excellent. And we thank you for your time.
Matt: Of course. Anything else?
Laura: Um.
Marisha: I guess not?
Laura: Well, could I take you aside for a moment?
Matt: "Of course, my dear." And she walks alongside you as you pull her off a little bit.
Laura: We have in our service, in Emon, a wonderful man, who has been of great aid in battling the Conclave as well, and we learned recently that he was expelled from Marquet due to crimes in his youth and was wondering if we could maybe speak in his name and his regard, to you, to clear his name?
Matt: I can see what I can do. What is the name of this gentleman?
Laura: Jarett. His last name?
Liam: Serpersveshzhg?
Sam: Anderson?
Marisha: Howarth.
Laura: Jarett...
Marisha: Howarth. Howarth.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: Jarett Howorth?
Marisha: Howarth.
Laura: Jarett Howarth.
Sam: You have his name?
Laura: Of course she does, because she takes killer notes.
Sam: Holy Bajoly!
Taliesin: She writes everything down.
Sam: I didn't know that he had a name!
Matt: Jarrett Howarth.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay. I will go and take this into the archives, discover and see what can be done.
Laura: Thank you so much. If you find out anything, will you please send word?
Matt: Yes, should we be sending it to Emon as well?
Laura: If you could, send it to Whitestone?
Matt: To Whitestone?
Laura: That would be wonderful.
Matt: Okay. Very well. We have not sent anything to Whitestone before. We will find a way to do so.
Laura: It's an up and coming city. Very prominent on Tal'dorei.
Taliesin: It's on the move.
Laura: It's on the move.
Liam: Would you send J'mon, would you send them our thanks?
Matt: I will do this. I apologize, J'mon is not currently taking audiences.
Laura: Totally fine.
Matt: But I will continue to pass this word onto them.
Laura: Thank you so much.
Matt: Thank you very much. And good day! Be pleased.
Laura: Be pleased.
Travis: Beep-beep!
Matt: As the Grand Maven turns around and heads back up the stairs, the guards take their place and the palace is at rest.
Laura: Welp.
Travis: He must be sick.
Laura: Probably.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: The flu, perhaps.
Marisha: It's been going around.
Laura: Lots of travel happening. Happens when you travel, I hear.
Marisha: It's true, yeah. Anytime you fly.
Taliesin: So I think that concludes this little jaunt, it might be back home now.
Laura: Oh jeez.
Travis: Well, I think it's about time that we see what Tary Jumbo's worth.
Sam: I'm sorry?
Travis: One of your things on your list, right, it was to get in a kerfuffle?
Sam: There's no kerfuffle on the list--
Travis: Riff-ram, bah-zhu.
Sam: --but we are going to have an adventure, is that right?
Laura: So many.
Sam: At some point?
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Laura: All of them.
Liam: Buddy boy, you're buying in for shit you're not really ready for, yes.
Sam: All right.
Travis: We gotta know how--
Sam: So far, we've delivered a dead body part to someone, and had a brief conversation with a guard.
Taliesin: It's only been two hours.
Sam: Is this what you all are about?
Liam: We're gonna take a little time for a day. And then we're gonna take you to hell.
Sam: All right.
Liam: How does that sound?
Sam: Are you speaking metaphorically?
Travis: No, no, literally hell.
Taliesin: No, we're going to hell.
Travis: There's like seven or eleven of them.
Sam: All right.
Liam: Wow.
Travis: Are those together? Close?
Laura: Very big numbers, Grog.
Liam: Sure.
Taliesin: We're taking this one to hell then?
Marisha: Might be a good trial run.
Liam: I don't know. Do you want to put him through his paces?
Travis: Yeah, I think so.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: I want to save traveling the Ozmit Sea and heading to the water Ashari for when Pike is back.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: So, yeah.
Liam: Yeah. Let's take this fucker to hell.
Sam: I don't know what you're talking about.
Marisha: No, we're speaking insanely literally right now. That's what's impressive about it.
Sam: I...
Liam: We are going to Hell.
Sam: All right.
Liam: And you are coming along.
Marisha: And we're taking you with us.
Laura: Shouldn't we see him fight first?
Liam: Yeah, well, let's bring him home.
Laura: I'd hate for him to die immediately.
Liam: Yeah, we want Grog to run him out like a labrador.
Travis: Do I see any large, intimidating looking creatures just walking around where we are at the moment?
Laura: No, not in the city, Grog.
Travis: I'm not talking to you.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: He only has to listen to you at home.
Laura: I know.
Travis: 12.
Matt: Uh, best that you can tell here in the Sand Herald district, no. Most everyone who wanders around here are of noble dress or part of the Hand of Ord.
Travis: You see that fruit merchant over there?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Killed many, many people.
Sam: Oh, well maybe I should pay him to take me on an adventure because Jesus Christ. This is about as fucking boring as I can get.
Travis: I might just hit him. I might just attack him.
Laura: Hey! You know what you can cross off your list? Teleportation, because that's what we're about to do.
Sam: No, really?
Laura: Oh yeah.
Marisha: It's true.
Sam: It's on my list; it's literally on my list.
Laura: I know.
Marisha: Wait what? All right, let's go.
Sam: All right, all right, all right! Finally getting my money's worth.
Marisha: So we're going back to Whitestone?
Taliesin: Yes, Whitestone.
Liam: Yes, get your big boy pants on, Ermergerd.
Sam: It's Taryon!
Marisha: Come on, Doodee.
Sam: Doty.
Matt: All right, as you find a familiar tree you can utilize to transport over to Whitestone, Tary you watch as the center of this tree's trunk suddenly seems to split open with divine energy.
Sam: Cool.
Matt: On the opposite side, you watch this tunnel progress about four or five feet within where it just looks like the striations of the interior of the tree trunk before it emerges on the other side into another town square currently in the middle of an evening.
Sam: Doty, take this down. As the tree split in front of me--
Taliesin: I shove him through.
Sam: Ahhh!
Marisha: You have six seconds!
Matt: As you all tumble through the Transport via Plants spell, you all emerge on the opposite side of the Sun Tree in the center of Whitestone's courtyard. What do you wish to do?
Sam: Oh my. Oh my gods. Where are we? What's going on?  What happened? Where am I? Is this a fantasy world? What happened?
Marisha: Are you feeling nauseous?
Liam: Whack!
Sam: Ahh!
Taliesin: How about now?
Sam: Wow! That was exhilarating! It's like my body fell apart and came back together again!
Laura: That's exactly what it was like.
Sam: It was amazing!
Liam: I've never had that.
Laura: Or it was like walking forward.
Liam: Yeah. I've never had that sensation ever before. Ever.
Sam: I felt a great force behind me, pushing me forward! And then all of a sudden I opened my eyes and was in a new place. Doty, take this down. Today is the greatest day of Taryon Darrington's life. The day that he experienced the wonder of the gods. That's enough for now.
Marisha: Oh my god, did you guys hear that? He thinks I'm a god. Doucher!
Travis: Douchenozzle.
Marisha: Douchenozzle, that's right! That's what it was. Sorry, I'm just learning it.
Laura: What time is it here?
Matt: Technically now that I think about it, it would still be day, because you guys left in the morning to Ank'Harel, and you've been there for a few hours, so it's early afternoon at this point.
Laura: Okay. Oh, fabulous. All right.
Travis: So we're back on home turf, right?
Liam: Yeah, we're going to take this guy to a field and kick his ass, or what are we going to do?
Travis: Yeah, I kind of want to.
Laura: Oh, can I go find Jarett really fast?
Matt: Yeah, it's easy enough to find. You head down to where the makeshift garrison, which has now seen reconstruction, actually being turned into a decent functional garrison within the town itself. A lot of the guards are out there running through their drills for the afternoon, and you can see Jarrett is in the process of running them through what looks like ranged combat training. As you approach, Jarett looks over and watches you walking up from a distance and kind of gives a wave, "Hello!"
Laura: Hi.
Matt: "So, everything seems to be in order here. I have to say, I am very glad to know that we have no more dragons for quite some time." And you see he's recovering; he's healing, but there is noticeable scarring on the side of his neck. And it looks like he's going through the process of recovering from the Thordak battle, but he's doing much better than the last time you saw him.
Laura: How are you mentally?
Matt: To be perfectly honest, very happy to not be anywhere near that terrible city. I never thought I had the sense for the slower parts of the countryside, but I don't know; I've come to like it here in Whitestone.
Laura: It is quite nice. Well, you're welcome to stay.
Matt: Well, I was intending to.
Laura: We are planning to rebuild our home in Emon as well.
Matt: Yes, yes.
Laura: So it's up to you where you'd like to be.
Matt: Really, you employ me so it is more up to you, but I kind of like the change in temperature.
Laura: I do too.
Matt: Bit chillier up here, north.
Laura: Well, in case you're wondering, we just came from Marquet.
Matt: Oh?
Laura: Where we spoke with the Grand Maven?
Matt: Right?
Laura: Of J'mon Sa Ord. Spoke very highly of you and she's working on getting your name cleared.
Matt: Really?
Laura: Well, she said she would. I don't know what you did, dear, but hopefully it wasn't anything too terrible.
Liam: Serial killer.
Matt: He doesn't look nervous at all, he looks elated and is like, "Well, thank you. I hope that comes to a fruitful end. I've been living here long enough where it's not a huge deal to me, but it would be nice to occasionally return--"
Laura: See home?
Matt: Yeah. You know.
Laura: That's nice.
Matt: Thank you, I appreciate that.
Laura: Of course. And you may not have heard, but our resident bard has left us. Possibly for the time being, possibly for more. So you won't be seeing his face around here.
Matt: I am sorry to hear that.
Laura: I only tell you because I saw you speaking with him several times and thought you might want to know.
Matt: This is good to know. Well, I look forward to his return. That being the case, can I ask a favor of you?
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "Could you hold this?" And he reaches back and pulls out a small pouch and puts it in your hand. "I don't feel comfortable holding on to this."
Laura: What is it?
Matt: It was requested by your small bard friend and I probably should not have it on my person.
Laura: Requested?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: What is it? Components of a potion? I don't...
Matt: One that you should not probably drink.
Laura: What is it, Jarrett?
Matt: It's suude. It's illegal. You should not-- It is dangerous.
Laura: It's drugs?
Matt: Yes! Yes it is! Let's talk about it in front of everyone I'm training! Yes, thank you!
Laura: I put it in my pocket.
Matt: Don't do drugs!
Laura: Don't do drugs! Scanlan was doing drugs? Jarett, you sold Scanlan drugs?
Matt: No, I procured them for him at his request.
Laura: Is this why you were expelled from Marquet?
Matt: (unconvincingly) No. (all laugh)
Matt: There are a number of reasons.
Laura: How long have you been providing this to him?
Matt: This was only the second. I did not want to do this! He is a very convincing person and looked like he was going through a hard time.
Laura: Yes, he is.
Matt: And look, I understand that, and I warned him. He knew full well the dangers involved; he's a much stronger man than I am. Who was I to tell him this? And he's very persuasive.
Laura: He is. When was the first time you gave it to him?
Matt: Not more than maybe a week or two ago?
Laura: Thank you. Thank you for giving them to me.
Matt: Yes, it was burning a hole in my pocket. And I don't want to hold onto it.
Laura: I understand.
Matt: Sorry.
Laura: I appreciate your service, Jarrett.
Matt: I appreciate your understanding.
Laura: Get better. Keep training.
Matt: Yes, I should do that.
Laura: All right.
Matt: He turns around, "You lot heard nothing! Nock your crossbows, nock--" (whack) and slaps one guy on the back of the head. "All right. Focus up, on the targets," and you hear him begin taking a few volleys off in the distance as you walk your way back to the castle. The rest of you, as you walk through Whitestone, Taryon, you watch this beautiful, wonderfully slightly backwards city--
Taliesin: Hey! Okay...
Sam: It's amazing.
Matt: It's charming.
Sam: Yes, quaint really.
Matt: Yeah! And there's a castle. They have a castle!
Sam: Tourists must love it here.
Taliesin: We do quite well... in the on season.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah. In years ago.
Travis: Do you mind if you come to the outskirts of the city with us?
Sam: I literally know nothing about this city.
Travis: Great, yeah, come with us. Just Vax knows the way, Vax will you... You know? The spot?
Liam: The beautiful parts of the city, actually, are the countryside, the woods around. It's drab in the middle.
Sam: I paid for adventure.
Travis: Yeah, it's out there.
Liam: And adventure you shall have, my friend.
Sam: All right.
Travis: So can we find our way to like a fairly open and not populated part of Whitestone?
Matt: Yeah. Your best bet, at this point, would be to make your way to the unclaimed gardens in the back of the castle.
Taliesin: I was going to say.
Marisha: Castle courtyards.
Matt: For awhile there was no greenery back there. The processing and disposing of the excess acids lead to the green fume that was billowing behind the castle when you first arrived here and destroyed most of the plant life. Through your aid and the people who kept the castle, those have been filled in and it looks like the castle grounds are starting to recover. There is now a fresh growing season of green back there, and that is closed off. It is protected. There are guards around and it is away from the general populace of Whitestone.
Travis: Nice. This looks like a great place. Now, if you want your first taste of adventure, you need to bring Dottie and come over here.
Sam: Doty.
Travis: I have to whisper it because it's very secret.
Sam: Four-eyes, shall I trust Jumbo here because he seems a bit shady.
Taliesin: Yes, no, you should trust him with your life. He's very trustworthy.
Sam: I will roll an insight check.
Liam: Grog and I are just waiting.
Sam: What do I add to it?
Matt: Your insight skill.
Sam: Oh yeah, that. I have forgotten how to play Dungeons and Dragons. 18.
Matt: Travis, I would like you to roll a deception.
Taliesin: Wait, is it Travis or is it me?
Laura: Is it deception?
Matt: Oh wait, no, it's from you, sorry. Yeah, this is Percival, technically.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Matt: It's kind of both of you.
Travis: Bitch! I rolled a 17.
Liam: So Percy at advantage then, right?
Marisha: You can trust Grog for some things.
Laura: You can!
Sam: Go on!
Travis: Plus I do want to take him on an adventure.
Laura: I feel like Grog is getting far more trustworthy.
Marisha: I agree!
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: You get the sense that maybe not all the information is there.
Taliesin: It's not a lie.
Matt: It's not a lie, but it's definitely-- it speaks of a half truth.
Sam: What's going on out here?
Travis: Secret stuff. Are you ready?
Sam: For what?
Travis: Where's Dottie?
Sam: Doty. He's right behind me, as he always is.
Travis: Nice. So put out your hand like this.
Sam: What's going to happen?
Travis: And take your other hand, and you either make a boulder, a piece of paper, or a pair of shears. Right? And we do it on three.
Taliesin: To be perfectly honest, I'm not entirely sure what's happening either.
Marisha: You've never played Boulder, Paper, Shears?! (all laugh)
Sam: That's the best thing you've ever said, Marisha.
Taliesin: That just went right up my nose. It burns. That is not pleasant.
Sam: Of course I've played Boulder, Paper, Shears.
Travis: Great, great. It's just to see who goes first. Ready?
Sam: One, two, three--
Travis: And on the third one, I cast enlarge with the Titanstone Knuckles,
Liam: And I sneak attack Ermergerd.
Travis: And I smack Doty. (all laugh)
Sam: Fuck, I'm dead.
Liam: Pommel side, pommel side! I'm gonna Kynan him.
Matt: Okay, and you're going after Doty.
Travis: Yup.
Matt: With just your hands?
Travis: Yeah, just a backhand.
Matt: Okay, both you guys roll attack.
Laura: Oh my gosh!
Taliesin: Boulder, Paper, Shears-- Boulder, Parchment, Shears.
Marisha: Boulder, Parchment, Shears.
Travis: 24.
Liam: Natural 20!
Laura: Why do you want a natural 20?! You're going to kill him!
Taliesin: No, no.
Liam: Not with the pommel side, man!
Matt: Okay, go ahead and do your sneak attack damage.
Marisha: Non-lethal.
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: And double it cause you rolled a natural 20. You, go ahead and roll for the backhand, it's one--
Sam: I will be dead.
Travis: It's four, right?
Matt: It's just a backhand. I would say it's one damage plus your strength modifier.
Taliesin: "Vax, where'd you get that amazing armor?"
Travis: Eight, so nine?
Matt: Okay, so nine damage.
Travis: My strength modifier is eight.
Matt: Yeah, so it'd be nine.
Sam: Doty is going to use his reaction to attack Vax.
Matt: Okay, yes.
Sam: Right? Because when attacked within five feet of me, he gets to react?
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: What?!
Sam: To defend me? Or to attack?
Matt: To attack the person who attacked you.
Travis: See, this is a real good way to figure shit out.
Taliesin: I'm already excited by this.
Laura: This is true! This is smart.
Travis: Thanks.
Laura: You're so smart!
Matt: After this round, actually, for the tension basis of this and for the arrangement for the circumstance, I'm going to take a break, and then come back to this, so we can give this the real feel you want to. So after this round. All right, so after-- Okay, so you do seven damage, you backhand Doty (impact sound)--
Travis: Nine! Nine damage, yeah.
Matt: -- and the head turns to the side. The tome falls to the ground, open on the ground so the pages fold a little bit, and the metallic creature (shifting metal) back to you, stands up, and now goes a full six inches taller than you, and then rears back with its fist, and right as it's about to swing, it sees from behind Vax creep up and hit-- how much damage?
Liam: 86.
Matt: 86 points of damage.
Sam: 86 to me?
Taliesin: What?!
Liam: Yes.
Sam: Great. Great.
Travis: Plus I'm enlarged, so I am probably taller than Doty now.
Matt: Actually, that's right, yeah, so even at your enlarged height, you're still probably a good foot and a half, two feet larger than Doty.
Travis: Let's say I hit him, he looks back, and he's looking at my nipples.
Laura: Oh, that's cool.
Matt: Yeah, there you go. As you're growing (robotic motion noises)--
Travis: What happened?
Matt: Goes to punch towards you, however out of the corner of Doty's eye, sees this half-elf show up and whack him right square in the center of the neck and spinal column and then the fist just goes wide and slams toward you. That is going to be a 23 to hit.
Liam: Hits.
Matt: You suffer... Ooh! 16 points of bludgeoning damage.
Laura: Ooh!
Matt: As the giant iron fist of Doty just (whack) clangs into the back of your head and part of your ear and you feel the ringing in your skull from the impact.
Liam: Mm-hm.
Matt: You, Taryon, fall to your knees--
Sam: (pained grunt)
Matt: -- and find a large portion of your vitality and breath and just general awareness knocked out of you from from one singular blow from nowhere. Your eyes go white for a second--
Sam: This is the sound that I make. (high pitched goat-like yelps) (all laugh)
Travis: That's a wuss panic.
Sam: Do I get a shot?
Matt: That was the surprise round, because you were not aware of this circumstance. We're going to continue combat after this break. (cheers and laughter)
Marisha: I'm getting in on this!
Liam: It was his idea!
Matt: Oh yeah. Just so you're aware, everyone who's watching, you just watched your boyfriend cold-cock an innocent person.
Marisha: I watched him walk up behind him and do it. I knew what he was doing.
Matt: All right, just so you're aware. All right guys--
Marisha: This is a part of our Vox Machina hazing. This is what we do!
Matt: This is pretty fucked up, you guys. (all laugh)
Taliesin: So fucked up!
Matt: All right, we'll come back in a few minutes after we take a quick break to continue this combat. We'll see you here shortly. [BREAK]
Matt: Hello everyone and welcome back to Critical Role. So, last we left off, in the middle of the Whitestone courtyard, two members of Vox Machina decided, as part of the hazing process, to assault our new temporary party member.
Taliesin: (laughs) When you put it like that.
Travis: How about test?
Liam: This is literally the third time we have done this.
Matt: I know! I'm not surprised by any of you. It's just-- Oh no, I am surprised, I wasn't expecting it, but it makes sense.
Marisha: Wow, it sounds like us last week.
Matt: Yeah, exactly.
Laura: Hey!
Travis: Or every week.
Matt: That being the case, anyone who cares to get involved in this, I need you to roll initiative.
Taliesin: In.
Marisha: In.
Laura: Am I there?
Sam: Wait, you guys are all doing this to me?
Taliesin: No, I want to be in initiative just to make sure that I can actually make sure that--
Marisha: I want to make decisions.
Matt: Would you have gone with him, or would you have stayed back?
Laura: Well, I was coming from talking to Jarrett so, it's up to you if I'm there yet.
Matt: So yeah, you wouldn't be there actually, yeah.
Laura: Am I walking up as it's happening?
Matt: You will be walking up towards the castle.
Liam: This was a--
Travis: Yeah, this was a Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
Liam: -- Grog whispering to Vax thing, on a walk.
Matt: So. There is no Percival, no Keyleth in, but you guys were--
Taliesin: Oh, I'm in!
Marisha: No, I'm in.
Matt: Okay. Percival's in, yeah, they're there.
Liam: Yeah, we're not trying try to ditch them. I'm just saying. It wasn't an announced thing.
Matt: Yeah, so Vex is the only one who's not there. Okay, so, for those who are present and wish to be part of this: roll initiative. What have we got? So we have...
Sam: Eight.
Travis: (laughs)
Sam: (choking noise)
Taliesin: 25.
Sam: You shouldn't bother. It's over!
Marisha: 16.
Liam: (choking noise) Big 11.
Travis: 18.
Matt: Okay, Percival, you're up first. As you watch Grog backhand this mechanical entity in the face, while Vax appears from the shadows and just beans the back of Taryon across the center of the neck and spinal column--
Sam: (muffled scream)
Matt: -- and he falls to his knee making this horrible, horrible sound.
Liam: (laughs) That's my friend.
Taliesin: Come on man, pick it up, pick it up! I just draw my sword and stand on the sidelines, preparing for whatever is about to happen.
Sam: (gasping for breath)
Matt: Okay. Grog.
Travis: Did Doty go down or-- no, he just stood there looking at me afterwards, right?
Matt: Yeah. Doty just (twang), and looked back at you slowly.
Travis: Right. Where is--
Matt: Unblinking mechanical face.
Travis: Where is Tary Jumbo?
Matt: Right here, about five feet from you.
Travis: I look at him.
Sam: (whimpers)
Travis: I hold up my hand and say  Show me what you have learned (all laugh)
Matt: That's all you do?
Travis: That's it.
Matt: Okay, that's Grog's turn. Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay, first and foremost I'm going to create a windwall, around us, like an arena.
Matt: Like an arena.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: (wind swirling) And then I'm gonna--
Matt: Suddenly, the wind kicks up around (heavy wind). The leaves and various fallen parts of the greenery around here kick up into this torrent around you, as the wind is now creating a barrier around the battlefield.
Marisha: Yeah, I turn to Percy and I say  man, you know, I almost feel bad for the guy.
Sam: (gasps loudly)
Taliesin: Give him a boost.
Marisha: Should I give him a boost?
Taliesin: Give him a boost.
Marisha: Should we give him an incentive?
Taliesin: Nah.
Marisha: All right, we'll start with a boost. And I give him a healing word.
Matt: Okay, what level?
Marisha: We'll give him a level two.
Matt: Level two, all right. 2d4 plus six.
Marisha: I guess you're worth it. Oh, you got real lucky Tary. I got a four and a three, which adds to be seven. Plus...
Matt: Plus six for your Wisdom, so it's 13.
Marisha: 13 points. And then I say  come on, Tary!
Sam: (high-pitched) What? Who said that? Why is the wind blowing?
Matt: Vax, what are you doing? (all laugh)
Liam: I bring my hand around the back of his head, and I'm gonna use my action to cast Lay on Hands and dump all 15 hit points into the back of his head. Then I'm going to use Disengage and hop back away from him and say-- Oh, no! Before I hop back and say: we are a bunch of fucking assholes and this is all you are going to get with us. Are you sure? And then use Disengage to roll back.
Matt: All right. And you move back away from him?
Liam: Yeah, but I have my movement plus-- Yes, back.
Matt: How far?
Liam: 30 feet.
Matt: 30 feet.
Matt: All righty. Yep, okay. That ends your turn. Taryon. What do you wish to do?
Travis: First time.
Sam: Hands shaking, body quivering, blood everywhere. (all laugh)
Liam: No, no, no--
Matt: No, out of the nose.
Liam: You have a massive headache.
Matt: You did 88 damage to him from behind with the back of your dagger. There is blood out of his nose, out of his ears.
Liam: I just wanted to get him to unconscious. If I'm not a master assassin--
Laura: Nope.
Liam: How can I not go (thu-kunk) and not--
Marisha: You at least split his head.
Travis: He has weak capillaries.
Matt: Understand, you critically hit him from behind to do 88 points of damage.
Liam: Right.
Matt: That would have killed a regular human being.
Liam: Right, right.
Matt: Or at least have put them in a-- He's not like, bleeding out.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: But he looks rough. (all laugh)
Liam: Did I make it clear that I was trying to do this to Sam and not Tary? (all laugh)
Matt: No. Sam, what are you doing?
Sam: I-- I, shit, well Grog gets an attack, but I'm going to--
Matt: Actually, Grog is not directly in a melee with you, so Grog does not.
Sam: Oh, I'm going to counter clockwise around Doty, all the way round.
Matt: All the way around to here?
Sam: Yeah, yeah. All the way round, yeah. So I'm facing Grog and the others, in a sort of a cone pattern. And I fumble, I'm fumbling on the helmet, trying to find the right gem to pull out. And I pull out a diamond. And I pluck it out of the helmet and I go (screams). And I will cast Prismatic Spray.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Laura: Oh shit!
Matt: So just past Doty, (whoosh), as a familiar, and previously prevented, blast of rainbow arcane energy comes shooting forth from Taryon's hand. Hitting Grog, Keyleth and Percival.
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: I need you all to make a dexterity saving throw.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Awesome.
Taliesin: I get advantage on that.
Matt: You do, because of your cloak.
Taliesin: It's a-- What saving throw? I'm so sorry.
Matt: What's the DC on that?
Sam: Oh! On me?
Matt: Yes, on the helmet.
Sam: The helm is 18.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 13.
Marisha: 23.
Sam: Wow.
Taliesin: 20.
Sam: Wow, guys.
Matt: Okay, so. Both of you guys halve the damage. Grog does not.
Travis: Gimme what you got.
Liam: Show me what you got!
Marisha: Show me what you got!
Taliesin: I'm going to use my reaction to swallow part of the spell, so I'm going to take half damage of his half damage.
Matt: Okay, got you. I'm going to go ahead and do this.
Marisha: Can you do the chargey thing?
Taliesin: Mm-hm. But I'm fully charged.
Marisha: Oh, that's cool. That's cool.
Taliesin: I can use this as long as I have a reaction.
Marisha: Right.
Sam: Do I roll? Do you roll?
Matt: Actually, you get to roll. If you want to. So it's 10d6 damage.
Sam: Maybe you should roll.
Matt: Okay, I did roll for that one.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Matt: Just in case, so--
Sam: 10d6 what damage?
Matt: I'm gonna figure that out here in just a minute.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm so excited.
Matt: 41 damage, however, against you, Percy.
Marisha: If you've vaporized me, I'm going to be real pissed.
Matt: That is 41 points of poison damage to you.
Taliesin: Halved.
Matt: Reduced to 20, reduced to ten.
Taliesin: To ten.
Matt: And your charges are still full, regardless.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Keyleth.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You take 41 points of fire damage, halved to 20. So, 20 points of fire damage as the red beam hits you and the flames just burn across. The front of your hair blown back from the blast of the heat. Percival, you feel the sickly ray of the poison splatter past and cover your skin with this semi-translucent poisonous liquid. Grog, you take 41 points of cold damage.
Travis: I have resistance, with my new exalted knuckles.
Matt: You do. So, you take 20 points of cold damage from that.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: So, the beam subsides and you see them all blasted with it, but they're still standing.
Sam: (gasps)
Matt: Perturbed by it.
Sam: How are they still alive? (all laugh)
Matt: And Doty's at the ready, (metal hitting metal) What do you want Doty to do?
Marisha: New kid's got game.
Sam: Well, first of all, as my bonus action, I will cast Sanctuary on myself.
Marisha: What the fuck is that?
Travis: What is that?
Sam: It protects me from things. (all laugh)
Sam: Like a lot.
Travis: We'll see.
Matt: (laughing) Yeah, I love it.
Travis: That's a new one right? We haven't come up against that before.
Sam: They're all new, friend.
Matt: All right, so Sanctuary on you, and what do you want to tell Doty to do?
Sam: Doty, I will say, (gasping for breath) Doty, save me... Save me! Hit the big guy!
Matt: (metal grinding and a heavy force swinging) And is going to go in for ... The giant fist hit towards you. That is going to be a 17 to hit. What's your AC?
Travis: That is my AC.
Matt: All right, that hits. And then, after the fist comes back and smacks you in the face, across the jaw, for nine plus five-- 14 points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Beautiful.
Matt: The hand grabs the front your clavicle, pulls back, and attempts to headbutt you. That's a natural 20.
Liam: Ooh.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Travis: Nice. I love it.
Marisha: Yeah? Yeah.
Matt: That is 14-- That is 19 points of bludgeoning damage. So, halved to nine.
Liam: That's terrible.
Travis: I'm not raging.
Matt: That's right! So--
Travis: 19 points of bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Yeah, so 19 points of bludgeoning damage. As Doty just (clang) slams you right in the middle of the face. You feel the nose kinda (cracking noise) from the break, and the blood getting gushed from your nostrils. From the headbutt.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: All right, that ends Doty's turn. Sanctuary's on you. Next up, top of the round, Percival.
Taliesin: Mm.
Marisha: Yeah, that Prismatic Spray was impressive.
Taliesin: That was very impressive, yes.
Marisha: What are you gonna do?
Taliesin: I don't know. I think I'm just gonna enjoy watching this for a minute.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm gonna hold my attack. Until he pulls out another object. Of any kind.
Matt: Okay, so you're holding until he fiddles with an object.
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: Okay. That brings it to Grog.
Travis: Right. That was a pretty good hit, and now I'm angry. And I rage.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'm dead.
Matt: Bonus action, rage.
Travis: And I walk up so I am within melee-- Actually, I'll go opposite... yeah, on the other side of Tary from Doty.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I don't attack of opportunity, do I?
Travis: No, no, I wanna be on Tary, opposite of--
Matt: You weren't in combat with him.
Sam: Got it.
Travis: Yeah, no, I wanna be-- I wanna put Tary between me and the big robot.
Matt: Oh I see. So you go this way.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. Great. I will say Doty does get an attack of opportunity on you.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: As you pull out of the way. That is a nine. That does not hit you.
Travis: Nope.
Matt: (whoosh) Just too slow, and too wide as the rage kinda instills you with adrenaline, and you dodge past.
Sam: Dammit, Doty, do better!
Matt: All right.
Travis: And as I look down, dribbling out of my mouth, I say, Is that it? And that's my turn.
Laura: Oh, God.
Sam: What? You're not gonna kill me?
Matt: That's your turn?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth.
Marisha: (sighs) Should I make this more interesting? What haven't we tested yet? We haven't really seen him dodge yet, right?
Taliesin: I think we should see him dodge.
Marisha: See how well he can dodge. And I throw a Fireball. (explosion)
Laura: (gasps)
Marisha: Right next to Tary.
Matt: Next to Tary? Okay.
Marisha: I don't wanna mess up Grog. Just Tary and Doty.
Matt: Okay, make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: Whoa.
Marisha: Make a wisdom saving throw?
Travis: (gasps)
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Why? Because...
Travis: Because he asked you to.
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: You find out afterwards.
Marisha: The fuck did you do?
Sam: I got tricks.
Travis: Sanctuary.
Marisha: I got-- oh, Sanctuary. Against spells? Even though this is an AOE?
Travis: What's an AOE?
Matt: Any attack or spell that targets the warded creature with an attack, so yes.
Marisha: Any attack or spell. All right. So, let's roll this one. Not great. That's not great, but luckily I got really high wisdom. So, 18.
Matt: What's your spell DC, Tary?
Sam: My spell DC? Is 17.
Matt: Okay, so yeah. Go ahead and roll your Fireball damage. Tary, I'm gonna need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Oh my God.
Marisha: Ow, jeez, oh my God. There's like-- There was like a little twinge.
Taliesin: You should have Vax work that out, later.
Marisha: I think I was-- No, it's this guy.
Sam: What do I do?
Matt: Dexterity saving throw, please.
Sam: Oh, that's not gonna go well.
Taliesin: No, you should get someone to work on that.
Marisha: I think it's Tary.
Sam: Yeah, that's an 11.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll damage if you don't mind, Keyleth.
Liam: Oh my God, he is hanging on by a thread.
Travis: This is amazing.
Marisha: Wait, where's my-- Who stole my book?
Sam: I have your book.
Marisha: Fireball!
Sam: But I need it more than you, you get nothing!
Marisha: I need to know what Fireball does.
Matt: (laughs) 8d6 points of damage.
Marisha: What is it?
Matt: 8d6 points of fire damage.
Sam: Oh my God.
Marisha: 8d6?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I got it. One-- one, two...
Laura: Where am I on my walk up? Can I hear this going on?
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: You hear the distant-- As you're walking up towards the front of the castle, you see, suddenly, this blast of multicolored arcane energy just, (shhhh) out from over the castle wall.
Laura: Take off running.
Matt: You start running. Through the castle?
Laura: As fast as I can get there-- The way I know to get there the--
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Would it be faster to go up-- Broom up and over? Into the courtyard.
Matt: Probably, otherwise you'd--
Laura: Let's do that.
Matt: Okay so you immediately take the broom, slam it under, and begin flying at dash speed. It'll still take you a couple rounds to get there.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: And as you begin to crest up you see a fiery explosion in the middle of the courtyard, now.
Laura: I make sure I take off my hat.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: 34 damage. So he did not dodge, though, right?
Matt: No, so it's 34 points of fire damage.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You're still ...
Matt: Vax!
Sam: Alive?
Taliesin: You're still alive.
Matt: It is your turn.
Liam: I take both daggers and I shove them in my belt, and I start circling down-- I'm looking at the map-- yeah, that way, and just start talking. Tary. Tary.
Sam: Who's talking?!
Liam: It's the elf boy. This is what we do, this is what we're gonna be facing, all right? Guys, we're fine, we're fine, that's enough.
Marisha: You sure?
Liam: Are you sure you want to play with us? Because we're going somewhere very dangerous very soon, and they did not play nicely with me. We're about to go to hell with someone who did not deal fairly with me.
Taliesin: Several of us have already died.
Marisha: I drop the wind wall.
Matt: And as you come up over the outside perimeter wall of castle Whitestone, you watch as the wind that is whipping around slowly subsides, and there in the center of the courtyard, you see the rest of your friends encircling Taryon Darrington, who is currently on one knee almost, and looks a little worse for wear.
Liam: You can come along, and buddy, let me tell you something, if we get in the middle of the shit, I will protect you, but it is going to be rough. And they're not going to call off their attack like we are. Are you sure you want to write this book and come with us?
Laura: Can I cannonball Trinket into the middle of it?
Matt: Sure. In the middle of this conversation, you watch, out of the corner of your eye, Taryon--
Laura: Not at Taryon, at my party.
Matt: I know, but he looks over, because they're all facing him, and he looks up and sees you arcing over the top of the wall, and suddenly there's a flash of dark energy and a large bear, an armored bear, rolls out and just breaks into the center of everyone here as Taryon's pulling back, and now roars.
Sam: (yells)
Laura: What the fuck is happening? I step away for five seconds and everybody's at war.
Marisha: No, no, this isn't war.
Travis: Yeah, we're playing.
Marisha: This is great, we were just giving him a little trial run. Isn't that right, Tary? Isn't this great?
Sam: No, this is not good.
Marisha: He's fine.
Liam: Are you changing your mind?
Sam: I can't do this. I can't do any of this. I'm sorry.
Liam: Oh, wow.
Sam: I'm not a real adventurer. That was a story I told you. I know it was very convincing, but I haven't been on any real adventures, ever, and--
Marisha: We knew that as soon as you said you wanted to rescue a damsel.
Sam: I know that you thought that I was an adventurer.
Marisha: We never-- no.
Sam: I know that you all look at me and you just see the armor and the handsomeness--
Taliesin: The armor, yes.
Sam: --and the bravado.
Taliesin: The armor.
Sam: And you think, he has it all.
Taliesin: It's very nice armor.
Sam: He has everything that we want. But it's a lie. It's a ruse.
Laura: Can I land? (all laugh)
Matt: And Trinket is still holding this aggressive stance to the rest of you, just in the vicinity, and looks a little more confused and just sits down.
Laura: Yeah, I think we're fine here, Trinket.
Marisha: You notice we tend to make a lot of people cry?
Laura: You made him cry?
Taliesin: We do.
Marisha: We make a lot of people cry.
Laura: What the fuck happened?
Taliesin: We thought we would just give him a little taste of where he's going to make sure that he was up to it.
Marisha: We told him we were gonna go see Hotis and defeat him in the Nine Hells, and we wanted to make sure he lived.
Taliesin: We couldn't have this happen in the Nine Hells.
Marisha: Yeah, look at him.
Taliesin: There's no crying in the Nine Hells.
Liam: The worst place in all the multiverse, and we're gonna let him smack into that for his first time?
Laura: Tary, you could die.
Sam: I... can I be real with you guys?
Laura: Oh, we're ready.
Taliesin: All right, all right.
Sam: (tearfully) My sister's gonna get everything. All the money. The whole business. The compound, the villas, everything. He's giving it to my sister unless I prove myself. All right? I just came out here to prove myself to my old man. And I know that if I do, he will respect me finally, and he will give me my money, and my trust fund, and he will give me my villa, and I will be the guy who takes over the business. And I just-- I thought that I could. But I can't. And I neeeed to. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Oh son, oh son.
Laura: Oh, Tary.
Liam: I walk over.
Taliesin: Daddy issues, that's all we had to hear.
Sam: I need to, I need to.
Liam: I kneel in front of him and I start massaging where I fucking beaned him.
Laura: Oh, careful there, it'll leave a bruise.
Matt: It stings a lot.
Liam: No, no, I have very deft fingers.
Marisha: Honestly, if you would've led with daddy issues, we probably would've trusted you.
Taliesin: We would've just taken you right on.
Liam: Because fathers can be assholes.
Taliesin: They're so awful.
Sam: He doesn't like me, and he doesn't like the books I read, and he doesn't like that I like fantasy novels, and he doesn't like anything about me.
Taliesin: It's like looking into a dark mirror. I don't know how I feel about this very dark mirror right now.
Liam: I take him into a gentle headlock and I turn to my sister and say, Ahh, this guy.
Laura: Ahh, this guy.
Liam: Now I like this guy.
Travis: I raise my hands above my head.
Liam: Wait, what are you doing, what are you doing?
Travis: Are we not finishing this?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No.
Liam: No.
Laura: Not so much.
Marisha: We just learned that Tary's an ugly crier. We can't beat him over the head after that.
Matt: Trinket's head pokes just into frame to you, Taryon, and he goes (licks)
Sam: (yelps)
Laura: No no no. He's my pet.
Liam: That was terrible tough love, and I'm very sorry. I think you should come with us.
Laura: What?
Liam: I think you should.
Sam: I can be like an apprentice. Or an intern. You guys are so powerful and I'm not.
Liam: Do you know something? That fucking gaudy hat you're wearing? I would have no idea how to harness the power of that hat.
Sam: Really?
Liam: I don't know shit about shit. All I know how to do is hit people in the back of the head, that's the one skill that I have. You know a lot more than I do. All you lack is experience.
Laura: Yeah, but I really am a little worried he's gonna die in the Nine Hells.
Liam: Well, I'm worried that we're all going to die in the Nine Hells.
Laura: Isn't there somewhere a little less scary we can take him?
Travis: Yeah, there's other stuff we need to do.
Liam: Is there?
Marisha: I guess we could go ahead and head to the Water Ashari. It should be fairly calm.
Travis: Tary, have you ever passed out from drinking too much?
Sam: No.
Travis: Have you ever been unconscious?
Sam: Only when I go to sleep at night. (all laugh)
Liam: Oh my gosh.
Laura: Oh no, I like him! Damn it.
Liam: We had to beat him to a bloody pulp before we liked him.
Marisha: Look, we're all fuck-ups. We like people who show their vulnerabilities.
Sam: No, I'm brave and strong.
Taliesin: No, no.
Laura: Nobody likes a dick. Well.
Marisha: Or a douchenozzle.
Laura: There it is.
Travis: Now you're using it too many times.
Marisha: Too much? Okay.
Taliesin: Your cowering honesty has won us over. Let's get you a beer. Would you like a beer?
Sam: No, I don't drink beer.
Taliesin: Would you like a glass of wine?
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: We have wine. We have a lot of wine. Some of it is quite good.
Sam: Really?
Taliesin: Really.
Sam: Because the stuff we had in Ank'harel was really gross. I didn't wanna say anything, but--
Taliesin: No, we know it was gross.
Sam: It was really gross.
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: It had no terroir.
Taliesin: Sometimes we must sacrifice for the adventure.
Laura: Do you have any wine in your bag of holding?
Sam: No!
Taliesin: We have wine.
Laura: I know, I just want to taste his wine.
Taliesin: Well, that's fair.
Sam: I don't have any wine.
Travis: Has Dotty been in any fights, or--
Sam: Doty.
Matt: Which, for the record, you now look over and Doty has been writing all this down. (all laugh)
Taliesin: You are the worst person, I love you.
Sam: Doty, no! Why? Just pause for now.
Laura: No, but seriously, was he your nanny? It's okay if he was. I just want to know.
Liam: I mean, honestly, we'd like--
Laura: We'd like you more.
Liam: We like fuck-ups. We're a family of fuck-ups, so, you want in or not?
Laura: If you're honest.
Sam: Doty is my best friend. My only friend. Because he listens to me, and understands me, and at night, when I play my characters, he plays with me. I play combat, and I pretend to be some of the characters I've read about, and he pretends to be the others.
Travis: I'm gonna kill him. (all laugh)
Laura: No, that's really wonderful. So you want to be an actor.
Sam: No, I want to be a hero. And I just haven't had the chance yet because my father says that I should just be focused on taking over the family business, learning financial things. And learning how to shake down a customer, and I'm so much more than that.
Marisha: There are other ways of being a hero than being an adventurer. There are a lot of ways you could be a hero.
Sam: Tell me one.
Laura: You could be a philanthropist.
Marisha: Yeah. People who spend a lot of their earnings and people who are more privileged, like you, who help people in less privileged places.
Liam: There are many ways to help people in need.
Sam: Do they write books about philanthropists?
Laura: A lot of times they do.
Marisha: Yeah. People generally like them.
Sam: But the stories I've read of adventure and derring-do and bravery--
Travis: Much cooler.
Sam: Much cooler!
Travis: Less boring.
Sam: Jumbo gets it.
Travis: I promise you, none of their dads leave the adventurers' money to their daughters, it's always to the sons.
Liam: But first I'd like to suggest a mantra. I don't know if you've ever tried it. It helps for me, it has in the past. Fuck your dad. That's one--
Laura: Well.
Taliesin: Well.
Liam: You know what I mean, you fucking third-grade assholes, jeepers creepers.
Sam: He could have me or any of you killed.
Liam: We'll see. The other thing is, you've done the impossible.
Sam: Which is?
Liam: Well, I've taken a shine to you for some reason. Do you wanna shake off the child's play and do the real thing?
Sam: Very much.
Liam: The truth is, you never stop being afraid. Being brave doesn't mean you stop being afraid, it means you learn to compartmentalize it. You just live with it. So that feeling you're feeling? You're not gonna lose that.
Sam: Okay. But how will I survive in battle?
Liam: Well...
Travis: Healing potions, people who look out for each other.
Taliesin: Friends. Friends.
Laura: Hide behind your giant robot.
Liam: This guys absorbs damage, so stick by him.
Laura: Stay clear if what you do is cast spells. Don't get up in the fray.
Marisha: I can cast spells, and so can Vex, here. It's through my antlers, so respect the antlers.
Sam: Oh, I do. I do. They look very powerful.
Marisha: Respect.
Sam: Something about your eyes make me feel ashamed.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Wow.
Sam: I'm sorry.
Travis: Oh, shit. That is a new one.
Laura: Let's go get a drink.
Liam: Can we get this guy drunk, please.
Taliesin: We're getting into shame and we're sober, I think something must be done about this.
Travis: We got him so close to the brink, right? Shouldn't we just introduce him to the deep end so he can say he's been there, and then we bring him up?
Laura: What, like knock him unconscious?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Please don't.
Travis: No, no, really, there's something to be said for it.
Taliesin: Why don't we do it with wine?
Liam: Yeah, yes, Percy's right.
Marisha: We could do a little roleplay exercise, like in your stories.
Taliesin: We have a magnificent library.
Sam: You do?
Taliesin: Oh, yes.
Travis: Oh, god.
Marisha: Full disclosure.
Taliesin: It's time we had another nerd.
Marisha: Full disclosure, Tary, there aren't many damsels you have to rescue in the wild. I've learned mainly because women in the world have to be tougher. So that doesn't happen very often. But, if you want, we can make pretend and do a little thought exercise, and I'll pretend to be in distress and you can rescue me if that'll make you feel better.
Travis: Yeah yeah yeah, he just has to vanquish me.
Marisha: Yeah, but you have to vanquish Grog.
Sam: All right, let's go get drunk, then.
Taliesin: Okay! (all laugh)
Marisha: Okay! (all laugh)
Liam: We really haven't had a barn-burner since we got back from the big do, you know. We should get your sister, we should get Shaun, we should get Allura and Kima and anyone who's in town.
Taliesin: Let's have a good drink, and in the morning we'll set off on the next leg of idiocy.
Liam: Yeah, you know, Tary, there's something you don't really know about-- we've just-- I mean, it's really complicated, it's hard to explain to you, you're an outsider. But we have just lost someone very dear to us. It's very complicated. And maybe we're dealing with shit that is hard, so I'm sorry if we pushed you too hard. I think there was benefit to be had from what just happened, but we're in a shitty headstate. A dear friend is gone, so, apologies.
Sam: I understand. I haven't really experienced loss of that type before. I mean. But I want to understand, and I thank you for your honesty with me and for not holding back. Did I at least cause you some harm in the battle?
Marisha: Yes!
Liam: I thought you would go down in one shot, and you were still standing!
Travis: It was pretty weak, actually.
Taliesin: I still feel a little ill.
Marisha: Yeah! And look, you singed a little of my hair!
Sam: That's good, right?
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: To be fair, we've killed dragons, so the fact that you actually managed to hold it together is actually quite impressive!
Liam: I mean, clearly we've been fucking with you a little bit, but you have ability and skill, and that's not bullshit. Seriously.
Travis: Yeah, the rest's just fake it 'til you make it, yeah?
Liam: Yeah. That will get you--
Laura: I didn't see any of it, so I'm not sure.
Sam: It was really great. It was really great?
Taliesin: Yes!
Liam: Yeah! Yes!
Sam: Thank you, thank you all. I'm sorry for deceiving you before, and I promise to do better and to aid you in whatever way I can. Please teach me your ways, and I will learn what I can.
Travis: Did you build Dotty?
Sam: For heaven's sake, yes! I did.
Liam: I believe him, I believe him.
Travis: Let's open him up and figure out if he's lying.
Sam: Please no, no, I, no--
Taliesin: No no no no no.
Laura: (laughs) Grog!
Travis: What.
Laura: Stop. (laughs)
Liam: (whispers) He's just-- he's fucking with you, it's fine. (normal volume) It's all right. It's all right. Let's go get drunk.
Marisha: Yeah!
Laura: That's all we do.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Get drunk and make people cry.
Liam: It's been too long, are you kidding?
Sam: All right, I hang back just a little bit to collect myself. Just try to dry my eyes, and I say to Doty: Doty, just delete most of that last chapter--
Matt: (sounds of Doty ripping and crumpling paper)
Sam: -- and take this down. "The battle a draw, Taryon decided it was better to lie than tell the truth, and embarked on a new adventure pretending to be their humble intern, when in actuality, they were working for him." End of chapter!
Matt: (sounds of book slamming shut and Doty walking)
Liam: Oh my gosh, that can go in any direction.
Taliesin: I love it.
Laura: So dark. SO DARK!
Travis: We're getting to the deep end!
Matt: (chuckles) As Doty follows you, you guys make your way into the castle. Wine bottles are brought about, and a raucous evening of drinking is easily found. The barn-burner you're looking for: Shaun is able to be mustered, Jarrett, Kima's still back in Emon, and actually Allura is in town briefly to retrieve Pike. And as Pike comes in, she reaches you guys. "Hi. Apparently there's still a lot of recovery that's needed in Emon and they need kind of an all-hands-on-deck circumstance with anyone who's trained in healing, so I may have to go help with that for a little bit, if that's okay?"
Liam: Oh, man.
Travis: Yeah, of course!
Laura: Whatever you need, dear.
Matt: I mean, don't-- don't go-- (sigh) don't go to any crazy hell places without me, let me know before that happens, please.
Laura: Oh. Right.
Travis: (scoffs) No, we would never!
Sam: That's exactly what they're planning on doing!
Travis: No, Tary, what did we say about lying?
Sam: They just said that they're taking me to hell, or something like that!
Laura: Well, we won't, obviously, if you don't want us to, Pike.
Taliesin: We've decided to go a little softer with him.
Liam: We're figuring it out.
Matt: I mean, try and at least let me know?
Laura: 'Course.
Marisha: Pike, I have to eventually go visit the Water Ashari, but I didn't want to do that without you.
Matt: It's fine, go! I mean, I don't know how much help I'll be other than just getting you there, but there's plenty of people that can, you know, helm a ship and get you across the sea.
Marisha: Is there any advice you can give?
Matt: Hire a good crew. Really. I was but one of many and everything I learned, I learned from watching other people. You might learn more than I did!
Marisha: All right.
Matt: Okay?
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Pike. I step away with her. (all laugh)
Laura: How are you? I mean, you're heading off to Emon right after Scanlan left, does this have anything to do with him?
Matt: I could use the distraction, to be honest. You'll be fine, I mean, it's all tying up loose ends, and I'm more needed helping people that really need what I can do right now.
Laura: I understand.
Matt: It won't be long, they're gathering a lot of great healers. I know Keeper Yennen's coming along--
Laura: Oh, good.
Matt: -- and we're gonna be doing some people some real good.
Laura: All right.
Matt: Might even bring the love of my Lady to a few people. Her light can definitely heal a lot of wounds and spirits, so.
Laura: All right. I give her a big hug, and I whisper in her ear. You don't always have to put on a brave face, dear.
Matt: She pulls back from you and kind of pats you on the side of your face.
Matt: "Yeah, I do." And she smiles and turns around and puts her hand out, and Allura takes her hand. "Are we ready?"
Travis: Wait, bye, Pike!
Matt: She lets go of Allura's hand, runs up real fast, and just slugs you in the face--
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: -- and jumps into your arms.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Ohh.
Travis: You go be a monster, and you heal all the people.
Matt: I will!
Travis: All right.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Okay, bye.
Matt: "Bye." She turns around and runs back to Allura.
Liam: It's pretty good.
Travis: That got harder, man, damn.
Liam: It's pretty good.
Matt: After Yennen is summoned forth, the three of them vanish into a swirl of arcane energy, towards the direction of Emon.
Laura: (exhales) First one goes, then the other.
Taliesin: She'll be back.
Laura: (sighs)
Liam: We're gnomeless.
Laura: Gnomeless.
Sam: Was that your girlfriend, Jumbo?
Travis: What'd you say?
Sam: Was that your girlfriend?
Liam: (sharp inhale) We just got good.
Sam: Oh. Sorry. I don't-- I'm just trying to catch up. I'll--
Taliesin: That's fair, that's fair.
Travis: Let me see your hand.
Laura: It's a fair question.
Sam: My hand?
Travis: Yeah, hold your hand out.
Sam: My hand?
Travis: Yeah, put it in mine.
Sam: Please don't kill me.
Marisha: Aw.
Taliesin: Aw.
Marisha: That was a good exercise in restraint, Grog. Proud of you.
Travis: (grumbling)
Liam: Come here. Tell me more about your father.
Sam: He's really a rotten guy. (sighs) He does these unfair deals-- nobody knows about them but me, and I tried to tell him to play on the up and up but he's just a liar and a cheat.
Liam: That's terrible. Drink up, by the way.
Sam: Oh, thank you.
Marisha: So how long have you been set forth on your little mission to prove yourself worthy?
Sam: Month, month and a half.
Liam: Really?
Marisha: Welcome aboard the proving-yourself train.
Sam: I hired a band of mercenaries to assist me for the first month.
Laura: Did you really get them killed?
Sam: No, they left me. (all laugh)
Taliesin: (sighs)
Laura: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Natural 20.
Marisha: (gasps)
Sam: Truth.
Laura: All right.
Travis: Is that your real name?
Sam: Yes, it is.
Travis: Thought you would've made a shitty name like that one up.
Sam: Taryon Gary Darrington. (all laugh)
Marisha: Wow, your dad really is an asshole.
Sam: Yes, he is.
Liam: No.
Taliesin: How's your sister, at least? Is your sister reasonable?
Sam: She's the fucking worst.
Taliesin: Oh, no.
Marisha: What?
Sam: Yes, she's so-- She's such a jock. She just does push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups all day and all night and beats on me. She's younger than me, but she's so much stronger.
Travis: What's her name?
Sam: Her name is-- I wrote this down.
Laura: What's my sister's name? You don't know!
Sam: (ugly cries) (all laugh)
Sam: Mary-Anne.
Laura: Mary-Anne Darrington.
Travis: Mary-Anne.
Sam: Mary-Anne Darrington.
Taliesin: Mary-Anne. Marian Darrington.
Laura: Marion Darrington.
Travis: Is she older, or younger?
Taliesin: Marion Darrington.
Marisha: Marion Darrington. (laughs)
Sam: My father, Howard--
Taliesin: He is the worst person.
Sam: -- and my mom, Maria.
Marisha: Maria.
Travis: Is Mary-Anne older or younger than you?
Taliesin: Younger.
Sam: Younger!
Travis: Is she married?
Sam: No. She's not a married Marion. (all laugh)
Taliesin: She's a maid Marion?
Laura: Oh...
Marisha: She's a maid Marion.
Taliesin: No. Maid Marion Darrington.
Sam: She's all focused on the business, and taking it over when Dad's ready to retire.
Taliesin: Then she'll be a made maid Marion. (all laugh)
Travis: Wow...
Taliesin: I may be drunk. (all laugh)
Marisha: That's fun.
Liam: Was there anything good about your upbringing? Any positive points?
Sam: Yes. Yes, I learned so much. I was left to my own devices for hours on end. I traveled the world... in literature. And I experienced such great adventures, tales of history and fiction and-- For most of my life, I was just a happy-go-lucky kid in my room. Reading my books, and making up characters that I would fight against, and only recently have things gotten pretty bad with Dad, since I am now of age to take over the business, and uh--
Liam: At the early age of 28?
Sam: Well, he's getting up in years. Wants to retire to the southern villa.
Taliesin: This is such a dark mirror. This is a very dark mirror.
Marisha: I'm concerned-- I'm sorry, I'm confused. Tary. That was a Freudian slip. Why does your father think it's important to have brute strength and combat experience to run a business?
Sam: It's less about strength and more about a cutthroat attitude. Take no prisoners. Hold back nothing. Pull no punches.
Marisha: Are you sure your father's a real estate agent?
Sam: To be honest, he doesn't take me along with him to many business deals, but he has great influence over many places and cities, and important people, and I don't exactly know the ins and outs of the business--
Sam: But (inhales) I do know that he is ruthless and a bastard, if you ask me truthfully.
Liam: Literally?
Sam: No, I mean, we had a grandfather, so I-- I mean, I think he's not really a bastard. I think. I don't know. What do you mean? (all laugh)
Liam: I mean. What do I mean? I mean, was he the offspring of--
Sam: He has a father.
Liam: I'm sure he does. Was he married to your mother?
Sam: I think so. They were around a lot.
Liam: So you mean, shithead?
Sam: He's an asshole.
Liam: All right.
Marisha: That's a long walk to get to shithead.
Taliesin: That was a long walk to--
Liam: There's a lot of backstory here that you're not privy to.
Marisha: What's your father's name?
Sam: Howard.
Taliesin: Howard.
Liam: Howard.
Laura: Howard Darrington.
Travis: C'mon, note-taker.
Taliesin: Show him your tattoo, I'm just sort of curious. I just had a thought.
Liam: My tattoo? What? The Slayer's Take?
Taliesin: --the Clasp.
Liam: That's a fucking Keyleth palm at this point.
Marisha: I removed it.
Taliesin: You did?
Laura: Oh...
Marisha: I burnt it off of him.
Taliesin: You're gonna make me draw it? That's fine. I'm doing the Clasp logo, if I-- Does this look at all familiar? I have the Clasp logo.
Matt: Yeah, it does not.
Marisha: Hashtag Clasp.
Taliesin: Hashtag Clasp.
Marisha: Interesting.
Sam: No. You're all literate? You can read and write?
Taliesin: Most of us, yes.
Sam: Wow. I haven't met many of you in my travels that have--
Taliesin: We even have a library.
Sam: That's amazing.
Laura: Big one.
Liam: Yeah, I mean, he's particularly brainy. You guys have a lot in common.
Taliesin: We have quite a nice library.
Liam: I mean, there's a lot of differences between the two of you, but you have a lot in common.
Sam: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Horrifyingly, yes.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, I was a bit of a reader growing up.
Sam: Oh?
Taliesin: Yes. Fiction and non-fiction. A bit of everything. I was a--
Sam: Perhaps we can compare books later?
Taliesin: I will happily show you my library.
Liam: Huh.
Sam: This guy-- This excites me.
Taliesin: Stop. Stop smiling at that.
Liam: You can teach him the art of nerd chic, Percy.
Taliesin: He seems to be well-built for it.
Marisha: You know, Percy is a bit of a tinkerer himself as well.
Taliesin: I do... Yeah.
Sam: Really?
Taliesin: Yes. Yes, I've built a few things.
Sam: That piece of equipment you showed to that weirdo earlier today-- the thing with the handle?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: Did you make that?
Taliesin: I didn't make that, but I did make this one. And I pull down the folded ridiculous--
Matt: Bad News contraption?
Taliesin: Bad News.
Taliesin: Um, yeah.
Laura: I keep filling up Grog's mug, to make sure he gets his fill.
Sam: What does that-- What does that do?
Taliesin: It takes these-- and I pull out a musket ball-- and it fires them at great speed. In whatever direction I like.
Sam: That is--
Taliesin: Very dangerous--
Sam: Sexy.
Taliesin: Thank you. It's very dangerous.
Sam: It's very sexy.
Taliesin: Thank you. I think so.
Sam: Wow. And did you make this by yourself?
Taliesin: I did. This took about six months? Seven months? I mean, I'd been thinking about it for quite a while. I'm working on a few others, too--
Sam: Wow.
Liam: Oh, I didn't know that.
Taliesin: This is kind of the definitive-- Yes, this is when we were all--
Marisha: Built it on our little summer vacation.
Taliesin: -- on the last time we took a break.
Sam: Is the propellant part of this piece right here? Or is it in that big piece right there?
Taliesin: Ah, neither. It's in this--
Sam: Or is it magical?
Taliesin: No, it's not magical at all. Everything in this is purely physical. No magic involved whatsoever.
Sam: Oh...
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Wow.
Liam: What do you make of all this?
Sam: That's impressive.
Laura: Huh?
Taliesin: Showing the mechanism off.
Liam: I don't know-- nerd talk?
Laura: I think it's great.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Uh-huh.
Liam: What do you think of the new guy?
Laura: Oh, yeah. He's weird? I don't know.
Liam: I mean, he's not Scanlan.
Laura: No.
Liam: No.
Laura: Nobody is.
Sam: Oh, you know what? I'm sorry. One second. I forgot, I owe you some money, don't I?
Laura: Yes you do.
Sam: The adventure was 50 thousand, correct?
Laura: Yes, it was.
Sam: I think I had a good adventure today. But I didn't die. So, minus the Prismatic Spray, that's 6000 gold taken off. Minus the wear and tear on my armor and equipment, that's another 5000 taken off.
Laura: Darling, this wasn't part of the deal.
Sam: Minus the fact that I wasn't the star of the adventure, I'll halve the rest of it. Do you have a tax ID or some sort of tax-exempt status?
Liam: Wait, you need to be the lead character in your death-taunting? Is that what you're telling us?
Sam: I'm just trying to find out how much I actually owe you.
Laura: No contract stipulations when we made the deal, therefore, you pay full price, darling.
Sam: I am a man of business and I always follow the law. So by my calculations, 20% federal taxes, 9.5% local and city taxes, I put that at about 11,000 gold total left still. Doty?
Taliesin: Technically, she is tax-exempt.
Sam: Write a check.
Laura: A check?
Sam: Of course.
Taliesin: She is tax-exempt.
Sam: How is she tax-exempt?
Taliesin: She's a baroness.
Sam: Make it 16.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: My father will pay that. In full.
Laura: Oh, dear lord.
Taliesin: We can put it in the treasury, technically.
Marisha: Did he just give us an IOU?
Travis: What about all the jingly-jangly in your bag of holding?
Sam: Go on and reach in there.
Laura: I know how bags of holding work.
Travis: I'll just stick my hand in the bag of holding.
Matt: It is empty. What are you thinking of while you reach in there?
Travis: Candy. (all laugh)
Matt: Does he find candy?
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Nope. It's just a void, an empty sack.
Travis: This is bullshit! You can't come with us.
Sam: Is he holding any equipment or weapons?
Matt: The weapon is near him, but not currently on him.
Sam: Okay. Fire. And I set his weapon on fire.
Matt: You watch as your hammer just ignites with flame.
Travis: You better put that out.
Sam: It's cool, though, right?
Travis: You burning my hammer?
Sam: No, no, it's magical, it's good. It helps!
Travis: I touch it.
Matt: It burns your hand. (all laugh)
Sam: Why would you touch a flame?
Travis: Because you said it was magical!
Sam: (whispers) Is he an idiot?
Taliesin: Well... I don't feel like I can answer that question appropriately at the moment.
Marisha: Legally? Maybe?
Travis: You know when people poke you in the sternum with their finger? I do that with the Titanstone Knuckle really hard.
Matt: Yeah, it hurts.
Taliesin: I pour more wine for him. More wine. More wine.
Sam: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just getting used to this.
Taliesin: No, you're fitting in very well.
Travis: You have your strengths, and while you may be able to "read" with your friends over there, I think it's also important to work on your weaknesses.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Yeah, so we gotta work on your bravery, maybe your fighting voice.
Sam: Absolutely.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Was it really bad? Did I sound okay?
Laura: No, I mean, I wasn't there to witness it, I just know your normal voice.
Travis: When you were flying over the city, did it sound like a llama being mauled by a pack of wolves?
Laura: I heard this braying. I thought it was a goat, actually.
Travis: That was him.
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: What a picture you just painted. That was lovely.
Travis: Yeah. Big tall neck, all furry.
Taliesin: No, I heard the llama.
Liam: I'm gonna squish in next to him and put my arm around with an ale and say, I don't know why I am suddenly taking a shine to you when I felt like I hated you a couple hours ago. Just stick with us. You don't have to know-- I hear everything you're saying. You're an asshole, and I love you, but you really are an asshole. I'm just talking to the guy. I have taken a shine to you, and I'm gonna look out for you, all right? The first time I got attacked I was a fucking mess. I'm still a fucking mess. That's the thing, people are writing stories about us, we're a bunch of fucking shitheads, and nobody talks about that-- maybe a few people do.
Taliesin: A few people do talk about that.
Liam: A few people do talk about that.
Marisha: I think more than a few.
Laura: A lot of people talk about that.
Liam: There's no way to prepare, you just have to hit your face against the wall a couple of times, then it starts to feel normal-ish.
Travis: I can help you with that.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Thank you.
Liam: You're good, you've done it, you've been hazed, you're good, kid.
Sam: I am so appreciative of all of you, and I will repay this debt, I promise you. I will make you guest-stars in one chapter of my book, and it will be top three most epic chapters.
Liam: That's pretty cool.
Laura: Fabulous.
Taliesin: Is the money that you're paying us with your father's money as well? Please be honest.
Sam: Yes, absolutely.
Taliesin: That's fabulous.
Laura: Oh, I like that.
Taliesin: That makes everything even better. We'll get you a room right next to the library so you can have easy access.
Sam: Thank you.
Taliesin: We can set that up right away.
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: The doors don't lock, though, so you have to be on guard all night long. Training is a 24-hour regimen around here.
Sam: All right. I accept your conditions.
Taliesin: I'll give you access to the workshop if you feel like building yourself a lock. Feel free.
Sam: You have a workshop?
Taliesin: Oh, my.
Sam: For tinkering?
Taliesin: Oh, my.
Sam: Ooh, I like you.
Taliesin: Yes, it's my pleasure. It's so nice. Of course, you'll have a tour. In the morning, we'll do a brief tour.
Sam: Absolutely. And I could show you the inner workings of Doty.
Taliesin: I would be so delighted.
Sam: It's pretty outstanding if I do say so myself.
Taliesin: It's very good work, I'm very impressed.
Sam: Little bit of luck, little bit of magic.
Marisha: Do you want us to excuse the two of you?
Matt: The two of them, as you guys are having this conversation, without realizing it, slowly exit together.
Taliesin: I'm not leaving.
Matt: Right, then you stop yourself as you reach the door.
Taliesin: I'm gonna send him to the library at the very least.
Matt: Okay, the waitstaff come in and retrieve your belongings and lead you up to the chamber that'll be prepared for your evening.
Sam: Good evening. Bye.
Laura: Bidet.
Liam: Good night, Tary, good night. Oh, boy. What a babe in the woods.
Taliesin: I kind of like him.
Laura: Grog, how ragey are you right now?
Travis: Pretty ragey, yeah.
Laura: Super ragey?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: All the people who tend not to like people are liking him.
Taliesin: It's a terrible sign, isn't it? Just really, really disturbing.
Marisha: I feel like the two of you never like the same person.
Taliesin: No, that's weird.
Liam: You know, we don't have the weight of the world crushing us at the moment, so I feel like that might have something to do with it, yeah.
Laura: It feels very strange for you two to be agreeing.
Taliesin: It does. It makes me want to take risks. It's nice.
Marisha: I thought we were taking a break from risk-taking for a second.
Taliesin: No, I feel like we've been playing it very safe, it's just been that the world has been taking risks.
Marisha: I love the way you frame things, Percy.
Liam: Once again you're a couple steps ahead of us.
Marisha: I love the way you lawyer your way out of every situation.
Taliesin: That's so nice.
Liam: I wonder where Scanlan is.
Marisha: I could check in on him. Haven't used the scrying eye today.
Taliesin: I wanna say let's give him some privacy, but at the same time I do kind of want to see him.
Laura: I just want to know if he's all right.
Travis: I don't.
Marisha: I'm gonna look. I take out the scrying eye.
Travis: Don't.
Marisha: What? Why?
Liam: I walk over to Grog and start playing-- what was it? Rock, paper, what was it?
Marisha: Boulder, parchment, shears.
Taliesin: Paper, shears or parchment, shears?
Sam: It should be parchment, shears.
Laura: It should be parchment, shears.
Liam: Trying to teach Grog that game.
Travis: No. Stop.
Liam: No?
Travis: I don't want you to look in on him.
Taliesin: I think I'm done for the evening.
Marisha: Why? We just want to make sure he's okay.
Travis: Because he asked us for his own time. Can we respect that or not? Or did you want him to yell at you more when we see him again?
Marisha: He can't know if I'm scrying on him.
Taliesin: He might know if you're scrying on him.
Laura: He might know.
Marisha: Not if I use my scrying eye.
Taliesin: Let's give him a little bit of time.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: Thank you, Grog. That's a very fair point.
Travis: Okay, now I'll play.
Taliesin: Little elf girl?
Laura: Danger-zone. I swear.
Taliesin: Is it a danger zone?
Laura: Mm.
Taliesin: Because, you know, it occurs to me, I've never given you a full tour of the treasury room, have I?
Laura: Um. Why, no, Percival.
Taliesin: I'm grabbing the wine and I'm leaving right now.
Sam: You guys are gonna fuck in the treasury? Oh my god! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Who has never wanted to have the full Scrooge McDuck? For fuck's sake. (all laugh)
Laura: As we leave, I turn to Grog. And I think about talking to him for just a second, and then I leave the room.
Taliesin: I owe you for that shit. Thank you.
Matt: All right. As the rest of you wind down the evening, drinking, perusing the treasury, reading the various books that are at your disposal--
Taliesin: We do deposit the check at the treasury, by the way, while we're there.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Deposit the checks.
Matt: You find your evening to a close.
Marisha: We haven't had the night off in a while.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: You enjoy the time to relax a bit and take another breath of air after this constant pressure that's been pushing you. Next morning comes in as the sun rises, you all come to consciousness, rouse yourselves for breakfast, and whatever the next day ensues. You all begin to gather in the common room of the castle once more.
Travis: We all healed up?
Taliesin: All healed up.
Matt: Yep, all healed up.
Taliesin: Airship or sea ship? This is your call.
Travis: We've never done a sea ship.
Liam: Yeah, I think we've got some-- We could go after the dude in hell, but I think we have some more time.
Laura: Pike asked us not to.
Taliesin: We should bring a Pike to hell.
Marisha: Pike wants to go.
Liam: I agree, I agree. So..
Marisha: All right.
Travis: Time to go finish your Atari. (all laugh)
Taliesin: We have twenty six hundred men in the back.
Marisha: All right. Do I know roughly where the water ashari are?
Matt: You vaguely know that it exists somewhere in the Ozmit Sea. Kind of south-ish from Tal'Dorei. But you don't really know. Maybe a little bit of information-gathering, or asking people who may traverse that area would help you, but you don't really know.
Laura: Yeah, we can go down to the docks. Are there docks here?
Marisha: Not in Whitestone. I think we're pretty landlocked.
Matt: Pretty landlocked in Whitest--
Taliesin: No. There is actually, technically there's the sea to the north, but that would be useless.
Sam: She meant the doctor's office.
Matt: Yeah, you have the Lucidian Ocean to the east of you.
Taliesin: Mm-hm.
Matt: But it is a very treacherous water, and the Shearing Channel, that is the series of broken land mass between here and Wildmount, the one that the Briarwoods were brokering the bridge for, is-- yeah.
Taliesin: There's a reason we're not a poor city.
Marisha: Is there like a port at the very south end of the continent, to where we could hop a ship and also do some research?
Matt: Uh, there's Stillben, very very far south.
Liam: Ooh.
Marisha: Stillben?
Matt: But that is still out to the Lucidian Ocean, east. The Ozmit Sea is on the western side of the continent. Emon is the closest port city to head to the Ozmit Sea.
Marisha: Oh, western. Oh you mean western. Okay well then, hang on. If it's w-- Nope.
Taliesin: Oh, I was about to say, who has the map? You have the map. Okay.
Laura: Yeah, it would be Emon.
Marisha: 'Cause the Earth Ashari are on the eastern side of the continent. Right?
Taliesin: Do you have a map?
Matt: The Earth Ashari are kind of northern, like mid-northern of the continent. They're in the Cliffkeep Mountains.
Taliesin: This is a conversation that is happening right now. I'm so amused.
Matt: Yes it is.
Taliesin: We're trying to remember the fake geography--
Marisha: Of our fake world--
Taliesin: Of our fantasy world.
Matt: Ask me, it's been my life for the past year. Writing all this down for a book for all you guys.
Sam: I got it.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: So Emon is like--
Sam: We're up here.
Laura: Yeah, Emon is the place to go to.
Liam: Thanks, Matt.
Laura: Thanks, Matt.
Taliesin: Yeah, yeah. We're up here. Whitestone's here.
Sam: Yeah.
Taliesin: And we need to be the south-west, so--
Liam: We will live in the stars.
Taliesin: Emon's here. Emon is the biggest port city on the Ozmit Sea, isn't it?
Matt: Uh, on this continent? Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's--
Marisha: So we might as well leave out of Emon.
Taliesin: We might as well leave out of Emon.
Marisha: And then I could also do some research, because-- Is the libraries and the lyceums and stuff open again? Or are they just fucking demolished?
Matt: You don't know. I mean, a lot of that part of the town is just now being rebuilt and recovered so--
Taliesin: Where's the airship by the way, as well?
Matt: You have not checked in on the airship. You guys--
Taliesin: When was the last time we saw them?
Matt: The last time you saw them was in the throes of the battle with Thordak, when they came in and gave it a helping hand briefly.
Laura: Did they come back here?
Sam: Just to keep up the audience  We're in Maine, and we're trying to get to Los Angeles.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Well-put.
Sam: As Taryon, can't we teleport to wherever we're trying to go?
Taliesin: It's easier to teleport if you're already been there.
Sam: Ooh.
Marisha: Yeah, unfortunately, I can't-- I've never been there. And the Ashari are a very reclusive type people.
Sam: I've read about most people and places.
Marisha: Have you read about the Water Ashari and the Ashari people?
Matt: Make a history check.
Laura: Ooh!
Taliesin: I'm gonna join in on this history check as well.
Sam: Yeah, that's a one.
Taliesin: Wow.
Sam: Her eyes just intimidate me.
Marisha: (whispering) Sam.
Laura: Shame you.
Liam: Shame! Shame!
Taliesin: (singing) No one knows what it's like, to be a bad man. Okay.
Marisha: Do you wanna touch my antlers?
Taliesin: Hey now.
Marisha: Ignore that, that got weird.
Taliesin: That got real weird. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I'm gonna join in on a terrible history check. That is a 19. It's not terrible, I just had a very high history.
Matt: It's not terrible, but your research hasn't delved too deeply into the Ashari. And the Ashari that you do know of are the Terra and uh, and the Air Ashari.
Taliesin: Yeah, I've only got what I read at home.
Matt: There's the Terra and the Zephra. Those are the only two you know about. Those are the only two on the continent. The Vesrah you're not too familiar with.
Taliesin: Well, who else can we talk to?
Marisha: I mean, I guess I could always go back to the Earth Ashari, or the Air Ashari, and talk to some of those people.
Laura: Maybe somebody at the docks in Emon would know?
Taliesin: She really wants to go to the docks in Emon.
Laura: I wanna just pay off that docks comment, really. (all laugh)
Sam: Worth it.
Taliesin: Magic.
Marisha: I don't know. I guess we could go back and talk to the Earth Ashari. You guys haven't been there yet.
Laura: Let's go!
Taliesin: Let's go to the Earth Ashari.
Marisha: Yeah, all right.
Taliesin: Let's collect our things. What's the temperature like there?
Laura: Ooh.
Marisha: Right now, with it being the Season of-
Taliesin: The witch.
Matt: It's in essentially a heavy valley of stone in the center of the Cliffkeep Mountain range. It is far from civilization, it's maybe a few days of heavy mountain-- constant hiking north of where Kraghammer is.
Marisha: Oh. We'd have to hike to get there? No, there's gotta be trees that I can Tree Stride there to.
Matt: There are a couple that aren't too far outside of Terra that you can Tree Stride to.
Marisha: We're druids, there's gotta be trees within that camp, right? And stuff?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Like, nearby?
Matt: Yes, I'm saying that there are some that are like, just in the outskirts of Terra, none directly in it.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Oh shit! Okay, no. Nothing. I had resistance to something and I forgot to use it. (all laugh)
Travis: Resistance to a beating?
Sam: Yeah. Would not have helped me very much.
Taliesin: Let's also say, as we're getting ready, I'm gonna take Tary down and let him pick through the tinkering room, see if he needs any tools and upgrade anything that he might need, give him a quick tour.
Laura: And I wanna talk to Grog.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: (whispered) I'll take everything.
Matt: So as you guys are taking through the--
Taliesin: Showing him the equipment.
Matt: You find Grog off to the side.
Taliesin: Don't touch that.
Laura: How are you?
Travis: Me?
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: I'm good. I slept really well.
Laura: Yeah. Feeling less rage-y?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: That's good, that's good. Okay. Hey, so... This is difficult for me to do. Did you know that Scanlan had acquired drugs?
Travis: No?
Laura: Did you?
Travis: No.
Laura: I just found this out, that he was using drugs behind our back.
Travis: Like bad drugs?
Laura: I think so, I mean, I've never tried them, but--
Travis: Me neither.
Laura: So, I don't know, finding out secrets about people doesn't feel good. Feeling like they've broken your trust in some way, right? And being trustworthy is very important.
Travis: Right, yeah, I think that's very important.
Laura: Right. So. Just hold on.
Travis: I'm not even fighting anyone right now.
Laura: Ah. I pull out the deck. So, this is-- Do you know what this is? Do you remember this?
Travis: Where did you find one?
Laura: Okay. So, Grog, I have to be honest with you. When you asked me for this before, I lied. To you.
Travis: You lied?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: What do you mean?
Laura: Well, I sort of tricked you and thought it'd be funny if I gave you maybe the wrong thing. To see if you'd notice! But-- I'm still lying. I didn't-- I was afraid-- I gave you a false deck.
Travis: No, no, you gave it to me, it's in my bag.
Laura: You wanna pull it out?
Travis: But you said I wasn't supposed to look at it.
Laura: Well, you're still not supposed to, technically. Do you want me to pull it out?
Travis: Phrasing. (all laugh)
Laura: Should I-- Should you-- Do you just--
Travis: You want me to get the deck out?
Laura: Yeah, maybe close your eyes and get the deck out. (all laugh)
Travis: All right, I got it.
Laura: All right, I am taking it from your hand.
Travis: But these are mine!
Laura: These ones are--
Travis: Don't take them from me again!
Laura: Grog! Open your eyes. It's not really a deck, you see? It's a bag. With rocks in it.
Travis: Did you take my salt lick rock?
Laura: No. You gave that to Scanlan. Here's your deck. Still don't use it, still don't look at it, it's still very dangerous! But I want you to know that I trust you with it.
Travis: I know. You said, "Don't look at it," and I haven't looked at it.
Laura: Oh, good, then still don't, how about that?
Travis: I'm very confused. (all laugh)
Laura: I know, basically, I just--
Travis: Do you want a card?
Laura: No! I don't know.
Travis: I open the flap--
Laura: No no no! Don't-- Grog!
Travis: Do you want a card? What're you worried about, it's a deck of cards.
Laura: You're making me regret giving this back to you right now. I just want to say. I close it. Please don't make me regret this.
Travis: Why?
Laura: I'm sorry that I lied to you. Even though you didn't notice. I want you to know you can still trust me, and I can still trust you to not fuck with this.
Travis: I would like to insight check Vex.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Liam: (laughing) I love you guys.
Travis: Six. (all laugh)
Matt: It's a lot of words. It's a lot of words. But you got your deck back.
Travis: But I always had it.
Matt: You-- It's really confusing. She's talking at you, but nothing changed.
Travis: Is this a lesson?
Laura: Sure.
Travis: Can we just skip to the part where you get so frustrated that I haven't got it and you just tell me the answer anyway?
Laura: Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: You're a good person. Still don't look at the deck. I'm glad you have our back. Don't do drugs.
Travis: What do you think Scanlan did with the rest of those drugs?
Laura: What do you mean 'the rest of the drugs'?
Travis: Well, you said he was doing drugs, right?
Laura: Right.
Travis: Well, did he just take them with him?
Laura: Should we search his room?
Travis: Ooh, maybe!
Laura: Let's do it.
Travis: All right, I put the deck away.
Matt: Okay. You guys head up to Scanlan's room.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Both you guys make investigation checks.
Liam: You've done a lot of brilliant things. That was the most brilliant thing you have ever done.
Taliesin: I am so consistently proud of you.
Liam: Oh my god.
Travis: 16. 18 minus two.
Laura: Oh! 16 for me as well.
Travis: Hey!
Laura: Hey!
Matt: Together you both see-- You both spend the better part of an hour thumbing through the various drawers and odd boxes and sundries that were left behind in the wake of Scanlan's departure. And at the same time you both come to find that, no, there are-- no illegal substances remain.
Laura: He took them with him!
Travis: What about nudey pictures?
Laura: Oh, nudey pictures.
Taliesin: Other things, what else is in the room?
Matt: Honestly? There are no nudey pictures, per se.
Travis: Boring.
Matt: You do find a series of books on art and the human physique.
Travis: Ugh.
Matt: And all the corresponding images have been torn out.
Laura: (laughs) Yeah.
Travis: Damn it.
Sam: I have magic that can make things that are way more real than a drawing.
Taliesin: He has three original print issues of Cherry Comics number one through four.
Travis: Well, there's no drugs.
Laura: Well, I guess he took them with him.
Travis: All right. When do I get to look at the cards?
Laura: Like, never, Grog.
Travis: Like, never never? Never, never?
Laura: Well, I heard from Percival that they're super, super dangerous. But I don't know what they do.
Travis: Yeah, you don't.
Laura: No, I don't.
Travis: Only one way to find out! Not today.
Laura: Not today, how about that?
Travis: Fair enough.
Laura: All right.
Matt: All right. You've joined the rest of the party, the rest of-- After you guys finish your perusal of the workshop, which is quite a workshop, mundane in a lot of ways, but functional for the basic purposes of tinkering.
Taliesin: Rustic!
Matt: Rustic.
Taliesin: Rustic.
Sam: I think it's magnificent, what you've put together here.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: And I'm impressed, and from me that's quite a compliment.
Taliesin: No, I'm feeling it. And, my workshop, obviously, is your workshop for as long as you stay here. Anything you need to work on, of course, it's fully available.
Sam: You know what? I don't normally do this, but... What's your name? (all laugh)
Marisha: Oh my god. He doesn't know any of our names!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: We're like a bad speed dating session. Holy shit.
Taliesin: This is so amazing. Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo the third. At your service.
Marisha: Oooh! He's still got it!
Sam: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo the third. All right.
Taliesin: Percy to my friends.
Sam: I'm Tary to mine.
Taliesin: Tary, it's a pleasure. This is the castle I live in, this is my sister's castle, except of course, she's lovely. Cassandra de Rolo.
Sam: Hm.
Taliesin: You are in Whitestone, as our guest.
Sam: It is my honor and privilege to be your guest, sir.
Taliesin: A pleasure. I recommend eventually, not necessarily today 'cause I am actually enjoying it, learning everyone else's name as well.
Sam: All right, well. Okay. (all laugh)
Sam: Let's Tary-on! No? Maybe?
Taliesin: No it's-- I'm okay with it, I'm rolling with it.
Marisha: No! No.
Sam: Doty! Doty, put it as a maybe.
Marisha: Not becoming a catchphrase.
Taliesin: It's not a catchphrase.
Sam: Doty, put it as a maybe for catchphrases.
Matt: You guys gather up--
Taliesin: Another daring rescue.
Matt: Together, prepare yourselves for what the next step of your journey is. What are you doing?
Marisha: Are we going? Are we going?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Going, going, gone, gotta go?
Taliesin: Got your stuff together? Everything you need?
Laura: Are we going to Emon? No. We're going to the earth-- the earth people.
Marisha: Got everything. Earth people first.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So we can be like, where do I find the other fourth of my tribe.
Taliesin: You've written your camp number. In pen, on your arm.
Marisha: Yes, I've got my safety tags.
Taliesin: You've got your safety tags.
Marisha: I'm good. I'm good.
Taliesin: You've got your rights written on the back, so that, y'know. If anyone tries to--
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: Let's do it, let's--
Marisha: All right, let's go.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Respect. Respect the antlers.
Liam: Always have.
Taliesin: We decorated them at the last winter festival.
Marisha: I like decorating my antlers.
Taliesin: And it looked quite nice.
Marisha: It's a traditional Ashari tradition.
Liam: All right. Eyes on the prize.
Laura: Let's go!
Matt: (laughs) You guys find your way to the Sun Tree. Utilizing Transport via Plants you find yourself (teleportation sound) thrust through the trunk of the Sun Tree, and emerging on the opposite side, on the cusp of a deep bowl-like valley that goes probably for a good mile and a half, or two miles across, before you reach the other side of this crest.
Liam: Tary! That's two times! You've teleported two times.
Sam: (gasps) Oh my god, every time it's amazing. Wow, thank you. Thank you all. Where are we?
Taliesin: Uh.
Marisha: Well.
Matt: Central Cliffkeep.
Marisha: We are in the central Cliffkeep
Sam: Of?
Marisha: Of Tal'Dorei. And of the central-- Of the Cliffkeep Mountains.
Sam: So cool.
Marisha: Yeah! (all laugh)
Matt: You glance around, and there are the edges of a forest here. A lot of them are stockier trees, and things that live in harsh environments, and a lot of them are rooted in cracks in the ground, and portions of the rock that have split open. Down within this valley, you can already see what appear to be dozens and dozens of trenches, that seem to have been dug. And there are areas of this valley that appear to have eroded or collapsed. Like small, long rockslides that are just kind of dotting the edges of the mountain walls. Down towards the center you can see, also, a cluster of dozens and dozens of small abodes, it looks like. Homes, huts, structures made of rock. This is Terra, this is the Earth Ashari village here. Currently guarding over the localized rift to the Earth Elemental plane. You guys are traversing down into it?
Marisha: Yep
Matt: It takes you a short time, you find one of the paths that kinda zigzags down the side of this mountain drop, and make your way in towards the center. The sun is now-- I'd say at this time, just over the very top, kind of noon-ish portion of the day. You begin to walk your way in and it's very warm here, partially because the-- It's northern enough where usually it's a colder temperature on the island-- Don't you even, you motherfucker.
Liam: Wow. You lasered in on that like nobody's business!
Travis: (gunshots)
Matt: I'm a little sensitive (all laugh)
Matt: But the further down you get it is just-- The tree line has stopped and it is just rock, stone, that is reflecting the light and it is warm. You're starting to find yourself sweat in your full armor as you traverse deeper and deeper into the center of this mountain valley.
Marisha: It's always like 20 degrees warmer in the valley.
Laura: (laughs) Terrible.
Matt: Disadvantage on the next roll. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Thank you for turning us into an episode of California, yes.
Liam: That's a little bit of Los Angeles actor humor for you guys over in Sweden today.
Travis: (surfer accent) Californians.
Taliesin: To get to Critical Role, take the 101 with the 5 to get up to Burbank to get to Critical Role.
Liam: For all you fans in Germany, that's a little San Fernando valley humor!
Taliesin: From beautiful downtown Burbank.
Sam: I loved it, you can do no wrong.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Exactly.
Marisha: I like Tary.
Matt: Yeah. So as you continue downward, you get maybe a quarter-mile into this walk, still relatively far from the village, before-- And you recognize this. You watch as one of the nearby trenches, (earth moving) shifts up about two feet in stone, and you watch as three figures step out from within the trench and begin walking towards you.
Travis: Are we killing these?
Marisha: Stop-- No, no? These are-- Grog!
Travis: Sorry, but--
Taliesin: They're sending us to the things we're going to kill.
Travis: Oh! Okay.
Marisha: Everyone, wait for a second. I step forward a second.
Matt: Okay. You watch as three humanoids approach.
Travis: Lambchop-looking motherfucker.
Sam: Just a stick. Just a stick. It doesn't do anything.
Taliesin: It's from the walking company.
Matt: They are clad in darkened leathers, furs, and it looks like a lot of the armor and garb here is taken from hunted creatures and animals that have been prepared and tanned, here within the sun-wracked center of this mountain valley. The two to the-- Flanking the central figure appear to be human, male and female, both very short, kind of tossed hair. Then at the center you see what appears to be a surprisingly short, but very stocky and thick, half orc female. As she approaches she has-- the hair is woven back into these thick braids that are pulled into a singular, what looks like a topknot, on the upper back of her skull. Her jaw protrudes a bit, you can see the two lower fangs kinda pushing past the lips.
Marisha: Is this Patisse?
Matt: No, this is--
Travis: Lower fangs?
Laura: She's a half orc.
Liam: Yeah, she's got the big teeth.
Matt: This is Rockcaller Dryden.
Laura: Rockcaller--?
Matt: Dryden.
Laura: Not that I would know that.
Liam: (sing-song) Rock Caller Dryden
Sam: Good old RCD.
Marisha: Do I know Dryden from before?
Matt: You do.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: This is not the headmaster of the tribe,
Marisha: Right.
Matt: But one of the central sentinels that's around this portion here.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: Approaches you, and for a moment puts a hand out almost to hail you, and then recognizes your face and steps forward. "Keyleth? What brings you to Terra?"
Marisha: Kaitiaki, Dryden.
Matt: Kaitiaki.
Marisha: How are you?
Matt: We are well.
Marisha: Have you fared well here recently, in the past several months?
Matt: We have hunkered down. Our business was to make sure that no more of the Rifts befall the same fate of the Pyrah.
Marisha: Have you talked to Cerkonos or Korren at all?
Matt: Not recently, no.
Marisha: We have slayed the Chroma Conclave. All the dragons are dead.
Matt: Then this is a time for celebration.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: I will pass this along.
Marisha: I was wondering if I could speak to Headmaster Patisse.
Matt: Perhaps, but what do you wish to speak on?
Marisha: I am intent on continuing my journey on to the Water Ashari tribe. And I need information from him.
Matt: To the Vesrah. Very well. I could help you with this information if need be.
Marisha: Is Patisse indisposed?
Matt: No. No, right this way.
Marisha: I mean it would just be nice to, like, say hi. While I'm here at least.
Matt: "Very well." They turn around and begin to lead you back towards the outskirts of the city, not directly into Terra itself, but as you approach, and walk past, you can see the ground here-- every ten minutes or so you feel a sudden shift, and a slight quake beneath your feet. The landscape here, the closer you walk to the center of the village, seems to be in this perpetual state of shifting rock. And you watch as different areas kind of collide. Areas of stone kind of (cracking noise), and rocks tumble down. Parts of it break and crack and reform. At one point, as you guys are not maybe 200 feet out from the first major structures, the ground has one major spike. (loud rock slide) And you hear this heavy rolling rumble, and you watch as, maybe 300 feet off from the side, a new pinnacle is formed. Two big plates kind of (crack), jut upward, one kind of coasting over the other and coming to a halt. There is very heavy localized seismic activity as part of the proximity to the rift of the earth elemental plane here. And you watch as three druids come rushing out of the side of the Terra tribe, and as they focus, the rocks (crumbling noises) crumble back down and subside. The central mountain landscape, here, brought back to a momentary beat of peace and quiet.
Marisha: I'm like a New Yorker on a subway.
Matt: Yeah. Just going straight in.
Marisha: I'm just like, whatever. Used to this.
Laura: Must wreak havoc on the local architexture.
Travis: Architexture?
Laura: Architexture.
Marisha: Oh, it's built-- We've got infrastructure built for that sort of thing. It's fine, they're used to it here.
Matt: Right. As you progress inward, and some of the other Terra Ashari--
Laura: Shut your mouth, you wouldn't even know what architecture is!
Matt: Different visual representations. Some appear to be more ornamental. Jewelry seems to be here, like jewels and metallics used, it seems to connote a level of prestige within the tribe, and every individual that walks, usually with a cluster or protectors around them, or at least, seems to be in a place of notable importance within groups, seems to be more adorned in this natural-based jewelry. You know exactly where to go to head straight to the hut in which the headmaster resides and as--
Liam: And I'm watching her stride through here with confidence, just impressed.
Marisha: Rockcaller. Rockcaller. Oh Jerry! How you been? How's the kids?
Liam: Jerry! Jerry!
Marisha: Jerry! JERRY!
Matt: What looks to be a heavy wooden doorway, built out of a series of tree trunks that are strapped to this one area. Just (tree trunks shifting) shifts open and now you see, walks a very tall, thin, and older, like mid-60s human male, who is adorned in a similar tattoo pattern as the Rockcaller you saw earlier. But it seems to reside from the center of the cheeks and through the jowls and then crosses across the neck and then across the arms all the way down to the fingertips.
Laura: (quietly) Tight.
Matt: And there are certain portions which are broken up by hard lines, it's like this parallel intersection multiple times as the tattoo progresses down. Very, very loose, almost a flowing central shoulder-based robe that tosses down the front of the body and meets with a long skirt that drags behind him as he steps out. And as he looks over in the direction of you, you can see the eyes are very hardened, dark, deep brown in color, and the sockets are very weathered, his skin texture in general is pretty weathered. He looks over towards you, clean-shaven, short white hair, puts a hand up. "Keyleth, you grace the Terra with your presence. What can we be of service to you for?"
Marisha: I stand more in attention, more formal. Good to see you, Patisse, it's been quite some time.
Matt: You as well.
Marisha: I just came to check in after the recent events in the world, make sure everyone was okay.
Matt: Everything seems to be fine. We've been intent of care to the rift, and from the word that seems to have passed quickly since your arrival over the past few days, it's come to our attention that Thordak no longer sits in the center of the city of Emon.
Marisha: That's correct. We've also slain his right-hand man, Raishan, who seemed to be the mastermind of the entire orchestration.
Matt: Good. Good and well done.
Marisha: Thank you. I couldn't have done it without your help and training, so I appreciate that.
Matt: You are but a seed, you allowed it to germinate. So what do you need?
Marisha: Well, I'm intent on continuing on with my Aramente now that there's relative peace in the world. The Vesrah people are quite insular, of course. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to get there and any advice in general on dealing with them?
Matt: It has been a long time since I've attended any sort of gathering with the Vesrah. It is for people of our skill set not the easiest of journeys, as many of us are capable of traversing through the sentinels of nature. Unfortunately, most of the tree life that exists around Vesrah is beneath the water.
Marisha: Right.
Matt: So your most likely form of transport will be that of a vessel across the waves.
Marisha: Who's their headmaster there now? Do you know?
Matt: The headmaster there-- Uvenda, the heart of the tides.
Marisha: Uvenda.
Matt: Uvenda.
Marisha: Uvenda, the heart of the tides. What can I expect of this Uvenda? Uvenda.
Matt: Not what you'd expect. I'll leave it at that.
Marisha: That's very vague of you, Patisse.
Matt: Well, what would be the fun if I were to unveil the next fold of your Aramente?
Marisha: No, you've got a point. Do you recommend by ship or would flight be more appropriate?
Matt: If you have the means, that is up to you.
Marisha: All right. Any other words of encouragement?
Matt: Listen closely. Keep your friends about you. That should be sufficient.
Marisha: Oh, sorry, I probably should've introduced-- by the way, this is my band I've been traveling with, Vox Machina. And Tary. Tary Darrington.
Sam: Lovely to meet you. I have no idea where we are right now.
Matt: Good, keep it that way.
Marisha: He's new.
Laura: Can I ask a question? Is that all right?
Marisha: Of course.
Laura: Is it polite?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: (quietly) Hi, sorry. You mentioned that the water Ashari live under the water.
Matt: They don't live beneath the water, not entirely.
Laura: Okay, I thought maybe they were like mer-people or something, I wasn't sure.
Marisha: That would be awesome.
Laura: Yeah, right? That'd be really cool.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Cool. So we'll see them above land then if we're flying.
Matt: Some of them, yes.
Laura: Some of them. All right, that was my question. Thank you for your answer. Thank you.
Marisha: Are there any other landmarks or ways of navigation to find them? They're an island in the middle of the Ozmit sea.
Matt: It's not the island of usual appearance. The beaches and sands of Vesrah are built upon a great circular reef. And part of the city lies above, part of it lies below.
Travis: (quietly) Sick.
Marisha: (quietly) Awesome.
Matt: Look for the white sands beneath the surface. Some structures will be visible from above. It would lie quite a ways to the southwest, not too far from the Hespit. I would recommend perhaps procuring the service of someone who knows the sea well.
Marisha: Yes. We were going to look into trying to do that. Well, is there anything you need from me, Patisse, before we head on?
Matt: No. Just do your best to have your friends keep the location of our village to themselves.
Marisha: Don't worry, we have many places we'd prefer to keep this way.
Matt: Good. I trust you all. Safe journeys. Keep her safe.
Taliesin: Of course.
Laura: Always.
Matt: The tempest needs a new voice.
Marisha: Thank you for your belief in me. Kaitiaki, Patisse.
Matt: Kaitiaki, young Keyleth.
Sam: You're welcome.
Laura: Kai... tiaki.
Marisha: (quietly) Good job.
Taliesin: Kaitiaki. (all laugh)
Sam: Kaiahoga.
Marisha: What did you say?
Laura: Kamehameha.
Liam: Ticonderoga... pencils.
Sam: I pull Vax aside and say--
Liam: What's up, buddy?
Sam: Poise, grace, confidence, she is amazing.
Liam: Yeah? That's true.
Sam: Is she your leader?
Liam: Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes.
Sam: (quietly) Incredible.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: I'm learning so much already, thank you again.
Liam: That's-- you're welcome, that's good. That's good. One step at a time.
Sam: Absolutely.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Vax, you made sure Tary partook of some of the soil here, right? It's an Ashari tradition, right?
Liam: What? Are you asking me if he shit here? What are you talking about?
Travis: No, no. He has to eat-- did you? Tary, did you manage to get some of the soil in your mouth?
Sam: The what in my mouth?
Travis: It's a custom here you have to eat the dirt of the earth Ashari.
Liam: I walk off. I'm not getting part of this.
Sam: Absolutely. I will do it.
Travis: You don't want to be offensive.
Sam: You're absolutely right.
Travis: Yeah. Custom is important.
Sam: Mm-hm. Following the local customs, I took a handful of dirt and shoved it down my fucking throat. (all laugh)
Matt: (coughs) You go into an immediate coughing fit as the--
Sam: (coughs)
Matt: -- the surface dirt here is built from constant colliding of stone and rock, and a lot of it has been ground to almost a fine powder in places--
Liam: Have some volcanic ash.
Matt: -- yeah, yeah. It's akin to the cinnamon challenge in a way. (all laugh)
Sam: (coughs)
Travis: Just stay with it, the first time's the worst. Don't dilute it with any water or anything.
Taliesin: Just thinking, it's like diatomaceous earth. Just hateful.
Travis: You're toughening up already.
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: Ooh, your voice sounds deeper.
Sam: Yeah, that is my vocal cords being covered in dirt.
Travis: I like this.
Laura: Why are your vocal cords covered in dirt?
Sam: I just ate dirt.
Laura: Why on earth would you eat dirt?
Sam: I'll go into my satchel and pull out some healing draught, and just-- ah, just take a big gulp.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: It feels much better.
Sam: Much better. Shall we?
Taliesin: Yes, let's.
Liam: Kiki, what do you think? Are we staying here for the night, or-- I mean, we just got here, it's the middle of the day, isn't it?
Laura: Can we Treestride again today?
Marisha: Yeah, we can.
Liam: We need to make camp? You need to rest? Or can we go now?
Marisha: I'm good. After this we'll probably have-- No, I'm good. I mean--
Taliesin: We Treestride, we get a ship, and then--
Marisha: And then I'll be resting.
Taliesin: -- we spend a night on the ship.
Laura: Ooh, I like it.
Travis: I like it.
Taliesin: Isn't that gonna be fun?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: I haven't been on a ship si-- Oh my, yeah.
Marisha: Are we gonna do the airship, or-- no, I guess we left the airship in Whitestone.
Taliesin: Well, we-- technically, we--
Marisha: Or did we leave it in Emon?
Taliesin: We left it in Emon.
Matt: Emon.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Hopefully, it's-- you know, let's see if it's still intact.
Travis: What's wrong with a boat? We haven't been on a boat.
Marisha: That's true.
Taliesin: I'm kind of feeling the boat.
Travis: Yeah, me too.
Marisha: You guys wanna go on a boat?
Liam: You are feeling the boat over the airship?
Taliesin: I haven't been on a boat in a long time, and I'm feeling a little weird about an airship.
Travis: Thank you.
Liam: I know, but you practically sang ballads for airships for weeks.
Taliesin: I know.
Laura: Yeah, and we got one.
Taliesin: We did-- we could--
Travis: He tap-dances on boats.
Taliesin: I mean, I wouldn't object to it, I just--
Liam: So one and done, all right.
Marisha: Wait, does this mean--
Laura: We can be regular pirates now.
Marisha: Does this mean we can get yacht gear if we go on a boat-- or pirate gear?
Liam: I'm on a boat!
Taliesin: I'm not getting the proper shoes.
Laura: (gasps) Pirate gear!
Marisha: Pirate gear!
Sam: Boat shoes? I own boat shoes.
Taliesin: I knew you would.
Liam: What does that mean?
Travis: You do?
Sam: They're great, they're flat-soled, they are white, and--
Liam: White.
Taliesin: They are.
Sam: Yes, they are--
Marisha: You mean like Keds? You're talking about Keds?
Taliesin: No, no, they're boating shoes.
Sam: Boat shoes.
Marisha: Boat shoes. (laughs)
Taliesin: They're actually boating shoes. I am embarrassed that I know exactly what you're talking about.
Sam: Of course.
Liam: Your boating shoes, I'm sure, are very white.
Sam: Yes, they are.
Travis: What are they made of, leather?
Sam: With little leather stripes--
Travis: Yeah, they're made of leather.
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: And a little sailor's cap.
Laura: No.
Liam: Ooh, no.
Taliesin: I'm so excited.
Sam: I have a navigator's kit.
Matt: He does, it's-- (all laugh)
Matt: He does.
Sam: Let's set sail!
Matt: Yeah!
Sam: A sextant and everything.
Taliesin: That is-- that is my favorite phrase in the English language, is "I have a kit for that."
Marisha: I have a kit for that. (laughs)
Taliesin: You have just come upon it.
Matt: I'm so excited that worked out.
Liam: What is going on?
Matt: All right. So--
Marisha: Well, that's fun.
Matt: You find your way back to the edge of the valley, to the same tree that you made your Transport via Plants through--
Marisha: I do the touristy thing to 'em again on the way out, like I do.
Matt: Pointing out. What is your destination tree?
Marisha: (stammers)
Taliesin: Pine.
Marisha: Our keep. Greyskull Keep. Garden. Tree.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry. That just took a while to find in my brain.
Laura: I imagine you saying all that as you touch the tree.
Marisha: (stammers) It's been a long few weeks.
Travis: The channel just--
Marisha: Only the best, only the best.
Matt: You transport from the outskirts of Terra, find your way back to Greyskull Keep, and walking towards Emon proper. You can see now, even from the distance as you approach, the walls, some of the larger buildings, the higher towers and structures that just barely peek over the wall, you can see are already in the process of repair. You can see--
Laura: Wow, that was fast.
Matt: -- teams of people that are in-- currently trying to rebuild and restructure as you enter from the southern gates of the city and enter the streets, it's more lively than you've ever seen it. People are returning. People are coming back and reclaiming what remains of their homesteads, many of them still intact without a problem. The damage was extensive, but not universal in the city, and so I'd say there's still a good 60% to 70% of the city that is mostly without damage, and there are areas that are just destroyed, but even those, people are picking up, reclaiming-- There appears to be a process of memorial being constructed on the outskirts of the Cloudtop to remember those who fell in the battle for Emon. There is also the skyport, which was on the outskirts of the Cloudtop, and up there you can see the skyship Deera, however it looks to have sustained a severe amount of damage--
Liam: Damn it!
Matt: -- in the battle, and is in the process of also receiving its own repairs.
Liam: Son of a bitch.
Laura: Oh, I hope Captain Damon's all right.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Oh, jesus.
Laura: He's so dreamy.
Travis: Heartthrob Damon.
Taliesin: He's just gotten a little scar.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: The perfect scar.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Now he's dangerous Damon.
Marisha: Cap Damon.
Laura: He's got the-- no, he's got the Harrison Ford.
Taliesin: Is this the Harrison Ford, or is it the scar right below the cheek so that when he cries it hits the scar and goes down.
Marisha: Oh yeah, and it trickles down.
Liam: I mean either way, he can make it work, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah. All right, so what are you guys doing?
Taliesin: It's like a little pachinko machine of pain.
Travis: Run the canal, run the canal.
Liam: Don't leave me hanging up top. Woo!
Laura: That was a good one.
Marisha: Pike's here, right? She's in the city.
Matt: Pike is in the city somewhere, you haven't found her, you don't know where she is.
Marisha: 'Cause I imagine she would have good recommendations on good crews--
Liam: Boats.
Marisha: -- and boats.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Marisha: So, let's try and find Pike.
Travis: Didn't she just say a good crew? She just said to find a good crew.
Laura: Find a good crew.
Taliesin: She wouldn't maybe not know, necessarily.
Marisha: Would Pike know if there's a good crew? Let's save ten minutes on finding Pike. Would Pike know if there's a good crew?
Matt: Pike had one crew that she travelled with on the ocean--
Liam: Seems dodgy.
Sam: They're all dead.
Taliesin: They're not dead, they just left her.
Matt: But that crew, I will say for the sake of time, is not currently docked at Emon.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: She was busy doing push-ups on that cruise.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: One-handed.
Laura: Let's go to the docks, you guys. Today.
Marisha: To the docks!
Matt: You find yourself at the western docks of Emon.
Liam: Ter the dercks!
Marisha: Ter the dercks!
Taliesin: Ter the dercks.
Matt: You hear the familiar sound of seagulls and other water-based fowl, mixed with the creaking of wood from large ships that are all making their way in and out of this rather large port here on the side of the Ozmit Sea. You can see there's a lot of goods coming into the city now, as a lot of heavy orders have come from nearby villages to transport goods as part of the recovery, both from the south from the Mornset as well as things that were too large to carry by cart from Syngorn, and have been coming up along the coast, avoiding Dagger Bay, and making their way up to Emon. There are a number of individuals around, and who would want to spearhead the investigation--
Marisha: I'm not good at investigating. Who's good at investigating?
Laura: I'll go.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Roll an investigation check.
Liam: I'll back you up. Me too, me too.
Taliesin: Looks good.
Laura: 19?
Liam: 18. Oh, you've done me in by one.
Laura: Oh, by one!
Liam: One.
Matt: Asking about for a while, you eventually-- people point you in the direction of what appears to be an individual named Dockmaster Abban.
Marisha: Dockmaster Oban?
Liam: Abban.
Matt: Abban. A-B-B-A-N.
Marisha: Abban.
Taliesin: Abban.
Marisha: A-B-B-A-N.
Matt: You're eventually led to this individual who, pointed out, is dressed simply at first glance. The clothing he wears, just a plain white, billowing shirt, nice tailored pants, and some boots that go just up to the mid-calf. Dark brown-red skin, completely shaved, smooth, bald, shining in the sun, no facial hair, with piercing blue-grey eyes. As soon as you begin to approach, he's finishing a conversation with someone and turns to you and flashes the brightest of white smiles and goes, "Hello! Ah, you look like you are looking for some help, or in aid of something, yes? No?"
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You're staring at me. What do you want?
Laura: We are-- I don't know if you've noticed, but the city has just been saved.
Matt: I have noticed it, strangely enough. I've watched it be saved, and--
Laura: Yes, then you maybe saw us in the fray, and now, after saving this beautiful city, we are on our way to the middle of the fucking sea. Would somebody be able to take us?
Matt: Well, are you looking for a-- to purchase a vessel?
Laura: No. To rent a crew of well-seasoned sailors who know their way around the ocean.
Matt: I guess it really depends on the size of the vessel you're taking-- what ship do you have?
Taliesin: We're looking to-- I'm cutting in for a second--
Laura: Sure, darling.
Liam: Sure.
Taliesin: -- charter, dear, charter. You're looking to charter.
Laura: We're looking to charter a ship.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I just learn so much from you, you know?
Taliesin: I-- well, this was just--
Travis: Barf.
Laura: Take over.
Matt: And where are you travelling?
Taliesin: No, please.
Liam: Ah, that's complicated.
Laura: Well, just very close to Hespit, actually, not far so-- very far southwest--
Matt: How close to the Hespits?
Liam: We're hoping for a bit of a discount for the group that is responsible for this city still existing.
Taliesin: She's much better at this than you.
Marisha: Oh, man.
Liam: Give it a second, please.
Taliesin: Okay.
Liam: Doubting Thomas.
Matt: I have-- I apologise, I do not follow this train of thought. Discount?
Liam: (sighs) Do your fucking thing, whatever. (all laugh)
Liam: I didn't roll any kind of a check, I just got shat upon, but whatever, do your thing. And I walk off.
Travis: I just got shat upon.
Taliesin: I just-- I don't feel the dice were necessary at that point.
Travis: (laughs) Shat upon.
Liam: I do! I do! They're necessary all the time. All the time! Except when it comes--
Travis: Do I?
Liam: --to me. Go, go, do your thing. Do your thing. I'm gone.
Matt: No, you-- Okay. Vax walks away before he finishes his point, and doesn't get to make his roll.
Liam: Yep.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, whatever, Matthew, whatever.
Matt: What?
Liam: What roll?
Matt: All right.
Sam: We'll never know.
Laura: Forgive my brother, he gets very embarrassed when he talks about how much we've saved. Humble creature.
Matt: I'm still very confused here. You're asking for a discount, why? Because the city was saved?
Laura: Oh, well I wasn't, of course not.
Matt: Look, I don't know who you are, I don't know what you're trying to do here--
Travis: We killed all the dragons.
Matt: --but we're in the process of trying to recover the economy of what was once a very strong economy, of a town that has been under attack. Now, we cannot offer discounts to anybody because right now, we're all in financial dire straits.
Laura: Understandable.
Matt: So, if you're going to ship, if you're going to move, if you're going to charter, if you're going to purchase, it's going to have to be the ask--
Laura: We're looking to charter a ship, full of sailors, who can get us to a circular reef to the southwest, near the Hespit.
Matt: Captain Adella. That would be your best bet.
Laura: Captain Adella.
Matt: "Now." And he points off to the end of one of the nearest docks, there's two that are close by, and there's a long row of various ships that are in the process of being loaded and unloaded, but there appears to be one sailing ship. They have some galleys and long-ships along the side, but there's a sailing ship with the sails currently tied up and bound to the mast, and a crew that is lounging on the deck. There is a woman, towards the edge, that's just walking past. You cannot make out a lot of details from this point, but he points over. "That is Captain Adella. She will be able to help you."
Laura: Thank you so much, Dockmaster.
Matt: Of course. Now, if you wish to charter, speak with her. Let her know that the Dockmaster is the one that brought you that point, and all shall be well.
Laura: Wonderful.
Matt: "All right. Good luck, travel safe." And he turns around and walks aw--
Laura: Percy, do we tip him? I don't know how this works.
Taliesin: No, I think we just--
Sam: No, we do not tip him.
Laura: Oh, all right.
Travis: Can I just ask before we leave, how much are the ships that are for sale?
Matt: Oh! Well, it depends on the ship that you are looking for. For a long-ship, no crew of course, which is a fairly decent speed, requires maybe 30 to 40 rowers, and a handful of deck hands, that would run you about 10,000 gold pieces?
Laura: Oh, that's it?
Taliesin: That's a long-ship--
Travis: Just let me ask the important questions, you all retire.
Laura: We don't even need that.
Taliesin: We need a big-- we need a bigger ship.
Travis: If I wanted a ship that had, let's say, this many sails, and came with a crew, how much would that be, about?
Matt: Are you talking about a fully outfitted galleon?
Travis: That.
Taliesin: Yes, yes you are.
Matt: I would put that... well, I mean the crew you'd have to pay whatever they're asking, but for the actual ship, the general asking price can range somewhere in around 30,000 to 40,000 gold pieces.
Travis: 30,000 to 40,000 pieces, that's what I thought. Yep. Thank you.
Matt: Right. Obviously a man of the world.
Taliesin: Do you want a galleon, Grog?
Travis: These dock pretzels are amazing.
Sam: He's literally picking up dried pieces of seagull poop. (all laugh)
Taliesin: There is this thing for seasickness, with seaweed--
Laura: Dock pretzels.
Travis: It's not pretty.
Marisha: Grog, that's-- that's not like free peanuts at the tavern.
Taliesin: That's not-- that's...
Laura: That was so gross.
Travis: Really crunchy.
Marisha: The profile of that.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: There's protein in everything. Everything.
Travis: Well, let's go get a ship.
Laura: Oh my god. Wow. We could seriously buy a ship.
Taliesin: We could, or we could just--
Laura: I mean we have no need for a ship.
Taliesin: What are we going to do when we're done with it?
Laura: I know, right?
Taliesin: I know, really.
Laura: We've gotta be frugal, even though we don't have to be, we should be.
Taliesin: It's not even frugal, this is just what you do once you have money--
Laura: Exactly.
Taliesin: -- you only buy things you need, and just lease everything else. It's very, very common. It's all good.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: This is very true.
Matt: All righty. As you guys walk to the edge of the--
Taliesin: Leasing.
Liam: It's true.
Matt: --aforementioned dock that was pointed out, you come to the outskirts of this larger sailing ship, and as you begin to walk up, and your footfalls 'clack-clack, clack-clack, clack' against the dock, a couple of the deckhands that are kind of leaning off to the side, kind of just looking up, one of them appears to be taking a hit off of a flask of some kind, both hear the footfalls and get up and turn around, spin and look. "Cap'n? Cap'n!" And they kind of point over and the coat-wearing figure that you saw walking across the deck of the ship spins around, and begins to abruptly quicken her pace in the direction of the gangplank that leads off onto the side of the dock. As she comes up to the edge, reaching and grabbing the sides of it, you see before you a woman with long, sea-air tattered mass of hair. It is just this halo of crimped, curled, and wild dark hair that's also been sun-bleached to the point where the tips kinda go light. It is crazed in appearance immediately as she arrives. She looks spry and somewhat young, maybe late 20s early 30s, but her skin has been very heavily weathered from all these days at sea, and you can see already she's getting these crows nests at the corners of her face, but has a very bright smile, and her light brown coat hangs just past her calf-high boots. She looks like the kind of woman who captains a ship. As she glances over, "Hi. You looking for a crew?"
Marisha: You look like a pirate!
Matt: I do not look like a pirate. Why would you say that?
Taliesin: She meant it as a compliment.
Marisha: Where do you buy your clothes?
Matt: Are you looking for a crew or not?
Laura: Why, yes we are! I assume you're Captain Adella.
Matt: Yes. (laughs) I see my reputation precedes me.
Taliesin: By about ten feet.
Laura: Yes, it does. Dockmaster Abban speaks very highly of you. Do you know your way around the Ozmit?
Matt: Quite a bit actually, I do. Where you looking to go?
Laura: Near the Hespit Sea? Near the Hespit? I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Marisha: Yep, that's right. Southwest.
Liam: Hespit-bound.
Laura: Ish.
Matt: No. We don't travel to the Hespit. That's--
Laura: It's near the Hespit, not quite--
Marisha: Have you stumbled upon Vesrah?
Matt: Vesrah, I know of.
Laura: Oh! Perfect.
Matt: I know of it.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Goodness gracious.
Taliesin: We would be excited to make it worth your while.
Matt: How worth your while?
Laura: How worth our while are you thinking?
Taliesin: What is your while worth, I imagine?
Matt: Well, we have a crew here, 12 deckhands, my captaining and navigating skills, a first mate, and the use of the ship... that would run you-- let's put it at 150 gold per day for chartering the ship.
Taliesin: There's six of us and a bear.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: The bear sleeps in jewelry.
Sam: And a robot.
Taliesin: Oh, and a robot. An automaton. Can I say automaton?
Sam: He doesn't eat, it'll be fine.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Well this has certainly got real interesting, didn't it? All right! So, have we a deal?
Taliesin: 150 gold a day?
Liam: That's nothing for us.
Laura: How many crew-- 12-man crew?
Liam: Vex'ahlia. We have so--
Laura: No, I think that's a fair price.
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: She is such not a good negotiator. What is going on?
Liam: Hey, buddy?
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Liam: There's a lot of--
Sam: I will be quiet.
Liam: -- inner working dynamics in this group that you don't know anything about--
Sam: I'll be-- you're right.
Liam: If you'd just wait a bit, all right?
Sam: You're right, I will be quiet.
Liam: That sounds good.
Taliesin: I'm so pleased.
Matt: "Fine. You've found yourself a leader, a captain, and a partner." Shakes your hand. "So."
Travis: Are you all right?
Laura: Honestly, I feel...
Matt: Vesrah, you say? Crazy water folk. Who am I to judge? But yes, six to seven days travel at sea, depending on the weather, of course. Storms are common this time of year, do keep in mind we will be passing north of the Hespit, so be wary of any wandering bandit ships.
Laura: Bandit ships?
Marisha: Not pirates.
Matt: Or pirates, you can call them pirates as well, but we already had that conversation.
Marisha: And you are definitely not--
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: --a pirate.
Matt: Not anymore.
Marisha: Nope. You just look really cool.
Travis: What kinda weapons you got on this ship?
Matt: Oh! We've got some ballistae. We travel with speed.
Travis: Oh. It's a fast ship?
Liam: What d'you mean?
Matt: Fast ship.
Liam: You got-- you got nothing?
Marisha: Oh, we don't need weapons. We're weapons!
Laura: We're weapons.
Taliesin: We're quite fierce.
Marisha: We're the most deadly thing in this land.
Laura: How often do sea monsters sprout up on you? Ever? I've never been on the sea.
Matt: Often enough.
Marisha: Often enough?
Laura: Really?
Liam: We have, we were just way high above it.
Laura: Well yeah, not like in it.
Travis: Oh that's true, we have never been in a boat, yeah.
Taliesin: Actually, that's a good question. How many of us have actually been on a ship before?
Liam: I'm afraid of getting nauseous, actually.
Taliesin: Am I really-- come on.
Sam: I had a boat--
Laura: You own boat shoes.
Sam: I had a boat in one of my larger baths that I would take at night, and it would go on epic adventures through the bubbles! But never quite at sea.
Travis: What was the boat's name?
Sam: The boat was the SS... ... that's it. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Even better than I could have possibly imagined.
Matt: That's adorable. Well, welcome to my ship. She is called the Drensala Vis--
Sam: That's such a cool name.
Liam: Drensala Vis.
Marisha: Drensala Vis.
Liam: Drensala Vis!
Taliesin: The Drensala Vis.
Matt: It is Marquesian for Luck of the Mother.
Taliesin: Mother Lucker.
Liam: Mother Lucker.
Matt: Treat her well and she'll treat you well in kind. Respect my crew, respect my authority, respect our direction, and we'll do just fine. So! To the crazy water people. Welcome on board the Drensala Vis.
Taliesin: Aye, Captain.
Laura: Do we need anything? Do we need anything before we do--
Marisha: Did she just say crazy water people?
Liam: Too many mother luckers!
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: I don't think we need anything. Do we need anything?
Taliesin: I think as long as the ship is prepared and has--
Travis: Anything you can buy on dry land?
Taliesin: --everything stocked, everything it needs, I think we're just reasonable.
Travis: I've got a couple canisters of underwater breathing that nobody else has.
Taliesin: And I have the remnants of several bottles of liquor. I'm quite pleased.
Marisha: I will come stacked with some water-breathing stuff. I think we can do it to eight people for like an hour or something like that?
Travis: There you go.
Liam: That'll help in the middle of the ocean.
Marisha: That'll definitely help.
Laura: Do you think that Raven's Slumber is waterproof?
Matt: You imagine the enchantment probably is waterproof.
Laura: All right. I would hate to-- little baby, mini Trinket in there gets like drowned or something if I'm underwater.
Liam: Yeah. You don't wanna drop the iPhone in the toilet.
Laura: Exactly. Or the bathtub.
Travis: About what time of day is it right now?
Liam: What do you mean?
Matt: Right now, it's a little bit past three o'clock in the afternoon.
Travis: Shouldn't we go out early in the morning?
Taliesin: Why?
Travis: Isn't that what you do? You, like, set sail--
Sam: You can sail all night while we sleep on the ship.
Laura: I wanna sleep on the ship!
Marisha: It's gonna be like a seven-hour trip-- or a seven-day trip.
Taliesin: You're gonna get to sleep on a hammock, Grog.
Liam: You can spend days on a ship.
Taliesin: There'll be a hammock.
Travis: What if it's only a three-hour tour?
Liam: Tary, there wo-- what is that in reference to?
Taliesin: No. I'm not even dignifying that with a groan--
Travis: Come on, Tal, you're with me.
Taliesin: That would not even-- I expect better of you.
Liam: It would make for a good beginning of a chapter to set out at dawn.
Sam: That is true. Poetically it would be nice, but--
Taliesin: He could just write that we set out at dawn.
Sam: I am eager to get my adventuring on, L.E.B., so I am eager to go.
Travis: All right, yeah.
Taliesin: Little elf girl. L.E.B. Little elf boy.
Travis: I'm fine with that.
Marisha: Adella.
Matt: Yes?
Liam: Little elf boy?
Marisha: Oh, been on the sea a little long. Is your crew ready to go? Or would it be better to set sail in the morning?
Matt: Well. We leave at your leisure, but we're not against the idea of a raucous final evening at the local tavern.
Laura: How many beds do you have on that ship?
Sam: You're asking us to get her drunk?
Liam: Well...
Sam: Is that true?
Liam: I mean--
Sam: Is that what's happening?
Liam: We've really been through the shit, so I'm not opposed. Just saying.
Matt: Not including for my crew? we have bunks for at least 15 other passengers.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Bunks? Or rooms? I mean, obviously you don't have rooms for--
Matt: Between the bunks, six rooms.
Liam: How many bunks per room?
Matt: Two or three, depending.
Laura: Oh.
Liam: That's weird.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: No, no. It's quite common.
Laura: No, it's totally doable.
Liam: No, it's weird.
Taliesin: No, it's quite common.
Liam: I disagree.
Taliesin: I think it's perfectly fine.
Liam: Well, you're fucked.
Laura: Let's just go.
Matt: If you don't find--
Liam: Yeah. Fuck it.
Matt: "Good! Grab your things! On this ship! Let's set sail!" Starts giving out orders to her crew, seems to now kind of come to life, and they're starting to go ahead and start pulling up anchor, they're starting to get the sails ready. You already can feel the spray of the water as the tide's coming in now, the water's starting to get a little choppier as it's hitting up against the side of the docks and the shore end.
Sam: A sea voyage. This is unprecedented.
Liam: Oh, jeez.
Sam: Doty, take down every word of anyone saying anything ever on this whole trip. This is amazing. I'm so excited.
Matt: Doty stops for a second, leans back, and then starts scribbling furiously at anything that he can pick up within earshot.
Liam: Tary, staring off into the distance, shat his pants. Crying, into his poo--
Sam: Well, okay, all right, so zing, you got me.
Travis: He pulls out of his waistband-- (all laugh)
Travis: -- and notices the tiny member between his legs.
Sam: You're smarter than I thought, you.
Liam: No, I'm as smart as you thought I was.
Matt: Eventually, the ship disembarks, and begins making its way further out into the water, just as the sun begins to set into the slightly orange, purple, and dark blues of the end of daylight. You can see the various lights in Emon come on, especially towards the dock, as the night comes to life. And out the opposite side, the sparse clouds that are scattered in the distance, the ship picks up the winds and pushes with guiding speed out to the southwest, into the depths of the Ozmit Sea. And that's where we'll pick up next session!
Taliesin: And so--
Marisha: Moana!
Taliesin: As our ship sinks slowly in the west, we bid farewell!
Marisha: It just slowly sinks.
Matt: I finally get to use the ocean voyage audio! (all cheer)
Matt: Had that on my playlist for a long-ass time.
Marisha: Ocean voyage!
Matt: Awesome.
Marisha: We're going on a cruise, you guys!
Matt: That took some interesting turns tonight!
Marisha: Now we learn how shitty cruises are.
Taliesin: I love ships. Ships are great.
Liam: Everybody's vomiting.
Matt: Pretty much.
Taliesin: I think I'm the only character who's spent some time on a boat, at this point.
Marisha: Well, and Pike.
Taliesin: Who's been on a ship. And Pike--
Marisha: Well, Pike's not here--
Liam: I'm on a boat!
Matt: Yeah, Pike's still back at home. Ashley, come back to us!
Laura: I know!
Matt: Blindspot, stop filming! You finished your season, right?
Liam: Almost, almost.
Laura: Almost. So close!
Liam: Getting there.
Matt: We'll get her back. Guys, thank you so much.
Liam: What an episode.
Matt: Ridiculous fucking people.
Marisha: That was so good.
Matt: We're gonna pick up next week, as you head deeper into the Ozmit Sea towards Vesrah. Thank you again Loot Crate for being our awesome sponsors this evening--
All: Lootcrate!
Matt: -- you've been fantastic. The rest of you guys, rest well, sleep well, and is it Thursday yet?
Laura: I'll most likely kill you in the morning.
Matt: Have a good night. [ART]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer, the Dungeon Master and the person unable to find a barber who understands "leave it long." (laughter)
Matt: But that's okay; it'll grow.
Travis: Time jump, backwards.
Liam: You look handsome in any hair.
Matt: It's okay. But anyway, welcome. Before we dive into tonight's episode, in which we have our fantastic Scanlan Shorthalt. "Scanlan Sharthard" would be a much more apt name. Here via satellite. Hi, Sam.
Sam: What's up, guys?
Matt: Glad you could join us.
Liam: Wow, look at all that white and pink.
Laura: He looks like he is in Miami.
Marisha: The white and pink contrasting with the fur is very confusing to my brain.
Liam: (hum "Axel F")
Laura: (hum "Axel F")
Matt: (singing) No one watching is old enough to know what that thing is. Yeah, a few people do. And thank you. I know. All right, so first and foremost, let me get through our announcements real fast. Let's see. We have very few tickets left for the live show at GenCon, which we're excited for next week, guys; it's going to be a lot of fun. We're excited to meet everybody at GenCon. We have our campaign guide debuting there physically at the booth. We have a panel, we have a bunch of fun stuff coming up, so excited to see you guys out there.
Marisha: It's going to be so much fun.
Matt: Let's see. Merch-wise. Laura.
Laura: Hi!
Marisha: Oh man.
Laura: We have something to show you guys. You just wait. Hey guys, why don't you roll that footage?
Matt: "Hello, Tal'Doreians, and we have an exciting new product that we want to share with you today on Gilmore's Glorious QVC. What you see here is a beautiful Major Arcana Tarot Deck featuring some of the most prominent figures of who's-who in picturesque Tal'Dorei. Painted by the brilliant Lady Ioana Muresan, printed on the finest cardstock parchment with glittering gold foil, imported from the mines of Kraghammer. This is truly a showstopper for any high society soiree. You're not just telling their fortunes, you're bedazzling their future. Now, today we're offering this beautiful purple and gold deluxe edition as well as-- that's it, actually. I wouldn't offer any other than the finest edition at my store. The going market retail price is four platinum or 40 gold pieces or 400 silver pieces or 4,000 copper pieces, but today we are giving you the special Gilmore's Glorious QVC value of-- Sherri, no, we're still filming those. Please, you're getting them all smudgy!" (beep)
Matt: "The special Gilmore's Glorious QVC value of 24 gold pieces and 99 copper. That's right! Just two and a half platinum pieces! But that offer only lasts until the disclosed amount of seconds runs out on the timer in the corner. Scry now or come down and visit me, Gilmore, at Gilmore's Glorious Goods in the Abdar's Promenade district of Emon."
Laura: Oh, these tarot cards? Hold on, let me open it up, since you didn't see enough of it in that amazing commercial.
Travis: Oh my god, they're so shiny.
Laura: Liam, tell us about the artist.
Liam: Oh, the artist, Ioana Muresan, who is a long time Critter and has done a lot of art for our show, and we love her, and she did such a amazing job. Thank you. Look at this!
Laura: Go check them out. They're in the store right now. They're amazing. All of the other stuff that we had is still in the store, as well, including this fabulous necklace. And the posters shipped, so get ready to get them. Or maybe they're shipping tomorrow, something like that. I don't remember. But they're going out. And then the aprons are shipping at the end of next week, so you'll be getting those soon, too.
Matt: That new card smell. The gold gilding at the sides is so cool.
Liam: It's got gilding on the sides. Everything shines.
Matt: Gilmore's Glorious Gold Gilding. As a person who enjoys collecting cool major arcana, this makes me so happy.
Travis: Yeah, baby.
Liam: I'm not going to play. I'm just gonna look at these.
Matt: Thank you, Ioana Muresan. Your work is amazing.
Laura: You're amazing.
Matt: All righty. Critical Role podcast up to episode 30 is available. We're working tight on the next batch of ten. Will have announcements very soon for that. Let's see. People who are Alpha users, we have all the back episodes of Critical Role, all the way up from one to 107 available on Alpha. They retroactively added all the bells and whistles, HP trackers, all that fun stuff, conditions, all the little fun things for the entire show. They just finished it. So you have that waiting for you if you ever wanted to binge again.
Liam: They added Horshack back into the cast. That's a reference that nobody in the audience got.
Laura: I don't even understand that reference, bro.
Liam: Yeah, I know how much older than you I am.
Matt: That's okay. Let's see. Do we have a Talks Machina next week?
Taliesin: We do.
Matt: Yes. So we have Talks Machina at 7 00pm next Tuesday, Pacific. We have Brian Foster, who will be returning for the glory. And then I think that's it. I think that's all of our announcements for the evening. That being the case, let's go ahead and pull ourselves in this evening to tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello and welcome back. Goddamn it. (sighs) Welcome back. I'll remember that. Your dungeon master will remember this. So. Last we left off, Vox Machina, in trying to find a way to seal off the growing threat of Vecna, now restored to physical form and seeking ascension and achieving it, you've gone to a number of the deities across the Exandria pantheon of the Prime Gods. Gaining some blessings and gaining bits of essence from these deities to create something called a Prime Trammel, an item that was used previously during the Calamity to seal one of the betrayer gods and could possibly put an end to Vecna's newly ascended form and reign as the only god on the Prime Material plane across the Divine Gate. Information given to you by the Knowing Mistress sent you beneath an underwater volcano known as Scaldseat, where you proceeded to learn how to breathe water and then step into toxic fume-filled tunnels, where you proceeded to breathe through the water via Grog's jug. Very clever. But finding your way through a short battle with some of the indigenous life forms there, a mother and two children magma bulettes. You headed down deeper into the volcanic caverns of Scaldseat, eventually finding a long-sealed series of chambers by the Allhammer, the deity for craft, family, and legacy, where somewhere supposedly beneath this volcano and hopefully within these long-sealed chambers lies the Core Anvil, where these Prime Trammels can be constructed. As you made your way through here, hearing the undulating reverberating pounding of some distant piece of machinery, it seemed, heading down the stairs you were put into a hexagonal chamber which had a square of coals and above that, X bars against the wall where in the center you saw a gold inlaid seal, almost. What's the word I'm looking for? An empty triangular shape, a pyramid inverted within this golden seal. And a series of these iron warriors that were embedded in the walls. Behind the stairway, you saw, and you identified upon seeing it, means of smelting metal and other forms of material. When Percival was inspecting one of these warriors, it immediately came to life, and you watched as the glowing outline of each one of these ten-foot-tall, 12-foot-tall metallic warriors glowed bright orange. They each emerged from the walls with these large two-handed greatswords at their side and immediately began to incite conflict. And that's where we left off, so to begin this fray: Where are you guys placed, currently? Percival, you would probably be right about where that guy emerged.
Taliesin: I would probably be about there.
Laura: You were on the wall.
Taliesin: I had my boots on, so I was up by his face.
Matt: Okay, so we'll put you there. Oh god. Here you go. Grog was by the smelter.
Laura: I feel like I had been looking at the thing. The big empty pyramid triangle thing.
Matt: So you'd be over in this area.
Marisha: I feel like I was with Vex, maybe on the other side. Yeah.
Laura: I was on my broom, because I had been hovering looking at it.
Matt: Fair enough. So you'd probably be about--
Laura: About there, then.
Liam: I know that I had just poofed the wings out and I think I was inspecting one of the big metal men before it came out of the wall. I don't really remember which.
Matt: Most likely one of the ones that was not attended by another member of the party. So we'll say about here. And Scanlan, whereabouts were you?
Sam: You know, near things. Can't really see too well, so put me where-- Let's see. I was at the door when we opened it and then I was beautiful. And now I'm not as beautiful. So put me near the door.
Matt: Near the door? So we'll put you over in this one here.
Taliesin: So all of their faces are indented?
Matt: Yeah, each one of them, as opposed to the other warriors you saw in the chambers that led down into this area, have no faces. Instead where you see are an empty void triangular like the large seal, but vacuous.
Travis: But matches the same shape?
Liam: They didn't Man-E-Faces around? I'm misremembering that? Maybe I just really like Man-E-Faces.
Matt: Which is a good thing. But regardless, I would like you all to roll initiative.
Laura: Not so soon! (grumbling)
Travis: Is their head height about the same height as the seal and the crossbeams?
Matt: The seal is a little bit higher than where their heads are. All right, so 25 to 20.
Laura: 23.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: All right, so we have Grog. 15 to ten?
Sam: 12.
Liam: Oh sorry, I was looking at a book. 18. Sorry.
Matt: All righty. Keyleth, what'd you get?
Marisha: Five. I don't want to talk about it.
Matt: Well, that being the case. As these large metallic warriors are emerging from the sides of the chamber, wrenching the large metal blades, these large rectangular almost slab-like swords, bladed on each side, Vex, you're up first. What are you doing?
Laura: Oh god.
Marisha: What do we do?
Taliesin: What do you do, hot shot?
Laura: I want to attack them. I'm going to attack the one next to Percy. Attack-style. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him and then I'm going to attack him. I'm going to do this, and then this, and then this.
Travis: What are things like this considered? Creatures or golems?
Matt: Constructs.
Laura: God dang it! That was a miss; it was a one. It was a natural one.
Matt: All right, yeah, so you do actually pull back the arrow and it strikes true. However, the armored plating is so strong that the arrow shatters across the front of its armored chest.
Laura: Fuck! I do it again.
Matt: All right, second shot.
Laura: Oh my god. 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Laura: Okay, well that's good. Oh my god, I'm going to scream. Yeah, I know, bro. You're not bro, you're hubby.
Travis: She called me "bro." Game of Thrones is obviously back on the air.
Laura: 14. Don't say other numbers! 14 plus seven is 21. 24.
Matt: 24 points of damage. All righty. And are you going to stay wherever you are, or do you want to move?
Laura: How high is the ceiling?
Matt: The ceiling is about 30 feet up.
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to fly up.
Matt: 25 to 30 feet.
Laura: All right. I'm going to go to the roof.
Matt: Okay. You're going to go all the way up to the roof?
Laura: Oh yeah. Some of that was lightning damage. That was two points of lightning damage. Because they're made of metal. I don't know if that did anything special.
Matt: Okay. Thank you for the heads-up on that. All righty. So ending your turn, that brings us to Vax.
Liam: All right. To start, am I within striking range of him if I back up a little bit?
Matt: If you back up a little bit?
Liam: Yeah. Do I need to disengage?
Matt: You are currently engaged with him.
Liam: Okay, so that I'm that close.
Matt: Yeah. You were inspecting it as he emerged.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: And then I'm going to stick him in the face is what I'm going to do.
Laura: Oh wait, I get 3d6 of sneak attack now?
Matt: If you haven't been marking that, yeah. You should do that.
Laura: An extra four.
Liam: So that's 30 for the first. And for the second. 30 for both.
Matt: 30 for both hits?
Liam: Yeah, because I'm at advantage because I'm going before them.
Matt: Correct. So both hit.
Liam: All right. So the first one, which will get the sneak attack fun, is ten plus psychic damage is 16 plus sneak attack damage. (counting) 38 for the first. Plus Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Plus another d6.
Liam: 44 for the first and for the second is one. That's it. Is one plus the Hunter's Mark again, right?
Laura: Only Hunter's Mark once on your attack.
Liam: So it's only for one attack? Because I don't use it all the time.
Laura: Just kidding. It's Hunter's Mark every time.
Liam: Every time?
Laura: Yeah, no, I know that.
Liam: So five for the second.
Laura: Yeah, sneak attack's only once but Hunter's Mark is every time.
Matt: Yeah, whenever you hit it with a weapon. All right. So what's that second one you said?
Liam: Just five.
Matt: Five? All right. Got it.
Liam: Wait! That's not true, sorry. 11. Because it's not an offhand attack, it's my second paladin attack.
Matt: That's correct. There you go. 11. Boom. All righty. And you're going to stay put, or you're going to move somewhere?
Liam: I'm going to risk an attack while I'm not hasted. I'm going to risk an attack and back up about ten and go up another 15.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Yeah, they can't throw those greatswords, right?
Laura: Don't give him ideas. Stop it.
Marisha: You can't be paralyzed or restrained.
Travis: Helps a lot.
Matt: All righty. So you're also just about at the ceiling with her. As you shoot up and away, it strikes up quickly after your daggers have been carving into its armor. Its blade comes up in a wide arc against you. That is an 18 plus 12. 30.
Liam: 18 plus 12? Just barely hits.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: Wow. Do we still have our Death Ward on?
Matt: You do, yeah.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, thank you for reminding me.
Marisha: And our Heroes' Feast.
Taliesin: We're pretty metal.
Matt: 32 points of slashing damage as the blade rakes across the front of your chest and forces you back even further. Your shoulders end up slamming into the ceiling from the impact of both you retracting back and the blow itself. Your wings have to catch you for a second and you're keeping yourself elevated at the moment. Finishing your turn there. That brings us to Grog.
Travis: Right. Standing by the blacksmithing stuff, I say, you are interrupting Grog's arts and crafts! And I would like to rage.
Matt: All right. Into a rage you go.
Travis: And I would like to charge at that little bastard right there.
Matt: This one here on its own?
Travis: Yes, please.
Matt: Up into his face you go.
Travis: Up into your face!
Laura: Get him, Grog!
Travis: Reckless, regular strike. Not terrible. 29.
Matt: That hits. Roll damage.
Laura: 29 is not terrible. Did you know that?
Travis: Hey, that's good. 28.
Matt: Damage? All right.
Travis: The second one. Reckless, great weapon master.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Just because. That's a million. That's 34 minus five is 29!
Matt: 34 minus five? Nice, that hits!
Travis: Five, nine, 21, 31. 31 points of damage.
Matt: 31 points of damage. Fantastic.
Travis: And that ends my turn.
Matt: All righty. Ending Grog's turn there. Percival?
Taliesin: I'm going to cry out to everyone  we need their heads. Don't hit them in the face, please. I am engaged. I know, there's nothing I can do. I am engaged with that thing, aren't I?
Matt: Currently, yes.
Laura: Maybe he doesn't see you because you're above him.
Matt: You technically triggered it. It's seemingly aware of your presence. In fact, the moment you say that, you watch as the metallic head goes (creak) and looks up right to you, that creepy triangular void staring right at you.
Marisha: Do you think you can dispel their magic?
Taliesin: I don't know. I'm going to try and take a run in the other direction. I know it's going to take a swing at me. Yep, I'm running down the wall.
Matt: This way, to the corner?
Taliesin: Yep, as far as I can go.
Matt: That's about as far as you can get on that wall.
Taliesin: I'll start coming that way, too. Not a full-- it's six spaces., so--
Matt: So at that point you'll be about there. All righty. It does swing at you.
Travis: You'll be fine.
Matt: 19.
Taliesin: 19 just hits.
Matt: 19's your AC?
Taliesin: AC's 18.
Liam: Escher man is down! I love being able to see everything.
Laura: I know!
Matt: 34 points of slashing damage. Which almost cleaves you off the wall.
Taliesin: 34 points? Okay, so hold on, let me do the math on that. (counting) Okay, yeah, I'm at 151 because I had a whole bunch of temporary points.
Matt: As you're running along the wall, it hits you from behind and for a second you feel the urge to black out and you fight through it and keep running. You can feel the warm spreading on the back of your shoulder blades from the blow, and you careen around that corner and stop, spinning to survey the room. What are you doing?
Taliesin: I pull up. I'm going to take my first shot. I'm going to take a straight shot and I'm going to blow a point of grit. We'll get to that, and I'm going to try to get him to drop his sword. First thing is I'm going to try and get him to drop the sword. That's a 34 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Strength save against a 20.
Matt: Okay. That is a 13.
Taliesin: Drop your sword.
Matt: Its sword clangs to the ground as you fire. You see one of its fingers is bent back and busted from the impact and it looks over for a second. You watch as its broken finger (clicks) snaps back into place and it looks back at you.
Taliesin: Okay, so that was shot number one. Oh boy, here we go! I've also got to do damage on that, which is-- I'm so sorry, where are all my dice? There we are. Oh, I didn't do that, so none of that. Where are we going? I'm going to drop three points of Cabal into this, as well. Oh, there we are. Six points of psychic damage, four points of lightning damage, and 16 points of standard piercing damage.
Matt: Got you. And which weapon's this?
Taliesin: Animus.
Matt: Got it. Perfect. All right, so (boom) the finger curls back and breaks into place.
Taliesin: Next thing I'm going to do, I'm going to cast Hex on him. Give him disadvantage on strength saving throws.
Matt: Well, strength ability checks.
Taliesin: Strength ability checks. And I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot. That's 20?
Matt: 20 just barely hits.
Taliesin: Okay, good to know! Making that note. So I'm going to drop three more points of Cabal into that, so that's 20 points of piercing damage, four points of psychic damage, 13 points of lightning damage, and three points of necrotic damage.
Liam: Percy's turned into Rambo.
Matt: Okay. So the second one you watch as one of its armored shoulder plates dents inward from the impact, and there's a small pierced hole in the center where it seems to have blasted through its armor.
Taliesin: And last shot. I'm going to try and push him ten feet back.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Natural 20. (cheering)
Taliesin: Should have done damage. There's no damage on a push shot.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: But he got pushed.
Taliesin: But he got pushed ten feet back. And hey, I get a grit point back.
Travis: Yeah man, when we got pushed in the playground, that got in your head.
Taliesin: So he's got to move ten feet before he can pick up his sword.
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: And that's everything.
Matt: All righty, that ends your turn? All right, it is now their turn. So the one that you just blasted back, as it skids to a halt, almost slams against the wall, it looks over at you across the way and then looks around and surveys the room quickly with its strange triangular vapid lack-of-a-face. Glances up and sees Vex'ahlia on the broom above. Goes into a full leap to push with its feet off the wall and attempt to grab towards you in the middle of the air.
Laura: Oh no. It can jump that high?!
Travis: Like a WWE cage match.
Matt: It's half the size of the room, practically, in height.
Travis: This could be real bad. We might get total-partied right here.
Matt: So I'm making this a grapple check, so roll either acrobatics or athletics.
Travis: Whichever one's better. Acrobatics.
Laura: 25?
Matt: No. 34. (groaning)
Matt: I rolled really high. So as it leaps in the air and grabs you, it drags you off the broom and then basically slam-dunks you into the coals. (crash) Straight over, prone into the coals, landing at the side of them right there. The broom goes clattering off to the side. It's still chained to you from the apparatus that you placed, and it scatters across the stonework a couple of feet from you.
Travis: I thought it was just going to slam you into the ground!
Taliesin: Oh, it's going to hurt!
Matt: You suffer 19 points of bludgeoning damage from the impact.
Taliesin: Remember you have the temporary hit points.
Matt: And then ten points of fire damage from being slammed into the coals. You are considered on fire. You need to take an action to put it out or you take 1d10 damage every turn.
Travis: (singing) You whip your hair back and forth. (screams)
Matt: However, its sword-- and I'll go ahead and use this as a marker-- the sword is on the ground right there. So it can't use that right now. The other two can! So this one over there that got shot by you and flew away, as it arcs up, it's starting to look around to see if it can gain any real intent to go towards you and then glances off to the side and instead sees the smaller targets, the softer, easier-to-get-to druid and gnome.
Liam: What a fool.
Marisha: Bring it, bitch!
Matt: Turns to engage both of you.
Travis: This is the coal pit!
Matt: It's going to stop partway through there, and it's going to go right up there. You watch as underneath the head, the armor part in the chest suddenly hinges open, and you see this bright burning furnace in the center of its chest that (boom) lets out this extremely white-hot burning angry torrent of flame.
Sam: Can I cast Cutting Words, or can I use Cutting Words?
Matt: You can, if you'd like.
Sam: I don't know if it's going to do anything, but sure.
Matt: It can reduce damage. Because Cutting Words can reduce damage on an attack.
Sam: Only by a little. I want him to miss, right?
Matt: Well, it's going to hit regardless. You guys have to make saving throws.
Marisha: It's a cone. It's just going to hit us.
Matt: It would be about there. Get all of you, including the other guy.
Laura: If I'm prone do I still get to roll to roll through the coals to avoid it or some shit?
Liam: Yeah, hide yourself under the coals.
Travis: (laughter) Yeah. Like the McDonald's ball pit.
Matt: You do not get disadvantage on saving throws, so you can still continue to roll. I need Scanlan and Keyleth and Vex to all make dexterity saving throws, please.
Marisha: There's a hypodermic needle in here!
Travis: Oh god, yeah.
Taliesin: How very Santa Monica.
Marisha: Sorry, keep hitting the mic. Just dex saving throws?
Marisha: (groaning)
Taliesin: (groaning)
Sam: Wait, are you pointing to me? Oh! I have this dice. It's the first time I've ever used it. It has poop on it; someone sent me poop dice, and I think I just rolled a natural 20 because I rolled the poop.
Matt: What's on the other side of the poop?
Sam: The other side is a skull.
Travis: So that's a one, right?
Laura: I think for you, you count the poop as a 20.
Sam: Is poop 20 or is poop one?
Laura: I think poop is normally one.
Matt: What's next to the poop? What other numbers are near it?
Sam: 19, 13, and seven.
Matt: No, that's a one. Two ones on that!
Laura: You got a one, as well?
Marisha: No, I rolled a three, so I'm at seven.
Matt: Yeah, so Keyleth and Scanlan, you both from the chest furnace take 38 point of fire damage as it burns out in front of it. You take half that.
Laura: Okay. Which is what?
Matt: It's 19 points of fire damage to you. And the flames burn across the other armored individual, the giant construct, and you watch as some of its damaged form begins to seal up from the flames.
Laura: Flames help it. Fire heals them. Cold damage. Do cold damage!
Travis: Fire bad!
Taliesin: Fire good!
Travis: Is good?
Marisha: You said minus 38, right?
Matt: So that's going to end its turn. The chest slams shut now and the flames retract back inside, and you watch it exhaust smoke out each sides of its armor, and the flames that you saw burning in there are now dimmed, but beginning to flare up again. The one that's by you, Grog, is going to go ahead and move adjacently. Its head spins around for a second to look up at you and then it spins back to you, it's going to make two strikes at you with its greatsword. It has advantage on you because you used reckless.
Travis: Yes, it does.
Matt: All right. That is 31.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: That is 30.
Travis: 30 points of damage.
Matt: No, that's two attacks.
Travis: Oh yeah, they both hit. Of course.
Matt: Okay. So for these, 33 points of slashing damage, reduced to half.
Travis: What is that?
Matt: So that's 16? Right? Yeah.
Laura: 31 divided by two? Yeah.
Matt: Well it's 33 divided by two. And then the other one is another 34.
Travis: Damn!
Matt: So there you go. Round down, so 16 points of slashing damage. So that's going to end its turn there. All right, bringing us to Scanlan. Your turn.
Laura: Do something amazing.
Sam: I'm on vacation, so nothing's going to be amazing. Is the sword still on the ground?
Matt: It is.
Sam: Is it near me?
Matt: It's about 25 feet from you.
Sam: Okay, I will cast Bigby's Hand! And I will pick up the sword and I will use it to hit not the guy whose sword it was, but the guy closest to me.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: They're technically both equidistant from you.
Sam: Okay. Doesn't matter. I want the guy who hit me.
Matt: Okay, so you can move Bigby's Hand. I'll see how many feet it can move, because it'll pick up the sword, I don't know if it can--
Sam: It can move 60 feet.
Matt: It can move 60 feet? Okay then! Then yes, it definitely can. It darts over to the guy who hit you with the flames, so go ahead and make your attack. I'll say for the purposes of this, I'll add an additional d12 slashing damage to its strike.
Sam: I got an 18. Plus something; I don't know.
Matt: 18 to roll for its attack, plus your spell attack, so that definitely hits.
Sam: Oh, plus 11. Yeah, that's huge. Is this a sword attack, or is this Bigby's Hand's clenched fist attack?
Matt: I'm making it a clenched fist attack, so it's 4d8 force damage from adding an additional d12 slashing because it's wielding a sword while it does it, because that's cool.
Sam: That's cool. Okay, I love you, and thank you. So I roll 4d8. Cool. Oh wait, wrong one.
Matt: 4d8 plus 1d12.
Sam: 4d8, 17 plus 12, 29.
Laura: Well, plus a 1d12.
Matt: Plus you have to roll a d12.
Sam: Oh! Sorry, thank you. Then it's 17 plus seven.
Matt: Okay. 24 points of damage to him. All right, perfect. So the fist comes by and slams into it. The sword arcs through its armor and you watch some of the plates separate a bit, but it's still holding itself in place. That's your action?
Sam: Oh, I get a bonus. I will inspire Keyleth. I guess. Not that she needs any help; she's so fricking powerful, but I will inspire Keyleth by singing (singing) Your Minxie brings all the boys to the yard and they're like, it's better than yours, damn right, it's better than yours, you can teach them, but you'd have to "chorge?" (speaking) I don't know.
Matt: Take a d12 "chorge" die. All right. And do you want to move at all?
Sam: I'm close to a guy who's going to hit me if I move, right?
Matt: You're not currently in melee with a guy yet, but you're on the outside of melee with two guys.
Sam: Then I will move dead center on the board.
Matt: All right, so you're going to move back up the stairs a bit, then. You'll be here. That ends your turn, Scanlan. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Do you need help off the coals?
Laura: I'll figure it out.
Marisha: You're fine, right? Okay. I am going to turn and do a Tidal Wave against this guy in front of me, so he has to make a dexterity saving throw. Tidal Wave.
Matt: Pull this up real fast.
Travis: Away, the guy behind you or the one across the pit?
Taliesin: The one closest to us, or the one on the other side?
Marisha: Let me see. (counting) I don't think I can hit both of them with most of my stuff.
Laura: Can you hit the two that are by us?
Marisha: I can, but I think it'd also hit you. It's a straight line.
Laura: How much damage is it?
Marisha: 4d8 bludgeoning.
Laura: Put me out, I wouldn't be on fire anymore.
Matt: You can do it in a way that would probably hit both of them, but it would probably hit her, as well.
Laura: Do it!
Marisha: Are we concerned about me extinguishing these coals? We can light coals again, right?
Laura: Unless they're magic.
Travis: I have made fire.
Marisha: Okay, cool, then with permission from Vex, I'll put you out! And then I'll step out of the way.
Laura: Maybe it'll push me out of the coals.
Travis: It's going to turn this room into a sauna.
Marisha: Yes! I'm turning into a sauna! I'm going to hit that and go (boom).
Matt: All right, so it slams across them. All right, dexterity saving throw for Vex and both of them.
Liam: This combat just got a lot sexier.
Matt: (laughs) 18 and a nine.
Marisha: Fail. Both of them.
Laura: Oh, do I roll a dexterity save, too?
Matt: You do.
Laura: I think I fail it. Oh no. 16, fail.
Matt: Knocked prone, knocked prone. Okay yeah, so you take the full damage, as well, but you are no longer on fire.
Laura: Yay! Did I get pushed out of the coals from the water?
Matt: No, but the coals are no longer burning, so it's not a huge deal, at least that edge of it isn't.
Marisha: So they take 19 damage, they're knocked prone, and the water extinguishes all unprotected flames.
Matt: So as this giant column of flame roars up, you watch as one of the constructs disappears into the water and gets slammed into the wall, (sloshing) over the coals, temporarily douses you, flames go out but you get battered around briefly by the other guy behind you, both of your forms crash into each other. He falls onto his back and as the water subsides steam fills the room now, visibility is now limited.
Marisha: Like a fog cloud?
Matt: Yeah. Everybody in here for the most part, unless you're directly in melee range, you're at partial cover.
Laura: Is it up through, all the way to the ceiling?
Matt: Yeah, it only lasts a round or so, then it'll dissipate. But for the next round or so there's partial cover for anybody not directly in melee.
Marisha: Partial cover? So it works both ways.
Matt: Yeah. Against them and you.
Travis: As if Vax needed any other reason to hide.
Marisha: I can feel the chat saying "Thanks Keyleth." I can feel it!
Laura: You know what? Seriously though, thanks Keyleth.
Matt: Are you going to stay where you are?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. We're at the top, Vex, you're up.
Marisha: No, wait! I'm going to take my bonus action to go water elemental. And then I can still move, right? Can I then move my water elemental into this guy's space and as part of my elemental form I can move into spaces that are within an inch.
Matt: Yeah. That'll do.
Marisha: Can I enter a hostile creature's space?
Matt: Yeah. Perfect. All righty. That ends your turn. Vex, now it's your turn.
Laura: Okay, so I'm going to stand up.
Matt: You get up, (groans). The flames are gone. You're still aching from being slammed so heavily into the coals there and you can look down, you can see beneath the water that has turned to steam and is dissipating on the middle of the hot metal floors of this room. The construct is still thrashing and about to get its way back up. What are you doing?
Laura: I can see him good enough though to shoot him?
Matt: Oh yeah, he's right there.
Laura: Am I at disadvantage because he's prone, but he's right there?
Matt: You're at disadvantage both because prone and you guys are in melee. You can back up if you want to to try, I mean unfortunately because he's on the ground and it's a ranged weapon, it's still disadvantage. It's nothing to do with the weapon, it's the fact that he's on the ground, prone.
Taliesin: Oh it's on the ground, okay.
Laura: Okay well I'm going to back up, because he can't take a strike at me, right?
Matt: He can take a swing at you, but it'll be his fists.
Laura: I'm going to back towards the stairs where Scanlan is.
Matt: So you're back up towards the stairway there. It does get one swing at you, no he already got-- no, because your turn is before his, so he does have his reaction. So he swings out with a fist at you, that is a 21.
Sam: I will Cutting Words that.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Thanks, Scanlan!
Matt: Well, what are your Cutting Words to him?
Sam: Oh. I'm going to quote from some old TV show and say: you are a monstrous mechanised misguided moron! That's it.
Matt: Very nice. Go ahead and roll a d12.
Travis: I don't know that TV show.
Taliesin: I think it's Lost in Space.
Sam: Correct, Taliesin Jaffe! Oh shit, I only rolled a three.
Laura: Does that Cutting Words him down to 19 or 18?
Matt: Yeah, that brings him down to an 18.
Laura: Then he doesn't hit me.
Matt: As the fist swings wide, the words seem to strangely cut through to what element of an ego this charisma-one creature has and slams into the metal, causing this large, heavy knuckle punch to the ground as it resounds with this heavy (clang) that shakes the ground. Vex, you manage to move by without issue.
Laura: Great! I think I'm going to then try to attack him.
Matt: Go for it. Two attacks with disadvantage.
Laura: Okay. Ugh, natural 20 was one of them. 30 is the first attack.
Travis: It's 20 and an 18, that's pretty good.
Matt: Actually, it's an interesting point, the prone. An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within five feet of the creature.
Laura: Oh, so if I hadn't moved away I would have been okay?
Matt: Possibly. It's still ranged; you'd be at disadvantage for ranged in melee, so would have been a regular attack.
Laura: Yeah, so it's not cancelled out, if I hadn't moved it would have been, never mind. We'll just fucking say it's fine, because then I'm going to wish I had that crit I just got. So 30 was the attack roll. Okay. (groans) Okay, that is 13, 14, 15. 15 plus one lightning damage. Plus six sneak-- no sneak attack, just kidding.
Travis: Did you Hunter's Mark him?
Laura: There's the Hunter's Mark. Five Hunter's Mark. That's the first attack, and the second attack at disadvantage is 19?
Matt: 19 just misses. Hits the armor, (crash) shatters across it.
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: Is that your turn?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Vax.
Liam: All right, I want to slam down right--
Laura: Sorry, can I use my bonus to hide behind one of those pillars?
Matt: Sure, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Laura: 16.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: It's foggy in this room!
Travis: Vax!
Liam: Yes, all right, slam down right by that one's head, straight down to the ground, take a split-second to look up at the watery druid, shake my fucking head, stab, stab right into its face. Yeah. Okay, so the first one is a 33.
Matt: 33 hits.
Liam: Yeah, and the second one is 28.
Matt: 28 hits.
Liam: All right. So he's prone; he's at disadvantage. I'm going to dump Smite into both of these. Yeah! (counting) 36 plus the Smite, which is 32, 39 for the first, and then for the second hit is two, six, eight, plus the Smite, eight, ten, 12.
Matt: Total damage? All right, so as you slam down the first strike, you jam it right into the chest, and as you pull back the blade you watch as one of the chest armor pieces flips open and the flames, the furnace of its chest that are starting to burn in again begin to fill with the water from the water elemental, and more steam emerges from it. As it's starting to feel the furnace burn out, you reach in with your dagger and find a cool spot and jam it right in the middle where you see one of the embers is the brightest and as your hand goes in and strikes it, the ember goes dark and immediately the creature falls limp there.
Liam: Then, so with the way Hunter's Mark works is I can move it to another as a bonus action? Can I get it over to the one by Grog?
Matt: What's the range on it?
Liam: Oh jeez. 90 feet. Okay, so I should have a little bit of movement left, so I'm going to shoot back up, high-five my girlfriend on the way, and go as high as I can in the room.
Marisha: It goes (splat).
Matt: Yeah, it's like punching a fire hydrant. All right, so you're going to head over this way.
Liam: I'm only 60 feet because I'm not hasted wings.
Matt: Right, but this also is a small area, so between here, it's almost 30 feet there and then 30 feet up, so you'd probably be closer to here.
Liam: Okay. Awesome.
Matt: Yeah, there you go. That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: All right, this guy can obviously play heavy. Reckless, great weapon master, can I make the first attack, I'm going to try for the first time--
Matt: And remember this round, don't forget your retaliation ability.
Travis: Yeah, right.
Matt: You forget it a lot.
Travis: I do, I know. I'm sorry, I get confused! I'm going to try a trip attack with my new maneuvers. It's a d8, right, that's added--
Matt: To the damage, but you still have to roll to hit first.
Travis: Okay. Reckless, great weapon master! 30 minus five is 25.
Matt: 25 hits, yeah.
Travis: So 11, 27, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.
Laura: 41!
Matt: 41 points of damage to it!
Travis: And he's tripped. Oh, he has to make a strength saving throw.
Matt: Correct. He actually got a 15, and your DC for your abilities-- do you have that figured out? You should have that figured out. It's eight plus your strength modifier plus your proficiency bonus. You're way over.
Travis: Oh! Okay, cool.
Matt: So six plus eight. It's 14 plus your strength bonus, which is I believe eight, yeah.
Travis: 26.
Matt: No, not 26, it's 14 plus eight.
Travis: 76.
Matt: Yeah. Sure. So with that, first you knock it prone onto the ground, tripping out from under itself as you sweep across its legs, you watch as one of the pauldrons that's built into its leg splinters off, and you can see the inner mechanisms of the construct's leg. What do you want to do for your second attack?
Travis: I want to hit it again! Reckless, great weapon master. Thank god for that. Seven. Shit, that might not be so good. 20.
Matt: 20 just barely hits.
Travis: Oh, it hits. Okay. One, seven, 17! Oh, 17 plus ten, so 27.
Matt: You're in melee, too, so the reduce his ability doesn't really affect you since you're right up against him. How much was that damage total?
Travis: 27.
Matt: 27 points. Okay. As you swipe it from under the ground and it falls onto its back, it slams, hits the ground with a hard metallic (clang). Using that momentum you swing back, (wham) and slam down on top of its chest, which caves in briefly, you can see bits of the flame of the interior furnace flickering around the edges where the metal's now crinkled inward, exposing the burning flame. Is that your turn?
Travis: Can I spend an action surge to do one more strike into his Gallagher-afflicted chest. Reckless, great weapon master! That's a lot. 16, 20, 34, 29.
Matt: 29 hits. Roll damage. You have two more attacks with your action surge.
Travis: Oh shit!
Laura: It's just another attack.
Taliesin: Welcome to my world, man.
Travis: 21, 31.
Matt: 31 hits.
Travis: Nice. No, 29 was the hit, and 31 was the damage.
Matt: 31 was the damage?! Okay, so as you pull your weapon up from that first impact, seeing the damage it's done, you grin and you feel the veins bulge once more in your neck and you bring it up a third time for this one, slamming it down, the chest caves in entirely and you watch it fall limp as its arms detach and fall to the side. It's done. You still have one more attack, and you haven't moved.
Travis: Can I turn (cracking) to my right in my rage and start running across the room to Old Stupid Butt on the wall? 50 feet.
Laura: Oh, you got to it!
Travis: Last one! Reckless, great weapon master!
Matt: (laughter) Okay!
Travis: That's a million. 35, 30?
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Travis: Okay. Five, 21, 31.
Laura: It's so good when they're within range of Grog.
Matt: Yeah. All righty. That ends your turn, Grog. That brings us to Percival.
Taliesin: I'm going to spend a point of dead-eye to that last one that's on the ground, and I think that cancels out the disadvantage. Yeah, let's just shoot him. Yeah, that's a 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Taliesin: That's ten points of damage, two points of necrotic, two points of psychic. And do the same. That's 32.
Matt: That hits. (groaning)
Taliesin: What a senseless waste of human life.
Laura: The tarot cards!
Liam: The tarot cards!
Taliesin: Tarot cards are fine!
Marisha: They're actually fine. They were on the box.
Matt: Just let me know what magical items you need me to re-print out for you.
Taliesin: All of them!
Marisha: And your new dice box.
Laura: Can we get some paper towels?
Liam: Ten points of coffee damage.
Taliesin: Ten points of coffee damage.
Laura: It may have landed on some wires.
Taliesin: That's nine points of normal damage, two points of psychic damage, six points of necrotic.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Somebody's running now. Soon as we said wires.
Taliesin: And for my third shot. That's 30 points.
Matt: That hits, yeah.
Taliesin: That's 17 points of normal damage, four points of necrotic, one point of psychic.
Matt: Okay. So after Grog rushed up and slammed in this one's chest, he pulls back and actually pulls the armored chest plate that retains the furnace in the inside off. It's still wedged on the axe. And as it pulls open you see the flame begin to spark and billow out of the chest. How do you want to do this? (shouting)
Travis: You are frenzied raging right now.
Taliesin: I want to pour a cup of coffee-- (laughter)
Marisha: Morning traffic Percy's like (groaning).
Taliesin: I'm going to sit. I've already got him, second time I'm going to find very carefully every little crack, and I'm going to get him in there. I'm going to listen to them bang around on the interior. I'm going to rattle them around.
Matt: You hear the ricochet on the inside (clanging), as it does, the flicker burns really bright, you can feel it almost burns into your beard but you pull away real fast, almost like looking out of the trap in Ghostbusters. So you turn away. The flames (crackle) burn upward and then immediately go dark afterward, it falls and collapses to the ground there, unmoving.
Travis: I looked in the trap, Ray.
Marisha: Ugh, no!
Taliesin: It's going to be fine.
Laura: The worst. It's seriously under the box though, on the wires.
Liam: But coffee and Wyrmwood are the two best things, so you're mixing the two best things. (yelling)
Laura: It's everywhere!
Taliesin: Holy cow. I have a coffee problem.
Matt: The coffee-pocalypse has come to Critical Role this night.
Travis: That's an eight-ounce cup. It's a normal cup of coffee.
Taliesin: You would think, and I've been drinking it all night.
Laura: How is there so much coffee?!
Taliesin: I don't know!
Travis: You can caffeinate half of Burbank right there.
Taliesin: Ignore me.
Matt: It's hard to. So. As you all take a moment to look around, you can see that these three warriors now lie broken and destroyed on the ground. Whether it be drowned, torn apart internally, or bludgeoned in the center of their chest cavity, they are no longer moving. You still, now in the quiet, hear the rhythmic (steady banging) that's been perpetually feeding into the distant background of this entire structure deep beneath the volcano. What do you want to do?
Travis: Can I look at the golem, the construct that's down by me? Is his face, the triangle face, is it detachable? Can I remove it from the rest of his person?
Taliesin: We can always put it underneath the smelter and pour in.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Hold onto your butts. That's a one.
Matt: There's no button for it. There's the old fashioned way.
Liam: I'm going to land down next to the other one and start looking in the same fashion. Across the room.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Travis: And I will do it the old fashioned way.
Matt: So make a strength check, please.
Liam: 27.
Matt: Like most of its armored pieces, the arms detach, but the head is a solid jointed portion to the torso.
Travis: 22.
Matt: 22. And as you're inspecting this, you hear this horrible (clanging) sound in the distance as you see Grog with his foot up on the center of the armored clavicle piece, yanks the head off of it, tearing, causing the metal to bend back and spring for a moment in the air.
Travis: Look, it's just like the one above the coals!
Liam: Oh, that's how you do it.
Laura: Good job, Grog.
Taliesin: We've got to do all three heads.
Travis: That's an interesting phrase.
Laura: See if you can smelt some platinum into that thing, Grog. Should it be platinum? Should probably be platinum, yeah?
Taliesin: We have the platinum. Let's see what happens. Let's smelt the platinum into the heads.
Laura: You know how to do it, because you're a blacksmith now.
Travis: We're not supposed to like, kissy-face the heads to make some sort of a 3D shape?
Laura: No, it's already got a pyramid in it.
Travis: Good deal.
Taliesin: I think we're going to put all three into the one.
Travis: Sounds like a plan. Can I go over and archaically remove the other two noggins?
Matt: Sure.
Sam: May I assist by holding the bodies with Bigby's Hand while you pull the heads?
Matt: Yes, actually. Make a strength check with advantage, Grog.
Travis: 23.
Matt: Yeah, so with Bigby's Hand wrapping around the body, clutching it like an action figure, you very easily (crack) pop the head off, and you now have two disembodied heads.
Travis: One more. Do you want to help me with this one, too? Yeah! What's wrong with your voice? 18.
Matt: 18. (groaning) It takes a little while, and it pulls off, but it's mildly deformed from being pulled off. It seems like the hole in the face is intact. It took so hard a try.
Travis: We got the ashtrays.
Taliesin: That'll do. Let's try this.
Travis: All right. We head over to the smelting apparati.
Matt: Okay. So you walk on over, and it's a small furnace built in there with extremely hot coals, and it seems to be an influx of perpetual heat, but there's a large bellows next to it that you can use to try and increase the heat there for a temporary, short time, and you once again, strangely, you look over to it and you know exactly how this works, like you've always worked with it before. So the flames that were a burning orange-red, extremely hot, begin to flare into bright yellow and white in places. And the heat emanating from it is enough that it causes a lot of you to get uncomfortable in the presence and you have to take a step back, Grog enduring it.
Marisha: I'm still a fire hydrant. Keyleth is on fire marshal duty. I do some misting, like at Six Flags to cool off Vex.
Travis: You can't just run through you, like Universal City Walk or something?
Marisha: Yeah. Mainly just to make Vex sexy. That's really all I'm going for. I turned into an elemental. I've got to do something with it.
Matt: Make a check with your blacksmithing tools, which is your proficiency modifier, and we'll say for this, because it is more of a dextrous use of this skill, add your dexterity modifier.
Travis: Okay. 24.
Matt: 24. So in setting up preparation, you take each one of the heads, and to fill each one of their-- I want to say concave, but it's an interior pyramid space. Convex is outward. It will be about 100 platinum pieces or so to fill each face void. So you take the platinum, you melt it down into the smelter, get it to where it's in the gripped, tong-held metallic reservoir, until it eventually melts down. You then pour it into each of the heads, so 300 platinum utilized to do this. It fills to the very edge. Some of it spills over, but you can easily snip that off. As you wait for it to cool, which you can probably help with, actually, as there is no basin for quenching the metal at the moment, so the steam (whoosh) rises up all around, and you turn the heads over, and each one (sliding sound) leaves these heavy metallic pyramid pieces that are smooth and perfect on three of the sides, and one of them appears to be almost like a broken crystal on the inside. It's a shattered, messed-up section.
Laura: Puzzle piece! Got to fit them together!
Taliesin: Okay, so if we fit these together--
Matt: They seem to fit together very well; you figured it out very quickly, they fit and hold together.
Laura: With the jaggedy ends, or with the smooth ends?
Matt: The jaggedy ends all fit together.
Taliesin: Does this now make another concave piece?
Matt: All together, it makes a pyramid that comes to a central point.
Laura: (shouting) Let's put it in the big thing!
Taliesin: So I've still got some Spider Climb, so I'm going to grab one and lift up. All the fliers?
Laura: Yep. Let's go.
Matt: Okay. So the three of you make it up, fit it together, push it in. It fits in perfectly. Slips in. You all back up... nothing.
Laura: We push it in harder.
Matt: All right, make a strength check.
Laura: This is definitely going to be really good.
Liam: I push on my sister's shoulder blades.
Laura: 15.
Laura: (groaning)
Liam: (groaning)
Matt: Right, you guys (groans) get behind and shove, push. Nothing.
Travis: Can I try?
Laura: Yeah. Grog, you try.
Travis: I run across the coal pits and Superman punch the pyramid.
Liam: I barrel-roll out of the way.
Travis: I rage before I do this.
Laura: Oh Jesus. There's a dent in it now.
Matt: You get advantage on this, then.
Travis: That's what I was hoping for. 21.
Matt: (impact noise) The impact on this causes the whole room to shake almost, from the blast. You hear the echo right up the stairs in the hallway that you emerged from, you can hear continuing as it slowly dissipates in the distance. You land, and you can see there's actually a knuckle mark in the platinum from the impact. No effect.
Laura: Hey, I've got an idea. What if we take this thing off of the cross beams, right? And stick it in the coals, or something. Because why are the coals here, right underneath it?
Marisha: I drop water elemental form. You think it needs to be hot first?
Laura: I don't know.
Marisha: I look up, I line up the apparatus and look across the room, does it feel like there's any other Indiana Jones--
Matt: The stairway is in the way. Because the stairway doesn't come all the way to the top of the ceiling, and then back here it blocks this passage between the two of them, but as you go and look, all it is is the reddish, rust colored cross-beams that are bolted against the wall, and in the center there's the round golden crest with the triangle shape which is now filled with the platinum key that you've made.
Taliesin: Are the coals hot or are the coals cold?
Matt: The coals are currently now cold.
Travis: Should we try turning it?
Laura: Oh yeah, good idea! But we should reignite these coals, because I think it's bad that they've burned down right now.
Marisha: I think so, too. Just to test, yeah, I'm going to do Burning Hands. How quickly do they catch?
Matt: Pretty quickly. And you get the sense that they were slowly catching, anyway; there's something about them, the heat that the general room perpetually emanates maintains the fires within. But your flame with the burning hands very quickly elevates and quickens that process, and you watch as the coals now glow to a bright orange-red hue, and you can feel the heat emanating from them.
Laura: Can we turn the circle? Does it move?
Matt: So you go up to the edge and you grab the edge of the golden crest and tug! And it's not moving.
Laura: Gosh darn it! What are we supposed to do?
Marisha: Are there any inlays?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: Okay. It's not my strong point. Goddamn it, that's like the fourth three I've rolled today.
Sam: Hey, you're inspired.
Matt: (laughter) You are inspired. Up to you.
Marisha: Better. 12.
Matt: 12. It's smooth gold, there's no signs or runes or anything on the side.
Taliesin: I want to see if there's anything in the holes that were left by the soldiers who left.
Matt: What was that?
Taliesin: The three suits of armor came out of the wall, so there's now a wall that we haven't seen behind them.
Laura: Maybe it's supposed to be gold.
Marisha: Platinum is for the trammels.
Matt: Okay. So you go ahead and look inside which one?
Taliesin: I'm going to do all three, but I'll start on the one on the left.
Matt: Okay, roll an investigation check.
Taliesin: That's investigation check. What did you do? Six.
Marisha: Is that also a three?
Taliesin: Yeah, it's also a three.
Matt: You look around inside and the shape is a perfect indentation of the physical form of the three metal warriors. You don't see any signs of anything beyond enough of a cavity to fit them snugly when they're dormant.
Liam: Hey Scanlan? You want to use your dragon fisting friend to put that pyramid in the coals and heat it up and then shove it back in?
Sam: Wait, what?
Liam: Do you want to use Bigby's Hand to take that pyramid, shove it in the coals, heat it up, and see if that makes a difference, shove it back in hot?
Sam: So you want me to heat the platinum and then shove into the guy's face?
Matt: Bigby's Hand, by the way, at this time has faded. It only lasts for a minute with concentration. The spell has faded.
Liam: Well, maybe the pyramid heated up could make a difference.
Travis: All right, I walk up into the coals, take the platinum pyramid out, and I'll drop it down into the coals.
Matt: Okay, it's about 15 feet up off the ground.
Travis: Shit. Can I jump, Boots of Feral Leaping?
Matt: You can. I'd say you leap up and grab the edges of the seal with your giant strength, and wedge your fingers in the side and pull it out and land on the coals. You do take four points of fire damage as the coals begin to burn into your feet and the proximity of the heat. But you back up out of the coal based center now holding the key.
Travis: I drop it in the coals.
Matt: Okay, the three pieces come apart as soon as you pull it from the section, so you have the three different pieces right there in your arms.
Taliesin: So when three pieces go together the part that goes towards the wall--
Matt: It's another point. It's like a four-sided pyramid.
Taliesin: All right, it is a pyramid, so the whole pyramid goes in the wall.
Matt: Yeah, it's a flat seal on the outside.
Laura: I think this needs to be gold, dear.
Taliesin: Why would it be gold?
Laura: Well, the outside is gold.
Taliesin: That's true.
Marisha: Maybe the platinum is only for the trammels, not the key.
Laura: We can try it. We have gold.
Liam: Finish my stupid idea, and then we'll move onto the next stupid one.
Laura: Good call.
Travis: Has the platinum pyramid started to heat up yet?
Matt: You're holding it in your arms.
Travis: I drop it in the coals.
Matt: Okay. You drop it in the coals. You wait about five minutes or so, and you can see a faint bit of heated glow slowly heating up, but these coals are not smelter ready.
Travis: You know what, I feel like, I feel like, this is stupid. I pick them up. (pained gasps) Tell me where they go
Matt: Okay, make an intelligence check, Grog, to assemble the three puzzle pieces of the key.
Travis: Negative two. Nine.
Matt: (laughs) He's having a hard time putting those pieces together, guys!
Liam: I fly over, I'm Deathwalker's Warded to fire and I'm going to start helping.
Matt: All right. You each take five points of fire damage just helping touch and assemble this key. Once you get it put together you hold it in the grasp of your hands. You leap using the Boots of Feral Leaping, jam it back inside. Land off to the side. Nothing.
Travis: Asshole! Son of a bitch!
Laura: We got to fucking try it in gold! Try it in gold. Maybe try it in gold.
Taliesin: I have one other thought.
Sam: What?
Laura: What is it?
Taliesin: What's the red armor made out of?
Laura: (gasps) What are the armors made out of?
Matt: It's a dark, reddish-black metal.
Laura: Can we melt the golems into their heads?
Travis: What?
Laura: Melt each one. Maybe it's got to be the metal they're made out of.
Travis: The triangles are like this big and the armor is like massive.
Laura: Yeah, so take some of the metal and melt it down into the head.
Marisha: What is the metal? Can we do a check to see what kind of metal it is, what it's made out of?
Matt: Either of these guys can attempt to do that.
Taliesin: I can take a look. What would that be?
Matt: This would be an intelligence check plus your tinkering benefit, intelligence check plus your blacksmithing proficiency modifier.
Taliesin: So that's intelligence plus my normal tinker check?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: So that's not bad. Let's see.
Travis: 19.
Taliesin: Oh wow! That's 32.
Matt: Okay. So both of you say out loud at the same time, "Oh, this is volcanic glass metal."
Taliesin: Volcanic glass metal. Aha!
Travis: Volcanic glass metal. Aha!
Laura: So maybe can we melt it?
Taliesin: Only in a glass volcano. No, I think it will melt.
Travis: Do I know if volcanic--
Matt: Yeah, it's a--
Travis: It's--
Matt: (laughs) It's a type of metal--
Travis: It's a type of metal--
Matt: You're following me on this?
Travis: Yeah, I'm following you on it.
Matt: Okay, it's an oxidized red iron base that in the construct and the folding of the metal, to build the actual armored structure of these creatures, had bits of volcanic glass folded into the actual metal as it was created.
Laura: I feel like that makes it special.
Travis: (laughs) Bring on the Night King.
Taliesin: We can give it a shot, can't we?
Travis: Melt them down into each of the three.
Liam: Why don't you make their dreams come true and rip their groins off?
Laura: Melt their body into their face and make triangles out of the metal.
Matt: Okay, so because you rolled a very high check, I'll let you know, that generally heating up a metal to the point in which it's liquid and then pouring it into the same metal is going to mess up the mold.
Taliesin: That's a terrible idea. Let's try gold. I would have felt very foolish.
Laura: You guys are so smart about this stuff, then we should do gold.
Travis: It comes, it comes in waves. It's like a new awakening.
Taliesin: We'll try the gold.
Matt: Okay, so about a hundred gold pieces per head. So 300 gold pieces removed.
Laura: Wait, how come it was 300? Oh, it's not the same worth, it's the coin.
Matt: Well, it's a hundred gold pieces per face. So it's 300 gold pieces total. So 300 gold taken off, total. You smelt it down, same process, and then place within each of the three molds, wait for it to cool and then you remove the three key pieces of the solid gold. They all fit together just as the platinum pieces did.
Travis: Can somebody go pull that thing out, and then I will put this one in?
Taliesin: I'm pulling it out.
Matt: Okay, so you go ahead and you pull out the chunks of heated, now cooling platinum and drop them into the coals for a moment. You pull them off the coals, carefully.
Travis: Can I run up and MJ the new gold pyramid into the--?
Matt: Sure, make an intelligence check.
Travis: An intelligence check? Oh, because I got to put them together. Two!
Matt: Grog is having a hard time with that. Okay.
Travis: I'm making an origami swan.
Matt: (laughs) All right, you guys eventually help him put it together a second time.
Liam: That is a really good macaroni art you've made. It's so good. That's a boat, right?
Laura: Let's put it in the key.
Matt: All right. So as they have it assembled, you rush up, leap jam it in up there and it slides into place. You hear a heavy slamming sound and what sounds like the scraping of heavy chain mail. (metallic scraping)
Travis: I grab the platinum pyramid and I put it in the Bag of Holding.
Laura: No! I already said that I had them. No. No, he doesn't do that.
Matt: The wall immediately shudders and you see a layer of dust and soot, (falling sand) off of it. as it falls to rest onto the ground and you see the wall slowly rise up. (grinding gears)
Marisha: Wait. I want to prep something. Hide!
Matt: Okay, so who's hiding?
Liam: I am.
Matt: All right, stealth check.
Laura: Yeah, and I'm hiding behind the pillar that I'm next to.
Matt: All right, so you hide behind there.
Travis: Scanlan, face death with me!
Sam: This is bullshit. I'm going to stand there, hands on hips.
Marisha: I'll hug the wall closest to the door.
Matt: Okay. All right.
Travis: It's just going to reveal another stairway, come on.
Taliesin: It's going to be another door.
Travis: Did you guys see National Treasure?
Taliesin: No.
Travis: What?
Taliesin: No, I never saw National Treasure.
Laura: Oh my god, it's so good.
Taliesin: Okay, well we'll make an evening of it.
Marisha: It's Nick Cage at his most mediocre.
Laura: St. Nicholas.
Matt: As the door eventually comes to a stop maybe a foot before it reaches the ceiling, black smoke pours in from the other chamber. You watch as it immediately fills the ceiling and then begins to dissipate up the stairway and the hallway above you where you guys originally descended from. You see flashes of sparks and embers through these clouds of black smoke and soot within the chamber. It's obscuring most of your view within the inside. And that heavy pounding, that (pounding) is much louder now. You can sense that it is actually the source of that rhythmic beat, that metal-on-metal clang you have been feeling since you first came into this series of chambers. You can see small streams of glowing orange molten rock within the chamber, which is slightly down and before you. Looks like two small ten-foot-wide rivers of molten rock, metal-- you can't quite tell from here, but it's glowing orange and red, and they both convene and go dark in the center where it looks like they are being covered or obscured by something that you can't quite make out at this distance.
Laura: A giant anvil?
Matt: Make a perception check, anybody who wants to glance in. Right now, the only people who can look in would not be Percival and Vax because they are in the way back, and Keyleth is hiding, if you want to glance in the side you can.
Marisha: I can do a peek?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: 17.
Travis: 16.
Marisha: 24.
Laura: That sound is creepy as fuck.
Taliesin: I know, it's a lot of sound.
Matt: What you can make out for the most part is this central platform is raised. It looks like there's a staircase that leads up to a middle platform that is in the center of this larger chamber, and it looks to be a couple of large, heavy platforms or pillars that have roaring flames at the edges of them. You can see beneath it, the two pools of lava that disappear beneath it, and you see a hint of a spiral staircase on each side that curls around the back end of where those two rivers of molten rock meet. Behind that, you see the flashes, (sparking) like these rhythmic engines of sparks that are pouring out of the black smoke that is perpetually filling the upper part of this chamber. However, since now it has a place to escape, the room is slowly revealing the interior. You can see on top of this platform in the center a large dark metal object, roughly four or five feet from front to back and about three feet wide of dark, jet black metal, with small veins of glowing red and orange that curl around it that occasionally flare with each impact of whatever this rhythmic metal clanging is behind it. As the smoke begins to dissipate even further, more visibility reveals the shape of this object to definitely be that of an anvil. You can see a number of chains that are linked to it on each side that dangle off the edge. You cannot quite see what's at the end of these chains; they're falling off the side of this platform and out of view. You'd have to get closer to see what they are. However, the shape that you now see, right behind this platform, looming at about 20 feet tall from your estimation at this distance, Keyleth, as you are the one who sees this before anybody else does. You see a stocky humanoid form that is looming over the anvil, both of its fists resting on each side of the platform. You can see its trunk-like arms and legs are dark gray stone, and the head carries no face; it is a smooth absence of face. You can see red cables that dangle from the top and the back of the head that are then pulled together in the back like a ponytail, and around the center of its torso and its lower body, these extremely thick layers of leather wrap that make a kilt that dangles past the knees of this giant stone structure that stands there looming over. In one of its hands you see a comparably small but impressive-looking hammer of gold and black that is currently chained to the platform. It's the one that isn't currently dangling off the side. It's in its hand and it's resting there. And you can see the heat emanating from both the pools of molten rocks on the side of it and the flames behind. Most of the imagery is perpetually shifting and being altered by the sheer volume of heat that this chamber holds. This is apparently the Core Anvil, and whatever decor around it looks very intimidating. What do you want to do?
Marisha: The humanoid figure doesn't seem to have noticed us? He's not moving?
Matt: It's not moving. It's standing there right at the platform.
Laura: Over the anvil?
Travis: Is that sound still happening?
Matt: Yep.
Laura: And the figure is 20 feet fall, you said?
Matt: Yeah. You don't see the ceiling in here, because it's all filled with black smoke.
Travis: Can we see the source of the sound? Can we see what's causing that yet?
Matt: You can't right now. It's behind that entity, and you see behind where the platform is, the darkened back portion of the chamber, these two flashes of spark and flame. As they do, you see bursts of smoke and flame billow up and continue to fill and feed the ceiling.
Marisha: I convey what I see. I think you might have a guardian you have to fight over that hammer, Grog.
Laura: Oh no, again?
Liam: I creep up past my sister and place a hand on his knee, which is in my fucking face.
Marisha: If we can take 60 seconds, I back up into a corner and start casting Conjure Elemental and conjure another water elemental to be on our side, from the staff.
Laura: Maybe he's a friendly giant really creepy-looking entity.
Marisha: Maybe he's the guy who tried to use the anvil before.
Laura: Maybe he's the Allfather. Is that what he's called?
Matt: Allhammer.
Travis: Well, look. Before we step into that arena, we control this space. How quick and quiet can you be, to see if he responds to your movement?
Liam: I can get in there.
Laura: In and out, super fast.
Liam: Sure. You want me to get a look?
Travis: Yeah. See if he reacts to you.
Laura: Dart up to him and go (taunting) and then dart back.
Marisha: Hang on. We might want to be careful about getting too high. There's a lot of smoke in there; we don't want to suffocate.
Sam: That's the only time Marisha has ever said those words. (laughter)
Marisha: We're live on the fucking internet, Sam Riegel!
Sam: Hope your mom's watching.
Liam: Thanks for watching everybody, that's the end of tonight's show. Oh my gosh.
Matt: What are you guys doing?
Liam: Can you add any of your secret sauce to my sneaking?
Matt: You have to stay within a certain radius of her to get the effect.
Liam: Never mind, I'll be fine.
Travis: Yeah, do it. This is what you do.
Laura: Just fly in really fast. Be creepy and quick.
Liam: Do I need to do an additional stealth? Creepy is automatic. It's a given.
Matt: Because this is heading into the chamber as opposed to just staying behind the platform, yes. You have to roll again.
Liam: Okay. Natural 20.
Taliesin: We don't even notice him leave.
Matt: So you head into the chamber. Okay. As you make your way inside, you look left and right and you can see the dark stonework begins to mingle with the metal and begins to go into the rough edges of the volcanic rock that it's built into. You see two large pillars to each side of you that have these red rocks embedded in the side that give this faint red glow that gives a hint of light to the chamber. There's the heat from the pools. The whole chamber in here is very uncomfortable for you. Thankfully, your armor giving you heat resistance does help a bit. You can see the anvil on top of the staircase on the raised platform and that large hulking entity that's looming over it at the moment.
Liam: If he's here and I'm over here, can I fly up just there so I can see the front of him a bit? The angle of his face, if there is one, anything to see? Or is he facing out towards us?
Matt: He's facing out towards you.
Liam: Never mind then. Shoot.
Laura: You've got fuzz on your face. Can I get it? No, you got it. It was right on his lip, so every time he talked--
Liam: Nice.
Matt: So what are you doing?
Taliesin: Be bold.
Liam: Float in space and do that.
Matt: Okay. You fly up? That is not stealthy.
Liam: No, from where I am. I'm not making noise, I'm not flying closer to him. I'm just doing this. Whatever you want to do.
Marisha: "I stealthily get his attention by waving my hand in his face."
Matt: There's a difference between stalking off in the corner and flying up into the center to get a look and then seeing if he sees you. So what are you doing? You have to distinguish that.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to fly back to the gang. Could you pick this fuzz off my face? I couldn't get it off the whole time, it just keeps re-affixing. I don't know. I flew in and out.
Taliesin: We're going to have to get his attention somehow.
Laura: It's got to be you, because you're so fast. If you get his attention you can dart out really fast.
Liam: So what do we think we're doing here? Are we talking to this thing?
Laura: Should we try talking to him?
Travis: We might.
Laura: Maybe it's better.
Taliesin: It's a crazy plan, but it just might work.
Laura: You can speak Celestial, too, right? You don't just read it.
Taliesin: Gefülten. Yes, I speak Celestial. (laughs)
Travis: Oh man, Swedish Chef over here.
Matt: So we now have, as Exandria canon, that Celestial sounds like Swedish.
Taliesin: You can bury that as deep as you want.
Matt: Thank you for that, Taliesin.
Laura: I thought Celestial sounded more like singing.
Taliesin: Well, you know, it's like a whole thing.
Liam: Can I get another quick re-rundown of the room? So he was up at the top of the stairs, facing out, not moving and was that wall behind him, or does it go further past him at all?
Matt: I'd say about 15 feet behind him you can see the occasional reflection of the flashes of light, where it looks to be there is a wall behind him. There is an end to the chamber, but you're too far away and it's too obscured by smoke for you to know exactly what's behind him.
Liam: And when I got in there, I didn't get close enough to see if there was any good hiding spots beyond him?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. There are corners to the chamber. As you fly up and glance you can see two more small equal-sized pits of coals, behind him on either side, and you do glance, two 20-foot-wide domed machines that you see the flame and the billowing smoke are being pushed out of. It's a weird engine-like structure with two of them behind it, that you can see the flames. (hammering) And that's where the sparks are shooting out of each time.
Liam: Do the talking thing, I'm going to go back in.
Marisha: Before we start, how long has it been since we entered this chamber?
Matt: It's been maybe ten minutes.
Marisha: Entered into the volcano.
Matt: Oh, into the volcano?
Marisha: Yeah, entered into the first forge room. I'm trying to find out if Freedom of Movement is still on.
Matt: Okay, with all of the smelting, put together I'd say it's probably been close to an hour.
Marisha: Can I only have one condition effect on him? Or can I stack them up?
Matt: You can have as many as you put on him. If they're not concentration, you can stack as many as you want.
Marisha: Okay, Freedom of Movement is not. I'm going to cast Freedom of Movement on you again, and then I think Enhance Ability is, though, so I'm going to use my concentration to give you Cat's Grace, right? You were using dexterity for the smelting?
Travis: Yeah, on that one.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's would be dex or strength.
Matt: For most blacksmithing, you gather that it will be dex or strength.
Travis: Well, strength is way better than dex.
Marisha: Then I'll give you Cat's Grace. You have advantage on dex checks.
Liam: And DM. How long were we in this room?
Matt: In that room? Since you entered that chamber it's been about an hour.
Liam: It's been an hour? My wings then are--
Matt: At this point, yeah, your wings have now dissipated.
Travis: Percy, I'm not afraid, go talk to this thing.
Taliesin: In Celestial, I'm going to say hello. I'm going to say it out.
Matt: You shout it into the chamber?
Taliesin: Hello? We come seeking the Allhammer. We need help. Vecna walks the earth again. We come seeking a way to defeat him once again.
Laura: Tell him we were sent by Pelor.
Taliesin: We come with the blessings of Pelor. And I'm going to start entering, very gingerly.
Travis: I'm right behind you.
Matt: Okay. So Percival is entering--
Liam: Actually, I'll throw out that I crept back in ahead of that, so in there, hiding.
Laura: I'm floating behind him on a broom.
Matt: All righty. Scanlan, where are you coming in on this?
Sam: I will lag behind Grog.
Matt: So we have Percival walking in, and who is right behind Percival?
Taliesin: Grog.
Matt: Grog, all righty. Scanlan right behind Grog.
Laura: Does it have to be single file with this?
Matt: No, it doesn't.
Laura: Okay, then I'm going to be back over to the side of Scanlan.
Matt: All right. Keyleth?
Marisha: I'll take up the rears with my water elemental.
Laura: The ground is still super duper hot, right?
Matt: The ground is, yes. All righty. So as you begin to enter the chamber and make your way towards the stairway and this central, raised platform with the two flaming pillars that flank it. Shouting this into the chamber, it echoes through, and you still hear the (hammering). Each flash of light causes this faint glow across your faces and the faces of your companions as their shapes go from dark obscured in the shadow and smoke into a brief reveal of your form. As you begin to approach the stairs, you hear this faint grinding of stone as the faceless giant's head slowly looks up to face you. But that's all.
Taliesin: I keep walking.
Travis: Me, too.
Matt: Okay. As you guys continue to walk, you get to the bottom of the stairs, and you watch as one of its hands on the side that clutches the hammer unfurls and releases it and the hammer, once let go, swings, the chain going taut and it slams into the side of the raised platform out of sight and as it does, it stands up and rights itself, but its head is still looking down at you, Percival.
Taliesin: We ask permission to use the anvil.
Laura: Tell him, nod yes. Once for yes and shake his head no.
Travis: How about this? I'm not afraid. If he takes offense, I'll take it better than most.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Matt: So do you ascend the stairs?
Travis: I am in the front now.
Matt: Grog has now moved to the front. All right. And you take your first couple steps onto the stairs. As you do, the large stone entity spins around and steps into the smoke that obscures its shoulders--
Laura: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself one more time, while this is happening.
Liam: I'm going to down a potion. And then a quick question, too. Hunter's Mark has a duration of an hour, but since that last battle lapsed, am I then not allowed to slide it to this guy?
Matt: No, it's gone now. It has been more time-- the process of smelting and then re-smelting and figuring out and adjusting everything, it has taken over an hour, sorry.
Travis: Can I use my Second Wind? Just because.
Matt: Sure.
Taliesin: Man, I could really use Spider Climb right now, goddamn it.
Travis: Heal 13 points.
Matt: All righty. So as you continue to step up the stairs. Grog, as you approach, you get about a third of the way up there and you hear what sounds like heavy metal scraping against stone and one giant burst of sound. You watch as the giant figure shifts and turns back out of the smoke, holding across its front in one hand a large cleaver-like blade with runes glowing across the side of it. About 15 feet or so from end to end, and as it spins, it looks down towards you all and holds it in front, the flat end facing out towards you in a ceremonial way.
Taliesin: What kind of runes?
Matt: Make an arcana check.
Laura: Maybe if you use it the right way, it will be fine.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: You have no idea.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Are they runes or a language? Is it a script?
Matt: These are specifically arcane runes of an enchantment-type nature. It's holding the blade out in front like that, clutching the handle on one side and putting its hand against the flat of the blade in the other.
Taliesin: Do we have our bits of god?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: We might want to have them available for the moment.
Laura: Yeah. I take mine out of my pocket.
Matt: So Grog, go up to the top? You make it to the very top of the stairs, and there is the anvil there before you, and the heat you can feel. You know when you're close to an explosion and there's that brief minute of extremely uncomfortable heat that you flinch? It's that, perpetually and all of you are sweating masses beneath your armor. You're afraid at certain points that your eyebrows are beginning to singe and curl. It's hard to breathe because the air is so hot and so thick, and occasionally you can't help but find yourself coughing at the caustic black smoke that fills a large portion of the chamber.
Travis: I am consciously checking my beard.
Matt: Okay. As you approach the top of the stairs, the head looks down at you. What do you do?
Travis: Am I standing at the anvil now?
Matt: You're standing right at the edge of the stairs, the very top of the platform, and the anvil's maybe five feet in front of you. You can see all the chains that are hanging on the side and dangling off the sides of the platform.
Travis: Can I see where the chains are leading or are they just dangling off?
Matt: The platform is about 20 feet wide and so the chains that are all hooked at multiple places to the edges and the outside part of the anvil are taut and then dangling off the edge of the platform. So you can't see where it goes. You know one of them is the hammer, because that's what he let fly off the side.
Taliesin: I kept track of which one was the hammer.
Travis: Give me the platinum.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Well, put it together first, please. Thanks. With the platinum, I will approach the anvil.
Matt: Okay. You step up to the edge of the anvil. As it does, the blade tilts so that now, as opposed to the flat facing you, one of the two bladed edges is now--
Travis: I stop.
Laura: In your vision of how to do it, did you see this guy?
Travis: Did I? No. Do I see any blacksmithing tools, anything that I would use to hammer this?
Laura: The hammer that he let go of.
Travis: Oh, that's hanging off?
Matt: You saw that, but you didn't get a great look at it by the time it was chucked off the side.
Travis: Flat. Edge. That does feel like a ready, set.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: I take one step back.
Matt: The blade goes to a flat.
Marisha: So next, after the edge, is decapitation.
Travis: I'm pretty sure that would be 150 points of damage.
Laura: What if you go and try to pick up that hammer first? Do you need it?
Travis: I'm picturing the anvil right in front of me and he's off to the side, right?
Matt: The anvil is right in front of you. He's on the other side of the anvil. You only see the upper part of the torso because he's standing off the platform below it. So you see him from the waist up; he's about 20 feet tall from top to bottom, you only see ten feet of his torso there. The blade's out in front.
Travis: And the hammer is somewhere between me and him?
Matt: Yeah. Make a perception check to see if you remember which chain it was.
Travis: Seven.
Matt: There's four chains on each side that are dangling off the side, and you are not sure which one it is.
Travis: Oh, it went hanging off.
Matt: It went held off the side, so now there are four chains that are taut on each side of the anvil that are vanishing.
Taliesin: Is he another golem?
Matt: It looks to be a golem-like construct, yeah. You have seen golems and you have encountered golems before, and the constructs of them can vary. This one, elements of it have the same proportions of a golem, but there are elements that seem more human-like as opposed to an armored battering ram. The refined details of it-- no, your perception roll isn't high enough and you're too far away to make out much more of its form.
Laura: Is his sword as big as our table is across?
Sam: Oh, what if we show him one of our little beans?
Laura: Well, I pulled mine out.
Sam: Maybe you have to show him how good a blacksmith you are to earn the privilege.
Travis: Yeah, but I've got to get to the anvil to do that.
Matt: Yeah, the blade in his hand, just the blade from hilt to end is about 15 feet long.
Marisha: Scanlan, can you read the arcane runes on his sword? Do you know what this enchantment is?
Sam: I can certainly try.
Matt: Make an arcana check, Scanlan, as you glance over, stepping into the edge of the stairs.
Marisha: Can I help him?
Matt: No, it's purely based on his knowledge.
Laura: You've got this Scanlan! Come on!
Sam: This is arcana?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Come on, vacation Scanlan.
Sam: It's a 21.
Matt: 21. The runes across the blade specifically deal with cursing the physical form of what touches its blade.
Travis: Shit. Okay, cool. Instead of walking towards the anvil, can I start walking to the right, towards one of those chains that's dangling on?
Matt: The chains are immediately to the left and right of the anvil, so to go towards the chain you'd be stepping closer to the anvil, and as you turn to the side its head tracks you as you go.
Travis: Is it tilting it down?
Matt: You haven't moved forward, so no.
Travis: Okay. Can I keep moving in that direction?
Matt: Okay, you begin to step forward towards the chain. The blade comes down to a flat end towards you.
Travis: I'll stop.
Taliesin: I'm going to try and sneak around the side of it. What's behind it?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: Okay. Glancing over, what you can see between the smoke, you see the two pits of burning coals to the-- behind, right and left of it, with small steps that lead into the coals on each side and you see the two edges of these large, cylindrical turbines of stone and metal where the impacts are and the flames flickering off it.
Taliesin: Are those bellows or is it more complicated?
Matt: You're not sure. A lot of it is obscured from the smoke that's spilling out of it and you're too far and the light's too dark in here, from that distance.
Taliesin: What would happen if we put that machine out?
Laura: Well, it's not like you can step up to the anvil before the metal's hot anyway, right? So maybe we're stepping up to the anvil too soon. Maybe you have to heat the metal first?
Taliesin: I think that it feels like a guardian. What if we put the water elemental in the--
Marisha: I was just going to say. I'm going to come into the room a little bit.
Matt: Okay. So you step in. Most of you are at the base of the stairs. Grog is at the top of the stairs. Scanlan stepped up behind him to look at the runes on the blade. That's where you currently reside.
Marisha: Is his eyesight still trained on Grog?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: I'm going to send my water elemental forward and see if it attracts its attention, since it's not a mortal.
Matt: Where do you send it?
Marisha: Towards the anvil.
Matt: Okay. So you head up the stairs. The water elemental swarms around the side. You see wherever it moves forward there's steam pouring off from the heat of the ground and the surrounding metal and stone. As it comes up the steps, more and more steam (sizzling) emerging off the back of its body, it comes to the top and it's now next to Grog. You send it towards the anvil?
Marisha: Yeah, but didn't Grog train to the right?
Matt: Grog stepped to the right and then began to step forward and then stopped.
Marisha: Does the water elemental seem to be catching its attention at all, or is it still looking at Grog?
Matt: It's still looking at Grog.
Marisha: Can I move the elemental to the left to see if it follows the elemental?
Matt: Okay, the elemental moves to the left. It doesn't follow the elemental.
Laura: I wouldn't send him any closer to the anvil, though.
Travis: Well, he might swing at the thing if it got closer.
Marisha: That's what I'm wondering.
Laura: It might send him in attack mode.
Travis: So unless we're short on ideas, we might have to starburst this thing. Scatter it.
Sam: Who forged here before? What god?
Matt: The Allhammer.
Travis: Ioun helped, Pelor helped.
Sam: Well, should we show our god shit? Did we do that yet?
Laura: Well, yeah, I'm going to fly up next to Grog, but I'm not going to go past him, and I'm going to hold up the little bead of power.
Matt: Okay. His attention focuses in between the two of you. Doesn't change his stance; the blade is still tilted down towards you.
Laura: I'm going to step one step forward with it, no further than Grog stepped that first time.
Matt: Right, yeah. The blade is still turned towards you. Doesn't seem to react.
Laura: All right, I back up. Fuck!
Travis: You thinkers better think.
Taliesin: I want to put the engineering behind it out. I want to put those pistons out.
Marisha: But what if the pistons are fueling the fires, the forge?
Travis: We still can't see what's sending up those?
Matt: You're not close enough, and you don't have a far enough view. It's blocking the bulk of it.
Laura: I'm going to fly to the side against the wall.
Travis: What about an Oracle Arrow?
Laura: Yeah, that's what I was going to do, so I could shoot it around.
Matt: Okay. So you fly off to the side of the chamber.
Laura: Yeah, and I'm going to shoot an oracle arrow behind him to see what's going on over there.
Matt: Okay. You go and fire the arrow just past him. As you do, his head darts with the speed of the arrow as it clacks against the back of the wall. Without even looking towards you, this hand releases the blade and the blade swings a wide arc about a foot above your head, Grog. (whoosh) Slams something in the back of the wall out of sight. You hear what sounds like a heavy chain snapping and falling to the ground and the wall behind you where you entered the chamber (crash) slams shut. As you all hear the sound and take in the scenery, you watch as it retracts the blade into an offensive position, and we're going to take a break. We'll be back here in just a moment, guys. We have a giveaway.
Laura: I wasn't even shooting at him!
Liam: That's all right. We did our due diligence. We poked it and we prodded it.
Matt: This is a big package going out to a bunch of folks there. It's the complete black poisonwood set, which is awesome. It's the tray, the vault, the dice tower. Oh god, it's all falling. It might be a little broken; I apologize in advance.
Sam: It smells of coffee.
Matt: Exactly. That's what it looks like. It's going to be signed by the cast for you. So to be entered in that giveaway, come into the Twitch chat over the break, and the keyword is going to be tarot. T-A-R-O-T. So yeah, we'll all be back here in a few minutes, guys. Enjoy your break, and we'll see you in a minute. [break]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role. So! First and foremost, our winner in the chat of the awesome collection of various Wyrmwood collectables is ProfessorJedi. Congratulations, ProfessorJedi. Danoba will contact you and get your information to get those to you ASAP. So congrats.
Marisha: Also, I've been flooded with tweets on where I got this shirt.
Liam: It's the best shirt.
Taliesin: And I was wearing it yesterday.
Marisha: You were wearing it yesterday. The amazing Whitney Moore made it.
Liam: This very shirt? This one?
Taliesin: A more masculine cut of this exact shirt. Not that exact shirt, but another one very similar to it.
Marisha: Although we do have a few shirts that we share and trade off.
Laura: Tell us where to get it.
Marisha: For Human Peoples! I just tweeted it out.
Taliesin: You can get a pin, you can get a hoodie, you can get any form you want.
Liam: I know you, so I'll ask you later, too.
Marisha: Yeah, okay.
Matt: All right, then. So last we left off, you had made your way into the chamber that holds the Core Anvil beneath the underwater volcano of Scaldseat. Upon approaching the central risen platform where the anvil was, some stone-built guardian that loomed over it, upon approaching and testing the boundaries, an unintentional firing of an arrow in the vicinity seemed to have triggered an aggressive stance, and the entity seems to be on the assault. So now, with the chamber there before you, I would like you all to take stock on your current positions and roll initiative.
Liam: He's going to hit you like he is at a driving range!
Travis: Yeah. Yeah, like tee-ball.
Marisha: I'm also rolling for my elemental.
Travis: Oh, that's really unfortunate. I get advantage on those, and that was terrible.
Matt: All righty. So 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 24.
Liam: 20. Jeez.
Matt: All righty. 20 to 15?
Travis: 20 to 15? For the love of god?
Matt: Okay. 15 to ten?
Laura: 14.
Sam: 12.
Marisha: 11 for my elemental.
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: 11 for my elemental.
Taliesin: You're not? Okay.
Matt: Ten to five?
Travis: Six.
Marisha: Six.
Taliesin: Oh. Six?
Laura: We are fucked!
Matt: Top of the round. As the large forge guardian stands with its giant rune blade before it, Percival. You're up first. What are you doing?
Laura: Make peace! (laughter)
Travis: When the DM smirks like that.
Taliesin: I'm going to bake a pie and deliver it-- okay, I'm going to run back towards that red crystal.
Matt: This one?
Taliesin: Yep. I run that direction, and then I'm going to use my bonus action to do that. I'm going to hold my attack until his attack.
Matt: Okay. Good to know. All right, that ends Percival's turn, holding his action to attack when it attacks. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Oh jeez. You know what, I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to run over right next to Keyleth.
Matt: All righty. 20, 25, 30. That's about as far as you can get on regular movement.
Liam: Right. I know what I want to do here. Is Percy within 30 feet of me?
Matt: Percy is, yes.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to cast Bless on Scanlan, Keyleth, and Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What does that do?
Laura: Obviously doesn't give a shit about me any more.
Marisha: Well, you stole the boots.
Laura: I gave them back!
Liam: You're so capable. You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before this spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number. So you three.
Marisha: Attack roll or saving throw?
Matt: Yes, you can add a d4 to it. Your movement and your action?
Liam: That's my action. I have a bonus action. This is an intimidating map, Matt. I am going to roll backward and sit underneath my sister and her judgemental ass.
Matt: Okay. So you're going to dash over under her?
Liam: Yep.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: Top of my turn, I'm going to fart.
Matt: (chuckles) It's how she propels the broom.
Marisha: It immediately catches your butt on fire because we're surrounded by methane gas. You take four damage.
Laura: And you're on fire.
Marisha: And you're on fire, yeah.
Taliesin: This is really intimidating. The crystals are glowing, and it makes me unhappy. Is your crystal red, too? (gasping)
Taliesin: No! Not cool.
Laura: He can walk! He can move!
Matt: Steps, leaps--
Liam: Fuck yourself! Wow!
Matt: It lands in the center.
Travis: Look at him winding up. This is awful.
Matt: With his legs down, straddling the two sides of this, and he's going to go into a blade storm, and spins around in a wide arc.
Taliesin: Okay. So if he's going to do this, I was holding my attack. I'm taking my attack now right before this happens. He has no face, does he?
Matt: Currently, you do not see a face, no.
Taliesin: There's no face. So if I were to make a head attack, that would probably be really goddamn useless. One way to find out.
Marisha: Well, he has a head. You can have a face and not a head.
Travis: Maybe it's a mask.
Taliesin: Maybe it's a mask.
Laura: Maybe it's an illusion.
Taliesin: Fire a grit.
Marisha: Did you custom mess with this figure? You did, didn't you?
Matt: Just to cover the face.
Taliesin: To hide his shame. Do I add the d4 to this, if I so am inclined?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: And I can do it every time?
Matt: Every attack, yeah.
Taliesin: Oh wow, this is so nuts. So first attack. Out of curiosity, does it keep my misfire? Does it knock me out of misfire, technically?
Matt: It's still rolling on the d20.
Taliesin: Goddamn it. Okay. Let's put that away, then, and let's take some psychic damage, because that's funny. Oh, that's great. Okay.
Matt: Nine points of psychic damage.
Taliesin: Yeah, so 142, that's cool. Ow. I'm going to put that down and get a bigger gun and try that again. And that blows that grit, as well. Much better! No, it's not. Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. It's just doing it. Never mind. I'm going to blow the rest of it and spend the end of my turn trying to fix one of my guns really quickly, and do a quick clear-out. Which is 12 versus misfire on the psychic. And I do!
Matt: You manage to clear the weapon.
Taliesin: I cleared Animus. Bad News is still out of commission. And that's my turn. Never mind.
Matt: So as the blade storm, it does a large sweep all the way around it with the blade, hitting everything within 15 feet of it.
Sam: Is it an automatic hit, or is it something I can do Cutting Words on?
Matt: It's a roll to hit, but Cutting Words would affect a single attack against an individual. Yeah, because each attack roll is separate, so it would affect one of the attack rolls.
Sam: Well, I will Cutting Words it for my attack. No, he's going to hit me no matter what. Who's in the path?
Matt: Well, let's find out first. So it's going to be Vex, Vax, Scanlan, and Grog. And then Keyleth and Percy are out of range, as well as the elemental. So against Vex that is a 17.
Laura: Doesn't hit.
Matt: Doesn't it, and you dodge out of the way. For Vax, 17.
Liam: Nope.
Matt: Rolled two threes in a row. Striking around to Grog, that is a 24.
Travis: That'll hit. Can I try my parry maneuver?
Matt: What does the parry do?
Travis: It uses your dex modifier plus the--
Laura: Sup dice? He really wrote sup dice.
Matt: Yes, you can, to reduce the attack by your superiority dice plus your dexterity modifier. Yep.
Travis: I'm going to try. Seven plus two. Nine?
Matt: So you would take 37 points of slashing damage, but instead you take nine away. That would be 28. So you get 28 points of slashing damage.
Travis: I'm not raging.
Taliesin: And you took 28 points.
Matt: And you are pushed 15 feet away. You are now right off, you get knocked over the side. You get knocked prone off onto the edge of the platform there, almost catching yourself before rolling off the side of the platform.
Liam: It's so exciting!
Matt: Scanlan, that is a natural two. That's a 16 to hit.
Sam: It will hit, but I will do my Cutting Words.
Matt: Okay, so roll a d12.
Sam: Okay, a d12. I rolled a nine.
Matt: Okay, so that will miss you. As it swings towards you, what do you do?
Sam: I will quote Dr. Smith again and I will yell at him: you are a tiresome, tin-plated, tintinnabulation.
Matt: The second construct you've bruised the ego of today. I need you to make a constitution saving throw, Grog.
Travis: Okay. 18, with a minus two.
Matt: 18? No. Your vision fades as the curse takes hold. You are considered blinded at the moment.
Travis: Okay. Anybody else? Lights out for anyone else?
Matt: And that's its turn. Vex, you're up.
Travis: No big deal.
Laura: Oh jeebies. Oh! I can use disengage! So he doesn't hit me! I'm going to move away from him.
Matt: Okay, where do you move?
Laura: All the way across, over here.
Matt: Well, your movement with your broom is? How fast is your broom?
Laura: I don't remember because I don't have the thing anymore.
Matt: (heavy sigh)
Laura: I know, Matthew! I think it's 40. Probably.
Matt: Broom of Flying  50 feet.
Liam: Wow, that was fast!
Matt: Look at that. Analog!
Laura: 50 feet. I'm writing it down right now, okay?
Matt: You can get right over right above where Percival is. So that's your bonus action to disengage, your movement to get there. What are you doing now?
Laura: I'm going to attack him.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: That dice attacked me while I rolled it. A 23.
Matt: 23 misses.
Taliesin: What?!
Travis: 23 misses?
Matt: Yeah. You strike the armor on the side of its body, and the arrow disintegrates on impact. You see bits of it catch flame from the nearby heat.
Laura: Oh lord. Okay. I thought because he was big, maybe. Is he covered head to toe in armor?
Matt: It's made of solid stone with pieces of metal armor around the body.
Laura: Great. Okay, so I'm going to attack him again but in his neck. Oh, that's good. That probably hits. 18 plus 14.
Matt: That'll hit, yeah.
Laura: Okay, I didn't want to do the math. (counting) Do I get sneak attack?
Matt: He is in base to base with your brother, so yes.
Laura: Wait, that's lightning. One extra lightning damage and then nine sneak attack.
Matt: Okay, so the total on that is?
Laura: 17 plus nine is 27.
Matt: 26, yeah.
Laura: Plus one lightning damage, so it's 27.
Matt: Right, there you go. All right, cool. The first arrow shatters, the second one you manage to strike and it embeds itself in the stone, and sticking out. It's hard to see if it had made much of an impact. That ends your turn, and that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Me? Oh Jesus. This thing's big and scary.
Matt: You're on the top of the staircase next to the water elemental and Grog, who's currently on the ground screaming that he's blind. The entity is about 15 feet away from you. You're just out of range of its blade, and it's an intimidating thing to have that close to you.
Sam: Yeah! Of course it is! I'm not dumb. Super intimidating! So how far is he from me?
Matt: He's about 16 feet from you. You're just out of range of the blade. Well, no. Actually, because it did hit you, so on the edge of there, you are within 15 feet of him, yeah.
Sam: Okay, not knowing what to do, I will (raspberry). I'm looking at my spells; I've got nothing. I will blast him with a Lightning Bolt, a level three Lightning Bolt.
Matt: Level three Lightning Bolt. Okay, so roll 8d6 points of damage.
Sam: You know what, I'll do level four, so 9d6, I suppose.
Matt: All righty, so that is a natural 20. So that's advantage on the saving throw. However, its dexterity bonus is nothing. It's a straight 20. Your spell DC?
Sam: 22.
Matt: 22, so it does not make the save.
Sam: So it's 34 points of damage.
Matt: 34 points of lightning damage to it. The bolt hits it and seems to arc through, and its faceless head slowly shifts to face you.
Sam: Jesus. I'm within melee range of him, so if I move I will get hit, yes?
Matt: If you move out of his melee range, you will, yes.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: You'll get attacked. Doesn't mean you'll get hit.
Sam: Grog, you're okay, right?
Travis: I'm blind! It's very hot!
Sam: What?
Travis: It's very hot! On the ground, and I'm blind!
Sam: I don't know what to do about you, I'm sorry! I'll inspire you, I guess, right? Because you don't need health?
Travis: Yeah, great, thanks!
Sam: (laughs) Sorry! All right, I'll inspire him, I suppose.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: What do you sing?
Sam: Oh, sorry. I will pick up my flute and I will sing: (singing) You like it when my flute goes, baby make your booty glow, Scanlan know you want to show my song, song, song, song, song.
Travis: Is that Sisqó?!
Matt: Take your d12. All righty. That's your bonus, your action, and are you going to stay where you are or are you going to move?
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to stay where I am.
Matt: Okay. Ending that turn, it comes to the elemental. Actually, no. At the end of Scanlan's turn, it's going to go ahead and use a legendary action to make a rune blade strike against Vax, who's right in front of him. That is a 22 to hit.
Liam: And this is a straight-up attack. Yeah, I believe that hits. Yes, it does.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Wait. I'll use my last Luck of the day on him, and he has to reroll.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Wait.
Liam: Wait.
Matt: That is a 19.
Liam: No. (cheering)
Matt: No. (cheering)
Travis: Well done!
Matt: So as the blade arcs overhead towards you, you barely duck out of the way. It slams on the ground, sending shards of stone and metal up in the air around you. You feel it rain over your shoulder and the back of your head as you slowly pull away from it. All righty, now it is the elemental's turn.
Marisha: Okay, it's going to move over to him. And he's bigger than large, so he's going to do a multiattack. He's going to do two slam attacks. Plus seven to hit. (groans) One's a natural one; the other's a natural 18. So one hits. 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage.
Matt: What's the attack? 18 plus?
Marisha: 18 plus seven.
Matt: Okay, so it would be 25? That hits. Are the creature's attacks considered magical?
Marisha: They're two bludgeoning attacks.
Matt: Nowhere on there does it say it does magical damage?
Marisha: It just says bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Okay. So as the elemental swings out both fists against it, no effect. None of its attacks seem to have any effect or impact on the creature. It's like bludgeoning the side of a mountain.
Taliesin: Okay. Good to know.
Marisha: And he doesn't seem to be distracted or give two shits about him.
Matt: Not at the moment, no.
Marisha: Okay. Cool.
Taliesin: There's a lot of fires to put out, I guess.
Marisha: Yeah. You know, I'll keep him on standby in case people catch on fire.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. That ends the elemental's turn, then? Grog and Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: What did you find out?
Travis: How about you go first?
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to do 9th-level Shapechange and take a cue from Scanlan and turn into a planetar.
Liam: Ooh! Do you have a big dick, too?
Sam: You can do that?
Marisha: Yes I can. With Shapechange. Right? It is a challenge rating that I can do, right? Planetars?
Matt: Yeah, you can.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You lose concentration on the elemental.
Marisha: That's fine.
Taliesin: Not like he was really--
Marisha: Doing much.
Matt: But the elemental stays and is now hostile to you.
Marisha: Right. Can't dissipate him or anything?
Matt: I forgot your figure again! I'm the worst!
Taliesin: I was going to say, can you dissipate it?
Marisha: Not really.
Taliesin: Oh. That's okay.
Matt: So the planetar size is large. We'll say for the purposes once again of this week, we'll use Doty as the planetar, so there you are.
Laura: But he says it in Swedish.
Taliesin: Dooty.
Marisha: Dooty.
Matt: Your wings extend. You are now in the planetar form.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to go up to Grog and do Healing--
Matt: Well, your action is to cast the spell.
Marisha: (groans) So I can't do anything else?
Matt: No, Shapechange takes an action to make the transformation. Next turn you can take your action.
Laura: It's okay. That's great. Grog definitely won't fall in the lava on his turn.
Marisha: I was going to say, can I at least go up to him and grab onto Grog's loincloth to make sure his ass doesn't tumble into the lava?
Matt: You could certainly try.
Taliesin: You could kind of do that.
Sam: Loin-grab.
Matt: So we'll say for the purposes of this, you glide over, and you're now flying up next to Grog on the edge of the platform. There you go.
Laura: To keep him from wandering off.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn. Grog?
Travis: Cool. Can I use my action to get up from being prone? Half my movement, sorry. Onto one knee. In my mind, because I can't see! And can I hold my action until I can see again or until it's my turn?
Matt: It's your turn.
Travis: Until I can see again.
Taliesin: You don't get to save against this, does he?
Matt: No. Nope. All right. So that ends Grog's turn, holding his action.
Travis: Crouched, so both hands are on the ground.
Matt: Okay. At the end of your turn, it's going to use another legendary action to take another swing at the slippery little rogue paladin on the ground that it can't seem to hit. Natural one. Jesus Christ. Okay. That'll be the end of that luck.
Liam: That demigod does not exist in this universe.
Matt: Percival, your turn.
Taliesin: So first thing I'm going to do is get a quick little heal bonus going, because why not. Let's do a heal. So that's 14 points up, so I'm 156. A little bit better, and that's my heal. I'm noticing that this thing's only taking magic damage. The hammer it dropped is underneath the planetar right now, right?
Matt: It is currently dangling off the side, along with other series of tools: tongs and other smaller blacksmithing accoutrements.
Taliesin: I'm going to run in that direction.
Matt: Okay. Five, ten, 15, 20. Another step, and you're starting to hit the molten metal and rock.
Taliesin: Molten metal and rock? I can't jump that, can I?
Matt: You can try, yeah. Make an athletics check.
Taliesin: Not an acrobatics check, I take it?
Matt: Not for the leap.
Taliesin: But there are chains that I can reach there?
Matt: If you're leaping towards the chains, you can attempt to grab it, yeah.
Taliesin: Well, I'm going to attempt to grab the hammer.
Matt: Okay. Are you using it to swing, or are you just trying to grab and hold on?
Taliesin: If it's available for a swing, I'll try for a swing.
Matt: Okay, I'll give you advantage if you're going for the chain, then, as you're swinging across it. Go for it.
Taliesin: Roll with advantage? Athletics?
Matt: Athletics.
Marisha: Please don't fucking fall in lava.
Taliesin: Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: Percival runs, swings across, and I'll move this a bit.
Liam: Oh, the golem is dead.
Matt: Percival barely makes it across. (grunts) If you let go of the chain, you'll land. If you hold onto it you'll dangle and swing in the center.
Taliesin: This is the hammer chain?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: So am I touching the hammer right now? But it's not a magic hammer, it's just a really nice hammer.
Matt: You just grabbed it. You can take a moment to look at it next round, if you want to.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to take a moment to look at it. I've got an action, still.
Matt: Do you want to do that, then?
Taliesin: Yeah, I'll use my action to admire the hammer.
Matt: Okay. Make a arcana check. As you're clutching the hammer now, it's dangling down, and you're holding onto it. And the heat is burning from underneath you, and you can see the (bubbling noises).
Taliesin: No. I have an arcana of seven.
Matt: Seven. You're distracted by everything going on around you and the heat in your face. You can see it above you, the black and gold scrolling on it. It looks beautiful, but you can't make out any more details than that, unfortunately.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it. Okay, I'm hopping off, then.
Matt: You swing back, you swing, and then you land. We'll say because you rolled a natural 20, I'll let you do that.
Taliesin: Yeah, all right. I'm over there, hiding. Fuck.
Matt: Okay, that ends Percy's turn. At the end of Percy's turn, it's going to use its third and final--
Liam: Damn it. What? Where did the big guy go? There he is!
Sam: He's trying to kill the cricket.
Matt: You did it? Good job.
Laura: It shut him up for a little bit.
Liam: Can't get the golem, but you can get the cricket.
Matt: (laughs) Well done. All right, at the end of Percival's turn, it's going to use its third and final legendary action to to try and get that hit on you. Natural 20. (groaning)
Travis: Oh my god, really?
Liam: Making up for the last time. Fine, give it to me.
Laura: No, can you uncanny dodge?
Liam: I can uncanny dodge, yes.
Laura: Don't you have another thing?
Liam: Just uncanny dodge, so maybe I can cancel out his doubling. Yeah. Uncanny dodge halves the attack, so it'll be right where it's supposed to be.
Taliesin: Technically, it'll lower slightly lower than where it's supposed to be, because it doesn't just halve the doubling of the dice.
Matt: 57 points of slashing damage.
Liam: Uncanny dodge.
Matt: All right, reduce that to 28 points of damage and your vision goes dark.
Laura: Oh no. Wait, don't you have to roll the constitution?
Matt: That's true. Roll constitution save.
Liam: Not good. 14.
Matt: Your vision goes dark. It hits you, and you hit the ground, and the sheer-- the searing pain hits your body, and as you get up, it feels like all the smoke fills your vision. All you see are occasional flashes of red, almost like you're surrounded by a miniaturized electrical storm, and you have no idea what's around you.
Marisha: So he's blind?
Matt: You're considered blind for the moment, yes. It's your turn.
Liam: Okay, I would like to cast Vow of Enmity on this dick, which will put me at regular, because I would get advantage versus the disadvantage of blindness, so now I'm at regular.
Laura: Is it a visual spell?
Matt: That's what I'm checking right now.
Liam: Oh, wow. I've got it here.
Marisha: Yeah, spellcasting's a bitch.
Matt: Vow of Enmity. Creature you can see within ten feet of you. You cannot currently see it.
Travis: Shit, y'all. Fuck.
Liam: Okay. Instead, I'll use my bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark.
Matt: You need--
Liam: Visual on that as well? Okay, got it, never mind. It's not his turn yet, wow. Okay, I'm going to use my bonus action to disengage. I can move five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. And I'm going to get the fuck out of here. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, there. And that's it, I'm fucking blind and I ran because I can't see shit. Done.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. It's now its turn. It gets its legendary actions back.
Laura: Guys, this is bad. We haven't actually done anything to him, have we? No, I got an arrow on him.
Taliesin: You got an arrow, which didn't probably do any physical--
Laura: It was a magical arrow.
Matt: See if it gets its blade storm back. Nope.
Travis: Probably should have cast the mansion door before we started.
Taliesin: We can still do that.
Travis: It takes a minute to cast.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Marisha: We can make this work.
Laura: We can't even run away.
Liam: He's coming to finish me off. Look at this motherfucker!
Laura: He's going to kill all of us, dude. He can get all of us in a circle. Everybody.
Marisha: I lost control of my elemental.
Matt: Here's what it's going to do. Because you ran off. It hit you; it's not even focused on you. The head turns and looks towards you, Vex'ahlia. It's going to make a rune blade attack against you. Oh jeez. That is a 17.
Laura: Doesn't hit.
Matt: Jesus Christ, it has rolled so many twos and threes, then 20. It swings and you dodge out of the way. However, hearing the skittering of a gnome behind him, without even looking, it back-kicks behind it with its foot.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my god.
Matt: That is going to be a 21, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, yeah, of course.
Matt: All right, so you take 23 points of bludgeoning damage and you are pushed 15 feet away from it and knocked prone.
Laura: No!
Marisha: No!
Matt: I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, Scanlan.
Liam: Hey, you're blessed, so add 1d4.
Sam: Oh yeah, that's right. Okay, that's terrible.
Liam: Plus 1d4.
Sam: So I've already rolled a 13, plus a d4. This is not going to go well, is it? d4 is another one. That's 14.
Laura: Can you inspire yourself?
Sam: What?
Liam: Inspire yourself.
Laura: Inspire yourself.
Sam: This is not a check; this is a save.
Matt: Well, let me double check on that for your bardic ability. And how many more bardic inspirations do you have at this point, by the way?
Sam: I've only used two.
Matt: You used Cutting Words, you've inspired Keyleth, and you've inspired Grog.
Sam: Oh, Cutting Words counts? Then I've used four so far, and I have two more to go.
Matt: Two more to go. And as far as your peerless skill, you can add it to any ability check, yeah, so not a save, unfortunately.
Sam: All right, bye guys.
Matt: What was the total?
Sam: 14.
Taliesin: Is that including your dex save?
Sam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, wow.
Matt: Scanlan gets pushed off the edge and falls prone (sizzling) into the molten metal below.
Taliesin: Oh man. This is so bad.
Travis: That's a lot of dice he's picking up.
Matt: You're on fire.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Travis: I feel like you're filling a playground with gravel right now. I feel like he's playing putt putt golf with us.
Liam: Well, he's strung us along on several battles to get all of our juice out.
Marisha: Yeah, he really has. We need to rest.
Matt: You take 53 points of fire damage, Scanlan, as you are currently now partially submerged in molten metal and screaming in horrible pain.
Liam: Man. Boy, it sucks, doesn't it, buddy?
Sam: But with vibrato.
Matt: That's going to end its turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Great. I'm going to disengage.
Matt: Okay, so you use your bonus action to disengage. Where are you going?
Laura: I'm going to go over to Grog.
Matt: All right, so you fly over, and where are you going?
Laura: I'm going to fly next to him and I'm going to touch him and I'm going to cast Lesser Restoration on him.
Matt: Okay. You use your action to cast Lesser Restoration. So the Lesser Restoration affects--
Laura: Heals blindness and deafness.
Liam: Good, go to the 250 hit point guy. Good call.
Laura: He needs to be able to fucking see so he can smith while we're trying to distract this fucker.
Matt: The blindness fades as she touches you. Your vision comes back.
Travis: Cool. Oh, right, then I held my action for that.
Laura: Yeah, that's the thing, he was holding.
Travis: Should I try and smith?
Taliesin: Here's the question. I should know this how quickly can these things be made?
Matt: Well, to be honest, the process of each trammel is going to be a 15-minute process. You can't hyper-smith in the middle of battle. (groaning)
Laura: Well. Okay. Do I have any more movement left?
Matt: That's 15 minutes if it's a straight multiple people helping circumstance.
Laura: Do I have any more movement left?
Matt: Not really. You had to go over an arc to get there.
Taliesin: You could grab the hammer.
Travis: Yeah, but what purpose would it serve?
Taliesin: I don't know. Maybe it's a control hammer. I don't know. I'm grasping at fucking straws here.
Matt: Vex?
Laura: That's my last level two that I cast.
Travis: I could try.
Taliesin: You've got actions.
Laura: Great, so I don't have any more Lesser Restorations. I can cast it at a higher level, maybe.
Marisha: You also still have Freedom of Movement on you. You don't have anything else at all; I got lost concentration. But you do have Freedom of Movement.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Grabbing that hammer is definitely an option.
Laura: I don't know why you would grab the hammer.
Travis: Maybe he'd stop moving if I grabbed the hammer?
Matt: Vex, is that all you're doing this turn?
Laura: I mean that's all I can do. That's my action, my bonus, and my movement.
Matt: Yep, all right, so Scanlan.
Travis: Oh, but I held my action until I had sight.
Matt: Correct, you have sight now. What are you going to attack? Because you can't move, it's just your action.
Travis: You're on the hammer, aren't you?
Taliesin: I let go.
Travis: Should I try pulling up the hammer and see if that does something? Okay, I'll try and pull the chain up to grab the hammer.
Matt: Technically, when you're holding your action to do something, like an attack, you can only do that because it's a reaction, a very quick thing. Basically, as soon as you get your vision you're like, (panting).
Travis: I will rage, and that's it.
Matt: I'll let you rage on that, sure.
Marisha: Can he attack the elemental that's now rogue across from him?
Matt: He's not within range, unfortunately. It's across the way.
Travis: Can I turn around and look, now that I'm right up next to the Core Anvil, is there anything that I'm noticing about it that would move or knock off? A switch or a button?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Doesn't look just like a flipping anvil. Yeah, okay, cool. That's a two.
Liam: This is such a shit-show! Love it!
Matt: It looks like an anvil, a beautiful anvil, a primal built, ageless anvil.
Travis: I never see shit!
Liam: Hey, that's my magic trick!
Matt: All right, so Scanlan. You're currently submerged in molten metal, screaming, on fire. Your turn begins and you take six points of fire damage. You're prone and sinking into it. What are you doing?
Laura: You should probably get out, right?
Sam: I guess, yeah, probably. (laughs) I will, I guess, save my life and Dimension Door out of there.
Matt: Okay, you Dimension Door out of the lava?
Sam: Yes, please. I have no other options.
Matt: You can walk out of it. You're right next to the edge.
Sam: Oh, I'm next to the edge?
Matt: Yeah, you could pull yourself out of it.
Sam: Oh. Well, I'll try that first with my movement, I guess, right?
Matt: Yeah, with your movement you get out. You're ten feet out of it. You're on fire still, but you're no longer melting in the lava. You're hurt, but you turn the corner and you can see the giant guardian that is now currently facing off with the rest of your allies on the other side of the platform in the far corner of the room. You're staring at its back. What are you doing?
Sam: Oh boy. I wasn't expecting to attack this turn. I'll do the lightning again because it seemed to have some damage. No, you know what? We've got to block his sword, right? Shit. I will Bigby's Hand and try to grapple his sword.
Matt: Okay, you're doing another Bigby's Hand? And you'll attempt to grapple his sword?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: I don't know if that's going to work at all.
Matt: Well, let's give it a shot. Bigby's Hand moves over here.
Liam: Oh, he's dead! He's dead, Matt. Game over.
Matt: If we go by that tactic, Bigby's Hand's dead. You've all died. I'll put him there. Percival has been dead for a long time. We'll put that there. That's good. There you go. All right.
Laura: I want to try to move Bigby's Hand to hold on to his arm. Can I try it?
Matt: If you want to. Grasping Hand?
Sam: I guess. This is supposed to be against a creature, not against an item.
Matt: Right, I'm letting you do this, though. It's fine. It makes sense. It's big enough. Make an athletics check, using the strength of Bigby's Hand, which is a plus eight. Roll a d20 and add eight to it.
Sam: It's a 19.
Liam: Blessed! Hashtag blessed!
Sam: 19.
Taliesin: Plus a d4.
Sam: Plus three, so that's 22.
Matt: 22. It rolled a 19. (cheering)
Matt: It is grappling the blade. What that means is, for the purposes of this, all of its attacks are at disadvantage until it can break free from Bigby holding the blade.
Liam: Bigby's Hand!
Matt: That's your turn, unless you want to use a bonus action for something.
Sam: I will use a bonus action to level two Healing Word myself.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: I will sing, (singing) I'm freaked out by the shape of me! I'm burned up and nobody can see. So you know what I'll do to thee? Give some health to my body. (vocalizing) (laughter)
Matt: Damn it, Sam. Take your 2d4 plus six. Finishing that out, it is the elemental's turn.
Marisha: He is slowly steaming away, right, because it's so hot?
Matt: You're not going to rules-lawyer me out of the elemental. (laughter)
Matt: It makes a slam attack against both Vex and Grog. Vex, that's a 15 plus seven, 22. And Grog, that's a 17 plus seven, 24. What's the bludgeoning damage from the elemental?
Marisha: It's 2d8 plus four.
Matt: Vex, you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage. Grog, you take 11 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to five.
Liam: Where you at, big guy?
Travis: 190.
Matt: Grog and Keyleth. Your turn. Keyleth, you now have complete control of your form.
Marisha: Now people know why I don't conjure that many elementals. I'm going to go fly away, since Grog is now fine. Go over to my boyfriend. Would it be part of my movement to grab him and pull him away a little bit, and then can I still have an action, or would that be my action?
Matt: No, that would be your action.
Marisha: Then I'm going to fly by and do a Healing Touch on you. You get 6d8 plus three hit points and you are freed from your blindness.
Liam: Oh, I love you so much!
Laura: That's amazing! Hey, Scanlan, you should have done that before. That would have been really cool.
Liam: Holy shit!
Marisha: 12 plus four, 15. No, 16. Plus another three brings us to 19. Plus another four brings us to 22. 23. And then a three brings us to 26 hit points and you are cleared from your blindness. Can I use the rest of my fly speed of 120 feet like my boyfriend to then fly away?
Matt: Certainly. Which direction?
Marisha: I want to go back and over on this side. Yeah, a little bit closer. Yeah.
Matt: You fly over. As you swing, it glances in your direction and with a reaction, gets an attack of opportunity on you with disadvantage. That's 20. What's your armor class in the planetar form?
Liam: Captain Planet AC is 29.
Marisha: 19, so it hits me.
Liam: Hashtag blessed, though!
Marisha: I am blessed!
Matt: Doesn't add to your armor class. It's attacks and saving throws. It's a level one spell, guys. It hits you. You take... 42 points of slashing damage, and I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: You can't be blinded as a planetar, can you?
Matt: You are not immune to blindness as a planetar.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it.
Laura: There's no way to run away from him. We have to either defeat him or find a way to disengage him.
Marisha: Is it con as me or con as the dude?
Travis: There are four chains hanging off of the thing, and we all know the hammer is attached to one.
Taliesin: The rest are other tools.
Marisha: Do I take my planetar's constitution?
Matt: Yes. That's plus seven.
Marisha: That's cool, but then I still have my war caster ability, too, right? I have advantage?
Matt: No, that's against concentration, so you will have to do that in a second, but first, this is to see if you go blind or not. This is a curse effect.
Travis: Don't they have truesight and stuff?
Marisha: I do have truesight as a planetar. It is pretty good, so that's 27.
Matt: 27? Okay. You resist the blindness. However, now half that damage.
Marisha: You said 42?
Matt: So half of that is 21, so DC 21. Make a constitution saving throw with advantage.
Taliesin: With a d4.
Marisha: I'm good. 17 plus my constitution?
Matt: Yeah, you're fine. So you maintain concentration on your form. Perfect. That finishes Keyleth's turn. Grog, what are you doing?
Travis: Yeah. It's hammer time. I'm going to run down here-- five, ten, 15-- right there, to this side.
Matt: Perfect, you can get up right against there. The elemental gets one swing at you as you go out of its range. That is a three plus seven. Ten. It hits your back and it's like, ooh. It's kind of cool.
Travis: And I'll take both of my attacks at the giant death-bringer. Just reckless, not great weapon master. Hoping for a crit, which was not it. 31.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Great. That's better. 32.
Matt: Hits. These are both with the minus five?
Travis: No, not great weapon master. Just reckless. Six, 22 for the first one.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And I can't disarm him; he's a giant. And 20 for the second one.
Laura: His weapon is grappled right now, so I don't know if you'd have advantage on trying to disarm him.
Travis: He's gargantuan, though.
Liam: He's already at a negative because of Bigby.
Matt: All right.
Travis: And that is it.
Matt: That is it? All right. So that ends your turn. At the end of your turn, Grog, it's going to go ahead and use its legendary action to swing back at you as you're hitting it. So you slam it in the back with the axe, as it angrily swings a wide strike towards its back, hoping to catch the side of your chest, with disadvantage, that is an eight plus 14. 22.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: That hits. Okay. You take 27 points of slashing damage, reduced to be 13.
Travis: Can I use my stone's endurance to reduce that further?
Matt: If you want to, or you can take a retaliation shot. Up to you. Don't forget your retaliation.
Travis: Yeah, I was going to do it afterwards. I thought he did two hits backwards?
Matt: Well, stone's endurance is a reaction. You get one reaction, so it's one or the other. I'm pretty sure it is. I'll double check.
Taliesin: I feel like we're missing at something really hard.
Matt: Essentially.
Laura: I feel like he's invulnerable.
Matt: Yeah, you can use your reactions. It's one or the other.
Travis: Okay, yeah. I'll do the retaliation.
Matt: All right, cool. You take the 13 damage. Constitution saving throw, please.
Travis: Okay. Oh shit. It's that fucking sword. Right.
Sam: You have inspiration.
Travis: Thank you. Going to need it. 20. I'm going to use my inspiration. 28.
Matt: 28. You resist it. No issue. So now you can take your retaliation shot.
Travis: Okay! Reckless, great weapon master. Why not? That's 31 minus five, that's 26?
Matt: That hits. Roll damage.
Travis: Nice. Fuck. 27.
Matt: 27 points of damage.
Travis: That was a shit roll. I rolled a one. Oh! I reroll ones! Sorry. Reroll ones. Thanks. 12! That's way better! (cheering)
Matt: That's an extra 11 damage on it.
Travis: 28, 38.
Matt: 38 damage. There you go. So as you resist the effect, you come back with a third strike, slamming it into the back, and you can watch some of the armor in the back cracks. You can see bits of glowing orange in places. It's still looking fine, but it's taking hits. It isn't impervious.
Marisha: This is why I wanted a stupid water elemental.
Liam: He's on death's door, guys. We got him.
Matt: That brings us to Percival's turn.
Taliesin: I'm going to run all the way back to the back of the room, I'm going to put as much distance-- well, actually I'll take my shots first. I've got Animus up, so I'm going to spend a point on it. I'm running out of grit. And I'm going to try and take a shot on this guy.
Laura: I'm just above you telling you how hot you look as you're doing it.
Marisha: Physically, you're really sweaty right now.
Liam: Your hair is so white. You're like Steve Martin without the ukulele. I'm just so turned on by you.
Taliesin: 36. That hits, I assume, so that's 1d10 plus 1d6, and then I'm also going to blow the last of my lightning into that, as well. That's 18 points of standard damage, two points of psychic damage, and 15 points of lightning damage.
Matt: Nice. 35 total on that shot.
Taliesin: That's one shot. This is my last advantage shot. I'm going to take another advantage shot on him. Here we go.
Travis: Come on, dude.
Taliesin: That's 24 on the advantage shot.
Matt: 24 just hits. (cheering)
Travis: That's what it is. 24.
Taliesin: Here we go. 15 points of damage plus three points of psychic damage. I should start taking track of this. Shooting again, no advantage. 20.
Matt: 20 does not hit.
Taliesin: I'm going to burn an action surge and take three more shots. And I'll roll 3d20. Actually, hold on. No, it wouldn't matter. 22, yeah it doesn't actually hit. So here we go. Taking three shots. Oh my god! So this is great. I take three more shots. First one is 29, so that hits.
Liam: If any of those miss, you're blessed.
Taliesin: No, they did not. So this is going to be fine. I did roll the other two. 19 and 19, which are both criticals. I got two criticals that we're going to get into. First shot is not a critical. That's 12 points of damage and one point of psychic damage. And then let me get an extra d10 and an extra d6. This is weird. New critical. New type of critical.
Matt: Takes half of the critical damage next turn. What was the total on that last one?
Travis: 26.
Matt: All right. So critical damage.
Taliesin: Critical damage. That's 11 points of psychic damage.
Matt: The psychic damage is doubled, too, by the way.
Taliesin: Yeah! And 20 points of normal damage. 20 normal and 11 points of psychic.
Matt: Okay, so 31.
Taliesin: And now the next critical hit.
Liam: (whispering) Yes. Yes, Percival.
Travis: Come on, you sweet chinchilla.
Taliesin: Oh my god. That's a terrible roll. That's okay. 12 points of normal damage and six points of psychic damage.
Matt: So 18.
Taliesin: And so the two of those combined, cut in half, is what he takes next round's bleed damage.
Matt: Yeah. Which is 49, so he'll be taking 24 points of bleed damage.
Taliesin: I'm running in the opposite direction!
Liam: You broken bastard.
Matt: So you run around this way.
Taliesin: Oh, and that's two crits, which means I get two grits back. I'm like (grunts) that way.
Matt: This is as far as you can get. If you want to go that way, you'll have to go around in lava, so you have to go around. That's as far as you can get there. That ends your turn, Percival. All right, at the end of your turn it's going to use its third and final legendary action to hack down at you because you're up next.
Liam: Bring it. I have no fear.
Matt: All right, so that is a 25.
Liam: Hits.
Matt: All right.
Sam: That was with disadvantage?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Damn.
Liam: Uncanny Dodge. Halve it.
Matt: 33 points of slashing damage.
Liam: Okay, halved.
Matt: All right, so it'll be 16, and I want you to make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: Right after you were healed.
Taliesin: This is just what you're going to be doing.
Marisha: That's why I went there.
Liam: That gets me to 18.
Matt: 18, not enough. The darkness takes over again in your eyes. It's still there in front of you, you know where it is, but your vision is taken from you. That is going to end that. It's now your turn.
Liam: I hate holding my turn, because I don't understand it. If I hold my turn, I can only attack when it gets back to me, right?
Matt: Depends on whatever action you decide to hold.
Liam: Can I hold my turn to cast Vow of Enmity until I can see again?
Matt: You can do that if you want to.
Liam: I'm going to hold my turn until I can fucking see to cast Vow of Enmity and attack.
Matt: So you're expecting somebody else in your party to come heal you?
Liam: I'm going to do fuck all without it. Yes. That's what I'm doing.
Matt: Okay, all right.
Taliesin: You can move. You have a bonus action.
Laura: Well, bonus action is Vow of Enmity.
Liam: This guy can get anywhere. He has shown us that he can get anywhere on this map. There's no point going anywhere. No, I'm going to stay put. That's what I'm doing. I've already called it.
Matt: Okay, so Vax is going to hold that. It's now his turn. Let's see if he gets the blade storm back. Does! He does get the blade storm back. So he's going to leap and land up here in the center. Oh god.
Laura: (singing) Bigby's Hand!
Taliesin: Oh, that also means he takes his bleed damage this turn.
Matt: It does, yeah. So we're going to go ahead and put this over here.
Liam: Can anybody do an attack of opportunity?
Travis: I do.
Liam: And then, can I get an attack of opportunity even though I'm holding? I have no idea.
Matt: You will, yes.
Taliesin: I'm so excited by how you're doing this here. This is some crazy shit.
Laura: It's the sword. It throws him off balance.
Marisha: He's been doing his yogas, though.
Matt: So takes another 24 damage, all righty. Both you guys get attacks of opportunity.
Travis: Reckless, great weapon master. 30.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Okay. For 30 points of damage.
Matt: (crash) It takes the hit, it lands. Go ahead and make your attack.
Liam: Okay, so I had him flanked with Grog, right, because he was right between the two of us? So down to regular attack.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Good. That hits. That's 18 plus a lot. Plus 14.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: That is 11, plus psychic damage is 13, plus these fuckers. (counting) 35.
Matt: Okay, takes 35 damage, and the blindness fades.
Marisha: Wait, how did you do that?
Laura: His concentration, maybe?
Liam: Yeah, maybe because I cut a bit?
Matt: It seems less concentration. You get the sense that the blindness lasts until you hit it.
Liam: Can I see now?
Matt: You can now see.
Liam: So now I can do my held turn.
Matt: Yes, you can.
Liam: Am I within ten feet? I'll move forward a bit.
Matt: Well, you held your action, not your turn. There's a difference.
Liam: Okay, but he's near--
Matt: I will say, the minute you hit him and the vision comes back, I'll allow you to do it.
Liam: Well, wait. Is he within ten feet of Grog, would you say? His foot?
Matt: Sure, I'll let it happen.
Liam: Well, I'm going to save it, then.
Laura: No, he said you were in range. He was in range right when you moved.
Liam: I understand that. I'm weighing multiple options, dear. No, I will cast Vow of Enmity. I'll cast it on my bonus action, then attack, attack.
Matt: You held your action as Vow of Enmity.
Liam: To attack, right, to attack. Which was to cast Vow of Enmity and not to attack, as well?
Matt: You can't hold your whole turn. You hold an action.
Liam: Vow of Enmity.
Matt: So as it lands there, it uses blade storm, (crash) strikes around as it sweeps everyone in a 15-foot radius, which will be Grog, Vax, Vex, the elemental, and Scanlan.
Laura: Aw, he can even get Scanlan? But he's so little!
Sam: Am I still holding on to his sword?
Matt: With Bigby, you are, so disadvantage on all these attacks, correct. So against Scanlan, that is, hah. Avoided a natural 20 because of that. So that instead is going to be a 22.
Sam: That hits.
Matt: All righty. Against Vax is a 29.
Liam: (scoffs) Yeah.
Matt: All right, against Grog. That is a 21.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: And against Vex is a 24.
Laura: Ooh, that hits. And the elemental.
Matt: Elemental is an 18.
Marisha: Hits. Armor class 14.
Matt: Yeah. All right, so each of you suffers 44 points of slashing damage.
Laura: I'm going to uncanny dodge.
Matt: Okay, so 22.
Liam: And I've already used my uncanny dodge in this round, I think.
Matt: Yes, because when he took his turn, you did.
Liam: Yeah, so mine is 44 for me.
Matt: 44 to the elemental; you'll want to keep track of that.
Marisha: Yep, I'm on it.
Matt: And then 22 to you. And I need all of you to make constitution saving throws.
Travis: Come on, baby!
Matt: The elemental fails.
Taliesin: It's a blind elemental
Marisha: Nope, it can be blinded! He's got 70 hit points. He hasn't taken any more damage, correct?
Laura: Oh no! Ugh!
Marisha: Who's blind?
Laura: I'm blind!
Marisha: You're blind? Is Grog blind, as well?
Travis: But I'm in melee, so if he leaves, I can hit him.
Taliesin: Yeah, and the minute you take your turn, you can make a reckless attack.
Liam: Blind. Wow.
Matt: Scanlan, what's your constitution saving throw?
Sam: I made a 23.
Matt: Scanlan resists it.
Liam: That's you, and you, and Scanlan.
Matt: So now, Scanlan, I need you to make a concentration check on Bigby's Hand now.
Marisha: War caster. You have advantage!
Matt: So DC 22, because it was 44 damage. So you have advantage.
Sam: The first one was that poop thing again.
Matt: Okay, so one.
Sam: Second one, I only rolled a seven, so I'm sure this is not going to add up to something good.
Liam: What's your save? What did you roll?
Marisha: Yeah, are you sure the poop is the one?
Matt: Yeah, the poop is a one, we already covered that.
Sam: What am I adding to this, Matt?
Matt: Your constitution saving throw.
Liam: Plus 1d4.
Matt: Plus 1d4.
Sam: Okay, I'm still not going to hit 22. This is a check, though, so I could inspire myself, maybe?
Matt: It's not a check, it's a saving throw.
Sam: Okay, then it can max out at 20.
Matt: Well, 20 is the max. That's what you're trying to hit. The DC is 20.
Sam: Oh! Okay, well then I will roll my d4 and see if I can hit it. I only rolled a three, not a four. (groaning)
Matt: Bigby fades. No longer holding the weapon, the hand fades and the blade is now no longer held back. The creature's looking pretty hurt, but it's still hanging in there.
Travis: All I see is wicked Davy Jones wanting to chop us to pieces.
Matt: End of his turn, Vex, you're up.
Sam: Who's up?
Matt: Vex's turn.
Laura: Do I remember where he was? Can I shoot in his general vicinity, even though I'm blind?
Travis: Yeah, please, shoot me in the neck.
Marisha: I thought you said, "can I shoot at his genitals?"
Liam: Is Grog close enough for flanking for her?
Laura: 21 won't hit him, right? Okay, so I'm going to try it again. Goddamn it. No, it's at disadvantage. Neither of them hit.
Matt: Both arrows go wide, disappearing into the smoke of the room. You still hear the machine, (booming), behind you.
Laura: Okay. Let's see if this is-- nope, it's an action because I'm a genius. I'm going to back up. I don't know if that'll do anything. I'm going to disengage and I'm going to back up on my broom.
Matt: Okay, make a perception check with disadvantage.
Laura: Great. I'm rolling so good tonight. Shush. 17.
Matt: 17. Because your training saved you, you pull back and you manage to hear the echoes of the bubbling and the sounds nearby. You know where the stairs are, and you don't fall off of them.
Laura: Oh, I'm on my broom, so I was flying backwards.
Matt: Okay, well if that's the case then you managed to drift backward. How far back do you want to go?
Laura: As far back as I can without dying.
Matt: Well, you're going to pull back and then slam into the wall over here, because you're not quite sure where that is. So we'll say you're there. That ends your turn, Vex. At the end of your turn, the forge guardian's going to use, let's see--
Taliesin: Don't say "let's see."
Travis: I'm right under his foot. I'm right there.
Matt: Yep. He's going to go ahead and use a legendary action to attack with his rune blade against--
Taliesin: I was going to say, you are the heavy damage dealer so far.
Matt: You are hitting it a lot. Yeah. It's going to go against you. Just for this hit. Advantage against you? Natural 20.
Laura: Oh no! Why? What are you at?
Marisha: That's a lot of air math going on.
Matt: 61 points of slashing damage, halved to 31.
Travis: Okay. Cool. Can I take my retaliation?
Matt: It hasn't come back to your turn yet, because you've already used that last turn.
Travis: You are right.
Matt: Wait, have we? Because you went last time to attack it, yeah, and you took it as it hit you back at the end of your turn. Yeah. So that brings us to Scanlan's turn.
Sam: I will cast another Lightning Bolt at level six this time, which is 11d6.
Matt: It rolled a 17 on its dex save. It has no dex bonus, so that hits without issue, so full damage, so 11d6.
Sam: Okay. 11d6, yes. Okay. That's only 42.
Matt: That's pretty decent, though. 42 points of lightning damage as you blast it from behind. (crackling) The energy hits the back and arcs through its weapon and its blade, and you can see steam rising up around where its fingers grasp the handle. The leather kilt that hangs at its sides is singed and burned from the impact. Well done. Do you want to move or stay where you are?
Sam: How far am I from the thing?
Matt: You're about ten, 12 feet from it.
Sam: I will not move.
Taliesin: Oh, but you're not blind anymore.
Sam: I was never blind.
Taliesin: Oh, that's right. You avoided it.
Sam: But me hitting it doesn't un-blind someone else, does it?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Oh, shit. Okay, I'll Healing Word myself again, I guess.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What is it? 2d4 plus six.
Matt: At the end of that turn, it's going to use its second legendary action to attack Vax this time. And since you're blind, it has advantage. That is a 29 to hit.
Liam: Yeah, that hits. This is within the same round, by the way.
Laura: What is your--
Liam: Low.
Taliesin: That's okay.
Laura: You can't die.
Matt: 29 points of slashing damage.
Laura: He can't die? That's a rule?
Taliesin: Let's not test that.
Matt: All right, end of Scanlan's turn. It's the elemental's turn. The elemental is going to thrash whatever's nearby. It's hostile to everything in the area, and the closest thing to it is the creature. So it's going to attack with disadvantage twice against it. That's a miss and a natural one on the second one, yeah. The elemental swings and is hitting nothing in the air. It's angry and thrashing about. At the end of its turn, it's going to use his last legendary action to attack Vax one more time. That's 29 again?
Liam: Hits! Don't even bother; I'm unconscious.
Matt: Okay, so you are, yeah. It would've been 26 points of slashing damage. So with that, you are unconscious.
Travis: Okay. We're good.
Matt: All right, so that brings us to Grog and Keyleth's turn.
Travis: I'll go.
Marisha: Go first, see if you hit him.
Travis: I piñata swing, reckless, great weapon master.
Matt: Okay, so the reckless cancels out blindness, so this is a straight roll.
Travis: Single. Don't fuck me, Gil. Blacksmith die for a blacksmith thing. That's not great. That's a miss. Yeah. 20 minus five is 15.
Matt: Yeah. You swing, and it hits air.
Travis: Well, I have one more. I'll make it reckless and not great weapon master. Natural 20.
Matt: Gil fucked and un-fucked you real fast.
Travis: It's been so long since I've done this, I don't remember how this works. Okay. So it's three times the thing.
Matt: Yeah. For you, you roll the dice and you do the critical damage like you normally would.
Laura: Yeah! 12!
Matt: So that's 24, plus your bonuses.
Travis: Which is 16.
Matt: And the extra necrotic damage, right? Have you been forgetting necrotic damage this whole time? Grog.
Liam: There's a lot of rules and a lot of math. It's a big book.
Travis: Yeah, I've been forgetting the fucking--
Matt: Well, now's the time to remember it, buddy.
Liam: Travis has a job, another job.
Matt: It's all good.
Travis: 1d6 necrotic damage.
Marisha: Sam, how many hit points do you have left?
Sam: Well, there seems to be some confusion about that question. I have it at 62, but the overlay has me at 44, so I don't know.
Matt: Plus two additional d12s.
Travis: A one, 51. And a seven, so 58.
Matt: 58 points of damage on the hit, and your blindness goes away.
Laura: Yay!
Liam: Must be nice.
Laura: It's okay. It's all right. I forgot Hunter's Mark for so many episodes.
Matt: So this time as you swing out, it cracks into the side of him and the axe actually wedges a few inches into the side of its thigh and rear region. As it wedges in there, you actually hear the first sound emanate from this creature: (growling). A deep, guttural, vibrating, low sound. And as soon as your vision clears up, you see it turn around, its head under its arm, down at you. You're seeing some damage on this thing.
Travis: I'm like Tony Stark in the Hulkbuster armor. I'm sorry! Go to sleep!
Matt: That the end of your turn?
Travis: Yes, that's the end of my turn.
Matt: Keyleth, do what you're going to do.
Marisha: You're blind as, well? Okay. I see my boyfriend down, but I think he's all right, he's fine. You're fine. God, all my friends are fucking blind. I turn and I fly over to Vex and I go, snap out of it! I slap a healing whatever into her. A healing touch.
Matt: All right, so you heal the blindness.
Marisha: So 6d8 plus three. Give me a d8 again.
Taliesin: Reroll ones?
Marisha: Not with healing. (counting) 32.
Matt: You heal 32, and your blindness dissipates.
Matt: All right, so you still have movement.
Marisha: I'm going to fly back to where I was and patrol.
Matt: All right, so you're right there at the edge of the lava, keeping an eye on the battlefield.
Marisha: Yeah, and out of his swinging range.
Matt: Yes, you're not quite within his range. All right, that ends your turn. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: Taking three shots. And that's a 34 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Anything that didn't hit, I'm going to run Bless. So that's 15 points of damage, five points psychic. That's 24.
Matt: 24 just hits. No, the Bless is concentration, right? That shit's gone.
Taliesin: That misses, and then the other one misses.
Matt: Totally forgot to keep rolling concentration for you on that. That's a thing you've got to keep in mind whenever you take damage.
Taliesin: Burning an action surge for three more shots. Burning a grit for advantage.
Matt: That's right, because you have another action surge.
Taliesin: So advantage number one is a 17 to hit. 26, that hits? Let's put that away; that's not helpful anymore. That's 13 points of damage, two points psychic. Next advantage shot. That's a natural 20.
Marisha: Thanks, Gil! Gil's on our side!
Taliesin: That's seven points of psychic damage. Oh shit. That's 28 points of piercing damage.
Matt: Plus nine points psychic?
Taliesin: Plus seven points psychic. Half that damage, next round.
Matt: Right. The total of that together, then is?
Taliesin: Total, (counting) that's 34.
Matt: So it takes 17 damage next round.
Taliesin: Next round, on its turn. I'm burning another grit for my final shot.
Laura: Does grit give you advantage?
Matt: He can burn a grit to get advantage on a shot, if he wants to.
Taliesin: Yeah, I can do a lot of things with it, but he's so big, this is my best shot, because his AC is so fucking high. That's 31 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Marisha: Did you have disadvantage on it?
Taliesin: And that's 16 points of damage and one point of psychic damage.
Matt: All right, so those are your shots.
Taliesin: And I'm running towards that fire pit, straight back.
Matt: This way. You're going to have to leap over lava.
Taliesin: I can't whirl around it?
Matt: If you want to go around it, you can go (counting).
Taliesin: That'll do.
Matt: All right, there you go. All right, that ends Percival's turn. Death saving throw, with advantage.
Liam: Good, natural 20.
Matt: You're fine. Actually, you stabilize. You're fine. End of your turn. It's now the forge guardian's turn.
Taliesin: Is he blind? Is he still blind?
Matt: Well, he's not conscious, and currently you are still blind, yeah.
Liam: Am I at zero hit points and stable, or one hit point and stable?
Matt: Zero hit points and stable.
Liam: Love it.
Travis: One hit point. Zero is unconscious.
Matt: You don't have to make the death saving throws anymore.
Laura: Oh, but you're still unconscious.
Matt: No, you regain one hit point if you roll a 20! You're right!
Liam: But we're not at the top of the round, right? We're still mid-round, correct?
Matt: Correct. So you're conscious now, though your vision, you open your eyes, and there's still darkness, but you're conscious. All right. The forge guardian does not regain his blade storm. He's going to make two melee attacks against you, Grog, since you've given him the option. Actually, he's going to go ahead and leap a little bit, to land here, not enough to give you an attack of opportunity. It's going to make one strike at you, Grog, and another kick attack at Scanlan.
Liam: Kick a gnome?
Taliesin: Gnome-kicking is a time-honored tradition.
Matt: 31, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, that hits. I'll take the retaliation after, as well.
Matt: 34 points of slashing damage. Down to 17. And Scanlan, that is 28 to hit.
Sam: That hits.
Matt: You take 24 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: I will reduce that with Cutting Words.
Marisha: He's about to go down, isn't he?
Matt: All right, so reduced, so roll a d12. This is your last bardic inspiration, so you're done with this now.
Sam: d12. Six.
Matt: Okay. So take six damage off of that.
Sam: What was the damage? I don't think you said.
Matt: I thought I did, but I don't remember.
Sam: You rolled a 20-something to hit, but I don't think you said damage.
Matt: That's fine. I can't remember. Okay. (counting) 25 points, reduced, so you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage as it kicks you, and you are pushed 15 feet back.
Liam: Past the lava!
Marisha: Past the lava!
Travis: Skipping across!
Marisha: Please tell me you're not unconscious.
Matt: So Scanlan, you immediately are kicked back into the molten rock and iron. That is 61 points of fire damage.
Laura: Did he go under? Tell me you're not unconscious.
Sam: I'm unconscious.
Matt: Scanlan is now on fire, and (sizzling) he's T-800-ing.
Travis: Can I take my retaliation attack?
Matt: You can.
Travis: Reckless, great weapon master.
Laura: I think I can get him out.
Travis: 34 minus five. 29.
Matt: That hits. Roll damage on that.
Travis: 23, 33.
Matt: 33 damage. By the way, at the top of its turn, it also took 17 points of damage from your hemorrhaging shot. It's looking rough now. It's looking pretty rough. All right, so that finishes that turn. End of his turn, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Yeah. Okay. All right, can I get to Scanlan from my position on the map?
Liam: Movement, dash, action to grab him.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to pick him up.
Matt: All right, so you glide down and you grab his body, and you lift him up, and you get him out of the lava but that's as much movement as you've got.
Laura: Can I use my action to--
Matt: It's your action to grab and pull him out.
Laura: Can I use my bonus action to dash away?
Matt: You can. I'll say you move half speed because you're having to bring him with you.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to back up.
Matt: So you can get both of you guys back up to wherever you want to go.
Laura: Into the corner.
Matt: Into the corner? So you get about there.
Laura: At least I got him out of the lava.
Liam: I have had a jackrabbit knee under the table for ten minutes.
Laura: But that's it? That's everything.
Matt: All right, so that ends Vex's turn. Top of the round, Scanlan, you immediately take fire damage because you're still on fire, so you immediately fail a death saving throw.
Sam: But I have some sort of Death Ward on me.
Matt: You do have Death Ward on you! So as you go and reach and grab him and pull him up, the Death Ward flickers on and he comes back to one hit point. You pull him off to the side. As soon as his turn comes up, he takes seven points of fire damage and now goes to zero.
Marisha: He didn't fail a death saving throw.
Matt: The Death Ward has expired.
Liam: Point of clarification. We're at the top of the round, so I just went from one hit point to two hit points.
Matt: Yeah, I think so, actually. Well, it's the top of your turn, so yeah. Let me double check on that.
Liam: Safe at two. No one can touch me.
Travis: Yeah, you're all good.
Matt: All righty, so that brings us from Scanlan's turn to the elemental's turn. The elemental is going to go ahead and (whoosh).
Sam: This overlay thing's pretty cool.
Liam: Yeah, right? It makes remote play not quite as removed.
Sam: Can we have a hologram version of that in front of us all the time?
Travis: Yeah, right here.
Marisha: Yeah, counting our hit points for us?
Sam: That we can see, I mean.
Matt: That is 13 against your armor class. Does not hit. And 14 does not hit. It has the blindness on the elemental, still.
Travis: Super cute elemental, chasing me like a puppy.
Matt: Ending that elemental's turn. It is now Grog and Keyleth's turn.
Travis: I'll go. Turn straight at him, reckless, great weapon master.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: That's going to be enough. Come on, crit. No. Okay.
Matt: Technically, sorry, before we get to that, at the end of its turn, at the end of the elemental's turn, it's going to go ahead and strike you with its blade.
Travis: Okay. I'm going to keep that roll just in case something happens.
Matt: No worries. That's a 27 to hit.
Travis: Which it does.
Matt: 36 points of slashing damage, reduced to half, so that's 18. And make a constitution saving throw, please.
Marisha: I have four as my planetar, so I've got two more of those that I just did, in terms of myself. I'm trying to keep tabs.
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24? Yeah, you resist the blindness. So your turn, unabated as you were before.
Travis: Right. Minus five, is 31 to hit.
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Travis: It was a great roll. And the second one is pretty big. 34 minus five is 29.
Matt: That hits, yeah. Both do damage.
Liam: Let me do a little roleplay here. Oh, baby!
Travis: 17 plus ten is 27 for the first one. Oh, nope. I'm sorry! That was a one, so I'm going to re-roll it. Five, 21, 31 for the first one. Second one. Three, 29, and my fucking necrotic dice. Two, four more.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: That does. Actually, can I move? I'm going to stay in melee, but I want to come over here in case he decides to golf-swing me into the fucking lava river.
Matt: Sure. It's going to use its second legendary action to attack you, as soon as you move around, it's going to sweep low and attempt to try and cleave you in half. With the advantage against you, natural 20. (screaming)
Taliesin: Knock it off!
Matt: That reckless attack, man. He gets advantage on all his attacks against him.
Travis: That's the reason I roll so high most of the time.
Marisha: Yeah, you kill them before they can retaliate.
Matt: 73 points of slashing damage. On 3d12, it was a ten, eight, and a 12.
Marisha: What was it, 76?
Travis: So that's 37?
Matt: It's 20, 30, times two, 60, plus 13. So 73. So half of that would be 36, we'll say. 36 points of slashing damage, and make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it.
Travis: Yeah, 24.
Matt: 24, okay. Resisting it still.
Travis: I can still see?
Matt: Yeah, you can still see. All right, Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. You can still see? Everyone's good? You're up? Everyone's up?
Laura: Scanlan's dead. Unconscious.
Marisha: You're with him. He's fine. I'm going to fly over. 120 feet. I've got a five-foot reach range. I'm going to do my multiattack as my planetar. So two hits, with plus two. I'm going to do Gil.
Liam: Come on, Captain Planet!
Travis: We just had three fights in the same day.
Marisha: Goddamn. That's a natural 19 on one, and a natural 16 on the other! Plus 12 for both of those.
Matt: Yeah, those both hit.
Marisha: Okay, and then for both of those, 4d6 plus seven, and an additional 5d8 radiant damage.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Kiki, it's yours.
Laura: Kill it!
Marisha: Okay, for the d6s alone. Okay, that's six plus four, that's ten plus another five, 15, plus three is 18.
Matt: 18 plus seven. 25?
Marisha: I'm just doing the d6s. 25, and then, not as great the second time.
Taliesin: Do you re-roll those?
Marisha: No, not for this. Only elemental damage. So five, six, seven, plus another seven, so 14.
Matt: 14, okay, and then now 10d8 radiant damage.
Marisha: Now 10d8 radiant damage. I may just roll these twice, okay, so the first one. Okay, ten plus seven, so 17, plus another seven is 24 radiant, and then (counting) 19 damage. Radiant damage.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (shouting)
Matt: As you rush across the room, rushing towards it, and strike out towards it, what do you want to do?
Marisha: Okay. (grunts) As I look around, see all my friends, blind and running around insane, I'm going to go (yells) and fly across the field, and come down with a big radiant strike, and try and invoke in the back of my head, (singing) Hallelujah! And (grunts).
Matt: As you arc down with your weapon, the holy, divine energy spraying off of the strike, the arc slams into the center of the guardian's chest, and you watch as the armor expands and explodes. You see this core in the center that previously has been guarded by its stone form, and there on the inside you see this beating red gem that (power-down sound) goes cold. As it does, the guardian drops the blade (footsteps) and walks to the other side of the chamber, pieces of its armor falling off to the ground. You see cracked parts of its outer form breaking off in small chunks of shale, and it makes its way to the opposite side, walking around, carefully, each of you. It takes and places its blade (crashing) up on this stand on the wall, turns around, and goes completely inert.
Laura: Whoa. It was a trial. You had to be able to beat him in order to forge here. I'm putting Scanlan out! Because he's still on fire.
Matt: Okay. Scanlan is still on fire.
Laura: Scanlan is not on fire anymore.
Travis: Is he unconscious still?
Laura: He's still unconscious, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at level one, because that's what I can do, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on him to bring him back to life.
Marisha: Okay, and then I fly over, (whoosh), and do my other healing touch on Vax.
Matt: How many healing touches does he have?
Marisha: Four.
Liam: Wait. I don't need it. Wait.
Laura: So six points, Scanlan, that's what you've got.
Liam: The massive gash across my entire body, as you stand there for 30 seconds, starts to close.
Marisha: Cool. (whoosh) I go over to Scanlan and do a healing touch. 6d8. (counting) Can you give me one more d8? Okay. Scanlan, you have 14, 15, 26. You heal 26 plus three, so 29 hit points.
Sam: Thank you.
Marisha: And you're cured from any diseases. Is anyone else blind or rough?
Liam: That's gone as soon as he's done fighting.
Matt: Yes, the blindness has faded.
Marisha: I have one more of these if anyone else needs healing.
Travis: I'm in double digits, which is uncomfortable for me.
Laura: Yeah, you're low double digits, too!
Marisha: You're low double digits? (whoosh)
Matt: Where are you at?
Travis: 53.
Marisha: I drop same thing into Grog.
Travis: Yeah, I got my ass handed to me. Two crits by that giant bastard.
Matt: That reckless, man. That's the downside.
Travis: I know. I'll take, though. It's worth the gamble.
Marisha: (counting) You get 37 hit points.
Matt: The first part of this fight, he was sucking. It was like, two, three, three, two, and then he picked up. All righty. So in the silence, as you guys take a moment to breathe and recover, the uncomfortable heat in here is sweltering. The guardian is motionless across the forge. The blade is set up against the wall, now obscured by the smoke that's still billowing up across the back wall. Getting a better glance around, you can see a lot of the soot and black that has gathered in the upper areas of the ceiling, which is about 50 feet high. There you see, faintly glowing and obscuring the air above it, the Core Anvil, the chains still held taut as the various blacksmithing implements hang dangling off the sides of the central platform.
Travis: Well, that was a bitch. What do you say we cut to the chase and hammer this shit out?
Laura: I hope he won't come back to life as soon as we start.
Marisha: Is my elemental still going rogue?
Matt: I will say at this point, because the elemental took quite a bit of damage, that you guys quickly dispatch it. I don't want to have to worry about you guys killing a blind elemental. It's fine. No longer blind, but still. (splat) It's gone.
Marisha: Keyleth goes Mickey in Fantasia for a second, and she's the axe to the brooms, killing my creation.
Travis: There's a big splash up against the wall, but it's just water.
Taliesin: Sam, your inspiration is a long rest recharge, not a short rest, right?
Matt: Short rest.
Taliesin: Oh! If we take a short rest, he can inspire us when we do this.
Laura: Yeah, we should probably, if we can, take a short rest.
Liam: That's a half hour? Yeah, that was hard.
Taliesin: I want to sit down.
Laura: Just so you guys can think about your process, know exactly what you're doing.
Taliesin: We do need to discuss this.
Matt: While you guys are taking a short rest, you can heal up with your hit dice. I also need everyone to make a constitution saving throw, please, because it's so hot in here.
Liam: Do I, with the fire on the Deathwalker's Ward?
Marisha: Yeah. And me with the mantle?
Matt: This is a little more than the usual mantle. I'll say you have to make it, as well, Vax, just make it with advantage.
Marisha: Do I get with advantage because of the mantle or no?
Taliesin: 18.
Travis: 21.
Laura: 19.
Liam: 25.
Marisha: 14.
Laura: Scanlan?
Sam: I rolled that poop thing again.
Matt: So both Scanlan and Keyleth gain a point of exhaustion.
Sam: Wait, do I get advantage? No, I don't know.
Matt: You do not.
Laura: You got a lot of hit dice that you can roll.
Travis: I do, but still. Four.
Matt: Your constitution modifier is?
Travis: Five.
Taliesin: And now I'm up to top again, and it only took two hit dice. And then I get my heal back. I get my action surges back. Grit comes back on a short rest.
Laura: I'm back to 144.
Liam: Back at the temporary 137, due to the feast.
Taliesin: I'm going to really quickly fix Bad News. All right, I fixed Bad News.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: Wow. And so many things don't work anymore. Okay. Yeah.
Matt: What's wrong now?
Taliesin: Oh, my Hex is burned, my Spider Climb's burned, Diplomacy is a long rest before that goes again.
Matt: So you guys finish your short rest. What do you want to do in the chamber? You have the whole chamber at your disposal.
Travis: I would like to go to the top where the Core Anvil is and start pulling up each of the tools that are hanging by the four chains.
Matt: Okay. You find numerous sets of tongs. You find twisting tools. You find metal punches. You find chisels of all sizes. You see a form of leg vise that's laying at the side of the anvil which you know immediately, weirdly for you, a leg vise is a small device that you use to clamp metal onto the anvil to work on it. You use your foot to hold down with pressure. You also see the hammer that was chained to it, as well, which is very well made. The dark black hammer metal look with gold inlay. It looks like scrolling all across it in places. All these different tools are all chained to the actual sides of the anvil.
Travis: Can I tell what material the black part of the hammer is made out of? If it's rock, metal, some sort of volcanic glass?
Matt: It appears to be metal.
Laura: So these trammels need to be made out of platinum. You know how to do it, right?
Taliesin: No, I know how to do it.
Laura: Okay. So what do we do?
Travis: I have the chunks of platinum. I hand the chunks of platinum over to Percy to put the-- I guess they don't have to be in--
Taliesin: We're going to have to smelt them.
Laura: They're going to be melted.
Travis: So we should do that, right?
Taliesin: We're going to have to start with smelting them. Well, I don't know. You know the process, I don't. Why am I in character talking to the dungeon master? What's happening? Ah, the meta.
Matt: You understand, based on the discussion you guys had between the design, the platinum has to be smelted down into workable bars, ingots of metal that can be hammered and folded. You have to get into the chamber to do so because the smelting materials are in the chamber you just came from. This is the forging chamber. The other doors are still closed. Once they're made into bars, and this is from the design that you recall Ioun gave you, the beads of divinity that you've been given, you have to actually shatter across the anvil and then fold the pieces into the metal.
Travis: Cool.
Matt: Once that's done then you actually have a solid blank of platinum inlaid with the fragments of divinity. You then have to draw out the trammel tips, which makes them into a fine point like a long javelin-like rod. Then you have to use the vise, after heating the metal, to twist the trammels. The actual design has them twisted because it helps conduct the divine energy to the point. And then using the chiseling tools, you have to work in the runes that match and channel the incantation that Scanlan's book has. It's a multi-process step that's going to require both of you to work together on this, since some elements of it are blacksmithing elements, some of it are tinkering.
Laura: So we have to get into the other room first before we do any of that. Can I fly over and see if I can find any kind of apparatus that would--
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: Going with her to do the same. Investigation?
Laura: 30.
Matt: So 30. You glance up and you see it looks there like there were two chains that were originally down held on a crank device. However, the chain has been cut and the other half of it is about 20 feet up in the air.
Laura: Okay. And I'm assuming that I'm not strong enough to pull on that chain, right? I can try. I'm going to try.
Liam: Why don't you and I try?
Laura: Yeah, but you can't fly anymore.
Marisha: I can, though. I still have wings.
Laura: You fly on one and I'll try to get the other one.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So planetar form. Go ahead and make a strength check, please.
Marisha: I am looking right now. My strength is 24, so plus seven. (scoffs) Again. Why again with the threes?
Taliesin: Put that one away.
Marisha: Ten.
Laura: Oh, I rolled a 13.
Matt: You two tug on those chains, and they are not moving.
Laura: Can the guardian do it? Hey, you that was attacking us. Can you get those chains?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: (laughs) Really? Yeah, it wasn't a very persuasive thing to say. 14.
Matt: 14? It makes no motion, change, nothing.
Liam: Shorthalt, you got any Bigby's left in you?
Sam: I could do one if we really need it. What's wrong with Grog? He can't do it?
Laura: It's too high.
Liam: He could do one. We could get him up there.
Marisha: Is the end of the chain able to where I can pull to at least make it reach Grog or no?
Matt: No, you don't have the strength to pull it down, not with that strength check, unfortunately.
Liam: Can you Bigby one and maybe Vex can slowly pull Grog up to that thing on your broom?
Laura: Or she could probably lift Grog up.
Marisha: Can I fly Grog up?
Matt: Yeah. You can lift him up. (grunts) It takes you a minute and it's a slow pull. You feel the veins bulging on your blue-skinned forehead. (grunts)
Travis: Kicking my feet, which doesn't make it any easier.
Marisha: Dog-paddling.
Matt: But you do get up, Grog, and you grab the chain. Make a strength check.
Travis: I'm not still raging, unfortunately.
Matt: You can still be raging if you want to.
Laura: You're very angry about it.
Travis: 23.
Matt: As you lift him up, you grab the chain and rappelling down, you begin to find places in the stonework and metal on the side and hold on with your other hand, pull. As you do, you watch the wall on the opposite side (scraping) move up on one side a little bit and get stuck.
Sam: Should I Bigby the other?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: All right. I'll have to do it at level seven.
Marisha: Oh shit. We're so tapped out.
Matt: So Bigby's Hand appears, (whoosh) rushes up to the other chain. Go ahead and make a d20 roll and add an eight to it.
Sam: 21.
Matt: As Bigby pulls the other side, the wall on the opposite side adjusts and both chains now, Grog and Bigby's Hand together, pull and pull and pull and slowly, as you're both pulling across the metal and dragging it downward, the opposite wall (scraping). Opens up.
Sam: Oh wait. Is this an ability check?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: I'm exhausted.
Taliesin: Bigby isn't, though.
Matt: Bigby isn't. It's a check for the spell, not for you. So together you both eventually bring the chains to the bottom and you find one of the number of hooks on the floor area where you can wrap it around to hold it in place. It's tenuous but it's holding. And so the large metal door on the opposite side is currently now held up about 13 feet up. It's only partway up right now but that's all you need at the moment.
Marisha: Can Grog and them let go? Is it going to slam shut?
Matt: They found large rings and hooks to hook them onto.
Travis: We hurry to the other room.
Taliesin: We hurry to the other room. If we can get any inspiration, too, before we start this process.
Laura: There's no inspiration-- Oh, no, he rested. Yeah.
Matt: Short rest, so he has his inspiration back.
Taliesin: Let's just smelt for now.
Marisha: And now I can do my concentration. Let me burn another spell. I'm doing Cat's Grace on you. That fell to the wayside before.
Matt: You have advantage on dexterity-based ability checks.
Travis: Oh that's right, that's the one. Thank you.
Matt: So. Let's see here. Grog, Percival. You head to the original chamber before this. You find the tongs and some of the metallic ingot-based molds. You take in pieces of platinum equal to the amounts you guys had pulled up before. How much was it?
Laura: 300 platinum each.
Matt: That was for the face. For the trammels.
Laura: Oh. Would those little pyramids work to make the trammels? Or it needs more?
Matt: Well, no. There's other molds there with the smelting device.
Laura: I got 4,920 platinum.
Matt: If I recall, it was 1,500 platinum per piece, I believe.
Travis: So 4,500. So enough for three trammels.
Matt: So you guys made the platinum transition when you were in Vasselheim. And the reason it takes so much is because even the natural platinum that's out there has some impurities in the process of the creating so you guys have to repeatedly go through and burn and pull out impure segments of the metals that come to the top.
Laura: Make sure you use some of those pyramids we made, though.
Marisha: Yeah, so we don't waste that platinum that we melted into triangles.
Matt: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a blacksmithing tool check. This is with proficiency bonus. It should be dexterity for this.
Taliesin: At which you have advantage.
Travis: Which I have advantage.
Matt: Correct. So you'd roll twice.
Laura: 1,500 per trammel? Of platinum. Okay. We're fine. Yeah. Can you get your calculator out? Never mind. I can do this it myself.
Taliesin: Yeah, figure out what dex plus proficiency. Whatever your dex plus prof is.
Travis: Oh, advantage. Right. I got it. 19.
Sam: Oh, do you want me to inspire you or anything? Do you all need anything?
Taliesin: How long does inspiration last for?
Matt: Up to ten minutes.
Taliesin: Let's wait until the final--
Matt: All right. So. It takes you a good 20 minutes or so, 30 minutes or so per ingot to get all the impurities out, to heat it and to scoop it out. Eventually gets so you can form three bars of pure platinum to the level that you know the requirements of the trammel are. You look around. You don't see any areas here to cool the metal. You didn't get a good look at the other chamber necessarily to see if there was something for it.
Travis: I still have the Alchemy Jug with the water in it.
Laura: You might shatter that jug.
Taliesin: There's probably everything we need in here if we take a look around.
Marisha: Do you need water?
Taliesin: We're going to need water.
Laura: Can I fly around and see what we can see?
Matt: Sure. You glance around and there's the two machines over there that are still (crashing). Behind and in the center of the two machines you do see a trough about eight feet on one side and three feet the width of it. It is empty, however.
Marisha: I go over and cast Create Water.
Matt: You manage to fill the trough, brimming with cool, instantly created water.
Laura: We've got a trough!
Matt: Back and forth, you guys take the molds with tongs and (sizzling) quench the metal and pull out the three heavy platinum ingots, ready for use on the actual anvil.
Liam: This just turned into an Aerosmith video.
Matt: (laughter) So. Now that you're working on the forge, you have your Gauntlets on. The two of you walk up and you have all these tools around you. To fold the metal, you're going to need the hammer. So you grab the hammer and the hammer's pretty big. It's like a maul. It's a two-handed hammer.
Travis: I love this.
Matt: You need the beads of divinity for this next stage.
Travis: Who's got the beads?
Laura: I've got a bead.
Sam: I've got a bead.
Matt: So you take the Ioun one, which has a faint whitish-gray glow, and place it in the center of the anvil. Go ahead and make a strength check, Grog.
Travis: Can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: (heavy breathing) That's even better. 25.
Matt: 25. With a giant echoing yell, (grunts) you bring the hammer down and you watch a flash of bright, vibrant white, faintly blue light flicker and beam across the room. All of you for a second have to hold your eyes and look away and as you come back, the hammer is on top of the anvil. As you pull it back, you see, where the bead was, there is now a crushed dust of the same color, roughly about the size of a plate. None of it's scattered away from the anvil, it is a crystalline diamond-like powder that remains.
Travis: Do we fold this into one of the ingots? One at a time?
Taliesin: One at a time.
Matt: All right. So with you holding the tongs and helping him, you take the hammer. I need you to make a blacksmithing tool check.
Taliesin: With advantage.
Matt: This is with strength, on this one. This is hammering the metal and folding it into the metal.
Travis: That is a 19.
Matt: 19's fine. The hammering isn't too hard. The different things have different difficulties, and so the folding isn't too bad. So with that, you guys take the dust and you scatter it across the metal and then hammer and fold, hammer and fold and take more and scatter it across the metal as it's still heated. Hammer and fold, then go and take it off to the side to two of the coal areas, and you watch as the furnaces burn and heat the metal up again. You bring it back up to the steps and hammer and fold, hammer and fold with more of it until eventually, you've managed to hammer in over the next 20 or so minutes, both of you sweating, feeling a little bit of stiffness and soreness in your arms from this process, but you've been far worse.
Laura: We're cheering them on the side. Good forging! Fold that metal.
Matt: You eventually build a rod blank for your first trammel using the bead of divinity from Ioun. That is complete. So who's next?
Travis: Whose bead is up next?
Laura: Oh god. All right, here we go.
Matt: All right. So you take the faintly yellowish-glowing bead of divinity from the Dawnfather, place it onto the anvil. Make another strength check, please.
Laura: Does he need inspiration?
Travis: Persistent rage. I'm raging balls this whole time.
Matt: Do you still have an inspiration on you right now?
Travis: I do not.
Laura: Scanlan?
Sam: Do you want me to inspire you?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: All right, I will-- I go up to Grog and I tell him: Grog, I'm going to tell you some words of wisdom that I learned from a book once. A wise man said, "The man who hast smelted verily didst also dealt it."
Travis: Wisdom. Unparalleled wisdom!
Matt: So with advantage, and you're still raging on this.
Travis: Oh, that's amazing. Yeah. 25.
Matt: 25 again.
Travis: 17 plus eight.
Matt: Both times you've hit 25, and the DC on this is 25 on the sheet here. So with Pelor's bead of divinity, you (crash) slam down a second time. This time, you guys see a flash like you stare into the sun for a split second. The heat in the room grows even warmer for a moment, and it's like being on the outside of a Meteor Swarm blast, which you all recall very distinctly. You come back and pull the hammer away, and there you see the scattering dust of the Dawnfather's blessed bead. The two of you then go ahead and take in the next ingot and begin. You heat it up, bring it back to the anvil and begin to fold, scatter, fold, scatter, reheat, bring back, fold, scatter. Repeating the process until you get all through it. I need you to go ahead and make another blacksmithing tool check.
Travis: Advantage because of the Cat's Grace. It's a 19.
Matt: This is strength, still.
Travis: Oh, it is?
Matt: Yeah. I'll tell you if it's dex or strength because you're hammering the metal. He's turning it over.
Travis: 27.
Matt: 27. Yeah. Without an issue, you guys manage to fold in your second trammel blank without worry. Bringing you to the third one, the third and final.
Travis: Bead.
Matt: Producing and placing onto the anvil, Vax, you leave behind there the small jet black smooth oval bead.
Travis: I reach into my pouch and I take out one of my peas that I got, and I put it on the anvil.
Laura: Don't do it. Get it off of there, Grog.
Matt: Strength check, Grog.
Travis: Raging strength check. Okay. It's inspiration time.
Sam: Inspiration time?
Travis: I'm going to use the dice.
Marisha: Because you didn't use it before?
Laura: No, he hasn't used it. (gasps)
Travis: It's a 24.
Matt: 24. (clang) You slam down. And you pull back the hammer, and there it remains. Unshattered.
Laura: Try it again.
Travis: But my arms are really sore. I need a massage.
Laura: I'm going to over and rub his muscles.
Liam: Grog, if you do this I will give you something really cool. Really cool.
Travis: By whose standards, yours or mine?
Liam: Yours.
Travis: All right.
Laura: Do you want to inspire him again, Scanlan?
Sam: Yes, I do. I will sing to him. (singing) Pour some platinum on thee and get it on an anvil. Pour some platinum on thee when you need a trammel!
Matt: Take your d12. All right, Grog, as you try again, pulling the large maul hammer up.
Travis: No. Come on, Gil. That's dog shit.
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: I'm not even going to use the inspiration because it won't get us there.
Laura: Try one more time. Can he try again?
Travis: Well, now hold on. I would have to roll a 12. Of a d12.
Sam: You'd have to roll a 12?
Laura: Try it, though.
Matt: It's up to you.
Travis: Ten.
Laura: Oh, motherfuck.
Matt: (impact) You slam down with a second hit. As it hits, the reverberation of the impact fills the room. You pull the hammer back and there it remains, but you do see a mild crack through its form.
Travis: (panting) I'll try one more time. One more. No inspiration.
Marisha: Can I do anything to help him?
Taliesin: No. Let's just do it.
Marisha: Can I give him Guidance?
Laura: Do you get any more inspiration, Scanlan?
Sam: Sure. Yeah, I can inspire one more time.
Travis: Hold on. Let me try it without the inspiration. Let me try.
Matt: If you give him Guidance, it will give him an additional d4 he gets to add.
Marisha: But it would get rid of his Cat's Grace, but you're not using it.
Matt: Oh yeah, because it's concentration.
Travis: Let me do it straight up.
Marisha: It's a cantrip. I'm going to give you Guidance! I'm doing it! Guidance!
Matt: So as you're doing this, Keyleth comes up behind and then touches you.
Marisha: Come on, Grog! Come on! That's my Guidance.
Travis: I didn't need it. 25 on the dot.
Marisha: Good.
Matt: What could have been only two trammels, you barely manage to succeed in properly shattering and not ruining the third bead. (impact) As you slam, all of you for a second see nothing but darkness. All the light, all the flame, even the heat of the room goes jet cold for an instant. And all of a sudden, the light of the furnaces flicker back on, the machine once more (crushing). The engine slams and light filters back. You pull the hammer back. You see a scattering of darkened coal, obsidian dust remaining behind.
Travis: I've never been so happy to see a 17 before. Oh my god.
Liam: Work that Play-Doh. Come on.
Matt: With that, you two holding the tongs, you take and fold the metal, hammer it, fold the metal, hammer it. Make another blacksmithing check. Go ahead and make your final blank.
Laura: Okay, but now you can add things.
Travis: I've got advantage. Is it strength or dex?
Matt: This is strength still, this one.
Marisha: You still have Guidance.
Travis: But I get a d4 on top of it? Oh, that's great. 26 without the other stuff.
Matt: Without an issue. So with that, you fold and you have your three finished trammel blanks, each one infused with the bead of divinity. Now you need to draw them out. And you can do these as one check for the three of them. So you go in and you take these blanks, these long rods, and you heat up the tip and bring it back, you holding with the tongs. You begin to, at an angle, hammering it against the top of the anvil, to eventually bring it to a gradual point. I need you to go ahead and make a blacksmithing check. This will be dexterity because this is less of just hammering, this is a little more careful manipulation of the metal. Did you cast Cat's Grace on him again? Because if you don't, it's not advantage.
Marisha: Cat's Grace.
Travis: Then I'll keep that. And then what was the Guidance? Do I have Guidance any more?
Matt: No, you can't have both.
Marisha: Do you want advantage or do you want that extra d4?
Taliesin: Advantage.
Laura: So he can still add one d4 on this?
Marisha: Pick one.
Travis: It's a 15 with advantage.
Matt: It's a 15?
Sam: Shall I inspire him?
Matt: Well, you have to inspire him before he makes the check.
Travis: Because it's my dexterity modifier plus my proficiency bonus, right?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Can I help with this?
Matt: You are helping with this.
Taliesin: Oh god. Okay.
Matt: (laughs) We'll get to you shortly. So as you begin to hammer it out, it's getting a little fragile at some points. I'll let you make one more check so you don't ruin one of the trammels.
Travis: Advantage, right?
Taliesin: Advantage and inspiration.
Sam: Sure. Yeah, I'll inspire him again.
Laura: He needs as much as you can give him, Scanlan.
Sam: I will give him every inch of myself.
Laura: So one? (laughter)
Sam: One by one by one, yeah.
Travis: My god. That's better. Okay. That's a 24. Should I use the inspiration?
Sam: Yes, you should.
Travis: 29.
Matt: 29. So this time, seeing where the imperfections were in the hammering you initially did and curving and bringing fragility to one of the trammels, you double back, heat up, and correct the mistake. Over the next ten minutes or so, you both carefully work to bring each to a razor point at the end of these large platinum javelins now. They're thicker on one side and come to an impossible point at the other. You have three of these base trammels now complete.
Laura: Now we got to twist them?
Travis: No, we got to put the runes in.
Matt: So now you have to twist them. This is where you bring up the leg vice. So you go ahead and you clamp it in there. This is without your help. This is now you taking and heating the metal and twisting it as you go, so make another blacksmithing check.
Marisha: I can guide you. I can do nothing else.
Matt: This is a dexterity-based.
Marisha: Oh, it's dexterity still? Then keep the advantage. You have advantage.
Travis: (sobbing) I'm tired of this.
Laura: Does he have any more inspiration?
Sam: Sure. I can inspire him.
Laura: Wait, keep inspiring.
Taliesin: He already rolled.
Laura: But he hasn't announced it.
Matt: He already rolled.
Travis: It's a 26. It's okay.
Matt: So with that, you, one by one, slowly using the clamp, twist, heat it up, grab, clamp, twist, hammer, twist and continue this process for each trammel as everyone looks on with bated breath. The deafening sound of the engine-like contraptions fill the space like a heartbeat. Their rhythm gets into your muscles and the aches begin to fade as you focus on the hammers in unison with the (slamming). Becomes this very primal forging-of-the-world vision to see Grog atop this anvil for over an hour at this point now, sweating and hammering away at these trammels. A vision of the Allhammer once, long ago, forging weapons of old, long-forgotten and lost, now Grog sits here, forging the means of sealing one of the biggest threats to the Prime Material Plane by himself. As you finish twisting the final trammel, you pull it up (sizzling), quenching them in the water that you left behind. And as you pull up, you can see as the steam rises, the three twisted javelins of pure platinum ready for the final scrolling.
Travis: (panting) Okay. Okay, give me the cool thing.
Liam: I don't want to do that with everybody here. I'm not lying to you. It's really cool.
Travis: I'm too tired to be upset about it.
Liam: Later. I promise.
Marisha: What do you--
Taliesin: Well, let's see. What do I have to do?
Matt: The only hammer here is that maul, but all the chiseling and tinkering work takes a much smaller, more delicate hammer.
Travis: I do have the Dwarven Thrower.
Matt: It's going to have to be a smaller edge than that.
Laura: Like what? Whisper?
Liam: Edge? Yeah?
Matt: It has to be a hammer.
Marisha: Like a rock hammer.
Laura: Can we look around for a little teeny hammer?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: Teeny hammer?
Laura: 12 for me, so probably not so much.
Taliesin: Make an investigation check?
Travis: Me too.
Liam: 18 for me.
Taliesin: Glad I got that roll out of the way.
Travis: 15?
Matt: Looking around, all the other tools are for different things, but there's no other hammer. There's the one singular giant hammer on the chain.
Laura: Have you picked it up? Maybe it changes shape.
Taliesin: I'm going to try picking the hammer up.
Matt: Okay. You pick up the hammer.
Taliesin: I'm going to try and attune to it.
Matt: So you take a bit of time to attune with it, if you feel that's something you could try.
Taliesin: I'm going to examine it.
Matt: Okay. Make an arcana check.
Taliesin: Make another arcana check. Let's see what happens. Oh, that's better. 21.
Matt: 21. This is definitely an enchanted hammer. You take time with it and focus, and once you feel the essence of attunement begin to drift into this hammer, you unattune from one of your other items and you will it. The hammer actually (shrinking) shrinks down into a small, light hammer. Ball-peen hammer.
Travis: Smart move.
Taliesin: I'll drop Animus for now.
Marisha: Your coffee-stained artifacts.
Liam: I dropped my travel mug.
Matt: So. Now with this tinier hammer in your grasp, you walk over and put the trammels on the anvil. You grab some of the chiseling implements, and the two of you together begin to work. And you're mainly there taking the hammer and driving the back of the chisel while he's guiding the design because you don't know what vision he has. So you've done all the groundwork. You've built the structure, the base plate for it. But you have all the intricate designs in the head that Ioun imparted with you. So now you almost go into a trance with the chiseling tools and you have three in your hands and you're juggling them behind and you're staring ahead. It's really weird to watch Percival go from this focused individual to staring off into space and his hands take over and begins moving the chisels along. Each one of them almost too fast for you to keep up and you get to the point where you're like (rapid hammering). Trying to keep up with him as he's moving along. As you do, you watch as this intricate scrolling begins to appear and dig itself into the side of each trammel. He rotates it with the tongs, moves into place, gets the chisel and removes it, rotates it again and as this continues, it gets faster and faster and faster. I need you to go ahead to make a tinkering check.
Marisha: Do you want any Guidance?
Taliesin: Oh, I'll take anything I can get.
Laura: Cat's Grace is what, dexterity?
Taliesin: Well, technically that's a dex check, so if you have Cat's Grace I'll take it.
Marisha: Is it a dex check?
Matt: It's what you gave to Grog earlier.
Marisha: Okay. Then I will give you Cat's Grace at third level because my 2nd-level spells are tapped. And so are now my 3rd-level spells. Nothing more.
Taliesin: If you have any inspiration, I'll also take it.
Sam: Yes, sure. I'll give you some. I will sing to you. I will sing: (singing) bang bang, Percy's ball-peen hammer goes down, upon the ground! Bang bang, Percy's ball-peen hammer makes a really, really big sound. (vocalizing)
Matt: The actual heat from the Core Anvil is enough that when you hold the trammel against it, it gives it just enough of a malleable edge for you to go ahead and chisel through it without issue. As you're going, it's three checks: one for each trammel. So the first one?
Taliesin: That's without inspiration. That's 31.
Matt: 31. (skittering, clanging) After about five minutes or so, you finish and grab one of the trammels and (clang) onto the ground. Begin on the other. (skittering)
Travis: Slow down!
Taliesin: (groan)
Marisha: (groan)
Marisha: Try again. Inspiration it?
Taliesin: I might be able to inspiration this because that was a really bad roll. Both of them are the same. Both of them are two. And this is not one of those things where I can fix. It's either good or it's bad.
Laura: We might be able to fix it.
Taliesin: I'm going to try and add a little bit of inspiration, maybe.
Marisha: (groans)
Taliesin: That's not very good. That's 17.
Matt: 17. Okay. The second trammel, as you're chiseling along, you feel as the metal (cracking) begins to bend and snap in one place. It's still one piece. (sighs) The DC has gone up, but you get one more shot at that one.
Taliesin: Can I get one more inspiration if you got any? Are you out?
Sam: I've used five, and I think I get six.
Taliesin: Let's take another one. Just in case because Jesus fucking Christ.
Matt: The DC was 20. Now it's 25.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: If this fails, it's going to break a trammel.
Laura: Oh my god!
Taliesin: Please. I will happily take that inspiration, please.
Sam: All right. I will inspire you with some bullshit.
Marisha: No one has any other type of Guidance or anything?
Laura: I'm looking. I've got nothing.
Travis: I don't have anything; I just hit things!
Taliesin: It's a skill check. It's not a save. Oh wait. I don't get to add anything from the hammer for this?
Matt: No. The hammer is allowing the process to take place.
Liam: Do we need to do this right now? Can we take nappies and come back?
Taliesin: I think it has to be soft, right?
Liam: You would have a whole other batch of inspirations in the morning.
Sam: Yeah, but he's got one more shot at this.
Taliesin: I think we have to do it now, right?
Matt: The trance is there. It's up to you.
Taliesin: Give me one more inspiration if you can, and we'll see where we go.
Sam: I will sing one more song to inspire you. I'll sing: (singing) Here's a little song I wrote! It's filled with inspiration note for note. Don't fuck up! Or I'll kill you! (laughter)
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: I don't feel good.
Travis: One at a time.
Taliesin: That'll do. 18, 28, 30.
Matt: 30.
Travis: And we have the inspiration for the third one.
Matt: You managed to complete the scrolling on the trammel. The trammel is still noticeably fragile, but it seems functional. The enchantment will be channeled. So second trammel's done. Final check on the third and final trammel.
Travis: Come on. Jesus.
Marisha: This is so stressful.
Taliesin: That's not bad. Yeah! So that's 34! (cheering)
Taliesin: Rolled a 12 on the inspiration dice.
Matt: With that, the feverish pace of the scrolling as you work across the final trammel, Grog, it's almost to the point where he'll move the chisel to a place, you'll hammer, move back and he's going too fast and he has to go back. And while he's not even looking at you, the chisel will clang multiple times across the side of it, telling you to fucking hit the back of it with the hammer. You take it and slam it, move along, eventually coming across each side of the spiraling trammel to completion. At that point, the hammer still in your grasp, you back away. Percival, you take it and the heated edge of it is burning into your hand a little bit and you walk over and drop it into the trough water. (sizzling) Turn around, drop it next to the third and final piece.
Taliesin: And I faint. (laughter)
Matt: And as Percival hits-- He passes out onto the stairs, half-leaning onto the stairs. You catch him. Grog, you look at your feet where Percival left the last piece and you reach down and pick up the three trammels. They're about that long, each of them, and they're these heavy spikes that come to a gradual spiraling twist at the tip. They're covered in intricate, beautiful scrolling of some sort of arcane language that you are unfamiliar with, and you don't think you've been so proud to be part of crafting anything like this before.
Travis: These are obviously too dangerous for this world, and I walk over to the lava. (laughter)
Travis: Kidding!
Laura: This is a step up from fine leather boots, Grog.
Travis: Yeah, it's true.
Matt: And with the completion of the trammels, this leg of your journey now complete, we're going to close tonight's episode. Good game. (sighs) We'll pick up this at GenCon next week at our live show.
Marisha: So GenCon we're going to start with trying to get out of an active volcano?
Taliesin: Well, I think we'll assume that we're going to take a mansion rest and we'll come out of a mansion rest. Can we assume that's going to be it?
Matt: If you want to take that point now, we'll say with the end of this episode you guys take a mansion rest? No?
Travis: No?
Laura: Or are you tapped out? Do you have any spells left, Scanlan?
Sam: I saved one level eight spell for such a thing.
Laura: So we head into the mansion.
Marisha: And I technically have one 7th-level spell, so if we want to go into the mansion and then I can Plane Shift us home, we can do that. Or wherever we want.
Taliesin: So we can Plane Shift, mansion wherever we need.
Travis: And if we go into the mansion, the first purple servant that hands me a salad, I behead unless it's the GoFiBePo.
Matt: So are you going to long rest and then Plane Shift or Plane Shift and then long rest wherever you land?
Marisha: Plane Shift and then long rest.
Laura: If we're in the mansion, he can't see us. So that's the only thing. It might be good to rest inside the mansion so he can't attack us before we attack him.
Taliesin: Are we going straight to him?
Laura: We don't know.
Taliesin: All right. Mansion.
Marisha: I will be burning my 7th-level spell at the top of the day instead of at the end.
Taliesin: So let's Plane Shift somewhere and mansion.
Marisha: Well, no. I can only Plane Shift us on this plane by basically hacking the spell because the mansion is another plane of existence. So I can't Plane Shift us on this plane. I have to plane to another plane.
Taliesin: We need to rest. Let's rest. Yeah, ignore it.
Marisha: We'll figure it out at GenCon. We'll figure it out in Indianapolis.
Laura: Fuck it, we'll do it live!
Taliesin: We'll do it live!
Travis: We'll do it live!
Matt: All righty, then. So. We'll pick up there next week at GenCon. (exhales) All right, guys.
Travis: That fucking giant sword-swinging bastard! Is he even wearing underpants under that? We don't know.
Laura: No, he's not. I saw his balls. I saw his golden balls.
Liam: It's a big iron pendulum swinging around.
Travis: Legendary action  the nut swing.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Oh goodness gracious, we got to get all of our stuff. Do we need to bring our own binder to GenCon?
Matt: Yes, bring your binders. Bring your sheets. Otherwise, the rest of you, thank you for joining us, as always. Rest well. See you next week, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.
Travis: Beautiful map, Matt. That was amazing. [music]
