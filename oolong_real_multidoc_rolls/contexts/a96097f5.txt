[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone! Welcome to Critical Role tonight! We have some interesting adventurous points to go over. We're also coming off International Tabletop Day, which we had a great time. Met a lot of the wonderful fans, one of which had created their own t-shirt of our group and inspired us to do the same! So you'll see a bunch of us wearing our fantastic, full assortment of Critical Role party member t-shirts tonight. Just for fun. In the meantime, let’s go ahead and get this started, as we all have the chance to warm up with character backgrounds and maybe a little surprise. So be back here in a few minutes, guys! (drumming battle music) (drumming battle music continues)
Ashley: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream. A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! ...also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this... well this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. (weapon crack) Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike, that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. (brawling sounds) Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! ...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for... lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first Impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder crack) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third child of 7 children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men. As they ran, Percy’s sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (sound of a gun cocking and firing)
Sam: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he’s never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it’s rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes. I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Singorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn’t last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (dragon roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough, (ringing weapons SFX) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her. Born of a human mother, and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Singorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear - her own stolen Trinket - to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.
Matt: Welcome back, everyone! The new intro tonight, which I think we're all pretty damn proud of, was put together by our fantastic overlord, Zac. (all cheering)
Matt: It put him to work for quite some time, also the mixing and sound effects done by the amazing Alex Neat and the music you heard was composed by the amazingly talented Jason Charles Miller. So if you don't know Jason you should look him up. He's done stuff for The Guild and many other web shows. Also a fantastic musician on his own with his own stuff. He is the lead singer of Godhead. He's just a good guy. Also a voice actor, look him up if you have any time. Good people, and he lent his talents to our intro so we really appreciate that, buddy. Also we had a great time at Tabletop Day. Got to meet some of our fans. Got to take some pictures. Bunch of cool folks. Some of us got to go on the stream at certain points in the day. All around a good time! So those of you that got a chance to come, thank you so much! And a fan created, as I mentioned before, this awesome t-shirt with the roster, so we were all really inspired to go ahead and make some of our own. Got the party showing off their Critical Role positive.
Marisha: So one of the things we were actually talking about doing, so we'd like to give a shout out to the person who made this, big shout out to @RuzGofDi. Thank you! For doing this. A lot of people have been asking for shirts. I don't know if you guys maybe would be into that or not. So we thought maybe we would wear these, see what you guys thought. But if you guys are into it, we thought about doing a limited run of these and making this the first of our fan-designed t shirts.
Sam: First of many.
Marisha: First of many. Every once in awhile we'll have fans submit designs and then we'll pick a winner. Each one will be a limited run. So if you guys will like this, let us know, and maybe we'll make it happen.
Sam: I'm wearing one right now in my underpants, which we will be selling next week.
Marisha: Yes, and there might be some stills of that to order.
Orion: I'm going to wear mine next game.
Taliesin: Next game.
Matt: I guess some people are into the idea, let the chat know. People seem to be, and we'll be putting more designs out, getting some shirt possibilities to you guys in the near future.
Marisha: Let us know in the chat guys.
Liam: Wait wait wait, I've got some thing. I just gave everyone in the party rupees, treasure!
Marisha: Rupees!
Liam: These were sent to me by Tim West who has a great new company called Fantasy Coin HQ. If you go to fantasycoinhq.com he makes - Matt's holding up a dwarven coin at the moment - they make gems, they make fantasy coins, nerd coins.
Sam: Are we doing free ads now for people?
Liam: This is just a thank you!
Matt: This is a thank you.
Liam: Check it out. Or if you just hit a really tall tuft of grass with a sword, these will pop out of it so you don't have to order them. Just mow your lawn.
Marisha: They’re hefty, too.
Orion: If these were rupees, this is what they would feel like.
Marisha: I kind of want to throw them at people across the room!
Orion: I want to trade them, put them in a pouch.
Matt: Also guys, as a note, we have, available tonight for the person, for people who have managed to get themselves to 2,150 subscribers tonight, we will send out another promo kit to one of you folks in the chat with another signed picture of our Critical Role cast. So be sure to see if we can get the subscribers to climb up as well, so keep an eye out for that in the evening so we can give out one of those before the night is over. That would be awesome.
Sam: Let's do this!
Matt: Let's kick into the game proper, guys! Let's get some proper music playing, because that's what I do.
Orion: That’s what I baby do right.
Sam: (Beatboxing)
Matt: So last we left off, music's not playing here. I need music!
Sam: Doesn't matter.
Matt: The music's important to me! The party had been travelling into the dwarven city of Kraghammer at the behest of arcanist Allura Vysoren in search of a halfling paladin, a very revered folk hero named Lady Kima of Vord who had gone missing following a vision quest somewhere beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer, supposedly for some great evil that was germinating there, festering and growing. After you guys traversed through the dwarven city, you began to find your way down into the mines. The mythril mines of Greyspine beneath the dwarven town. After a few fateful encounters, the return of your gnome cleric.
Ashley: Hey, that's me!
Matt: Grog having his proverbial brains blown out by an intellect devourer. The party then decided to make friends with a mind flayer, an illithid that had been cast out from its people seeking vengeance and possible return to its people. Upon making this alliance, they made an attack on the dwarven, or the duergar, war camp that is threatening to rise up and attack Kraghammer from deep within the mountains themselves. The attack was successful. The general was killed, interrogated, and some interesting information was gleaned from him before his brain was sucked out from his head by Clarota, the mindflayer friend. However, this attack also announced to the local war camp of your presence and in the process of attempting to escape, the druid was damaged and lost her eagle form and thus began a freefall of many party members. A haphazard attempt to use the magic carpet far over its weight limit led most of the party to come crash landing and nearly killing everyone. Managed to escape, walled themselves in thanks to Keyleth’s stone wall spell. And after staying the evening in one of the deeper tunnels, and barely avoiding a roving band of duergar there, you managed to find yourselves in battle with 2 ogres carrying some sort of strange, mutated, black pudding ooze contained in a glass container. The glass container being shattered, of course, by an explosive arrow created by Percy and fired by Vex.
Laura: Go us!
Matt: At the very start of the battle, led into a very rough battle with this strange mutating ooze that kept splitting and splitting, until through some good teamwork, crafty use of telekinesis and a nearby lava pool, and general high damage rolls, you guys managed to survive the encounter.
Travis: Barely.
Matt: Making your way to the bottom of this tunnel, you found yourself looping back around to the large crevice where the giant waterfall had fallen in before, where you had met Clarota. Which allowed you to retrieve your bear Trinket.
Laura: Yeah! Trinket!
Matt: We pick up as you guys begin to step down into the lower tunnels, the ones that are partially coated with a series of magma pools and falls that are trickling out of the rockside. All right everyone.
Sam: I was just so out of it last time. Have we rested? Are we in some need of rest?
Laura: We should probably rest.
Sam: What are we around? What's near us? Is this just a tunnel? Is there any sort of shelter, caves?
Laura: We're by that lake with the giant monster.
Liam: We circled all the way back around.
Sam: Oh shit.
Laura: And went down to that place that you told us not to go in the first place? Yeah, that's where we ended up.
Sam: How was that for you? (all laugh)
Matt: So essentially there was--
Sam: We're back in the camp.
Matt: You're under the camp. You're where the giant chasm leads down into the waterfall. There is a pool of water at the bottom where the aboleth was in the water.
Liam: We just barely survived the chat room and now we need to rest.
Travis: (chuckles) The chatroom. Take it easy on us, all right?
Matt: You guys also just woke up about 2, 3 hours ago.
Laura: Right, so we don't really - oh, we can take hit points.
Matt: You guys can take a short rest and use your hit dice to heal up. You didn't take any damage last game. Thankfully you stayed out of the fray.
Sam: So I'm okay. That's all I need to know.
Matt: You did use one of your Dominate spells.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Only thing of note. So the rest of you who need to heal up can use this time to take a short rest and use your hit dice to heal up on your own.
Travis: I'm ready. Who we fighting next?
Sam: Anyone need some healing? Are we all okay? Are we all good?
Ashley: I think we're all good. Where's everybody at in terms of...
Orion: Well, I'm fine.
Laura: On a personal level, or?
Ashley: You mean like in life, or?
Sam: As we survey the area, how many tunnels we looking at? What's our options here?
Matt: So, (all laugh)
Travis: He's back, he's back.
Orion: Would you calm down?
Matt: Let me pull out this visual aid for you. This is the tunnel sequence you guys have traversed down to the main area where the goblin encampment was. This is the large bridge that went across the giant chasm to where the duergar war camp was. This is the giant drop-off at the waterfall. You guys are currently in this section about to go deeper into this tunnel where a series of small magma trickles are pouring out of the rock.
Sam: So we never went up to the war camp and through it.
Matt: You did.
Sam: Oh we did!
Liam: We crashed down by the tunnel, we fled. We sealed up the way behind us, ran in.
Sam: Got it. So we should keep going? We should just keep going. Magma? Follow the magma.
Liam: Well I recommend. We don't want to go up and through the camp again?
Laura: No no no, we're going into the cavern.
Liam: So we're going to backtrack the way we came to that war camp road, yes?
Laura: No, we're going into the tunnel.
Sam: Did you see the visual aid?
Orion: Yes, we are going into the lava tunnel.
Laura: No no no, in through the tunnel.
Liam: I’ll just follow. I thought I understood.
Matt: (laughs) It’s been a week.
Sam: I mean there might be something to be gleaned from going back to the war camp.
Laura: That tunnel.
Liam: We went out of there.
Laura: No no no no no.
Matt: You guys came through here, you traveled across over the war camp, went back here and tunneled below.
Laura: And popped this out right there. So now we're going into this.
Matt: Correct. Maps.
Liam: And just to make sure that my memory is on point--
Travis: It's not.
Liam: --Before we circled back around, we hit a fork in the road where we could have gone up and we could have gone down.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: So that's behind us.
Laura: That's behind us, we're going down down down.
Liam: Cheers.
Matt: Cheers indeed, huzzah. All right.
Laura: Shall we?
Ashley: We shall!
Sam: Is Clarence with us still?
Matt: Clarota is indeed with you. Clarota took a large black iron duergar bolt to the chest earlier and is mostly recovered but is still even more hunched than usual.
Laura: Does he need healing?
Ashley: He also ate those brains.
Matt: The brains helped him--
Ashley: Helped him a little bit?
Matt: --keep healthy, but he's still a little wounded but he's taking his time to rest up. He seems to be okay. Not as worse for wear as he was before. A slight wheeze that's always to him still present.
Ashley: He's just always a little weezy.
Laura: (meh meh meh sounds)
Liam: (meh meh meh sounds)
Matt: Sounds just like that. So, as you guys begin to push down into this lower chasm, the temperature of the air itself grows steadily warmer and warmer with a drier heat.
Orion: This feels nice.
Matt: You find yourselves, especially those of you with thick armor--
Ashley: Oh, it's so hot!
Matt: --You find that sweat beads begin to trickle down the side of your face--
Ashley: I'm sweating!
Marisha: You're all glisteny!
Matt: --And begin to pool and gather in parts of your chestplate.
Sam: Pike, if you'd like me to hold your armor or do you want me to take it off for a little while?
Ashley: No, I'll keep it on just for safety.
Sam: Let it hang out a little bit?
Liam: Do you even lift, bro?
Sam: Just saying, you might feel more comfortable with a loose fitting sort of cloak?
Laura: Scanlan, stop being creepy!
Sam: I'm not creepy! I'm just trying to be mindful!
Ashley: No, it's fine Scanlan.
Travis: Very considerate of you, a gentleman's offer.
Ashley: Yeah, it’s okay. I'll keep it on.
Sam: I'll just have to use my imagination.
Marisha: A gentleman's offer, yes. That's what we'll call it from now on.
Travis: What permission?
Sam: Onward.
Matt: Pressing further down, the air itself that once had a kind of a hint of that sulfur smell, is now becoming stronger and stronger as you step deeper and deeper into this cavernous tunnel. It rests about 30 feet to 40 feet at width and about 25, 30 feet up and it varies to come pinched tighter or wider at moments, but it continues to be a steady downward climb in a continuous direction. The small trickles, some of them pool and gather into these small, magma cups if you will. Molten hot magma, I knew it was coming.
Orion: (murmurs) I was just wondering if it would happen.
Matt: Ooh, that's minus 200 experience points. (all laugh)
Orion: I feel a bit weaker now.
Matt: You get about 20 or 30 minutes deeper into this tunnel before the sweltering heat gets noticeably warmer and as you crest a slight incline and decline over a small hill portion of this tunnel, you can see now a large portion of the rock has collapsed on the left side and a gargantuan pool of magma is pooling into the tunnel, essentially covering half of the tunnel you are traversing down. It can be walked on the side of safely at about 2 or 3 at shoulder width, but you only have about a 15 foot width here and the rest of it is just extremely bright, hot, molten rock.
Laura: Does it hurt us to get near it?
Matt: No, but it's uncomfortable and something to be very aware of and to watch your step.
Orion: I feel great!
Matt: You feel great.
Liam: I would just like to point out that we're 9 adults playing don't touch the hot lava at the moment. (all laugh)
Sam: Keyleth, you don't have any way of - say it gets hotter than this? You don't have any way of getting some water out here?
Orion: Ooh! I do! And I pull out an empty bottle.
Laura: Oh? Oh?
Liam: Tiberius, I've seen that bottle a lot. What does it do?
Orion: Oh! Um well, uh. I pull out two bottles. This one - they're both empty bottles - but this one is an air bottle and this one is a water bottle.
Liam: Oh! Thank you! That clears that up! (all laugh)
Travis: Even I feel dumber right now. (all laugh)
Sam: Your intelligence is now 4. (all laugh)
Travis: 4...3 and a half.
Liam: Does it make a lot of water?
Orion: Oh! This, if we ever need air--
Sam: I think that's the water one that you just pulled out.
Orion: I take it out (wind SFX). I control a small gust.
Laura: Yes, but what about water? Oh my.
Orion: This, if we need water - And I do a small stream.
Matt: Okay. So a little bit of water just begins to pour perpetually, and without seeming end due to the size of the bottle.
Sam: It's like a piss stream!
Laura: Oh, nice!
Orion: So, if you want to just squirt - and I do a small, little squirt-blasts on Scanlan.
Sam: Ahh!
Laura: Oh, okay. Lovely.
Liam: Is that unlimited?
Orion: Well, of course it is! Why would I carry a non-magical item on me? That's ridiculous.
Ashley: Just a water bottle.
Orion: So yes, Scanlan, we're fine.
Sam: That's good to know.
Laura: So, should we try to cross this little path here?
Ashley: That sounds cool!
Sam: That's really cool.
Laura: Can I use my tracking to see any of those duergar? To see if any of them have passed through the area; if there's a large group of them ahead of us?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: I can use my tracking and my favored terrain to see how many within 6 miles, if there's a large group of them.
Matt: Yes you can. All right. Go ahead and roll for your tracking check on that.
Liam: First roll.
Matt: I believe it's survival.
Laura: Ooh! Here we go!
Travis: Do it for the Star Wars trailer.
Marisha: Roll. Roll. Roll.
Matt: This is with advantage, I believe, because it's your favored terrain, correct?
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: (singing) Your favored terrain!
Laura: Okay, that's better. Is that it?
Liam: Survival.
Laura: 21?
Matt: 21! All right. You take a moment, and about 30 to 40 feet, you go through and inspect the way the terrain's been pushed and the dirt has been shoved aside. Tracking footprints and scuff marks on the rock and the walls nearby, seeing if any of the flows have been interrupted recently, and you ascertain that there is actually a pretty continuous patrol through here. About once every 4 to 8 hours up and down this tunnel that contain anywhere from 5 to 10 or more duergar, sometimes other, larger creatures. You find footprints that resemble maybe the ogres you mentioned earlier, possible troll footprints, but you're not familiar with that entity. You also notice some of the walls have what looks like small, localized cave-ins, almost as if something had burrowed through at one time or another.
Travis: Awesome. Great.
Matt: Large, large creatures. So, there's also things that exist outside of the tunnel system.
Ashley: Like Tremors?
Laura: So, as quickly as possible, we should get through these tunnels, I assume?
Matt: Probably a good idea. As a note though, you said within 6 miles?
Laura: Yes.
Sam: 6 miles?!
Matt: As you continue tracking down this tunnel - and it takes you a good 3 or 4 hours to finally reach a point where the tunnel begins to widen up - you assess that, maybe 3 miles up, there is a localized town. Or, at least, a population of duergar amassed in a central place.
Liam: Check out the brain on Brad!
Laura: So 3 to 4 miles up, you said, from where we are at this point?
Matt: Yeah. From where you began.
Travis: Should we be stealthing?
Laura: We should probably start stealthing at this point, yes.
Liam: Yes. I was about to say I'd like to move ahead of the group a bit and start sneaking along.
Matt: Let's do that! Go ahead and roll stealth.
Liam: Do I have advantage like my sister had for--
Matt: You do not.
Liam: No. All right, well--
Laura: Should we all try to stealth?
Liam: 26 for me.
Matt: This would be a group stealth check.
Liam: 26. I've tiptoed away.
Sam: 19.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: 7.
Travis: 17.
Ashley: 7.
Laura: 20.
Liam: 26.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: (laughs)
Matt: Picking up on the shortcomings of a handful of members of your group, you do manage to maintain what you feel is a fairly stealthy advance deeper into this tunnel system. About an hour and a half of perpetual travel, as the tunnel slowly widens further and further, with every quarter mile or so, you eventually get to a point where the tunnel shoots open into a gargantuan cavern. A chamber nearly a mile and a half across from this visual point.
Ashley: (quietly)...of secrets?
Matt: It is extremely tall, with hundreds of very jagged stalagmites hanging from the ceiling, and rock formations that rise and fall at different points of the topography. This entire tunnel is built in this strange, large, natural, downward curve that disappears out of sight about a mile ahead and to the left. But this huge tunnel is lit with what looks like maybe 2 to 3 dozen various small lava falls that are pouring down the sides of this giant cavern's structure. You also see some small pockets of that red glow stone that a lot of these Dwarven tunnels tend to use as a light source. You also, as you begin to step into this, carefully - you, taking point on this, both the twins; you notice - on the far end of this cavern… Well, first off, the entire landscape is rough and craggy, with large, black, obsidian spikes just jutting out of the ground at various points. Whether it be seismically created or otherwise, it's a very unwelcoming atmosphere. And that sulfurous smell is extremely strong. Even though you’ve gotten used to it as far as you can for this travel, it’s still a very pungent odor and you find that it’s going to be very difficult for you to make out any other scent in this location right now other than that horrible mixture of chemicals that probably isn’t very healthy to be breathing at the moment. What you see across the chamber, your eyes focus on a small cluster of buildings, it looks, of a similar construct as the barracks that you saw at the war camp. You can probably surmise somewhere in the neighborhood of about 20 to 25 of these structures, all localized in this one area that is punctuated with - you can count about 7 of these black obsidian spires that rise out at different points around like watchtowers.
Liam: Still natural?
Matt: No, these are constructed. These are very smooth and have that rigid Dwarvish construction with a jagged edge to each one of the leveled lips of these towers. The one that you can see closest to you, which is about a quarter mile off, you can just barely make out what looks like a couple of duergar walking across one of the upper levels and what looks like some sort of ballista and/or anti-personnel weapon that is put--
Laura: This is where Kima’s being held.
Sam: How do you know that?
Laura: She had a vision.
Orion: Plus, it’s a really big thing.
Sam: That’s true.
Matt: These giant bolt-throwers currently reside on each one of these, and then in the center of this cluster of buildings, you see standing a gargantuan ebony fortress. Serrated stonework marks the top of each wall and more of these giant bolt-throwers are mounted across the parapets. A massive magma fall descends from the rocky ceiling, right above the stronghold, onto the roof and is forked onto each side and then continues to flow down, buttressing each side of the stronghold almost as a defense mechanism, like they built it intentionally underneath this magma fall.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: Oh, that’s where the trapdoor is!
Sam: What? Trapdoor?
Travis: There’s a trapdoor.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Wait...under the magma?
Laura: You missed a lot, Scanlan.
Marisha: Oh, right.
Sam: I was with you the whole time.
Orion: Yes, but you were never paying attention.
Sam: I was drunk.
Orion: You got that new magazine and you’ve been staring at it a long time.
Sam: Well, it’s hot gnomes.
Liam: Vax creeps back to Pike and ushers her up to the front. Do you recall any of the details from your vision, from your dreams?
Ashley: I’ve definitely been here in my vision. (all laugh)
Ashley: I do remember that much. All of this looks familiar, and I think we’re in the right place.
Laura: Sweet.
Orion: Very good. That’s all important.
Ashley: Do we know what else is around? What was the building again? With the--
Sam: It’s a fortress.
Matt: The giant building you see is called Emberhold. That’s what it’s been referred to as.
Sam: And it’s not a temple?
Matt: It’s not a temple, it is a fortress. The temple of where apparently K'Varn as far as you know exists is further below in the fungal forest that surrounds this ancient city ruin that has been repurposed by the illithids that Clarota actually came from.
Laura: Oh, yes! And we know here, because the general that we mind melded - Clarota read his brain.
Sam: Yeah, I was there!
Laura: I know. It’s just you were drunk, so I’m reiterating it. (all laugh)
Sam: Yeah yeah, good, thank you for that.
Orion: Just making sure.
Taliesin: You had this very vivid look the whole time.
Laura: So remember, Scanlan, that the general said that on the left side of the fortress--
Sam: Of the fortress.
Laura: --is how we can get into the trapdoor.
Sam: How we can get into the trapdoor, exactly.
Liam: By the smaller--
Sam: Smaller--
Liam: --of two lava flows.
Laura: By the smaller of two lava flows.
Sam: --of two...what?
Laura: Lava flows.
Ashley: So what we’re looking at is the fortress?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You’re looking at Emberhold itself, the center of the duergar society and from what you’ve gleaned from two different duergar that you’ve interrogated, supposedly where Lady Kima has been held should she still--
Laura: by King Murghol?
Matt: --By King Murghol. Murghol and Queen Ulara.
Liam: From our vantage point can we see the two lava flows that we were warned about?
Matt: It is way too far away. That stronghold is probably a good mile and a half away from you right now.
Laura: So, there is a lot of cover as we go near it because of all the…?
Matt: There is a lot of cover, yes, but it’s a lot of open area with cover, so it’s one of those you’re just going to have to be careful as you move through.
Sam: Percy.
Laura: It’s pretty dark here, right?
Taliesin: Yes?
Sam: How long would it take you to make a nuclear weapon?
Matt: Yes, it’s pretty dark here, the only reason you can see much is because of the low light vision.
Taliesin: A very long time. If I start it right now..
Matt: Even at this radius, things you could see nearby, a light source would be very helpful in making sure that you can see details and not fall in anything you don’t want to, but it also makes you very visible to anything else out there, so you have to decide.
Liam: Between the lava and the red stones, the twins can see, correct? Because of the dim light.
Matt: You can see near, but these are things that are a mile away.
Laura: But nothing at a distance.
Liam: Right, right, right.
Matt: It’s way too far away. The reason you can make out this small city and Emberhold itself is because there are clusters of the red glowstone used within that city and the giant magma fall that currently envelops the sides of the stronghold, making it very, very visible and easy to pick out against the rest of the cavern.
Ashley: So this is a whole little city down here.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: About a mile off, yeah.
Laura: So we should keep to the left and head down that direction and try to--
Marisha: I'm actually gonna go ahead and cast Pass Without A Trace.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: (whispering) What does that do?
Marisha: (whispering) It makes us really stealthy.
Sam: Oh, cool!
Orion: It's the thing that saved our butts last time.
Liam: It quiets your parts.
Matt: You've seen this before. As she finishes her incantation, you feel the darkness of the shadows around you begin to coalesce and almost stick to you. Although there's no substance, for a moment you almost find yourself repulsed by it, until you realize that it's probably an advantageous circumstance. But you find yourself now much easier to slip into the surrounding shadows.
Marisha: They're nice shadows.
Travis: And I'm doing my flower girl routine with the dust of tracelessness. Just over here, over there, put a little on Pike.
Taliesin: We don't really need - Well...
Travis: What? We've got a really large amount.
Orion: You never know, Percy, he does it all the time. We don't know how many times it's saved us.
Marisha: (laughing) We've got a really large amount.
Taliesin: I suppose that's fair.
Sam: What's our angle here, gents?
Liam: We need to get closer up. We need to find this trap door, because it's suicide going in the front.
Laura: Right. And Lady Kima's being held here.
Sam: So there's an entrance to this trap door that possibly is on the outskirts of the city?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: So we need to find it.
Laura: Yes, it's on the left.
Sam: Oh, it's on the left?
Laura: Yes, so we're heading left and going--
Sam: Let's do it!
Liam: The twins will creep - continue ahead.
Ashley: Yeah, you guys real stealthy, so--
Travis: Yeah, keep creeping, keep creeping.
Ashley: --Probably smart that you're moving ahead.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: I'll take point on the group that's following.
Matt: All right.
Laura: You guys take care of Trinket as I'm ahead of you.
Ashley: Come on, Trinket.
Travis: (growling sounds) Me and Trinket are telling jokes in the back of the group.
Sam: Quietly.
Marisha: Classic Trinket.
Matt: All right. You guys continue staying off the main path and you can see there is about a 20-foot natural formation of a walkway or at least where most of the patrols and any sort of duergar foot travel is localized. You can see where that natural road has been created over time. You avoid that path and steer off to the left, dodging between the various bits of terrain. And it's a very rocky and difficult terrain should you not be with your ranger, who has the Underdark as her favored terrain.
Laura: Oh, I'll go back, then. Should I? Or is it okay because we're all together?
Matt: It's okay because you guys are in theory together. I'm going to say essentially you're just marking places where the terrain would be dangerous, to watch your step and to be wary of any locations that might be unsafe for load bearing, anything like that.
Travis: Yeah, I saw that look. You calling me load bearing? (all laugh)
Matt: Yes!
Travis: That's honest.
Matt: Specific. As you guys begin to curve around the left, everyone roll a perception check real fast.
Sam: Oh, snap.
Travis: Prepare for a natural... lap.
Orion: With our proficiency bonus?
Matt: Only if you're proficient with perception.
Sam: I can't read the dice. It's either a 6 or a 9. No idea.
Orion: 15.
Matt: Is there a dot on the bottom?
Sam: Oh, that's the bottom?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: It's a 6! (all laugh)
Ashley: Oh, Scanlan!
Marisha: 16.
Orion: 15.
Taliesin: 24.
Travis: 9.
Ashley: 19.
Laura: 20.
Liam: 25.
Matt: All right. Both Percy and Vax simultaneously put their arms out to hold everyone back as you instinctively--
Liam: Dtdtdt!
Matt: --You hear a slight distant clanking of metal and voices. Low, kind of conversational voices. Too far for you to listen at this point. But you guys immediately stop everyone. And you can just see, over maybe a good 70, 80 feet from your distance, heading up the path you guys had just began to skirt around, a small, what looks like a roving patrol of duergar. Probably the ones that go up and down the tunnel.
Laura: I can ambush them!
Sam: Ambush them?
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Taliesin: (whispering) Let them pass.
Sam: Why don't we create a distraction and get rid of them?
Laura: Well, okay, but I can - (whispering) I can be really quiet. I can do Hide In Plain Sight now. So, I could completely hide myself standing there.
Sam: How many are there? Are you gonna kill--
Matt: No one's seen them, you can just hear them. No one's gone to check.
Laura: Oh! Can I look?
Liam: Yes, let's go look.
Matt: You can.
Laura: Okay, let's look.
Liam: Let's go catch one.
Marisha: (quietly) Can we not just hide?
Matt: Just the two of you?
Orion: How far away are we from them? Like, in distance?
Matt: Right now? You're guessing about 80 to 70 feet, but closing fast. Not closing directly on you, because they're doing a slightly different path.
Laura: (whispering) Everybody stay quiet.
Taliesin: They're taking the path that we're not on, right?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: So, if we hide--
Laura: They won't find us.
Taliesin: --They won't find us.
Laura: Potentially.
Orion: And they can just pass.
Laura: But I want to hear what they're saying.
Matt: Okay, so all of you guys, who's--
Marisha: We'll all hide. I go ahead and cast Guidance on Vax.
Laura: What does that mean?
Liam: Vex.
Matt: Is that a concentration spell?
Laura: I'm Vex, he's Vax. We look alike, it's understandable.
Matt: Just checking if it’s concentration or not, because that will definitely break your other spell. I'll pull it up here real fast.
Laura: Oh, no, then don't. Keep Pass Without A Trace.
Travis: Well, we could just get this party started right here, if we want to.
Marisha: Let me see, it might just be--
Matt: Guidance is concentration.
Marisha: No, sorry, you don't have my guidance.
Laura: That's okay, that’s okay.
Marisha: No guidance here.
Liam: Why don't we go just up ahead and scout?
Laura: Just a little bit ahead and see what we can see.
Matt: Okay. So, the two of you kind of work up. As the rest of you are holding back, the twins slink between the various rock formations and strange, jagged spires that are currently peppering this entire underground landscape. You get up to a point where you're maybe 10 feet from the road and with your backs against the rock, you can begin to see the roving band slowly move around.
Sam: (whispering) Band?
Matt: The band of duergar. You count, at quick glance, roughly 12 to 15.
Marisha: Oh, yeah...
Matt: Armed with hammers, halberds, um... Both of you guys roll a perception check right now.
Liam: Perception check.
Matt: Perception check. Specific for this one.
Liam: 26.
Laura: 17.
Matt: You make out that one of them holds no weapons. Instead is dressed in--
Laura: Wait, no! I get advantage on perception, because I'm in my favored terrain.
Matt: There you go.
Liam: I already perceived it.
Laura: Oh, yeah, never mind, okay. (all laugh)
Matt: You can also perceive, I suppose.
Orion: (whispering) I already perceived it.
Matt: One of the duergar walking alongside is completely bald on top with this extremely long, well sculpted, black goatee beard that streams down. Thick black and red trimmed robes. Carries no weapons and looks extremely dangerous. However, as you're listening to the conversation, you specifically, being able to understand Undercommon--
Laura: Yes.
Liam: What is he saying?
Laura: Hold on.
Matt: --You pick up bits and pieces as they begin to pass by. You hold your breath, hoping nobody notices you, and so far so good. They begin to walk slowly past the rock you guys are against. You overhear one of them say: "Well, keep your eyes peeled, eh. That thing is still out there." And the other one slaps him and says: "Horek says that it ate a whole scouting party in seconds." Another one goes: "Listening to Horek was your first mistake. Shut up and keep walking." And they all keep pushing. At which point, the same scared one from before says: "I mean, if that one went crazy, well, can't the other ones crack, too? I don't know if I feel safe around any of K'varn's pets anymore at this rate." And by that point, they begin to slowly move past and their voices begin to fade, as they continue up the path you guys just traversed down.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Up to the lava tunnels.
Laura: Oh shit.
Travis: Good thing I was clearing our footprints. (all laugh)
Matt: It's actually a very good thing.
Sam: It's a win for Grog.
Travis: (high-pitched voice) Is it? Did I do something good?
Liam: Good job, dummy.
Marisha: (laughing) Did I do something good?
Matt: You guys have, like, bear tracks and a giant goliath, like, what-- (laughs)
Orion: These are amazing.
Marisha: What are they?
Laura: Fried banana.
Marisha: Oh! That's fun.
Matt: Fried bananas? Toss me one of those. Is that from the chat?
Sam: You're working. You don't have time to eat.
Zac: (off screen) Yes, the chat room.
Matt: Thank you, chatroom.
Laura: Thank you, chatroom.
Marisha: Thank you.
Orion: Thanks so much.
Matt: I know it's not a piece of pizza, guys, but I'll do what I can. (all laugh)
Sam: Next time, sushi. Sushi.
Zac: (off screen) Instajur and somebody who didn't put their name on it.
Matt: (disappointed) Oh.
Orion: Instajur and mystery guy, thanks!
Zac: Coleson sent the pizza.
All: Thank you!
Ashley: Oh my god, that's so good.
Matt: The sound of the duergar walking eventually fades and you feel pretty confident that you're safe to return to the rest of the party.
Laura: Okay. So, we walk back. So, apparently, number one, big party, we don't want to fight them if we don't have to. Secondly, there's some weirdo creature that's gotten loose and is very, very bad and it's killed multiple duergar already.
Liam: Quickly.
Laura: That might be the thing--
Sam: No indication of what kind of a creature it was?
Laura: No, but it might be the thing we already killed. It could've been the thing with the plate that showed up in the camp, I don't know.
Sam: The thing with the plate?
Ashley: The thing in the red rider wagon.
Travis: The bullet, the bullet.
Laura: The big thing.
Travis: Bulette.
Marisha: Bulé.
Sam: Oh!
Laura: It could've been that, I'm not sure.
Travis: It's a French dog.
Marisha: It’s French, yeah.
Laura: Regardless, we should be very careful, traveling forward.
Taliesin: I've seen your sheet, you don't speak French.
Sam: We could use that to our advantage.
Orion: We could! We could. We could scare them off quite easily.
Marisha: I had a grandmother who did, okay?
Laura: I like the way you think. All right.
Orion: I can make funny sounds.
Laura: Should we keep moving forward at a very stealthy sort of pace?
Orion: Waka waka.
Matt: Certainly.
Taliesin: The stealthy mix.
Matt: You guys push forward, keeping that wide, kind of left curve, which adds a fair amount of time to your travel, as you're being careful and moving at a very very heavy, circular arc around the duergar city.
Sam: I'm looking for doors and stuff as we go. I don't know why.
Matt: Sure! Looking for doors!
Sam: Well, there's a trap door somewhere, right?
Orion: (old man voice) There’s doors in them there caves.
Matt: Good thinking.
Liam: That'll be the fortress, maybe, but--
Laura: Possibly. Could be farther. Can we see the molten things that he was talking about? The lava flows?
Matt: Still too far away.
Laura: Still too far away.
Matt: As you begin to make your way around, you're just starting to get to the point where you can see the front of the fortress. And you can see where the magma fall splits and just coalesces around each side of the stronghold. Almost like a blanket waterfall on each side. It does split up at certain points, you can begin to start making it out.
Taliesin: Where does the magma runoff lead to? Does it just pour out? Does it fill a moat?
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance, unfortunately. You'd have to get closer up to see. About an hour of travel around the side--
Laura: Oh wow.
Liam: I’m so bored.
Laura: (laughs) Don't say that.
Matt: (laughs) That can be fixed, Liam. (all laugh)
Taliesin: If only there were a way to just speed up this exposition somehow.
Travis: Of all the things.
Matt: Indeed.
Taliesin: Life isn't like that.
Orion: Wow, Percy!
Taliesin: Sorry. (all laugh)
Laura: (whispering) Be quiet.
Matt: It's at this point, immediately catching your eye, Vex, one of the nearby obsidian spires is a different color than the rest. The rest are like a deep black, glass shiny color. This one is a dull crimson.
Laura: Ooh! We should go towards that one.
Sam: Because it's a different color?
Liam: Let's go check it out.
Marisha: Wait, what was the first color? I was still laughing at Percy. What?
Liam: Just eat your banana, the twins will go check it out.
Matt: Black obsidian, this was red--
Marisha: (laughing) Red, okay.
Matt: --crimson, ruddy, anyway.
Taliesin: Do you not know anything?
Liam: The twins are gonna go have a peek.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'm coming with.
Matt: Scanlan comes with. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Sam: Oh boy. (laughs)
Taliesin: I'm not coming with.
Sam: Not my strong suit.
Travis: Don't fuck it up.
Laura: No, Scanlan, what did you do?
Liam: You dick!
Travis: Did you?
Marisha: What did you do? (all laugh)
Orion: You can change your mind.
Ashley: Wait, wait, I go and--
Sam: I've got advantage, don't I?
Ashley: --I grab Scanlan and I kiss him on the cheek and make him stay. (all gasp and exclaim)
Orion: What?!
Taliesin: Way to take one for the team.
Orion: Oh no.
Travis: I don't know.
Liam: You just stopped him from farting into his flute.
Ashley: Persuasion? That would be...
Orion: Ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge moment.
Marisha: Can you roll a persuasion against a critical fail? Can you? Can you persuade a crit fail?
Laura: Can you persuade the DM?
Ashley: Wait, is it a fail?
Marisha: (laughing) Can you persuade the DM?
Ashley: It is a 1?
Matt: Okay, so it was a 1--
Sam: It was a 1.
Liam: That's a 1 face. (all laugh)
Liam: That's a 1 face.
Matt: I will say, Pike, roll a perception check.
Orion: d20!
Laura: Come on, come on, d20.
Ashley: Perception?
Liam: Yes, d20. Uh, that's a half a d20.
Ashley: 14?
Laura: (soft, high voice) No, no... yes, 14. (all laugh)
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: I'll stop.
Matt: Unfortunately, you're not quite perceptive enough to notice Scanlan's not quite so quiet walking away, as you're distracted by the surroundings and the circumstance locally. You continue up with the twins, absentmindedly humming to yourself.
Sam: (sings softly)
Matt: The twins, being used to your humming, for some reason it doesn't connect. You make your way up to the spire. At about 15, 20 feet out, you notice the coloration is different, because it is completely coated in what looks like dried blood of some kind.
Liam: Fuck.
Laura: (gasps) Oh god.
Matt: And immediately to the right of it, along the ground--
Orion: So grossed out.
Matt: --currently your vision is obscured by another, large kind of twisted stalactite, but there appears to be an arm and a whole bunch more dried blood across the ground, just out of view.
Laura: (gasps) Stop! Can we stop? Can we stop?
Matt: You can stop.
Marisha: An arm?
Laura: Scanlan. Shh.
Sam: What? What?
Laura: (whispering) You're singing.
Sam: I was singing? (whispering) I was singing? I didn't even know! It's a force of habit!
Liam: I'm going to see if I can see anything in the area that has done this recently.
Laura: Is the arm attached to whatever did--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: Investigation check?
Laura: --Is the arm part of a dead thing or is it alive?
Matt: It's on the ground.
Travis: I'm pretty sure whatever it is, it's dead.
Liam: 7.
Matt: 7?
Laura: Can I check it out as well? I mean, I'm there, I might as well.
Matt: You can also attempt to make an investigation check.
Liam: Clever. There you go.
Laura: Wait, I'm doing advantage, too, just in case. Okay, that one's better.
Liam: Oh, I can get advantage?
Sam: You get advantage on investigation?
Laura: No, I got it because I'm fucking in my favored terrain. (all laugh)
Laura: 21.
Marisha: You walk up in this terrain.
Matt: The state of the blood that you see around seems to indicate that this has transpired over some time. You're guessing probably within a few days, if not a week, since this happened.
Liam: I'm picking up one of the arms--
Laura: (Gasps)
Liam: --to bring back to the group.
Matt: Okay, so as you walk up towards the arm to grab it, you have more of a view of what's happened. And what you see before you are definitely remnants of some battle long past.
Laura: This is the skelly pile.
Matt: Against these rocky formations there's dried blood everywhere.
Liam: Not pretty.
Matt: This terrible bloodbath, whatever this event was, it was probably a horrible thing to see. There are pieces of duergar flung about. And I say pieces - the only reason you know duergar were there is because occasionally you see part of a head, or part of a foot. And you recognize the ashy skin from the areas that aren't currently caked with its own gore.
Liam: (gagging sounds)
Matt: From what you can tell, because of your investigation check, the remains are torn apart by no blade. There's no cuts, there's no clean wounds. They're either pulled apart by force--
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: --like, arms and limbs were wrenched from the body just out of sheer power.
Travis: Like a Wookiee.
Matt: Or there appears to be some sort of gnawing, some chewing, like toothy fangs, sharp teeth have partially eaten portions of these bodies.
Liam: This is the work of a beaver.
Laura: Yes, definitely, a very large beaver.
Orion: A busy beaver.
Sam: I think it's suicide. (all laugh)
Laura: Based on tracking and everything and insight, can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby? Or if it's gone?
Orion: I think it might be foul play, actually.
Matt: From what you can tell--
Liam: It happened in the past.
Matt: --Yeah, it happened quite some time ago. Looking at the tracks, you can see duergar feet, you can see other creatures that resemble those hook horrors that you encountered earlier during the lava pool. However, there's a series of tracks that you haven't seen. Well, there is very erratic footsteps that look human size, but they seem to be placed randomly, like one foot here, one foot here, one foot here.
Laura: (gasps) It's that big creature that - it was like one of those things that that thing put together, like--
Matt: And you see what seem like strange strikes through the sand, like someone had been dragged very quickly in a very localized spot, scattered all about.
Liam: It's a human centipede.
Sam: It is. It's a human centipede.
Matt: It's a very strange pattern that you can't really grasp what kind of creature would make it.
Laura: And it seems like it was here recently, or a while ago?
Matt: Best you can tell, the last time it was here was about two or three days ago, to feast on more of the remains.
Liam: Human? Human footprints?
Laura: Should we get out of here?
Matt: Human sized.
Liam: Human sized.
Travis: Or set a trap.
Laura: We could try to set a trap, or we could look and see if we can loot anything? Is there anything to loot? Does it look like anything shiny?
Matt: Any semblance of armor that belonged to any of these individuals is in such tatters that it's unusable. You do manage to find, across some of the body parts, a couple of blood-soaked gold coin purses.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Take it.
Laura: I like gold.
Matt: One of them contains a handful of gems.
Laura: Ooh!
Marisha: Gems.
Matt: Yes, those right there. So you can mark that down, until you get a chance to appraise them.
Liam: I don't think we want to tangle with this. What are we trying to prove? Let's just keep trucking.
Sam: I'm really bad at stealthing, we should go. (all laugh)
Sam: We should leave.
Liam: Also, put the accordion back in the bag, all right?
Sam: Was I doing that? It's force of habit, I don't - it's like breathing.
Liam: Yeah, we're going to go back to the group, I'm going to bring the arm.
Travis: I take out the cask of ale and pour a little tankard of ale, just because I'm bored.
Ashley: Have a sip sip.
Matt: Good man. Well done. It's very tasty.
Travis: Would anyone else like a sip? Keyleth?
Matt: Having been underground for what probably amounts now to four or five days, that little taste of ale on your lips is a very welcoming and very refreshing sensation.
Travis: It's good shit, right?
Ashley: Oh, delicious. Oh no, I'm drunk! Just kidding. (all laugh)
Ashley: That was fast! Just kidding.
Liam: When we get back to the group, I'm going to toss the arm to Grog.
Matt: Grog, you instinctively reach up and catch it. You look down and see what looks like a duergar arm that has been very heavily mangled.
Travis: Oh! Thanks for the hand! (all laugh)
Liam: It's a back scratcher.
Orion: That was clever, Grog!
Laura: Well, we killed a lot of duergar this time.
Travis: Don't negative anything. It was a good joke. (all laugh)
Matt: It was a good joke. I considered it, but no.
Travis: Have mercy!
Orion: That was a good joke.
Laura: There's a big centipede-y human, creepy creature that's killed a lot of things and we should probably avoid that at all costs.
Orion: I would agree with that.
Liam: If we have to, we will, but--
Taliesin: That seems fair.
Laura: Can we avoid that and still head left of the keep?
Matt: You haven't seen a creature.
Sam: Wait, we didn't make it into the - was there a structure that we could have entered?
Laura: That's where we're going.
Liam: You're heading towards that structure.
Matt: You're heading towards that structure.
Sam: Okay. But I mean, where we just were?
Orion: The magma fortress.
Matt: Where you just were? No, there's just all these giant rocky spires jutting out of the ground.
Liam: Spike coated in dried blood.
Sam: They didn't have doors in them?
Laura: Should we probably have looked for like a nest?
Matt: There were no doors.
Sam: Okay, good. I'm looking for a door!
Liam: No, we should just keep going. If we're going to run into it, we're going to run into it. Let's not find it.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: It appears like there was, at one point in time, some very intense seismic activity in this area that created this cavern, and whatever is the source of a lot of this perpetually flowing, molten rock. That's why the entire terrain here is so dangerous and uninviting, is because of the sheer force that went into its creation.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: So we should just keep freaking being careful and keep going towards the giant thing.
Sam: Okay. Let's go.
Ashley: Keep trucking on.
Sam: Pike, I have this weird feeling, like you wanted to make out with me. Is that something that happened? Am I dreaming?
Ashley: Well, you just, you know, you weren't paying attention.
Sam: Really?
Laura: And that makes you want to make out with him?
Ashley: No, I think you were moving along to try to go stealth and sometimes you should just stay put and see what happens. (all laugh)
Orion: Well said, cleric!
Liam: That was the most adorable diss in history. (all laugh)
Taliesin: That was cold.
Sam: All right.
Orion: Yet inviting.
Travis: It's all right, Scanlan. We'll go pay for it later. (all laugh)
Matt: A small hit to Scanlan's morale, but the party marches on.
Liam: You lose an inspiration die. (all laugh)
Travis: Disadvantage on whatever roll.
Sam: I deserved it, I deserved it.
Liam: Okay, twins in front, here we go.
Laura: Let's keep going.
Matt: Twins in front. You guys continue to push forward. For the sake of the length of this journey, I'm going to have the party go ahead and roll a communal stealth check once more.
Marisha: I still have Pass Without A Trace up.
Taliesin: Oh, for the love of god.
Marisha: Which gives everyone a plus 10.
Laura: Oh, really?!
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Percy! Don't bang the guns together.
Taliesin: Yeah, that happened too.
Orion: 24.
Matt: 24?
Sam: 19.
Liam: We all have plus 10?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: And this is plus 10, already?
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: I rolled a 1.
Matt: Okay. (all groan)
Laura: Oh, Percy!
Sam: I kiss Percy! (all laugh)
Taliesin: What?! Ah!
Sam: I don’t know! I thought it might help.
Orion: You have to use the tongue, Scanlan.
Marisha: 23.
Sam: Is that bubblegum?
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Travis: 26.
Ashley: 3.
Taliesin: I have a habit.
Laura: (gasps) You have a plus 10.
Ashley: Oh! I get to do plus 10 bonus to that?
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: 13!
Matt: All right, so that's three failures.
Laura: 30.
Marisha: Three failures?
Liam: 32.
Matt: Okay, good.
Taliesin: (relieved) Ah!
Matt: More than half you guys succeeded. That bit is key. A one is two failures.
Laura: Oh no!
Ashley: I'm not stealthy, man.
Marisha: A one is two failures?
Matt: A one is considered two failures for this challenge. Pushing forward--
Taliesin: Now you roll well.
Matt: --you manage to stop Percy and find out the root of this audio problem. Pushing forward, you manage to make your way about a quarter mile on the outskirts of this cluster of buildings. Curving far left, you're just managing to keep out of the city proper and move straight towards the very back wall of this cavern, which is buttressed against - what this fortress is built against. So you're circumventing the city to go straight to this fortress. As you're moving, about a quarter mile from the stronghold, Vex, you pick up a strange person standing maybe about 50, 60 feet ahead of you.
Laura: Just a person?
Matt: Just a person, it looks like.
Laura: (worried laughter)
Orion: (worried laughter)
Laura: Can they see us? Does it look like they can see us?
Matt: You take a moment, keeping an eye out, and the person isn't moving. Just standing right there.
Laura: (whispering) So. There's a person standing right there.
Marisha: (whispering) What?
Laura: (whispering) A person. He's just standing there.
Matt: It's too dark to make out any details, unfortunately.
Laura: No. Hmm.
Sam: Could be good, could be bad. We have no idea.
Liam: Can I see him now that she's pointed him out to me?
Sam: I can hold him. Might piss him off.
Travis: At least do the hold.
Matt: You can see it. And there is a humanoid, standing on its own.
Liam: It doesn't seem to be moving, though.
Laura: Maybe it's a scarecrow?
Liam: Maybe it's a statue.
Laura: Yeah, that's what I mean.
Travis: A statue?
Sam: Want me to go check it out?
Liam: No! I don’t!
Laura: Can't you go invisible?
Sam: Yes, I can go invisible.
Laura: Go invisible and check it out.
Sam: I polymorph and turn into a fly and I buzz over.
Marisha: Oh, yay! That's fun.
Liam: Good job, gnome nuts.
Laura: Oh no, if he's magic, he's going to know.
Sam: It's all right. I've got magic, too.
Matt: You approach this individual and notice it is unmoving and is of a singular, solid color.
Laura: (whispering) It's a statue.
Matt: What looks to be what is an illithid or a mind flayer is currently locked in some sort of reactionary position, but is completely turned to stone.
Laura: Oh no!
Marisha: Oh shit.
Sam: Like a Medusa type of a thing?
Liam: We faced basilisks once and they did this to Vex'ahlia.
Travis: We've got basilisk eggs.
Marisha: There's a lot of things that can do this, actually, to be fair.
Laura: We do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding.
Travis: Yeah, we’ve got eight of them. Maybe we should crack one on statue guy.
Sam: I buzz back to the group. (buzzing)
Laura: Oh, what's that? Oh, it's Scanlan.
Sam: I kind of fuck with Tiberius's ear a little bit. (all laugh)
Orion: Oh, Scanlan, stop it!
Sam: And I turn back. (all laugh)
Travis: Well, what did you see?
Laura: What was it?
Sam: A crazy statue of a crazy illithid.
Liam: That's crazy.
Laura: Can we look at Clarota and say "Do you know anything about this?"
Matt: Clarota kind of thinks for a second and goes (breathy, raspy voice) "As far as I've noticed, occasionally these patrols do walk with a lizard creature that has this ability. It's generally used as a threatening device or a guardian amongst the city."
Marisha: Oh! So the duergar--
Laura: Have basilisks.
Marisha: --have this as, like, their pets?
Matt: "A trained beast, yes."
Liam: Why do you suppose they used it on one of their own?
Matt: "I can only imagine maybe this transpired before the union and is left as a warning."
Liam: So it's a duergar pet?
Laura: Do we remember how to take care of basilisks? Like, do we not look at them, is that how they don't--
Liam: Don't look at them. That's correct.
Laura: Don't look them in the eye? Or don't look at their face?
Liam: Yes, that's it. It's a vision thing.
Laura: Yes?
Taliesin: Yes, I believe it's vision based.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: This would be a nature check.
Taliesin: Double check.
Matt: For anyone who wishes to make one.
Marisha: I'll do that.
Travis: Me too. (all laugh)
Taliesin: 23. Natural 20.
Laura: Oh, well, never mind. He's got it.
Orion: Very good, yay!
Marisha: Oh, well, I'll stop there.
Travis: Just go ahead and dunk on everybody, why don't you?
Matt: Natural 20. Essentially it is a sight-based circumstance.
Taliesin: It's entirely visual. They have to catch your gaze and then that is how they can turn you into stone. Otherwise, as long as you don't catch their gaze, you'll be fine.
Laura: All right.
Liam: All right. It's a good thing we've all been watching Daredevil last week.
Travis: So, look them in the eye? Got it. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Yes! Very helpful.
Travis: Let's go.
Marisha: Poor basilisks. Can never make eye contact.
Sam: We're going on?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Yeah, let's keep going.
Matt: As you guys push forward, Clarota lags behind a little bit to inspect the statue. Kind of looks it over for a second--
Laura: Did you know him?
Matt: (low, breathy voice) "Uh…"
Sam: Dave.
Matt: (laughing) Goddamn it! (all laugh)
Orion: I don't think his name was Dave, Scanlan.
Matt: He takes a moment to look over and you can see his eyes close slightly for a second. (raspy, breathy voice) "Aye, we've met. Not the kindest of my people, but, nevertheless, should all this pass, I would like to, maybe, release him from this stony prison."
Laura: So you know how to do that?
Matt: "I know not, but it can be done. I've seen it."
Laura: Didn't we do that?
Orion: Yes.
Laura: Didn't we have to do that?
Liam: We sprinkled some of its blood on your eyes, if I remember correctly.
Orion: Yes!
Laura: I turned to stone?
Matt: You did.
Liam: You did. I was very sad.
Orion: Yes, that's correct. We used the blood of the creature.
Laura: I remember, I remember. Yeah, I remember that.
Matt: Essentially, there is a liquid that can be distilled from the basilisk blood.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: We don't have any more of that.
Matt: You do not.
Laura: Okay. So we'll be careful.
Travis: Dragon blood for fucking days.
Liam: We also don't know if it's a basilisk.
Sam: Should we move this statue off to a safe place, inside or anything?
Laura: Nah, fuck it.
Sam: It's fine here, it's fine.
Liam: No, it's heavy.
Laura: Let's just keep going.
Marisha: It's been there for a while.
Taliesin: Let's not give anybody any indication we've been here.
Laura: It's got bat poo on it, let's keep going.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: As you guys press forward, about another 20 or so minutes, you now have a much better view of the left side of Emberhold proper. And you can see the large magma fall that is pouring over the top of the fortress's second story and completely encompasses that side. It splits and divides towards the center - a larger fall towards the front of the fortress and a thinner one towards the very back.
Laura: (whispering) Thin one! Thin one!
Travis: Yeah, let's go towards the door.
Liam: All right, creeping back.
Laura: Yeah! Creepy, creepy, creepy towards the thin one.
Liam: The creeps are creeping.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: We're in stealth, still, or...?
Travis: Yeah, we're all stealthed.
Matt: For you, it'd be stealth. Yeah, you guys are all stealthed still.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: We're rolling again?
Liam: 26.
Laura: You don't to need check it again, he didn't tell us to.
Liam: Oh. Well, I said I wanted to go back and look.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: So you move ahead of the rest of the group and head to the front of this stream. And you can see the smooth wall with molten rock pouring down the side, and you can see where portions of the stone have been gradually worn and melted by just the contact, but then built upon by more and more cooled rock. This is a very weird clustered framing of cooled rock around this fall. You see no doorway, as the actual magma is pressing directly against the side of the stronghold.
Liam: Right, I want to see if I can tell if anything - I know this all looks natural, but perhaps something is fashioned to look such. I want to see if I can figure that out.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigate check.
Liam: Uh, lalalala. 18.
Matt: 18? Best that you can find, looking around, you cannot see anything before you, any sort of mechanism, any sort of any button, any sort of lever, or additional doorway. It's just a solid wall, with the two magma flows.
Liam: All right. I double back for the Underdark expert and I bring my sister up.
Laura: Right, right, right. Can I come up and look and see if I can see any tracking? If there's any footprints around a certain area around this.
Liam: See if you can find a false door or something.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make an investigate check.
Liam: Do it. Do it.
Marisha: Wait, I thought it was behind--
Liam: No!
Laura: It's okay, no, no, no! I get an advantage.
Liam: It was a 1.
Laura: Shush.
Liam: All right. That's not a 1.
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: Is it investigation?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: 22.
Matt: Okay. Looking at this, the side of this fortress, you can see what amounts to a very, very slight raise in the smooth flow of magma. It seems to pour down most of the stronghold and then slightly bulge out, and then it pools, and you can now have a better, closer so you see where it runs off to. It continues into a stream following the edge of the giant cavern wall that's curving down and to the left into a far deeper cavern. You can see the entire cavern, almost like a giant U. It's open, and the entire thing banks around it and goes deeper still. You guys have made it to the far back wall.
Laura: (gasps, sighs)
Matt: Ah, the chicken has arrived.
Sam: (laughs) Metaphorically...
Matt: Metaphorically, and actually. But from what you can see there is a slight raise beneath the magma.
Laura: Okay. Does it look like it's safe to bring everybody up here or does it seem like anything's around that could see us? Anything looking from above?
Matt: You glance up and you can see there are two duergar perched up on the edge of the first floor, right on the parapet. You can see there's all this jagged, obsidian stone, almost teeth, sticking out of the very top edge of the wall. And you see the patrols just walking, keeping an eye out. They have crossbows on their arms. A couple of others just have javelins at the side. And they're just doing slow patrols.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: We need to 007--
Laura: We're going to have to be super--
Sam: We're going to have to 007 sniper them out.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I can handle this, I think.
Laura: You can?
Marisha: I think I can get us into that trap door.
Sam: I think you're right.
Laura: Do you have something that can pull it towards you?
Sam: No no no, can you redirect the magma flow around that bulge with your - can't you, move rocks or--
Marisha: I can.
Sam: So you can create a like a little lip for it to go around?
Laura: Ooh...
Marisha: I was thinking I could either do - that's not a bad idea, or I could - That's actually not a bad idea. (all laugh)
Matt: (singing) That's fucking teamwork. (all laugh)
Marisha: Or I could, or I was thinking I could cool off the magma and we could break it.
Laura: Oh yeah, maybe you can move it away, and then cool it.
Liam: That sounds kind of noisy.
Marisha: Well...
Sam: First we’ve got to take care of the guys on the roof. Are they back with us, or are they still stealthing in front?
Matt: They're still stealthing in front, and you guys have come back to the group?
Laura: Yeah, I guess we came back to the group and told them about what's going on.
Sam: Okay. We can - me and Pike - can take out the guys on the roof.
Laura: Oh really?
Travis: Yeah! Do it!
Ashley: You want to give it a go?
Laura: Wait, but he's got sneak attack.
Liam: Yeah, I'm thinking that Keyleth should--
Laura: Yeah but we could--
Sam: Yeah, but they're a good 200 feet up.
Liam: --bird out and drop me.
Laura: If Keyleth can bird up or you could go over on the flying carpet or something.
Sam: I can take Pike and we can do it.
Laura: Oh my god. (all laugh)
Marisha: Are they are they unable to be shot out? Can you not arrow them out?
Laura: I can try to arrow them out too.
Marisha: How high are they?
Liam: She can get a hit or two, but the chances that she could take them both out at once...
Laura: Maybe you should go up and I'll arrow one and you...
Travis: Why don't you let the little people have some fun?
Marisha: I'm just afraid if you go up there, that you're going to alarm yourself to other people.
Taliesin: How loud is it down there? Is the lava flow making noise?
Matt: Very subtle pops and hisses, but other than that it's pretty quiet.
Taliesin: Not like the roaring sound of a waterfall.
Matt: No, no, it's a slow gradual pour.
Taliesin: Does anybody have a "mute" spell of some kind?
Sam: Mute, as in silence noise, or a person?
Laura: I mean, Pass Without Trace, there's silence?
Taliesin: Yes, as in silence noise.
Ashley: Wait!
Sam: No, not me.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Ashley: I have - okay wait.
Matt: David Norris? Thank you David Norris for the chicken!
All: Thank you David Norris!
Laura: The chicken is delicious!
Orion: I love chicken.
Liam: Dave, the illithids have it. Thank you, Dave.
Laura: I'm just not going to let you see me eat it.
Liam: Oh my god, her mouth opens up and tentacles come out and -
Orion: It's really scary.
Marisha: Sorry, what are we doing?
Matt: It's a good question. What are you doing?
Sam: We gotta take out the fuckers on the roof.
Laura: Right.
Sam: Do you want to try to shoot them out? Or do you want me to take Pike and fuck their shit up?
Travis: Do that.
Laura: I mean, if you can flip them off the roof that would be awesome.
Sam: That's what we're going to do.
Laura: Okay, then do it.
Liam: Wait, can we see anyone else?
Ashley: We're just going to fling them off of the roof?
Liam: Can I see duergar from any other perch?
Travis: Yep, pressure's on!
Matt: From your current position, you're up against the wall, no.
Liam: No? All right.
Matt: You can back away and take up more of a case on it if you want.
Marisha: I mean if I took eagle form I could drop you and then I could just pick one up with my eagle talons and in the lava they go.
Liam: This seems dangerous and reckless.
Marisha: It does seem very dangerous and reckless.
Liam: Let's do it?
Ashley: What if it brings attention?
Liam: Who gives a shit?
Marisha: I'm keeping my Pass Without A Trace up.
Laura: We'll just have to be fast. Be really speedy.
Orion: Can they see down to where we are? Does it just keep going?
Marisha: I'm going with you guys.
Travis: It's been over an hour, we've killed nothing, we'll kill these fucks!
Matt: So far only the two of them have really approached the stronghold and you guys have stayed back behind the elevations.
Travis: I'm a vampire. I need blood.
Matt: So you can all try, in theory, if you want to just stealth past them.
Marisha: Wait, what?
Sam: Here's my plan.
Laura: Okay!
Orion: We're not with them.
Marisha: Yeah we are, we are.
Sam: I take Pike up there. We knock those fuckers off, super easy.
Travis: Yep.
Sam: Grog runs out and brains them the second they hit the ground.
Travis: I approve of this plan.
Liam: Or fall in the lava. You just gotta shove them.
Laura: Yeah, they'll fall in the lava pit, just shove them off the side.
Sam: Maybe. I don't know where they're going to fall.
Laura: Well, just do it.
Marisha: Well, if they miss they miss the lava pit, we've got Grog.
Orion: Can I just say right now--
Laura: Just be ready to let us know if you need help.
Orion: --I'm going to be reading this book.
Marisha: Eagle form.
Liam: I'm hanging by Keyleth in case shit goes south.
Laura: Oh my god this is so stupid.
Liam: Then we're going up, right?
Marisha: Jump on my back.
Sam: What you got, Pike?
Liam: Yeah, girl.
Laura: Give me the flying carpet just in case I need to fly.
Marisha: Or I can give you a ride.
Sam: I can get you up there. What can you do when we're up there?
Ashley: There's something I've been wanting to do.
Sam: Yeah!
Travis: What do you say?
Orion: Oh my word, this is fascinating!
Laura: We're doing it!
Travis: But what do you say to get the magic carpet?
Laura: Please can I have the magic carpet?
Sam: I'm going to just look at the guard's pattern of movement. Are they staying in position, or are they walking around? Are they talking to each other at all?
Travis: Ooh, good question.
Matt: As you watch, you take a moment, still from the far back position, watch the two up there come together; they chat for a second, then a third one appears.
Sam: Oh shit.
Matt: Then one of them rotates out for the one that just arrived.
Ashley: They were switching shifts.
Matt: They both just sit there, keeping an eye. One of them cleans his bow.
Sam: Are they close to each other?
Matt: They're about twenty feet from each other along the top of the parapet.
Travis: There's three? There's three, not two?
Sam: You said twenty feet?
Matt: Twenty feet, yes.
Travis: There's three up there?
Taliesin: Now there's three.
Matt: Two.
Sam: No no, one came to swap out the other.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Travis: I’m just saying, I have been known to climb a few things in my time, if you need an extra.
Ashley: All right, let's do it.
Marisha: Are you coming too, Pike?
Ashley: Yeah! I'm a-coming up there to kill some - some things. (all laugh)
Travis: Do you have any climbing gear or anything?
Ashley: I have a grappling hook.
Liam: The ocean has changed you.
Laura: Oh my god. This is stupid.
Sam: Okay, they're standing twenty feet apart?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going to watch this all go down with Bad News.
Sam: Radius? 15 feet?
Laura: Yeah, me and you get ready to shoot.
Taliesin: I'm waiting in case--
Sam: Is the range a radius?
Marisha: So wait, who's all going?
Travis: Just those two.
Matt: No, range is how far away from you they are, and the radius is for the point of the spell.
Sam: No, I mean a range of a spell, is how far from me?
Marisha: Just those two?
Travis: Scanlan and Pike.
Laura: And you're going to bring them up if you can.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Got it. We're good.
Liam: Are they carpeting up? How are you going up?
Marisha: Are you guys going to fly on me?
Laura: They'll fly on Keyleth.
Liam: Scanlan, how are you guys going up? Eagle? Carpet?
Sam: No.
Laura: Eagle.
Liam: What?
Travis: You're climbing that shit, aren't you?
Sam: I can get there like that. We're good.
Travis: Cliffhanger. Beautiful.
Liam: Do it, Tom Cruise.
Laura: All right, do it. Mission Impossible.
Sam: All right. You ready? Do you know what you're going to do up there?
Ashley: Not really, but let's just wing it!
Sam: I'm going to try to knock them both off in one blow, but if I miss, you gotta take one.
Laura: You can charge them off if you want.
Ashley: Okay. all right. I can take one if you can take one.
Travis: You’ve got a morningstar.
Sam: Okay.
Ashley: All right.
Travis: Morningstar to the taint.
Sam: Grog, you ready to kill?
Travis: Yeah, oh yeah!
Laura: Be really quiet while you're fighting, try to take them out before they--
Taliesin: This is awesome and nothing is going to go wrong.
Marisha: Why are we using the gnomes to throw people over?
Orion: I can't believe how they wrote this.
Sam: We’re little people! You know why? Because I need someone with me and I can only take her, because that's the only other one who will fit through the Dimension Door with me.
Laura: Go!
Ashley: The Dimension Door?
Sam: Yes, we're going to go through a Dimension Door. I can take one person of my height or smaller.
Matt: All right.
Sam: So I will take Pike.
Liam: Portal, motherfucker!
Matt: You reach over and hold on to Pike gently, give her a little wink. And suddenly--
Sam: We're going to try to appear between the two of them. Exactly between the two of them.
Matt: Okay. You feel the sudden rush of air and the surrounding atmosphere of you goes from that uncomfortable warmth to a sudden freezing cold as your vision goes black and all you can see is Scanlan looking at you with this heightened grin as he's muttering these arcane incantations under his breath. An instant later, you guys are both standing at the top of the wall, with both of the duergar, one kind of facing away, one looking really surprised at the fact that you guys both appeared there. You have a surprise round. What are you doing?
Sam: I cast Thunderwave and blast out from where I'm standing between them, 15 feet in either direction.
Laura: (whispering) That's so loud!
Marisha: Isn't that loud?
Sam: So, 10 feet and 10 feet away from me.
Matt: Okay. What's your save?
Sam: Uh, 19.
Liam: But a quiet Thunderwave, right?
Matt: 19, all right.
Laura: A really quiet Thunderwave.
Orion: Thunderclap is loud. Thunderwave is different.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: But I'm pretty sure it's still thunder.
Matt: Thunderwave, looking it up real fast just to make sure of the situation.
Travis: I like this plan.
Orion: Thunder makes a noise right?
Liam: (singing) This is a triumph.
Ashley: (singing) I'm making a note here.
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: (singing) Huge success. (all laugh)
Matt: Here we go.
Sam: I don't think it's loud.
Liam: We're total fake geeks, all of us. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Such fake geeks.
Sam: Oh no - well, it's a wave of thunderous force, but it doesn't say sound. It just says thunderous force.
Matt: I would say thunderous force isn't a thunderclap,but it will make some noise.
Sam: Okay, fine.
Matt: So keep that in mind.
Laura: Keyleth, fly up and cast Pass Without Trace on them.
Matt: So, as you guys appear, you release Pike, you bring your arms up and slam your arms in a downward motion. As you do, there is a dull flash of light and a (boom noise) burst sound emanates from you.
Orion: I say, "Ooh, light."
Matt: Both of the duergar, the one who sees you, who is bringing us his crossbow to fire, gets impacted and blown off the side of the wall. The one facing away gets blown up towards, slams into the side of the wall, right at the edge, and then topples over the side, both plummeting over.
Liam: Wilhelm scream!
Ashley: Oh!
Matt: Brief Wilhelm scream. You're standing there, you watch this happen.
Ashley: I didn't have to do anything, Scanlan!
Sam: Make out with me! (all laugh)
Sam: We’re alone, it’s super romantic. I just killed two fuckers! Come on! It’s now or never, baby!
Travis: (singing) I think we’re alone now!
Ashley: (singing) Doesn’t seem to be anyone around! (all laugh)
Travis: (singing) Doesn’t seem to be anyone around! (all laugh)
Ashley: Well, let’s just wait until we’re out of danger.
Marisha: Yeah, it’s getting real romantic real quick, Scanlan.
Sam: Wait?
Ashley: But that was really hot!
Sam: It was really hot, right? Come on!
Ashley: It was.
Sam: Just a little something something?
Ashley: Let’s just--
Marisha: So sexy.
Matt: As this is happening, both of the duergar come plummeting off the side of the wall.
Liam: Friendzoned.
Matt: One manages to kind of loosely break his fall but the full 25 foot fall - he takes--
Laura: Get ready.
Liam: Come on, Grog.
Travis: I rage! (all laugh)
Matt: There’s one that lands just to the side of the magma pool that’s forming. He took some damage and is like (pained gasps) trying to get back up. He fell hard on one arm. The other one that’s further away from the magma, the one that saw you, managed to reduce his damage a little bit because it was aware at least you were there.
Sam: We have to kill these fuckers.
Matt: Looks like it took some damage, but not too much. It’s maybe 10 feet from you.
Travis: (eager laugh)
Matt: As he’s trying to get back up, he looks up and sees you charging towards him, Grog, raging. Go ahead and make your two attacks.
Laura: Yes!
Travis: (roars) 19.
Matt: 19 hits.
Travis: Nice. And 19 again!
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: I’m going to get some duergar!
Travis: 17 and 19.
Matt: So as he gets up, (grunt) he goes back for his warhammer. Before he gets a chance to, you cleave off one arm and send the axe right into the center of his torso, silencing him in an instant. He slightly spreads at the wound. (choking sound) This gurgling sound, and you just have to kick him off the edge of your axe.
Travis: I tilt him towards the pillar to spray the pillar with his gore. Look, I can make one too! Ha ha! (all laugh)
Marisha: I run across to the other one and Thorn Whip him from across the lava pool.
Matt: You have to jump over the lava to do that because he’s on the side you guys are on.
Marisha: Oh. Well then, is there anyone on the other side?
Ashley: Is he already dying, or no? He’s in the lava?
Marisha: He’s on the same side as me?
Matt: He’s on the same side as you.
Sam: He’s hurt.
Laura: We run up and kick him into the lava!
Marisha: Is he standing up or...yeah!
Matt: He’s in the process of standing up, yeah.
Laura: Can we just run up and kick him into the lava?
Marisha: Yeah, can I just run and push?
Matt: (laughs) Okay, all right, so…
Liam: I use pushing attack!
Travis: (grunts) Hunh!
Marisha: (grunts) Hunh!
Sam: (high voice) I’m sorry!
Marisha: (laughing) Yes, exactly! (all laugh)
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll athletics.
Marisha: This is the meanest thing I’ve ever done!
Liam: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Laura: No, no, remember you killed that kid one time.
Marisha: Oh, thanks for bringing that up, Vax! (all laugh)
Laura: I’m Vex, he’s Vax!
Travis: That’s some dark shit! That’s some dark shit!
Marisha: Oh, I thought it was Vex and Vax. Every time I get confused.
Matt: (laughing) It’s a long story!
Ashley: Oh my god. Remember you killed that kid one time?
Liam: Two and a half years in and Keyleth has just learned our names.
Marisha: I get them confused.
Sam: I do too. All the time.
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: All the time.
Marisha: See, no one else has any idea!
Orion: I have your names written down!
Liam: I’m Vex, okay? It’s simple!
Sam: No, no! That is not true!
Laura: No, no, don’t do that. He’s lying.
Marisha: (laughing) Two years, and I just don’t.
Matt: So, as the terrible blood spray occurs across the nearby pillar on Grog’s side, the other duergar is getting up with his crossbow, trying to get it ready. You rush forward. Go ahead and roll athletics.
Marisha: Oh!
Ashley: Come on!
Laura: Oh no!
Orion: As she does this, I notice everything, and I sit down.
Marisha: This is for that kid!
Orion: And turn to the next chapter in my book.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (singing) He had it coming, he had it coming.
Ashley: This is quite a good read!
Marisha: It could be worse. 14.
Matt: That’s okay. He rolled a 1.
Laura: Ooh! Yes!
Matt: So, as the duergar is getting up, he goes - (grunt) You just run up and - boom! And he falls back - (hissing SFX) (screams) - and starts giving a horrible, painful scream as he’s essentially flailing in the magma, melting.
Ashley: Someone shoot him in the mouth.
Marisha: I say, shh! Shh! Shh! And I wind down to push him under the lava!
Ashley: Oh, this is brutal!
Orion: That’s not what it’s called.
Matt: Okay. So, as he’s screaming your Wind Wall shoves him further under the magma as he’s screaming, cooling the magma around him as the rock (cracking SFX) cracks around him, turning into black rock--
Marisha: I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
Matt: --his face still visible over the surface, going (choking SFX) in this horrible, almost Han-in-carbonite type of look at the top of the magma pool.
Laura: Keyleth!
Liam: You just one-upped Grog, man.
Travis: That was awesome!
Matt: As fresh magma now begins to pool over the cool, covering his face, you step away.
Sam: Piss on the body!
Travis: I never knew you were an artist.
Marisha: (laughs nervously)
Matt: However, the subtle sound of the Thunderwave and then the horrible screams of pain, you can hear footsteps coming toward the wall edge where both you and Pike are currently on. What are you going to do?
Laura: Run! Or can you turn yourselves into duergar?
Sam: Is there a door or something?
Matt: Not from your current position, no. You’re just on a five foot ledge of the second story.
Sam: Of the fortress. Oh, it’s not a standalone tower. It’s part of a larger wall.
Ashley: How far of a jump down is it?
Matt: It’s about 25 feet.
Laura: What, am I too excited about it? Turn yourself into a duergar! Make it seem like everything’s okay!
Ashley: Should we call Grog?
Sam: No, I’ll do the same thing to get us down.
Ashley: Oh yeah, Dimension Door!
Sam: Unless you want to stay and fight.
Matt: You’ve got 20 seconds.
Marisha: Wait, what’s happening?
Ashley: We could try to stay and fight?
Liam: Turn into a duergar! (cawing sounds)
Laura: Turn into a duergar! Act like you’re a duergar! Say everything’s okay!
Ashley: Turn into a duergar?
Sam: Should we get out of here?
Ashley: Yeah, let’s get out.
Sam: Okay, we’re going to Dimension Door out.
Matt: Okay. So you grab her, (magic SFX) back down to the bottom.
Travis: Cast that shit.
Matt: They reappear at the bottom.
Orion: Are you done?
Marisha: Okay, I cast Wall of Stone, but right over top of where I see that lip. But I don't want to bring it out far. Just like, halfsies.
Sam: (laughs) Just the tip.
Marisha: Just the tip.
Ashley: Does it stop the magma?
Matt: As you guys appear at the bottom--
Marisha: So it goes like magma flow, here's the wall, I want it to go - (grinding noise)
Matt: --you guys hear footprints along the wall. They don't seem to have seen you yet. At which point there's this (grinding and thump sounds) sound of shifting rock. A giant stone wall juts out the side of the fortress right where the lava pool was pouring over the side. As it does, the lava pools on top of the wall and is offset, leaving a small gap where you guys can try to squeeze through. You can see, right underneath where it was, there is a stone doorway. It does not appear to have a handle or anything, it's just a stone door.
Sam: How do we get in?
Liam: Tiberius, fly up there quick.
Orion: What?
Liam: Stop eating chicken and fly up to that door.
Orion: Oh.
Ashley: Where did you get that chicken?
Orion: What's going on?
Liam: There's a magic doorway up there, I don't see any handles or anything.
Matt: It's right underneath the lava.
Liam: Oh, it’s on the ground?
Matt: Basically she put the stone wall out. It pours off.
Orion: It's right there! What are you talking about?
Liam: I walk up to it and take a look.
Laura: Oh yeah, that was good. Maybe Grog can push it!
Orion: I'm going to do an Arcana check.
Liam: Do I have advantage?
Matt: Uh, no.
Laura: Can Grog push it?
Liam: All right, take a look, dude.
Travis: No, he's doing an arcana check.
Sam: Grog, just kill it!
Marisha: (laughing) Go kill it, just punch the door!
Orion: 22.
Matt: 22? As you guys are inspecting this, in the time you've taken to do this, both the duergar up on top have seen you, and are both taking shots at you.
Sam: Oh shit.
Taliesin: I was waiting for that anyways so, I'm going to--
Marisha: He was waiting.
Matt: As they appear on the top, you guys who have your arrow and gun at the ready, both take a shot then they get a retribution shot.
Liam: Keyleth!
Marisha: What?
Liam: Let's go up!
Marisha: Go up?
Liam: Up to them, quick.
Marisha: I want see how they fare.
Liam: That’s going to be about 6 seconds.
Matt: The door is not magical. It is a mechanism of some kind.
Laura: 65. Oh, 65? (laughter) Shit.
Sam: I rolled a 65.
Liam: 65? Holy shit you're a deity!
Laura: I'm amazing!
Orion: Vax. Pay attention, the door mechanical, it is not magical. That's how we open it.
Laura: 25.
Matt: 25. Percy? And you get 2 attacks each. So - (zipping SFX)
Taliesin: I hit a 23.
Matt: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll second attack.
Taliesin: Okay, roll damage.
Matt: Well, roll both attacks first.
Laura: 18 for the second one.
Matt: Hits as well.
Taliesin: I have to reload with my second attack.
Matt: Oh right. Is this with the Bad News?
Taliesin: I've got the big gun out.
Matt: You’ve got the Bad News out. Okay then, yeah. So you fire and then reload. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: I'm using my fire bow.
Matt: You're using the fire bowstring. As you nock your first arrow, (swoosh sound) it bursts into flame as it hits your fingers.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Marisha: (dejected groan)
Taliesin: 7 damage.
Matt: 7 damage? Okay.
Taliesin: I'm so embarrassed.
Matt: I'm sorry.
Liam: (gunshot sound) You got me right in the ear.
Laura: 20 damage on the first attack.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Come on, Vex.
Laura: 13 on the second.
Matt: Okay, as both are going up with their crossbows ready to go, first one, Bad News - (gunshot sound) - with a cacophonous echoing gunshot that within this cavern, definitely carries some sound to it. And to some degree, suprise may be a little harder to find going forward.
Taliesin: They were ready to start shooting at us.
Matt: However, the shot hits the guy in the shoulder, knocks him off balance for a second. Not enough of a wound to prevent his next action. You, however, place one arrow into the other guy’s shoulder. He's dropped the crossbow. As he goes to reach for his other weapon, the other one just, right at the bottom of his throat, out the back of his head, and he just drops below the wall.
Ashley: Awesome.
Matt: The other one does get a crossbow shot off at you, Percy. That is a 23 versus armor class.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: You take 9 points of piercing damage. As the bolt just streaks you across the front of your torso. Passes through, thankfully, but you do feel there is a wound that’s slowly turning warmer beneath your armor.
Laura: Can I shoot at the other one?
Matt: That's been the round. Now, you guys have been inspecting the door. The door is not magical. There is some sort of contraption that opens it from the inside.
Liam: I’m getting my picks out, seeing if I can figure out some way to--
Matt: Go ahead and make a check with your thieves’ tools.
Liam: 29.
Matt: A 29. You take a second and you find that the contraption that holds this door in place definitely is on the other side. It's a series of winches and a chain pull. You find that there is one slight gap where you manage to hook one of the chains, pull it out ever so slightly, and you know with a strong yank from a strong person, you could probably pull it out from the outside.
Orion: Grog!
Travis: Sounds like we need a strong person.
Liam: So this is the part where I ask Grog over to pull. Grog, grab this--
Ashley: I'll do it! I'll do it. (all laugh)
Travis: Yeah, me and Pike are on this.
Ashley: I'll assist.
Matt: Grog, you reach over and grab the chain, and Pike grabs onto the back of you and you both pull.
Travis: Give it a good heave-ho.
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check with advantage.
Travis: Oh yeah, 23.
Matt: 23. As you pull, you hear the grinding of this chain against the stone, (cracking SFX) and you can see the actual door begin to rise upward this way.
Sam: It's a Delorean.
Matt: Essentially. When it opens up, it moves the magma out of the way. That's how this construct is used as an exit. It's what I mentioned before. This is supposed to be an exit for the royal individuals of the stronghold. It only opens part way, however, because the stone wall currently blocks the rest of its movement. However, you can still move through it.
Liam: We can't leave this duergar behind though, we gotta take him out.
Matt: Yes, there is one duergar still there. So that's been all of your guys' actions. We're bringing it back. Pike, you haven't gone yet.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Keyleth you've gone, so the only one left to take an action is--
Marisha: Tiberius, have you gone?
Matt: Yeah, he checked the doorway.
Marisha: Oh right.
Ashley: Where's he at?
Matt: He's up on top of the wall, about 25 feet from you.
Ashley: I want to create a spiritual weapon, like a poisonous lasso, and (whiff SFX) and then put him down into the lava.
Matt: Huh. Sure. (all laugh)
Sam: A lariat of truth?
Travis: That's awesome.
Taliesin: Well, all right then.
Matt: So using your spiritual weapon, you take a moment, you grasp your Sarenrae holy symbol around your neck, and as you pull your hand away from the symbol you see this glowing celestial rope extends out of nowhere. You begin to spin your fingers, and on its own, it begins to swirl and swirl. You then throw your hand forward and on its own, it cascades upward toward the edge of the wall. Go ahead and roll an attack roll.
Ashley: An attack roll? Which is?
Matt: Using your spell modifier as the attack bonus.
Ashley: 10.
Sam: Ooh. That ain't gonna do it.
Matt: Total of 10?
Ashley: I think so. (all laugh)
Matt: What'd you roll?
Ashley: I rolled a 2, and then I have a plus 8.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: That ain't no good.
Liam: It was a good idea though.
Laura: It was such a good idea.
Matt: The celestial lasso, which you don't get the feeling poison is something you could really muster based on your deity's central good--
Ashley: I was just kidding! I was just getting a little crazy with ideas.
Matt: I like it. However, as it heads over the wall, you see it does not find purchase on the duergar. It instead finds purchase on part of the wall.
Ashley: Fuck.
Travis: Poisoning the wall effectively.
Matt: Yes, it is now a poisoned property.
Ashley: (laughs) Poisoning that wall, effectively. Gosh dang it. That would have been cool.
Matt: That would have been cool, unfortunate bad roll.
Travis: It was going to be pretty cool.
Liam: Remember it for the future though.
Matt: That brings us to the top of the round order. I believe at the top we have--
Sam: Mister Me?
Matt: Yes, Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. Boy, oh boy. We're still trying to get that fucker up on the roof right?
Liam: Yes, he's going to run and tell people.
Sam: I've got almost nothing. So I'll just - can I summon an Unseen Servant to push him? (all laugh)
Marisha: Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
Matt: We can give it a shot.
Travis: Roll high. Roll really high.
Sam: I don't have any ranged weapons.
Laura: Natural 20!
Matt: So you conjure Unseen Servant. Mark off your spell use.
Orion: I look up and go, "Ooh, It's Monty's cousin."
Matt: You see a slight shimmer of ethereal energy behind the duergar. It's going to attempt to shove him. It isn't, unfortunately, on its own, extremely strong. It's mainly meant as an aide. However, it is possible. Go ahead and make an athletics check. Not your athletics, just make a d20 roll.
Sam: Just a normal athletics.
Liam: Come on, 20.
Sam: Yeah, I mean it's a 5, so. (all laugh)
Ashley: What's your athletics? We're really rolling well tonight.
Matt: You hear a (ting) sound as the duergar's armor is given a hefty slap, but no apparent force is placed upon its body.
Orion: A hefty slap.
Sam: Thank you, Jarvis! (all laugh)
Sam: But is he confused?
Matt: A little bit, but not enough to not be loading his crossbow for a second shot.
Sam: Damn it!
Matt: Good thinking on that point.
Marisha: We're a party of 7 people just like, "Aw, damn it, you!"
Taliesin: Like a cat in a tree, just - (beckoning whistle)
Sam: And I'm going to just give a little inspiration to Vax. That's Laura, obviously. (all laugh)
Laura: Yes, thank you.
Marisha: It inverted. That's what I always get mixed.
Matt: All right, a d8 inspiration die to you as Scanlan hums a little tune under his breath.
Laura: Nice.
Sam: (hums Dueling Banjos)
Matt: You're up.
Laura: Oh! I attack him.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Pew pew.
Ashley: Pew pew!
Laura: It's good.
Liam: It's a 1.
Marisha: Damn it! What is wrong with us?
Travis: What in the hot and holy shit is happening right now?
Ashley: What are we doing?
Matt: That's your first attack?
Laura: My first attack is a serious fail. My second attack, though, is a 25.
Matt: That hits.
Marisha: That's pretty cool.
Matt: So the first one you pull back, and as you pull back the actual arrow snaps.
Liam: You almost shot me!
Laura: Ow, that hurt my arm so bad.
Matt: Yeah, you're gonna have a little rash there probably tomorrow.
Laura: Great. 8.
Matt: 8 damage, all right. Your second arrow manages to find its mark. As it sticks pretty close to where the first arrow hit, or where he was shot from the Bad News. The duergar just shrugs it off angrily, and aims his crossbow from once on Percy, now onto you.
Laura: (nervously) Haha.
Matt: It's getting its shot at you. That is a 17 versus armor class.
Laura: Nope.
Matt: Nope?
Laura: Nope.
Matt: You manage to just dodge out of the way. You hear it whiz past your ear. That brings us to Percy.
Taliesin: I'll take one more shot at him.
Liam: Redemption, Percy.
Travis: Come on, buddy.
Sam: Kill this guy.
Ashley: Get it.
Sam: He's lasted longer than most of the people we fight.
Marisha: (laughing) Yeah he has.
Taliesin: 18?
Matt: 18 hits.
Taliesin: Come on die.
Travis: Come on, Percy.
Liam: Right in the belly button.
Marisha: Oh, that's nice. That's pretty.
Taliesin: That's 25 points of damage.
Travis: Thank you!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: With a second (click), you pull out one of your custom made, nasty looking bullets, load it back into Bad News. You pull it back, aim up, and fire. And once again, you guys are seeing this weapon up close again. With each fire, it takes all of his physical body to not get blown off his feet with each time it fires.
Laura: That's badass, Percy.
Matt: (thunder crack) A plume of white and ash-like smoke comes shooting out the side of the weapon. Nearby, you almost have to close your ears instinctually from the loudness of the shot. However, the duergar at the top of the wall, you see where his head once was just (wet impact SFX) across the wall behind it.
Ashley: I love Bad News.
Taliesin: Let's move quickly.
Laura: Let's get in the door.
Sam: I think they heard us.
Orion: I go in the door.
Taliesin: Going in the door.
Laura: We all go in the door.
Matt: All of you have made your way into the doorway.
Laura: Can Trinket fit? Trinket can fit.
Matt: Trinket can fit with you, yes.
Liam: Just barely.
Ashley: Just bear-ly.
Liam: It's like Winnie the Pooh, in the--
Laura: If Grog can fit, Trinket can fit.
Taliesin: It’s the one you don’t suit.
Travis: Oh no, we can't see anything.
Matt: You guys make your way into this tiny little room--
All: Whoa!
Matt: You're all very crammed in, to get anywhere.
Laura: Into this (high voice) teeny-tiny little room.
Liam: Feels like an intermission room.
Laura: Oh. A bathroom break room?
Liam: Yes. We could all relieve ourselves in this room.
Matt: You guys all slowly push into this storage room. It's very musty. It hasn't seen use in quite a while. In fact, you can see a little bit of mold is growing on the side of one of the barrels in the corner.
Orion: Ooh, dank.
Matt: There is a doorway that is closed on the opposite side of this wall, and from what you can see, there is a stairway that curves upwards to the second floor.
Laura: Ooh!
Sam: Guys, I'm sensing a lot of purple and brown construction paper here. (all laugh)
Orion: I am as well, Scanlan.
Liam: That's your favored terrain, right?
Sam: It is. (all laugh)
Laura: Can we take an intermission break at this moment?
Matt: I think as you guys just entered the stronghold, we'll take this as an intermission break. So take a little over 10 minutes. We'll watch the rest of the videos here again, and we'll return as the party has just entered the Emberhold itself.
Laura: All right. Oh wait, quick announcement.
Zac: A couple quick announcements.
Liam: Zac matches the construction paper.
Laura: What?!
Marisha: You do! (all laugh)
Zac: You can't see me! So guys before we go on intermission, I wanted to bring up one more time 826LA which is the charity that Critical Role is supporting. Do you want to give a brief--
Marisha: Yeah. A portion of our proceeds, or whatever our donations are, go to 826LA. They are an after-school tutoring program that help children between the ages of 5 and 18, mainly with literacy and creative writing and they have this awesome program where it's a young authors thing. You can buy all their books and their stories, and you should totally check them out.
Zac: Sweet!
Matt: Fantastic.
Zac: So guys, we can spam you with that link in the chatroom if you want to support a charity for Critical Role. We also still have a giveaway at 2150 subs, which is a picture of the entire Critical Role cast they've all signed, and it's really cool. We'll show that to you guys again later, but we'll go ahead and roll those videos for you guys again.
Matt: See if we can squeeze the intro again, that would be best. All right, cool guys, we'll see you again in a little bit.
Ashley: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream. A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar) (wet smack sounds) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! ...also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this... well this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. (weapon crack) Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. (brawling sounds) Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! ...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for... lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first Impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder crack) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third child of 7 children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men. As they ran, Percy’s sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (click sound) (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he’s never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it’s rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes. I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Singorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn’t last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (dragon roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough, (ringing weapons SFX) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Singorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear - her own stolen Trinket - to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages. (drumming battle music) (drumming battle music continues)
Orion: Still alive!
Matt: (laughs) Welcome back, guys. Welcome back to Critical Role. And we have Orion -- .
Liam: Holy hell.
Taliesin: Ow.
Marisha: Are you okay?
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Matt: 2d6 damage to Tiberius. So, guys, for those who are keeping up: two things, real fast. We want to thank Jacqueline Lassiter for the awesome food she sent for us.
All: (words of acclamation and thanks)
Matt: Seriously, thank you. A delightful, necessary treat after this game time. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. Also for the 2,150-subscriber mark, we're giving away this autographed photo of the cast.
Laura: Autographed photo.
Matt: We'll send out to you.
Liam: It's so handsome.
Marisha: Who is it going to?
Matt: Some lucky person in the chatroom once we hit 2,150.
Marisha: Oh. We don't know yet.
Matt: Whenever that happens, that will be going to you. So, yes, returning to the game--
Sam: Also, we've got these t-shirts. You should want them. (Laura and Marisha laugh)
Matt: We're going to now look into--
Marisha: Yes, let us know if you want them.
Laura: We're going to look into that.
Matt: We're going to look into possibly finding a way to get these shirts to you guys in the next couple weeks.
Marisha: Only if you want them, though. This is going to be a lot of work. We don't want to do it unless you really want them.
Orion: We hate doing work.
Travis: We're voice actors.
Taliesin: We're not here to work.
Sam: Where are we? We were just going in a door.
Matt: Indeed. You guys--
Liam: Come on. Yes, they want them.
Matt: Cool. I guess that feedback is good. The party had just managed to not-quite-so-stealthily pry their way into the hidden entrance to the outside of the duergar stronghold of Emberhold. They found themselves crammed into a very tiny, essentially a storage room, with a stairway leading up and a closed doorway leading further into the stronghold. So, what is your preference?
Laura: I think we should go through the door, instead of going up.
Liam: I agree.
Laura: Because any prisoners are probably going to be kept at a low level.
Taliesin: Can we quietly open the door?
Matt: Yeah, once inside.
Laura: Can we very stealthily try to open - oh, check for traps!
Liam: Yes, I'm going to sniff the door a bit.
Matt: All right.
Laura: (sniffing SFX)
Liam: Yeah, that's a 20.
Matt: 20? Best you can tell, the door itself is locked, but is not trapped.
Liam: Okay, well - (clinking SFX) Okay, thieves’ tools out. Oh, that's an easy 30.
Sam: 30?!
Matt: A 30!
Liam: 30.
Sam: Jesus.
Marisha: God damn.
Matt: Which is good because it's a very, very intricate lock. There is a specific key, a single key that is designed for this lock, that you gather is probably held by King Murghol himself.
Ashley: King Myrtle?
Laura: Mairgil. Mare - Mairgil?
Matt: Mur-ghol.
Marisha: Marigold.
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: Murghol.
Sam: And his queen, Durarara.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: Is that how you pronounce her name? Doo-gara-gar?
Liam: It's, uh, Ermahgerd?
All: Ermahgerd.
Laura: Ulara is her name.
Orion: Kuma.
Laura: Queen Ulara.
Sam: Ulara. Uhura.
Matt: Yes. Uhura.
Marisha: Uhura.
Taliesin: Kana.
Matt: Kumar.
Marisha: I don't know! What is her name? Seriously, what is her name, now?
Laura: It's Ulara! Ulara.
Sam: Ulara.
Marisha: What is -- ?
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: Ulara.
Marisha: Ulara. (giggles)
Matt: Shh.
Taliesin: Maybe not.
Marisha: Uladra. Right?
Liam: I'm picking a lock.
Laura: Shh. He's picking a lock. Be very quiet.
Liam: (clicking SFX)
Matt: However, you do manage to find a series of intricate, strangely-constructed dwarven tumblers on the inside that each have a very strange, rigid structure -- (laughs)
Liam: ‘Ey!
Matt: Please do that every time you pick a lock. You manage to get the right sequence, and with a slight - (clicking SFX) - clicking sound, (squeak SFX) the door opens slightly on the inside.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: It was pretty easy.
Matt: Leading into what you can see is a hallway, that continues further down to about there.
Liam: Where is the door? Where is the door that I just picked?
Matt: The door that you picked, if you wanted to walk through is right there.
Liam: It's naturally there.
Laura: So that other stuff is upstairs.
Matt: All of this is on the floor that you're on.
Laura: Oh! Okay.
Liam: I'm going to take six or seven quiet steps forward, stealthily. 19 stealth.
Matt: All right.
Orion: As he does this, I'm going to pull out my Ioun stone from my pouch, and let it-- (whirling SFX)
Matt: All right, cool.
Travis: We're all trapped in that room together, right?
Matt: You are. Correct.
Travis: I fart. (all laugh)
Orion: Oh! Grog! Prestidigitation, and I (whoosh SFX) make a quick wind-gust--
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Just circulate it around the room, will you?
Orion: I blew it away! I could blow it right up your nose, Vax! (fluttering SFX)
Travis: I'm closer to you now than I've ever been before.
Laura: I throw up in my mouth just a little bit.
Taliesin: Go around the corner and tell us what you see.
Matt: Just a little bit.
Orion: Oh. I'm sorry.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: Take a very quiet peek around the corner.
Liam: All right, I'm having a peeky-poo.
Taliesin: Quietly.
Matt: As you peek through, you can get a general idea of what looks to be some sort of an empty storage room. A lot of materials have been moved out of it. It looks like the remnants of stone, things that were used for construction that once were in this room that have been pulled out to build things. Possibly moved as part of the war camp to start building some of the siege weapons that you saw above.
Liam: Do I hear anything?
Matt: Not currently. Roll a perception check.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Oh, that's good.
Liam: That's pretty good. 27.
Matt: Listening, you hear footsteps above. You hear very, very faintly through the stonework about 20 feet above you - (thumping SFX) - some footsteps moving above. Apparently there is some level of alert on the second floor.
Laura: Oh, shit. We should move fast.
Marisha: Hmm. I wonder why.
Liam: Go figure.
Laura: We should get out of the room.
Orion: Yes, Percy, I wonder why.
Laura: We start getting out of the room.
Taliesin: It’s a wonder, looking outside.
Liam: I go back to the door and just be like--
Laura: (whispering) Come on. Hurry!
Liam: So, I want to go further - no doorway, as of yet. Correct?
Matt: No doorway here.
Liam: If I go this way--
Laura: They're going to start coming down these fricking stairs in this room.
Matt: This way? It ends. The hallway comes to an end, with a wall.
Liam: Well then, I'm going to peek into this door here. This open door.
Matt: Here?
Liam: No. What's right by the figure?
Matt: This is the one you just looked into that had this empty room that--
Liam: Thank you, thank you. So, down the one hall.
Matt: Down the one hall. Look past here there is a stairway that descends downward.
Liam: Down.
Matt: Looking down - pardon me. Looking down this hallway, you see what resembles - there's a door to your left that's closed currently, and it splits off into two directions, right and left.
Liam: Right, I don't even tell anyone. I just start to slink down the steps.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Did he go down?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Oh, geez Louise.
Matt: Okay. Put Clarota there. You continue down the stairway, and as you slowly move around, you can see down towards the bottom a very faint bit of reddish glow-stone light and a hallway that splits right and left. Laura: (whispering) We should go downstairs.
Liam: Right and left? I go to the right.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Why don’t we just go left?
Laura: We're getting bored.
Matt: As you look past the right - you guys are all waiting in the room?
Liam: You should just storm in.
Laura: I get out.
Liam: Start banging your weapons together.
Laura: No! I come out, because you're taking too long.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: Anyone else?
Orion: I saunter about. (all laugh)
Ashley: I'll head on out there.
Sam: I go where Pike goes.
Marisha: We're just losing all attention span? Is that what's going on? We're just wandering off.
Laura: No no no. I said we stay in the area, but I wanted to check on my brother because I feel like he's taking awhile.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And he was just gonna check the doors.
Matt: As you move and glance over, you can see there are two duergar stationed on each side of the split hallways. One is a closed doorway to your right, and to the left there's an open doorway that leads into a room.
Liam: And that's when I went to the right?
Matt: Well, as soon as you went into where the division was, you turned to the right and there were duergar there, and a duergar on the left.
Liam: I'm going to turn my chin over to the left, and see what I see down there.
Matt: There's a second duergar that is currently sitting in armor, weapon to its side. Just occasionally glancing in. You can hear, every now and then, sounds like a moan or a slight whispering gurgle, and the duergar will lean in - "Hey, shut up in there! 'Kay?!"
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to go kill this guy.
Laura: You don't want to tell us what you found?
Orion: As I notice him going up, I'm going to - (click) Vax, what are you doing?
Liam: (softly) Uh, I'm killing someone. Hold, please. (all laughing)
Sam: (humming a Muzak version of "The Girl from Ipanema")
Orion: Uh, guys, Vax is going to go kill something.
Marisha: It's okay. Let him do it by himself. It's what he does best.
Liam: I'm going to sneak up on this duergar.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Orion: I worry.
Marisha: I know. It's okay.
Liam: 19?
Matt: 19? Let me go ahead and--
Laura: Oh, no! Look at this.
Matt: This'll be an interesting--
Liam: Like a magician, you just whip it out, Matt.
Matt: That's what I'm doing. Trying, at least. There we go.
Travis: Do you want an extra hand?
Taliesin: If Mr. Wizard can do it, you can do it.
Sam: Watch out! LAURA It's that book.
Matt: Oh, it is the book, isn't it? Stupid book. As you've made your way here, Vex [sic] you look to the right. There's the duergar here to the left that's shouting into this room here.
Sam: Do something!
Matt: You missed entirely what I was telling you.
Travis: Will you fucking do something, please?
Liam: He's right there on the side. There's one over there, there's one over there. There's two. Oh, shit. Well, we all come slamming down in here.
Sam: Yeah!
Travis: No, you're down there.
Liam: So I sneak back up and I put a hand on my sister's shoulder, and I give her a little come along motion. And tell everyone else--
Sam: Don't you need some Grog?
Liam: --I mouth "Kima" at everybody, and then pull my sister down.
Matt: As you're doing this, you hear footsteps across the way echoing through the hallway, what sounds like a number of other foot patters heading through the halls--
Laura: (gasps) We should just go down.
Matt: --towards the front of the stronghold.
Liam: I'm just pulling Vex down.
Orion: The front? Oh, the front of the front. Not where we're at, right?
Matt: Vex and Vax both disappear off to the side, down a hallway.
Marisha: Before they leave I just tap their shoulders and meditate and grant them Guidance.
Matt: Okay, you can give one of them Guidance because it's concentration.
Marisha: Uh, Vex.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: That's me.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Fuck.
Laura: Did you mean to give it to him?
Marisha: Yes. (everyone laughs)
Orion: Brava.
Matt: All right, who gets guidance?
Sam: The man one.
Matt: Vax.
Marisha: Vax.
Liam: So I pull my poison blade out and I pull the keen dagger out. Okay, and I take the keen dagger - so the one on the left is by the door and the one that muttered through the doorway, right?
Matt: The one right here.
Liam: So I give a little fwip, toss in my hand and throw it right at his neck.
Laura: At the same time I reach out and I go (arrow SFX).
Liam: And the other one, the poison one, toward the other.
Matt: Okay and you are?
Laura: And I was going to shoot at the other one.
Matt: Go ahead and roll for this guy here.
Liam: That guy. That is a 17 for me.
Matt: 17 hits.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27, all right.
Liam: And then on the other guy, or should I just go ahead and attack?
Matt: Go ahead and attack both.
Liam: 17. So that’s--
Laura: And 25 on the same.
Matt: Both arrows on the guy on the right?
Laura: Let’s do both, one on each.
Matt: Each? (shooting SFX) You both - (impact SFX) - ?
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: Okay, cool. Damage on the one on the left? Which is sneak attack because he didn’t know you were there.
Liam: So, 46 with the keen dagger on the guard at the door.
Taliesin: Damn.
Laura: So I was really useful!
Matt: The guy on the left, as he’s leaning back, he’s getting angry with whoever is in that room. As he turns back to take his post again, (swoosh SFX) (gurgling) he just gurgles, slumps to the ground. As he’s slumping, an arrow goes (impact sound) into his stomach. (everyone laughs)
Liam: It’s like a punctuation.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Matt: Roll damage for the second attack.
Liam: The poison dagger goes (thunk sound). Well, I didn’t roll to hit him.
Matt: And you are using the poison effect on him?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: 15 on the other guy for me.
Liam: That is a 19.
Matt: Okay, that hits. Now roll damage.
Liam: This doesn’t get sneak attack?
Matt: No.
Liam: Because I already used that. I made some noise hitting the first guy. 7 plus the poison.
Matt: What is the poison damage?
Liam: The poison is DC 15.
Matt: He does not make the save, even though he’s a duergar.
Laura: I go running back up since I’ve already shot my arrows.
Matt: Let me check one thing real fast.
Laura: And I figured you’ve got this.
Matt: Check one thing.
Ashley: He could just clear this whole place by himself.
Liam: 9 points of poison on him.
Matt: Okay. So, an arrow (impact SFX) into his chest just as the poison blade makes contact. You can see him (gurgling SFX) double over for a second, but the hardy duergar once-dwarven form seems to shrug off a lot of the poison’s impact.
Laura: Oh, shit!
Matt: He is still dribbling a very heavy amount of deep crimson from his mouth, but he still (gasps) looks over and sees you both in the hallway and goes to reach for his warhammer and turn around towards the door behind him.
Laura: Can I throw an arrow at him?
Liam: Do we roll for initiative at this point?
Matt: You guys roll for initiative to see who goes first.
Sam: I turn to Pike and say, "What the fuck is going on? Where are they?"
Orion: I don’t know, but this book, Scanlan, is incredible.
Sam: I’m sure it is.
Orion: It’s all about this, er, an ice thing--
Sam: I read non-fiction.
Orion: --and these other things.
Ashley: Let’s head down there. I’m going to head down there.
Liam: Careful, clanky.
Ashley: Oh.
Matt: So the rest of you are heading down there?
Travis: I follow Pike down there.
Sam: I’m going, too.
Laura: There are so many prisoners down this way.
Matt: Everyone else roll stealth checks.
Laura: Everybody fucking come down.
Marisha: Are we going down?
Matt: Stealth checks everyone. You guys both beat him on initiative.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Roll attacks, both of you, just roll the dice.
Sam: Roll the dice.
Orion: Roll the dice.
Ashley: 19.
Liam: 28.
Ashley: Getting a handle on my armor.
Matt: Okay. You don’t need to roll damage. He has like, 2 hit points left. You guys pepper him with additional arrows and daggers. The poor guys is like: "Uh, I’m gonna--" (impact SFX, gurgle) He just goes down with this horrible sense of overkill, his body just slumps up against the door, leaning against the wooden door he was guarding.
Laura: I say on my earring "I think we found the prison cells. Get down here."
Sam: We’re coming.
Orion: I’m assuming they’re dead.
Matt: Both duergar.
Liam: I start to loot the bodies.
Matt: Stealth checks?
Orion: 16.
Marisha: 17.
Taliesin: 12.
Sam: 12.
Travis: 20.
Ashley: 19.
Matt: All right, go team!
Marisha: Woo! We’re stealthy bastards.
Matt: That was with disadvantage?
Ashley: I have to roll again?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Why?
Matt: Because you’re in heavy plate armor.
Marisha: No!
Laura: No!
All: (words of encouragement)
Ashley: (laughs)
Laura: That’s not bad, that’s still not bad.
Ashley: I rolled an 8.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Plus what?
Ashley: Plus nothing. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (clanking SFX)
Matt: You guys, all rush down the stairs (stomping SFX) the clanking of the plate armor as you're going down. The rest of you wince as you notice it, but you make it down anyway.
Ashley: (laughing) Oh my God.
Travis: I should have picked you up.
Marisha: I'm actually going to go ahead and throw Guidance on Pike now.
Sam: Little late, little late.
Taliesin: What does Guidance do?
Marisha: It gives you a plus on your ability checks. And it gives you a 1d4 plus to your-- (several talking at once)
Sam: Do they already knew [sic] we were here? Now they really know.
Matt: So, the rest of you have made it down.
Liam: Surprise!
Matt: In this hallway, there are 2 dead duergar on the ground. One with a closed door and one with an open door.
Laura: Well, let's go look in the open door. Stealthily.
Matt: You glance over into the open door, you can see what appears to be a series of dungeon cells held underneath the stronghold.
Liam: Lady Kima?
Matt: Within these, you can see there are a number of dwarven captives that are in very, very, very poor health--
Taliesin: I don't care about them.
Laura: We need to get them awake.
Matt: --that are currently lying down, unfed, gaunt.
Sam: Are any of them Lady Kima? Because if they're not, they're about to die.
Laura: No, they're regular dwarves, they're good people.
Orion: I go inspect them and see what's going on.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'll go in with Tiberius.
Matt: Okay, you guys enter. As you look around, there are a series of largely decomposed bodies in a few of these cells. They are people who've just been left to die.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: One, there are these kind of strange deep underground, rat-like creatures that are feeding on one of them. One of the dwarves is just wheezing in pain (moaning). You can see his stomach is a little distended. The other one is either unconscious, asleep, or dead. You can't tell.
Ashley: Can I do a Mass Cure on them?
Matt: You can if you'd like.
Ashley: Okay. I'll do that.
Liam: Yes, I was about to say. I'm going to go start inspecting the other door.
Taliesin: I'll go with him.
Laura: Why don't you unlock the prison cells here?
Marisha: Yeah, can you unlock the prison cells?
Liam: Oh, sorry.
Laura: Can we go in? Can we talk to them?
Matt: If you guys want to. So you go through. It's fairly simple over time for you to unlock the cells if you'd like, the 2 that are in there. There's a difference between healing magic and nutrition. You make them feel physically better for the moment, but their physical form itself is failing.
Travis: Just a thought, shouldn't we clear this mess before we let prisoners out?
Matt: They need food, they need air, they need to be out of here soon. They're both on the edge of death.
Sam: Put them in the bag of holding, Grog.
Marisha: I pull out a water.
Orion: I go to the room, I take out my bottle of water..
Marisha: I'll do the opposite one.
Matt: You guys hear heavy footsteps coming from the stairway you guys just descended from.
Travis: I go stand right next to the stairway.
Marisha: In the cells, in the cells.
Taliesin: In the cells, in the cells.
Liam: I pull my sister and we flank. I push her into flanking position to the door.
Laura: Oh God, I nock an arrow, notch an arrow?
Orion: Where are they coming from?
Liam: The stairs, from where we entered?
Matt: What are you guys doing?
Marisha: I jump in the cells and I pull a dead, decomposing corpse over the top of me.
Laura: Eww, Keyleth. All kinds of nastiness.
Taliesin: I find a corner of a cell and slowly pull out my gun.
Marisha: I’m going savage! (all laugh)
Taliesin: I should make sure all the doors are shut, not locked.
Matt: All right, all the doors are shut. Pike, anything you doing?
Ashley: I'm just, you know, preparing.
Matt: (laughs) All right.
Marisha: Just kicking it, just chilling.
Laura: Do we need to move out of the way of the stairs?
Liam: Vax is scooching Scanlan out of the way to take that position right there.
Taliesin: The bear is at the back cell.
Laura: Scanlan, where are you?
Sam: There's voices coming from the stairs?
Liam: Yeah, someone's coming.
Sam: But there's a bear in the stairs.
Laura: Well, Trinket's coming down.
Marisha: I call, "Trinket, Trinket, Trinket (kissing SFX) Trinket!"
Matt: Trinket barely hears you from way over at the side.
Marisha: (kissing SFX) Come on.
Matt: He's coming into this room. Clarota just steps back, along the side of the stairs and out of view. A few moments pass as the footsteps slowly trail off.
Orion: I leave and turn around where Vex and Vax are.
Marisha: I know.
Laura: What's in the other door?
Matt: The other door is currently locked from what you can tell.
Liam: One moment. It is now not locked, I think.
Matt: (chuckles)
Liam: 25?
Matt: (clicking SFX) You push the door open and you see immediately, the fast moving heft of some large blade towards your head.
Sam: Oh, snap!
Laura: Oh, it's Kima.
Liam: No, it's a trap ready to hit me.
Matt: That is 24 versus armor class.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: That hits, all right.
Laura: Oh, you didn't check for traps.
Liam: Didn't check for traps.
Travis: I thought you were good at this shit.
Liam: I'm going to use uncanny dodge.
Matt: What would have been 20 points of slashing damage is reduced to 10. So you take 10 damage as the axe (impact SFX) hits you and imbeds itself in the wooden door, pulls back. Now you see as a duergar wearing this nasty-looking black leather tunic with a hood pulled back, with a giant, gnarled, hefted greataxe, words escaped me on that one, has a bunch of scars on its face. As it's grinning, it pulls the axe out of the doorway.
Liam: Right, I spit on the ground, and yank my belt off and throw it at his head.
Laura: And I yell ‘hold.’
Matt: Okay. As you throw the belt--
Sam: Hold?
Laura: Yeah, tell him to stop attacking.
Liam: Yeah, serpent.
Matt: --he ducks out of the way, pulls back out of the way, as the snake forms itself. It goes ahead and makes its attack. Go ahead and roll for snake attack against him.
Sam: Snake attack!
Liam: Okay, 12 plus, I don't know what, 12. Is my attack, his attack, snake attack?
Matt: Did you roll a 12 on that?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, that will not hit unfortunately.
Liam: All right.
Matt: As he slaps it off himself and it (swish SFX) cascades off to the side of the room.
Ashley: Is he in a cell?
Travis: Is a base attack a straight line from him to Vax to--
Sam: He's protecting the cells.
Ashley: He's protecting the cells.
Matt: At which point he kicks the door closed again.
Travis: Can I, in my rage, bullrush through this?
Sam: Yes, yes.
Matt: Now roll initiative, guys.
Orion: As he's going I immediately cast Stone Skin on myself. (cracking SFX)
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What I like is that there are 8 of us and 1 of him.
Laura: Possibly, if no one else is behind that door.
Taliesin: So far.
Laura: He's in a room by himself.
Liam: I can see the square, it's very small.
Matt: You've looked inside, seeing a brief bit of the room. 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 26.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 26, all right Percy.
Liam: (shooting SFX)
Matt: All right. 20 to 15?
Marisha: 18.
Laura: 15.
Orion: 19.
Matt: 15 to 10?
Travis: 14.
Matt: 14. 10 to 5?
Ashley: 7.
Matt: 5 to 1?
Sam: (nervously) 4.
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up first.
Taliesin: Where am I?
Matt: You are way back in this cell, and you hear a slam of broken wood and another slam of a door closing.
Taliesin: I'm going to run to the hall.
Matt: Make an acrobatics check to try and move through this cluster of people here.
Taliesin: I can do that. 24.
Matt: 24. You leap over, vaulting off of Trinket, land and move into this hallway. And that's the extent of your movement.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to try and take a shot and blow the lock.
Matt: Okay, with the Bad News or with your--?
Taliesin: Oh no, Bad News is away. This is just with the handheld, shooting at the lock at the door.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: Jesus H, 30.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: 9 points of damage.
Matt: 9 points of damage. As the door slams back and you prepare yourself to try and kick it open, you hear the familiar (zoom SFX) of one of Percy's pepperbox bullets as the actual handle of the door (impact SFX) gets blown off and there's a small hole in the wooden door now where its handle once was. The door swings open a little bit loosely due to the impact. That ends your turn.
Taliesin: That ends my turn.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay. All I'm gonna do is grab the hole of the door and yank it open and yell, "Your turn, Grog!"
Marisha: Oh! That's fun!
Matt: As you pull it open, the dwarf backs up over what you can see now, this room is completely covered in a series of really nasty, hooked instruments. Hot irons, you can see large pincers--
Travis: (laughs excitedly)
Matt: --you can see various blades.
Ashley: Oh, it's like a torture chamber?
Matt: It's a torture chamber. (all groan)
Travis: It's Christmas!
Taliesin: Grog is running into Toys R Us. This is going to be great.
Matt: You see gently as he backs away there is someone on this rack-like table. The dwarf backs up with his axe getting ready.
Liam: I use my bonus action to say, "You are so fucked, dwarf." (all laugh)
Matt: All right, that brings us to Tiberius.
Orion: I like where this is going, Vax. Wait, I go over there first and then I say that. (all laugh)
Matt: Acrobatics check.
Orion: Acrobatics, why?
Sam: You gotta jump over people.
Matt: You've got to move through people. The area is congested. Small spaces, man. Downside of a big party.
Orion: Okay. 22.
Matt: 22. You manage to move through, push the bear out of the way. Move, Trinket. Get out the way!
Orion: (muttering) Bear!
Matt: You manage to make your way, squeeze past Percy.
Orion: The bear surprisingly smells really nice.
Matt: All right, Tiberius, what do you want to do now?
Orion: I'm going to follow suit as I see what Vax is doing. I'm going to cast Hold Person on the dwarf.
Matt: You don't have visual on the dwarf currently, the dwarf is back--
Orion: What? That's absurd!
Matt: As you run through the hallway - which you don't know there's a dwarf there - you rush out to the hallway after hearing all this commotion. You look in and there's an open door into a room that's currently vacant. You don't have enough movement to get close enough, unfortunately.
Orion: Oh well, poop. I... I encourage violence. (all laugh)
Matt: A wondrous use of an action.
Orion: Do it! Do it, Grog! Destroy them! With no regard to any of his existence.
Matt: Keyleth.
Travis: (laughing) I encourage violence!
Liam: That's the best line of the night! (laughs)
Matt: You are currently in a cell with a dead body draped over you. (all laughing)
Marisha: It's cozy down here. Okay, so with the dead body, I hear what's going on - we're roleplaying it up!
Orion: Get the body off of you.
Marisha: I morph into Minxy form.
Travis: Minxy!
Marisha: And as I morph into Minxy form, I take the dead body that's on top of me and just pick it up with my mouth.
Matt: In your mouth, the body stirs. It wasn't quite dead.
Marisha: Oh, why?!
Laura: (Gasps) Oh, Keyleth!
Marisha: It was supposed to be - I wanted the dead one.
Travis: Minxy says I'm sorry!
Marisha: Can I drop that one and find a dead one?
Matt: Well, you wanted a dead one. It is now.
All: Oh!
Marisha: That's fine, that's fine.
Liam: Oh, murdering children again.
Taliesin: Spend the entire game being the worst person in the world.
Marisha: I know! I try so hard, you guys!
Travis: Was it a child duergar?
Marisha: I try so hard, I'm still the fucking worst!
Matt: So, you now have a dead, gaunt dwarf, hanging from Minxy's mouth. (all laugh)
Matt: What do you want to do?
Sam: Keep chewing.
Marisha: Um, it was...
Travis: Oh, go ahead, do something else.
Taliesin: At least it's not gamey, it’s fresh.
Marisha: Keyleth tries. Keyleth tries so hard.
Orion: You're not trying hard enough, damn it!
Marisha: Fuck you man, all right? I'm having a tough day.
Travis: You hear a little dwarf in the corner go "Mommy?"
Marisha: Vex brought up the fact that I killed a kid. I’m having all these memories coming back, I'm on the brink.
Matt: Yeah, there's some PTSD coming through.
Marisha: So I've got this now-dead corpse in my mouth and I come out around the corner.
Matt: Make an Acrobatics check. Because you’re still moving through this clustered hallway with a dead dwarf in your mouth.
Liam: Holy cow!
Marisha: I'm a tiger so--
Liam: That was Greyspine's cousin.
Marisha: Can I have an advantage? Oh, I rolled a 15. Plus being a tiger?
Matt: You're fine. You manage to push through, you're leaping through.
Marisha: I'm pouncy. And I come out into the hallway.
Matt: You actually shift Tiberius out of the way. This is a very small space, you're a very big cat. You're really pushing for space here.
Marisha: Move!
Matt: It's very, very tight quarters for you, you're like - (struggling SFX)
Orion: Keyleth, as a cat, you smell less good as Trinket does.
Marisha: It's not me, it's the dead body.
Orion: Oh. That's disgusting.
Marisha: And I look at the dwarf.
Matt: You can't see him from your vantage point, he's actually back out of sight.
Orion: I can't see him, you can't see him.
Marisha: No? Can I shift to see him at all?
Matt: You don't know there's a dwarf there. You just know there's some sort of commotion going on. You move around the corner and you see just an empty room.
Liam: Everybody give up your turn to Grog.
Laura: I know, let him go in the room.
Orion: Just let Grog deal with this butthole.
Marisha: I look at Grog and I foam at the mouth a little bit with the corpse and I--
Sam: Encourage violence.
Marisha: --I encourage violence. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. Vex?
Marisha: Just gnawing on the dead dwarf.
Laura: Oh, well, let's make this nice and easy. I smack Grog on the ass and say, "Go get him".
Travis: (eager snarling)
Matt: All right, Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: (eager snarling continues)
Marisha: Does he get advantage because we're all encouraging violence?
Orion: Yeah, or inspiration?
Matt: Oh no, you get inspiration dice for this whole set up. 1d8 inspiration dice.
Sam: You don't kill him in one shot, it's very very disappointing.
Matt: All right, you run in.
Travis: You said the room was full of shiny pointy things on the wall, right?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: I would like to bull rush the dwarf up and against the wall, try and spear him with all the sharp shit on the wall.
Matt: Okay!
All: (cheering)
Matt: Oh, that's nasty. Okay then, so for the-- (laughs)
Liam: Instant karma's going to get you, man.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: You hear that, Keyleth?
Marisha: (growling)
Travis: 24.
Matt: Yeah, against his 7. You rush in and with your first attack, you grab him, lift him, and you can see there's a series of giant meat hooks hanging from the back of the wall, and you just lift him up and (impaling SFX) shove him down onto the hook which protrudes from the front of his chest. (gurgling SFX)
Travis: No, perfect. Tell me I get another attack.
Matt: You do.
Travis: Excellent!
Matt: That's 12 points of damage and he's currently restrained by the hook through his chest.
Laura: Impaled? Oh!
Travis: Perfect! With my second attack as he's screaming out I reach inside, grab his lower jaw and pull him straight down.
Matt: Okay, make an attack roll.
Laura: Oh no! That's so gross.
Ashley: Oh, I love this so much.
Liam: Vax is using his free hand to cover his eyes.
Sam: Keyleth starts eating him.
Travis: (laughing) 24.
Matt: (laughs) Go ahead and roll damage on this.
Laura: Oh, sick.
Travis: With a 12?
Matt: For flavor, roll a 12. Why not? You're pulling his jaw.
Travis: Excellent! (laughing)
Ashley: He rolled really high.
Travis: 15.
Matt: After you throw him onto the hook, his axe clatters to the ground and he reaches up with his hands to grab you and it looks like he's pulling back to try and bring you in for a headbutt. This angry look of burning rage in his white eyes, this fucked-up duergar with all these scars on his face, as he reaches up towards you, you take your giant hand and jam it into his maw. With this horrible (choking SFX) sound, as you put all your muscle into it, glaring him in the face with a terrible grin you (breaking SFX) and yank the jaw off from the bottom of his head.
All: (cheering)
Matt: A spatter of blood across the front of his mouth and his tongue dangling, he gives out this horrible (gagging scream) this gurgling scream as all the blood begins to pour up into his throat. With that, clutching the jaw with one hand, you begin to pummel him in the face over and over, with his jaw, as he's watching, his head slowly cave in.
Travis: (laughing) Yes!
Sam: I think he's going to make it.
Matt: Until eventually, he's no longer moving and you throw the jaw to the ground, just coated with blood.
Liam: You're going to pull through, buddy.
Laura: Pike! I think Grog, um, I think he did his job.
Ashley: I scream out, "Good job Grog! That's your best one yet!"
Marisha: And they say video games are violent. (all laugh)
Laura: (gagging sounds)
Matt: As you've entered the room now--
Ashley: Wait, is he dead? (all laugh)
Matt: Oh, he's very dead.
Travis: We made cheese of him.
Matt: He lies there limply on the wall, twitching every few seconds. Grog, still in a rage, you look over at the other individual. You can see now strapped to this wooden frame is a smallish humanoid, female, currently chained and being pulled on a rack. You can see bunch of scars and wounds, blood pouring from each one of them.
Sam: Is that our girl?
Laura: That's our girl!
Taliesin: I'm running in. Do I know how to disable the rack?
Matt: You can probably figure it out with a tinker.
Liam: Pike!
Travis: Is it chains or rope?
Laura: Come heal her!
Liam: We need Pike in here!
Travis: Is it chains or rope?
Sam: I'll go!
Matt: It's chains holding her on.
Taliesin: I'm going to undo it.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Wait. Do we know it's her?
Matt: Go ahead and make a tinker check.
Laura: It's her. It's gotta be her.
Orion: Whoever it is, we should help.
Taliesin: What do I add? Is it proficiency bonus?
Matt: Proficiency bonus.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: 12? You take a moment and you manage to find where the winch to this machine is, where you can go ahead and release the tension and eventually the chains go a little more slack and (gasps) the halfling woman takes a deep breath and looks about the room a second, looks like there's a bit of a haze, but through the haze there's this constant anger and she looks down and goes: "So? Are you gonna let me go? Come on! Release these chains!"
Ashley: Who is she?
Travis: Wait, wait. Find out who she is first.
Laura: Can we insight and make sure that it's really who she--
Matt: You can indeed. This is an insight check.
Laura: Great, I don't get any... Anybody else want to roll for insight?
Liam: 5, 1. Pike, roll well. The twins fucked it.
Ashley: Insight?
Liam: Scanlan! Come up here!
Sam: Yeah, yeah, oh.
Ashley: 15! 15?
Liam: She's not in her right mind.
Matt: It's a very small room, only a few people can make it in here.
Sam: I'm gonna take a peek at her. What do I do? What do I roll?
Liam: Insight to see if she's in her right mind.
Ashley: 15? 18 is better.
Matt: At this point, it's pretty apparent that whatever this woman is, she's been here a while and has been subjected to many, many horrible things and still has that spark of life to her, mainly out of vengeance, anger, and pain, but she does not seem to be overtly aggressive or trying to deceive you; just trying to get out of these fucking chains.
Laura: Well, let's let her go.
Orion: I'll do an Arcana check on her.
Matt: What's that? Arcana check? To...?
Orion: See if there's like any kind of magical impurities in her.
Travis: If she's under the Imperius Curse.
Matt: Best you can tell, there's none.
Liam: I'm pulling out my lockpicks and I'm going to start working on--
Sam: I'm going to heal her with a little bit of a song.
Liam: And you know my lockpick snaps so... just totally broken.
Ashley: How hurt is she?
Sam: If I may.
Matt: She's pretty rough. As you look up, she's not clothed. Her body is just a spray of scars and gashes and rake marks. She's been tortured to an extent you hadn't seen in person, and to still be tensing her muscles against the chains and looking at you with this intensity, if this is indeed Lady Kima, you now see why she's made the reputation she has.
Liam: Grog, the locking mechanism on this is jammed.
Sam: Okay. So, I step forward and I pull out my flute and I sing, (singing) "As long as I got my song and flute, I'm gonna give some healing to you. Love and magic in the air tonight, gonna give you some hit points. Gonna give you some hit points, gonna give you some hit points of our love." (all laugh)
Sam: Dadadanana, okay. I roll 9 hit points.
Matt: The fresher wounds seal up, the blood flow comes to a stop. You see her muscles tense for a moment - her tension in her muscles relax for a minute. She looks to you for a second and says, "It's been a while since I've heard a song. Thank you."
Sam: It was a slow jam.
Taliesin: Please be careful for a moment. Can someone cover her ears for just a second?
Travis: Yeah, I got it.
Ashley: Earmuffs.
Taliesin: I'm going to utility shot - I'm going to put my gun against the lock, somewhere where it will not harm her and just blow it.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage. You don't have to roll to hit, it's right there.
Taliesin: 15. Is it two locks?
Matt: Well, there's one chain for the legs, one chain for the arms.
Taliesin: Okay. 15 for the leg. 10 for the arm.
Matt: (gunshot sound) The legs get free. (gunshot sound) The chain mostly snaps on the top part, but not quite enough. It's enough for you, Grog, to-
Travis: I got it! (snarling)
Matt: You reach over and bring it down, with a brief moment of extreme tension as the whole room watches Grog walk up with his axe and swing it down towards this halfling. Before you have a moment to stop, everyone's heart skips a beat. The chain is bisected--
Liam: Ease down! Ease down.
Matt: --at which point the halfling woman immediately jumps to her feet with almost like a kip-up stand and is now standing on top of the table. Her arms are still bound and she - (groans) You can now see where the metal was weakened from the axe blow. She (metal snapping SFX) pulls herself free from the metal binding--
Travis: That's hot.
Matt: --there's a blister across her wrist, from how long she's been pulling against these restraints. But she bore through it, with a little bit of blood that trickles from that wound. She has freed herself and she looks around the rest of the group. "So, I take it you're not from around here?"
Orion: No! Would you like some water?
Matt: She grabs it from you, pulls off the cork and just starts chugging like she hasn't had anything to drink in a long time.
Laura: Lady Kima, we need to get you out of here.
Liam: Allura has sent us.
Matt: She caps it off after a moment and takes a deep breath. "I'd hoped she would. It was foolish of me to come down here so unprepared. Just knew there wasn't much time." (chuckles)
Liam: Time 'til what?
Matt: She looks around and says, "Look, we don't- it's a story. I have no--" And she kind of points to her pretty much unclothed, unarmored form, and says, "I need to find my implements. We need to get out of here."
Travis: Could I offer to you this black, studded leather, dwarven armor? It's not leather, actually.
Liam: It's magical, it'll fit you.
Orion: Would you care for this robe?
Laura: Which sounds better?
Matt: What armor were you offering her?
Travis: It's the black, dwarven armor--
Liam: The armor that I found and gave to Grog. It's magical.
Matt: Oh, the studded leather.
Liam: Yes.
Travis: It's in the bag.
Matt: She goes, "Sure, it works for now." She takes it from you and starts putting it on. You see her wincing as she puts it on, as it covers some of the wounds. Her whole body is just sore, but she still pushes through it.
Ashley: I'm going to heal her a little bit more.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I'll put my hands on her. I'm sorry. You're not fully healed, let me help you out.
Travis: (quietly) Grog likes scars.
Matt: As you do, she takes a moment and she says - You heal her and she goes, "Can I-" She sees your mace and goes, "Can I borrow that for a second?"
Ashley: Uh...
Matt: "Please?"
Ashley: My mace?
Matt: "Your mace, please."
Ashley: What do you need it for? (all laugh)
Travis: You can have mine.
Matt: "Do you trust me?"
Ashley: I don't know. This is all I have to protect myself.
Matt: "You've come this far."
Orion: Grog has something for you.
Sam: Say yes to life, Pike.
Ashley: All right, well, I also have a morningstar, but this is-- (all laugh)
Ashley: Are you gonna give it back?
Matt: As you hand it out, she grabs it from your hands--
Ashley: That was rude.
Matt: --walks to the edge of the table--
Ashley: I don't like her.
Matt: --stares at the dwarf that is currently hooked onto the wall. (angry yell) And with a yell, slams it right into his face, causing his head to explode against the back of the wall. Slams it again and again and again, and is just making hamburger of his entire body. The arm sloughs off and she's just going nuts. You can see her bludgeoning over and over again with a spray of gore on her. And there's this look of anger, frustration--
Laura: She's raging.
Matt: --and a sick sense of joy a little bit in her eyes in how she's just tearing this dwarf apart. Eventually, after this frenzy, you're all taken aback, and she takes a moment. (heavy breathing) There is very little left recognizable of what once was a duergar.
Sam: I notice a bulge in Grog's pants. (all laugh)
Orion: I use my Mage Hand to slowly pick up my bottle of water... (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. She takes the mace she borrowed from you. (splatter sound)
Ashley: I'm sorry I questioned you.
Matt: As she begins to hand it back to you, there's a slight flash of radiant energy that emanates from her hand, and it burns all of the blood that currently encapsulates the mace off, and hands it back to you. "Thank you. I needed that."
Ashley: You're very welcome. I'm sorry I questioned you.
Orion: Give her something, Grog! Let her use one of your things!
Travis: That was amazing. (all laugh)
Orion: Like, you know, give her one of your things, Grog.
Travis: Could I, um, would you like to touch my axe? (all laugh)
Matt: "If you want to part with it, certainly."
Travis: Oh, uh. (clears throat, sniffs) Maybe we should get out of here. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Why don't we collect your things?
Laura: Yeah, where are they? Do you know?
Taliesin: I would assume they're being stored upstairs.
Matt: "I have no idea. They're either in the vault or they're in the armory."
Sam: Vault or the armory? Those are places that we can go?
Laura: There's a vault?
Taliesin: Are there stairs in the room that we're in?
Matt: "As far as I can tell, my--"
Liam: Lady Kima, are these things absolutely necessary? We have a secret entrance to this place. We could leave now. Are they of vital importance, the things you've lost?
Matt: She thinks to herself for a second, and goes, "They are divine implements, gifted to me from an avatar of Bahamut directly. I feel, to leave them behind would be a partial failure to my quest. Not to mention, that what we may face beyond this, we'll need every bit of help we can get."
Travis: Oh, shit.
Liam: Well, that's that then.
Orion: You'll have a friend in us, that's for sure.
Laura: Let's find the frigging vault!
Taliesin: Let's go upstairs.
Liam: Let's go to the vault! Let's go upstairs.
Matt: As you show the back of that card, she gives you a look and smiles and says, "Ah. It's good to see that your scale of color does not belie your intent. That is a face I've not seen for some time. I thank you." She leaps off the table. "So." (sighs) "Shall we?"
Sam: Do you know where the vault is?
Matt: "I can show you."
Laura: (whispering) Yes!
Sam: Lead the way!
Marisha: I go up to her, still in my Minxy form, and I rub on her legs.
Taliesin: Have you dropped the body yet?
Travis: I get right up behind them too, competing for space.
Taliesin: Are you dragging a dead body around?
Marisha: No, I dropped the body. While she was talking, I took the body, and I drug it back, and I buried my shame. (all laugh)
Marisha: So, first, I buried my shame.
Matt: Your shame has been sufficiently buried. (laughter continues)
Orion: Hashtag bury your shame.
Marisha: And I purr.
Matt: She doesn't look at you, but she pats you absentmindedly as she passes you, her direct intent on heading back up those stairs herself.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves?
Laura: Yes, let's let all the other dwarves out, and maybe give them some food to try to help them out, if we can.
Travis: In the meantime, I have a greatsword or a morningstar mace that you can have until we find your items.
Matt: "Greatsword."
Travis: Greatsword it is.
Matt: She takes it from you, and the sword is a little over a foot taller than she is. Maybe a little more than that.
Laura: She's really fricking buff.
Matt: But as you hand it to her, she still takes it, and you can see--
Liam: She's a ripped halfling.
Laura: That's pretty badass.
Matt: --she is a built halfling female. She has seen some war, and she has survived some shit.
Liam: She's the Tyler Durden of halflings. (all laugh)
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Travis: As I see her grab the sword, I ask, "Would you care for some ale?" (all laugh)
Matt: She glances over her shoulder at you, and says, "Later. We have nothing to celebrate for yet."
Travis: Absolutely. Plenty of time! (all laugh)
Liam: I think Grog is smitten!
Laura: She comes to your knee.
Liam: Oh my goodness!
Laura: Can I run in the little prison, and tell the dwarves, if they are conscious, to say, "Don't exit from where you came. There's a secret entrance up and in a store room. Go that way, and stealth out."
Matt: One of the ones that was semi-conscious--
Laura: All of that, I say all of it.
Matt: He sits up and looks at-- (laughs) That's fucked up. Sits up and looks back at you and - (ragged breathing) "Thank ye. Thank ye kindly."
Laura: Here's some cheese! (all laugh)
Matt: He takes it hungrily through the bars and just starts eating it, incessantly, as you leave.
Taliesin: Government cheese.
Liam: Is provolone all you've got?
Matt: Lady Kima's already up the stairs.
Laura: It's Velveeta.
Matt: (disgusted groan) Velveeta!
Sam: We're following up the stairs.
Marisha: (laughs) It's calories!
Matt: All right. Clean this off here.
Laura: Oh goodness, oh goodness!
Taliesin: It's going to be fun! Savage burning--
Travis: I'm right with Minxy, competing for first place.
Liam: I place a hand on Lady Kima’s shoulder--
Marisha: First place, for how fucked-up we are.
Travis: Perfection! (laughs)
Marisha: Perfection! (laughs)
Liam: --place a hand on Kima's shoulder and say, "Please, allow me," and move several feet ahead of her and start sneaking along.
Matt: As you move up to her, you notice she's standing at the bottom of the stairs with a tension, staring up at the top of the stairway, where Clarota is looking down at her--
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: --and backing away, and she goes--
Orion: Oh! Yes. Uh--
Laura: Wait- Wait!
Matt: "Who is this filthy--"
Taliesin: No no no no!
Marisha: (screams)
Orion: I put my Mage Hand in front of her. Wait, wa-wait! Hold on! It- it's fine! Er, this mind flayer is with us! We saved him, or he- he's our ally now; he's fine. No one needs to fight. He, uh, she's fine, he's fine. His name is Clarota.
Taliesin: He's been an enormous help.
Matt: Without taking her eyes off of Clarota--
Orion: This is Kiva-
Sam: Kima.
Orion: Kima.
Matt: She looks back over - (laughs)
Orion: We are allies, all, yes?
Matt: "Are you to tell me that you've come down here and allied yourself with an entity that is the anathema of the Mountain?"
Orion: Yes!
Travis: Uh, what was that word?
Liam: I'm right at her shoulder, so I say, "We understand he's dangerous, but he's gotten us this far."
Matt: "And for what purpose? You think they don't have plots lined out for weeks and months--"
Orion: No, no, no! Listen, listen-
Matt: "--there is no trust to be had with these creatures."
Liam: He has been shit out by these creatures. They do not want him or trust him. He is an outcast. And we are working together, in this moment, and without him we would not have gotten here.
Laura: We see a single tear drop from Clarota's eye.
Matt: "And with him you will never get out."
Orion: No! We have his, er, alliance. There's a greater entity controlling his people, which he has been outcast from, like Vax was saying!
Matt: "And have you not thought for a second that perhaps all of you are being manipulated by this creature?"
Ashley: Well, I have.
Matt: You can see the greatsword now flares with divine energy and she goes, "I will not stand here and let us ally ourselves with this filth!"
Orion: (shouting) "Lady Kima!" And I blow fire breath. And I use Control Flames to create a bunch of swords around me with fire.
Laura: Don't threaten Kima! She's better.
Orion: (harshly) I give you my word.
Matt: Her attention divided from Clarota, now tends towards you.
Orion: Don't act me a fool, and don't treat me like one either! None of us are half-wits as you are claiming. We would not be fooled by such a creature like this. The words he speaks are true. And we believe him.
Matt: You go ahead and make a diplomacy check. Or a persuasion. Persuasion check.
Laura: Oh god!
Liam: Get it on, Tiberius!
Travis: Do it.
Liam: Get. It. On.
Orion: That's terrible.
Liam: Oh. Get it off?
Sam: Not good.
Laura: Not good?
Sam: Not good!
Orion: 12.
Matt: 12. Okay. She walks towards you, and with each step, you can see the color of her eyes begins to vanish, giving way to an extremely bright, burning, silver light. And she says--
Laura: (whispering) Oh my god, she's so cool!
Matt: "Listen. You come with me. Without this creature! Or you continue with it, and without me."
Orion: Why you have to be like that?
Matt: "I will not walk beside this. I have had its people devour mine since I set foot in here. This creature, whatever its reasoning is, is not in your best interest. It will lead you into a web of your own destruction! I've seen their kind work."
Liam: Clarota!
Orion: Yeah, they're mostly buttholes, but he's not a butthole! (all laugh)
Orion: I understand that -
Liam: Clarota!
Orion: - we had to kill a couple and he actually helped a lot!
Liam: Speak your mind! Convince her. Fix this.
Matt: Clarota, at the top of the stairs, you can see his tendrils in his mouth curl back in a sneer, his hands crossed before--
Orion: He won't even do anything!
Matt: --Clarota says, (gasping, breathy voice) "Listen. I am not going to walk where I am not welcome. I will not wake up with this--"
Liam: Giving us a Walking Dead decision.
Matt: "--woman's blade in my back! We made a deal."
Marisha: People with kids. You deal with this all the time.
Liam: I walk between them and put hands out.
Laura: Come on, roll a 20!
Liam: And say, "We all want the same thing. Kima. Tell us. What is it that you've come here for? What is your purpose here? Speak your mind, if you are true."
Matt: Kima turns back towards you, the same glowing flare in her eyes. "I've come here to rid this mountain and this continent of the darkness that resides deep within the bowels of this thing's city!"
Liam: Clarota, why have you come here. What is it you seek?
Matt: Clarota settles into itself for a second. "Ah, I've come to destroy this creature K'Varn and free my people."
Liam: Then the two of you. Get over your fucking shit. (all laugh)
Liam: We want the same thing here. Get over yourselves. Both of you. We share a common purpose. We are going to end this fucking bullshit. Kima, we have come here for you. Pay us the respect that we have earned. We have come a long way for you. He is an unlikely ally, but he has gotten us to this point. And together, for this moment and this moment only, we can work together. We don't have to be school chums or buddies in a week from now. But right now, right here, we will work together and achieve the same thing. What say you, Kima?
Matt: She looks towards you and says, "Free his people, he says. What do you think will happen once his people are free? Shall they let us walk out on our own?"
Orion: Yes! He said so! And then they'll be buttholes when we leave!
Matt: "You know so very little of these dark caverns, my dragon friend."
Orion: Yeah, it's our first time here!
Matt: "These entities I watched steal the very life essence of the men and women I hired and travelled with for weeks down here. I watched them capture them, and devour their very minds before me, and laugh and cackle as I fled into the shadows."
Laura: But they were under control of K'Varn at that point. Yeah!
Matt: "Oh! Understand; whether or not K'Varn controls them to give them direction, they are of that type of mindset at all points. They do not hope society will thrive. They do not want us free peoples to walk the surface. They want us for food."
Sam: Lady Kima, if I may. If you're intending us to choose between you, and our ally Clarota, and we can't get you to see eye to eye with us, then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but to choose our own friend Clarota over you.
Laura: (gasps) What?
Sam: We're giving you one last chance. Either you are with us, or you are against us. This is a threat.
Matt: "So you walk in here, save me from my binds, under the words of my dear, lifelong friend Arcanist Allura--"
Sam: We mean you no ill will. It is you who are aggravating the situation.
Liam: You could be sitting in a cell by yourself doing fuck-all, or ending this problem now.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Everyone's giving her inspirational talks.
Laura: I'm so nervous! Oh, Scanlan, come on!
Sam: Well, I rolled a 3...
Liam: I rolled a 13.
Sam: But I have a plus 13! So that's a 16.
Liam: Plus 13? 3 plus 13? Okay.
Ashley: Plus, plus, uh... hold on. (all laugh)
Ashley: Because, you didn't- where the fuck. (all laugh)
Ashley: War God's Blessing!
Matt: Cleric flail!
Ashley: No, I can't do that, because that's when a person makes an attack roll. (all laugh)
Ashley: Get 'em, Scanlan! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Can I assist?
Laura: He assisted because he was talking--
Matt: Unfortunately, it's too late. Once the roll--
Sam: No, he was with me, he was with me.
Laura: He assisted?
Matt: Right, right. And because of that, the DC has been considered. She takes a moment and steps forward. She's a few inches taller than you.
Sam: Of course she is! Everyone is! (all laugh)
Matt: And she looks at you, and says, "He of the pretty voice. I am grateful that all of you have come and traversed all this danger in my name, to free me from the binds that have held me. And I do wish, very much, to walk alongside you to this end. And I understand, it may be very well possible that this thing has taken your minds without your knowledge. However--" And her eyes close for a second, and she opens them again, and that radiant spark of silver fades, and her normal eye color returns. "We see ourselves with little choices. And I have very little allies at this point to achieve my goal."
Laura: (whispering) Oh, thank god.
Matt: "If we are to travel together, this one must walk in step the entire time. One single misstep, and I will not hesitate to carve that head from your body in the name of Bahamut."
Orion: I'm sorry. Do you mean like dancing?
Travis: I will help you do that if he missteps.
Matt: Clarota, hands still crossed, takes a step down the stairs towards her. Its tendrils in its mouth kind of-- (slurping SFX) (breathy voice) "And please, understand, if you ever intend to try and cut my life short, I will also not hesitate to bore that beautiful mind from your skull."
Liam: Once we murder this K'Varn, you guys are going to laugh so hard.
Laura: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Sam: So friends then?
Orion: Allies, allies.
Travis: Allies, allies.
Laura: Allies?
Taliesin: I suppose everybody understands everyone now.
Orion: Allies. Clarota likes allies.
Laura: Good times.
Liam: The enemy of my enemy...
Orion: Is...
Laura: Is my...
Sam: Has mind-sucking tentacles.
Matt: She looks back at the rest of you and gives you all an understanding look and a nod and she says, "I pray that you are right. I pray that you're honest and I pray that through some strange will of the gods, this entity is telling the truth. Because if it's not, none of us will make it out of here alive."
Liam: We're playing a game of chess here, Kima, and we will win.
Laura: I whisper in her ear "I would have chosen you."
Sam: And I start humming 'Kumbaya'. (all laughing)
Sam: Kumbaya, my lord. Kumbaya.
Orion: I take the dagger and make a happy face of fire.
Matt: She doesn't notice this, as she steps up the stairs towards Clarota.
Laura: Oh god. Okay.
Matt: Clarota steps back, hands up in front, this little spark of arcane energy forming in his hands. Clarota [sic], bringing the sword up in front of her, pushes Clarota aside and continues ascending back up the stairs to the first level. (offscreen thump)
Matt: --To the first level. (all laugh)
Orion: Killing two guards on the way.
Matt: Clarota puts the hands folded back together. (unimpressed huff) (breathy voice) "Shall we?" And walks up the stairs after her. And you all begin to ascend back onto the first floor and that’s where we’ll end the game for this evening. (Multiple groans and exclamations)
Marisha: What? No. What time is it? I thought we just got started?
Travis: I thought we were going to have to pick. We got like ten more minutes!
Marisha: Yeah, we have ten more minutes.
Sam: No, no, no. That's fine, that's fine.
Laura: No, yeah, that is a good place, or we're going to get in a battle.
Matt: (chuckles) Depending on where you guys are going next it could be a bit of a lengthy encounter, so...
Laura: Oh god.
Liam: So the building is empty.
Matt: It's totally empty.
Laura: Completely empty.
Liam: There's ghouls everywhere.
Matt: There’s nobody in there. No one has any idea that you're here.
Travis: Wait, show of hands, if we have to pick between one or the other, who's picking Kima?
Orion: Oh, Kima?
Travis: Who's picking turtle-face?
Liam: I don't know.
Orion: She's Allura's friend, right?
Travis: We're going to throw down, this is gonna be Marvel versus DC in this bitch.
Laura: She's Allura's friend, she's good!
Liam: Undecided, I don't know.
Laura: Would you pick Kima?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Okay, yeah.
Sam: You just want her because she's badass and you could hump her.
Travis: Yeah! (all laugh)
Matt: Oh, Grog.
Laura: That would be the most awkward humping ever.
Orion: That's a good idea. Grog! You can go hump, I can get Allura.
Liam: She can hump your leg.
Travis: Did you see her work in that room of blood?
Taliesin: Only one of them is demanding that I become a liar.
Marisha: Isn't Kima a dwarf?
Matt: No, Kima is a halfling.
Laura: Kima is a halfling.
Marisha: Halfling?
Liam: She's a ropy, muscular, halfling.
Ashley: Wait, dang it! I wanted to take some torture weapons!
Matt: You can go back if you want to.
Ashley: Yeah, can I go back since we have ten minutes and go get some torture weapons?
Liam: What's it for?! (all laugh)
Matt: This would be pretty quick, you have to grab some things as everyone is heading up the stairs.
Liam: Who's your deity? Harvey Keitel? (More laughing)
Ashley: No! Just for Grog!
Matt: So, Pike, the war priest, however, who the light of Sarenrae has guided her through her life, once a gifted being of light and joy, upon coming to the edge of death, her soul taken from her form and returned, going at sea and traveling with some of the more rough and tumble folks of the landscape, has returned now with her mind bent on war, vengeance--
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: --and what it means to win a battle, through force if necessary. Watching Pike rush off and going to gather up what appear to be two large, bladed hooks--
Ashley: (hissing)
Matt: .--a lengthy hand-razor--
Taliesin: Nice.
Ashley: Okay, wait, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor...
Marisha: You're going to go Sweeney Todd all up in this shit.
Laura: (mimicking Ashley) Hold on, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor. (More laughter)
Liam: A Milli Vanilli album, and...
Ashley: Wait, what was the first one?
Matt: Two large, pointed hooks that are about two feet in length. Almost like a bladed jai alai.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: And you gather a small bag of various instruments that are rusty and nasty.
Laura: Ew.
Matt: There is just some leather pouch and you put that in your bag. It's all you have time to grab before you have to bolt back up to get to the rest.
Taliesin: (swishing SFX)
Matt: And we'll pick up the next game as you guys head up the stairs back into the hallway you first entered in the center of the Emberhold duergar stronghold, Lady Kima released and a very tentative alliance. So, thank you guys all for watching.
Ashley: Whoo!
Marisha: Pain in the ass, Lady Kima. Pain in my ass.
Laura: Hey.
Zac: Oh hey.
Matt: Hello, Zac!
Zac: I was doing my little pop-ins here.
Matt: Yeah.
Zac: So we had some donations to the charity.
Matt: Oh, that's awesome!
Laura: Really?
Marisha: Yeah!
Marisha: Thanks guys.
Zac: I have really terrible handwriting, so... So I wrote these myself and I'm supposed to read them and...
Matt: Right, right, that's okay.
Zac: TheConman93.
Matt: Conman93, thank you!
Zac: ...Marilyn?
Matt: Marilyn, thank you!
Zac: A123Junior.
Matt: A123Junior, appreciate it, buddy.
Zac: Poltergeist123.
Matt: Poltergeist123, yeah. All good movies. First two.
Zac: Almsnuffufin... Um, Eon? Something?
Matt: Yeah MisnurMenfrishunsen.
Zac: AxisOfAnarchy...
Matt: Thank you. Nice, Axis.
Zac: RuzGofDi.
Matt: RuzGofDi! Thank you guys so much for donating! Really appreciate it.
Zac: Give to charity. Thank you.
Matt: Thank you, guys.
Zac: So thank you guys for tuning in tonight and for all you front page viewers. We stream 6 to 7 hours 5 to 6 days a week.

Zac: You guys are all welcome to stop by.
Matt: We might just do that. Awesome.
Zac: It's from 7 to 9 we'll have a band playing, we're gonna do some fun group games. Probably play some inappropriate Cards Against Humanity. And Super Fight and stuff like that.
Matt: As if there was appropriate Cards Against Humanity.
Zac: Every time I break it out, I'm like, I should never do this. (all laugh)
Matt: I know. It's part of the fun. And we're every Thursday, 7 o'clock, 7PM Pacific Standard Time. Usually we run about 2 and a half, 3 hours, our game sessions. So please come watch every Thursday. We love to have you guys.
Zac: And for Team Hooman tomorrow is Ify Appreciation Day. So if you guys want to get on that.

Bang!, stuff like that. He's a really talented dude. You should look him up before you write those tweets just so you know more of what he's about. And we are going to throw that dropcam up and set up for dancing. If any of you want to stay, you're welcome to. If not, you're welcome to leave. No one is going to force you, except chatroom now that I brought it up. (all laugh)
Ashley: I mean, it's a good workout after all this food.
Zac: You burn some calories after all that chicken, right?
Ashley: Burn some calories...
Laura: Right, right.
Matt: Exactly.
Zac: We are, I think, 20 away from a giveaway. So as long as we're live, the giveaway counts.
Travis: Is valid.
Matt: Exactly.
Zac: So, if you get 20 subs before we go offline we will ship this wherever you are in the world. So, let's throw the dropcam up!
Matt: Yeah guys, thank you so much! (kiss)

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone! And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. (cheering)
Matt: Indeed. Tonight, we are sadly down one Sam Riegel, because apparently he has priorities.
Laura: Where is he?
Matt: I actually don't know.
Liam: Watching his kids!
Laura: Is that where he's at?
Liam: I don't know where he is.
Laura: I don't know where he is.
Matt: That's weird. Well--
Marisha: Oh, man, I feel like he told us. (laughter)
Marisha: You know? I just don't remember where he is--
Laura: What is his mother's name!?
Marisha: What is his mother's name!?
Laura: It's Lenore! I know it. It's Scanlan's mom--
Marisha: You don't care about his past!
Taliesin: What am I doing Thursday night!? (laughter)
Travis: It's not that we don't remember, we just don't care.
Taliesin: (laughs) Yeah.
Matt: Well, Sam, wherever you are, you're not watching, so you'll never hear this anyway. (laughter)
Matt: But we love you.
Travis: It's true. That's hilarious because it's true.
Matt: Before we get into tonight's episode, let's get through a few announcements here. First and foremost, tonight we have the delight of being sponsored by our returning friends Puzzle Quest! (cheering)
Matt: Puzzle Quest, they're not pushing anything in particular, but we're wanting to talk about a bit how they're just-- their Marvel Puzzle Quest is awesome. I've been playing Puzzle Quest since it first came out. I remember spending many angry hours on Xbox Live, getting my ass kicked by people in Puzzle Quest when it first came there. But Taliesin, did you have anything you wanted to say?
Travis: It's a big anniversary for them.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's Puzzle Quest's ten-year anniversary.
Laura: Wow, really?
Taliesin: Yeah, and gosh, golly. Puzzle Quest. Marvel. Marvel Puzzle Quest. Marvel and Puzzle Quest.
Marisha: You're not Sam Riegel.
Taliesin: I'm not Sam Riegel!
Marisha: You're not Sam Riegel.
Taliesin: I'm doing my best! I was just given this! I thought he was going to be here! We brought his things out. I thought he was going to be here! And now I have this, and I have to somehow--
Travis: Can you just play on his harmonica, or something?
Taliesin: I'm not touching that. I know where it's been.
Liam: It's a hard truth that only one of us is irreplaceable.
Taliesin: That's so true.
Matt: This is true.
Laura: It's sad.
Taliesin: I can say that I do love comic books. I love three-jewel replacement games that I can play on airplanes--
Liam: And Marvel.
Taliesin: -- and when I wanna pretend to listen to my family over Christmas. It's great.
Marisha: You're killing it, man.
Taliesin: I know, and I suddenly realised a couple of them watch the show, and now they know that I'm not really texting you guys.
Liam: Taliesin pulls out a curly blonde wig and--
Matt: And starts jamming candy bars in his mouth.
Laura: Shaka, man, oh yeah. (laughter)
Taliesin: But, Marvel Puzzle Quest is great, because it's all the fun of the three-gem, Bejeweled-style games, but you would also collect characters if you're a big nerd like I am, and they've got basics like Thor and Iron Man, and new fun ones, like Ms. Marvel, and--
Laura: What about Black Widow? Do they have Black Widow?
Taliesin: They have Black Widow.
Laura: Hell yeah, they do.
Taliesin: Black Widow is actually one of the first ones I ever got, but they've also got crazy ones-- they've got Devil Dinosaur. That's nuts.
Matt: That's pretty intense, actually.
Marisha: It's pretty nuts.
Matt: Do they have Slapstick?
Taliesin: I'm even more embarrassed that I know you now. It was already bad. This is why you're never going to be on my show, Matt.
Matt: (cries) I know.
Taliesin: Ooh. You're never going to be on my show because you don't have time. I know. (laughter)
Matt: That's exactly why.
Taliesin: But yeah. Marvel Puzzle Quest. Thank you guys. You can get it on Steam, Amazon App Store, Google Play, Apple Store-- it's all over the place.
Laura: Yay, thanks, Marvel Puzzle Quest!
Liam: Next up!
Matt: We have any merch updates? Or are we just still kicking ass in the store?
Laura: (high-pitched) Hey, there's stuff in the store, you guys! You should go look in the store and see what is there.
Matt: Perfect. Thank you, Laura.
Laura: You're welcome.
Matt: That was adorable. We have Wondercon coming up! Which we're excited about. It's for you guys who are able to come to Wondercon, Anaheim, California, April 1st on Saturday, we're having our Talks Machina live panel from 2-3PM in the Arena, the big room there, and--
Travis: Come to Anaheim, 4,000 seats!
Marisha: Yeah, big seats!
Matt: Trying to fill the room.
Taliesin: Comfy seats.
Matt: Because if we manage to fill the room, we can use that as an example as to why we have good crowds, and we can hopefully do more events in more places in the country, or around the world! And see you guys in person.
Travis: We want to see everyone within a reasonable driving or flying distance.
Liam: Also, Taliesin and I are going to fistfight until one of us is dead or unconscious.
Marisha: I'm going to break a pool cue.
Taliesin: While drunk.
Matt: That's new. I didn't--
Laura: It's going to be epic.
Matt: Okay! So that's a thing.
Travis: Just roll with it.
Matt: See that-- yeah.
Liam: Got a lot of pent-up aggression, Tal.
Taliesin: I'm ready.
Matt: Perfect.
Taliesin: I want a bruise, right here.
Matt: April 1st.
Marisha: (laughs) I want a bruise.
Matt: 2PM at Wondercon, our panel, and--
Taliesin: Critical Brawl. We just barefist it.
Marisha: Man.
Matt: Speaking of Taliesin unconscious-- Wednesday Club!
Taliesin: Oh, god! That's right.
Travis: (laughs) Great one.
Taliesin: We had a great time this week talking about Swamp Thing and horror comics. Next week, we're going to be talking vaguely about DC Comics; everything from Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, the whole set of them and all the weirdness, and talking about 52, what it is, why people seemed weird about it and why people are coming back to read it now. Like a brief overlook on everything DC Comics. It's going to be fun.
Marisha: It was a weird time.
Taliesin: Yeah, it was a weird time. It's getting cooler now.
Marisha: I feel like when people talk about DC Comics, they just only vaguely talk about DC Comics these days.
Taliesin: We're gonna try and see how many euphemisms we can-- We're going to talk about it like, "I know you think this is a new dog, but it's really the same dog, he's just better now." Yeah, we're working on it.
Matt: And Signal Boost. Our good friend of the show, David Nett, actually, his episode just went up today. David Nett, who is an amazing dungeon master. You can actually see him on Round Table, the new show that just hopped up on Alpha. He's also our trainer, who's been kicking our ass in the gym.
Marisha: He's our personal trainer. We did a Hamilton work-out yesterday. Oh man, it was so cool.
Matt: Four sets of core sets.
Taliesin: Did you take your shots?
Marisha: Well, I rised up when doing squats.
Matt: And Peggy, not happy to be there. Perfect.
Marisha: And if you go to iTunes, you can get the Signal Boost ringtone for your phone and it's pretty great. Also, we have another surprise coming next week that I'm pretty stoked about, but you have to wait. No one probably cares. But I care.
Laura: I'm so excited!
Matt: I'm so excited! I'm so excited! I'm so scared! For those who don't know what that is, you're young. (laughter)
Travis: YouTube it!
Matt: All right. Also, today was the episode of CelebriD&D.
Laura: Oh yay!
Matt: There's a preview on YouTube and the full episode's on Alpha right now. Hopefully they'll bring it out down the road. With Joe Manganiello, who is legitimately an awesome guy. We got to know him pretty well through the process and he's a huge old-school RPG-- like, he GM'd GURPS and Rifts for years in the late 80s in a little comic shop. I would never have guessed. We nerded out extremely hard. He's one of my new favorite people.
Marisha: He's pretty cool.
Matt: So check it out. We had a good time.
Marisha: And he had a cool hat.
Matt: He had a cool hat and a fun character. And he got to play with a younger Keyleth and Percival in a one-shot that is technically Exandria-canon.
Marisha: I was much happier.
Taliesin: I was not.
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: You were. I was not.
Matt: And, of course, next Tuesday you can come and see some of us as well as our fantastic host, Brian Wayne Foster, on Talks Machina, Tuesday at 7PM, here on Twitch or Alpha. And don't forget to check that out. It will be about this episode. Now, lest I am mistaken, I think we're done. And that means it's time--
Taliesin: No!
Laura: No! No! Hey, look at this cool dice bag I have, it's got a bear!
Matt: -- to start tonight's episode of Critical Role.
Laura: Damn it. [opening credits]
Matt: Hello and welcome back, everybody. Nice one, Laura. Well done. So, bringing us into tonight's episode. Last we left off, Vox Machina, after completing their assault and destruction of the Chroma Conclave, they're tying up loose ends, various adventure hooks and dangers they'd left out in the open from earlier or during that whole adventure. After taking Keyleth to Vesrah to take her final trial of the Aramente, her long, many-year journey to prove her ability to lead her people, the Air Ashari, you returned to Zephra. Met her father, expressed that the trial was complete, and the ceremony took place in which Keyleth was given the mantle and officially titled as the Voice of the Tempest, the now-standing leader of the Air Ashari. Which, by the way, I'm supposed to give you this.
Marisha: What? Was that the thing?
Matt: That's the thing.
Laura: You get another thing?!
Marisha: I think this is my leadership thing. Yeah?
Matt: You have your leadership feat.
Laura: That's your mantle!
Matt: It's your mantle.
Marisha: I get another thing?!
Matt: It's nothing crazy. But it's fun.
Laura: Wait. Is it a cloak? Don't you already have a cloak on?
Taliesin: It's a mantle, it only goes to here.
Marisha: I gave that cloak to Kerr--
Liam: Rothfuss jacked that cloak.
Marisha: -- who wore it away.
Matt: (laughs) Rothfuss jacked that cloak.
Taliesin: I like to think there's a piece of paper like pinned to his wall right now.
Matt: He has the stats up there as a reminder? Framed? Please do that if you haven't already, Pat, please. So, after the ceremony is completed--
Marisha: What?!
Taliesin: Sorry, we're good. Carry on.
Travis: Perfect timing.
Liam: Rehearsal paid off. (laughter)
Taliesin: Don't feed them.
Matt: After the crowning, the ceremony coming to a close, the evening's celebration kicks off and as the setting sun begins to darken the sky, the people of Zephra are now bringing out foods and treats and cakes, and they're putting up ribbons of blue and white and gold on some of the nearby trees and doorways. And the folks of the Air Ashari tribe now are in the process of enjoying both the return of their people and the fact that there is now a clear head of leadership, and you guys are now surrounded, basking in the afterglow of the event as well as deciding with slow-rising tension what you have as the next step in your journey. So, what would you guys like to do?
Travis: Charge headlong into danger with no lessons having been learned from the previous sessions.
Marisha: Like it's day one. Vox Machina, let's do this!
Travis: Naked and running in full steam.
Liam: Like right now?
Travis: Yeah. No Vestiges, no nothing.
Liam: That would be the best end to that ceremony. Peace.
Marisha: It's our save game plus.
Laura: But can I go talk to Keyleth, actually? I did want to ask you--
Marisha: Yeah?
Laura: Are you allowed to leave? How does this work, exactly?
Marisha: I mean, I'm the chief. I can do whatever I want, right? I don't know, actually.
Laura: Should we talk to your dad?
Marisha: I should maybe talk to Dad.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: Yeah. I go talk to Dad. (laughter)
Matt: Okay. And wherever you walk now, because you have the mantle upon you and you have the cascading autumn-colored leaf cloak that flows behind you, it still seems very ceremonial in this jovial, party-based atmosphere. And as you move, you still can't help but notice that all eyes are on you at any given point in time. People seem generally excited that you've returned and that you've taken up this position. Eventually you make your way off where you can see there are a handful of the older, the more elder members of the Zephra tribe. They're around Korren currently, who notices you approach and shushes them all for a moment, turns to you, "Ah, Keyleth, my daughter. How can I help you?"
Marisha: Korren, I was wondering if I could have a word with you for a minute?
Matt: "Of course. You do realise that you can still call me father. I mean, I know you're the leader, but--"
Marisha: Can I? Is that allowed? I don't really know.
Matt: He puts his hand up and puts his arm around your shoulder and guides you off away from the chaos of the celebration. You hear the whistling of music and flutes and thin tanner drums going off in the distance. And as it fades the further off you guys walk in the direction of the tree where the ceremony took place-- (something falls in the background)
Matt: "Oh, sorry."
Marisha: You should fire that guy.
Matt: "I will."
Marisha: Shitty servants.
Matt: "It's very windy up here. Don't worry about it."
Marisha: Yes, that's true.
Matt: As you walk further away towards the tree, he takes his arm off from around your shoulder and says, "Now, I understand you have many questions and we've prepared you as much as we could leading up to this journey you've gone on, but now you're here."
Marisha: I guess.
Matt: "Primarily, the people of Zephra look to you for guidance when choices are hard, difficult."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "You are the acting head of law, like I've been all this time. If there is conflict, if there is difficulty, if there is a challenge that presents itself, that requires the wisdom of a leader to step in--"
Marisha: Right.
Matt: "That's when you're called upon."
Marisha: So, (sighs) I'm confused. Was the Aramente my training to be a leader? You apparently prepared me as best as you could before I left, I don't know how well you all did (sarcastic laugh). So I'm just wondering if I need to expect that again, is this just me figuring this out again? Or do I have guidance?
Matt: "The nature of the Aramente is fluid. I have not taken it as I am not the leader. It is tradition and it is both, as far as I understand, a series of challenges and lessons tailored to whatever a person seems to be seeking or what you can draw from that, but also to interface with the other tribes and establish that connection between all the leaderships."
Marisha: I did that (laughs). You're right, you haven't taken it, but that's been about 5% of my journey, all of the lessons that I've learned have been in the in-between.
Matt: "That is part of the Aramente itself."
Marisha: I know. I guess... I don't know. Just trying to figure out how to navigate this, like the leader I'm expected to be. You know, Dad, you didn't tell me a lot about the world and sometimes I think I get angry at you for that.
Matt: "You're not wrong to have these thoughts."
Marisha: Why didn't you tell me that the world could be so cruel and mean? Why did you never tell me that?
Matt: "We tried, but you can only tell someone so much. Do you not think we spent days warning you of the dangers and difficulty? We didn't thrust you out in the world with a smile, going 'have fun.' We told you it was challenging, we warned you of the people you might interface with that you couldn't trust. And for the first legs of it, we had a few scouts keeping an eye."
Marisha: What?
Matt: "Just to make sure you were safe."
Marisha: Okay. It just sounds like it was advice coming from people who didn't really fully know.
Matt: "To be fair, when every parent has a child come of age, you can only coddle them so far. Every bird has to be kicked out of the nest for it to learn to fly. Not because we want to, but because that's how things are."
Marisha: I know, and I thank you for that. I guess I'm just wondering what's next. Now what?
Matt: "Now, as leader of these people, you go and learn how best we can establish ourselves in this countryside. Where once we-- (sighs) Gwessar, or Tal'Dorei as the humans call it, all of our civilizations are merging. Isolation that we've relied upon is becoming less and less viable."
Marisha: I agree.
Matt: "And so part of, I think, what you have already begun, is finding a way to bring not just the Ashari, but Zephra as well, necessary friendships and allies."
Marisha: Our people need to be connected to the rest of the world that we've sworn to protect. I understand the need for our isolation but I often wonder if we had a few close allies on alert, if the Thordak incident might've have gone a little bit differently.
Matt: "I agree."
Marisha: I still need time, with Vox Machina. We still have things we need to complete. And then I promise I will return.
Matt: "All right. Come back. Do what you need to. You're not bound to this mountain. Just know that your heart is here, and we'll call for you if we need you. And when you're not needed beyond it, this is your home."
Marisha: Thanks, Dad.
Matt: "I'm proud of you." And his professional exterior falls away and he just steps forward and gives you a big, warm, fatherly embrace and just holds you there.
Marisha: Okay, Dad. Thank-- okay.
Matt: "Sorry." He rights his posture, shoulders back.
Marisha: I do the same. Adjust my mantle a bit. Another question. Do I have to wear this like all the time? It's a little unwieldy. It feels a little froufrou-y. Kind of ceremonial. It's just a little, feel like I'm going to trip on it.
Matt: "You know, do what you like. It's yours."
Marisha: Okay. 'Cause going upstairs in it, like in the heels, it's a little unwieldy. I mean, it's beautiful! I'm going to go get a drink.
Matt: "You probably should."
Marisha: Okay. Yeah.
Matt: "All right."
Liam: You read lips, what're they talking about?
Laura: Ah, they were talking all about you, actually.
Liam: I don't believe you.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Liam: Why would they be talking about me?
Laura: It's this whole conversation about you.
Liam: You are full of shit.
Laura: No, I heard she was saying how much she admired you, and he was saying, "Er. I don't think I feel it as much," and she was like, "No, really, Dad, you just need a chance to really talk to him," and he was like, "No, just believe me, I did talk to him, and I don't feel that way."
Liam: Yeah. Yeah, I'm--
Laura: And then she was like-- Never mind. (laughter)
Liam: I'm so glad I confide in you. I have you to lean on. You are the rock in my life. What would I do without you?
Laura: They actually said that, as well. They were talking about how amazing I am. (laughter)
Liam: While she's talking I start to walk away, quietly as possible.
Travis: I'm so happy right now.
Marisha: (laughs) So good.
Travis: Ah, deception.
Matt: So as the ceremony dies down, the evening comes to rest, the night sky takes over and you can still hear the gentle whistling of the winds through the various cracks and crevices in the mountainside. You are brought to your respective temporary abodes for the evening to rest, and to plan, and plot what you wish to do going forward. So, what do you want to do?
Liam: Well, figuratively or literally go to hell, I imagine.
Laura: Yeah, are we doing this? Tomorrow morning, we're heading out to hell.
Liam: Yeah, I mean, what're we going to--
Travis: First things first.
Laura: First things first what, Grog?
Travis: Right.
Liam: Squad leader. (laughter)
Travis: How do we get there?
Laura: Oh, she's got Plane Shift, right?
Marisha: I can get us there.
Taliesin: Very easily, actually. That's the easy part.
Travis: We don't take, like, a ship?
Taliesin: No, sadly we can't.
Laura: No ships.
Liam: No, but we don't know exactly where we're going to land, right?
Marisha: Correct.
Laura: Well, we know the city that we want to go to.
Marisha: I can get us somewhere within the City of Dis. I don't know if--
Laura: Dis city.
Marisha: Built Dis city!
Liam: Man. This is going to go great.
Marisha: It was too easy!
Liam: I mean, when we went to the City of Brass, we did not shift into the City of Brass. We dumped quite a ways away.
Marisha: It was, yeah. But on the outskirts.
Liam: Yeah. So we have no control over that, so--
Laura: We could pop into it. We could pop out of it.
Liam: Yeah. So, whatever plan we come up with, one branch of the future is complete bullshit improvisation for if we fall into the shit.
Travis: Right.
Liam: So there's no planning for that. So if we don't fall into the shit and we land somewhere relatively safe, what're we going to do? How're we going to play this? This is hell.
Taliesin: Well, it is complicated. And, as hells go, there could be worse hells. I've been reading.
Liam: Shocking.
Taliesin: Thank you. I've been looking into this, and it seems that where we're going has a very, very structured hierarchy. It's very ordered, the society makes sense, and wherever we find this creature that we have to slay, there will probably already be forces working against him that will be happy to ally with us to help that happen. They're vicious psychopathic creatures that only function because they maintain these rules with each other about how they're supposed to act.
Laura: It's very ordered.
Taliesin: I think it would be possible to find people who would be delighted for outsiders to come in and do their dirty work for them.
Laura: However, Scalebearer, big high guy. Really important guy said not to make a scene. He said if we make a scene, that would go poorly.
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Says him. Psh.
Liam: There's no point for sextuplets. We can't do that. That's not going to work.
Taliesin: No. They can see through things. It's going to be complicated as well because we have value as well.
Travis: Oh, I got it! We kidnap the president of hell and we assume his visage.
Liam: What's a president?
Taliesin: His name is Asmodeus. And no, we are not kidnapping Asmodeus of Hell.
Travis: Why?
Laura: I think he's probably kind of powerful.
Liam: He's really heavy.
Laura: Might be hard to lift him up.
Travis: Have you seen him?
Taliesin: I've seen sketches.
Laura: You have?
Taliesin: Yes. Well, I mean, I don't know how correct these are--
Laura: Morning! Morning has come!
Marisha: Oh, wow!
Taliesin: Oh, my.
Marisha: These are a power surge in there.
Liam: We talked all night and we squared it away and we're going to hell!
Matt: You talked all through the night. No rest was had. (laughter)
Marisha: It's very bright.
Taliesin: We're going to be offered things there. There's going to be deals made.
Liam: So we're talking negotiation or bullshitting our way. One or the other--
Taliesin: It's going to be negotiating, probably with someone who'll give us cover if we do some dirty work.
Laura: I mean, is it similar to the City of Brass? It sounds so similar.
Taliesin: They have a lot in common, yes. It's even more structured, though. There's quite a complex-- I alone have identified 13 different caste systems within their function.
Liam: Caste systems?
Taliesin: There's imps, spine devils, barbed devils, chain devils, bone devils. There's all these different kinds of devil, and each devil has to answer to a different devil. They answer specifically to the devils that have fealty over them, who in turn are at constant war with the devils who are in fealty to other devils, and archdevils, and greater devils, who in turn all owe their fealty to Asmodeus.
Laura: But we are not devils.
Taliesin: We are not devils.
Laura: Therefore, weak and liable to be taken as slaves.
Taliesin: We are not even slaves. We are consumables.
Marisha: I don't know. I feel like we've gotten a bit of a reputation for ourselves. I'm sure that word has spread. We're not, you know--
Matt: You would know this.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Percy, through your research. It's not terribly uncommon for mortals to wander through the City of Dis specifically because it is where goods, gold, and largely souls are traded to and from various structures or entities within the hells and beyond. To just consume or eat someone means nothing. The true worth of a soul is in corrupting it. And they do so through enticing, through corrupting their morals, through driving mortals through bargains and pacts to end up twisting into entities of order and evil as well, and then claim the soul of that. Contracts are a big thing.
Taliesin: And then turning that into a lemure. Yes.
Matt: Yeah, into a lemure, or other forms of soul-based energy. But contracts are a very, very important part of the whole economy.
Laura: So the person that we made a contract with was a devil that ended up being the one that killed Pike, right? That was a devil disguised as a demon?
Matt: Ah, no. That was a demon disguised as a devil.
Marisha: Yeah, that was super confusing.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Confusing?
Marisha: That was the one that we wished our way out of the contract.
Matt: Correct. Yes.
Marisha: Yeah, we don't really have that anymore.
Taliesin: I was very proud of that.
Laura: Yeah, we don't have a wish. Okay, so we make no deals when we go.
Marisha: No deals. No contracts.
Laura: No deals. No contracts. No shaking of hands. No signing of anything.
Taliesin: No accepting of gifts.
Travis: Feel like I'm going to forget this.
Taliesin: You are.
Marisha: Just don't touch anything.
Laura: Oh no. Don't touch anything.
Taliesin: Might have to make you special gloves that don't have any fingers.
Travis: I've got special gloves.
Taliesin: Even specialer gloves.
Marisha: Like a muff.
Laura: That we can wear over those gloves.
Travis: Like a what?
Marisha: Like a hand muff. (laughter)
Travis: You're going to make me a special hand muff? (laughter)
Matt: Taryon does pipe in, he's like--
Marisha: We could put little ears on, we can make it like a kitten!
Matt: "Oh, but I've such fine handwriting! If we need to sign anything, just let me know. I'm happy to."
Laura: No, Tary, no signing anything.
Marisha: Nope.
Matt: "I've signed a lot of contracts in my time. My father used--"
Laura: No signing of contracts.
Matt: "-- to do contracts throughout the countryside."
Laura: Although I'm sure you're good at reading contracts as well.
Matt: "This is true!"
Laura: Yes. You can read them, but don't sign them. How about that?
Matt: "How about if I read them and I like it?"
Laura: No. No signing. (laughter)
Laura: Unless you want to stay in hell.
Matt: "Agree to disagree."
Laura: And we come back here.
Taliesin: Your current contract with us actually stipulates that you can't have another contract enacted until you confer with all of us.
Marisha: Exclusivity.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: He goes through his bag and pulls out the contract. "I stand corrected."
Taliesin: I'm very thorough.
Laura: I don't even remember he signed a contract.
Matt: "Doty, write this down. Be more careful about exclusivity in future contracts." (laughter)
Taliesin: I don't think you were there. This might have been just him and me getting drunk at one point.
Travis: Is there any worth to only a few people, or one or two, going in to get a lay of the land, once we get there? Instead of just moving in our truffle-shuffle normal formation.
Laura: I feel like that could be very dangerous, for one person to go in alone.
Liam: Yes, I agree.
Travis: I'll do it.
Laura: Grog, no.
Liam: No.
Travis: I'm very stealthy.
Laura: Last time you were alone-ish, you almost killed two guards.
Travis: What is the problem with that?
Laura: In Vasselheim.
Travis: We got away with it, right? Did we get caught? Did we get caught, Tary?
Matt: "No! We did-- Did we get caught?"
Travis: No.
Matt: "I don't know. I still have-- I only remember half of what happened."
Travis: Tary is very excited about my plan. It's affecting his memory of what happened.
Laura: Right.
Matt: "I think I blocked it out. But what I remember was interesting."
Laura: You could always look in Doty's diary and find out exactly what happened.
Travis: Yeah, peruse the last 90 pages for the last hour.
Matt: Takes the book and starts thumbing through real fast. You look over at Doty who still has chunks and clusters of bits of red hair from the somewhat removed goatee.
Laura: Fu Manchu?
Matt: Yeah. His secret goatee.
Marisha: So, Percy. We know a lot of things and people move through the Nine Hells. What does it say about rakshasas in there? Where do they fall in the caste?
Taliesin: It doesn't actually say where rakshasas would fall in the caste, does it?
Matt: There wasn't a terrible lot of information. Not all the devils are in the same system. There is a promotion-demotion system in which devils advance and are demoted based on their elements there. But there are other fiends that exist in that space that aren't part of that system. Rakshasas are a little bit outside of that system. Succubi, incubi, they're a little bit outside of that system. There are other fiendish creatures that actually traverse between both the Abyss and the Hells based on what their interests are. So that's predominantly the structure of the devils that are--
Taliesin: In Dis?
Matt: Well, that are built within the Hells as their primary domain.
Liam: Percy, help me understand, since you've read so much about this.
Taliesin: Yes. Whole page. (laughter)
Liam: Good on you. So if the Raven Queen escorts souls-- If you're an absolute, terrible shit of a person and the Raven Queen escorts you over to the other side, we're going to be wandering amongst the souls of the damned? People who die go to where we're going?
Taliesin: If they're under contract, this is where they go.
Matt: And many who sometimes aren't under contract go there as well.
Laura: Oh really?
Matt: And you would know this, actually. The Raven Queen, as part of the laws of the cosmos that hold the various planes together, the Raven Queen does indeed escort good souls to the positive planes, the upper planes, and not-so-good souls to the lower ones.
Laura: Actually, I know that from reading a lot about the Raven Queen. I can answer that for you.
Travis: If you don't use a turn signal, if you have a vanity plate, you go to hell. (laughter)
Liam: Thank you. I know they get escorted to the other side. It just seems like an odd idea to be walking in a city full of the thrown-away. I'm talking to the air right now.
Taliesin: No, we're absolutely listening.
Laura: I'm sorry. Keep going.
Liam: It was the best thing you never heard. (laughter)
Taliesin: That changed the game forever.
Liam: I miss Scanlan Shorthalt so badly.
Marisha: Because he listened to you so much more?
Liam: No, he's just my buddy.
All: Aww.
Taliesin: Speaking of just our buddy--
Marisha: As we move on.
Taliesin: -- Pike is another concern. I would feel far more comfortable making sure that she is definitely on board for this.
Travis: Really?
Laura: Well, that's difficult.
Liam: Phone a friend? What do we do?
Taliesin: I don't know. I've been thinking about that, the best way to--
Liam: I mean, Hotis-- How long has it been, DM?
Matt: Since?
Liam: Since Pike wasted his sorry ass.
Matt: It's been, offhand, a couple of months.
Liam: A couple months. I mean, I don't think one more day is going to kill us, if we want to go get her. You know. (laughter)
Laura: That's difficult. (laughter)
Taliesin: I know, I do bring it up, though, that it is one those things that we should talk about.
Liam: I mean, if the fates allow.
Marisha: Yes. I feel like we would have to find someone to Send Message.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: There is a Message spell, maybe in the form of a text.
Matt: Just blackmail the writers of Blindspot.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah. (laughs)
Laura: Ashley is in New York. (laughs)
Taliesin: This is one of those things where I thought I would just bring it up now before we go running in there.
Liam: Oh, I was just trying to guilt Matt into playing Pike, but--
Taliesin: I am okay with that too.
Laura: No, it's Ashley's character, though.
Marisha: I mean we kind of did--
Travis: Pike, Tary, what else? (laughs)
Matt: Yeah, just throw all the NPCs at me. (laughing)
Liam: It's not the Thordak battle, there's not 87 miniatures on the board!
Laura: No, but I mean, it could be, we don't know.
Liam: All right, well, we're all going to die.
Marisha: We'd also have to see if Ashley would be down with us, you know--
Taliesin: I thought I would bring it up.
Marisha: -- Kaiju-ing Pike once again.
Taliesin: I just thought I would bring it up--
Matt: You guys could Jaeger her again.
Taliesin: -- 'cause it is one of those things that is pretty clutch down there.
Liam: Not prepared, but we never are.
Travis: Nope. So we kidnap the president. (laughter)
Laura: Definitely. I'm liking it more.
Marisha: So, I'm curious, if-- Rakshasas aren't necessarily part of the system, and this guy tends to come in and out and just make people's lives a living hell. (laughs) Hell! We're going! Puns!
Travis: Good. Slick.
Marisha: Then maybe no one would miss him. In fact, maybe people down there don't like him. You know?
Taliesin: The feeling I get reading-- the more I read about this place, is no one likes anybody down there, and so if we can figure out a way to be convenient about it, you can disappear anybody.
Liam: Also, didn't someone tell us that if they get trashed they are treated like shit there?
Taliesin: He's probably not well-respected.
Liam: We've trashed his ass twice.
Travis: When we went to the City of Brass we were owned, right? That's what let us move around so freely?
Taliesin: We don't have to do that here.
Laura: Are you sure-- okay.
Liam: (sighs) I mean, we thought it was getting us around but it clearly wasn't.
Travis: There's nothing that we need to think about like that so that we have--
Laura: So we should just go down, act like we're evils, like our souls have been claimed by another devil already.
Taliesin: Honestly, the more we act like us, the more people are going to try to tempt us into things.
Marisha: I could use Alter Self or try and change into something that's devil-y.
Laura: Can't they see through that?
Taliesin: They'll probably see through it.
Marisha: I have a question.
Matt: Yes?
Marisha: Because that is an interesting question, because--
Matt: Illusions are different than actually physically changing yourself.
Marisha: Right. It's transmutation--
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: Because Shapechange is considered a transmutation spell, whereas Seeming was an illusion spell.
Matt: Seeming was an illusion. Illusions and--
Travis: You actually become that thing.
Matt: As far as you know, the pit fiend you encountered is the only creature that saw through an illusion.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: However, illusions and transmutation spells, things that actually physically alter your form, that's not considered an illusion. You are actually changing your physicality, so Alter Self would not be something that a creature with Truesight could see through.
Marisha: Can I Alter Self to a succubus?
Matt: I mean, you could alter yourself to look more--
Marisha: To look like one.
Matt: -- like one. Maybe, yeah.
Marisha: Or like a tiefling?
Matt: I mean, you wouldn't be able to give yourself wings.
Marisha: Are tieflings a thing in the City of Dis?
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: Percy, are tieflings a thing in the City of Dis?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Matt: Ah, actually-- (laughter)
Taliesin: Would I know? It's not on the page. You gave me one page.
Liam: If you just think for a second.
Matt: I know, I know. Well, before I gave you a basic structure and I am filling in the gaps as we go.
Taliesin: Sure, thank you.
Matt: Yes, they are quite often found there. That is specifically a city that a lot of the social construct revolves around the cross-section between the mortal races and devils.
Marisha: I wonder if they have guides. I wonder if I can be like a tiefling tour guide for you guys.
Laura: Maybe you could be our conduit, the person that brings us to--
Marisha: Yeah, like an ambassador, an escort.
Taliesin: Already have us under contract.
Marisha: Already have you under contract.
Laura: Sure.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Do you feel up to this level of deception? I say with all seriousness.
Marisha: (inhales) You know it's not my strongest suit, and I recognize this.
Laura: Wait, wait, Tary. Do you have anything, like a spell you can make, any kind of trinket, (laughs) that would help Keyleth be better at lying?
Matt: "Oh, well, I do believe that I can enhance somebody's visage."
Laura: Well, not that, no. I'm talking an actual like ability to tell lies better. Something that would up her maybe charisma?
Marisha: Does he have Enhance Ability? Is that what you are talking about?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: He can give me Enhance Ability which means I would get advantage on checks.
Laura: That's better.
Marisha: Which I can do on myself as well. Yeah. So, yeah, I can give myself, you know, I can--
Matt: "But I can do it as well, and probably a little better."
Marisha: And Tary can do it as well. I'll talk into a mirror for a little bit, practice some things that tieflings might say. What are things tieflings say?
Taliesin: Oh God, I'm a tiefling. What happened? Why has this happened to me?
Marisha: "Oh God, I'm a tiefling. What happened? Why is this happening to me?" See?
Laura: That's perfect, that's perfect.
Taliesin: It's uncanny.
Travis: I don't believe you.
Liam: We are so close to being able to semi-retire and take it easy. We cannot cock this up. We're going to hell, we've no plan! What if we went and were completely honest, and were ourselves? And explained that we were here to remove the shittiest devil in the city?
Laura: Seriously? Seriously?
Liam: I am being serious.
Travis: Yeah, he does have a slight point.
Liam: We tried that. We've tried that. I mean, maybe it'll work. We just run willy-nilly. That's what we do.
Travis: Maybe we do them a favor, it's not like we're saying--
Taliesin: I'm of the opinion that a bunch of mortals show up in the City of Dis looking for a rakshasa, I think they're going to be able to put two and two together.
Marisha: Why? Yeah, they're going to know. I honestly don't think anyone's going to have a problem with us killing this guy. It's just a matter of do we want to be full Vox Machina? Because it might paint a giant target on us. Or maybe have someone as a silent escort? I could try and not speak a whole lot.
Liam: Yeah, I mean, you could--
Marisha: I could just-- maybe I could be a mute escort? I had my tongue cut out.
Liam: I mean, I just feel like our-- certainly without Scanman-- our chances of fooling anybody are lower than they've ever been. So maybe having you as a tiefling escort gives a little credibility to the dummies there.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: There's lots of people who're not dummies, though, and I feel like we should just quietly negotiate our way through, because I don't think we can bullshit, not without Scanlan.
Taliesin: I think that's very fair.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: I agree. Okay.
Travis: I got lost, but I agree.
Laura: Did you ever get a response from Sam on his potions? So, I didn't want to tell.
Liam: Six regular, three medium, one superstar. If you need gold, I've got loads.
Travis: It's literally right there.
Laura: Oh. I didn't know you wrote it down, Grog.
Travis: Motherfuck--
Laura: You can't count. Okay, we gotta pass these potions out. Who wants a superior?
Liam: I do.
Travis: Oh, do you have those potions?
Laura: Yeah. Yeah, Tary gave them to me.
Taliesin: They were gift-wrapped and everything.
Laura: Did you steal them from me when I wasn't noticing? Because if you did I would have perceived it.
Matt: "I did, sorry."
Travis: Perceived it?
Laura: Yeah, I would have. Because I have really high perceiving.
Matt: "I thought that's why you wanted it gift-wrapped."
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: I'll take any-- I forget the sizes, is it venti, or grande?
Laura: I don't want you dying again. Take the superior.
Liam: Ooh, thank you.
Laura: Is that all right with everyone?
Taliesin: Yes, that's perfectly fine.
Matt: "I will say I did buy them, if I could also--"
Laura: Really, Tary? Because you have all those patches, I thought that's the reason you gave them to us.
Matt: "Oh, but they're measly trifles of healing, I could use something--"
Liam: Tary, how tough is that armor?
Matt: "The best that money could buy."
Liam: Yeah, but is it ceremonial or is it like shit-kicker?
Matt: "It's functional."
Laura: Do you want two regular potions, how is that, Tary? Is that good for you? In addition to your patches? Or would you want one of the greaters that you bought for us?
Matt: "Greater."
Laura: Wow, all right, sure, take it back.
Taliesin: (laughs) I'm so sad Sam couldn't be here for that.
Laura: Okay, I'll take a greater as well.
Marisha: All right.
Travis: Are you sure you don't want to give me one? Because I usually end up pouring it into one of you sloppy saps.
Laura: Good call. Greater for Grog.
Liam: That's a good idea.
Laura: So that's all three greaters taken.
Taliesin: I'll take two regular if you've got them.
Laura: Two regulars for Percy, two regulars for Keyleth.
Marisha: Sure.
Laura: And that's-- well, that's two regulars left.
Liam: That's like strapping a turkey baster to a tank, that's what that is.
Travis: Yeah, yeah.
Marisha: I would maybe just keep those or give them to Grog maybe, once again.
Travis: Get up. (laughs)
Laura: Okay, so Grog.
Travis: What?
Laura: You have two regulars and one greater.
Travis: Yarr.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Fred, Freddie. Do we know what languages are likely to be spoken there?
Travis: Oh, good question.
Liam: Does that say in your books?
Marisha: Did you just call Percy 'Freddie'? I like it.
Laura: He keeps calling him that.
Matt: Infernal.
Liam: It's his name, isn't it?
Travis: Frederick.
Taliesin: Infernal? They speak Infernal. Technically it would be a middle name.
Liam: Do you speak Infernal? Well, it is--
Taliesin: I do not speak Infernal.
Liam: -- your name, is it not? You have 37 of them, am I allowed to use any of ones between the first and the last?
Taliesin: I am struggling to find a reason why not, which is somewhat irritating.
Liam: You know, we're years into being friends. What do you prefer?
Taliesin: Percy is just perfectly reasonable.
Travis: What about D-Roll?
Laura: What about Von?
Marisha: D-Roll's pretty good.
Liam: D-Roll--
Laura: What about Musel?
Liam: Oh jeez, I was just about to agree on it but--
Taliesin: My god, you've found the line, and I've drawn it.
Liam: I don't know, D-Roll's pretty good. Man, D-Roll's great!
Taliesin: D-Roll is actually pretty slick.
Liam: I'm suddenly extremely jealous of Grog for coming up with that name. Oh man, yeah, that's going to haunt you, my friend.
Taliesin: You're just going to end up Wings someday, that's all I'm saying.
Liam: Y'all wanna stop and get a wing?
Laura: Infernal. But they speak Common, I'm assuming, as well.
Matt: You don't know. You really don't know.
Laura: Ah, shit. We don't know anybody who speaks Infernal, do we?
Marisha: Hey, Tary.
Liam: What about Zahra?
Marisha: Do you have any spells that help you be able to speak languages? Isn't there a spell called Languages?
Matt: "Not at the moment. However, if we have enough time, I'm sure we could go and find a local class that teaches, maybe go to the Lyceum and we could learn the basics. Few weeks."
Travis: Tary, do you want me to punch you in the face?
Matt: "No, I do not. Please, don't do that. Which, by the way, if we need any sort of healing--" And he rummages through his pouch here and says, "I can muster a couple of short-term potions if it gets too bad."
Laura: Why did you take one of the greaters if you can make healing potions on your own?
Matt: "Well, I can only really use one for myself, and I wanted a backup."
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: So Infernal is going to be a problem.
Liam: And we're taking Doty with us? Is that the plan?
Matt: "I don't see why we wouldn't. Why would we not want to bring him with us?"
Liam: I'm sure there's lots of robits in hell.
Taliesin: Does Doty speak Infernal?
Matt: "Doty doesn't speak."
Taliesin: Can he write in Infernal?
Liam: Is he a protocol droid?
Matt: This is where it would be useful for Sam to send me his character sheet so I would know what languages he chose. But because Sam's not here, no. Doty does not know or speak Infernal.
Liam: Somewhere an aerator's going (raspberry).
Travis: Sam's stuff is right there, isn't it?
Laura: Oh, yeah!
Taliesin: No, that's my stuff. I'm spreading because he's not here.
Laura: Understandable.
Marisha: Not really.
Laura: Man-spreading.
Travis: Can we tear off your sleeve and then you understand Infernal?
Matt: "No, you don't need to do that."
Travis: We could try.
Matt: "I would not recommend it."
Taliesin: I speak Disco, but not Infernal.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: So sorry.
Marisha: (sings) Disco Inferno.
Taliesin: I'm not really that sorry.
Travis: You can't just off-the-cuff that. You've gotta save that for something.
Taliesin: That was for the Aladdin earlier. I had to do something in retaliation. We're looking to see if anything--
Laura: I speak Abyssal, but that's the other ones.
Liam: That's the other guys.
Marisha: I mean, if I wanted to use Shapechange to actually turn myself into--
Laura: A succubus.
Marisha: -- a succubus or a rakshasa, then I would speak Infernal because I do get that with-- we didn't really fully decide. It never specifies.
Matt: I would say, yeah.
Marisha: Because you get everything, but you just keep your intellect, wisdom, and--
Travis: Yeah, do that!
Liam: You get a whole other language?
Laura: Tight, then make yourself a succubus.
Matt: Well, no, you keep your intellect, it's not like you learn what the creature would know. So probably not.
Marisha: But you learn their spells and abilities. You automatically get those.
Liam: Are the spells in the brain, though? Or in the body?
Marisha: It doesn't specify in the spell. It's kind of what you decide.
Taliesin: It depends on what kind of spell. Like, elemental spells--
Laura: I really want to see what you look like as a succubus, personally.
Taliesin: I do, too. This picture they have in the book is quite exciting.
Marisha: Yeah, she's got a whip.
Taliesin: Yes, she does.
Matt: Any average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the spellcasting trait. So you don't get any spells. If you turn into something that has spellcasting, you don't get their spells. You maintain your intellect--
Marisha: But I get their abilities.
Matt: You get their abilities, their physical abilities and things they can do.
Laura: Oh, but that's different than knowing their language.
Matt: Yeah. So I don't think you'd pick up a language.
Travis: Yeah. You get to suck.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: Sorry.
Taliesin: Well, we may have to actually hire a guide once we're in there, then.
Laura: No, we can't hire anyone! Why can't we just a hire a tiefling? Don't you have any other tieflings in your tribe?
Marisha: Maybe, but I imagine they would be super-rare.
Liam: You've been gone a while.
Marisha: Do we have any?
Liam: Maybe ask dear old Dad.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of-- thank you for the text. So, he checked on the languages that Doty knew.
Laura: Aw, that's great.
Matt: And Infernal was not one of them, I'm sorry. So there are two tieflings that exist in this society. They're pretty rare when it comes to Ashari, just because a lot of tieflings tend to not feel comfortable in some natural elements sometimes.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: One of them is about six years old. And the other predominantly works as a gardener in the vicinity.
Marisha: So it's not a guarantee that they know Infernal, necessarily?
Matt: It's not a guarantee, I don't think.
Taliesin: We could go ask.
Laura: I think we go.
Marisha: I could go ask. I mean, I could go and get a few buzz-words, you know--
Liam: Let's find that six-year-old.
Marisha: -- hello, goodbye, please, thank you, left, right.
Taliesin: No, thank you.
Matt: Actually, most tieflings do learn Infernal as a language.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: You guys have been talking late into the evening, it's maybe one or two in the morning.
Laura: So go in the morning, find out. If not, we'll just go there and hope that someone speaks Common.
Taliesin: It is called Common for a reason.
Marisha: Yeah, Common. I feel like we'll be okay.
Liam: Well, we can't sit here and wait for him to come back, we've just gotta fucking do it, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Unless-- I could try and talk to Dad, too, and see if he has anything that might help with languages, but I don't know. I think we'll be okay. We'll be all right, right?
Laura: It's just hell.
Marisha: It's just hell. It's fine.
Laura: No big deal. Fine.
Marisha: Okay, so do we have a vague plan? Should we sleep?
Taliesin: Sleep, talk to the gardener.
Liam: But if we do this, we're done. We can take it easy.
Laura: Ish.
Taliesin: For a bit.
Liam: To do what? What is left? The dragons are dead. All that's left is Hotis. What is left?
Laura: The fucking deal that I made with your fucking goddess. Who knows if she'll call us out on it, but.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: There's that.
Liam: Well, I'm not going to run right back to the temple. Are you?
Laura: Well, hell no. She creeps me out.
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: I saw her face. It's fucking weird.
Marisha: Yeah, I saw that-- wait, you guys all saw-- we really talked to--
Laura: Yeah, that happened.
Marisha: Because that feels like a fever-dream. That happened, you saw that.
Laura: Did you know we saw her?
Marisha: Grog, you saw that, right?
Laura: The giant white mask?
Marisha: The giant white face.
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Grog.
Marisha: Grog.
Laura: I feel like Grog's getting more--
Marisha: Indignant?
Laura: I feel like you're lying more now than you used to.
Travis: That is not true. (laughter)
Liam: What do you want to do after this, Grog? Say we get back from hell. What's the next step for you? I mean, we're going to party, that's a given, but, like, are you done with the Herd?
Travis: Oh, I dunno, I never look that far ahead. It keeps disappointment low.
Marisha: No expectations. I like it.
Travis: Yep.
Marisha: I mean, it's bad for goals, but yeah.
Travis: Goals?
Marisha: High-five, buddy.
Travis: Hey!
Marisha: Hey!
Travis: (with a mouthful of drink) I don't have any plans, so I do anything and it normally works out great.
Marisha: Word.
Taliesin: There were words in there.
Laura: I actually understood it. How fucked-up is that?
Travis: You don't need to see all the way to the horizon, right? You just gotta see right in front of your own little feet. You'll get there.
Liam: Yeah. You remember that time a sword killed you? (laughter)
Travis: Yep.
Liam: You do, yeah. Doesn't always work out. Sometimes it gets cocked up, yeah?
Travis: Not yet.
Liam: Not yet.
Taliesin: He's got a point.
Marisha: He does have a point.
Laura: This is true. I mean, we're all here.
Marisha: Has anyone stopped to wonder why we're all still alive?
Taliesin: All the time.
Marisha: Yeah, by all likelihood we shouldn't be. That's fun. Good times, good times. What about you, Vex? What are you doing after we take a retirement?
Laura: Oh, wow, this is happening.
Travis: Percy.
Laura: (laughs) Good one, Grog. I mean, yeah.
Marisha: I mean, we knew that.
Laura: I'm going to hopefully build up my small house.
Taliesin: You do have a small house if you're feeling--
Liam: Has it been built?
Laura: No, no, it needs to be.
Taliesin: It needs to be. There's land.
Liam: 'Twill be.
Taliesin: Yeah, 'twill be. It's going to be lovely.
Marisha: 'Twill be lovely.
Travis: Are you going to be like Mr. Bates on Downton Abbey afterwards?
Laura: I don't know who that is.
Marisha: Considering your idea of "small".
Taliesin: It was very nice before it caught fire.
Liam: This is the sweetest before-we-all-die.
Taliesin: This is, and the Grey Hunt itself is eventually going to be popping up.
Laura: I would love to know what that is.
Marisha: What is the Grey Hunt, Percy? You keep saying what the Grey Hunt is.
Liam: Yeah, bust that out.
Marisha: What is it?
Taliesin: What's your plans, Kiki?
Liam: Whoa, whoa, back it up.
Marisha: It's nothing. It's nothing, is what it is.
Laura: I feel like the Grey Hunt is something really terrible and you just haven't told me.
Taliesin: It's not terrible.
Liam: Bust it out, D-Roll.
Taliesin: No, no, no, I mean, there's some boring bits of it, obviously.
Liam: Well, tell us the juicy bits of it.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: (sighs)
Marisha: Is it like paying your taxes, where it's not a real thing, but you kind of have to do it because it's on paper, and someone tells you to?
Laura: Do I get a jolly hat out of it?
Taliesin: Where does she learn this stuff? I've never--
Marisha: I learned it from you, Percy!
Taliesin: Oh my god. (laughter)
Travis: "I learned it from you!" (laughter)
Travis: No guilt.
Taliesin: Part of the Grey Hunt-- and this happens not every season, but often on Winter's Crest festivals, and again it is an official title and does actually carry with it some responsibilities beyond that, but they're very, very you, they'll be fine-- is, and I can't give too much of it away because part of the ritual is also--
Marisha: Oh my god! Tell us something!
Taliesin: You are going to have to go into the woods, and meet something.
Liam: He's making this up as he goes.
Taliesin: No, I'm really not.
Laura: Meet something?
Taliesin: You go into the woods, there are creatures that live in the woods that have been affected by the land, that have gained some--
Travis: You're going to shroom your tits off.
Laura: Do I get really high? Is this the whole point of the Grey Hunt?
Taliesin: Whitestone. There are things within the earth of Whitestone that have certain power and certain energies, and they have been seeped into the plants and the stones and the animals themselves, and your job will be--
Laura: Do I have to find the highest animal in the woods?
Taliesin: More or less.
Liam: I am starting to regret that I asked. What's the punchline?
Taliesin: The punchline is you're going to go and you're going to have to actually bring back a kill, and it will be a very specific kill that is asked for.
Laura: Oh, wow.
Taliesin: But part of that then gives you a practically divine right to manage and look after the creatures of the woods, and our hunting, and what is reasonable to be killed, and otherwise. I think I'm covering most of it--
Marisha: How do you mean divine? Like she can see things? If she kills the radioactive beast does that mean she gets radioactive powers?
Taliesin: Divine more in the sense of what reasonable people do to tell commoners that we're allowed to talk to them.
Marisha: Oh. That's not as fun.
Taliesin: Less exciting.
Laura: Do I go alone or do I get help?
Taliesin: You do go alone. No, you do not get help.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Marisha: That's so cool.
Liam: You're so fucking transparent sometimes.
Laura: Sounds fun.
Taliesin: I think you're going to do very well.
Marisha: Oh, you'll be fine!
Laura: I look forward to it.
Marisha: She's killed tree beasts and dragons, she's fine.
Liam: Everything under the sun.
Travis: Tree beasts or three beasts?
Marisha: Both!
Laura: Look, my light-up 20 just lit up for no reason as we were talking about it. I think it'll go very well.
Taliesin: It's a sign. It'll be a lovely Winter's Crest. We haven't had a master or mistress of the Grey Hunt in many, many, many years.
Marisha: So, what are you going to do when we take a break, Percy? You still haven't answered the question.
Taliesin: I don't know. I mean, I think I'm going home. I say "I think." I'm going home. There will be work to do there.
Laura: Don't look at me.
Taliesin: And I have plans for my city. I have plans for the people. I want to make it great again. I want to make it shining, beautiful, comfortable for everyone.
Marisha: You know, I might need your help. I have a few ideas for the Ashari tribes as well.
Taliesin: I think that that would be an excellent thing, for our two people to communicate very regularly.
Marisha: I think they need to.
Taliesin: I think they must.
Marisha: Can you help me build some sort of, maybe like, alarm system?
Taliesin: That sounds very expensive, I'm not sure that that's possible. Yes, of course I can help you with something like that.
Marisha: Okay! But with taxpayer's money. Also something else you taught me.
Taliesin: It will be a string on a bell. You're learning so well.
Marisha: Yeah, just two cups on a string.
Laura: Can we go to bed?
Marisha: Yeah. Let's do that. (laughter)
Taliesin: Are we all sleeping in this hut, or do we have separate huts? We're all sleeping in this hut, aren't we?
Liam: Welcome to your yurt.
Travis: Is it all water outside still? Like, a little bit of water on the ground? No. We're not there anymore.
Laura: It's windy. You're up on a cliff.
Matt: Grog is very drunk at this point.
Liam: So drunk.
Travis: There's so much water outsi-- (laughter)
Matt: No, you guys do have separate places to stay. People clear out in clusters, you have your own locations to sleep.
Liam: Why does it smell like mayo?
Laura: That's gross.
Travis: Taste of choice.
Liam: It is mayo! Take that!
Laura: He's just been drinking mayo. (laughs)
Travis: Takes a strong constitution.
Liam: That is vile! (laughter)
Taliesin: That's probably not kept well.
Laura: That's so gross. All right.
Taliesin: Goodnight, lovely people.
Matt: You guys rest for the evening. The morning comes, with your mayo hangover. (laughter)
Travis: It's so pure, it never leaves a hangover. (laughter)
Matt: As morning comes around, you all come to consciousness. The village of Zephra is already come to life. You can see that the townspeople are up and about, they're handling their business. The guard's being tended to. You can see the Windriders are already out, leaping from mountain peak to mountain peak, doing their perimeters in the vicinity. The children are up and being led to their various outdoor classes. The city is alive, and your business is your own.
Marisha: I get information on that gardener and where to find him. Or them. Or she. Or he. I don't know who they are.
Matt: Right. It's easy enough to find, in this city in particular a tiefling sticks out like a sore thumb. You see a woman, probably in her-- it's hard to tell with a tiefling, demon don't crack. But she's a little older, she's in her 40s probably. Dark purple skin, the horns curl backward and come to almost a singular point behind--
Laura: Oh, cool.
Matt: And the dark hair shifts in streaks of gray, but she's in the middle of what looks to be, gloves on, in the process of checking and planting more seeds.
Marisha: Do I know her name? Did I get a name?
Matt: Yeah. This is Whitney.
Marisha: Whitney.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: I've tagged along, by the way.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Not her given name, but the name she chose when she joined the Zephra.
Marisha: Sure. Okay.
Matt: You've interfaced here and there, nothing too immediate. You were very young and you were still-- last you were in the village, being pushed towards this place of greatness, so a lot of people didn't interact with you directly too much.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: But you've seen her around.
Marisha: When we were like kiddies? Oh, no, but she'd be forever--
Matt: She was older, much older.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: As you approach, she stops and wipes the dust from her hands, and turns, "Ah! My lady Keyleth, I'm sorry." And she stands up and does, like a small--
Marisha: Don't do that. The bowing thing is-- I've always been uncomfortable with it, don't--
Matt: "I didn't really know what to do--"
Marisha: No! It's-- No, don't, it's fine. No. You're fine. You're great! Hi!
Matt: "Hi."
Marisha: Good to see you!
Matt: "You as well, congratulations."
Marisha: Oh, thank you. I was just wondering if I could actually just ask you a few questions, on behalf of everybody.
Matt: "Certainly, what can I do to help?"
Marisha: Well, okay. (sighs) I don't know if this is a sensitive subject or not, I know you've been away from this for a little bit, but it seems me and my team are going to the Nine Hells. To the City of Dis. And, yeah. No. I know. We all had the same reaction. (laughs) I just, I didn't know if you could actually help me with any Infernal language or any knowledge that might help, or if you still know the language.
Matt: "I've not had to use it in a very long time. I don't know much about what you're talking about, I've lived here my whole life. I don't know what else I can offer, as far as-- I can read a little Infernal, and I can understand it if I hear it, I haven't really had to speak it in a while. What do you need?"
Marisha: Well, we were thinking of going in under disguise as, potentially, as tieflings, since they are more common there.
Matt: "All right."
Marisha: So I didn't know if you could share any basics of your language?
Matt: "What do you want to know?"
Marisha: Well, you know, hello. Goodbye. Thanks. Sorry. Left, right.
Matt: "Oh, all right." And she takes a minute and has to scratch her head, you can see it's been a long time since she's ever had to exercise her Infernal-speaking muscles--
Marisha: Do you want to do this over breakfast? I can, we'd be more than happy to buy you breakfast.
Matt: "I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm in the middle of my work here. Okay. For a greeting, I mean as much as there is one. It's pretty abrupt." And if you're keeping tabs on this, it's pronounced "koo-thok".
All: Kuthok.
Taliesin: Kuthok. We're all going to say that over and over again now. Kuthok.
Liam: It's like Klingon.
Laura: Yeah, it does. It sounds like Klingon.
Marisha: Okay, cool.
Laura: Emphasis on "THOK". (laughter)
Marisha: KuTHOK. You're right.
Matt: "There's, goodbye is very similar. Kuthrek."
Marisha: Kuthrek.
Matt: "That is usually said in a very forceful manner. Goodbyes outside of-- it's usually a very stern separation."
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: "What else did you--?"
Liam: Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm Lady Keyleth's... friend, and--
Marisha: (laughs)
Liam: Aren't I, though?
Marisha: No. Sorry. I saw the hesitation and it was cute. Keep going.
Liam: All right. We-- You grew up here, so I don't know if this means anything to you, but we are searching for a rakshasa. Do you know what that is?
Matt: "I'm afraid I do not."
Liam: No.
Matt: "Look, it's all right. I understand, I-- many people just assume because of the way I look that I know a lot about devils and demons."
Marisha: No! No, no, no! I--
Matt: But I really don't. I'm sorry.
Liam: No, it's all right. Sorry.
Matt: "It's okay. I just--"
Liam: Yeah, we're-- we're kind of grasping at straws so I hope we didn't offend.
Matt: "No, no offense taken. Just-- I wish I could be of more help. I'm sorry."
Travis: (whispers) Insight check.
Matt: "Any other phrases?"
Laura: (whispers) Insight check.
Liam: (whispers) No.
Marisha: I mean-- maybe like a 'yes' and a 'no'? And then we'll totally leave you to your work, because I feel like I've totally interrupted, like, your flow and I'm so sorry.
Matt: "It's okay. You're allowed to. You're the Voice of the Tempest, for goodness sake. I--"
Marisha: Doesn't excuse me from human decency. (laughs)
Matt: "Fair enough. 'Yes' is-- 'yes' or an acknowledgement, is more of a 'yai'."
All: Yai.
Marisha: Yai. Was that right?
Laura: Episode 91, where we force Matt to make up an entire language on the spot.
Marisha: Yeah. (laughs)
Matt: Yeah. Thanks guys.
Taliesin: This is so wonderfully Doctor Dolittle.
Laura: Yai equals yes.
Travis: Ai.
Marisha: Yai.
Laura: Nai. Nern. (laughter)
Travis: She's not even waiting for it.
Liam: Ermahgerd.
Matt: Sure, that's it now, guys. (laughter)
Taliesin: No! No! Damn it Liam!
Marisha: Fuck! Shut up! Shut up!
Laura: No, not 'ermahgerd'!
Matt: It is now.
Marisha: Come on. Come on, really?
Liam: He's god.
Laura: No he is not.
Liam: Ermahgerd.
Laura: Oh. My. God.
Taliesin: Ermahgerd. I hate you.
Laura: That's canon.
Taliesin: It's going in the book.
Liam: What's that, Mr. Disco? Who do you hate? (laughter)
Laura: Thanks a lot, Liam!
Taliesin: You and she of the so-called "Tempest" can both--
Liam: You're welcome. (laughter)
Travis: Brilliant. You're not going to ask her any questions? But she's a fuckin' felon on the run from the Hells. You're just going to let her go--
Marisha: She's not a felon on the run. I've known her since I was a child.
Travis: No, you're a fool. You're blind.
Laura: We're not here, so don't worry. We're not having this conversation in front of her.
Travis: She's a mass murderer and you let her pick your vegetables.
Marisha: She's a peaceful fucking gardener for the past 20 years.
Travis: It's a great cover.
Laura: For the past 20 years.
Liam: Speaking of which, do you know-- what's the word for peace? Is there a word for peace? Do you know?
Matt: "Not that I know of."
Liam: All right. Shit. This was not very fruitful.
Marisha: Mm. It's the Nine Hells. Is there a word for 'thank you'? Do they thank people there?
Matt: "It's similar to 'goodbye'."
Marisha: (laughs) It's similar to goodbye.
Liam: Is it more or less forceful?
Matt: "About the same. It can mean both."
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: Can be both?
Liam: It's an inflection thing?
Matt: Well, it's more like 'aloha.' It can be 'hello' or 'goodbye', you know.
Liam: I feel like we've hassled this woman enough.
Laura: You should ask, like, how to say 'Don't fuck with me.'
Marisha: Yeah, I feel bad. Whitney.
Liam: Well that's a bit of a complicated phrase for someone who barely knows how to say 'hi' and 'bye.' Woman who's not here.
Laura: Ermahgerd.
Marisha: Thank you so much for us interrupting your morning. Is there anything you'd like from me in return?
Matt: "Just leave me to my gardening, if that's okay." (laughter)
Liam: Yeah, we can be annoying sometimes. We understand.
Travis: She's got more people to bury.
Marisha: Great to see you. See you again.
Matt: "You as well."
Marisha: Man. So good to be home. Okay, let's go! Vax?
Matt: As soon as you start walking away in the awkward quiet you hear her say over your shoulder, "Good luck."
Marisha: "Thanks." I don't look back out of embarrassment.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Taliesin: Ah. Voice of the Tempest.
Marisha: Voice of the Tempest, motherfuckers!
Liam: "Kuthrek."
Marisha: First act of being king!
Laura: Kathrek. Kuthrek.
Liam: I don't know if I said that right.
Laura: It's koothrek.
Liam: I just said tangerine in--
Marisha: It's Kuthok. Kuthrek. Yai. And ermahgerd.
Matt: (with accent) Ermahgerd.
Laura: What is it?
Liam: Mordor.
Matt: Yeah, you got to roll it.
Marisha: Rounded vowels. (laughter)
Matt: We've all suffered through those pronunciations.
Liam: Inside baseball.
Travis: Make it the last word in a four-sentence line.
Laura: No!
Matt: Mordor. Anyway, sorry. Voice-acting lamenting. So!
Marisha: Metamucil?
Taliesin: Mm. Open your portal to the Nine Hells.
Matt: That's a 6th-level spell. So what do you guys want to do?
Travis: Regularity.
Taliesin: I think it's-- are we going to just do this?
Travis: How did it go? Did you learn everything?
Marisha: You know, it went about as well as one could expect?
Travis: I expected it to go pretty fucking well.
Laura: Did you learn all of the language?
Marisha: Uh-huh, I totally learned all the language in one 15-minute setting of annoying a poor gardener.
Laura: Well, tell us what you learned so that we can speak it too.
Marisha: Okay. Hello, hello-- kuthok.
All: Kuthok!
Laura: Kuthok. Got it.
Marisha: Kuthok. Yeah, an emphasis on 'thok'.
Laura: Got it.
Marisha: Uh-huh. Goodbye--
Liam: Is Cusack.
Marisha: Close. Close. Kuthrek.
All: Kuthrek.
Laura: Check.
Travis: Oopeck.
Marisha: Yes  yai.
All: Yai.
Laura: It's like 'yay', only kind of weird.
All: Yai.
Matt: So excited for this. (laughter)
Liam: I'm not.
Taliesin: (whispers) Hate you.
Marisha: No-- is ermahgerd.
All: Ermahgerd.
Marisha: It's impressive that no is the most complicated one. I know.
Taliesin: So how do you say, 'Do you speak Common?'
Laura: I think probably, 'Do you speak Common?'
Taliesin: Oh, well, that's fair. (laughter)
Travis: That's it? That's all you got?
Taliesin: It's remarkable.
Marisha: She didn't remember a whole lot. She's been living amongst us for quite a while. In fact, she never lived in the Nine Hells, because apparently that was maybe vaguely offensive?
Laura: Well, yeah.
Travis: Did you believe her?
Taliesin: She kills at night.
Marisha: She's n-- yes. I've known her for a while.
Travis: What's her last name?
Laura: What's her mother's name?
Marisha: (laughs) What's her mother's name?!
Taliesin: No. No, I'm calling that one.
Travis: She's coming with us though, right?
Laura: Did you learn how to say 'Leave us alone'?
Liam: She wasn't very good on phrasing.
Marisha: Ermahgerd.
Laura: That works.
Liam: It was just words.
Marisha: Just words.
Taliesin: Yet I will say, 'yes', 'no', 'please,' and 'thank you' can get you through an enormous amount of transactions with reasonable people.
Marisha: Well, we don't have 'please' and 'thank you' because apparently they--
Laura: It's the Nine fucking Hells, nobody says please and thank you.
Marisha: Yeah, they're not very polite.
Taliesin: So 'yes' and 'no' get you through an awful lot.
Liam: If a horrible devil is bearing down on you to kill you, you just say 'Ermahgerd, ermahgerd, ermahgerd, ermahgerd, ermahgerd, ermahgerd.' (laughter)
Marisha: It's like the equivalent of the Shia Leboeuf 'Nanananana!'
Travis: Nononono!
Marisha: Nananana no.
Laura: Check! This is great.
Matt: I am so excited for this.
Taliesin: We are stalling.
Marisha: This is going great. We are totally stalling.
Laura: All right, we should probably go.
Travis: How do we feel about kidnapping the nine-year-old tiefling?
Matt: You hear the tearing of paper behind you as Taryon takes a sheet from Doty's book and is now, "Ermahgerd."
Laura: Uh-huh.
Matt: "Er-- (clears throat)--er-- (high pitched voice)-- ermahgerd. Er-- I'm practicing."
Liam: Get it out of your system now, because when we get over there you should probably keep your voice down.
Laura: You've got to be, like, so cool. You've got to be the coolest.
Liam: And if that means not talking, that's what it's got to be, all right?
Travis: Tary do you remember how dangerous the kraken was?
Matt: "Yes, but we still prevailed."
Travis: And this is like-- (whispers) what's a big number?
Liam: Seven.
Travis: This is, like, seven times more dangerous.
Taliesin: Easily.
Liam: Yeah. Everybody's a kraken there. More or less.
Taliesin: A city of krakens.
Matt: "Well, do we all have to go?"
Travis: Only if you want to become, you know, a full-fledged, permanent, into-the-histories member of Vox Machina.
Liam: Is that on the table?
Matt: "Then I accept!"
Travis: Mm. Wise choice.
Taliesin: It is now.
Travis: A wise choice. It's only like part of it.
Taliesin: This is assuming that we're going to survive, to be fair, so--
Laura: I know, we could all die.
Taliesin: It's a lot of assumption. Oh, any of us. Any.
Matt: "What?"
Taliesin: Nothing, it's going to be great.
Laura: Let's do this. Let's build Dis city.
Travis: Do you have a will made up?
Taliesin: How do you even know that-- I-- no, never mind.
Travis: Don't worry about it, we'll get to that later.
Liam: The multi-verse is large and wide.
Matt: All right. What's the plan?
Marisha: Time is a flat circle.
Laura: (sings) Let's go to Dis city.
Marisha: (sings) We built Dis city on rock--
Taliesin: Nope. Nope.
Travis: I will shave both of your heads.
Taliesin: Thank you. Thank you. I'm behind this plan. It's a good plan.
Liam: Not in character.
Marisha: That was a bad song.
Travis: (electric razor noise)
Marisha: All right. Are we going?
Laura: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Are we going? Are we ready?
Laura: I mean, I was kind of joking, but sure. Let's go.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: What is this? What is this creepy, weird--
Liam: Who Dis?
Laura: Who Dis? Who dat?
Marisha: Who Dis? We gotta hold hands and then--
Taliesin: Wait are you above me or below me?
Travis: I'm above you.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: Good job. Bamf, City of Dis.
Matt: As you all hold hands, and you complete the ritual, the incantations leaving your lips, your vision suddenly grows dark as the magics of the spell pluck you from your home plane and thrust you into the space between.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: Before you, a glow begins as you rocket towards an unexpected and incredible sight: an endless permeable tapestry, a tangled lattice of burning, divine fire appears before you, writhing and growing as you shoot towards it with incredible speed. You instinctively wince and curl, a promise of impact triggering your need to defend yourself, the dread as the air begins to heat around you. Then-- whoom-- you impact and pass through harmlessly, the heat fading. You glance over your shoulder to see it gone. You just passed through the Divine Gate.
Travis: The Divine Gate.
Matt: You glance over your shoulder to see it vanish, but then another flash of red magical power consumes your vision as your feet suddenly find hard ground. As the rush of powerful energies subside, the swirl of color and sudden thrust of movement coming to an abrupt halt, you find yourself standing within an extremely dark alleyway of some kind, framed by the exterior of dark stone buildings, climbing up above you for many, many stories. The cracked, thick cobblestones that mark the floor are littered with filth, slivers of cracked skulls and bones, as well as discarded refuse of some indeterminate origin. The air here is extremely hot, the walls and floors themselves around you seemingly the source. As you look, you glance out past both sides of this alleyway you've somehow arrived in, and the air distorts with intense heat as smoke rises from the streets themselves around you, the occasional ash or ember drifting through the air in front. Now, the dense city that surrounds you is incredibly massive; the walls, the structures that clutter the immense black metropolis surrounding you glow at the edges like heated glass. As you peek past and look further out, you can see the city is a broken maze of metal ramparts built into miles of steep hillsides and shattered towers framing an endless labyrinth of twisting alleyways. Within these streets, your eyes dart around to see dozens of molten, slithering masses of flesh shifting past the mouth of the alleyway, roiling, stepping with sick slapping sound, their faces twisted into a grotesque look of ever-retching horror, the sound escaping like a (gasps in pain) wince with an underlying screech and scream. You see behind them, cracking lashes over these masses of flesh, two large humanoid devils with spine-like protrusions that come jutting out of the sides of ash-white skin pulled tight against a massive skeletal form, the backs of their bodies forming these gargantuan scorpion-like tails that dangle, looming dangerously in front of them. As they step forward (whip sounds), two more lashes go, you see these fleshy masses (gasps) begin to clutter up again and move further past the exit to the alley as these bone devil-like creatures slowly crawl past. One of them stops for a second and continues walking as you all hold your breath. A sudden, horrid stench of decay fills the air as they pass. You hear them crackling in the distance as they shove along their tortured charges. As you glance up past them, you see the sky now: dozens of winged shadows glide through the air across a greenish, cloudy, barely lit sky that flashes with far distant cracks of lightning, occasionally brightening darker shapes, larger, looming in the distance. But one that draws your eye like a terrible dream, unable to look away upon noticing it, is an impossibly colossal tower of black iron and lead, stretching for hundreds of miles into the sky before vanishing into the dark, clouded expanse above you. You blink and turn around to look at the other side of the horizon, but there stands the exact same tower. You shift around; no matter your view of that horrid horizon, there stands the Iron Tower, the throne of the archdevil, Dispater, standing ever-vigilant over his Iron City of Dis. And that's where we're going to take a break.
Marisha: Good, I have to pee so bad!
Laura: Wait, I have a question! We did a Heroes' Feast last night, right?
Matt: Nope!
Marisha: Nope, we didn't!
Laura: I thought we said we were going to do it! I thought we were going to do it!
Matt: You gotta say you're going to do it. Nobody said it.
Laura: Didn't we say we were going to do it?!
Liam: Might have said it last game, but I don't remember it this game.
Travis: We didn't say it.
Laura: I thought we said it in the last game.
Liam: No, but then you have to follow through--
Laura: Shit balls mother bitch fuck balls!
Taliesin: It's okay, we're going to find an inn.
Matt: We're going to take a break here, guys, real fast. For the chat room, we're giving away this really awesome Wyrmwood.
Laura: Ah, that's some of my favorite wood right there!
Matt: It is the black and white ebony tabletop dice tray. It's fantastic. The word to use in the Twitch chat-- if you're in Alpha, move over to Twitch chat to make sure you put this in there to be part of this giveaway-- the word of the night is 'Doty', D-O-T-Y.
Laura: It should be 'ermahgerd,' but whatever.
Matt: They've already established it. Next episode.
Liam: Too bad, so sad.
Matt: Back here in a few minutes, and we'll pick up where we left off. See you guys shortly.
Travis: Holy shit! [break]
Matt: Welcome back. So, first, before it begins, our winner of the chatroom who's going to win the awesome dice box from Wyrmwood is Thaign, T-H-A-I-G-N.
Taliesin: Thaign. (cheering)
Matt: So congratulations, we'll get your information and get that sent to you, well done.
Laura: Fight!
Travis: The box is really sweet, We just saw it.
Laura: Yeah, we did.
Matt: All right, so, as you guys have just taken in as much of the scenery as you can here within someplace in an alley in the center of the City of Dis. Where no matter where you look, the creepy distant tower of iron seems to follow--
Laura: (whispers) Dis tower.
Matt: -- your vision no matter where on the horizon you glance. Ever watching, ever present.
Travis: That's weird.
Matt: What do you want to do?
Travis: Send up a flare.
Taliesin: While we can do that--
Laura: Let's put our hoods and cloaks on. Weren't you going to make yourself look like a tiefling?
Marisha: I, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do it right now. Is anyone watching?
Laura: Can I see if anybody is watching right now?
Taliesin: There's an omnipresent iron tower that's watching.
Laura: Is there a-- I mean, iron tower?
Taliesin: It's more the 'omnipresent' part that was really the point of that, but yes.
Laura: I thought you said an eye on a tower, and I was like, that's a different tower.
Matt: That's a different tower.
Taliesin: That's copyrighted, I'm well aware.
Marisha: Percy's got a good point. We might want to try and get out of the street. Get indoors. Yeah.
Laura: Can I perceive anywhere that looks like where travelers would stay?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: I'll do the same.
Laura: 30.
Liam: That's better than me. 24.
Matt: Okay. As you come up to the edge and lean against the wall, looking over the side. First, a moment passes, and as your shoulder hits the wall, you smell something burning as you glance back. Suddenly your shoulder, you can see the heat of the actual wall with just a brief contact to your body has begun to burn--
Travis: What?
Matt: -- and singe the outside of your cloak.
Laura: Oh crap!
Liam: Pat your hair, pat your hair, pat your hair, pat your hair.
Laura: Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Marisha: Wait, from just peeking around the corner?
Matt: From just leaning and touching the wall.
Travis: (groans) Ugh, it's Tucson.
Matt: You immediately notice that the bottom elements of your shoes are melting a little bit on the bottom with your steps.
Laura: Oh my gosh. Good thing rubber doesn't exist here.
Matt: The city itself is just this emanating source of perpetual heat. You're already sweating in the presence here, and as you glance around the corner and look at these buildings that rise up, you can see the architecture is hooked to the corner as the monolithic deep reds and blacks and grays that everything's built from, nothing belies an exterior that would seem to be welcoming to a traveling pack of people, at least not from your current standpoint.
Liam: And remind us, it's dim or it's not super bright here, is it? Dark?
Matt: No. It's not super dark either. Imagine a very very very very cloudy day around sunset.
Laura: Well. I don't know what to do other than to-- Does it look like there's anybody around us that can see us? Anybody watching?
Matt: (laughs) Are you trying to be stealthy?
Laura: I mean, I'm glancing subtly, trying to look like a badass but also stealthy.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Laura: 18.
Matt: Okay. As you glance out to the side, you watch as two, what look to be humanoid, normal-sized humans, but deep red skin, black hair, horns curled at the front of the forehead and folded leathery wings at their sides, begin stepping off from one of the nearby roads that seems to go further into the city, and they walk past and one of them glances over and sees you. And they both just keep walking, seemingly not affected or alerted by your presence.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Looking about each side of the road as you go, there is a lot of movement through these streets, there are a lot of creatures, all sorts of weird shapes, you see a lot of that weird fleshy mass that you saw stepping forward, there's clusters of them all over. Many of them seem to be herded or pushed, some seem to be almost chained together in places and being dragged around.
Laura: Is it like that thing we ran into in-- Was it Kraghammer? Where were we where that thing was like a mash of bones and stuff?
Liam: Oh, in the field of bone shards.
Matt: Oh, right, right!
Laura: Is it like that?
Matt: No, imagine a very, very rotund person that is perpetually melting out of clay, and-- let me just show you a picture, actually.
Travis: Is it like a fondue pot of nine people in one?
Matt: There's a single face.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: It's like a walking shit sack, yeah?
Matt: Kind of.
Taliesin: Pizza the Hutt.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: That right there.
Laura: Ew! You can't even see legs!
Matt: It's just these, like a liquified person that is just a somewhat-shifting, burbling forth fleshy sack that occasionally-- you can see like the mouth and what looks almost like a face that is ever-screaming and writhing in pain.
Laura: That seems awful.
Travis: This guy needs some calcium.
Laura: Wait, imma put my glasses on so I can see it again! Oh, you already closed it.
Matt: I can bring it back up again, it's all right.
Travis: Right next to that beautiful picture of a--
Matt: Oh, yeah! Well, you've already seen the other creatures before.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Matt: But that's your fun one there.
Laura: That is so creepy. Okay.
Matt: But they're being herded around. You see smaller creatures, you see imps, which you've encountered before: tiny winged leathery humanoid creatures that flutter around and seem to be more keeping a peripheral view, an overhead view of the goings-on of each one of these clusters of entities being pulled through the city. You see a handful attending each of these that move along, these humanoid devils that have long polearms, and from their dark, almost like bluish-purple skin, what looks to be almost like a series of jagged pointed tendrils that jut from the bottom of their chin and almost like writhe and curl as they push forward, occasionally shoving their weapon into the side of these things and just getting them back on track as they wander off.
Laura: Do I see anything that looks like normal Exandrians? People that are just like--
Matt: At the very-- at this moment, no. And you get the sense that, at least, they're not super common. (laughs) Almost everyone that is currently walking through the street in this particular intersection seems to be of some sort of devilish heritage.
Laura: Right. I go back to our group and say, well, I was spotted for sure. Nobody seemed to pay me very much mind, but there's nobody here that looks like us. I don't know if we've happened to pop into a particular area of the city that is inhabited mostly by devils, but that's where we are.
Travis: Do we know what layer we're in?
Taliesin: Dis would be--
Marisha: What layer of Hell? It's like, the third, fourth? Second.
Liam: Dis is two.
Travis: Oh, we gotta find the--
Liam: What level Dis?
Travis: Open market, right?
Laura: Yes, the market.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Oh, right.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: If we find the market, we'll find an inn. Find an inn, we'll find a place to drink and get a room.
Travis: Please don't make me be the one that remembered all the shit about Dis. I mean, I am The Grand Poobah de Doink of All of Dis and That, so.
Laura: Oh, that's true, you would know!
Travis: Y'all motherfuckers is coming with me.
Taliesin: Oh no, I can already see that going poorly.
Laura: I feel like we should put our hoods up and just generally act like we belong here.
Liam: Just walk with purpose.
Marisha: Do you think if I do an Alter Self here that people will notice?
Laura: Can you do it quickly? I mean--
Marisha: Yeah, I can do it at will.
Laura: We're in an alleyway.
Taliesin: All right, let's all make the changing circle.
Marisha: Yeah, just shield me, like we're changing at the beach.
Laura: Can you just lean in front of Keyleth?
Marisha: Look casual. Don't touch the wall, you'll burn!
Travis: Ahh!
Matt: Which actually, you do immediately take four points of fire damage as you do so.
Liam: Aww, poor baby.
Marisha: Aww, buddy!
Laura: Put some mayonnaise on it, you'll feel better.
Marisha: Yeah, it's true.
Travis: Mayonnaise (squelching noise).
Matt: So, are you changing your appearance?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to--
Laura: Can you imagine how sour Grog must smell all the time? He just has mayonnaise on him.
Liam: Curdled dairy at all times.
Travis: Or how much I love it? Sam said he can cast Alter Self on himself plus three others.
Matt: Yes, I'm working on that.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, he can do it on others?
Matt: Yeah, people who can actually cast the spell, they can cast on other people, but you as a druid ability, you can only do it right on yourself.
Marisha: Oh, copy. Cool. I'm going to look like kind of a vague cross between Whitney and Zahra.
Matt: Okay, and as you do that, Taryon immediately goes, "Oh, great idea!" and he turns himself into-- he pulls out a small object and clicks it for a second, as it does, his form shifts into an almost identical-looking--
Travis: Female?
Matt: (laughs) No, a male tiefling. And then goes, "Who else, who else? Who else would like my blessing?"
Marisha: You know? Hold off on that. I'm not saying it's not a good idea, but maybe we should workshop it. What--
Laura: I want to be one.
Matt: "I knew you would!" And he comes forward and pulls another one out and as he breaks this small capsule in your direction, this burst of arcane energy hits you and all of a sudden, your form shifts into an almost identical-looking tiefling; same colors--
Laura: No, change it up-- stop, Taryon!
Matt: "I wh-- okay! Ah!" and he tries to finagle with it for the last second as the spell just about takes hold of your shape goes slightly more, and he goes, "Uh, blue?" and you're a little more blue. It's the tail-end, like the "Eh?"
Marisha: Hang on, hang on, we don't want to be--
Liam: No, I'm talking it out. You can do that to how many more of us?
Laura: Two more people.
Matt: "Two more!"
Laura: (laughs) Kidding, he knew.
Taliesin: I'll take one, why not?
Laura: Yeah, Grog can look like Grog.
Liam: I feel like a handful of tieflings and Grog is better than us as we are.
Taliesin: I would agree.
Matt: He goes ahead and takes one--
Laura: But make him more red. Pink!
Marisha: Hang on, hang on, how long does Alter Self last when it's just a spell? Because if we were going to try and eat some food, and take a break, then maybe we should do that first? Are we still doing that, or are we just going head-on into this? Feel like our plan's already dissolving.
Laura: No no, we need to get a-- we need to eat.
Liam: Yeah, we're in a back alley.
Travis: Heroes' Feast.
Liam: We gotta walk through this town.
Marisha: I can find it too, Matt.
Matt: I'm looking it up, hold on.
Marisha: Alter Self lasts for one hour.
Matt: Correct, concentration though, right?
Laura: Okay, well that'd-- concentration?
Matt: Yeah, and so--
Taliesin: If we go into a fight, it doesn't matter. I'll take grey.
Matt: "Well, by all means!" and he hands you the small capsule-- It's almost like he enchants the coins, you're actually casting the spells on yourself, so you are concentrating on the spell.
Marisha: Okay, so I guess we will get through this city and eat a Heroes' Feast when we get to our destination?
Laura: Yeah, and then we'll just Alter Self again.
Liam: So I can do this on my own then?
Matt: "Yeah, by all means."
Liam: Fuck it, all white.
Laura: White?
Matt: You become an albino--
Travis: Whoa!
Matt: -- tiefling of your own intrinsic design.
Laura: Way to totally blend in.
Travis: Cool!
Marisha: Very, very unique.
Laura: Good job, rogue.
Liam: Do you think everybody here dresses like the Raven Queen's butler? I mean--
Matt: You have encountered an albino tiefling before.
Taliesin: We have.
Marisha: Have we?
Liam: Smartypants.
Taliesin: Lillith.
Laura: Lillith was an albino?
Marisha: Lillith.
Laura: That's why she was so pale.
Marisha: She was so cute!
Liam: You can say you're sorry.
Laura: I'm not.
Liam: You're not? You should be.
Laura: I'm not!
Liam: You're wrong, though.
Taliesin: Right! Let's find ourselves a marketplace and an inn!
Marisha: And a rakshasa.
Taliesin: Let's go. I am going to step out into the street.
Laura: Act like you belong here. Act tough and cool.
Taliesin: With pomp and circumstance and purpose.
Marisha: I join Percy.
Taliesin: Please don't write things down while I do that.
Laura: Oh no!
Taliesin: That's not nice!
Laura: Act like you belong.
Matt: Why, whatever do you mean?
Laura: People will buy it. We just walk looking straight ahead; don't look around too much.
Marisha: Yep yep!
Liam: 10% what you say, 90% how you say it.
Taliesin: I act like me, I think I'm going to be fine.
Liam: I act like Percy.
Taliesin: He's also going to be fine.
Matt: As you guys step out into the main road, you can see the cracked stones that make up the walkway here. Even just walking through here, though you feel confident in your placement, the presence here you're still getting used to, and it's something about the air, or you feel just a little dizzy as you're still adjusting to the heat, to the placement, to the strange ever-so-faintly non-Euclidian structure to the landscape around you. It's forcing you to consciously right your posture and pay more attention to your surroundings than you normally would. There's just something about the presence here that's unwelcoming. You can see there are a number of other streets that head in any direction. It's hard to tell which way is further into the city and which is further out, it's so vast. Even the City of Brass or Ank'harel in their size, none of them seem to really scrape the surface of the sheer immensity of the City of Dis by comparison.
Liam: This should be easy.
Taliesin: I wouldn't know from reading anything, I wouldn't have a vague idea of where to go? I have a theory at the moment, but it's pretty light.
Matt: From what you read, it was mostly about the structure of the society, there was no well-written cartographer's experience--
Taliesin: Hitchhiker's Guide to the City of Dis. I say we head to the tower.
Laura: The tower's in every direction.
Taliesin: So, whichever direction it is, that's the way we'll head.
Travis: Wow. That's true.
Liam: So it's that way.
Marisha: And also that way!
Liam: Some people go both ways.
Taliesin: I feel like if I were going to build a giant tower that couldn't be ignored, I would have that be the center of anything and every place. It may not even matter.
Liam: Let's take a stroll and see a lay of the land.
Marisha: As we start taking a stroll, can I do a nature check to see if I can spot any native beasts, insects, etc.? Native animals, birds.
Matt: Make a nature check.
Marisha: Critters, and the usual.
Matt: Sure. This would be more perception, actually because you're trying to pick up details in the scenery.
Marisha: Perception check?
Matt: Nature to understand if you knew what they were.
Marisha: That's a shithole roll  14.
Matt: 14?
Marisha: Total.
Matt: You do, occasionally, catch what looks to be some element of small, flying, buzzing pests, but they're different than what you're used to. The brief glances you get of one that comes nearby, it seems to have eight sets of wings and some horrid-looking pincers on the front and looks like a nasty denizen of the scenery. And immediately, you're like, "Ugh!"
Travis: I lean over to Vex, and I say, oi. In an effort to blend in, should we just kill a random person?
Laura: I feel like only if it's called for, yeah?
Travis: I just thought of it, so does that mean it's called for? Is that what you do here?
Laura: No, probably not just yet.
Travis: They might really like it here.
Laura: I know, they could, but they also thrive on order.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: And I feel like that's a little out of order.
Travis: Right. I'm glad I asked you.
Laura: Me too.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: Keep doing that.
Travis: Asking you?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Why is our life so much like Vaudeville?
Marisha: You do like the theater.
Liam: That's true.
Marisha: Do you think a Pass Without a Trace spell would be beneficial here?
Laura: It's concentration.
Taliesin: Why try to be complicated?
Liam: Let's just own this.
Taliesin: Let's own it.
Liam: Take a walk. Percival.
Taliesin: No fear!
Liam: Strut!
Taliesin: I strut.
Laura: (gasps) Maybe we can drop a little bit of dust of tracelessness behind us, though, so we're-- no?
Taliesin: No, let's not make a scene. I'm going to look for signs to look for the sorts of people who are walking around, if there seems to be a flow of traffic, if people seem to be going in a direction, coming from a direction.
Matt: Okay!
Taliesin: Getting a sense of the city.
Matt: While heading towards the tower?
Taliesin: While heading towards the tower to make sure that I am trying to get a lay of the land so maybe I can see if we should veer off in a direction. I'm also looking for humans, someone who might speak Common.
Liam: And, are there stores, are there businesses? Are these all non-descript buildings, or does it all just look like the same shit? Or is it--
Matt: They are varying, but there's nothing here that looks like a welcoming shopfront. The structures are varied, but any of the signs or any of the scrollings that you see chiseled into the stonework and metal is not a language--
Liam: So, it's like a hellish financial district, there's just nothing there.
Matt: Loosely, yeah. It looks like Detroit on Halloween.
Liam: Purge!
Travis: Love you, Detroit.
Taliesin: It's been a while.
Matt: Yeah, man. Devil's Night, it's great.
Liam: Hell.
Matt: So, you follow. As Doty's (stomping) behind Tary, staying as close to the middle of all of you guys and shielding himself between your various bodies. You continue to follow Percival as you step through, paying attention. Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Laura: I'm going to keep an eye out for anybody that looks like they're noticing us too much, anything.
Liam: Yeah, same.
Laura: Of course.
Travis: Natural snitch.
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Marisha: Natural snitch!
Matt: You are--
Taliesin: -- a problem.
Matt: You are a problem.
Taliesin: I may have to-- I'm aware that there's a lifespan on this die, that I may eventually need to put it away.
Liam: We are in hell. If it's going to come out anywhere--
Travis: If you roll one more natural 20, it's just going to dissolve into gold dust and float away.
Taliesin: Heads.
Matt: It's okay. One of these days, your contract will come to me.
Taliesin: I'm well aware.
Liam: If you lift up Taliesin's mohawk, you can see the little tiny, little points. Little horns.
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: Or the maze. You walk for the next ten or so minutes. Two things you notice, looking for patterns and elements of the city around. There does seem to be a general direction of, not individuals as such, but a lot of these fleshy masses, which you've read about in the book, they're referred to as lemures. They are fallen damned souls that have been tortured into this specific form that are the lowest base level of devil that exists here.
Marisha: Just a fleshy mass, Liam.
Liam: I want to go to bed.
Matt: But a lot of them seem to be going in this certain direction. It's difficult to maintain focus on the direction of the tower if you have to avert your eyes. However, if you're looking in a particular direction, it doesn't follow your vision when you move, it's whenever you have to look away and change your perspective on the horizon, that's when it appears elsewhere. So, you assert yourself in a direction and maintain that way. After about ten, 15 minutes, there's no discernable gaining of distance on the tower.
Liam: Oh, for fuck's sake.
Taliesin: In that case, I'm going to find a lemure and inquire sternly of directions.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Sternly?
Matt: As you're walking, you see there are three of them currently that are chained together with two of these weird black, jagged spiked collar and midsection bands that are jammed into their sides and they're all joined and the hooks and the chains are screwed into the side of this building. They do not appear to be currently attended at the moment. And, as you approach one is there like (gurgling).
Taliesin: Kuthok.
Matt: (pained gurgling)
Taliesin: Marketplace.
Matt: (pained gurgling)
Taliesin: Point.
Liam: That is fucking disgusting.
Matt: There is no language. It looks like it can't really communicate.
Laura: Oh god.
Marisha: Wow.
Laura: That's really sad.
Marisha: It kind of is.
Taliesin: Well, that's depressing. All right. What building are they currently chained to?
Matt: It's about a three-story tall, long tower. It's long on one side and then half the size on the other, and it juts up like a monolith that comes from these two hooks at the top. There's no signs or particular language on its exterior, but there does appear to be a doorway, a big, black metal iron doorway that is closed maybe a foot to the left of them. You're--
Laura: Does it look like people are coming in and out of that building?
Matt: If you wait a moment, you can find out.
Laura: Maybe we can post up and see, or just walk on in.
Taliesin: I wouldn't recommend walking on in.
Liam: We're walking and nothing's changing. Do we want to stay put for a while and see what happens?
Laura: Well, our surroundings are changing, we're just not--
Matt: (crashing noise) At this point, the door shifts open with a slam, there's a burst of phosphorous-type clouded fume that drifts out from the interior as, curling down, looming from the inside, another one of those large, lanky, skeletal-looking devils with the giant scorpion tail lurches out, and sees all of you clustered over, and begins to rush up quickly and grabs the side of where the hook is jammed into the wall and just breaks it out with its bare strength, and yanks the lemures closer. (speaks Infernal) You see its jaw almost seems to disconnect and unhinge for a moment as it gets impossibly long and its tongue (slurping noise) and begins to just walk away from you guys down the road, dragging these lemures behind it from the chains.
Laura: As soon as he opened the door, I wanted to get a look inside of where he came out.
Matt: Perception check.
Laura: It was almost a 20, but it was a 25.
Matt: 25? You get a very brief glance on the inside. Very dark, red light seems to slightly light the interior. It looks almost like a shelf of some kind. That's as much of a view as you got. It was just some sort of a shelf, bit of furniture in the side there.
Laura: Fuck.
Liam: Hotis, where the fuck are you?
Laura: Where's a fucking place we can have a stupid feast?
Marisha: If we can get to a safe, quiet place, I can do a Locate Creature spell and see if I can find him. I can also scry on him, but I need to--
Laura: You need something--
Marisha: Something not in this back alley of a street.
Liam: Did that devil who just left leave the door wide open, or did it shut it?
Matt: No, the door slammed open and as it walked towards you guys, slammed it shut behind it.
Taliesin: Which way did the creature go?
Matt: Loosely the same direction as where you were walking for the tower.
Laura: Keep walking in that direction--
Taliesin: Keep walking in that direction--
Taliesin: See if we can gently catch up, just to the vague periphery, so if I can see them, then great, and if not, oh well.
Matt: Are you following this group? Is that what's going on?
Taliesin: (indecisive noise) From a gentle long distance, and not with great intent.
Marisha: Was he talking to the lemures, or to us?
Matt: Talking to you guys.
Marisha: To back the fuck off? Okay.
Matt: You were clustered around, apparently, his charge or--
Marisha: His, yeah, his people. "Back the fuck off from my people", yeah.
Taliesin: That was a chain devil?
Matt: No, this was a bone devil.
Taliesin: That was a bone devil? All right.
Matt: I can show you what that looks like.
Travis: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Marisha: This means I could theoretically turn into him now that I've met them, right?
Matt: Technically, yeah.
Taliesin: That won't go poorly.
Marisha: Nope!
Travis: Get. The fuck. Out of my nightmares.
Taliesin: (Minnesotan accent) "Hello, we're from outta town, y'know?"
Laura: (Minnesotan accent) "Oh, don't ya know?"
Marisha: (Minnesotan accent) "Oh, don't ya know?"
Taliesin: (Minnesotan accent) "Oh, don't ya know?"
Marisha: (Minnesotan accent) "Yo, I got my Polaroid with me."
Matt: "Oh, hello."
All: "Oh, hello."
Travis: And we all fall out.
Taliesin: And we all die. Too much Fargo lately.
Matt: As you tail this from a distance, go ahead and make a stealth check, Percival.
Taliesin: Well, that's-- 15.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm not-- (indecisive noise) Keeping my distance.
Marisha: He's D-Rollin'.
Laura: They see me-- no.
Marisha: I love Laura bailing so fast.
Matt: As you guys are following Percival's lead along the roads here, the heat is starting to really crawl under your armor-- those of you who are wearing it, you're fine, Grog. You watch as the lemures are dragged off into an alley to the right.
Taliesin: If they go to an alley, then I'm not going to go down an alley. I'm going to walk by and maybe look down the alley from across the street, but I'm not-- I'm trying to stay on main roads.
Matt: You make a large arc around and glance over. You can see them being pulled down the alleyway, and then to the left around the corner.
Taliesin: No-- That feels like a trap to me. That feels like the sort of thing I would do if I wanted to shank someone in an alley.
Liam: I've done that, actually, that's true.
Taliesin: I knew you had.
Laura: Do I see any buildings that look like people are coming in and out raucously?
Matt: Not yet, no.
Liam: What if we walked for a while and looked back. Let's give it ten minutes, and then we'll figure something out.
Taliesin: We'll take a left at the next main thoroughfare.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: He's going to keep an eye out for anybody watching us.
Matt: Perception check.
Laura: While I'm looking for buildings.
Liam: 27.
Matt: Okay. You do hear the occasional screech in the air, as you see these winged entities in the distance just (screeching). As they just dive through and around the top of the city.
Marisha: Do we recognise what they are? Are they wyverns? What are they?
Matt: No, there's a humanoid aspect to their bodies but they're just beyond the general red glow of the city to make out their details.
Marisha: I'm going to try and start focusing on that for the next walk. When one gets down close, I want to see if I can see what it is?
Matt: Okay. Some of them look to be imps. Armored imps. These tiny little things that dive through. Some appear to be larger. Some have long tails that draw behind them, their giant leathery wings, and they just glide through. You get a glance at one that seems to have a human torso and legs that are hanging at its sides as it swoops through, like a sentinel just watching over the city. A lot seem to be doing arcs to and from the tower as you watch these patterns--
Laura: I could fly up in the air and see if I can spot a market.
Marisha: I could Beast Shape into something that's natural--
Liam: That's better.
Taliesin: Is it?
Liam: Better? Well, I don't like anybody going up.
Matt: Ten minutes' travel, Percival, by the way? Still not anywhere near closer to the tower.
Marisha: Weird thought  what if we try to walk away from the tower?
Taliesin: There is no walking away from the tower.
Liam: This is stupid. What if I think about being in front of the tower?
Matt: Do you just think about it?
Liam: Yeah. That's it.
Matt: Okay, so you walk towards the tower, but thinking about being there. So you guys keep walking for a bit. You get about two blocks before you see the next major road turns to the right, and there you can see, this road you've been on, which seemed sparse as far as the denizens of the City of Dis-- As soon as this big roadway opens to the right of you, the buildings seem to grow larger and taller, and they seem to almost twist and collide the higher they get. They're all constructed from metal and iron, but there's almost an organic, natural curvature at times that seems warped, causing a few to almost seem to collide and jut into each other at their peak. Many of them have these big, black metal chains that dangle from the outside, and giant, evil-looking hooks mounted onto the front of the buildings, some of which currently hold lemures that sit there and writhe on it, like a punishment for something they did. In the roads themselves, a lot of them have pikes jutting up, and it looks like sections of the road cracked open, and there are natural rock spikes and formations that have protruded out from the ancient construct of the city. But people just walk around them as they go. And you do see more people down this way. You see more of those devil-like creatures, you see a few tieflings in the distance. You see a few humans. You see a few fair-skinned folk wandering through. You see that same bone devil that earlier you saw emerge from the side alleyway about two blocks up, still clutching those three other lemures behind it by chain. It walks up to another bone devil that seems to be sitting off to the side, and is in the process of scratching the side of its horrible, bony chin and jaw. It comes up to it, and they both speak and snarl. You cannot read their lips, because they don't really have lips, and you don't know Infernal. But they both almost become a unit, and walking side-by-side head further down that path, with the three chained lemures behind them. Glancing over, you do see, as you've been focusing on the ground and around you, look up, and the tower has shifted position down to the end of that roadway. You thinking of it--
Laura: Was that what did it?
Matt: No. It's still the same distance it ever has been. In the process of losing its sight from your peripheral, due to other buildings closing off your vision-- As soon as you lose sight of it entirely and reassess where your vision is on the horizon, there the tower is once more.
Liam: Does it always feel like it's dead ahead of us, all the time?
Laura: No, it's always off to the side, right?
Matt: It changes. As soon as you become aware of the horizon, it becomes oriented wherever that awareness is.
Laura: How about I watch any of the people, the humanoids, or anything like that, that are together-- Can I see them talking, does it look like any of them are speaking Common, if I'm trying to read their lips--
Matt: They're quite a ways away from you. You're not able to make out any detail.
Laura: I'll walk in the direction, just get in the area that they're in, so that I can try to read their lips.
Marisha: Once again, I want to keep an eye out, because I had a shitty perception check, for any birds, bats, beasts that I see flying?
Matt: No birds, no bats, no beasts. There isn't a whole lot of indigenous wildlife within the Hells, it seems. Or at least nothing that would be considered a beast.
Marisha: Insects?
Matt: Even the insect you saw earlier, or the insect-like creature, it had twisted, fiendish qualities to it on a very micro scale.
Liam: That was an ambassador.
Marisha: It probably was! That's the thing, it probably was!
Liam: I'm going to trail my sister by like ten feet and watch her back.
Matt: You're moving closer to get a view of lip-reading. What's everyone else doing?
Travis: Is the ground as hot as the walls are?
Matt: It is. Even as you're walking, you've grown somewhat accustomed to the uncomfortable heat that your boots are currently mustering. Thankfully, you guys are wearing footwear designed to endure environmental hazards, or magical footwear, for some of you. But you imagine if you were to stand still for too long in one place, it would probably end up damaging any sort of regular footwear worn.
Travis: Jesus. It's like a parking lot in Texas.
Taliesin: Venice in August. Beach, not--
Travis: Is there anything about the humans in particular? Are they wearing anything unusual, or do they have any company with them that might denote why they're allowed to roam about?
Matt: The two that you see ahead of you, a man and a woman, the man has stark white hair that is almost wet, and brushed very tight to the back of the skull, with a series of black and red markings or tattoos, or some sort of scar, that goes across one side of his face. A very, very thick nose piercing that connects to a chain that links to the back of his ear and is wearing layered, black leather armor. The woman, who is currently conversing with him on the other side, has long black hair with a shock of white that curls to the front. Her skin is a deep reddish brown, tan color, and her armor is a dull gray, like a cloth-patterned armor? But she seems to have at her side a very wicked-looking scimitar that is hanging at her belt, and she rests her arm on it, casually. You look just past them, and you can see they have two sacks resting on the ground as they're having this conversation, and a cage.
Travis: Empty?
Matt: The cage is not empty, there is something inside, but you're not quite close enough to make out any details. You can just see there is a cage and some shape inside. You make a perception check.
Laura: That's cocked. (deep voice) 27.
Matt: I will say make a stealth check as well. This is to both get close enough to witness their conversation but not be noticed as overtly trying to--
Laura: 17.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: That was bad.
Matt: You saddle up and instinctually go to lean on the wall. And go (winces). This is not conducive to your usual casual tactics. But you pay attention and you catch bits and pieces of their conversation. They're arguing about price. They are both talking about how much it's worth. Is it even worth bringing it here? We've come this far. We already have the offer. Might as well go through with it. One of them talks about how they hate the Fetters.
Laura: The Fetters?
Matt: The Fetters.
Travis: (whispers) I bet it's one of those little dudes we had.
Matt: Then one of them goes, let's get going, this place makes me feel uncomfortable.
Laura: I still can't see what they have in the cage?
Matt: You can glance just barely past and you can see what looks to be some sort of a humanoid. Naked. You can't make out much more detail. You can't tell if it's male or female. It appears to be medium- to light-skinned. You can't get much detail beyond that from this distance, unfortunately.
Marisha: How big is this cage?
Matt: It's maybe four foot by three foot. A little smaller, actually. It would be more like three foot by two foot, because it looks pretty cramped.
Laura: I'm going to walk up to them. Before they walk away.
Matt: As they both start turning to walk, one of them--
Laura: I'm going to be casual as I do it. I just walk up.
Matt: You can see there is a couple of chains fixed to the front of this cage and there is a handle of some kind that the guy lifts. There are small wheels you can now see that are fixed onto the cage that you can now see as it rolls--
Laura: I don't even look at the cage at all, like I don't give a shit about it. And I walk up and I say--
Matt: The woman immediately turns and sees you, and her hand moves from resting on the pommel of the blade to grasping the handle.
Liam: Same.
Laura: Oh! Are you with me?
Liam: Ten feet behind you.
Laura: I signal at you to come over. I don't want to look like I'm talking to the people, yet. I'm just walking in their direction, and I lean over to my brother and say, God I hate this place, don't you?
Liam: Yep. Pretty much.
Laura: (exhales) It's so hot. I wish we were back home.
Liam: Everything fucking looks the same.
Laura: Right.
Liam: Nondescript bullshit.
Laura: I make eye contact with the woman as I say it.
Matt: Make a subtle deception check. They are intensely paranoid, it seems.
Laura: 30-- no, 20-- 21.
Matt: She stands there, and keeps watching you. The guy who was pulling the cage stops, turns around and looks. You can see the chain swing and dangle for a second before coming to a stop as he glances back, his eyes iris-less. Just dark pupils with white around them. And he just-- not a snarl, but a very intense stare, he doesn't seem to be put at ease, but he's definitely paying attention. (cell phone rings)
Laura: Can I help you?
Matt: As he silences his cell phone. "I'm sorry, what?"
Laura: You were staring at me, darling.
Matt: "You, unless I'm mistaken, approached our space."
Laura: Oh, you had claimed it. Sorry. Everything here's claimed.
Matt: She turns around, and gives him the expression of, fucking shove off, and he takes the chain, and begins to tug it and they both walk away.
Laura: That didn't go as well as I planned. (laughs) I just want to find a fucking tavern!
Matt: You just let them walk away?
Laura: Yeah, but as they walk away I want to look at the fucking cage and really get a good look at what they had.
Matt: Glancing inside, you're not sure how old or how young, but there is a definitely beaten, wounded young man. Between the streaks of blood and visible gashes and lash marks, the skin seems pretty vibrant and clean. This is a creature that was taken here. This person was taken here against their interest and is being dragged in a direction.
Laura: All right, before they walk off I go, oi! You made a deal for that one yet?
Matt: They turn back and look at you. "Yeah."
Laura: Where do you go? I have something I'd like to sell as well.
Matt: "We don't share our clients." And they both just keep walking back in the direction they were going.
Laura: It's not working. I'm trying so hard.
Marisha: You're doing great. It was amazing.
Liam: Hey, man.
Laura: (whispers) Oh god!
Liam: What about-- I want to get off the street. I'm tired of walking. We've been walking all--
Matt: He's about 20 feet from you.
Liam: We've been walking all day.
Matt: He's not even turning around. They are just walking away.
Liam: Are you whispering that to me?
Laura: Yes, I am whispering to you. It didn't work. We find other people.
Travis: I am currently spitting on the ground and watching it evaporate.
Matt: And it does. It's like (psh).
Travis: Ooh!
Laura: I mean, do I see a tavern around here? It seems like a busy sort of street.
Matt: (laughs) You can keep walking and looking for some sort of a tavern.
Taliesin: Are there any other people around? I'm going to give a roll.
Matt: Sure, I mean, there are people, those are the only two humans that you had seen in the vicinity. Again, you saw--
Taliesin: Tieflings?
Matt: -- you saw a handful of tieflings a little even further down the road and you see a few humanoid-like devils that are just covered in barbs and spines that seem to walk in spurts, like they'll step, step, and then dash a few steps and then stop and then glance around nervously and then continue forward. Roughly human-sized, maybe a little smaller.
Marisha: Is everyone here afraid that they're going to be murdered at any corner?
Taliesin: No, obviously-- just us. Let's try this proper. I'm going to start walking and see if I can make eye contact with anything.
Marisha: You're going to try to make eye contact with these people?
Matt: Are you guys following them or are you staying back with your party?
Taliesin: Well, I am walking in their direction anyway--
Matt: You guys have caught up to them now and Percival is apparently walking forward so--
Laura: Percy, where are you going?
Taliesin: Just trying to--
Marisha: Did you notice no one here makes eye contact with you? It's really weird.
Taliesin: Well, they did.
Laura: I follow in the general direction of those people that walked off.
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm going to head toward the tieflings as well. Which I think is the same direction anyway, so.
Matt: Yeah. As you are following from a distance these two humans, the two tieflings that were conversing split off. One walks across the way and vanishes into an alley. The other one joins, not the humans, but seems to be walking in the same direction if maybe about 20 or so feet ahead of them.
Marisha: As we walk a little bit, I just want to covertly heat up my hands, light them up a little bit and then touch the wall to see if it burns me as well a little bit. Just graze my fingers along it.
Matt: The flames that you create from your hand are magically produced and insulated from your body because you are the source of their magic by the blessing of the emberstone that you struck. It does not unfortunately protect you from the searing heat from the building as you reach out. (sizzle) You immediately take four points of fire damage.
Marisha: Even though my mantle of the tempest, I ignore extreme heat?
Matt: You do ignore extreme heat from a general air, like being on a desert. It doesn't prevent you from touching a fire and burning your hands.
Marisha: It's what I was curious about.
Liam: Stove. Stove. Stove! Stove! Ahh!
Marisha: S'good, s'good. It feels good. It feels good. Stove cat.
Taliesin: Stove cat.
Matt: Some of the rolling clouds, you hear a distant clap of thunder roll through the vicinity as the occasional flashes of bluish-white and green ash clouds on top of you.
Liam: Those humans are both gone, out of sight?
Matt: No, they're still in sight, you guys are slowly following from a distance.
Laura: You said they split off? They split away from each other?
Matt: The humans kept going. The tieflings that he was following, there were two of them that were loosely stepping in, they split off. One vanished into an alley, the other began walking in the same direction.
Liam: Do we talk to this guy? Because I'm about to. We're fucking dicking around, here.
Taliesin: I'm just going to ask somebody where to find a pub or an inn. Not trying to be coy. Not trying to be interesting.
Liam: We can't pretend shit here. Let's just go talk to them.
Marisha: Wait, are we interesting?
Taliesin: Yes, we are interesting.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: You watch as three different flying imp-like creatures suddenly dart off the nearby buildings and dart past you, and you watch as the two humans stop and drag themselves off to the side. The tiefling that was walking not far ahead of them takes a few steps back and waits patiently. As you watch, stepping through one of the adjacent roadways, about three or four small devils that have these barbed spines that stick out of their body in all directions come walking through, carrying these little spears.
Laura: We step off to the side.
Taliesin: I push everybody to the side and down.
Matt: As a procession behind them you see a familiar creature. You see a massive, rippling red-muscled pit fiend come stepping through.
Marisha: Oh no!
Laura: Not the one! Not that one!
Marisha: It's not the same one?
Travis: He said a familiar creature.
Matt: And the creature is familiar. You're not--
Laura: It doesn't mean it's the pit fiend.
Matt: But you see it begins lurching through the street, strolling like it's walking with purpose to whatever business destination it has. But it has an entourage around it of lesser demons that are all clearing the street as it walks. You see the respect that a creature of this strength has even within the center of this sphere of hell. Behind it, you see a very large orb, about ten feet in diameter. It's a glistening, golden glass and on the inside, it seems to have what look to be almost a hundred different screaming faces pressed against it from the inside that are merging and swirling. As it's being pulled by these lesser demons behind it, the pit fiend's just walking like it's the middle of its work day. As it crosses the path, the demons and the cart continue past out of view, and eventually the various entities walking the street before pick up their pace and continue on like nothing happened.
Taliesin: I kind of like it here.
Marisha: I subtly, as he goes by, study and examine what he looks like, the pit fiend.
Matt: It's very similar in size and shape, design, musculature as the one you battled in the City of Brass. There are a couple of pretty quick-to-pick-out marks and changes in the bony crest and horns on its head, and the coloration on its wings go to a dark, deep purple as opposed to the bright, vibrant red of the last one. So, it is a different entity than the one you battled. You continue walking and you're starting to notice, as you follow these people forward, that the further you walk in this path, and already the sides of the alleys and street corners and such were pretty littered with broken refuse pushed into the corners, but the further you step into this, the more and more destitute and filthy the city seems to become. You begin to see more and more lesser demons just sitting off to the side, just lazily looking around for some sort of impulse to kick in, and grab something that's dangling from the bottom of whatever food chain exists here. You see more lemures that are in the process of being grabbed and fought over, that have just dwindled over time, like their fleshy, tortured soul mass has been abused and slowly disintegrated and has been left to be fought over by whatever exists in this area. The buildings themselves begin becoming less these large monolithic towers of black iron and more resembling sagging, stone-like swamp structures that have a blackish-purple moss that seems to seep from the side; the air almost becomes more humid with the heat as you pass through. The streets are becoming far more dense. You are seeing more humanoids of different races, you're seeing more of the lesser devils coalescing in these center spaces, and you do see what appears to be some semblance of what you would call a devilish tavern. There is no music, there is no lively chatter, but you do see what looks to be chairs, you look to see what seems to be a common area where some entities are sitting and partaking in food of some kind.
Marisha: As we move through the streets, I just want to trail behind Vax and take a look at if anyone's reacting to him unusually, or taking notice of him.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil. Okay, yeah, 24.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: It's all right, it's all right.
Matt: As you're keeping an eye out, the gleaming bright albino tiefling does seem to, at least, have caught the eye of a handful of humanoid-- it looks like humans, you see they're trailing behind you by a good hundred or so feet--
Marisha: They are following us?
Matt: -- but they appear to be following you. One appears to be a-- it looks dwarvish in how stout it is, but it's hard to tell at this distance, and the humanoid creature to the right of it is human-sized, but it is wrapped in a wreath of dark chains that seem to cover most features, the face and the torso. You can see bits of skin and muscle peeking through, but it's just an entire robe of very tightly-wound chains, just massed around its torso and legs and arms.
Laura: Ugh, this is like Hellraiser!
Taliesin: I was having a Hellraiser moment.
Liam: Perfectly healthy, perfectly normal.
Marisha: Does he seem to be following slightly behind in step of the dwarvish-maybe-creature?
Matt: They're staying in step with each other, but you--
Laura: Oh, it's a buddy movie!
Marisha: Yeah, buddy cop?
Liam: It's like Fox and the Hound.
Matt: But they're both very directly fixed and have been for a little while, on the white tiefling that has just walked by.
Liam: How far is this tavern from us?
Matt: When you notice it at this point, as you're walking actually forward, it's about 30 feet off.
Marisha: I come over the comms and I say, hey, Vaxy-poo, I think we're being followed, I kind of feel like they can smell you.
Liam: Me specifically?
Laura: Well, you are quite lovely, brother. Into the tavern? It's up ahead.
Taliesin: Into the tavern.
Marisha: Keep an eye out, it's like a kind of stout, maybe dwarvish man and a humanoid creature covered in chains.
Laura: I glance back and see them.
Liam: Thank you for the heads-up, I'm going to go in.
Laura: Yeah. I stand outside the tavern with Grog and wait for everybody to get inside.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I go stepping inside the tavern.
Marisha: I slip inside as well.
Matt: Okay, as you guys, and Taryon follows suit. "Ah, Doty, do whatever he does." He points to Grog. Doty steps next to you.
Liam: What a setup. (laughter)
Matt: As you guys enter, the low-burning, orangish-red glow of the interior shows you a slab slate floor. Across you see tables that are carved from similar deep obsidian bedrock-type material. The edges of them almost hook upward, and within the inside, you can see a handful of these similar spined devils, that you've seen as part of that procession earlier with the pit fiend, are sitting and ravenously feasting on some nondescript purplish-red meat. You can see the tables, actually, are almost like troughs, and the center of it seems to be almost a funnel, where all the blood and gore that is--
Laura: Ohh-- (shuddering noise)
Matt: -- sent out from the viscera that slurps past their toothy maw, is gathered and then siphoned down below.
Liam: Out of curiosity, these spined devils look like the thing we fought under Krieg's house. Was that Krieg's house? It was, wasn't it?
Laura: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
Liam: With the succubus.
Laura: Should we-- I just walk up. I'm just going to ask for a room, and just go up.
Matt: I can show pictures of all these creatures, it's great!
Taliesin: I'm going to stay downstairs to see if they try and come in.
Liam: Is there a bar here?
Travis: We're still outside.
Matt: There is the ones that are currently feasting at the one table there.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: Is there the hellish equivalent of a bar here?
Matt: You glance-- that's one table there; there's another table where you can see what looks to be a deep-red-skinned, very handsome-looking man who has black hair that fades to a very faint grey at the tips; it's long and goes past the shoulders. He has horns that protrude up the front, he's-- the rest of his body is swathed in dark black and grey cloak, and you can see wings folded against his back, and he just sits there, clutching a goblet at the table, usually staring into it as he occasionally sips, lost in his own thought. Beyond that, in the corner, you do see sitting--
Marisha: Me at 1 AM.
Matt: A rather rotund-- He's a greasy, obese-looking fella who's been-- he has a big and matted brown beard. His hair has this curl and he has a whole series of scratch marks across his face that just-- long, deep-set scars that leave this very marred visage, and he grins this toothy grin as you enter. You can see he's just-- his chest hair that's exposed under his white tunic, and his leather apron that he has over the front of that. It's just a very, very disturbing grin when he smiles at you as you enter, and he sits up from his stool and walks over and puts his hands down, and as it puts its hands down, you can see them begin to burn his skin but you can now see these calloused fingers-- you can see he's been here for quite some time and has had his own way of adjusting to the atmosphere, and just leans in, (speaks Infernal).
Laura: Kuthok.
Matt: "Kuthok."
Taliesin: Common?
Laura: Rooms.
Matt: "Ah, you aren't from around here. (laughs)"
Taliesin: Certainly not.
Marisha: Ermahgerd. Ermahgerd?
Taliesin: Ermahgod.
Marisha: Ermahgerd.
Matt: As you say that, the devilish entity that was sitting at the table slowly turns its head over towards her-- (laughter)
Matt: -- and has now taken an interest in this group that has entered--
Travis: Slick!
Matt: -- sipping his wine.
Marisha: I look back at him and I light up my fingers and I give him the flaming finger guns. Super douchey.
Matt: He gives a nod.
Marisha: Over-exaggerated nod.
Travis: He's literally eating raw meat and blood.
Laura: No more, Keyleth. No more eye contact.
Matt: Well, he just has a goblet, but you don't know what's in it.
Laura: Do you have rooms available?
Matt: "We can provide space, yes."
Taliesin: We're here on a few days' business and we were hoping to find a friendly place to rest our heads on occasion, maybe take in a meal of something not necessarily--
Laura: Organ?
Taliesin: Too conscious?
Marisha: Too conscious? (laughs)
Matt: He leans in and goes, "I can provide that, don't worry. How're you paying?"
Taliesin: Will coin suffice?
Matt: "I suppose."
Taliesin: If we get anything more exciting, we'll be sure to let you know. We just got here.
Matt: "One room," and he puts up a thick, meaty finger that you can see has-- it's been broken in two places and not healed right.
Taliesin: Oh god, stop it, Matt! Ugh.
Matt: "Three rooms, and a special meal for the lot. 250 gold."
Marisha: Wow, wow, vacation destination right here.
Taliesin: I'm totally okay with that.
Liam: Yeah, it's airport prices.
Travis: Let's be honest, it doesn't really matter what we think about that price.
Taliesin: You, sir, is that 250 a night or 250 total for our stay?
Matt: He gives you all a really dark look. "We'll say for the stay. A few days, you said, right?"
Taliesin: For that, 350 I think. I feel that I want you to know just how grateful we are. I'll put the extra 100 out of my personal bin.
Matt: You can see he's looking at you as you're saying this, and he's contemplating. You can see there's that urge to jack it up. But he keeps glancing past you occasionally and just nods and accepts it.
Marisha: Do I notice this?
Laura: As he's talking, I turn around and lean against the table that he's talking over and see who he's looking at.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Does that burn you?
Matt: You take five points of fire damage.
Laura: Well yeah, but I'm going to act totally calm about it.
Matt: You glance, watching his eyeline and you can see that same dark red-skinned devilish-looking man who was paying attention to you all is currently meeting his gaze directly and gives him a nod.
Marisha: Oh, no no no! This ain't no Hostel situation! Aw, hell no.
Laura: I think he might be the owner.
Marisha: That makes sense-- but still, still, no. No, we're not going to go in here to be sold in the middle of the night.
Taliesin: We're good, we're good.
Marisha: Are we cool?
Taliesin: I think we're cool. Just let it play out.
Laura: Can we insight check the guy we're talking to?
Matt: Sure, go for it.
Laura: Okay. Sure, why not! Here we go. Yeah, yeah that's good. 17.
Matt: 17? I mean, he's hard to read, but he seems to be a pretty fucking creepy guy who's giving you rooms to stay in, and seems to be making eye contact and his reactions based on some sort of unspoken conversation with this other entity in the room with you. But he reaches down without breaking eye contact with the rest of you as well and puts a set of three keys onto the table. They're all these ragged-looking black iron constructs that are identical in some ways but their handcrafted visual style shows that they have different slight changes to their designs. Kind of shoves them forward towards you. "Premium." And he reaches down. You hear the clanking of some sort of glass-like instruments and he pulls up these small, almost dull gray-looking sponge-like stones that are about that large. Kind of puts one out in front of each of you. Takes the coins. (sighs) Goes and walks back--
Laura: Wait, before he walks away. How long have you owned this space?
Matt: "Oh, I don't own it. I just work here."
Laura: Who runs it, then?
Matt: "Why you asking so many questions, girl?"
Laura: I'm curious, big man. That's all.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: (squeaking noises) 18.
Liam: She said with confidence.
Matt: "That's on a need-to-know basis, sweetheart. Enjoy your meal." He goes and like sweatily waddles over to his chair in the corner and sits down.
Marisha: Is this rock tartare? Oh my god. We used to serve this all the time in the Air Ashari. It was a delicacy in the Earth Ashari.
Matt: As you lift it and bring it towards you, it seems to have this very, very faint energy around it.
Marisha: Oh, I don't know if this is rock crudite.
Laura: Let's get up to the rooms. I want Tary to identify it once we get up to the rooms.
Marisha: I kind of do like a--
Laura: Don't, don't. Not yet, Keyleth.
Matt: Keyleth, as you tap it and bring it towards your mouth, you guys watch as it glows with a faint pale yellow-green color and, Keyleth, you hear this faint soft, wailing sound as this slight drift of soul energy drifts off of the stone and is inhaled by Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh.
Travis: Oh! (laughs)
Matt: Keyleth, you feel a sudden rush--
Travis: Of course!
Matt: An unexpected rush of energy. Your vision clarifies--
Liam: Give it to Keyleth, she'll try anything! (laughter)
Laura: You ate a soul, Keyleth?!
Taliesin: That had a name! That had a life, that had a mortgage.
Laura: Oh my god!
Taliesin: He made some bad decisions, and now you're eating it--
Matt: A sudden rush of energy--
Marisha: It's so Keyleth, yeah. Oh shit.
Taliesin: I'm so proud of you.
Matt: You feel very awake. Your senses clarify and like a boundless surge of energy in your body, like you could do anything.
Marisha: (exhales) Do we-- are we resting right now? Let's go right now.
Laura: Let's go up to the room.
Liam: You okay over there?
Marisha: This is like the best rock tartare I think I've ever experienced.
Matt: Tary, by the way, goes--
Laura: No, no, Tary!
Matt: Like sucking hard on the stone. And you watch as the hairs on the back of his neck stand and he goes, "Good sir. How much are each of these?"
Travis: Yeah, yeah.
Liam: I'm quietly thinking about Scanlan, watching this happen.
Matt: The guy sits forward and goes, "For you? 30 gold apiece."
Marisha: Taryon--
Matt: Tary goes, "I'll take 20."
Marisha: Buy the lot, Tary! Buy the lot! Good man! And I like Beastman shake him. Yeah!
Liam: Are you okay?
Marisha: I'm great! I feel great.
Laura: Let's go upstairs.
Travis: We got one left, let's take it upstairs.
Laura: No, we've got one for each of us.
Travis: He said three of them.
Taliesin: Three rooms.
Matt: So Sam, mark 600 gold and wherever you are, Sam, mark down 20 soul stone slivers.
Liam: Welcome to Hollywood.
Marisha: They're soul stone slivers?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: That's what they're fucking called? That's some-- man. You need to put a disclaimer on those.
Liam: Let's get to the rooms, shall we?
Taliesin: This is everything I wanted. Yeah, let's go to the rooms.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way up to the chambers, and to your surprise, the interior of these rooms are fairly well furnished. While the entrance chamber seemed to be pretty brutal, the chambers that you were given-- they aren't next to each other. They're a little scattered as far as the rooms. Only maybe ten or so rooms in the whole establishment. But each room has a very well-crafted bed. There appear to be some well-made chairs of a similar stone material of the downstairs setup there, all having this weird, jagged stylings to their construct. The chamber's still hot as fuck, and it is an uncomfortable interior, but the bed itself does not appear to be bursting into flames. The material here is seemingly resistant to the heat in which it's in the proximity of.
Liam: No, it's just a bed in New York City in July.
Laura: I open up the bag of colding and just like put my face next to it.
Taliesin: Don't fall in.
Laura: No, I just want to breathe in the cold.
Taliesin: Don't lick it, either.
Laura: Wait, should we all go to one room, then?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: And I want to look all around the room and see if anybody's watching, if there's any kind of holes in the wall.
Liam: Yeah, is there any kind of bugs or any-- bugs.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Bugs or bugs. I cast black light.
Marisha: Bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs-- I cast black light!
Laura: 13.
Liam: 18.
Matt: Cool. So as you guys take a good ten minutes or so. As you're looking over the room, everyone's Alter Selves except for Keyleth's fade.
Laura: Yeah, we were close there.
Matt: You guys were very close. But you glance around the room and it seems safe. You don't see any sort of signs of any spying.
Marisha: Tary. You look like yourself again.
Matt: "Oh, I'm about to feel a lot more like myself here in a second." And he starts going through the--
Laura: Not yet. Just hold on one second. Maybe I'd cast Identify on those, just before you eat another one.
Travis: Oh yeah.
Matt: "Oh, right!"
Marisha: Tary. Tary. There are beds. And Keyleth goes and jumps up on a bed, and just starts jumping on them a little.
Matt: Tary goes like-- leans into you and goes like, "Is she hitting on me?"
Marisha: As Keyleth jumps in the bed on the background.
Liam: It's hard to tell sometimes. Just go with it. Don't make any sudden movements, and let her get it out of her system.
Matt: "Right, right."
Marisha: Mattresses are springy here!
Laura: Wow.
Liam: What's the D&D equivalent of a glowstick?
Matt: It'd be a Sunrod.
Taliesin: That's actually true.
Matt: That is actually true. (laughs)
Taliesin: I'm going to gently pop her in the ankle to see if I can get her to just fall onto the bed and stop hopping.
Matt: (falling and slamming noise) Percy just knocks you onto your ass.
Laura: Okay, Keyleth, okay.
Matt: By the way, the buzz, if you will, the rush slowly begins to fade over the next minute or so. Taryon finishes his Identification and goes, "Huh. Apparently these are receptacles to contain a fragment of refined soul."
Marisha: What?!
Matt: "Yeah, these were once living people. I'm going to be sick."
Liam: I start giving Keyleth--
Laura: (laughs) You just ate a person! You just ate people.
Matt: "I know. I kn-- (nervous noises)"
Marisha: I go with Taryon to puke.
Liam: Ooh, never mind. I was going to give her a scalp massage, but ugh.
Taliesin: So does the Identification spell actually tell you the name of the person that you were consuming?
Matt: "Nope! And I'm glad! I don't want to-- I didn't-- I don't-- I'm sure they were a terrible person. If they're here they're probably a terrible person. They're probably terrible people, right?!"
Travis: How many souls did you just buy?
Matt: "I don't know!"
Laura: (gasps) Well, it was fragments, so maybe it's only like five souls, completely?
Matt: "Maybe? I don't know the logistics."
Travis: Like a whole family.
Liam: I mean, you were really up, though, when you were, you know, full there.
Laura: But does it heal you? What do the fragments do? I mean do the soul fragments just like--
Marisha: Yeah, what happened? What happened when that happened?
Laura: -- do you just feel better, are you healed or are you just not hungry anymore?
Taliesin: Sustained.
Matt: Sustained. I mean, as far you understand, and from what you experienced there, any sort of hunger pains that would have existed there seem to have been staved off, and there is a--
Taliesin: (laughs) It's literally Soylent.
Marisha: That's really messed up, because now I'm hungry. (laughter)
Marisha: It's very hollow sustenance, I'm really hungry now.
Laura: Well, we're about to have a Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: Oh boy.
Travis: Back to the plan.
Laura: Back to the plan.
Marisha: Oh god, my throat's a little tight.
Taliesin: Scry. You're going to be fine after you scry.
Laura: Okay, scry. Let's scry on Hotis.
Travis: And then the Feast?
Taliesin: I'm going to give her a shot of something, just to calm down.
Marisha: Yeah, can you give me like, a minute?
Taliesin: Going to give her a shot of something. Got to go back for more, soon.
Liam: Pours a soul in.
Taliesin: (laughs) Certainly spirits at the very least. Soul and spirits. I shouldn't be finding this as funny as I am.
Liam: Oh, it's very in-character.
Marisha: Keyleth paces back and forth for about five minutes, and then goes, okay, I'm good.
Laura: Let it settle.
Marisha: I'm great. Okay.
Laura: Grog, do you want to keep leaning against the door, maybe? I'm just afraid-- I feel really uncomfortable in here. Are there windows in the room at all?
Matt: Nope.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Can I touch the door with my pointy finger real quick?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Travis: Is it burny?
Matt: It is.
Laura: Maybe Doty can lean against the door? Stand in front of the--
Liam: Hey yeah, Tarytown, can you have Dotes lean on the door?
Matt: Which, by the way, as Grog does that, Doty goes-- into the door, and Taryon's like, "Oh, Doty, you can stop doing that, but do lean against the door."
Laura: Does he take fire damage?
Matt: Doesn't appear to be affecting him.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Though, over the next minute or so, you see parts of the back of his armor begin to glow a dull red to match the coloration of the edges of the buildings.
Laura: Oh shit, that's kind of cool.
Marisha: That's pretty cool, yeah.
Laura: Don't touch Doty!
Matt: It's my favourite board game.
All: Don't. Touch. Doty!
Matt: Waiting for it.
Liam: Seems like a Catholic school game. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so, what are you doing?
Travis: Oh my god.
Laura: Oh no. We're going to scry on Hotis.
Marisha: We're going to scry on Hotis. I'm going to scry, using my 5th-level spell, not the Scrying Eye because I want to use my spell ability, and it's going to be awesome, and I'm not going to be hiding from a soul that I accidentally consumed.
Liam: No, you're going to be bottoming out.
Matt: Okay, hold on just a second.
Liam: Just need another soul, man.
Marisha: Let's add to Keyleth's guilt a little bit more.
Laura: It's okay, it was already dead, Keyleth. Or maybe it was like the soul gems.
Travis: Yep, that thing was still alive.
Marisha: Don't say any of that. I've got to focus.
Laura: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm kidding, kidding, I'm totally kidding.
Liam: Here-- I'm sure it was somebody who murdered children, you know? It was probably a major arsehole.
Laura: Yeah, it was probably a really bad person, and now they're inside of you.
Marisha: You know, not something else I'd want right now, no. None of these things.
Matt: What level spell is the scry?
Marisha: Fifth.
Matt: Fifth? As soon as you cast the spell and center your vision on the idea of Hotis, the spell immediately fizzles and dissipates.
Liam: Son of a--
Marisha: Son of a-- god--
Matt: And you begin to remember, through your research of the rakshasa, up to a certain level of spells, 6th-level spells, they're immune to it.
Marisha: Damn it to the Nine-- or Second Layer of Hell. All right.
Laura: So, cast it at a higher level.
Marisha: So, I'm going to try again.
Laura: At what level?
Marisha: I'm going to-- we're in for the night, yeah?
Laura: We can be.
Liam: That's the plan. That's the intention.
Marisha: We're going to eat a Heroes' Feast.
Liam: All topped off at the moment, so whatever you do, we'll make up.
Laura: Do we know if the Nine Hells have day and night the same way--
Travis: I'm not topped off; I need four hit points.
Liam: I touch Grog's shoulder and I give him four hit points.
Matt: And, just like that--
Travis: Thank you.
Liam: Ticklish.
Matt: Yeah, a little bit.
Laura: Does this place have day and night the same way?
Marisha: We'll be eating a Heroes' Feast, correct?
Laura: Yeah, but are we going to scry first?
Marisha: Yeah!
Laura: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Marisha: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! I'm going to do an 8th-level Scry.
Matt: An 8th-level Scrying?
Marisha: On Hotis.
Laura: Shit!
Matt: Okay!
Liam: Boom!
Laura: Eat it, Hotis!
Marisha: Show me what you got!
Taliesin: Show me what you got!
Liam: Ho-dis!
Laura: Eat that scry!
Travis: He's rolling.
Laura: Oh god, he is.
Matt: This time, you grit your teeth. The space is already prepared for the first ritual you did.
Marisha: I also give it a good ten minutes, let him get distracted and forget that he, maybe, just got scryed on.
Matt: Okay! You close your eyes, and this time, remembering both the original conflicts with him in the Quad Roads, the battle, which you recall was at the base of a statue of Dispater, the archdevil of this sphere of Hell.
Marisha: Oh fuck, no.
Matt: Way back when. You remember him falling off the top of the balcony with Vax--
Liam: Good times.
Laura: And then being stabbed by Scanlan.
Matt: -- and using these memories, you focus on the essence of Hotis. Your vision suddenly pulls out of the top of this chamber that you're in, to a brief glance, just a flash over the horizon of the city, and there you see the ominous dark tower, for but a moment. Then there's a flash as your vision is pulled further into this cityscape of darkened, withering alleys, and the whole atmosphere as the core of this space that you guys are heading towards seems to be disheveled, ruined, destitute, and filthy. Your vision is dragged in that direction, to ground level, then below, and is brought, suddenly thrust into chambers, dark, bars, iron doors, a prison. A prison beneath the streets of the city. There's another flash. You see devils, dozens of them, walking guards, some larger than others. You see a flash of large, red leathery wings. You see something horned and dark, grinning beyond a metal door, and then beyond that door, there's another flash, and on the inside, you see tendrils of red flesh extending from the ceilings and the walls, all merging to a center small core. There you see this fleshy egg-like structure, about this large, that is suspended by these strands of muscle-y sinew, and there you see writhing and twisting within the membrane of this, a small, misshapen humanoid cat-like creature that is currently writhing on the inside. You can hear the faint squealing and screaming--
Laura: (high-pitched) Rakshasa!
Matt: -- in pain as Hotis, not yet fully formed, slowly torturing its way back to its full physical form, is just screaming with hatred, awaiting the moments of vengeance once the torturous pain that currently consumes its existence fades and it can once more plot its return to the Prime Material Plane.
Marisha: But it was in a prison underground, under the tower?
Liam: In a Faberge egg.
Matt: Underneath this portion of the city, or a little ways ahead.
Taliesin: Suspended by octopi.
Marisha: Holy fuck!
Taliesin: This is going to go great!
Marisha: Holy shit!
Laura: Anything else? Anything else? Anything else? Did you see anything else?
Matt: That's all you see. You just saw flashes just leading into this. You have no idea exactly where it is. All you saw were flashes of a prison under the city, and Hotis still incubating in this chamber.
Travis: We've got to get arrested.
Laura: Or become police officers.
Liam: Yeah! Police Academy, that's the thing the do!
Travis: Keyleth will get arrested, no problem.
Marisha: Yeah, that's true. Just tell me to go do something in public. That's all you need. All right. So, I'm remembering, it seems like Hotis might serve the devil of this realm, the leader, the president, as you have said a few times, Grog.
Travis: Dispator.
Marisha: Mm-hm, Dispator. Seems like he serves him, and is in a prison. You know what's fun, I feel like a lot of the things we were looking for this whole time are all underground. It's like an underground city. Man, this is terrifying.
Taliesin: What if that means it's just as hot underground?
Marisha: (exhales) Well, the good news is, once we find Hotis, it'll be super easy. The bad news is, finding Hotis? Super hard.
Liam: Gotta find out-- I assume she's-- you've filled us all in on what you saw.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm assuming I translated.
Taliesin: So all we have to do is teleport through that tree that's underground. We can send him a small bonsai tree, as a gift.
Marisha: (gasps) Oh my god, oh my god!
Laura: Yeah yeah yeah, then as soon as he wakes up--
Liam: We have to find the prison--
Taliesin: We have to find the prison, find out what it is, who runs it--
Liam: And then get in, get arrested, get--
Taliesin: Infiltrate, perhaps. Call a favor.
Marisha: I have a weird feeling that this prison is run by Dis-- Lord Dispater himself.
Liam: James Spader.
Marisha: James Spader.
Travis: Wait, you said it wasn't fully formed, right? It's still, like, in its goo phase?
Marisha: It is.
Travis: Am I the only one that feels like this is an awful lot of trouble for something that's not a problem yet?
Taliesin: The trouble is, once it becomes a problem, it continues to be a problem until you cut it off at the root.
Laura: He only stops when you kill him down here.
Liam: Right, Grog, it's two different sets of problems. Here, he's a wee, wee bab in a chocolate egg, but getting to him is difficult. If we wait, then he gets the jump on us when we're sleeping in our beds.
Travis: Not in a chocolate egg?
Liam: Not in a chocolate egg. Then he looks like a guy in a mascot suit at a Winter's Crest fair.
Laura: Or like Gilmore.
Marisha: Or like Keyleth.
Taliesin: Or like Pike.
Laura: Oh, I can't even imagine Hotis disguised as Pike.
Marisha: I know, what a dick move that would be.
Liam: So, it's now or later, it's just a different set of problems, and now we know what we're doing at least.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: So--
Taliesin: I may-- well, I'm tempted to head downstairs to have a drink, start scoping out and see who might know what's what about that prison.
Liam: I mean, we know fucking nobody in this city.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: And they all look like garbage, so why don't we just start with the garbage downstairs?
Travis: Small question  we checked in as-- you checked in as tieflings.
Laura: Yeah. We have to re-alter ourselves before we go downstairs.
Travis: For bursts of an hour, each time?
Taliesin: Or we could just not talk about it and see if anyone actually notices, just see if anyone's going to be rude about it.
Travis: There's only a few rooms in this place, right?
Marisha: They keep a fairly close eye on their patrons.
Travis: I would think so-- ol' broken sausage finger may be sharper than we think.
Marisha: Hmm, I have a feeling there are more eyes on us here than we even realise.
Laura: Oh, I'm sure.
Travis: Hey, I'm really hungry, can we have that fucking Feast now?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, and I make a Heroes' Feast.
Matt: All righty. You guys go ahead and muster the Heroes' Feast.
Laura: I mark off 1,000 gold.
Liam: Extra hit points, no fear.
Marisha: Yep.
Liam: Lustrous hair.
Taliesin: Shiny fingernails.
Liam: Shiny fingernails. Feel like you ate a soul.
Laura: Does that mean all of our heal-- our points are healed, or are we just--
Matt: Well, if you guys take a full rest, you will.
Laura: Oh. Oh, that's the question I wanted to ask you: did we know if here, night and day is the same?
Matt: You don't know that.
Laura: No, that wasn't in any of his books?
Matt: Make an intelligence check, actually.
Taliesin: That's 12.
Matt: You really have no idea. I mean, there are beds, there are places to stay, and from what you can tell, there are-- there is traffic from creatures that travel from different planes, probably require sleep. So, whether or not there is a day-night cycle based on any sort of improbable sun, there probably are expected day-sleep cycles for creatures that need to sleep.
Travis: They pump oxygen in, you can stay up as late as you want.
Matt: Yeah, it's fine.
Marisha: No windows.
Matt: So Keyleth, roll 2d10.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: I'm so excited.
Travis: Come on, now.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies! That's an eight for one, and the other, not as good. Ten total.
Matt: Okay, so everyone gets a bonus of ten-- that's an average, I guess. Close to average. So, ten maximum hit point increase to everybody for the next 24 hours.
Marisha: I also, at the end of dinner say, I would like to raise a toast. To Vox Machina: for going and being together all the way into hell and back.
Laura: Well, fingers crossed.
Liam: Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Travis: We might not come back.
Marisha: Well, all the way to Hell and--
Taliesin: To hell!
Travis: Here.
Matt: "Thanks to the wonderful guidance of the Voice of the Tempest!"
Laura: Okay.
Travis: (sighs) Oh Tary.
Marisha: Oh jeez.
Matt: "Keyleth of the Air Ashari and-- keep writing this down-- and to the majesty and the heroic and adventurous drive--"
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: "Of Taryon Darrington!"
Marisha: Of Tary-- Everybody, to Taryon Darrington!
Matt: "To me!"
Marisha: And with that, I do Inspiring Leader, my newest feat since I'm a leader. (laughter)
Taliesin: What voice is this?
Marisha: Mine.
Taliesin: This is your "Leader" voice.
Marisha: This is why I'm a voice actor. And--
Matt: So you cheer and talk for about ten minutes.
Marisha: Yes, cheers to Taryon Darrington and his glistening armor and his flowing locks of golden hair. And I continue for ten minutes about Taryon Darrington.
Laura: Wow.
Marisha: And his glistening boots of shining upkeep. And his--
Travis: He's losing hit points from this.
Laura: I want to throw up.
Matt: And the whole time Doty's--
Marisha: Writing it all down. And then I give temporary hit points equal to my level, which is 17, plus my charisma modifier, which is nothing. So you get an extra 17 on that ten.
Matt: That's temporary, though.
Marisha: Temporary.
Laura: Why are we inspired by hearing you talk all that shit about Tary?
Liam: Because it's in the spellbook.
Laura: I don't feel inspired.
Marisha: Well, because I would hope that with my, you know, Tary's golden locks of flowing hair and with my very impressive cape that I got, you know, for touring the world. Like a frequent flyer card.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of this, Taryon got 17 temporary hit points. (laughter)
Marisha: What?! No! You know what, Vex, I'm still, I'm still practicing.
Laura: You know what? It's getting there. Next time, share the compliments, make all of us feel cool.
Liam: And all this while, Vax has been staring at Taryon and imagining him with exactly half a beard. (laughter)
Matt: While Taryon notices you staring intently and she's giving this inspiring speech about how amazing he is-- Taryon looks over at you and goes, "She's hitting on me." (laughter)
Marisha: With his belt that is bejeweled and his very bedazzled pauldrons and his--
Laura: So over this part.
Marisha: Very, very manicured cuticles. And I don't know what else to say for ten minutes about Tary.
Travis: Are we staying in? For the, for a bit?
Taliesin: On the plus side, we're all very tired now.
Liam: What else is there to say about Taryon Darrington?
Marisha: Don't ask me. Please don't ask me.
Matt: What are you guys doing? Are you resting?
Laura: I don't know. Should we? Rest? I don't even know what time it is here.
Matt: You don't.
Laura: It could be like early morning and we could rest and then wake up in the middle of the night.
Travis: We've only been traveling for like a few hours, right?
Laura: But it could be a completely different time here!
Matt: Yeah. But it's more about your internal clock, whatever you want to do.
Taliesin: It took us quite a while to find this place.
Marisha: I've also expended my 6th, 7th and 8th-level spells.
Matt: It took an hour, a little over an hour since your arrival. Since you guys did your transformations.
Liam: Yeah. We went to bed, got up, and then-- what was that?
Laura: Oh, that was a burp. I forgot we were filming. (laughs)
Matt: Yeah. You've had maybe three hours, four hours since waking up in the morning.
Liam: It's like noon in our internal clock, probably.
Laura: I feel like we should just fucking try to do something.
Travis: Yeah, so if we've got to find our way to some sort of prison, two options. Get arrested. Or ask people where people go who get arrested, which seems really fishy and stupid.
Marisha: It seemed like it was underground, almost spanning this entire city. We could possibly try and find a back entrance. I don't know.
Liam: We need to talk to somebody. Just talk to somebody. We can walk around for another two hours and wait until somebody gets the heebie-jeebies from us and fucks us up. Or we can talk to somebody. I'm going to talk to somebody. (laughter)
Laura: Well, there's the owner downstairs, the creepy guy.
Liam: I've already left the room.
Laura: Oh, Jesus.
Taliesin: I follow him.
Laura: I follow. Wait! We're not altered!
Marisha: No, you're not.
Taliesin: No. He already went down.
Marisha: You want to come back-- Vax, Vax, Vax, Vax!
Liam: Yeah?
Marisha: You're not altered! You're not altered! Hey! Hey!
Liam: I do a quick U-turn.
Taliesin: All right, we grab him, drag him back in.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: At which, as Tary goes, "All right, Doty. Let him through," as you leave, Doty kind of moves away from the door and lets you by. As he bends forward with kind of the taut gesture of bowing as you pass by, you see his entire back is glowing bright red. (laughter)
Laura: Tary, can he heat up to the point that he doesn't work any more?
Matt: "I hope not. Probably not. I'm going to say not."
Laura: You made him, after all. You would know.
Matt: "Right. It's fine." He looks over to Percival. "Right? He's going to be fine?"
Taliesin: Maybe flip? Flip sides, just keep flipping the sides.
Matt: "Right! All right, Doty  chest against the wall." And Doty just kind of pancakes against the door a second time.
Travis: I wish I had some bacon right now.
Laura: Tary?
Matt: "Mm-hm?"
Laura: Can you Alter Self again, on us?
Matt: Let's see, I'm going to check the character sheet that I got sent.
Liam: You're god, you can do anything.
Laura: If we're screwed, we might have to be us.
Taliesin: We might have to.
Matt: Well, he can cast Alter Self, he goes, "I can technically do it one more time."
Laura: But you'll be out of other things you can do?
Matt: "I will be out of all my things. Of the big things. I mean, I still can--" He kind of jostles a satchel he has on the side, you hear a bunch of glass and things clinking. He says, "I still have my accoutrements. But as far my devices to help you guys out, I'm kind of spent at that point. But--"
Travis: You know, I still look the way I did when I checked in. Looking like me going to go and do all the recon.
Marisha: I can do Alter Self at will, I'm just not the best person to talk to people.
Matt: "Why don't we let the two of them go?"
Taliesin: (inhales nervously)
Laura: Oh god.
Marisha: Are you? Is that Grog and Keyleth?
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Grog and Keyleth. Haven't done it for a while. Grog and Minxie. (laughs nervously)
Travis: What? You and I, me and the tiger?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm not saying I'd be a tiger. I'm just hearkening back to our team-up.
Travis: But you said Minxie.
Liam: Yeah but, I mean, I haven't stepped in lava in a while. Doesn't mean that's something I should right now.
Marisha: Well, you know, it's what we call a call-back? You know, don't worry about it.
Taliesin: It's, you know, what's-- No, I don't want to say what's the worst that could happen. What's the best could happen? What's the best outcome here?
Liam: I feel like with Scanlan gone, our best talker is this one.
Taliesin: Yes. Probably the two of us, possibly.
Travis: Where are you pointing, over here? I can't see.
Taliesin: Yes. Grog.
Travis: I've got a head of hair in the way. Where'd you point?
Marisha: You know, Grog and I can be very intimidating. Right, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, but it's more angry.
Laura: You know, he might do great here. I haven't been doing so hot.
Liam: Yeah, but you know, I feel like in so many situations we go: "What happens if I push this button? Let's just see what happens."
Laura: Let's just send Grog down.
Liam: But that's not what I'm saying. I'm actually arguing the opposite of that. I'm saying for once, maybe, I mean, you're a very good talker. Why don't we send the person who's good at talking down? Instead of on a lark, sending down, you know, the brute to talk.
Laura: Yeah, but everything I've tried hasn't worked so far. Maybe they're immune to persuasion down here and maybe all they need is a little (grunts) a little jostle.
Liam: Maybe you haven't been lucky. Maybe you need to give it another shot. I mean, your average is a little bit better than the Big Man's.
Marisha: Yeah. We could go back to old-school days and I could always go Minxie. Little intimidation check?
Travis: They're going to want to steal you and put you in a cage.
Taliesin: I'm perfectly content to just go down there, and if anyone asks we've just changed into something more comfortable.
Laura: Let's just fucking go.
Taliesin: Let's go.
Liam: Both of you! You're both-- he can only do one person.
Marisha: Yeah. Are going to change into something? Or are you just going to be totally oblivious that you're definitely not the people who walked in upstairs?
Taliesin: I'm going to be totally okay.
Matt: "I have one capsule."
Laura: We're going to be okay. He says he's got enough for everyone still.
Liam: He's only got enough for one.
Laura: No, he can do it again to all of us.
Matt: "I can do it to one person"
Liam: One person.
Travis: Yeah, and I go down as just backup.
Laura: It's up to you, Percy, dear.
Marisha: And I can do it at will.
Liam: You go, you go.
Taliesin: I don't think I-- do you think with the capsule or without. I don't want to--
Laura: With.
Taliesin: Fine, with.
Marisha: Oh, jeez. Someone pick who goes down and talks. I feel like Grog.
Liam: I just did. Percival, you're going. It's hell, this is your game now.
Laura: With Grog. You're going with Grog.
Liam: Sure, as back-up, yes.
Matt: "Be my guest."
Marisha: Percy and Grog! Go, go, go, go!
Matt: All right, so as you take the coin and you kind of focus on it (fwoosh) and your form shifts back into the previous tiefling appearance.
Taliesin: I grab a soul shard, I suck it down. (sniffs)
Laura: Have fun storming the castle.
Taliesin: Oh, let's do this.
Travis: Oh, you did a rail of soul, huh? Okay. Sweet!
Liam: He just-- (mimics snorting cocaine)
Taliesin: And we head down.
Laura: Did he really? Did you take soul?
Travis: He did! He's so causal, he was like, (inhales, then roars) (laughter)
Taliesin: (inhales) Let's do this. Sucked it down like an oyster.
Matt: And as the rush hits you, you take a step and pause for a moment, because the rush is strong and familiar. It's similar to the sensation and the rush you had when you took a life with the Pepperbox when Orthax was still holding sway.
Taliesin: Huh.
Travis: Oh no.
Matt: That same passage of some sort of a soul energy, and as the rush hits, that familiarity itches you on the inside, and you're a little caught off-guard and made uncomfortable by it.
Liam: Steady as she goes, Percival.
Marisha: Too much?
Taliesin: Too much.
Marisha: Little much?
Taliesin: Little much.
Marisha: Little overwhelming?
Taliesin: Yes, little bit.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to be meditating upon that a little bit later. Let's head downstairs.
Laura: Come back, please.
Liam: I place my hands on Grog's shoulder and Percival's shoulder and cast Bless as they walk out the door.
Matt: Okay. You guys head out, into the hallway.
Laura: I smack both their asses.
Matt: (smack noise)
Liam: You dive in front of me to do that?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: (laughs) And Taryon goes, (inhales deeply). (laughs) He gets weirdly uncomfortable. All right, so, you guys head back downstairs. The two devils that were there feasting earlier appear to have left, and the room is mostly quiet and empty now, except for the same rough-looking bartender in the corner and there, at the same table, is the red-skinned, devilish, handsome gentleman. As you walk down, you see what appears to be a small impish creature that's on his shoulder, and he's currently conversing with it quietly, and then as you guys step down, he (waving noise) to it, and it flies up, and skitters off into the distance outside of the door. Turns to you, reaches over and takes a bottle off the table and fills the goblet.
Travis: What comes out of the bottle?
Matt: It appears to be some deep red liquid.
Laura: Ugh.
Liam: It's merlot.
Laura: Oh. Yum.
Matt: He's watching you, but he's not expecting any interface.
Taliesin: I walk over. (clears throat) Could I possibly entertain you with some company?
Matt: "It would-- it would be a change of pace that is quite welcome. Take a seat, both of you."
Travis: Okay.
Matt: The seats, as they-- they're heavy and they're not quite as-- they're heated at the base, they're warm to the touch, but they're not burning you. You both pull them up and they grind against the slate stone floor of the interior as you plop down and sit. "Shall I also fetch you a drink?"
Taliesin: That sounds lovely. What is actually available at this hour at this establishment?
Matt: "Available at the establishment, not this kind of drink. My personal reserve, that I can offer."
Taliesin: I would be curious, I would hate to be indebted to you at this point, but I would be very curious to try whatever it is that you consider to be your personal stash.
Matt: "I would prefer you indebted to me."
Marisha: Jesus.
Matt: And he lifts a finger and the gentleman at the far edge of the bar stirs, "(grunts) Oh, right." and Chris Farleys his pants a bit. (laughter)
Matt: Comes over with two similar goblets and places them on the table, and steps back to the corner. The gentleman takes the bottle and fills them both, kind of finishing the last bit he had in Grog's chalice, and sets it to the side.
Taliesin: What may I call you?
Matt: "You may call me Ipkesh. What may I call you?"
Taliesin: Ah, Freddie will do for now.
Matt: "Freddie?"
Travis: Greg.
Matt: "Freddie and Greg?" (laughs) God damn it!
Taliesin: Broke the DM, ten points. Boom! (laughter)
Taliesin: Fuck souls, that's a rush.
Liam: Two points for Gryffindor.
Marisha: Oh man, buddy cop, go!
Matt: "So what brings you to my fine establishment?"
Travis: What does the chalice smell like?
Matt: Smells like a strong, alcoholic wine of some kind.
Travis: I take a big old sip.
Matt: It's good. It's very good. You're not a big fan of wine, generally, because you're more of a liquor and ale person, but as far as the wines you've had, it's pretty good.
Liam: Your pancreas melts.
Travis: This, I'm sure you know, is really good.
Matt: "It better be. So, what is your business?"
Taliesin: Honestly, cards on the table, we're in town because a friend of ours got in badly with a rakshasa.
Matt: "(chuckles) This is not an unfamiliar tale."
Taliesin: We figured not, and we're definitely out of place, a bit out of sorts, and definitely out of our depths, but thank you for the rooms. I assume this is your establishment, is it not?
Matt: "I run it at the-- how do I say? A partnership with my betters."
Taliesin: I think I understand. Take another sip. Ah, well, regardless of betters or otherwise, I'm grateful for the sanctuary. All of us are. So we, I assume, are not the first people you've met coming into town, looking for a rakshasa?
Matt: "I have not met them, but stories do swirl, and find my ears. It does all of us well here to know what's going on."
Taliesin: Well, I will admit, we have some questions.
Matt: "Well, perhaps I have some answers."
Taliesin: We've heard of a-- would you call it a prison? An underground series of cells, beneath the tower? Beneath the tower, beneath the city. That's where we think we might find our boy.
Matt: "There is a prison here, yes. I know it well."
Taliesin: You know it well, I would hope not from personal experience?
Matt: "Oh, no, no. It imprisons many things, but-- I would be blunt with you as well. We live here under the interest of business, yes?"
Taliesin: I understand.
Matt: "Information is a resource."
Taliesin: A very, very great one. There is a prison, underground, people go there. Perhaps this is an easy question to ask that will flow freewy-- freely. What is this? Why do people get sent to that prison?
Matt: "What do you have to offer for my information?"
Taliesin: What are you in the market for? I have dull things, but I get the distinct impression you're not necessarily somebody who's going to be interested in coin?
Matt: "I prefer not to dole out small tidbits. I prefer to bundle in larger packages."
Taliesin: I understand. How do I know that what you have to offer is worthwhile?
Matt: "I can--"
Taliesin: I have a proposal.
Matt: "Hm, tempt me."
Taliesin: Obviously we're interested in the prison. We're interested in somehow getting into the prison, or possibly getting our problem out of the prison. I'm not saying that we're looking for some sort of grand mastermind or otherwise, but if you feel that you're the sort of person that would have enough information in this direction of how one might get access to the prison or otherwise, and get out with their skin intact-- at least most of it-- or the sorts of people who would be interested in helping such an adventure go forward, that would be worth our while and interesting.
Matt: Brings up a hand and snaps his finger. As it does, the entire room around both of you goes dark. Jet black. You still see the table before you, the drinks in your hand, the gentleman across the way, but everything else around you just goes complete, lightless, umbra expanse.
Travis: I had too much of this wine.
Taliesin: I don't think I've had enough.
Matt: "If we're to speak freely, it's best that we speak in a place that is safe to speak."
Marisha: Oh my god. He fucking teleported you guys away somewhere.
Matt: "My cost for my information is high, but I can both give you what you seek and the means of achieving what you want, but I want a favor in trade."
Taliesin: And I hope-- If you're willing, that if we decline your offer, I hope you will take no offense.
Matt: "I will take no offense, but those that listen might."
Taliesin: That's fair.
Matt: "What I'm trying to say is, it behooves you to make this contract. So. What you seek is the Mentiri. The Mentiri is the prison beneath the city. I can tell you more, I can get you there. I can probably even find out who there knows of or is involved with this rakshasa. And this favor I ask will lead you to this path." He leans forward after taking a big sip of his wine, finishing the last of it, setting it aside with a heavy (poof) on the table. "I work for Utugash, one of the prominent owners and taskmasters involved in moving souls and soul goods throughout this area of Dis. He is slovenly, he is lazy, he is powerful, and he needs to fall."
Taliesin: Is he a pit fiend?
Matt: "At one time, maybe. At this time, his laziness has left him a useless sack of demon shit, and I have bent under his fist and brow for far too long. I have friends now in other places, and if his business were to crumble, that void left behind could elevate me and my compatriots."
Taliesin: Of course.
Matt: "Now, I have friends in this prison, and the offense of travelers tearing down someone of prominence, and yourselves being still within your very mortal coils, why that's what this prison is designed for; for those that break the laws of the land but haven't yet passed. To be ripened. To be kept, until they do, once the corruption has set them for the rest of our factory. So, you slay this creature, I can see that you are safely arrested and placed with allies on the inside that could move you around and bring you fairly close to this rakshasa you seek. That is my offer."
Taliesin: This is a fair offer. I will quietly, without naming names of any kind, confer with my compatriots and we will give you a yes or no, without naming names of any kind.
Matt: "Very well."
Taliesin: Before we leave, and just as a personal favor. I've been touched by a demon before, by a creature. Does it show here? Can you see?
Matt: He gives you a strong look.
Taliesin: I'm going to pull Hex up on myself.
Matt: At which point, you see his expression change, and he rears back and goes, "It doesn't show, but the blood ward leaves its scar on many who exist here. Your essence is not of the Abyss, I would not worry. But do be careful in flashing such power."
Taliesin: I'm thankful. My last question  this taskmaster of yours, the name you gave me, is it his true name?
Matt: "No. True names, now that is an expensive trade."
Taliesin: One would hope. Would have made our job much easier.
Matt: "And mine long ago."
Taliesin: Fair. We will meditate upon it.
Matt: "I will say  beware the Whisperers, the golden-armored fliers, the watchers of the archdevil himself. His paranoia seeks to know everything that goes on, and should such treachery that we talk of be revealed, well, that would a very unfitting end to me, my compatriots, and every one of your friends."
Taliesin: I will not speak your name in public. I will not speak your name in private, to be honest. You'll just be Our Friend Downstairs for now.
Matt: "Avoid the Whisperers." He snaps again and the sphere of darkness fades, and you're back in the tavern, unmoved.
Travis: Anybody looking at us strange?
Matt: No. The one person in the room there, the rather bulky fellow in the corner seems to be half-asleep, almost like (sleepy lip smacking).
Taliesin: We finish our drinks. Keep an eye on the door, see if that strange dwarf-like creature shows up.
Matt: You finish your drinks over the next couple of minutes or so-- it wasn't a heavy pour. Ipkesh just intensely, with a slight smile, looks you both over as you all quietly assess your positions in the discussion. No sign of that individual you saw earlier.
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: I've made up my mind.
Taliesin: Well, the rest have to do the--
Travis: No, no, it's you and me down here.
Taliesin: No, we're going up.
Travis: If you want your glasses back, we decide here and now.
Taliesin: That's fair. Let's head upstairs. (laughter)
Travis: Damn it!
Taliesin: We head up.
Laura: How'd it go?
Taliesin: Well, our friend downstairs says be careful of what you talk about out loud. It's pretty standard.
Travis: Apparently people are listening to everything.
Laura: Like in here?
Taliesin: Probably in here.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: So no names. No specifics.
Laura: God, it's good to be so cool.
Taliesin: Well. It's pretty typical.
Matt: Doty is writing that. Tary goes, "Don't-- don't write that down."
Travis: How many empty soul stones did she have while we were gone?
Laura: I've had none! This place is just so hot.
Liam: So, we switch back to Little Elf Boy, Little Elf Girl, Antlers, Greg.
Taliesin: I definitely would recommend everybody not use their real names. That's something I should've pointed out earlier. Nothing here is using its real name.
Laura: Did you ask him if you don't look like a tiefling if people are going to notice?
Taliesin: I didn't. But I asked him some other things.
Travis: I don't think it matters, though.
Taliesin: I don't think it matters, either.
Liam: What did you find out?
Taliesin: Well, there's a prison underneath the city.
Marisha: Yes. Knew that.
Taliesin: Our friend says he can probably, very likely get us in there and get us close enough to deal with our problem.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I believe him.
Marisha: What's the catch?
Travis: We gotta kill someone.
Taliesin: It's the typical catch. We have to do him a favor.
Travis: And then get arrested for it.
Taliesin: Or he'll arrange for us to be arrested.
Travis: I understood that we kill him, then when we go to the prison, he knows people in the prison who would make sure that we find our way to the right places. But that's the shady part.
Liam: Who do we kill? The person you just spoke to?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: Someone else?
Taliesin: Someone else whose name I will not say out loud for now.
Liam: Okay. But you know it?
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: All right.
Laura: All right. How would we do that?
Taliesin: Well-- How do we ever do anything? (laughs)
Marisha: And why does he want this certain someone killed? I'm sure it's out of politics?
Taliesin: Sure.
Marisha: All right.
Travis: Business.
Marisha: Business.
Liam: It's just evil versus evil here.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's really actually quite convenient that there's no such thing as the right thing to do. It just sort of takes so many things off the table here.
Liam: Mm. You're not going to throw a rock and hit an innocent person in this city.
Taliesin: No, the rock is probably the most innocent person that you're going to throw.
Laura: What if somebody threw a rock and hit us? We're quite innocent.
Liam: Right-- Right.
Taliesin: It would be a contract, we would be--
Laura: Well, Tary is.
Marisha: A contract?
Taliesin: Everything here is a contract.
Marisha: But Tary's exclusive, he can't sign any more contracts!
Matt: "That's true! You told me that."
Taliesin: He would not be signing the contract.
Laura: (whispers) Don't say his name!
Marisha: I mean, Barry! Barry's exclusive.
Taliesin: Barry Barrington.
Marisha: (laughs) Barry Barrington!
Matt: "I don't like this at all."
Taliesin: Chin up, Barry. (laughs)
Marisha: Barry Barrington-- (laughs)
Taliesin: (chuckles) It's better than--
Matt: "Don't write that either!"
Taliesin: -- Perry Paddington.
Liam: Berenstain Bear.
Taliesin: Barry Paddington is actually-- has got a nice ring to it.
Travis: Well, if we've got your code name, what'll we call you?
Taliesin: Freddie.
Laura: Freddie.
Travis: Freddie. Right.
Laura: I wouldn't know that--
Taliesin: And Greg.
Liam: Is that, I mean, that kind of is your name, is that all right?
Taliesin: It's not really, it's a bit of it. It's off.
Travis: I still like D-Roll, but whatever.
Liam: D-Roll's good.
Taliesin: D-Roll's fine, just don't use any real first or last names, nothing you would sign to a piece of parchment.
Travis: Freddie, how do you feel about this plan?
Taliesin: I feel good about it. I feel like it's a terrible idea.
Travis: Right. But do you have any amendments to it? Would you change it somehow?
Taliesin: I would just confirm with someone of reason that we're to do this and get arrested for it, or we're to do this and otherwise--
Laura: Oh my god, how wonderful would it be if Scanlan could just Dimension Door-- Oh, I shouldn't have said his name. Could just Dimension Door down to that thing, to the room, and just slice up the little egg, and then--
Travis: Who's to say where he's going?
Laura: -- bamf out?
Taliesin: Well, we can't, can we?
Laura: Probably not.
Liam: Also, I'm not trying to prevent us from following this plan, but we were warned not to make any deals with any creature--
Marisha: We definitely made a deal between ourselves before we came down here: no contracts, no deals.
Travis: Right.
Taliesin: I didn't agree to that.
Liam: So the first thing we do, is--
Marisha: Make a contract.
Taliesin: Well, look at where we are, to be fair. I sort of knew we would have to.
Marisha: But do we need help getting arrested? I'm kind of with Grog! All I have to do is walk out into the square and open my mouth, and then I'll get arrested.
Taliesin: Do we just want to get arrested? Or do we want to actually end up where we need to be?
Travis: So my thought, right? Is that I think we have to be arrested. Breaking into a prison seems real tough. At least with this guy's plan, if he's lying, the worst we get is just straight-up arrested, which I would assume means all our toys get confiscated, right?
Laura: Probably.
Travis: So, not all of us go on the killing.
Marisha: A couple of us go and get arrested--
Travis: Yeah. And if he's a man of his word, then those people that are in get led along to this magic place where you can go and smash Chicken Little.
Marisha: And the rest of us can follow along?
Travis: But if he's a lying piece of shit, like I'm sure everyone else is, we're going to need someone on the outside--
Taliesin: I get the distinct impression that most people here are painstakingly honest, which is the horrifying thing about a place like this.
Travis: Really?
Taliesin: I think that they-- that there's a lot of lying by omission.
Liam: I have a thing. Might be helpful while we're here.
Laura: What is it?
Liam: It's a little vial of oil of etherealness. The oil can cover someone of my size, maybe Scanlan's size, and it lets you--
Laura: No Scanlan! (laughs) Well, he's not here--
Liam: Lets you walk through the Ethereal Plane for an hour, so you can sort of bypass where you are.
Marisha: (whispers) It's like wearing the Ring, the One Ring.
Liam: Little bit, yeah.
Laura: Like, you walk through walls?
Liam: Yeah, I mean, you're walking on a whole parallel--
Marisha: Dimension?
Liam: The way it was explained to me, on this piece of paper, is that you are parallel to where you are.
Marisha: I will say, having--
Liam: Can't pick anything up, I don't think, can't--
Marisha: -- having Truesight, if anything has Truesight, like the archdevils--
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: I'm pretty sure they can see into the Ethereal Plane, with Truesight. But that's only the archdevils who might have it, but it is illusory magic, I'm pretty sure.
Matt: How does it say it on the item?
Liam: Well, it's the effect of the Etherealness spell, for one hour.
Matt: Oh right and so, for that-- the specifics on that.
Liam: I was trying to sprinkle fairy dust on it, but let's just go to the rules, shall we?
Matt: Let's see here, 4th-- 8th-level.
Marisha: 'Cause I think anything with Truesight can see into the Ethereal Plane, I think.
Liam: This is like Nazgűl KY.
Matt: Kind of. It says  You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration, or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. You can see and hear the Plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, so yeah, it's like The One Ring, but you can shift in any direction. You can only--
Marisha: Is it considered illusory magic?
Matt: No, Transmutation.
Marisha: It is Transmutation.
Matt: While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures in that Plane. Creatures that aren't in the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you, can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so. You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the Plane you originated from.
Laura: God, I really wish we had the stones with us now.
Liam: Yeah, but it's a-- this is a slow-moving one-way ticket.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: It's an hour.
Laura: Yeah, but--
Liam: So I could use it--
Laura: I mean, you could find your way down there.
Liam: Right, or if we get trapped, one of us could lather up and get out. I mean, I don't know what-- we don't really know what we're dealing with yet, but it's just good to know that we have it in our back pocket.
Taliesin: Well.
Marisha: I mean, with Shapechange, I can change down to one of these little weird, eight-winged insects we've seen flying around.
Taliesin: Imps, imps.
Travis: And do what?
Marisha: Get in.
Liam: Then change into something bigger and squish the egg.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: You can't think they won't notice that you're an imp that doesn't belong to anybody?
Laura: No, not an imp. It's an insect.
Marisha: The little insects that have we've been seeing flying around that might be little, tiny, very tiny imps, I don't know.
Liam: I mean, it's not a bad idea. Lot of variables, but it's a pretty good idea.
Matt: Do keep in mind, when you Shapechange, you maintain the hit points of whatever--
Marisha: Of whatever I change into. So if I get down there and I get caught--
Laura: You'll bamf into yourself.
Marisha: I'll bamf into myself. So, the way Shapechange works, is whatever I assume first-- we need to clarify this later, not now, 'cause it's like whatever you had before, is what you have. So do you just have 1 HP the whole time, based on whatever you changed into first?
Matt: Yes. So, if you turn into a dragon with 300 hit points, that's great. The next thing you turn into cannot have more than 300 hit points.
Marisha: Right, but if it goes down--
Matt: If it gets damaged down to, say, ten hit points, and then you turn into a different kind of dragon, that dragon will still have ten hit points.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: Or if you turn into a fly that has one hit point max, and then back into a dragon, it'll be a dragon with--
Marisha: -- one hit point.
Matt: -- one hit point.
Matt: You cannot regain hit points by changing forms with the spell.
Laura: Oh, wow.
Marisha: But it's whatever I had before. So I can't change into something awesome, then change into something less awesome--
Taliesin: Crappy, and then back into something awesome.
Marisha: -- and still have its hit points?
Matt: You can do it, but you'll-- whenever you squeeze through to the tiny hit points, those carry over into the big creature.
Liam: So you're saying you don't bring your 300 dragon hit points down into the fly body, you switch to-- you switch to fly hit points.
Matt: Unless it's the last resort, or you have a way out, yeah.
Travis: I think we go perform the hit, and then we leave Tary, I mean Barry, to get arrested. Right?
Matt: "Just-- well, no, we're going to do that, all of us, right?"
Travis: Like super-secret spy. No, this is a very privileged role.
Matt: "Really?"
Travis: Yep, big-time macho-man stuff.
Matt: "Are you going to get me out of the prison?"
Travis: Yeah!
Marisha: Prison Break-style. It'd be so dramatic.
Laura: I just don't think we should do that to Barry.
Travis: He's ready for more responsibility, right?
Laura: I really don't feel like he is.
Matt: "I think she might be right in this instance, but, if we're going together and you guys stay around me. We're a team, right? That's what teams do, we do things as a team! Vox Machina--"
Laura: Don't say our name. Don't whisper.
Matt: "Grox Dock-in-da-- Stop writing it down, Doty!"
Marisha: Box Cockina.
Travis: Really?
Liam: Whomp-whomp.
Taliesin: So, do we say yes to this?
Laura: Oh, dear lord.
Liam: To doing the hit and then going to prison?
Taliesin: Well, what else are we going to do?
Liam: Right, no, I'm not arguing.
Travis: (sings) Don't say no to this.
Taliesin: I say yes.
Travis: Yeah, me too!
Marisha: We can also always-- yeah, all right. Wait, what did we just agree to?
Laura: To killing an archdevil.
Travis: No.
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: We're taking this contract?
Matt: Not an archdevil.
Liam: Wait a second, wait a second. When you peeked into Hotis--
Matt: Killing a greater devil. There's a big difference.
Travis: Archdevil is the Pope of this area.
Liam: When she peeked-- I'm asking Keyleth, but you might need to come in here with detail. When you peeked in at Hotis, what-- Like, how much security was around him. What was around him?
Matt: Didn't really see.
Liam: Didn't see. Just saw a Cadbury egg.
Matt: Flashes of interior--
Marisha: It comes in pulses.
Matt: -- and like (bff) and then all of a sudden--
Travis: Definitely something big with big, red, flashing wings, though.
Marisha: Yeah. Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah. Archdevil or no. Hard to say.
Laura: Could be, like, a pit fiend or something.
Marisha: I'm getting the idea that maybe Hotis serves Dispater? Dis--?
Liam: Dispater, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah. Dispater. Yeah, kind of think he serves him, so we're kind of maybe going in to kill one of his literal secret spies. Think it's kind of what's going on.
Liam: Yeah, that's what we're doing. So, kill the thing, get arrested, possible bug Keyleth, possible ethereal Keyleth as ways to get in and out. Possibly.
Marisha: I mean, I can always Beast Shape there, then have Shapechange later. You know, I can do the whole be a flying squirrel in someone's pocket, like we've done before, type of thing.
Liam: Yeah. I mean, once we kill this thing, which we will, we're diving into the unknown.
Travis: Do we all want to kill the thing?
Taliesin: Once we kill this thing, we Plane Shift out of here faster than you can say-- Oh, oh, we're--
Liam: Not Hotis. The contract. To get to Hotis. That's the owner's--
Taliesin: That, we'll confirm with our friend. That, we'll confirm with our person. And, seem like I don't want to use that term too loosely. We'll see what would be most advantageous for getting what we want out of this situation.
Liam: All right, so he gets what he wants and then we see if we get what we want.
Marisha: How easy is it going to be to kill this--
Laura: It won't be easy! Let's be honest.
Marisha: -- mysterious person?
Laura: This is going to suck!
Liam: Yeah, I mean, we had a fucking nanny who used to tell us nightmare stories about this. It's way worse than she described it.
Taliesin: Pit fiend-ish.
Marisha: So, wait, we're expecting two of you to kill something pit fiend-ish level--
Taliesin: No, all of us.
Marisha: I-- what? What is happening?
Taliesin: All of us. We're going to kill this thing--
Marisha: So we all kill the thing and then two of you get arrested and then the rest of us follow you?
Taliesin: All of us get arrested.
Liam: All of us get arrested.
Marisha: We're all getting arrested now!
Liam: Yeah, mm-hm.
Matt: "That's much better!"
Marisha: What happened to like two of us getting arrested?
Matt: "That's much better, I like that plan."
Travis: Explain to me about the contract. So, in the contract, if he doesn't hold up his end of the bargain, like, he explodes or something, right? It's a magic contract?
Taliesin: It will quite possibly be a magic contract.
Laura: You're not going to have to sign anything, yeah?
Travis: Because if we get arrested, and they take all our goodies, and we're in a cell, I'm going to kill all of you with my bare hands.
Taliesin: We're going to ask him this downstairs. I just want to take it to you and see if everyone thinks that we're going this direction. We'll make the most comfortable deal we can, but honestly, I'm very curious if anybody has any better ideas.
Matt: "We've already gone to hell. Let's also go to prison!"
Marisha: We could try and just straight-up espionage--
Travis: Prison assault.
Marisha: -- stealth this. Prison assault, and I could do a Locate Creature, and we could just figure out where Hotis is and try and completely, yeah, prison break this. Without signing any contracts.
Taliesin: Full-frontal assault on a demon prison in the basement of--
Marisha: I'm not saying full-frontal, I'm saying--
Liam: Well, walk us through it again. Walk me through it again, one more time.
Marisha: We're stealthy motherfuckers, right?
Travis: We don't know where the prison is.
Matt: Tary raises his hand slowly, "Doty, put your hand up."
Laura: These are the least stealthy people I think I've ever seen, and we know Pike.
Matt: "I mean no offense, big guy, but--"
Travis: What?
Matt: "Nothing."
Laura: He's quiet.
Matt: "Nothing."
Laura: He's really quiet.
Matt: "Su-- Nothing at all."
Laura: His boots are made of fur.
Matt: "I know, they're beautiful. Did you make those?"
Laura: They're very quiet.
Travis: No.
Liam: But you two, Kerry, are very loud. Is what you're saying.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "(squeaky voice) I get nervous."
Marisha: Barry, is there any way that you can, like, (sighs) condense Doty? Put him in your po-- No?
Liam: I mean, reality is, two of us are stealthy. Everybody else is mediocre or worse.
Marisha: I'm really good. Okay? Really good. I know you're talking about you and your sister, but I'm really good, too. Just want to point that out.
Liam: Okay.
Taliesin: Lava.
Marisha: Fuck. Off. Percy. Fuck off.
Liam: Wow.
Marisha: That had nothing to do with stealth. That had straight only to do with dexterity, which is not my strong suit.
Travis: Hey, Beekus, you just said his real name.
Marisha: (sighs) Freddie. Fuck.
Travis: So, hey, Freddie, like, how long do you think guy downstairs will give us to decide?
Taliesin: I figure-- Well, if we're going to do this, I think we should do it quickly.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: Probably listening to us.
Marisha: No, they're not. I'm getting--
Travis: Not supposed to make any deals. We could just try and do it on our own. The deal might put us in a position where we're totally fucked.
Taliesin: It might.
Travis: We don't even know where the prison is.
Marisha: (whispers) But we could find out.
Travis: You think.
Laura: Can you cast Locate Creature right now?
Marisha: Yes! Yes, I can!
Laura: Just cast it and see.
Marisha: I 100% can!
Liam: Let's do it.
Laura: Let's do it.
Marisha: I fucking cast Locate Creature!
Matt: Okay.
Liam: See, part of our problem is sometimes-- always, we grab the first opportunity in front of our fucking faces, so--
Travis: Isn't that the way life is?
Liam: Let's explore this opportunity.
Taliesin: What level are you casting Locate Creature at?
Liam: 27.
Marisha: Level? It's a level two-- a level four spell.
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: Will that work on him?
Matt: You cannot cast it at a higher level. Well, you can cast it at a higher level, but there's no effect.
Marisha: It doesn't do anything.
Taliesin: Okay. I was curious if he has a blind spot or not.
Matt: All right, so, you take a moment, you finish casting Locate Creature. You concentrate once again on Hotis, keeping a very clear image of what you saw in the Scry spell. As you complete the spell--
Liam: Ho-Dis.
Matt: -- nothing.
Marisha: What?
Laura: Because it's a level fucking four.
Taliesin: It's all right.
Matt: Well, the creature has to be within 1000 feet.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: And it has to be within-- But it lasts for an hour. It's a concentration spell.
Matt: It is.
Travis: Just take off running around the city, man. Boom! Marathon Woman. Go get it.
Marisha: I can fly. I can look and fly.
Taliesin: Turn into an imp.
Travis: (sings) She's a maniac, man-- oh, he's down there!
Marisha: I could go right now and fly around while it lasts for an hour. Do a quick scout.
Travis: How do you fly?
Marisha: With fucking Beast Shape by being like a beasty thing.
Travis: Can you do that and concentrate at the same time?
Marisha: Yeah. That's at-will.
Travis: Yeah, sure off, go on. Fly off by yourself, nobody cares.
Liam: I'll go with her.
Travis: How do you go?
Laura: You're not a-- well, it doesn't matter.
Liam: I'm not what? What am I not?
Laura: A tiefling anymore.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: I know. But she's a big fucking bird, I mean--
Marisha: I don't have to be a big fucking bird--
Laura: She could be a succubus.
Marisha: -- I could be literally a tiny fucking bird, or a succubus.
Liam: All right, do your thing.
Marisha: If I am a succubus, though, it's burning my 9th-level spell and we're done for the night.
Travis: You get captured or eaten out there, we're done for the night anyway. (laughs)
Taliesin: Fair.
Liam: Hell is tearing this team apart.
Marisha: What were the weird imp things that I saw flying around?
Travis: Imps.
Laura: Those are the golden armored things
Marisha: The gold armor imps.
Matt: There are impish creatures with golden armor that you saw at a distance in the sky above.
Laura: Was there anything else flying other than them?
Matt: There were other creatures flying, but they were too far away to really make up any decent-- and some of them of them were just imps, just the tiny little devils that fly around, and there were some that seemed a little larger with humanoid bodies and giant, leathery wings that were just coasting through.
Liam: And you said this is like the biggest city we've ever seen?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: There are things that fly here?
Matt: There are many things that fly. The first thing you saw when you looked up in the sky was at least a dozen or so winged creatures all up in the clouds.
Laura: Oh, god.
Marisha: I can go. Going to the window. Anyone stopping me?
Laura: There's no window, it's just wall.
Marisha: There's no windows. Anyone stopping me as I Alter Self and--
Travis: This is your game, go for it.
Marisha: -- head towards the door? No?
Travis: Do it.
Marisha: No one? All right, I'm going to go do a quick pass. (laughs)
Liam: Oh, gosh. Be careful.
Travis: Have that backup character ready. (laughter)
Laura: She becomes leader of the Ashari and dies as soon as she gets to hell.
Taliesin: One day.
Travis: Go get it, keep going. Momentum!
Marisha: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. I'm going to Shapechange.
Matt: You're casting Shapechange, okay.
Marisha: Level nine.
Matt: All right, what are you turning into?
Marisha: I'm going to do a succubus. I know I've got a good look at them and they can fly.
Laura: Wait, are succubuses devils down here or are they demons?
Marisha: They're devils.
Liam: Those are devils, and we saw one under Krieg's house.
Matt: They're fiends.
Laura: Okay. They're fiends.
Marisha: And they're kind of rogue agents. I'm hoping no one questions this.
Matt: Okay. So you have succubus.
Marisha: Shit. Okay. Mm. Just-- quick loop.
Liam: Ermahgerd.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Yeah, ermahgerd--
Laura: Ermahgerd.
Marisha: I, as the tiefling, walk out of the tavern, just very intent on my direction. As I walk out of the building, I take a left, hang down an alleyway, check over my shoulder, make sure no one's watching and then (fwoof) into a succubus and take off.
Matt: Okay, make a stealth check real fast.
Travis: Oh god.
Laura: Oh god.
Marisha: Fucking hell.
Taliesin: Fucking hell is right.
Travis: (sings) Highway to the danger zone.
Marisha: Just a straight-- oh, that's good, that's good. 20 total. No, no, 21 total.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I forgot my proficiency bonus went up.
Matt: As you exit the building and turn right and into the alleyway, being careful not to be seen in your tiefling form, begin to cast the spell as you see two shadows step into the entranceway of the alleyway.
Marisha: Nope. I stop it.
Matt: Okay. So you stop it?
Marisha: Yep, and I just kind of keep walking.
Matt: You just keep walking? Okay. You don't even look back, you just keep walking?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay. Keep walking, and you hear footsteps behind you.
Marisha: I start blocking around.
Matt: Okay. As you go blocking around, the footsteps seem to be keeping pace with you. There's two sets of them.
Marisha: Peek over my shoulder. Do I get a glimpse on who they are?
Matt: You see what appears to be a squat, kind of tan-skinned dwarf-like figure.
Marisha: It's the dwarf again.
Matt: The features, like you expect to see a dwarf, appears to be a female dwarf of some kind, but there's some sort of physical alteration's taken place. They look like they've been either very injured and healed wrong, or some sort of corruption has taken place. But it's walking forward with this hobbling gait, and to the left you see the other entity that is just wrapped in chains, and they're about 30 feet behind you.
Marisha: 30 feet behind me?
Matt: About 30 feet behind you, yeah.
Marisha: Are we alone?
Matt: It's just you and the two of them right now. Just in this small alleyway off in the building that's immediately adjacent to the structure where you're staying.
Marisha: I'm still, I imagine, within range of the tavern?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Just gonna say, I'm being followed so be on alert. Same dwarven chainy figure.
Laura: Should we come out?
Liam: Do you need us out there?
Marisha: No, just wait a second, I'll say Jenga if need be.
Taliesin: Stretching.
Marisha: I stop, about-face, and light up my hands and keep the hood up. And just say, I know you're there. What do you want, and who are you? Keep the hood up.
Matt: Head's down. The footsteps slow when they get about 20 feet from you. And they stop. You keep your head down. The dwarf figure brings one weird, swollen, twisted arm in front of the other, crosses it. The chained figure, you hear all the jangling, shifting, and as you get a better glance over your shoulder towards it, you can see the chains that dangle don't just dangle, they're all kind of slowly shifting and spinning around, like hundreds of small snakes that are just readjusting and moving across the body. You can see its eyes, part of its nose through as the chains pull across and hide most of its features. The skin itself a deep, deep pinkish-red, like a normal body that's been constricted so much that all the blood has rushed to the surface.
Marisha: Off-the-cuff, do they seem familiar? Any idea on who they might be?
Matt: No. But there is a heavy breathing from the female dwarf figure that just-- they glance at each other.
Marisha: I say, do you want to tell me? You want to tell me who you are? 'Cause I don't have a lot of time to deal with this.
Matt: The chained one says, "You seem to walk with a white one."
Marisha: Who's asking?
Matt: "I am asking."
Marisha: 'I' could be referred to many people, including myself. So I am asking--
Matt: "Silence. You will bring us the white one, or you will be tribute yourself."
Marisha: What do you want with him?
Matt: There's no response.
Marisha: I don't think you'd want me as tribute, so you'd best bet tell me what you want with him, because maybe we could strike a deal.
Matt: "The white one caught the attention of a creature that I wish to see pleased."
Marisha: Well, is this creature willing to make a deal? Because the white one belongs to me.
Matt: "You have ownership of the white one?"
Marisha: Of course.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: It's not really lying.
Marisha: (laughs) It's not really a-- Not great. Six total. (laughter)
Marisha: It's not entirely wrong, though.
Matt: "Hm." You hear the chains intensify with the rattling and clanking. "Perhaps you should walk with us."
Marisha: Where are we going?
Matt: "To the one who wishes to now know of your ownership."
Marisha: And if I decline?
Matt: "Then you will no longer be able to stop us."
Marisha: I'm sorry, I still didn't catch your name.
Matt: "You do not need our name." And that's where we're going to leave tonight's episode. (all groan)
Marisha: Oh, what?!
Taliesin: Yeah! I love Hells, man.
Matt: It's 11AM, or 11PM, and that's a fun place to pick up next week.
Laura: Oh my gosh. Oh no!
Taliesin: Oh no.
Travis: I could be many people, it could all f-- Silence! (laughter)
Taliesin: Or that, okay.
Marisha: It's kind of a pejorative, you know. Do we need to know like-- what kind of "I"? Is this this royal "I"?
Travis: It's royal "we".
Marisha: The royal "we"?
Matt: Shapechange, how you force me into bringing even more minis to the game every week. (laughter)
Matt: Just in case.
Travis: Multiple bags.
Taliesin: We can leave them here now.
Matt: I'm doing that.
Marisha: I didn't burn the spell, right? I stopped it, I didn't burn the spell, I stopped it. Right? Because I was like "Cancel cancel cancel", come on, man.
Taliesin: My vibe is it didn't burn.
Marisha: I thought it didn't burn either.
Matt: I will say, just for the sake of this, for the sake of-- this roll will determine this. Roll-- what's your passive perception actually?
Marisha: My passive perception?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Pretty good.
Taliesin: You've got to do something about that. That's becoming a problem.
Marisha: Shut up.
Laura: Shut up. (laughs)
Marisha: 21.
Matt: 21? I'll say you cancelled it, you did manage to just catch their movement out of the corner of your eye, just as you entered the alleyway, and you-- just as you were about to begin the spell, they arrived.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: That's only because they didn't roll very high stealth themselves. Well, cool!
Marisha: Fucking hell.
Matt: Thank you guys so much. Literally. Fucking Hells. Plural, guys.
Laura: Things aren't going very well here.
Taliesin: I think they're going great.
Matt: This is fun. I love--
Marisha: We're not slaves yet.
Laura: Hey, bonus!
Matt: I love the City of Dis. You guys just scraped the surface. All right, so we'll be back here next week on Thursday. We'll also be-- some of us will be here on Tuesday, for Talks Machina at seven. We'll talk about this chaos. We'll be at Wondercon, April 1st, 2-3PM for our Critical Role panel, please come and see us. Thank you again for Puzzle Quest for being our awesome sponsor today.
