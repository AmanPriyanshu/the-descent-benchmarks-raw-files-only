[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome, everybody, to Critical Role! Our Thursday night show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons and roll dice and all that fun stuff in between! So for all you new folks, welcome to our chaos. For all you old folks, thanks and welcome back. We have a number of announcements to get through. I'll try and cruise through them as fast as humanly possible. Pardon my phone as a reminder. Google docs are a delightful thing. Starting off, I wanted to direct all you Critters to our official Twitter, @CriticalRole, for official news and announcements. You're welcome to still tweet at us for individual cast fun but we do have our official source for all official announcements, times, and our appearances. That would be the one to pay attention to. Go to @CriticalRole, follow it and any important stuff that comes in the future will be available via that Twitter. Awesome. Next up this weekend we're all going to be at New York Comic Con, which is going to be awesome. We have a two hour block from noon to 2:00 PM Saturday, October 12th. Where is it at? What's the room?
Liam: It's a weird word, the Winga Stage?
Matt: It's not on the Google Doc. Curse you, Google doc! But Saturday from noon to 2:00 PM, and then on Sunday, for those who can't make the actual convention, we're having an off-site gathering of Critters at the wonderful and illustrious comic book store Forbidden Planet. That will be from 2:30 to 4:30. Our time block shifted a little later in the day. 2:30 to 4:30, Forbidden Planet, we'll be there. We'll be signing autographs, meeting you guys, chatting it up, and we'll be debuting our brand new awesome poster here, exclusively for the New York Comic Con. Our Critical Role poster! We're super excited about it. This was wonderfully designed by one of our fellow Critters Joma Cueto. Joma did the art and Kim Davis did the actual layout and design. Both did an amazing job. We're going to have a bunch of these available. We'll be signing them for you guys, and we'll hope to see you there.
Liam: I love it.
Travis: They are pretty sexy.
Liam: We're going to be on the Wikia stage.
Matt: The Wikia stage on Saturday, near hall 1A, the Wikia stage at noon to 2:00 PM. Come find us on Saturday, we're going to be there. Also, a ton of mail was recently received just after Critmas. If your gifts weren't seen this last Critmas, they're probably in this batch. So next Critmas is probably going to be a long haul. It's going to be a doozy! But we're excited about that. That'll be the first Thursday of November, so look forward to that happening then. Next update. If you haven't been paying attention, we've been having occasional interviews once a week of our cast going up on Geek and Sundry's website. Today we had Travis's go up and if you haven't checked them out you should. It's a little step into our mindset, our crazy history and background of how this whole thing got started. Silly things ensue. So go read them if you have the chance, if you haven't yet. Or wait until after the show. Also, as of today we now have in the Geek and Sundry store Critical Role key chains and necklaces.
Laura: They look so cool.
Matt: Pretty rad. I'm really excited. They're metal and awesome. They're of our logo and if you feel like being as nerdy as we are and want to adorn your key chains with them, they are there available for your purchase.
Laura: They're custom order, so they make them when you order them. It takes a few weeks to get them once you order them, but it's worth it.
Liam: They have to come all the way from Kraghammer.
Matt: Mithril's hard to sculpt properly. Takes a while. Couple of other things, LARP: the Series, one of the live action series here in Geek and Sundry. Season two just premiered today. It's a really cool series that both has moments of drama and comedy that plays into the whole world and lifestyle of the LARPing game systems and the people. It's a really cool series. Check it out if that's your kind of bag. It's good stuff, really funny. Next Monday starts a new show called TPK Monday Nights, where our illustrious Ivan, who hosts many wonderful things here, will be running for the rest of October a group of other individuals through the RPG Outbreak Undead, which is actually a really cool RPG that Ivan actually designed and was in the whole process for, so it's Monday nights, check that out the rest of October! To keep the Halloween theme, we will probably be getting dead repeatedly at the hands of Ivan, so look forward to that. This is the last week you can buy the #NoShaveTil10k shirts. We have people who are keeping it up. I had to shave for Vin Diesel, but the rest of the month is straight on this now, largely for my Halloween costume and for this wonderful event. 20% of all proceeds from those shirts goes to the Extra Life charity we've been supporting, it helps out good people.
Zac: I drew that shirt, by the way. I had to look at his face for 12 hours.
Travis: You're welcome.
Zac: We've already hit 9,100. Protocol95, you are the first winner of the night!
Matt: Protocol95, congratulations. You will be winning the first bundle. Every 100 subscribers there will be another giveaway within the chat room. You have to be active in the chat to be up for it. It includes a cast photo signed by the cast of Critical Role, possibly signed while he's wearing that awesome beard. And a wonderful piece of art from our main artist Kit Buss, also signed by the cast of Critical Role. So every 100 subscribers, that giveaway goes out in the chatroom. Be active and bring your friends on to subscribe so you can win one. Last thing I want to mention, this has been a question that's come up quite a bit, some people are definitely eager to hear the information, so I had the pleasure on Monday this week of designing and running a very quick game of Dungeons and Dragons for Vin Diesel.
Liam: What? (laughs)
Matt: Let's just cross that bucket list item off immediately. That was ridiculous. So it was a lot of fun. He was fantastic, super awesome, genuine, and was really excited--
Laura: He rolled this die. It's sacred.
Taliesin: It was literally bucket list! That was one of the things we discussed when this game started; it could lead to a game with Vin Diesel.
Marisha: I bet if you go back and look at the Q and A session we had, someone asked our dream game crew--
Matt: Vin Diesel was one of our bucket list players. So we've already knocked one off on the show.
Taliesin: It's like a group mass suicide at this point.
Matt: Get matching tennis shoes, and it'll be great.
Liam: You didn't seem that excited, though.
Zac: We can already announce that next Thursday at the midpoint--
Matt: Next Thursday at the midpoint of next week's Critical Role, we are going to show a mostly complete video of that game. The full one will be released shortly thereafter, but next week, on Critical Role during the midpoint, we're going to show you the majority of that game session with him. Don't miss that.
Orion: Can I get a teaser? What did he smell like?
Liam: Iron.
Travis: Quarry.
Laura: Muscle.
Taliesin: Antifreeze and lilac.
Matt: All of those answers at once. A majestic scent. It was delightful. We'll have interviews going up throughout the week, exclusively next week here on Thursday you'll be seeing most of that game here and then more stuff's coming out for the week thereafter. Really excited about that, and I custom-made a witchhunter class for him that I tailored for that level, and there's been such a wide response for everyone asking about the class that I've now spent a lot of my free time that I'm not preparing for this game now customizing a homebrew witchhunter class for all of you to partake in. So that'll be fun and probably coming out sometime next week. It'll probably be broken. You're welcome to homebrew my homebrew, I'm not perfect, but it should be fun and a cool guide for some people to give it a shot as a player class, so look forward to that. Liam, you got a couple things to announce?
Liam: Yeah, just two things. I wanted to thank every Critter who helped out with Joe Madureira's Kickstarter with Airship Syndicate's Kickstarter for Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They crushed it. They got to almost every rung of their ladder. Maybe you guys could help them raise 100k tonight. But Joe told me that they saw a little bit of a bump every Thursday, and that our roleplaying power had some effect, so thank you guys, thank you very much.
Travis: Because we are many.
Matt: We are legion.
Liam: The other thing is tomorrow is Sam Riegel's birthday.
Travis: Nipples, is it really?
Liam: I have a birthday present for him tonight. Something I commissioned the lovely Kit Buss to make for you.
Sam: What? It's Vaxmas?
Liam: It's Vaxmas. Here it is. I'm going to send it across and then I'll tweet it out. You guys can look, but I made this just for you.
Sam: I'm not looking.
Marisha: I made this just for you.
Sam: Oh wow, that's really nice! I thought it was going to be vulgar. Wow. That's so sweet.
Travis: Kit Buss, why are you the best?
Sam: Thank you, Kit Buss. Me and two ladies, what could be better? Right?
Travis: I guess three ladies.
Sam: I don't know how to put this up, but thank you. That's so sweet. Aw. I won't kill you tonight.
Orion: Fun fact  Sam shares a birthday with my mom. That's why I'll never forget your birthday, ever.
Sam: And John Lennon.
Marisha: Happy birthday, Orion's mom.
Laura: Yeah. Happy birthday, Sam.
Matt: Happy unbirthday to Sam's mom, who is also a Critter. You should go follow her on Twitter.
Marisha: Momlan.
Liam: She's not effing around, either.
Matt: Any other announcements? Or shall we dive in?
Laura: I have one. I got nominated for a Golden Joystick award.
Matt: Really?
Laura: Yeah, for Fiona in Tales from the Borderlands.
Matt: That's awesome! (cheering)
Sam: Hey Travis, you didn't know this?
Laura: I didn't tell him. I think there's a week left of voting, so you can go and help out.
Orion: They can vote for you?
Laura: Yes, they can vote for me.
Sam: Can they vote many times?
Laura: I think you have to register your email address, so I don't know how many times you can vote, but you have to vote in all the categories in order to vote for the one category.
Travis: Congratulations, Laura.
Laura: Thanks, baby!
Marisha: As Orion says, release the Critters.
Matt: That's awesome. Go show your support for Fiona, and awesome! Let's go ahead and bring the mood back to our realm of imagination and fantasy and be back here in just a minute with the beginning of this night's Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: So to get you guys caught up on what happened recently, the group, having heard that the Briarwoods, a couple who had taken power in the town of Whitestone far to the northeast, apparently responsible for the destruction of Percy's entire family and his escape into the wilds of Tal'Dorei, were going to be coming to Emon to bridge a political handshake with Sovereign Uriel and all of Tal'Dorei proper to build a bridge across the channel that separates this continent from Wildemount across the sea. Upon hearing this, the party was planning to gather information, and in doing so Vax got himself caught by sneaking into their bedroom and was nearly killed in the process. The group managed to aid him, pull him out from the jaws of death, and the Briarwoods escaped through arcane means, leaving a shattered carriage, a mostly beaten driver of their carriage. Through the scuffle, a number of guards were hurt or killed, and the party, upon meeting an individual named Lilith, a tiefling, leading her back to the Keep, they were attacked, or seemingly attacked, by a series of bounty hunters that were after her. There was some intense violence displayed against a few of them, and this all got back to the Council. The Council called Vox Machina to the central palace and began a trial to see if they were responsible for attacking guests of the Council, ruining what could've been a very lucrative union between the two towns and possibly murdering an old woman. They had their membership revoked, and during this sequence, apparently the charmed Seeker Asum was restored, seemingly to little effect. The group then left, realizing that perhaps the moral ramifications of their actions are having a bigger impact due to their visibility and their heroic status in the kingdom at large. When they returned to the keep, they found two representatives of the northern farmers of Emon that required aid; their livestock had been stolen over the past few weeks and was putting them in dire straits when it came to the necessary amount of meat they had to raise. The group, trying to turn their morality on its head, decided to aid, waited out in the center of the cow pasture at night, masquerading, through illusionary magic, as cows themselves. The giant roc, a gargantuan bird, swooped down and grabbed Cow-leth, Keyleth, here. Swept her away. The rest of the party, Tiberius enabled to fly through arcane means, and thus we had a squadron of evening cows chasing after the roc, which then got turned into a cow, to crash into a mountain. They chased it back to its perch up in the Cliffside Mountains to the northwest of Emon.
Liam: Such an old trope in fantasy.
Matt: Isn't it, though? "Cow-mouflage." And engaged a guardian of this roc, a gnome druid who had been removed from society for quite some time. After some rather roundabout and at some points on-the-edge-of-conflict conversation, they managed to convince him to instead take the bird and flee across the Ozmit Sea, to the northwest, towards Vasselheim, where it would be a much better landscape for the creature to thrive and grow. After that, the party is making their way back. Right around the beginning of daybreak, towards the keep. So that is where we left off. Percy.
Taliesin: Yes? Hello.
Matt: Darkness. Cold, lonely darkness. A flicker of light. It swells, bright, white, blinding, then flashes of your family, screaming. Julius, silenced by a bolt to the throat. Vesper, thrown from a tower wall. Your younger brothers' lifeless bodies tossed in a pile. The smell of death filling your cell. Your father Frederick, a blade jutting from his chest, slick with crimson. Your mother, Johanna, burned with irons, screaming. Cassandra, running towards you, calling your name into the night, begging you to help. One, two, three arrows. She falls. Darkness once more. Darkness and red. Red of blood. Red of burning fire. The sky is fire. The world burns with flame and iron. The smoke rises from the cinders, coalescing into a face, black as soot with eyes as burning coals, and a wicked grin. It speaks with a raspy, rumbling bass, like a slow-moving landslide. "You hold your vengeance, Percival. You made it. You only need to take it for yourself. Make the world right. My gift is yours, and your gift shall bring justice. Our bargain stands eager to close." You suddenly come to consciousness, gasping loudly against the air. You feel the warmth of the forge across the side of the workshop crawling across your face. You are sitting at your workbench, having fallen asleep amidst a pile of contraptions in mid-construction. As you look around, you can see your leather gloves are still on, apron on, blackened soot spread across your face, and a series of things you were in mid-build on broken before you on your workshop table.
Taliesin: (sighs) How long have I been here?
Matt: There's nobody in the room, and you have no idea. You're underground in the workshop. You haven't seen the sun probably for a good day and a half.
Orion: It's a new day. I didn't waste it at all.
Matt: You have no idea quite how long you've been down here, and you've been left alone for quite some time.
Taliesin: I'm going to head upstairs.
Matt: You go and open the metallic door that leads into your workshop and come around the corner, and there's a chair set in the corner, where Jarett would be sitting, one of the head guards at your facility. Jarett, however, is standing, hands up to his throat, going (choking sounds) with no visible assailant.
Taliesin: (shouting) Help!
Sam: Are we there? No, we're not even there.
Matt: I want you to go ahead and roll initiative.
Sam: Oh shit, it's already started!
Laura: Trinket was down there.
Sam: Was?
Laura: Don't say that!
Sam: Just saying that Trinket died already.
Laura: Don't say it.
Taliesin: Natural 20. 28. (cheering)
Matt: And that's how Percy does it.
Travis: What is with that dice and you, man?
Liam: You are the yin to Wil Wheaton's yang.
Taliesin: He was sitting here 20 minutes ago. I rubbed him for luck when he was leaving the building.
Marisha: No, we have him. It's balance.
Matt: All right. So what's your total?
Taliesin: 28.
Matt: 28. (laughs) You are definitely-- Okay. You are up first. What do you want to do? As you come around the corner and you see this visual in front of you. If you want to go ahead and roll for Trinket, too.
Laura: (worried noises) Oh no!
Taliesin: So I just see him up like this?
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19? Nice.
Taliesin: Just for some reference, does it look like he's possessed, or does it look like he's trying to remove something?
Matt: It looks like he's trying to remove something from around his neck, and looking down, you can see his feet are actually off the ground, kicking. It looks like there's a little bit of air wisping around behind him.
Taliesin: How insane would it be to try and make a shot beneath his legs?
Matt: You can certainly go for it and try.
Taliesin: I'm going to drop down. Can I make an aimed shot against something I can't see?
Matt: You can try, it'll be with disadvantage, but you can definitely make it.
Orion: He's in the kitchen?
Laura: No, he's downstairs.
Sam: Can I request that the rest of us do the sounds of the ricocheting bullets in case he misses?
Taliesin: Okay, I want 5.1; start here and make it all the way down.
Laura: But you're not going to miss, so it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: I'm going to take an aimed shot for my first shot, and then start firing blindly.
Matt: This will be disadvantage against an invisible assailant.
Travis: It misses?
Taliesin: It missed. I'm just making sure I didn't misfire. No, I didn't! Thank god.
Matt: So what's the total?
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: Total of 15? Still hits.
Taliesin: Still hits? 15 hits? Oh, that's 16 points of damage, and he has to make a constitution saving throw to not be knocked prone.
Matt: Okay. What's the DC on that?
Taliesin: Where is my DC? DC of eight plus my proficiency mod, plus my dexterity mod, so 19.
Matt: Sure enough. You see all of a sudden the air go (gasp) and Jaret falls to his knees (coughs).
Taliesin: I'm going to take two more shots right above his head.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: Don't hit Jarett.
Matt: Jarett's on his knees, prone, essentially.
Sam: He could still hit Jarett! He's our best guy.
Matt: You still have disadvantage on these.
Taliesin: I don't?
Matt: No, you still have disadvantage on these. It is still an invisible creature.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Taliesin: That's 13.
Matt: 13 does not hit.
Taliesin: No, 13 points of damage.
Matt: Oh. Yes.
Taliesin: And then 20 again.
Matt: 20 hits.
Taliesin: Nine points of damage.
Matt: Nine points of damage. (gunshots) The gunshots are echoing through the hallway. Whatever this weird entity is, you can see some of the nearby cloth and dust swirl up from its movement, you hear this (gasping sound), this angry sucking sound in the air around you. Do you want to move, or are you staying where you are?
Taliesin: I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going to keep yelling. Help! I don't think I have an earring.
Matt: You see some sort of shimmer of wind come around the corner towards you. This one turns around and (whooshing sound) over to the bars, and you can see in the distance, it's moving over towards where your captive currently is.
Orion: How far away are we from the keep?
Matt: I'm getting to that. At the end of this combat round, all of you guys are right toward the outskirts of the keep, and you hear the muffled ringing of gunshots from the inside of the keep.
Orion: We do hear that.
Matt: You do hear this as you're just getting to the outer gates.
Orion: As soon as I hear that, I cast Fly on myself and (whoosh).
Laura: Are you wearing an earring, Percy?
Matt: No, he is not. The entity swooshes down the stairs and comes at you. That's going to be a 22.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: And a 12.
Taliesin: That does not.
Matt: It swings towards you, and a giant slam of extremely condensed air with a raking claw impact hits you in the torso, doing 15 points of bludgeoning damage. The other one swings out, same direction. This time you actually pull off to the side and knock it out of the way with your Pepperbox. The one back there is going to attempt to grapple. Succeeds. That's its action, and you can see the driver that you had put into prison is currently being (choking) making strangling sounds in the distance. That ends it. Trinket's up.
Laura: Trinket. He can see Percy getting attacked and instinct takes over, and he runs forward and he claws him.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Laura: That does not hit. That's a natural 20.
Matt: That will hit! (laughs) It begins.
Laura: Oh, that's the wrong thing. That's a 2d4.
Matt: So roll 2d4 and then multiply those by two.
Laura: 17 damage.
Matt: 17 damage, nice. Trinket runs up, coming out of his somewhat sleepy stupor, goes for a bite attack and grabs nothing with it, and turns around and rakes a claw backwards, manages to get the back of whatever this entity is, and you hear it scream (gasping scream). You do, at least.
Taliesin: I have a technical dispute, really quickly. Could the wraith have gotten that far, since I knocked him prone?
Matt: Yes, it could've, because it uses half its movement speed to get up.
Taliesin: Oh, thank you. Never mind.
Matt: Its movement is actually 50.
Taliesin: Ignore me! 50?!
Matt: Not that you know that. But it moved far for what you think it should've been able to.
Orion: By the way, for the record, Matthew, I have no idea what we're fighting.
Travis: Nobody does.
Orion: I'm just saying, I haven't meta-gamed here.
Matt: Congrats. (laughs) I'm proud of you.
Liam: Fresh start.
Matt: Jarett then gets up, sees this happening, moves over, and pulls out the key to try and open the prison door. Spends the turn doing so. Manages to get the door open. That's the end of Jarett's turn. Okay, now, the rest of you guys roll initiative.
Travis: Okay. Come on, you giant ball-bearing. Damn.
Laura: Does that count, if I hit it into my box and it slammed into the side? Does that count, or should I let it roll naturally?
Matt: Let it roll naturally. That would normally count, but it's fine. Wherever it lands, you take it, going forward. Okay, so 25 to 20?
Sam: Oh, initiative?
Taliesin: Keep up, people! Come on.
Matt: You hear the gunshot. You're entering this intensity.
Sam: I don't think it's anything. I think it's just him tinkering.
Matt: So Scanlan stays behind. 25 to 20? 20 to 15? What are your scores?
Liam: 15.
Orion: 15.
Laura: 17.
Marisha: 16.
Travis: 16.
Taliesin: Thank you all, by the way, for leaving a bear on suicide watch. That was really cool.
Laura: You're welcome.
Matt: Vex, what'd you get again?
Travis: 17.
Laura: I got 17.
Sam: He got 15.
Matt: 15, Tiberius. And what'd you get, Vax?
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15, all right. Three 15s.
Sam: I got three.
Matt: You got three? Okay. All right, so you guys all spend your turn, if you choose to, to rush through the gates. As soon as the gunshots go off, you can see Shayne's up on top, and she sees it, gives a quick turn, and you can see the gates begin to open, and you hear this angry grunting as your half-orc guard is now pulling the doors open as fast as he can. You guys find a moment and slip through, running towards the front of the keep. You guys manage to get, with full dash and full turn, including your flight-- because you fly a little bit faster, but you have a little more of an arc to get over-- you guys get to the front of the keep this turn. So you won't get into this until next round. That brings it back to the top. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: (sighs) There's no way I can fire at the one who's far away from me right now, is there?
Matt: It's hard to see.
Laura: But Jarett's got him.
Taliesin: I can ignore cover, though.
Matt: You can ignore cover, but you have this entity in front of you. I mean, you'll be at disadvantage regardless, because you're shooting at something invisible, and you have something that's in melee of you and you have a ranged weapon.
Taliesin: I'm going to see if there's a charge left in my glove and try and take the-- there wouldn't be a charge left in my glove, would there?
Matt: You glance down at the glove, and you see the gemstone in the center of the palm is currently dark and lifeless.
Taliesin: Okay. (sighs) Hold on, sorry.
Travis: Fan the hammer, motherfuck.
Taliesin: It gets weird when it's up close. Okay. Let's see what we do. All right. There's no way I can step back right now, is there?
Matt: Currently? I mean, you can if you want to. It'll get a free strike on you.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to try and take shots, then.
Matt: The one in front of you? Okay. Go for it. With disadvantage on each shot.
Taliesin: Firing with disadvantage? Screw it, I'm going to take my first one with sharpshooter to see if I can do any damage that way. Nope. Actually, that's a misfire.
Matt: So Pepperbox (explosion sound). You go to shoot, and--
Marisha: (ricochet sound)
Matt: The barrel gets clogged, and the front of it actually catches fire for a second, and you have to shake it out right now. It's completely offset, and it's going to take a moment to even get it to where you can fire again.
Taliesin: Okay. Do I have six seconds?
Matt: You do. And you've used one attack. You have two more attacks.
Taliesin: Well, it misfired.
Matt: Yeah, that weapon you have to use an action to repair.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to do something a little weird. I'm going to pull out Bad News. I know I can't shoot this close with it, or god only knows what would happen. I'm going to try and swing it like a pugil stick, and I'm going to try and hit him with the butt of Bad News.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a melee attack. This is strength-based. Add your proficiency modifier and your strength modifier.
Taliesin: 15?
Matt: You still have disadvantage on it because you can't see it. And you're not proficient.
Taliesin: 15?
Matt: 15 just barely hits. (cheering)
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll-- with the size of Bad News, I'd say 1d6, plus your strength modifier.
Taliesin: Four.
Matt: Okay, so four points of damage, as you bludgeon it. You took a turn to get it out. Your third attack is then slamming it in the side. Whatever entity you smacked gets pushed against the wall. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.
Taliesin: 14.
Matt: Okay. So the impact does not appear to damage Bad News in this instance. It is a fragile construct, and even doing melee attacks with it does subject it to a misfire possibility.
Taliesin: I hit it with the stock, I was careful.
Matt: I know. Okay, so that concludes your turn?
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm kind of-- yeah.
Matt: Okay, you stay there. All right. The one that's in front of you now is going to go ahead and go over this way. Trinket-- well, no, it's still in melee, so it doesn't actually get an attack. It does get two strikes on you. That is a 17.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: And that is 18.
Taliesin: Armor class is 18.
Matt: So it does just hit you.
Taliesin: Can I do that crazy thing?
Matt: No, I've eliminated that.
Taliesin: Oh, you've removed that. Okay, never mind. I don't have the new update, sorry. I don't have a dodge anymore, right?
Matt: No, the dodge is not there. It rarely came into play. Okay, so that puts you at another 15 points of bludgeoning damage as it just smacks you right across the head. Your eyes go dizzy for a second, and you take a minute to refocus your vision, and you can now see in the air, the shimmering expression that looks like a humanoid face stretched and ghastly going (gasps) in front of you, but it's still barely even visible, and only because of the proximity to you are you able to actually make out any sort of shape or shimmer in the air in front of you. The other one is attempting to choke out the prisoner. However, the prisoner resists through athletics, so he's currently holding back at bay the strength of the entity. That ends its turn. Trinket's up.
Laura: Trinket's up! He's going to try to jump and land on top of the ghostly thing and bite its face. I don't know how to do that.
Matt: (laughs) To do a real leap, Trinket would have to back up and then run towards it. If Trinket wants to do that. Okay. So Trinket backs up. As it does, it gets one free swipe at Trinket. That is 18 to hit.
Laura: I'm having an issue here. Because I have 18 in parentheses, and then I wrote a 20 and I circled it and I don't know why.
Matt: I don't know why, either.
Laura: 18 is probably--
Matt: Yeah, we'll say 18. So that hits. Trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage as the entity swings out and backhands Trinket. However Trinket now leaps-- go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: He has better armor class than I do.
Sam: Does he have armor?
Laura: He does! He's got his bulette armor, man. He's a cannonball. What am I doing? A strength?
Matt: Athletics, yeah.
Laura: 17?
Matt: 17. Yeah. Trinket leaps forward, slamming this entity onto the ground and knocking it prone, and you get to go ahead and make a bite attack.
Laura: Yes! That didn't count because it slipped out of my hand. That was even worse than the other one. So 11. It slipped out of my hand. It shouldn't count if it goes like that! 20.
Matt: So Trinket manages to knock it prone, however, because it gets pushed out of the way, Trinket has a hard time, Trinket just makes a big slash and a bite out in the air where it once was and misses entirely.
Laura: But he's gone prone.
Matt: But he is knocked prone. Jarett's now going to attempt to grapple the entity.
Sam: Wait, Trinket missed? (ricochet sound) (laughter)
Matt: Jarett manages to reach out and grab onto whatever this creature is, hold onto it, just grappling, and is going to attempt to try and pull it back. For this, I will do a contested roll on that. It rolled a one. Jarett pulled it back that far, managing to let go of its quarry, and is currently holding onto some sort of angry, whirling entity at that point. That ends Jarett's turn. The rest of you guys all manage to make your way up into the armory up top. First is Vex. You rush in there, and what do you want to do?
Laura: I want to run down and shoot something.
Matt: Okay. You can get just about there.
Laura: Can I see anything? Can I ricochet an arrow to hit?
Matt: (laughs) I would say this guy has three-quarters cover, so it would be disadvantage on the attack. You already have disadvantage because it's invisible, so it's hard to hit, regardless.
Laura: That was the same one each time. 28.
Matt: 28? 28 hits.
Laura: Oh, I didn't fucking Hunter's Mark him. God damn it. Fuck. 15.
Matt: 15 points of damage. The first arrow sinks into whatever's there, and you can see it jutting out of no physical space.
Laura: Now I'm going to Hunter's Mark him and I'm going to hit him again. Can I do that?
Matt: Technically, it's part of your attack. You can do two attacks first, then you can bonus action, so you're like (arrow sounds) and then you Hunter's Mark it after.
Laura: All right. That one doesn't hit. Doesn't matter. Doesn't hit anyway. I missed it.
Sam: (ricochet sound)
Matt: Second shot shatters against the back wall of the stone. You can Hunter's Mark for your bonus.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: All right. Entity is now Hunter's Marked. That ends Vex's turn. Keyleth, you now also make your way into the doorway.
Marisha: How far can I get?
Matt: About there. Nothing's in visual sight right now, unfortunately.
Marisha: Nothing's in visual sight?
Matt: No, half of that was getting to that point. You could dash and try and make your way in, but you wouldn't be able to do anything.
Marisha: Can I dash and then make a bonus action?
Matt: You could, yeah. Your call. What do you got? Grog, you're on deck.
Marisha: I'll just wait.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth waits there. Grog, you're up.
Marisha: Let me just scootch over so I can be behind Vex.
Matt: You have a little better movement, so you actually manage to get two more squares in. What's your speed again?
Travis: 50.
Matt: 50? Yeah, you manage to get up to there, and now your turn begins.
Travis: I go into a rage, and I come in, and I turn to the right, and I run up as close as I can to Jared--
Laura: Jarett.
Travis: Yeah, Jarett. And wispy fuck.
Matt: All right, so you charge in. Angry, you see Jarett's currently reaching back and trying to go for his crossbow now that this entity's in his face. He's grappled it with one arm and he's reaching back to try and grab it. You come rushing in. Go for it.
Travis: I take out a holy oil vial out of the Bag of Holding, I crush it in my hand, and I take a swing at whatever he's holding.
Matt: All right. Cool. So as you pull out (glass breaking) the pain from the glass even further angers you in your rage. You can see a mix of holy water and blood trickle down from your fist as you clench it. Go ahead and swing for a punch with disadvantage.
Travis: That's a one.
Matt: So that first strike just whiffs over. Through your anger, you're unable to focus on where this entity may be.
Travis: Not off to a good start with this. Number two. Disadvantage. Fuck.
Matt: What's the total?
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15 just barely hits. Go ahead and roll.
Travis: One of these guys?
Matt: Go ahead and roll that. Half that damage, yes.
Travis: One. Plus rage, which is--
Matt: Plus strength.
Travis: Oh, right. Eight.
Matt: So eight points of damage to it. All righty. (whack) It hits, and you hear this (yelps) sound as it takes the impact, and you can see this strange, angry face appear suddenly out of the shimmering air that just then disperses again, and you don't quite know where it is. You can make a third strike now, if you want.
Laura: Did it do any holy damage?
Matt: Did not appear to have any additional effect on the entity.
Travis: Well, hell, it was worth a shot. Oh, at disadvantage. 19.
Matt: 19 still hits. Go ahead and roll the next attack.
Travis: Eight again.
Matt: Eight damage again. (whack) You backhand it with your third strike, this time finding the edge of its face again, and you see the chair right next to it tumble as it barely manages to catch itself and keep itself aloft. Nevertheless, this strange invisible entity is still there holding its ground.
Travis: Would you say the blood from my hand is splattering Jarett behind him?
Matt: You look over at Jarett. Jarett's currently trying to grab onto the creature and keep it grappled. So yeah, it's spattering on him.
Travis: I'm a painter.
Matt: (laughs) All right, that ends Grog's turn. Vax and Tiberius. You guys both get up to the edge of this room here.
Orion: Your cape is looking really nice, Vax.
Liam: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste, and I get double movement, so I get to go 60 feet. I'm going to slink up right beside Trinket and stab the shit out of this invisible thing.
Orion: Stab him! Hey, what do they look like?
Liam: So because Trinket's right there, this is a sneak attack. That hits. That is 29 to hit.
Matt: That'll hit. (laughter)
Matt: It is prone. It is invisible but it is prone, so that evens out to no advantage or disadvantage.
Liam: (counting) 25 for the first hit.
Matt: 25, all right.
Laura: Don't you double it? You had to double 19.
Liam: No, he didn't-- that's a critical hit.
Laura: Oh, right.
Liam: One shy. So now out comes the Dagger of Life-Stealing. It misses-- well, does 15 hit?
Matt: 15 just barely hits.
Liam: Just barely hits? Oh, that's better than I thought. That is three plus six is nine for damage, and then the Keen Dagger comes back, and that gets a 27, so that also hits for nine of damage.
Matt: All right. So as you rush over, you stab downward. You hear this (gurgle) sound as your blade comes down into whatever entity's there, and your hand moves around as it struggles against the blade. You pull it out, grab your other dagger, and then throw it in the air, catch it, slam it down again for that third strike, and then pull back and stab a third time.
Liam: And Trinket is very comforting, pressed against my shoulder as I do all that. He's supple.
Matt: Supple bear. #SuppleBear. All right, that ends your turn. Tiberius, what are you doing?
Orion: How far can I get?
Matt: That's about as far as you can get with your movement. You currently do not have visual on either of them. You're flying. What's your fly speed?
Orion: 60 feet.
Matt: You said that last time, and we found out it was 40, I believe wasn't it?
Orion: Was it 40? I thought it was 60. It was double the-- shit, hold on. I have a card--
Matt: You have a card and yet I find it faster.
Orion: 60 feet.
Matt: It is 60. You're right. Yeah, so you can go double. You are now just coasting down the stairway.
Orion: I'm going to attempt something I haven't actually tried before.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Orion: Because there's one to my right and one to my left, right?
Matt: Correct. There's one over here that has Grog and Jarett flanking. The other one has Percy, Vax, and Trinket all around it. That one's actually prone on the ground. It's hard to see normally; it's very hard to see now that it's swarmed.
Orion: Do I have visual of both wraiths?
Matt: You have visual of both entities, whatever they are.
Orion: Okay, sorry. I call them wraiths. Okay, so. I'm going to cast at--
Sam: Have we rested, by the way?
Matt: No, you have not rested yet.
Sam: So we're down a bunch of spells.
Matt: Yeah, you're still where you were when you came back.
Marisha: Well, to be fair, we talked. We didn't have a battle.
Sam: Some of us used spells. Fly and stuff.
Orion: I'm going to try to do this about now. I'm going to look to my right and my left and at 6th-level I'm going to try to do Glacial Blast and split the damage and try to hit both of them. Because it does 8d8 damage--
Matt: Are you doing this single-stream?
Orion: I'm trying to split my arc. So instead of doing this, I'm trying to-- (ice sounds)
Matt: Okay. How much damage is it?
Orion: At sixth level, it's 8d8 damage.
Matt: Okay, and what's the saving throw?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17, okay. Jarett and Vax have to make saving throws, as well. Go ahead and make that. Jarett rolled an 18 and has high dex, so yeah, Jarett makes his save. That's half-damage for Jarett.
Liam: 28 for me.
Matt: All right. So you take no damage, because you're a rogue. Go ahead and roll damage. That's 18 for one. This one fails, this one succeeds.
Orion: Cool. Right hand does-- oh, sweet.
Marisha: No. That's a d10. These are d8s.
Orion: Sorry, my bad.
Matt: It's actually not prone. They're immune to being prone.
Orion: Right hand-- that's 14 to my right, and then 18 to my left.
Matt: So how much is that?
Orion: So 14 to my right, 18 to my left.
Matt: Okay. Got you.
Orion: The one that doesn't save gets (freezing sound).
Matt: It would if it wasn't immune. However, as you arc down, the ice blast comes through. You can see Vax manages to pull down to the ground and get out of the way in time. Jarett ducks out of the way and it blasts over, hitting both these entities. Ice crackles around both their forms, but then the forms shift out of it. That ends your turn right there. Comes back to Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, where am I?
Matt: You are right there. Just entered the room behind everybody else.
Sam: Where does Percy do his tinkering?
Matt: Over here.
Sam: Because I can't see what's going on down there.
Matt: No, you just see, currently, these three down the hallway. You can just see Tiberius blast a bunch of ice, arc in the air.
Sam: Okay, so I know there's shit going on down there, but I can't really see what. So I would probably just Dimension Door into the tinkering room, because that's where I assume Percy is. And then I see what's going on, and nobody's there. Do I have line-of-sight on anybody?
Matt: Currently, you see Percy through this doorway right there.
Sam: Okay. Well, then. I can move also, can't I?
Matt: Yeah, Dimension Door is your action.
Sam: I'll move towards him. Oh, then I see a crazy thing in front of me. Shit. So I probably take a couple steps back. (laughter)
Sam: And then I'll inspire Percy. (sings) All the single Percys, all the single Percys.
All: (sing) All the single Percys, all the single Percys, put your guns up-up-up.
Matt: d10 inspiration dice to you, Percy.
Taliesin: What is that, a d10?
Matt: d10, yeah. That brings it to the top of the combat round. Percy, you're up first.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my action to try and clear my gun.
Matt: Okay. So go ahead and make your check.
Taliesin: What is that again? Did it change since last time?
Matt: That one shouldn't have changed, no.
Taliesin: Okay, so it's 11. I'm adding my bonus die. God damn it. Nine.
Matt: Nine. As you pull over your Pepperbox, you're like, (ping). The actual barrel comes off and hits the ground and rolls off toward the back of the room.
Taliesin: I'm tossing it into my room. I'm using an action surge. Actually, can I even do that? Yes, I'm going to use my action surge, and I'm going to walk over to the wraith on the ground, put the barrel of Bad News up to it, and pull the trigger.
Matt: The wraith is no longer on the ground, by the way.
Taliesin: Is he not?
Matt: The entity actually, upon looking, is immune to being prone. So we won't retcon anything, but as you go to pull the barrel up, you can see now the face is standing up before you.
Taliesin: I'm just going to try and shove it until I hit something and then pull.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll with disadvantage with Bad News.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Oh shit. We're all going to go deaf.
Laura: Oh man, that's going to be loud as fuck.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19. (gunshot) Bad News goes off. The sound is deafening in the room, the echoing of the explosion through the stone walls. I'm going to go ahead and have you roll a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Vax or Liam?
Matt: Vax. Both, maybe.
Liam: Roll a what now?
Matt: Constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: If you fail, I get to scream in your ear.
Liam: That is a 15.
Matt: 15, okay. You don't go deaf, but your ears are ringing very hard. The entity screams and then disperses.
Taliesin: I get a grit point back.
Marisha: You do! Dope.
Matt: Okay, so two more attacks. Or you have to use one to reload.
Taliesin: I have to use one to reload. I have one more attack, but I've already-- I didn't move. I'm going to try and roll around the corner and I'm going to take another shot. 27.
Matt: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: 19 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. This time (gunshot), the shot goes off right by your head, Tiberius. You're flying in the air and you look down and see him pull Bad News out right beneath you, and before you have a chance to react, (gunshot) the flash of the muzzle just bursting forward, a big plume of black powder smoke fills the air around you.
Orion: So I see a big flash? And what do I roll?
Matt: Make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Orion: Seven.
Matt: Okay, you are considered deaf until the start of his next turn.
Orion: Okay, so as soon as I see the flash, I go, (yelps). That's all I do. (laughter)
Matt: So that ends your turn, Percy? All right. Next, this entity that's Hunter's Marked is going to rush forward, straight out of the grapple from Jarett. Shifts right out of his hands. Is going to run forward and take the double attack against the prisoner. That's a 19 plus six. 25 hits. And 15 hits, as well. Takes 30 points of damage. Is currently unconscious. Punches him twice, and you see the poor driver is knocked up into the ceiling, falls down onto the bed, and is half-laying off. You see blood trickling down the front of his face, his eyes open, and slowly close.
Marisha: We need him alive.
Matt: That brings us to Trinket's turn.
Marisha: Come on, Trinket!
Laura: Trinket roars, rushes forward.
Matt: Actually, we're now going to roll Trinket into your turn.
Laura: Oh, all right. Then he stays there.
Matt: Okay. Trinket stays there until it's your turn. Jarett is going to rush forward and come to this corner. The crossbow is not much aid at this point. Reaches over and pulls out a short sword and lunges forward with the short sword. Yeah, with disadvantage, nine. Oh god. Rolls a 20 and a three. Great. Sorry, Jarett. Swinging through, trying to pierce through the bars at this entity, and can't seem to get any sort of attack to hit.
Laura: So he's actually locked in the thing still?
Matt: Jarett got the door open, he came through to try and grab the creature, and as he tried to pull it back, the creature sifted through his hands again to go ahead and attack the prisoner. That ends Jarett's turn. Vex, it is now your turn.
Laura: Okay. Can I move forward so I can see?
Matt: Yeah, you can see about there; it would give you visual on the entity.
Laura: All right. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll shoot him. He's Hunter's Marked already, okay, good.
Matt: He is, yes. So both attacks at disadvantage.
Laura: 15.
Matt: 15 hits. Just hits.
Laura: 16.
Matt: 16 also hits-- oh, 16 damage. All right. Including the additional Hunter's Mark?
Laura: Yes. And then 14 doesn't hit.
Matt: 14 does not hit. The arrow disappears in the back of the cell, scattering and shattering against part of the stone wall.
Laura: And Trinket, can he get up to him? Oh, but I took all the attacks.
Matt: Correct. So Trinket rushes up, but doesn't attack.
Laura: Trinket stays in the corner, then, because he can't do shit.
Matt: Okay. Trinket just cheers you on. (bear growl) Cool, that ends your turn. Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to-- seeing the direction that everyone's pointing, going to walk up and reach around Vex and I'm going to cast Faerie Fire right-- oh god, wrong direction. Right in the fucking eye. (laughter)
Liam: You turn on yourself.
Marisha: Crit fail. It's a 20-foot cube, so I want to cast it right in the cell.
Matt: Okay. So as you cast that, it's going to attempt to make its save. What's the DC on that?
Marisha: Against my spell's DC? 18.
Matt: And it fails with a 14. All right, so you guys watch as she reaches her hand out. The entire cell, all of a sudden there's a burst of purplish light, and these little dust-stars of purple glowing begin to drift down from the ceiling. As they do, they cling to whatever this form is, and you can now see, very clearly, this invisible entity that is surrounded in these purple sparkles. It looks humanoid from the torso up, but its legs are shimmering and shifting around. You now have a very clear look on it. You've nullified its invisibility.
Marisha: You have advantage now.
Matt: Gives advantage, as well? Yeah. You guys now all have advantage on this entity.
Marisha: And I'm going to take my bonus action to do Healing Word on the-- it's not Jarett that's unconscious, it's the cab driver. On the cab driver.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll for the Healing Word.
Sam: Desmond. Jarett and Desmond.
Matt: How much does he heal?
Marisha: Six plus my spell modifier. So ten? Is that right, is that how it works? Plus my spell level? Is that what it is with Healing Word?
Matt: I think it's plus five, whatever it is. Healing Word, yeah.
Marisha: 1d4 plus my spellcasting ability modifier.
Matt: So it's plus six.
Marisha: Six, so 12.
Matt: 12. Got you. Okay. Desmond's eyes clarify for a second and he begins to breathe heavily. Still looking very wounded, but conscious and prone across the bed, as the entity that's Hunter's Marked is still looming over it, bringing its fists up for another round to try and finish its job. That ends your turn, Keyleth. Grog, you're up.
Travis: There you are. Hold still, Casper! And I run up and I swing. (laughter)
Matt: As you rush up angrily, make your strike.
Travis: That's 28.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: That's a 27.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Those would hit Tiamat.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17 also hits, so roll damage three times. As you rush up, the bars open, bringing the axe down on top of this now sparkling purple entity.
Travis: Ten, so 14 on the first one, plus fire damage.
Matt: Cool.
Travis: 17 plus-- 21. No. Is that right? Did I do that right?
Laura: Yeah?
Travis: Yeah. So 21. The second one.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And 17, 21 again!
Matt: Nice! All righty, so you run up (hammer strikes) hammer down a third time, you can see its body being beaten around by the attack. And you see the whispering of its wind around its lower body is starting to slow, and it's looking like it's getting more sluggish, but it's definitely still intent on its job. That ends your turn, Grog. Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, in a split second I'm watching Grog take the thing apart. I size up everybody in front of me in the distance and I think I can Assassin Creed my way through the crowd because I can go 60 feet normally, so 30 feet if it's crowded, and I'm going to use Grog's proximity to take this thing apart.
Matt: Okay. I will say you would normally get advantage. Because you're attacking it through the bars, melee, it disables it, so it's just a straight attack. You're having to fight it through prison bars with daggers, which is difficult.
Liam: All right. So the first one is terrible, it's a 14.
Matt: 14 misses, unfortunately.
Liam: And that's where the sneak attack damage is, right?
Matt: Well, it's the first attack you get on it would get it. So even if you miss the first attack, you can still get it with the second and third.
Liam: All right. Third one is a 21.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: So there's the delivery system, and that is the Keen Dagger. 26, 27, 32. 38.
Matt: All right. With that, the first blade comes through and you try and get it through the bars and it gets nothing. You pull back, take the other dagger and swing through it. Falls too wide and you have to bring your arm back. This time, you can see after Grog has slammed it with the hammer, it falls. The sparkles come towards the edge. Its slamming its back into the bars. It's right there in front of you, and you use that instance to go ahead and reach through the bars, grab it by the throat, and stab it repeatedly, at which point its form disperses into wind around you.
Liam: And I slap Grog on the back and say, you softened the shit of him. That's terrible English. You softened him up for me! Asshole.
Travis: You've been drinking?
Laura: (giggling) You softened the shit of him.
Liam: You shitted him up for me, Grog. Good job.
Matt: You guys look over. You see Desmond is still on the bed, eyes wide (panting).
Orion: I rush over to Desmond, and out of my pouch I bring out a sandwich that I had made earlier. I hand it to him and I go, Desmond, decker. Here, have it. It's a decker sandwich. You should have it.
Matt: Gets up on the bed and takes it. "What happened?"
Laura: I run up and I cast Cure Wounds on him.
Matt: Okay. So go ahead and roll for the Cure Wounds heal on that.
Travis: You casting that all over the place now aren't you, fancy-pants?
Sam: From the tinkering room I yell out, is it safe? Can I come out now?
Orion: It's safe.
Liam: There's four more of them. Stay back.
Sam: Oh! Okay. I'll stay.
Travis: I remember I have the holy oil in my hand, mixed with the blood, and I start blessing him. With bloody fist.
Laura: 17.
Matt: All right, awesome.
Laura: Do I add my wisdom to that?
Matt: You add your wisdom modifier.
Laura: Then it's 20.
Matt: That's good to know. All right, cool. All right.
Orion: How's that sandwich?
Matt: Desmond isn't eating it. He's just holding it and still taking in. "What happened? What was that?! Look, what was that thing?"
Travis: Yeah, what was that thing?
Laura: What was that thing?
Orion: I would say opaque buttholes.
Marisha: Can we do a check?
Matt: Make an arcana check.
Taliesin: I'll make an arcana check, too.
Sam: How did you get two?
Orion: I rolled one by accident.
Matt: If you rolled by accident, you have to roll intentionally to take the score. Because if you were to accidentally roll really bad, you'd be like, "That doesn't count! I didn't actually roll."
Orion: A hard 12.
Matt: Total of 12?
Liam: I rolled a 22 arcana check.
Marisha: 22?
Laura: Oh, he's faced these things before. That's what it is.
Matt: That's the thing, you've seen these. These entities are used by certain high-level arcane practitioners. They can be summoned as certain spells. They're air elemental-based in nature, but they're generally known as invisible stalkers. They're used as assassins that have a very sole, single-minded purpose.
Liam: All I know is they feel like the Briarwoods.
Matt: You get that, based on recent events, there's probably a good probability that was the source of this.
Laura: Do you know from your previous experience if there's any way to protect against them? Other than setting up walls?
Liam: Well, all I know is how to stick my face in the beehives, apparently.
Laura: Does anybody know how to protect against air stalkers?
Orion: Give me a day, I will find out.
Matt: Jarett, at which point has put his hand against the wall, and goes, "Ugh. I would recommend that next time you decide to put me on watch, let me know if we're up against things that are invisible. I apologize. I was not prepared for such a foe to show up."
Laura: We were unprepared to warn you. I'm sorry.
Matt: "It's all right. If I might ask, what exactly are we up against here?"
Travis: Fuck if we know.
Orion: Seems like we're up against either vampires or liches. Prepare the troops. There will be some changes made to the keep over the next couple of days. We shall shore up security, as well.
Matt: "I would like also to consider possibly some changes made to our income, as this suddenly turned from a general guarding job to going up against the denizens of the afterlife. It's already been a very dangerous proposition."
Orion: Of course. We shall discuss that in the-- is it the morning?
Matt: "Very well. I'm going to go ahead and make sure the rest of my team is alive."
Liam: Jarett! Are you up for it?
Matt: "If the pay is good, yes."
Laura: Jarett's up for anything.
Matt: "You understand. Ugh, okay. Talk to you in the morning. I think a bit of rest is necessary." And he makes his way up the stairs to the rest of the keep. Desmond at this point is still in shock, and he starts absentmindedly eating the sandwich that you handed him.
Orion: It's good, right? I had one yesterday.
Laura: Well. Maybe it's best not to leave him down here.
Orion: No. You should stay in the guest room. Come.
Matt: "Is it safer there?"
Orion: Yes, it is.
Matt: "I told you they'd come for me. I told you they would."
Laura: But you know what! You're still alive.
Sam: You've had the worst couple of days.
Matt: Wipes the blood from the side of his face and looks at it.
Orion: Let's take you upstairs and get you all fitted... Who do we talk to that works for us that does the actual construction to the keep?
Laura: That is one of Uriel's staff. In which case, we cannot talk to them right now.
Matt: Yeah, the individual responsible for the construction of the keep was Lord Riskel Daxio, which is an elven gentleman on the Council that helped oversee the whole construction and helped you guys design it, so.
Liam: Is he still on the bed?
Matt: Still on the bed.
Liam: I sit down next to him and say, listen. You are a victim of circumstance, we understand that. We are, to a certain degree, as well. We're not leaving your side, and really there's no other choice. I mean, you're fucked like we are. So we will do our best to protect you, I promise you.
Matt: "Okay."
Travis: I volunteer to sleep down in the room.
Liam: Oh wow.
Orion: He shall stay in my quarters.
Travis: It's better down here, isn't it?
Liam: In a locked cell with Grog? I think is pretty safe.
Laura: I think it's probably better to bring him upstairs, because if it's locked, we can't get to him very quickly.
Orion: Don't worry, we can enchant his room, as well, to have an alert thing go on if anything happens in the room at night, and it would be safer. I shall be sleeping in my laboratory for the next several nights, as well.
Marisha: I mean, I can still go ahead and do the planar bindings to an elemental that maybe I should've done beforehand. It lasts 30 days.
Liam: I like all of these things, but I think Grog as a bunkmate is a good idea.
Matt: At this point, Desmond leans into you and quietly says in your ear, Vax, he goes, "Is where I'm sleeping going to be away from him?" He looks over towards Percy.
Travis: Yeah, totally away from him.
Marisha: It's fine. You'll have him in between you and him.
Matt: You don't hear that; it's whispered to Vax.
Liam: There is a lot of history for Percy wrapped up in this and he has done you wrong, no question. But the answer is yes. You will be separate from Percival. You will be protected. And you have my word.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: And you have my axe!
Liam: I'm going to use some Luck. Using my Luck. Natural 20, with Luck.
Matt: Takes another bite of the sandwich and packs it away in a little piece of cloth he had in a pocket, puts it in there. And you know, you can still see as he brings his hand up, you can see the blood streak against where the fingers were on the lower half of that hand. Strokes the edge of his chin and goes, "Okay. I trust you. Please. Please don't let them kill me."
Liam: We may be fuck-ups--
Orion: Speak for yourself.
Liam: But we're not without ability. You have my word. I promise you.
Matt: "Okay. I'm very tired."
Laura: Desmond, dear. Let's go upstairs. Grog! That bed needs to go back up to the guest room.
Travis: Fucking hell. I start to take the fucking bed up the stairs.
Matt: Takes you roughly another 20 minutes or so to bring it out of there, fitting it through the door.
Orion: Erwen! Where is that old man?
Matt: As you call out, Erwen eventually comes down. "Hi. Yes, Tiberius. You called? It's quite early in the morning." He has his night cap on and he's rubbing at his eyes.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: Right now, it's about probably 6 30 in the morning or so. It's just after sunrise; you guys haven't even slept yet.
Orion: Oh. Shit. Never mind, I'll talk to you once we've slept. Go back to sleep. I didn't realize what time it was! I thought it was 10:00 AM, which is totally different than 6:00 AM. I didn't know that.
Matt: "It's all right. All right. In the morning then, Master Tiberius." And he goes off to his bed to sleep.
Travis: We go to sleep?
Laura: Yeah, we need to sleep.
Sam: I gently fall asleep under Percy's workbench, where I've been hiding this whole time.
Matt: Okay, make a stealth check.
Taliesin: Not going to sleep down there.
Sam: Natural 20.
Matt: All right, so. As the rest of you go to sleep--
Taliesin: I'm going to go into my workshop.
Liam: On my way up, I fall in next to Keyleth. Ask, is your hand all right?
Marisha: It's fine.
Liam: Do you need anything?
Marisha: Nope.
Travis: Since he's sleeping in the room with me, I take a few of the caltrops that I have and I put them on the inside of the doorway before I close it.
Matt: Okay. So you guys are doing your setup there. Percy, you're in your workshop. Go ahead and roll a perception check, Percy.
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: 17. Okay. You go about your work.
Taliesin: I'm fixing my gun.
Matt: Okay. The materials that it requires you to do so are expensive, you actually have to pay the cost of the gun, and go ahead and make another check.
Sam: The fuck is that sound?
Matt: So go ahead and make another tinkering check. And the cost of the Pepperbox should be at the bottom of your--
Taliesin: Is it the whole cost or half?
Matt: Should be half the cost. It should say under the repair rules for a misfire.
Taliesin: Half cost. Oh my god, that's awful. Okay, tinkering check. 12.
Matt: 12. Okay.
Taliesin: Technically, that would be a success.
Matt: Yeah. So you take the rest of the morning, unsleeping, the dark bags under your eyes. You manage to get the Pepperbox back in working order.
Taliesin: Oh, I was asleep. I wasn't with them, so I just woke up really early.
Matt: Right, right. But even so, even though you slept, it hasn't been very restful. It's been technically enough to rest, but your evening has been fraught with nightmares. Perpetually. But your Pepperbox is repaired, and does cost you half the cost of the weapon cost to repair.
Taliesin: 75 gold.
Orion: I sleep in my little nook in my laboratory.
Matt: Okay. You guys rest through the rest of the morning, waking up past noon, probably about 2:00 in the afternoon. You all gradually begin to come to consciousness. Make your way downstairs. As you come downstairs, you can already smell breakfast has been prepared. You can see Laina already has the meal set out for you, and as you guys approach, "Oh it's so nice of all of you to come down! It was very interesting. These very nice folks came by this morning and dropped off a whole bunch of food and fresh veggies and stuff. Makes for a great meal. It was very nice of them. Food is served." And she gives out the plates and gives you a smile.
Travis: I love you. (eating noises)
Liam: Is this a frittata?
Matt: "I believe that's what it's called in some circles. I'm trying a few new things!"
Travis: Can I make a beard check?
Orion: I'm going to take some food and feed it to Lockheed and roll for my animal handling for the day.
Travis: 66.
Matt: No effect, unfortunately.
Travis: Just a little tingle?
Matt: There is a slight tingle, but it's mostly a placebo. (laughter)
Matt: As you guys are having your meals and you're trying and you're feeding food, teaching this, everyone roll a perception check.
Liam: At home?
Orion: 16!
Liam: I rolled a one.
Marisha: 17.
Liam: This frittata is lovely.
Sam: Six.
Travis: Eight.
Laura: 16. But my passive is 21.
Matt: Right, understood. Good to know. Percy's down in his workshop. As you guys are in the middle of your meal, you hear, clearing the stillness and quiet of the low munching-up, (clears throat) and sitting at the table adjacent to you guys, completely unnoticed in his entry, is Seeker Asum, arms crossed.
Laura: Motherfucker, you are sneaky! I need to talk to you.
Travis: We are not cool right now.
Matt: "Well, obviously not. That's why I'm here to have a conversation with the rest of you. Please continue to eat. I don't mean to disturb you."
Orion: Oh, very well.
Laura: Help yourself to a frittata.
Matt: "I've already eaten, but I appreciate the offer."
Orion: Try this hakuna frittata. It's really good!
Travis: Hakuna matata?
Laura: Let him talk.
Matt: "What a wonderful meal. Well, things have certainly gotten sticky, haven't they? Well, first and foremost, I would like to thank you, Keyleth, for clearing my head. Lord Briarwood had locked me into some form of mental charm during my attempt to aid Vax--"
Marisha: I told you it worked! Sorry, I'm a little defensive right now. Continue.
Matt: "That's all right. Things are a bit mixed up. It's hard to explain; let's just say I have been clouded in my judgment for the past few days until you cleansed me. I'm sorry to uphold the charade back in the palace."
Liam: Apologies are mine, I think. I believe you had some sort of plan, and I thought I knew better, and for that I'm sorry.
Matt: "I cannot say that is untrue. But I accept your apology."
Laura: Can I roll for insight?
Matt: You may.
Liam: Roll high!
Laura: I know! That was a shit roll. Nine.
Matt: He's a hard person to gauge, anyway. You gathered over time that most of his work deals in a network of spies and the gathering of information across all of Tal'Dorei, so he is very well-trained to hide the essence of his true nature and the intent. Hard to read. But he seems pleasant as he's been, and given the circumstances. "Nevertheless, I accept your apology, and I apologize for having upheld the charade during the council meeting, but I had to keep up appearances so as not to cause any sort of stir at the time. I fear, based on my observations since, that our very own sovereign also fell to the same charm I did and has been clouded since the dinner the night before."
Laura: Shit! That makes sense.
Marisha: We were afraid of that.
Sam: He's fallen for that stuff before.
Matt: "He's been through quite a bit, and while he's a resolute and a very good man, I would say that he is predisposed to outer influence from those that are quite strong-willed."
Sam: And this is why you kept up our accusations against us in front of him?
Matt: "Under those conditions, the room filled with guards that were all intent against keeping you at bay. Should you have made any attempt to try and cleanse him as well during that time, I think you all would have wound up in prison. Or worse."
Marisha: So why didn't you want to show that you were also cleansed? What was the point of holding up the charade?
Matt: "Because when you're under this influence, to speak against the proposed ally of the charm is to draw a line. I wish to stay in his good graces because that would enable us a much better chance of getting you close enough to him to absolve him of this charm. If I was to reveal this instantaneously in the presence of the entire council, I fear that might have put me in the same court of disfavor as you and lost any future chance of expelling this influence."
Laura: Do you it's only Uriel, or do you think it's the rest of the council as well?
Matt: "Best I can gather, most of the council is not as well-- how do I put it? Not used to business with Vox Machina. Allura seems to be of clear mind, as she is very powerfully protected against such influences and did not have any immediate interaction with the Briarwoods during that dinner. I fear the intent was on the sovereign himself."
Sam: Wait, are you saying that the Briarwoods corrupted him?
Matt: "Same way they corrupted me."
Sam: During the dinner? While we were all sitting there?
Matt: "Apparently, it takes naught but a glance."
Laura: Oh shit! They could have gotten any of us.
Orion: Yes. They did. Me. It was rather inconvenient. I hate them. Sorry.
Matt: "I think we have something in common."
Sam: Aren't you deaf?
Liam: No, that was brief.
Orion: I mean, what?
Sam: Is that why you're talking so loud?
Orion: Yes. I was getting it back.
Matt: "There are a few options at our disposal. You could continue to work to clear your name, during his distraction southward, if you have some idea as to how we could get close enough to him to absolve him of this now, that would leave the risk of, should anything go poorly, being poked with many spear holes."
Laura: Is it possible to sneak into his room, and restore him without anybody knowing?
Matt: "If you're confident. That may be more of a mission for the quieter of your bunch, should they be a little more intelligent with their actions, going forward."
Orion: What about drawing him out to a luncheon or whatnot?
Matt: "I will say, based on recent circumstances, he is very careful and defensive."
Liam: I have fair chances of getting in, but no ability to cure him of any such thing.
Laura: What if Keyleth, who can do it, polymorphed into a fly or a very small creature, traveled on you, you snuck in, she popped out, did the thing. Money.
Sam: (laughs) Unless they're caught, in which case, you've got two of our members against the entire palace guard.
Laura: So then you go with them and Dimension Door out.
Sam: I didn't even want to face the little invisible thing downstairs!
Orion: Why don't we hold a special dinner?
Sam: He hates our fucking guts.
Travis: Why don't we let Seeker Asum finish?
Sam: Seeker Asum, in your opinion, is it safer to try and heal him or to try and clear our name through the traditional legal means?
Matt: "Honestly, I have no idea. I think this plan, if successful, is quite inspired. However, failure would probably end in the immediate incarceration and/or death of both individuals involved. Public execution does not befit the country-wide name of Vox Machina, if you were to fail. If you were to succeed, that would be the most direct route between two points."
Marisha: So are we in agreement that we have to clear Uriel's mind first?
Sam: No. No, the other option is to clear our names and not worry about clearing his mind.
Laura: Uriel, if he's got his mind controlled, it doesn't matter if we try to clear our names, he's going to find us guilty.
Sam: But during our trial, we will have a direct line of sight to him, we might be able to get through to him.
Liam: Does he still trust Allura?
Matt: "As far as I know, yes."
Travis: You know, if we kill the Briarwoods, is this even a point?
Sam: That's true. He doesn't trust Allura, she wasn't even allowed in the room to talk to us. There's definitely suspicion there, right?
Liam: He did. He did question her allegiances.
Matt: "If that's the case, then perhaps her current power is not as strong in the council when regarding you. But she is still a member of the council, should she not be immediately affiliated with you for her purposes. This is up to you. Whatever you choose to do, if it requires my aid, I will give it a day before I have to leave. My next intent is to head-- well, I wish to go past the eastern curtain set up by Whitestone into Wildemount. I have spent the better part of the past day since the cleansing seeking all records of the Briarwoods and their doings. There was a period of about eight years in which there is no public record of their goings-on. It appears that most records that deal with their involvement in Wildemount, and whatever homestead gave them their title, Lord and Lady Briarwood, has all been but erased. So I intend to go to the source, Wildemount itself, and research. This will take me some time, of course."
Orion: When do you plan on leaving?
Matt: "Sooner the better. I was thinking tomorrow."
Marisha: Is Percy here? Is Percy in the room?
Matt: Percy is not even here. Percy is down in the workshop.
Marisha: I go get Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I was going to be at the door.
Marisha: Oh. I come around the corner, and I see Percy.
Matt: As you come around the corner, Percy is currently leaning up against the side of the wall, listening in to the conversation.
Marisha: Hey! I was looking for you. You want to come and actually join the conversation for once, instead of sitting outside the door and just listening to them? Because I really feel like this is going to be your time to input and maybe really help?
Taliesin: I don't feel like doing that. Oh. Lead on.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Seeker Asum, we have managed to capture and keep one of the coachmen. Down in our cell. Would he be safer in our hands, or within the castle walls?
Marisha: Percy and I walk in.
Travis: I'm fucking asking.
Matt: "Well, that depends. If you have strong defenses, and the enemy has no means of entering, then he will be safer here. The palace itself is a very well-protected area; however, there currently is an open invitation into the palace, and if the essence of our enemy is as I think it is, then they can enter whenever they like."
Travis: Never mind.
Liam: I think we're really choosing between two paths here. Either we stay in town and tinker and gamble, or we're runaways.
Sam: Runaways? No, we go to the Briarwoods--
Liam: That's what I'm talking about. The minute we leave, we're outlaws. They've told us not to go.
Orion: We can leave, we just cannot flee. We can travel as we see fit. We just need to let them know where we're going.
Liam: Yeah, but we can't tell them 'we're going to check out your associates'.
Travis: Yeah, we lie.
Marisha: Wait, what's the name of the town?
Sam: Whitestone?
Marisha: Not Whitestone. Oh, I thought he was saying he was going to go to their hometown.
Matt: He's going to Wildemount, the kingdom that they're originally from. The continent to the far east.
Marisha: He's not going to Whitestone. He's going to go to Wildemount, which is on another continent. If we go to another continent, it doesn't matter if we're fleeing or not. It's going to look like fleeing.
Travis: Why are you going to Wildemount, again?
Matt: "I'm trying to find as much information to incriminate them in case whatever you're attempting does not work."
Orion: Seeker, would you mind staying for a week or so before your venture? We need time to convince the council to let us leave without conflict and to procure particular items and things that we need. Very briefly. Would just take some time.
Matt: "I have already made arrangements for travel. I could try, but depends on what you need me here for."
Travis: What do we need him here for?
Orion: Ultimately, protection or a good ear.
Marisha: Do you genuinely think they're going to let us go with permission? We're not on their good side.
Laura: No, they're not. They're not going to let us go.
Liam: We're going to be outlaws. We have to clear ourselves by ending the charm on Uriel by finishing off Sylas.
Sam: Or by killing the Briarwoods, thus ending the charm.
Liam: Sylas Briarwood.
Matt: "So that would be a way to clear your name and clear his head."
Travis: Let's do that.
Sam: Percival--
Orion: What of eight days instead of two weeks? Oh, sorry.
Sam: Percival, what do you think we should do? Go seek revenge on your family and get some blood on our hands, Briarwood blood? Or do the sneaky thing and try to--
Laura: Please, we need your input.
Marisha: You know them better than anyone.
Taliesin: I really don't. I think we're here because I wasn't prepared.
Marisha: Can I do an insight check on him? See if he knows more than what he's saying?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: You can go ahead and roll a d20.
Marisha: Is that a nine?
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: Is there anything you're holding back?
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: He seems clear as day, telling the honest truth.
Liam: I don't think we're here in this city to become lords and ladies serving Uriel, as good a man he is. I think Percival's our ally, and this is a grievous wrong done to him, and we can kill two birds with one stone.
Taliesin: I think we are in the situation we're in because we now know how much we don't know. How much I don't know. I'm not prepared. If we face them now, I'm going to get you all killed.
Orion: I agree. We need proper preparation. Percy, I'm pretty sure you have a good background on vampires and what-have-you, as do I, as I've researched them in the last couple of days. There's other things that we should research, as well, and probably arm ourselves for that kind of conflict, if it comes to it. Quite frankly, I have a feeling if it's the whole town we're dealing with, we need to find out how many innocents there are to save, and if the number is low enough, we can fly in with an army ourselves, which would take some time. The Draconian Knights. I am an ambassador to Draconia, officially, after all the assistance I've sent, in giving them the Wheel of Mending, and proving my point.
Laura: You gave them the Wheel?
Orion: No, I showed it to them, proving that my quest was true, which they gave me full ambassadorship, which means that, if harm comes to a Stormwind, harm comes to all of Draconia. And a town full of vampires and liches--
Laura: I didn't know we had a whole army at our disposal. That's wonderful to hear.
Orion: If worse comes to worst.
Liam: Started on the bottom, now we're here.
Sam: Diplomatic immunity.
Orion: Even then, our relations must be strong with Emon. We need their allyship, as well. Draconia will not go into things alone. We need a union.
Marisha: I agree. While we're not serving Uriel, that's not our purpose, I also don't want to leave an enemy of the state. That's not good for me, for what I want.
Orion: I go up to Jarett. Eight days. What do you think of eight days?
Marisha: And what, go with Jarett? Not Jarett, Asum.
Sam: He's not even going where we would be going. We would be going to Whitestone, right? That's where the Briarwoods are.
Liam: But Keyleth, Uriel is the law, and the law is now corrupt.
Marisha: Then why don't we save his mind before we go?
Laura: Here's the thing. He's going to find out stuff about the Briarwoods. What's the fucking point of him going if we're just going to go attack the Briarwoods before we know what he knows? We need to let him go, find out his shit, take care of Uriel, wait until he gets back, go take out the Briarwoods--
Orion: As Vex is saying this, Tiberius is getting a half-chub.
Travis: A what?
Laura: A what?
Taliesin: Well, that's just weird.
Orion: You can't see it because it's inside.
Liam: Yes, but you said it out loud.
Matt: Anyway.
Orion: I'm just saying.
Sam: It's a strategy boner?
Liam: It's a strategy chub, all right.
Taliesin: I'm still weirded out.
Marisha: You've got to give context to those things, man.
Liam: It's an odd choice of words, but now 30 seconds later, I see what you mean
Orion: Sorry. Her brain. That's what I'm talking about.
Matt: Asum says, "My getting to Wildemount is not easy, nor is it safe. I cannot linger for long. Maybe a few days."
Taliesin: How soon will you return?
Matt: "That depends on if I even return. Every spy I've sent to seek information on the Briarwoods or to Whitestone has not come back."
Orion: (ripping noises) I'll give him two strips of Scroll of Telescription. If any harm falls upon you, write on this. I explain what it does.
Matt: Okay. How many of those do you have left, by the way?
Orion: I have 30 tickets left, so 28 now.
Liam: I have another idea. Uriel said that-- he was resistant, but he said that he would bring me in to have his people check me out. Check out my story. What if Keyleth and Scanlan rode in my pockets--
Sam: I'm not that small.
Laura: As roaches.
Liam: You're pretty small. Just as mice.
Laura: Or bugs. Roly-polies!
Liam: Magic user's choice. Can you cast magic when you're transformed?
Sam: No.
Laura: So they'd have to pop out. Can you shrink yourself and still do magic teeny-tiny?
Sam: Are you asking me?
Laura: Either of you.
Sam: No, but I can shit on things. Yes?
Orion: Can you give the Seeker an inspiration before he goes on an adventure?
Sam: It could last him 20 minutes, yes. Get him to the docks, maybe.
Laura: Seeker, what do you think? What was your goal of coming here?
Travis: Yeah, do you want us to come with you or what?
Matt: "My journey requires the utmost of silence, speed, stealth, and I mean no offense to your entourage, but I think I can do this alone, and should. However, this journey may take me two weeks, a month, many months-- I do not know. I'm doing this just in case whatever you're choosing to do fails. At least, if Vox Machina falls in this, I can come back with proof enough to try, and once the army has been gathered, perhaps we can rally all of Emon against Whitestone."
Travis: If you die, can you write a letter and sign your name saying that we were right, you were wrong, you were full of shit, the Briarwoods are assholes--
Orion: But a lot more eloquently than that.
Travis: Or not.
Matt: "I can try my best."
Laura: That would be lovely.
Marisha: I go up to his arm, and I Druidcraft a wooden armband. Make it look cool. And put that on him.
Sam: Onto Tiberius?
Marisha: No, onto Asum. Now I can scry through that. That way I can at least check in on you every once in a while. If you're okay with that?
Sam: I could've shat on him and had the same effect.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: What about being invisible? Can you cast spells while you're invisible?
Orion: Only with Greater Invisibility, you can.
Marisha: 21.
Sam: We've always sought out the path of the most glory, and I think that that is the Briarwoods. Going into a giant, vampire-lich-ridden castle and killing two evil bastards amid their army of protectors is the coolest thing we could ever do.
Laura: It's super-duper cool. Here's the thing it's not going to be just two, I don't think. It's going to be an entire town of people that they've controlled.
Sam: You think we can get into Sovereign Uriel without anyone detecting magic on us? He's got clerics all round him--
Laura: Yeah, but Seeker Asum knows all the ins and outs of the palace.
Liam: He's leaving town tomorrow.
Laura: We'd have to do it stat, but he knows how to get in.
Marisha: He did say it was an inspired idea. His words.
Matt: "Regardless, you have to make a choice soon. I cannot dilly-dally. I'll take your band, yes." He takes the wooden band and puts it around his arm and says, "If this will put you at ease, I'll take it."
Marisha: Don't worry. I won't abuse it, I promise. Could you potentially help us with sneaking in the castle?
Matt: "I could get you in the door, but I could not escort you to that room. That would put myself in extreme danger and the entirety of our mission."
Laura: Could you distract people?
Matt: (laughs) "I can do that quite well, yes."
Sam: We can get there, but something tells me we're still going to be fighting a big fight in a palace. I'd rather fight that big fight in the Briarwoods'.
Liam: Scanlan and I are in agreement, and here's the problem. If things go south in Uriel's palace, we are then forced to fight against people who are good and true, or give up and go to jail, which sucks.
Sam: But in the Briarwoods', we can kill every motherfucker in that place.
Orion: There are a number of innocents that we need to figure out, still.
Marisha: What if we talk to Allura?
Sam: You killed an old lady!
Orion: She attacked us! And I will not back down from that decision.
Sam: She did have an old lady smell.
Travis: All right. Can we just vote on something, please? Since Percy's being oh-so-quiet about all this.
Marisha: Percy is being very quiet about this.
Travis: Are you sure you have nothing to say?
Laura: It's fucking your family. It's the people that attacked your family. Do you have no contribution to this?
Taliesin: I still feel I owe everybody an apology. I still feel terrible about dragging you all into this and putting you in danger.
Laura: We're choosing to do it.
Matt: "Vengeance." A voice whispers in your ear, Percy. No one hears this. "Vengeance."
Taliesin: If you're with me, we can be prepared for them this time. We know enough to prepare ourselves, we can have ourselves ready this time.
Orion: How many days do we have? I would like eight days to prepare.
Marisha: Can I see if he looks like shaken or fucked up at all?
Matt: I mean, he looks shaken and fucked up, yeah. He's obviously had a horrible few days.
Taliesin: I think a week to prepare is reasonable.
Laura: And then leave.
Taliesin: And then we leave. We leave quietly.
Marisha: Wait, we're leaving to Whitestone?
Travis: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: I've been avoiding it for too long, and now I know too much.
Liam: The law of this land is compromised. Percival, I agree with you. I think this is the right choice.
Travis: All in favor, say aye.
All - orion: Aye.
Travis: All opposed, say nay. Nice.
Matt: "Then it is settled. I'll be on my way."
Laura: Wait! Before you go, could I talk to you?
Matt: "Certainly."
Laura: Were you going to say anything else? Because I'll talk to you in private.
Matt: "Three days and I'll be off on my side of the mission. Very well."
Laura: I'll follow you out.
Matt: Yes, and he walks out, walks with you.
Taliesin: Hold on, I'm going to hold you before you go. I just wanted to say, I'm so sorry and thank you. And thank you for doing this for me. I fear my temper before this weight is lifted from my heart. I do not wish to lose myself like that again, and I am so sorry for everything I've done.
Orion: Tiberius puts his hand on Percy's shoulder, and go, I'm sorry for the tragedy which is your family, and what these Briarwoods have befallen to them, and I will promise you, I will do my best to have you give that final blow from that barrel to the names assigned to them. But now it is a far dangerous situation, as you very well know.
Taliesin: I will do my best to maintain myself. I apologize.
Matt: And as you all scatter, Percy, as you walk out, the same voice creeps into your ear, "Yes." Now, as you step out with Seeker Asum, who now has a bit of haste to his step, arms crossed, looking around. "So you wish to speak with me?"
Laura: Yes, I do. You're a ranger.
Matt: "I am."
Laura: You're very sneaky.
Matt: "I can be."
Laura: I've only ever seen people like thieves, like my brother, do things like you've done. Can you teach me anything that you know to help me maybe be a little more stealthy, as well?
Matt: (sighs) "We'll go over what you know, and perhaps there are a few tricks that I can teach you in the three days I have. I can't guarantee that it'll be extremely changing, as that's a very short time to train over what I've learned over a lifetime, but I can certainly attempt."
Laura: I appreciate it.
Matt: "I require your concentration for those days, though, before I leave."
Laura: Utmost.
Matt: "All right. Meet me at the morrow, crack of dawn. I'll be at the front of your keep."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "Very well." And he heads off, outside of the keep. The rest of you, what are you doing?
Orion: I go to my laboratory.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: About 3 00, 4 00 in the afternoon now.
Travis: That temple of Sarenrae is in the city.
Matt: It's part of the keep, yeah. Oh, you mean the actual temple you went to? That is inside the city, yes. You can go into the city; you just can't get to the Cloudtop District.
Orion: Use the earring real quick. I'm going to write a quick letter. If anybody goes shopping, let me know.
Matt: Tiberius loves shopping.
Laura: He really, really does.
Matt: All right, we'll go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be back in five minutes. Keep it a stringent break, guys.
Liam: So errands will happen after that break? Because I have some errands that I want to do.
Matt: Yes. We'll try to keep the errands pretty concise so we can keep on schedule, yeah, so it's like, use this break to conjecture exactly what you want to do. All right, guys, we'll see you back here in five minutes. [break]
Matt: Welcome back. So to try and expedite this, over the next period of time you guys want to take to prepare, what are you going to do? Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to finish up those things that we talked about earlier, spend some time making some ammunition, and I'm going to attempt to build what we were talking about earlier.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a tinkering check for your ammunition.
Marisha: What we were talking about? Can I help him with that? Can I assist him?
Matt: I would say the tinkering, the mechanisms involved, would be so far beyond your understanding as a druid. Even just metalwork in general. You can cheer him on, but would not be able to assist him with it.
Marisha: Go Percy, go! That's pretty good.
Taliesin: 24.
Matt: 24? Okay. You manage to produce 25 rounds for your Pepperbox and ten rounds for the Bad News.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Marisha: You still have inspiration from Scanlan?
Taliesin: No, I used that.
Matt: Used that to repair his Pepperbox. Roll for the secondary construction. Smoke bombs.
Taliesin: Okay. 11.
Matt: 11. You take a better part of two days attempting to get these to work, and most of your materials are ruined, unfortunately. You manage to come out with it with, and I want you to write this down, "smoke bomb, question mark." It may function. We will see upon use. But you have one at your disposal that is questionable. However, for the cost of the ammunition and the cost of the smoke bomb's construction, already that comes to about, I'd say 75 gold pieces, so mark that off. And you're attempting to make, you're attempting to make, based on what you told me, an Archimedes death ray.
Taliesin: They're not hard. I say that as, like, knowing my actual skill level, I could make one.
Matt: You could. To be functional with the materials that are at your disposal, it's going to be very large and hard to move.
Marisha: We were talking about making it collapsible.
Taliesin: I could make a collapsible one, where it's basically a one-third dodecahedron, like an observatory.
Matt: You spend the remainder of this week of preparation. Go ahead and roll your tinkering check. This is going to cost you in materials.
Orion: Wait, hold on, can I pause real quick? You don't need to do this if you want to make more ammo and other stuff. I can do this without you making this and spending the rest of the time, if you want to make other stuff. Option.
Matt: What do you want to do?
Taliesin: Story-wise it's more amusing.
Matt: Okay, go for it. All right, so. The actual materials for this--
Taliesin: It's copper.
Matt: I know, it's copper, but the actual dodecahedron that's involved, the mirrors, the lenses, the whole thing? In order to be of the scale and quality to even make it even remotely functional, all of it for the extremely high quality and some of it custom-made within the first couple days within this, with a rush order. I'd say the total cost is going to come to about 1,200 gold pieces.
Marisha: I'll pitch in for that. How much do you have?
Taliesin: At this point I have less than 100 gold.
Marisha: You have less than 100 gold? I'll pay for it in full.
Orion: What is the diameter of this?
Matt: The actual focal lens is about this big. The whole construct can be carried by two people.
Taliesin: But it will fold.
Orion: I was just going to say, what's the radius of the actual thing's lens?
Matt: Of the lens itself? This is the radius of the lens. I mean, even when it's collapsed, it can be carried by one person, but it's still a heavy mechanism.
Orion: So it's only one foot? Two feet? Three feet?
Matt: I'd say it's about two and a half feet in diameter.
Orion: Are you sure you want to do that?
Matt: He's already agreed. Go ahead and roll.
Marisha: Why? It's fine. This is what we were talking about.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. Through the materials and the construct of it, you get partway through the final stages of it, and as you're tightening one of the sections, all of a sudden there's a (cracking) sound. Your whole body freezes as you glance over. the lens itself has a giant crack through it.
Taliesin: There shouldn't be a glass piece-- aw, man.
Matt: For the construct for this one, there was a focusing lens that is part of what the initial blast, otherwise there wouldn't be a point of actually projecting a ray from.
Orion: I thought they were all mirrors.
Matt: There's all different sorts of construction based on. This one's the one we're going on here, or if you can say the center of it is a gem, but regardless, the tinkering roll was not high enough to construct the device. Sorry.
Marisha: The whole thing's wasted? Can we try and repair the crack?
Matt: It's not something you can repair. The entire piece is constructed from a solid piece.
Taliesin: What, could we put it on the Mending Wheel?
Matt: You could attempt to.
Orion: (grunting) Let's see. Okay. (clicking noise)
Travis: I want to go to the store. I would like to get a shovel and a pickaxe.
Orion: You going to Gilmore's? We're going to Gilmore's, too. We could go together if you're doing that.
Travis: I don't give a fuck where we go. Just a shovel and a pickaxe.
Matt: Pickaxe... comes to four gold pieces for the two of those. You got them. Make a secondary tinkering check.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. This time you go back and as you're tightening it, the actual metal housing of the device ends up bending in a way that both cracks the gem and causes the frame itself to be dented to the point where the beam will be imperfect. This is a very hard thing that you've come up with in your mind that has not been constructed before, and the level of difficulty to create this is very difficult. It does not cost you additional money, thanks to the Mending Wheel, but right now the entire device looks like to continue, it's going to take more time and money to construct it.
Taliesin: (sighs) I can always use this for spare parts for other things.
Laura: You're already 1,200 in? How much more would you have to put in?
Matt: I'd say about half the cost. An additional 600.
Marisha: And how many more days?
Matt: Two more days.
Marisha: How many more days do we have?
Matt: You agreed upon eight, so we'd be pushing about seven, then.
Taliesin: I've already built a smoke bomb and some rounds of bullets. All right, I'll put a little more time in this. Can I get some inspiration for this, too, if that would be possible?
Liam: Music, you mean?
Marisha: There's nothing I can do to help him?
Matt: Unfortunately-- what's your intellect?
Marisha: My intellect? I've got plus three.
Sam: (singing) Here comes the sun--
All: (singing) It's all right. (vocalizing)
Liam: (singing) Kill the vampire.
Marisha: Come on, come on.
Taliesin: Come on, come on.
Marisha: Percy roll. Come on.
Taliesin: 23?
Matt: Working on the device a third time, you get it right to the point where you think it could work and you go to set it up, and as you do, you find that the light focuses in a way that actually slowly melts the copper on the outside of the housing of the device, and it begins to melt onto itself, and you have to pull it out of the light. This design is beyond your grasp right now. You're inventing something that takes quite a lot of time to eventually perfect.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to put these away for a later time, and if I have one more day, I would like to work on--
Marisha: Maybe a version of it that is not collapsible that we can at least mount?
Taliesin: We've got it taken care of.
Matt: That's been your guys' week.
Taliesin: That's my week, okay.
Matt: Okay. You bought your pickaxe and your shovel. Cool. Vex, what are you doing?
Laura: I'm training.
Matt: You're training, okay.
Liam: All right. I want to be brief. I have four things I want to do, but I'll be very brief. I promise. Okay, so first thing I want to do is I think at some point, I heard Tiberius talking about wooden stakes and vampires. So I want to go buy about ten wooden stakes.
Orion: I give him extra. Get me 20.
Liam: I'm going shopping.
Laura: Yes, get me some holy arrows.
Liam: Can I get a loaner on that? I've got about 230 gold.
Travis: I thought you said you were going to be brief. (laughs)
Liam: On my own.
Marisha: I thought we got a bit of an allowance.
Liam: It's a week, so I get some gold from these people and I go and I don't even know what they said. I'm getting ten wooden stakes for myself.
Matt: 20, technically, because Tiberius requested ten. Those will cost you a total of two gold.
Liam: That's what I thought. And what did you want?
Laura: I wanted some holy arrows.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Or holy water. Try to get some holy water. Holy oil.
Liam: I'll get to that. Investigation, you say? That is a 13.
Matt: 13. Asking around the town  holy arrows, that is an enchantment. They're pricey and they don't appear to be anywhere in the major shops, even shops like Gilmore's, that they specialize in. It's usually a special order-type thing. Holy water flasks can be purchased at 20 gold apiece.
Liam: I'll get to that. All right, so we got wood. That was two gold, you said. All right, minus two. The next thing I want to do is go to the temple of Sarenrae and get my sister's holy oil for her. How much is that?
Matt: Holy oil? As opposed to the holy water?
Liam: I'll take both, if you've got it.
Matt: Well, holy oil is a more expensive version. Holy water is a one-use. Holy oil can be applied to a weapon.
Liam: Holy oil.
Orion: How much do the stakes weigh? Like each stake?
Matt: A cluster of ten, if that's what you wanted, would weigh about five pounds. But they're relatively light.
Orion: Tell him that he bought me 20 more.
Sam: Tell him that he bought you?
Liam: 40 stakes, four gold. Totally happened. Then I went to the temple of Sarenrae and I got two vials of holy oil. One for my sister, one for me.
Matt: Those are 100 gold apiece.
Liam: Okay. Got it. I can't. Oh, you gave me gold. I'll get four vials of that.
Laura: Yeah, I gave him gold to do it.
Liam: We'll work that out, I promise. I ask if the cleric who helped bring Pike back to life is here.
Matt: Yeah, Tristan is here.
Liam: Jesus, how do you do that?
Matt: Because I have to.
Liam: When I find him I say, you remember my friend Pike? You remember me?
Matt: "Yes, I inspected you. Is that healing well, by the way?" He inspects the wounds on the side of your neck.
Liam: It is. I'm grateful. I need a keepsake of your deity. [no audio]
Matt: And he steps away, goes back, disappears for a minute, comes back and he's holding in a chain around his neck-- It's seen some years of use, but still clean and very well kept, an identical holy symbol of Sarenrae as the one that Pike keeps around her neck. He hands it over and puts it over your head. "May she keep you safe and bring your soul to redemption."
Liam: It reminds me of my friend.
Matt: "As it should." Pats you on the cheek. "As it should."
Liam: All right, so chore number two down. I would like to go to Uriel's temple and ask the guards if anyone has seen my belt, Simon.
Matt: You are stopped at the edge of the Cloudtop District. The guards see you as you approach and block the doorway and say, "We're sorry, but Vox Machina has been given no passage into the Cloudtop District at this time."
Liam: I understand. I don't mean to go in. I understand that we caused a lot of trouble, and I am very sorry, and I don't mean to be any further trouble. There is a belt that I left inside.
Matt: "That's certainly unfortunate, isn't it?"
Liam: Have you seen a snake called Simon? Or any snake?
Matt: Both the guards look at each other and laugh for a second. "Piss off."
Liam: Okay. Chore number four. (laughter)
Liam: I go back. I give everybody their things. I would like to spend the rest of the week, because I am ready, hanging out across the road from the butcher's house that Kynan ran from, and if there are any youths his age who go there to shop, I would like to ask as they leave if they have any idea where he's gone.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Liam: Perception check. Oh, that's a seven. Thought it was a one. (laughs) That is a 17.
Matt: 17. Okay. Keeping an eye out, you do eventually come across a boy that looks about his age. Late teens, maybe early twenties. Comes by and gathers a little bit of meat and rushes off and you stop him.
Liam: Excuse me, I'm sorry to take you away from your day. I'm sorry, what is your name?
Matt: "Jameson."
Liam: Jameson.
Matt: "Yeah, can I help you? I've really got to get home with this."
Liam: I understand, I'll just take a second of your time. I owe a boy who lives here named Kynan, I owe him a few silver and I want to see that he gets it. Is he in town?
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: I'll use the meteorite. That's a 15.
Matt: 15, gives you a look over and goes, "I'm certain you've given him silver, but Kynan's been gone for the better part of a week."
Liam: Where would he have gone?
Matt: "I don't know. He just told us all he was off to find his destiny or some sort of bullshit like that. He's always had his head in the clouds, that one."
Liam: I agree. He ever talked about where he was going, how he meant to go about doing it?
Matt: "No, kept to himself mostly. Sorry, I wish I could be more of a service. If I see him, where should I send him?" (clattering)
Liam: I don't know who that guy is. If you see him, tell him that V. is looking for him at Greyskull Keep.
Matt: "Well, I'll pass that along."
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: "Good day," and he hurries off to continue with his errand.
Liam: Are you all right, old man?
Travis: (old-man voice) I'm fine. It's my knee. (laughter)
Matt: Is that your last errand?
Liam: That's it.
Matt: Scanlan.
Sam: I go to Gilmore's. Are we near Gilmore's?
Matt: Yeah, Gilmore's in the city. He's not in the Cloudtop, so you have access to him still.
Sam: I want to know if such a thing exists, and if so, how much. A potion or a scroll that could invoke either Hallow or Spirit Guardians.
Taliesin: Say what?
Sam: Spirit Guardians is four. Hallow is five.
Matt: Here we go. Okay. Asking around, there are no potions for it, but there is a Scroll of Hallow available, and I will say that comes to roughly 6,000 gold pieces for the Scroll of Hallow.
Marisha: It's how much?
Matt: 6,000 for the Hallow Scroll. And for the Spirit Guardian, you said it was? 4th-level?
Sam: 4th-level.
Matt: That one is 2,000 gold.
Laura: What does that do?
Sam: Spirit Guardians would make some beings around us.
Matt: Spirit Guardians is level three, actually, not level four. That makes it a lot cheaper. That is 600 gold.
Sam: It scares evil things away. It's like a Pike-y thing.
Laura: Do it.
Sam: Can I cast that if I have a scroll?
Matt: If you have a scroll you can, yeah. It has a chance of failing.
Marisha: Yeah, you have to have magic.
Sam: How much did you say?
Matt: 600 gold pieces.
Sam: I'll buy one of those.
Matt: There's only one available. So you mark that down.
Sam: Okay. Yes, I will. I would also like to find a smithy of some sort and make me a little metal choker of chainmail.
Matt: Okay, remembering that you have spoken to Karin before, which is the renowned custom blacksmith in Emon, you speak with her. A chainmail half coif around the neck there is relatively inexpensive. It's a partial piece of armor. She looks at some scrap chainmail on the side and is like: "I'd be more than happy to use that for it. It shouldn't me take more than an hour, two maybe at most."
Laura: Get one for everyone.
Travis: I think they can bite besides the neck, right?
Laura: Yeah, technically, but still!
Sam: (laughs) Sure, I'll get eight of them, or seven of them.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) All right.
Sam: How much are they?
Matt: Seven of those. I'd say for the whole seven it'd put you at 100 gold, because it's custom orders. Seven of those.
Liam: What are they?
Sam: Chainmail chokers
Marisha: Chainmail dickies.
Travis: Oh wait, do you have one more?
Sam: And a small one for my dick. (laughter)
Matt: All righty.
Sam: A tiny one.
Matt: She awkwardly judges and turns that request down. She's uncomfortable with that.
Sam: Then I bow and leave.
Matt: Okay. So you got that. Yes. Just a second there, Tiberius.
Liam: I go to Gilmore's Glorious Goods and ask at the front door if Gilmore is there.
Matt: Gilmore, unfortunately, is in Westruun currently. Still overseeing the construction of his expansion there.
Liam: Understood. Who's the most knowledgeable person next to Gilmore in this store right now?
Matt: That would be... I can't find my updated NPC sheet. Do you remember what her name was?
Marisha: Sherri.
Matt: Sherri, thank you. I was like, Shelby? No. Sherri. Sherri is there greeting you. "That would probably be me."
Liam: Oh, hi. You remember me. I have a very important question. I won't take up much of your time. I pull out a small metal skull cap. Dented in a few places, rusted a bit, from the Underdark. What can you tell me about this?
Matt: She takes it. "If you're requesting identification of a magical item, that is a service we charge."
Liam: Sis, can I borrow some money?
Laura: How much do you need?
Liam: How much would that require?
Matt: "125 gold pieces per enchantment identified."
Liam: Done.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: Talk her down.
Matt: She takes it. She steps inside, sets it on the counter. She starts going through her books and starts looking at it and holding it for a second and doing a full inspection of it. "Based on the enchantment on this device, it's very crude in construction and the enchantment is in an arcane offshoot of language I'm not very familiar with, but it appears it is a guard from some sort of a mental influence. If worn, it would give you a stronger resistance against things that would attempt to peer into your mind."
Liam: Are we talking magic?
Matt: "Yes." So essentially what it would do is it would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws against magic spells.
Liam: Against?
Matt: It would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws against magical effects.
Liam: That's fucking brilliant. I hand her the gold and say, Scanlan sends his regards.
Matt: She noticeably blushes and goes, "Well, send mine back if you wouldn't mind. I've got work to do." And she rushes off.
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: All right. Now, Tiberius.
Sam: 16 errands.
Orion: I only have eight. Just kidding, no. The real quick one is going to the Temple of Sarenrae to pick up a canteen.
Matt: Okay. Did you pay for it already? You paid up front. Okay. So you get the canteen, the explanation is: the enchantment of the actual water creation itself is separate than the holy enchantment that has been attached to it. The holy enchantment is not very powerful because it is an enchanted item. How it functions is the first burst per day that you use of the water does an additional 1d6 radiant damage. That's it. But any additional after that is just water. Basically, whatever water is immediately contained within it at the start of the day is considered blessed. Once that's expelled, all the rest that it creates-- because it's pulling it out of the elemental plane of water; that's how it's continuously projecting it. The rest of it runs straight through, so it doesn't have a chance to even absorb the blessing.
Orion: Gotcha. Okay, cool. Second thing. I drop off my Swallow, or I'll call it the surge blade, and to have that enchanted on both ends.
Matt: With?
Orion: One side fire, the other side water. So however many mages I have to hire for that to happen in ten days, I think we talked about it being eight days or something like that? Or was that only one side?
Matt: (laughs) So what enchantment do you want? Do you want to just do an additional-- What do you want it to be?
Orion: I just want it to be a magical weapon.
Matt: Just a magical weapon? Okay, just a general plus-one magical weapon. Okay. That would take about-- let me double-check the rarity here.
Sam: In the meantime, check out those Critical Role keychains available on Geek and Sundry. (laughter)
Matt: That would run you approximately 700 gold to create it as a plus-one magical item. Would take one mage a week to do it.
Orion: Okay. So I'll do that.
Matt: Okay, so for the week it takes, you pay 700 gold pieces. Your quarterstaff with a couple of daggers tied to the end is now considered a plus-one magical weapon. (laughter)
Orion: I stop at Gilmore's and I drop off my Ring of Protection. And pay whatever that is to add a plus-one to make it instead of a minor, an actual Ring of Protection.
Matt: Unfortunately, the thing is, an enchantment cannot be progressively enhanced. You would have to disenchant and then re-enchant the entire thing.
Orion: I thought Gilmore said they could do that there, before. That's why I was going to cough up the green for the Gil, as it were.
Matt: No. They can enchant the item with it, but it would be the cost of basically re-enchanting the item.
Orion: How much would that be?
Matt: That would cost approximately 25,000 gold pieces.
Sam: Oh jeez.
Matt: And it would take the better part of a year. A plus-two Ring of Protection is a very powerful item.
Sam: It's worth it. It's a good investment.
Matt: That you even acquired one earlier was great luck.
Orion: How about buffing the ring of source spelling--
Matt: The Ring of Spell Storing?
Sam: The thing that I had that I still want. That one.
Matt: The Ring of Spell Storing? That's its enchantment. There is no more powerful version of the Ring of Spell Storing. If you wanted to attempt to do that yourself on your own time, you could. That will cost you upward 60,000 gold pieces and about a year.
Orion: No, not right now.
Laura: How about we stick to the level we're at?
Orion: I didn't know all that stuff was going to be that way. That's why I asked.
Liam: How do you learn if you don't ask?
Matt: It's good to ask these things.
Orion: (laughs) So okay. While the days are going, I want to roll for animal handling to teach Lockheed stuff, which is every morning, whatever.
Matt: I'll say throughout the week, 'cause you've taught Lockheed a lot of things back to back. You can't cram everything in there in the three to four days and like: "You learn everything!" Because you've already taught Lockheed one thing this week. Roll for a second thing you want to teach Lockheed.
Orion: Like, with advantage? I'm just having fun.
Matt: Sure, I'll give you advantage on that.
Orion: That's fine, that's fine. I'll take that. That's 17.
Matt: Roll advantage. Go for it.
Orion: 17.
Travis: For the sake of brevity, can I roll one beard check?
Matt: Yeah. You can roll several beard checks.
Travis: 43.
Matt: 43. It starts filling in.
Travis: 81.
Matt: Nope.
Travis: 86.
Liam: Aw, come on Grog.
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16.
Travis: 68, 19. 58.
Matt: Okay. So by the time the week comes to an end, the other side of your beard has finally filled in and you are back to a full beard, Grog.
Laura: Good job, Grog.
Matt: So yeah, that succeeds. It takes you a few days to get it though, but what do you want to teach Lockheed?
Orion: I want to teach him to be quiet.
Matt: A very important thing to teach a creature. So Lockheed has learned to be quiet. Good. Anything else?
Orion: Yes. I got that, that. Throughout the days, I'm going to go all the shops and see how many glass mirrors-- I'm looking for mirrors, just all kinds of mirrors, every size.
Matt: There are plenty of mirrors out there. There are general stores that sell them all over.
Orion: I'm looking for five-by-five to ten-by-ten size mirrors.
Sam: Feet?!
Orion: Yeah. No, inches.
Matt: Okay. I misunderstood. Yeah. You could've had them custom made if they weren't out there, but they have mirrors of that size available.
Orion: I need about 1,500 of them. Can I get 1,500? How many can I get?
Matt: There aren't that many mirrors in the city.
Orion: Okay. All of them.
Sam: You know, if you hold two next to each other there looks like there's a million of them.
Orion: You know what, that's true.
Matt: They're five gold apiece, and of what is currently available for purchase, you may be able to acquire about 35 mirrors, and you'll clean out most of the places that will stop selling them to you.
Liam: That's cutting-edge technology in this day and age.
Orion: How many, if I laid them out on a flat surface, how many-- (laughs) How many feet would that cover?
Liam: Well, two per foot, Tibs. They're five inches apiece, right? You can fit two in a foot. So you just bought 35, so that's about--
Laura: 17 feet! 17 whole feet of mirrors!
Sam: If you're doing a square, it's three feet by three feet.
Matt: Yeah, four by four. So there you go. Four by four.
Orion: I'll take all that. How much is that?
Matt: Okay. 35 times five. So we're looking at 175 gold.
Orion: Done. And then, for timeline stuff, I'm going to do as much as I can to start enchanting my bolts, and I'm going to go work with Keyleth on stuff.
Matt: Keyleth's been working with Percy this whole time.
Marisha: The whole time?
Matt: It's taken the entire week for him, you said you were assisting him.
Marisha: No, you said I couldn't assist him. I had no intelligence to assist him.
Matt: I thought you said you were still going to help cheer him on. Okay, then no worries. Then yeah, you're available.
Orion: I'm going to try to make as many sleep bolts as I can. But the other thing with Keyleth is I would like to enchant a bolt that is a smoke screen, but it consists of holy water. So I use a pour of the day from the canteen and use that as a mist instead of a smoke.
Matt: The enchantment of an arrow to do that is the use of a Fog spell. There is no way to infuse a Fog spell with holy water.
Marisha: That's what I was saying. I don't know if you can do holy water. I can do a Fog spell.
Orion: Can we infuse a Fog spell with a Sleep spell?
Matt: No.
Orion: Can we try super hard?
Matt: Sure. Make a roll.
Orion: God damn it. Okay.
Marisha: Like, the best I could possibly do is maybe take one of these holy water things.
Orion: What am I rolling?
Matt: Plus arcana.
Travis: Do you think it matters? No.
Orion: 24.
Matt: 24. Okay. After spending approximately 500 gold in materials, the enchantment fails, both spells fizzled. You lost 500 gold. But now you know. Probably can't combine two spells into a single enchantment.
Liam: And knowing is half the battle.
Orion: Don't worry, it came out of my pocket.
Sam: I've got fog.
Orion: Okay.
Travis: How about you get nothing else, and we move on?
Orion: Last thing.
Travis: No last thing.
Orion: I stop at Allura's.
Matt: You go towards the Cloudtop District, and the guards stop you again.
Orion: I remember that as I walk up, and I go back to Greyskull Keep.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Oh wait, I don't do that.
Orion: Oh wait, I don't do that.
Marisha: #OrionAcaba.
Orion: I realize what I'm doing, and I stop.
Liam: Also. This will just take ten seconds, at some point in the week, when Keyleth is taking a walk, I go into her garden, and I clip one flower, and I take it.
Matt: How many sleep bolts?
Liam: Go sleep in your money.
Orion: You said I could do that.
Taliesin: You're busy this week.
Sam: Can he get back to the keep and we've all left four days ago? (laughter)
Orion: Carrying groceries in, look, guys  hoagie stuff!
Sam: Dear Tiberius. We left.
Laura: We got really bored and we left.
Matt: Okay, I will say for each arrow, it will cost you 600 gold and will take you six days to do, per arrow.
Laura: Six days per arrow?
Matt: Yes. It's one day per 100 gold of an enchantment. Which is even me making it higher than the book says. It should take you four times that.
Orion: Cool. Can it cost more if I hire a mage?
Laura: (screams)
Matt: You want to hire a mage?
Marisha: I need to do shit, too. I can't be everyone's bitch.
Matt: So three and a half days and it cost you 1,200 gold for a single sleep bolt.
Orion: Sweet. And I do two of those. And I'm broke.
Liam: He's spent people, he's spent.
Matt: Okay, so you've done all of your shopping in one day and spent the rest of the week doing those. All right, so there we go. You're broke and you have two sleep bolts on your person. Keyleth.
Marisha: I got to Gilmore's and I buy an alchemy set.
Matt: Okay. That comes to--
Sam: 95,000 gold
Orion: It's going to be a lot more than you think, apparently.
Matt: Alchemist supplies? 50 gold.
Orion: Oh, come on!
Matt: Not enchanted, yo. "It's magic, give me all the magic!"
Taliesin: This is made of things.
Marisha: This is made of things. And then I go home and I make a few Cure Wounds potions. Try it out, since I've learned and I've been studying and I've been doing my research. So maybe a few level two, level three Cure Wounds potions?
Matt: A level two healing potion, a greater healing potion. The materials involved in creating that will come to, I'd say about 400 apiece, and you'd have time to create two. It's about four days per potion.
Sam: (whispered) How much do they cost?
Matt: To purchase? They cost about 500 to 600. She's getting a discount because she's making it herself.
Marisha: Wait, they cost 500 to 600 and they cost 400 for me to make them?
Matt: Yes. It's your first time doing it. They'll probably get cheaper over time as you get better at it.
Marisha: Oh, okay. Cheaper over time as I get better at it? That's funsies. Well, let me make-- What is that? A greater healing potion?
Matt: It's a greater healing. So for each one you make, roll a d20 and add five.
Marisha: Let me make one for right now.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: That's an 18. That's pretty good.
Matt: Then yeah, you successfully create the potion. No issue.
Marisha: Awesome. I had a Percy-roll! And he hates me for it. How long will it take me to make a Daylight scroll?
Matt: A Daylight scroll? What level spell is that?
Marisha: Third.
Matt: Third? That'll cost you about, I'd say, 600 gold pieces. It'll take you six days. You don't have time. You could pay more to have somebody else help you make one if you wanted to.
Marisha: Then I make two greater healing potions. Actually, no, I want to experiment. I want to take one of those holy water bottles. And I want to see if I can enchant it with my Fog spell. To make it a holy water fog grenade. When you throw it, it'll go (shatters) with my fog spell.
Matt: You know that upon throwing the holy water, it would shatter. It would create a fog, but the holy water itself would just affect the creature you threw it at. You'd be able to blend the two enchantments; they don't necessarily mix. The fog itself is not created from the water, it's created from the glass that you're enchanting.
Laura: Plus, we didn't get any holy water, we only got holy oil to put on our weapons.
Matt: You have a couple of flasks of holy water.
Marisha: What if I enchant it with Daylight? Oh wait, it still won't--
Matt: It's a whole different thing. Daylight, that's more of a scroll thing.
Marisha: I'm going to do it, anyway. I'm going to do the fog thing, because I said it. I'm going to commit.
Matt: Okay. That will cost you-- I'll put it at 500 gold pieces. And that'll take you five days.
Orion: For a fog scroll?
Marisha: No, for the fog holy water thing. It's a holy smoke grenade.
Liam: Someday, we will get out of the character creation menu, but not this day.
Taliesin: I don't like the nose yet. It's too low.
Marisha: Sure. That'll be my two things I do.
Matt: Okay, roll another d20. Plus five.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Matt: All right. You feel the fog enchantment take shape in the glass vial. It seems relatively unstable. You gather that this glass was not meant to contain an enchantment from the get-go. You somehow manage to make it function, but you have to be very careful with that vial.
Orion: Here, put it in here.
Matt: Who knows what'll happen if it actually is thrown?
Laura: Don't put it in a Bag of Holding.
Liam: Give it to Scanlan.
Marisha: Who would like a very unstable item?
Laura: Percy's used to unstable things.
Marisha: I give it to Scanlan.
Taliesin: Was that a jab at my-- No, never mind.
Matt: It's a fog-enchanted vial of holy water. You can write it down that way if you'd like.
Sam: I'll just put it on my back. I'll just hang it.
Marisha: Please be careful. Wait, I tell him. Scanlan, this is very delicate. Please be very gentle with this.
Sam: I will put it where I put all gentle things.
Marisha: That I trust. I trust that more. Fine. Good.
Orion: You do not make the wisest decisions here your Majesty, I must say.
Matt: What was once holy-- (laughter)
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Sam: I give everyone the chainmail.
Matt: Okay. You give all the chainmail.
Laura: Oh. Look at this, so fancy.
Sam: I take that fancy box I bought a couple times ago, and I take the blue crystal that we found in our very first adventure and I put it in and I seal it tight. Shit. I had one more thing I wanted to do. Oh yes, I drink my Shit-Scrying Potion, shit in a jar and leave it in the kitchen. And tell the help, don't touch it.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) It takes much convincing, but nevertheless they acquiesce to your request, being the boss. All right. Anything else?
Taliesin: Yeah. Just going to let the guards know to watch our guest while we're away. Keep him under protection.
Travis: Are we leaving him here?
Taliesin: I think so.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: The what?
Orion: The guy who built stuff, regardless, did I do that or is that just in my head?
Matt: Lord Daxio, you mean? What about him?
Orion: So I didn't do that yet.
Travis: Yeah, you going to do something on his room, Keyleth?
Laura: I go find Jarett, and I give him 200 gold. And I say, do not let-- Desmond? Leave your side. Watch him, watch for invisible anything. Protect him with everything you can.
Matt: "I will do this with my life. Do not worry."
Sam: Have we given them a raise?
Laura: I just gave him 200 fucking gold.
Travis: Double the guard on him.
Laura: And yeah, everybody-- fuck. I give a hundred--
Sam: Five of them make 100 a month, two of them make 50 a month.
Laura: I give another 200 to him and tell him to pass it out to the rest of the guard. We'll be back soon!
Matt: "Very generous, and I think they'll be very happy to find this. Thank you very much."
Laura: And add another guard to the watch.
Travis: Two to Desmond. At all times.
Matt: "Very well. I will do this. Thank you."
Laura: Thank you.
Orion: I going to tell Erwen to go and ask for court for the lord that can construct and tell him that we would like to make some changes and have the cells converted into barracks for our soldiers.
Sam: That won't do anything.
Orion: That's what I do. That's what Tiberius does.
Matt: Okay. Erwen goes, "All right, sir." And he wanders off.
Orion: Getting a good reputation does not mean holding prison cells.
Matt: About an hour later Erwen returns and says, "I'm sorry. They would not allow me into the central district. I do not have the proper papers to pass within. I mentioned that I worked for you, and they told me I was not to enter."
Orion: Oh, maybe you should have said a different name.
Sam: They would have known when they got to our keep.
Orion: That's true. (laughs)
Laura: Shall we head out?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Did I learn anything from Seeker Asum?
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d20, adding your wisdom modifier.
Laura: Ah jeez, really?
Liam: Come on, Laura.
Laura: What if I roll like shit?
Liam: Then it'll be hilarious. Roll that die. Come on. Roll high and it will be amazing.
Matt: Make it with advantage, because Asum is a very good teacher.
Laura: He is. He's so good.
Sam: He's awesome.
Laura: (fake crying) No, that was terrible.
Marisha: Advantage!
Liam: You are playing DND right now! All right.
Laura: Plus my wisdom. 17.
Matt: 17, okay.
Liam: Is she an emperor now?
Matt: (laughs) Is that how this works? All right, so talking with Asum. He works with you for a bit and teaches you the ranger ability Skirmisher's Stealth.
Sam: Skirmisher's Stealth?
Matt: So if you start one of your turns hidden from a creature, you can then, as a bonus action at the end of your turn, make another stealth check to remain hidden from them. You essentially can dive between areas and still be hidden.
Laura: While I'm attacking?
Liam: That's all ranger stuff?
Laura: Cool.
Liam: (air horn noises)
Sam: (air horn noises)
Matt: So yeah. We'll go over the details of it after the game. Essentially, you learn a new ranger ability from Seeker Asum.
Marisha: Dope.
Liam: Wow. I bought some sticks.
Matt: All right.
Orion: At the end of the first day, before all of that stuff happens. Sorry, guys, this is necessary.
Travis: Is it?
Liam: Everybody shut up and let Grog go on a one man, solo kill spree.
Travis: It's bound to happen. He's going to secede.
Matt: Tiberius, what do you want to do?
Orion: I'm in my lab the first night and I write a Scroll of Telescription to my father. And I go, dear father, and I tell him about the circumstances with the vampires.
Laura: Dear diary. Sorry.
Orion: At the end of it I go  I invoke the ambassador's right of war time as of now, and moreover as your son when I provide concrete evidence, you will know. But in the meantime, I would have you gather 50 ground troops of the Draconian knights and 50 winged soldiers of the wyvern fleet. Have them at the ready for my signal. I know it will take you a few days of travel to get here, but this is a town of vampires and possibly liches, which you know need to be destroyed no matter what. Your son, with love, Tiberius.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Everyone is aware that Tiberius is the giant eagles in Lord of the Rings. Tiberius can invoke ultimate destruction at the call of whatever he wants.
Orion: I don't know what's going on over there.
Matt: All right. As the week comes to a close, eventually a note appears before you, Tiberius, within your magical room. (fluttering) It reads: "Tiberius, child. I understand your request. However, you are fresh to these political matters and as the young one prone to jump at the sight of a shadow, I would need some very heavy proof to invoke wartime. Which, if I might add, is not your jurisdiction, but my own. Should you wish to bring this to my attention, you are welcome to, but you have but one chance before I set aside this intrusion to my work time as mere poppycock." (laughter)
Matt: "Tiberius, I trust that in time you will prove yourself to this family and to this country, but for the time being, business matters of this larger scale are best left to those with experience. With love, Kruvanis Stormwind."
Liam: (whispers) Send him three more letters.
Orion: Damn it. Have to provide proof to my fucking father. Fine. He didn't say no, which is what he always says. Which is a lot better than what he always says.
Sam: I walk into Tiberius' room while he's having this conversation with himself. And I say, what are you doing in here?
Orion: I'm talking to myself, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, okay. All right. I'm going to go get some garlic from the kitchen, and then let's go!
Laura: I write a note. Address it to Uriel, hand it to our main butler. Who I know his name.
Matt: Erwen.
Laura: Erwen. It basically says  Uriel, FYI, we didn't totally flee. We's looking for evidence. No, we didn't flee. We'll be back, how about that? We'll be back.
Matt: All right. The note is left with Erwen.
Laura: And I tell him, only give this to anybody if they come looking for us and they're angry.
Matt: "Yes, of course. Of course."
Marisha: Grog? Do you think I should do the whole elemental guardian thing?
Travis: Why not?
Marisha: All right.
Orion: How are you doing, Grog?
Travis: I'm fucking bored. (laughter)
Travis: I've been sitting here for 30 fucking minutes. I'm bored! Cast an elemental and make it smash everything around the keep.
Marisha: Give me that ruby. (ting) I catch it. Water elemental seems appropriate based on our knowledge, yeah? Water elemental. And Planar Binding. And I talk to him in my elemental speech, which I can do.
Taliesin: And you say? (gargles water during Marisha's speech)
Marisha: And I say, look, we're going to be gone for 30 days. We have a visitor here. Make sure nothing or no one brings him any harm. (laughter)
Matt: I don't have a drink.
Orion: That make you thirsty?
Taliesin: You know, you can speak English, you don't have to--
Matt: Yeah. The elemental gives you an acknowledgment and speaks back in its own tongue the equivalent of, for my time here, I serve.
Marisha: Wait, what? I'm sorry.
Matt: "For my time here, I serve" is essentially the essence of what you get from him
Marisha: For my time here, I serve?
Matt: For my time here, I serve. All right.
Sam: Onward.
Liam: I love doing this show. (laughter)
Sam: Do we know where we're going?
Taliesin: Yeah, I know where we're going.
Liam: Percival de Rolo knows where we're going to go.
Taliesin: We head to Turst Fields.
Marisha: Are we riding there by horseback? Is that what we're doing?
Sam: Do we know where we're going?
Matt: Well, Percy said the Turst Fields. The Turst Fields you do know. Some of you may have passed by them. They are to the east, northeast area of Westruun, on the eastern side of the continent. It's about four and a half days' travel horseback.
Travis: What if we purchased a carriage?
Orion: What if we went on airship instead? We have one at our disposal, do we not?
Marisha: Well, we had one at our disposal when we were friends of the city.
Laura: I think it's in the Cloudtop District, actually.
Liam: I think we need to go on the down-low.
Marisha: Yeah, let's not tell anybody that we're leaving.
Sam: Carriage. Let's go. How much do they cost?
Marisha: Do we need a carriage? We have a stable full of horses.
Liam: Rein it in. We're going to fight vampires.
Matt: You have four horses, and you technically have the teleportation sigil for Westruun.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Orion: Is Briarwood keep over there?
Matt: Westruun's most of the way across the continent. It's about a day's ride out from Westruun.
Marisha: So that would shave time?
Matt: It would shave about three days off your journey.
Liam: Matt, I'm pretty sure it's "si-google."
Taliesin: Turst Fields is just northeast of Westruun.
Laura: Let's do it!
Liam: What's in those fields?
Matt: The Turst Fields are a farming community that takes care of a lot of the eastern side. They're not really an extension of Westruun, but it's one of the closest cities. And they do a lot of food trade up into Whitestone, or did previously.
Taliesin: It's where we would make our camp.
Marisha: Let's head there and make camp. And maybe talk about a plan.
Liam: Yes. I think, Percival, you're leading the way. Use my sister as an advisor, but you're leading the way right now.
Taliesin: I'm going to draw out a crude map while we make our way so I can let you all know where we're going.
Orion: Well, then join me in my laboratory, everyone.
Sam: All right, yes. We go to Tiberius's laboratory.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius, you go ahead and cast Teleportation Circle.
Orion: Not yet. I go, hey, look at the laboratory, guys. What do you think? Scanlan, it looks like you're impressed.
Sam: (dryly) Oh, I'm very impressed.
Matt: Now you cast Circle of Teleportation.
Orion: I use my sigil there. I got it set up there.
Matt: Yep, and the circle appears. You guys rush through it. You do not have your horses with you because they would not be able to travel through the teleportation circle with you. However, you could probably procure some while you're in Westruun. In doing that, you guys, for the case of brevity on this-- we've been missing that for a lot of this session.
Liam: Let's do this in real time.
Matt: We'll say the total gold to purchase horses for the whole party--
Laura: After I haggled. Because let's be honest, I would've.
Matt: You would've. Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.
Travis: You would've.
Orion: Even in real time.
Marisha: Do it.
Laura: 21.
Matt: 21? Okay, yeah, would put you at about, we'll say because you are renowned in this area and you've helped Westruun. Helped them during the Winter's Crest Festival the year before, using that discount. You manage to procure everyone's horses, including your warhorse, for 210 gold, which is a pretty decent discount.
Laura: Yes it is. All right.
Taliesin: Can I share my map?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Laura: (gasps) You made a map?
Sam: You drew that just now?
Taliesin: You know I've forged all of our documents? You are aware of that, right? Any time we've needed papers.
Laura: Wait, where is Westruun? Oh, there's Westruun, that's where we are right now. So we have to go-- I just spit on your map, Percy. Up through the woods, into the mountains. Whitestone is mountains.
Liam: You can handle that.
Laura: Yeah, I can handle both.
Travis: We're here, and we've got to go here.
Laura: Right.
Sam: Let's set out.
Matt: You have two paths. You have the path into the center of the Parchwood Woods that leads up into the valley of the Alabaster Sierras that surround it. That is the direct route to Whitestone that leads through the main pathway. The forest to the front of the city. There's also the Alabaster Sierras themselves, which surround that peninsula that extends into the northern part of the continent. They are very tall, fjord-like, craggy mountain ranges up against the sea along the edge. They're a little more treacherous, but a little more out of the way; a backdoor route. So you guys choose which route you want to take.
Taliesin: I would prefer not the direct route.
Orion: Always go in the backdoor.
Taliesin: Can you say that anything that is not laced with sexual innuendo?
Laura: Mountain ranges are part of my favored terrain. We don't get disadvantage traveling through.
Taliesin: I would prefer taking that direction. I don't want to head straight towards them.
Laura: There probably will be mountain giants, though, remember, that throw boulders and they will be terrible.
Taliesin: The Parchwood Forests are dangerous as they are. There's really no safe way.
Sam: I trust Percy; whatever you say.
Matt: Percy, you are aware that here have been problems in the past with various mountain-faring giants that lived north of Whitestone that occasionally would wander too far south. They mostly kept to themselves, but occasionally they had some crossover, there were some scuffles here and there. So you guys are deciding to take the Alabaster Sierras?
Laura: Yes. I want to cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone.
Matt: You guys head out from Westruun; it takes about a day's worth of travel. You stop in the Turst Fields. It's a small farming community. You ask around for a bit, most of the folks there say that they haven't had much trade or communication with Whitestone like they used to. They do still provide crops and such, but they don't allow anyone past into the actual forest. They trade at the boundary created by the forest. Still pay gold, but it seems to be more enclosed scenario, but very few folks there seem to question it. Business as usual is still left within Turst Fields. Make your way northward to the bottom of the Alabaster Sierras, and as you begin heading up the outskirts of this mountain range, you do notice that the mountains are extremely high in altitude. There's a perpetual climb at nearly a 40-degree angle as you continue upward further and further and further. The drop-off at the edge of the cliff is 1,000 to 2,000 feet at times, straight down into the ocean or rocks below. There are paths worn up here; it has been used as travel before. Although you're uncertain as to how recently it may have been traversed. Occasionally, the wind picks up and you have to steel yourself, push yourself against the side. The path, thankfully, is maybe 15, 20, sometimes 30 feet in width. It's not too much where you're being forced against the edge, but it's enough to be aware of the danger of the circumstance. You guys are heading up, I'd say, about half a day's travel, it's about 2:00 in the afternoon. Also, you can tell there are slight outcroppings a few hundred feet down to the bottom, a few bits of stone that jut out from the side. You can see small nests or bushes that have taken root on those side areas. The rock itself of this mountain range is unusually, unnaturally white. The actual rock that forms this entire region is almost a glowing quartz-like texture. There are parts that are almost translucent, there are parts that are very milky white. Number one, you can now understand as to partially why the area is called Whitestone, the town nearby, and you've heard mention from Percy in the past of the large quarries here that mine the stone for various uses and export it throughout all of Tal'Dorei. That's where a large portion of the town was built around that trade at the beginning of its construction. Eventually, you come to a point where there is a falloff on the path, where the erosion or some sort of large impact of the side caused the path to fall into a scooped crevasse that is a smooth fall down the side. There is no way across other than a large sea salt air-rotted rope bridge that goes across about a hundred feet. You see it rocking (creaking) with the wind.
Travis: I don't think this looks very stable.
Laura: Man, you know what I would give for a flying fucking carpet right now?
Sam: So the bridge is out?
Matt: No, the bridge can be crossed. It looks a little rickety. It's not terrible or frightening, but it's been there for a while, and you can tell from the color of the rope--
Sam: How far is it across?
Matt: A hundred feet.
Orion: Should I go first, everyone?
Taliesin: I want to inspect it from an engineering perspective, if that's possible.
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Okay. Looking at it, I mean, the anchors are pretty solid in the stonework. There's no looseness to their element. The rope itself is taut and seems to have serviced long enough. There are no signs of extreme wear other than just time and weather.
Liam: I'm going to walk forward.
Laura: I'm going to tie the fucking rope around your waist before you do that.
Taliesin: That's quite a good idea!
Liam: Sarenrae, jeepers. I'm going to use perception, I'm going to look at it before going out. That is a 23.
Matt: All right. Are you taking your horse with you?
Liam: I leave my horse with my sister. I'm on foot; I'm on all fours, really. Spidering out.
Matt: Making your way across, you get halfway across the bridge. There's a creaking sound and slight movement as the wind picks up at times and you (creaking).
Liam: So I'm lasting. What would I make, is it an insight check to decide if I thought Grog could make it across this thing?
Matt: Make an intelligence check. Roll and add your intelligence modifier.
Taliesin: It's a ten.
Liam: Take that zero off it, and you've got it.
Matt: Best you can tell, Grog looks like a big guy.
Liam: This is fun. You swing back and forth. Grog, I think you might like this!
Marisha: How far across is the bridge? A hundred feet?
Taliesin: Once you're across, let's secure the rope that's attached to you, and we'll make ourselves a guideline that we can hang onto.
Laura: I like it.
Liam: All right, he sounds like a Debbie Downer, Grog, but I'll go across, and you can follow.
Matt: Okay, you make the rest of your way across. No issue. The rope bridge carries your weight all the way.
Laura: Tie a rope. I tie the other side.
Liam: Is there anything on the other side I could tie it to?
Matt: There's a couple of small cliffside trees that grow off in strange twisting bonsai tree-like branches that stick off. They're pretty sturdy.
Liam: I use a sailor knot.
Laura: I use a special ranger knot that's really extra strong.
Matt: Secret ranger knot. Well played. (laughter)
Matt: Who's up next?
Liam: I double-knot mine.
Sam: We've got to get the horses across.
Travis: No, they ain't coming.
Sam: They're not coming? Oh. Well, I just Dimension Door across, then.
Liam: Jeepers! Will you warn a half-elf when you're going to do that?
Matt: Spooks you for a second. You hold on and you make your way across. You guys are now on the other side. You're holding onto everyone's horses left behind.
Laura: Trinket.
Travis: I tie up all the horses to a very large tree.
Marisha: Are we going by foot now?
Laura: Looks like it. Tiberius, are you still on our side? Are you with me, still? Will you cast Fly on Trinket? I love you.
Orion: Sure. To make it across?
Laura: I can climb on him and you cast Fly and you only have to use one little spell.
Orion: If I cast it on him, I would probably jump on myself, because I'm a little bit heavier than you are, darling.
Laura: Then do it!
Liam: She's haggling you right now.
Orion: You can have him afterwards.
Laura: Yeah, you can go, and I'll just use the little rope.
Orion: Fine. Proceed.
Matt: You cast Fly on Trinket--
Orion: No, I don't. I don't do shit yet. I wait for you guys to get across, so if something happens, then I can cast it.
Laura: Okay, just protect him.
Matt: So you get on Trinket's back?
Laura: No, he hasn't cast it on him yet.
Matt: So who's going across now?
Laura: I am!
Matt: Okay, you make it across. No problem. You're light enough and able to guide the movement of the bridge.
Laura: Good thing I only had one frittata the other day!
Marisha: Here's my question. What looks shaky, the connection of the bridge or the actual, physical condition of the bridge itself?
Matt: The physical condition of the bridge. There is no actual visible point that is--
Marisha: For bonus added safety in case this bridge gives way, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine and have it loop and wrap around the edge of the bridge. Further enforce it.
Matt: The vines reach around and wrap around the edges of the wood slats and the rope handholds, and it seems to be pretty well-held on that side.
Taliesin: Clever!
Marisha: At least that side will be fine. And then I'll go across.
Matt: Cool, you make it across without a problem.
Travis: Who else needs to go across?
Laura: Just you and Tiberius and Trinket.
Travis: You want me to go first?
Orion: It's fine! I hop on Trinket and I pet Lockheed. And then I hop on Trinket and I cast Fly on him and say, Remember how to go across. And then as we start flying across, I cast Telekinesis on Grog and take him with me. Kind of like Green Lantern.
Marisha: Concentration spells.
Orion: Yeah. That should be 12 seconds to get across a bridge, right?
Matt: Yeah, that would be 12 seconds, which will be enough time. So as you're coasting over with Trinket, floating (bear sounds) you turn around and cast Telekinesis. Grog, all of a sudden, you're lifted up and held aloft. You look down over yourself, waving your hands instinctually. Looking down, you can see a 600, 700 foot drop before the rock comes to a point which would probably splinter or crush anyone who fell into it, and then is pushed out to the ocean. So it's a little scary, but you start flailing about as you're being pulled across by Tiberius. Eventually, Trinket comes, lands on the other side safely. You guide Grog over, down onto his feet. Safe and sound.
Marisha: Who's left?
Sam: No one. The horses.
Laura: Oh yeah, what do you want to do with the horses?
Travis: We tied them up.
Orion: I'm going to dispel the Fly. But I'm going to hold the Telekinesis for the ten minutes I can on Grog. I'm not going to do anything, I'm just going to keep that spell going.
Matt: Okay. Cool. All righty.
Sam: I say a prayer of thanks to the horses, who will surely die of starvation.
Laura: They were tied up in a super grassy area with a shit-ton of water around.
Liam: They'll be eaten by something long before that. It's fine.
Marisha: So what's our plan? What are we doing?
Sam: The plan is walk until we get there.
Matt: The path pinches a little bit tighter as you go across, about a ten foot width and you guys begin pulling across. There's a sudden large gust of sea air blows in as you guys go ahead and buckle down to hold on. I'd like you all to roll an athletics check.
Laura: Are we in mountains yet? So I have advantage?
Matt: You have advantage on it.
Travis: Me too, because mountains are my favorite--
Matt: That's true, yeah!
Laura: What is this, acrobatics?
Sam: Athletics.
Laura: Athletics.
Sam: Nine. ORION. 18.
Marisha: 19.
Taliesin: Ten.
Laura: 11.
Travis: 23.
Matt: All right, as you guys are holding tight, both Scanlan and Vax are trying to grab something, holding onto rocks, but before they can get enough, they're both so small, it pushes them out.
Orion: How much time has passed?
Matt: It's three seconds. Oh! Passed since the bridge? About five, six minutes.
Orion: Can I try to catch them because I still have the Telekinesis going?
Matt: You can catch one of them.
Orion: (yelling) Why, Matthew?!
Matt: Because the spell has to be directed!
Marisha: Are they flying off a cliff?
Matt: They're both being dragged by the wind off the side of the cliff. You can see them grabbing the ground. Vax is being pulled off the side as Scanlan is actually lifted off his feet.
Orion: I know Vax can't. I grab Vax!
Liam: Tell my sister I love her!
Travis: I jump and try and grab Vex.
Laura: Vax. You want to hold me?
Liam: I'm Vox.
Orion: Wait, you're grabbing him?
Laura: I'm Vex.
Travis: That's what I said!
Matt: You grab Vax and hold him in place as you reach out and grab Vax by the arms and pull him back onto--
Liam: Wait, who?
Orion: You!
Liam: Oh, he grabs me!
Travis: I grab her.
Laura: Grog grabbed me.
Matt: You were fine.
Laura: I know. But he still said he'd grabbed me.
Matt: Okay. Then you're being held aloft by Tiberius' Telekinesis concentrating. Scanlan has fallen out of view.
Marisha: I Grasping Vine him before he goes out of view.
Matt: Okay. It's all right.
Marisha: Off the side of the cliff.
Matt: Go ahead and make an attack roll with your Grasping Vine.
Orion: I can manipulate a thousand pounds.
Liam: You've got me.
Marisha: What?!
Matt: This is to aim the vine as he falls.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19? Not a problem! The vine grabs Scanlan and pulls him back and holds him as the wind slowly dies down.
Orion: I guide Vax back to the cliff.
Matt: The wind dies down. You guys now begin pushing yourselves close to the edge of this pathway up the side of this seaside cliff. It doesn't seem to deviate much beyond that 15-foot width now, which puts you all at general unease. As the sun's getting closer and closer to setting, you're making your way around the crest. You've been traveling this mountain range for a good number of hours now. You're at a decent height, you're on foot, a good distance inside the Alabaster Sierra mountain range. Perception check, everyone.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Travis: Five.
Sam: Four.
Matt: Three, two, one.
Marisha: 25.
Taliesin: 26.
Liam: 29.
Laura: 25.
Orion: I rolled a natural one, with negative two.
Matt: Okay! Those of you with a higher perception than 20 on this roll. As you pull along, you hear this echoing sound, this (bird-like sounds) in the distance, the wind's carrying it as it's blowing past you.
Marisha: Does it sounds like anything nature-based? Something I could possibly have talked to in the past?
Taliesin: Is it something I would know?
Matt: Go ahead and make an intelligence check. You go ahead and make a nature check.
Taliesin: 21.
Marisha: 25.
Matt: It is birdish in nature, but it sounds too guttural and too articulate to be a bird. There is enough of-- you notice there's a language of the chittering that is bird-like, but there is actual voice. You recall that there are various creatures that make the cliffsides home. One of the ones that are more obnoxious that some of the earlier traders of Whitestone had problems with making this path for mining were clusters of harpies.
Marisha: Oh, fucking harpies.
Taliesin: Harpies.
Orion: Harpies.
Orion: They're the opposite of the Harpers, which are good.
Travis: What's a harpy?
Orion: A harpy's a jerk, a stupid butthole who's super loud.
Matt: You glance over as you guys are having this conversation. Behind you, you can see in the distance from where you were, a couple of these dark shapes swooping down. You see a cluster of about four or five of these harpies diving.
Taliesin: Can we find a place to maybe settle down?
Laura: Can we stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on us!
Sam: Don't worry! I can make us all look like cows again!
Marisha: (shushes) Everyone be quiet! MATT How long is the concentration on Pass Without a Trace? How long can you hold that concentration?
Laura: Up to one hour.
Matt: Okay. It has faded since then.
Marisha: Where are we against the mountain? Are we still on the mountain edge?
Matt: Yeah, you're still on the path, and you look back from where you came from.
Marisha: So we have a mountain behind our backs?
Matt: Yeah, a sheer cliff.
Marisha: I turn around and I cast Move Earth, my 6th-level fucker. And I (boof) and I clear out a cave.
Matt: Okay. As you're concentrating on this, eventually, Keyleth begins to focus, and over the next minute or so, she begins to push a cavern.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us now.
Matt: Okay. As this is happening, you can see the harpies have definitely found some sort of prey. They're distracted as they're slowly tearing apart what you gather are the horses you left behind.
Laura: Oh no! Terrible!
Matt: Yeah. Good news is, they're distracted.
Marisha: Horses saved our lives, guys.
Matt: Bad news is they're probably not going to be there when you come back.
Taliesin: It's getting dark. I think we should camp.
Liam: So you're saying there's a chance.
Matt: Over the next few minutes or so, Keyleth, you've pushed a good ten by 15-foot cavern into the side of this wall that didn't previously exist. You guys are able to step out of the light as the sun's starting to disappear over the mountain range, the Cliffkeep, which you can see in the distance across this channel now. There's a channel of water between the two.
Marisha: I go ahead and Druidcraft a little campfire. Tiberius, you want to light a fire for us?
Laura: I'm going to use Hide in Plain Sight. I'm going to see if I can do this. That sort of ability to camouflage the opening of the cave to where they wouldn't be able to see it.
Matt: Sure! Go ahead and make a stealth check.
Laura: 28.
Matt: Okay! You take the next 15 minutes or so, finding what nearby pieces of brush you can and rocks that have been loosely around the area and you start setting up this pattern of them that closes off some of the entrance from the smooth opening that Keyleth had created. It takes a little ingenuity because it's just a rock opening, and there isn't a whole lot of brush and things around. But you feel you've managed to mask it to the point that to a distant eye it would be hard to see that there is an actual cavern there. At this point, the sun has set, night has come in, and you guys are sitting within this cavern hearing the distant sound of the ocean waves crashing against the bottom of these cliffside, coastal fjords.
Marisha: Me and Tiberius made a fire.
Matt: All right, a fire is made.
Orion: I lit it with my spitting.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius forms a relatively useful and effective campfire within this cave.
Laura: Oh! I want to use my holy oil and dip a couple arrows in the holy oil because I know I can make three based on what we've done before.
Matt: You can, yes. Do be aware, the holy oil will only last about a day.
Laura: Oh, really? Oh, so I'll do that right before.
Matt: It's one of those things where if you dip it now and leave it, over time it'll just either evaporate or drip off of the arrow.
Laura: Good to know.
Liam: While my sister's looking at her shit, I bogart Trinket and climb up onto him, use him like a sleeping bag and cuddle into his softest warm parts and fall asleep.
Matt: (bear groaning) Trinket, at first, just haplessly pushes you away, but recognizes your scent and lets you.
Laura: You ganked my sleeping bag.
Liam: Sorry, not sorry.
Orion: I find a little patch of dust and do a little dust bath real quick and then I'm going to use one of my books of stuffs and start researching liches just because I want to.
Matt: Okay. I mean, what book would you be researching this in?
Orion: Tobin's Spirit Guide?
Matt: The researcher ability is that you can go to places of research and find books. You don't really keep a tome of all knowledge with you. The next time you find a town or you're in town, then you can use that ability to research in advance.
Laura: I ask Grog how he's doing.
Travis: I'm bored as shit.
Laura: You want to arm wrestle?
Travis: No.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Come on, do it, Grog! Come on, you can't beat a girl?
Matt: Do you guys all rest for the evening?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: But we should take watch.
Taliesin: I'm still awake. I'm going to fall asleep last.
Marisha: I also stay up with Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'll take first watch.
Laura: Wake me up when you're tired.
Orion: I'm gonna feed Lockheed some treats.
Matt: Okay. You guys continue your business for the evening.
Marisha: I talk to Percy for a second. Percy, while we're alone for a moment, there's something that's been bothering me, and I can't get it out of my head. I thought I'd talk to you about it because I feel-- we're friends, right? We're friends? Are we friends?
Taliesin: Sure! I'd like to think so, yes.
Marisha: Been through a lot, been together a while.
Taliesin: It's been a while, yes.
Marisha: Two years now?
Taliesin: I suppose.
Sam: I go invisible to see if I can hear their conversation.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: Perception or stealth? 20.
Matt: Okay. You are keeping relatively low and are able to overhear their conversation.
Marisha: You know, you're a very brilliant person.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: I can't help but feel like I'm being watched right now. Never mind, forget I said anything. I can't help but feel like there's something else, there's something more to this that you're not telling us. And I didn't really think of anything until we were having that fight where Tiberius brutally murdered that old woman.
Taliesin: Been trying not to think about it.
Marisha: Yeah, me too. But the one thing that I can't get out of my head was something that you said during that fight. And for a long time I was like, damn, Percy's got really cool one-liners and he's so smart, and I wish I could have cool one-liners. You and Grog have really cool one-liners. And then you said "your soul is now forfeit" to the person you shot that night. And I thought, wow! That was an interesting one-liner.
Taliesin: I did say that, didn't I?
Marisha: Yeah! Yeah, you did. For some reason, I was the only one who noticed it, and I don't know if that's because I'm just reading into things, if that was just a really awesome, but scary and brutal thing to say in the moment, or if there's something deeper that you might be serving.
Taliesin: Honestly, I'll say, I've had a number of years thinking about what I would do and what I would say and how I would go about this. This kind of obsession is not healthy, and I know that, and it's no way to live. And I'm sure that was something on the list of things I thought I would say, some attempt to be scary when I met them, as opposed to being scared, I think I was-- (sighs) again, I don't really remember much because I was so angry. I've never been so angry. And I think I was just trying to sound threatening. And I'd had these dreams before, you know I've-- you don't build anything like this without the knowledge that you're-- I'm aware that inventing this thing has been a mistake.
Marisha: What thing?
Taliesin: I pull out my gun.
Marisha: Wait, what are you saying? You had knowledge? You didn't build that without inspiration? What do you mean?
Taliesin: I've had thoughts about it, but I didn't really think about what I was doing or what I was going to build until I decided to take my revenge, and I'd never thought about building it because I realized what a dangerous idea it was. (sighs) And I fear for the day that that comes back to haunt me. I don't know what I'll do, but I don't know, I think I was just trying to say something to be intimidating. I honestly didn't even think I was going to kill him, it just happened.
Marisha: Can I see if he's lying to me?
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check.
Marisha: 17.
Matt: 17. Roll a d20.
Taliesin: Is your insight really that good?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm wise as fuck!
Matt: And add your charisma modifier.
Taliesin: Add my charisma modifier? 18.
Matt: Best you can tell, he's seeming honest, and sharing open-hearted to you. You feel like you've really gotten to the core truth of what Percy's about.
Marisha: What? What did you say?
Matt: You feel like you've gotten to the core and truth of what Percy's about, and perhaps your questioning this has upset him, and you feel like maybe you've pushed this a little too far.
Taliesin: I do regret what happened and I know he was a bad man, but I still hope to never lose my temper like that again.
Liam: Got to roleplay that shit. He convinced you.
Marisha: I still really feel like we're being watched. Do you feel that? I don't know.
Taliesin: Honestly, I think we both need sleep.
Marisha: It's really distracting. Yeah. Well, I love you.
Taliesin: I love you, too.
Marisha: We're in this with you until this end.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: Let's sleep.
Matt: Okay. You guys, through your turns, the evening goes by uneventful. Morning comes to you. You can hear the distant caws of seagulls waking you up as the heat from the morning sun begins to eventually hit this side of the cave. Since you're on this side of the mountain, by the time you wake up, you realize the hour's probably a little bit past noon.
Laura: Oh shit.
Marisha: We overslept!
Orion: It's so dark in here, because of the cave thing.
Marisha: Okay, so wait. Percy, how much further out are we from Whitestone?
Matt: You gather you probably have about a day's worth of travel, and you'll be able to make your way down into the ravine from here. You've come up quite a bit of the mountain range.
Taliesin: Probably another day before we can camp close enough to attack.
Sam: Let's get going.
Laura: Should we stealth through the mountains, just in case they have any kind of lookouts?
Orion: Oh, they will have lookouts.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us again.
Liam: Let's go slower.
Laura: Should we all stealth? Try at least?
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: Let's keep stealthy.
Matt: Okay. You guys gather outside of the cavern and head up, continuing along this path. Eventually, you do notice that the path becomes broken and too steep to continue. It actually falls and tumbles down into this long, sliding ravine. There is a slight rockslide trail that you could climb up and over and it looks like there is a separate ravine, or a separation where the two mountains join, that could possibly be traversed. But continuing on the seaside path is not going to work. It does bring you inward towards-- maybe a little further south than you would have wanted to for optimal backdoor entrance into Whitestone, but it's about your only path.
Taliesin: Have I walked this path before? I never walked this path at all.
Matt: You would have had no reason to walk this path. You've heard about it, you know of this side of the mountain range, but based on your history, there's no reason you would have come here.
Orion: Whatever it takes to get to that back door.
Matt: Everyone make a stealth check, by the way. Just so we're aware of what your stealth rolls are with the Pass Without a Trace.
Laura: Add ten to it.
Liam: You get ten? Oh. Well, I got a 40, then.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: 27
Matt: 27.
Orion: Nine.
Matt: With the ten?
Orion: Oh, 19.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 32.
Travis: 27.
Laura: 37.
Matt: That's a pretty good spread. So you guys, you've hit the edge of the path. Are you heading up the rockslide trail?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay. You all, one by one, begin to climb over the trail and some rocks tumble loose beneath your feet, grasp. And you help each other get to the very top.
Orion: I use my Mage Hand to help.
Matt: (laughs) That's adorable. (laughter)
Laura: As he looks at the clock! "That's adorable."
Matt: So you all eventually manage to make it over the top of the rockslide trail and eventually it leads you to where these two large mountains come together, and there is a small path that leads between. It winds and travels downward. You can see bits of the rock have fallen and crumbled, and there are small boulders and such that just, over time and through erosion, have tumbled down this ravine to start filling it with occasional chunks of stone. You begin walking through this ravine for another good 45 minutes to an hour, keeping a keen eye out.
Orion: Is this the same ravine that we're travelling across?
Matt: Basically, you guys have been traveling up the side of the coast. You've now turned inward over the mountain range to head down into the valley of Whitestone. You are currently just now heading up through the mountain range, inwards towards the mountain.
Taliesin: Is this the river?
Matt: There's no river here. It's just stone that comes together for a pathway in between. This is where two large peaks of the mountains basically come to join at the bottom.
Taliesin: Okay, so we're not at the river.
Matt: No, the river is actually inside the valley and to the south of Whitestone. So pressing down I would like you all to roll a perception check.
Laura: Jesus.
Marisha: Ah, that's all right.
Sam: One!
Laura: Natural 20!
Liam: Natural 20!
Liam: Yeah!
Matt: One, one, 20, 20.
Orion: 16.
Marisha: 14.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Okay. As all of you guys are charging forward, both Vex and Vax, you hear this slight noise of a couple rocks (clattering) in the ravine behind you. You both turn and look and for a split second you swear you see between some of the rocks and paths of jagged stone that mark the walls of this ravine, you see a quick blur of blue that vanishes behind a higher platform above you.
Liam: Smurfs!
Laura: A blur of blue?
Matt: A large blur of blue just disappears behind one of the outcroppings that's blocking your view of higher up the ravine.
Laura: (shushes) Down. Hide.
Orion: I cast Stoneskin.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Stealth.
Orion: I fasten my Cloak of Displacement.
Laura: And I prepare--
Matt: You guys prepare for a second, and as you're all paying attention, you guys also see another shift of blue (whoosh) go across the way. And this time you see it's something large and blue that moves across the stone and goes into a small cavern that looks about 25 feet up the way that's just past your visual range from this low in the ravine.
Laura: Do we have any visual on what it could be?
Matt: It moved very quickly, and for a split second, you could see it appeared to be-- the way it moved was almost serpentine, like (whoosh) and vanished inside. You swear you saw limbs, though. It wasn't a giant snake. There was something attached to it.
Laura: (whispering) Wyvern? I look at Keyleth. Keyleth. (louder) And I whisper, but for sake of microphones, do you know of a creature that's blue, and fast, and is kind of snakey but has arms and legs?
Marisha: Let me think about it for a second. Do I know a creature that's blue and snakey?
Liam: It sounds like basilisks, but they're too slow.
Matt: What did you roll?
Marisha: I don't know. Ooh, that's 24.
Matt: 24. You've heard of various lizard-like creatures that grow to large sizes. Usually those fall into the realm of dragons and such. The color blue, though, is uncommon, unless it were a blue dragon. However, the motion of this creature does not seem to necessarily be the territory of a blue dragon. It's hard to point exactly what this is, but you do know it's probably something in the serpentine-type magical realm.
Taliesin: I heard them, I heard them describe it. Would I know it from the description? Just from my local knowledge?
Matt: Go ahead and make a history check.
Marisha: The blue thing's weird. The blue thing is what's throwing me.
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: Nine. Unfortunately, nothing of this type has come across you. If it has, it's been too long, and you've forgotten it. There are a number of dangerous things that exist in these mountains.
Laura: I've got a really good idea. Wait. No! Grog, pick up something really heavy, and throw it as far as you can.
Travis: I go over and I grab Scanlan--
Sam: No!
Laura: A boulder or something.
Travis: I put Scanlan down. Find a large rock that's tumbled down, maybe.
Matt: Yeah, they're easy to find. There's like some that are this big, some that are larger. They're really heavy.
Travis: And I discus the thing and (whoosh).
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: Well, that was great. 24.
Matt: (whoosh) You release the rock. (impact) It skids to a halt. As it does, you can see suddenly over the course (whoosh) something very quickly move, and it's a head. It's a snout. You see it's probably a good six, seven-foot wide. A giant, lizard-like, toothy jaw. Blue scales against it with large kind of horned ridges across the back of its head. And its claws (clacking) on the edge. Looks down. Looks down at the rest of you. Rears back.
Laura: It saw us?
Liam: Didn't see me.
Orion: Well, of course it saw us.
Laura: With 37 stealth, yo. It saw us?
Marisha: But it didn't seem to give a shit?
Matt: It just withdrew over the edge.
Sam: Should we run?
Laura: Maybe just move really fast away from him
Marisha: I can, I can cast Anti-Life Shell on us. Then we can haul ass really fast.
Sam: Will it move with us, your shell?
Marisha: Yeah, as long as you stay close to me. It moves with me.
Liam: Yeah, fuck this thing. Let's get out of here.
Marisha: Okay! I cast Anti-Life Shell. Stay close!
Matt: Okay. As you begin casting and finish the spell. As the sphere appears-- at which point you now see a large blue blur (whoosh) dart off of the cliffside into the air (impact noise) and skidding right in front of you guys, blocking off the side of the ravine you guys were running towards. You can now see it: a huge, elongated, serpentine body covered in blue scales and horns. You can see what looks to be six to eight arms and a series of legs all across its long, snakelike torso. As it looks it snarls at you all (snarls). And you see sparks of energy, electricity (sparking noises) in its jaw. (growls, roars)
Liam: Salamander?
Matt: And that's where we're going it end tonight! (yelling)
Laura: Oh, jeez Louise!
Sam: You can't do that!
Matt: I can, because it's 10 30.
Liam: No, it's not. It's like 8 45.
Matt: We can keep going if you guys want to stay long. It's Thursday night.
Zac: I'm coming to you with my laptop before you continue.
Liam: Who's that guy?
Matt: But to give you a little perspective, that is what essentially you'd be facing. (loud reactions)
Laura: What the fuck? It's got so many arms.
Liam: That's a kobold.
Matt: Yeah, totally. Kobold. [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome, everyone, to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer, I'm the Dungeon Master. For those who are returning, good to see you again, and for those for the first time, welcome, and hopefully you're not too lost. So, Sam is on his way right now, being in the usual traffic from wherever he comes from, being a professional. Having a career that's functional and perpetually busy. Get here soon, Sam! Quickly, please! Drive safe. Don't drive with children in the street. Apparently, that was confusion from last time. People thought that he was actually driving in children. Like, he had problems with children and traffic, and thought children in traffic. So, keep your children out of traffic, if you don't mind. That's a general Critical Role request.
Marisha: PSA.
Matt: PSA, yeah. Before we get started in this, first and foremost, I want to say hello to our guest for the evening, Mr. Chris Hardwick. (cheering)
Chris hardwick: Good to be here.
Matt: Glad you could join us for tonight's game.
Chris hardwick: Also very excited to be here on Ravenclaw Appreciation Day: the best house, of course.
Marisha: Yes, that's true.
Chris hardwick: Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure.
Laura: Hufflepuff!
Chris hardwick: Well...
Taliesin: Slytherin. Slytherin. Ravenclaw's pretty good. Pretty good.
Chris hardwick: If by good, you mean the best.
Matt: There you go.
Chris hardwick: I'm sorry, there's no--
Sam: Oh, shit! This is so awkward.
Taliesin: I thought we called you.
Chris hardwick: Can you stand near the bear?
Laura: His name is Trinket, all right?
Sam: Is this how I was fired from the show?
Chris hardwick: We thought we would do it on the livestream just to really help capture the traffic that that would bring.
Sam: Good luck. I think you're going to do great. These guys will take care of you.
Chris hardwick: I've been working with this guy for the last couple of years on Sanjay & Craig. He gets all businessy, he's a responsible adult in the workplace.
Matt: And then he comes here.
Sam: And then I come here. You're not, you're the same.
Chris hardwick: I can't wait to see this other side.
Sam: Where am I supposed to sit?! Right here?
Matt: Right there, yeah. Just scoot in.
Sam: Is that true? I don't know. Are we scooting over?
Chris hardwick: I would move over, but I need both. My legs are--
Sam: This is the most awkward.
Taliesin: It's like a New York subway over here.
Chris hardwick: Can you just rappel down that?
Matt: There we go.
Laura: This is so awkward.
Sam: I love it. No, no, I've got the half-table at the end here. It's great.
Chris hardwick: Matt, I don't like having people on my right side. Is this weird?
Matt: If becomes a problem, just raise your hand and scream.
Chris hardwick: It's already a problem.
Matt: Oh, damn it!
Marisha: I'm technically at the end. This is on Chris, really.
Liam: Can you scoot the whole bench down on this side?
Laura: Yeah, scoot the bench down. Look at how far the bench is on our side.
Travis: Put the leg of the table between here.
Matt: Very well-oiled machine, Critical Role.
Laura: Thanks for joining us this week.
Matt: The utmost of presentory quality we promise to you on a weekly basis. Thank you for joining us. All right, so.
Travis: Lock it up, right table, Jesus!
Sam: Sorry, we're ready.
Matt: Welcome, Sam, glad you could make it. Let's get through our announcements quickly for the week. Tomorrow, a bunch of us are going to be at Wondercon down at the LA Convention Center. Not Anaheim. It's always been at Anaheim, and I thought it was Anaheim when I mentioned it last week. But, no, it's in LA because everything likes to prove me wrong. We'll be there. 7:00-8:00pm is our Critical Role panel, so if you're in the area, you're coming to the event, come say hello, bring questions, preferably not punch me in the face for getting it wrong with Anaheim.
Chris hardwick: It used to be in San Francisco.
Matt: Even before that!
Chris hardwick: Yeah! I went to it at Moscone Center like six or seven years ago, and then Anaheim. It's getting closer and closer.
Marisha: Yeah, it's going to be in Lancaster next year.
Taliesin: And the year after, it's going to be at my house. It'll be great.
Matt: We will go there for that. Going to Lancaster for anything is a difficult choice. Sorry, Lancaster!
Laura: Longest announcements ever!
Matt: I know! We have, tonight--
Marisha: Shirts!
Matt: I'm getting to it! We had an issue last week where a bunch of our Gilmore shirts sold out really quickly.
Sam: This shirt, right here?
Matt: That shirt that you're wearing, the Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Laura: The one that everybody wants, but nobody can have.
Sam: I have it!
Matt: That's terrible.
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Chris hardwick: Do I have to sit next to him?
Travis: The whole time.
Sam: Don't worry, I've already been emasculated. (laughter)
Matt: We're counting it as community service, it'll be fine. However, in trying to make sure that we can help our folks who don't get to see it live have an opportunity at these, we're going to be starting for a week a limited pre-order for Gilmore shirts. Should be up live now on the website. So if you didn't have the opportunity to go ahead and grab your own Gilmore's Glorious Goods shirt, go to GeekandSundry.com right now, go to their store, it should be available for pre-orders for the next week.
Liam: Grab this unicorn by the horn.
Matt: Yes. Yes. Grog-- Travis, but Grog. You're wearing a delightful shirt, there. Would you like to tell us a bit about that shirt?
Travis: This is the next of our shirt designs--
Sam: Oh, is that true?
Travis: -- the Strongjaw Ale shirt design, which will be on sale tomorrow at our Wondercon panel and the Geek and Sundry store as well.
Liam: That is manly.
Travis: Aged six months in a Bag of Holding. (laughter)
Laura: You can read?
Travis: Upside-down only.
Matt: Makes sense. Anyone else have any announcements they want to bring up?
Taliesin: Yeah, I can now be your companion, as of this week, in Fallout 4, if you build a robot and give it the male voice, I can be really polite to you for hours on end.
Laura: Yay!
Matt: Yay!
Taliesin: You can have me be very polite. That's the only way you can have me be very polite.
Matt: You can make him very polite, and apparently be sexy Codsworth, which is the new internet thing. It's the Codsworth top with the normal legs at the bottom, and it's just sexy running Codsworth, with Taliesin's voice. So do that.
Taliesin: That horrifies me.
Chris hardwick: May I promote just a quick thing?
Matt: Of course, please!
Chris hardwick: We're doing the Nerdist panel Sunday at Wondercon, and then I'm going to do a signing right afterwards, I think 11 and 12 are the two times for that, and then, if you have a chance, I just posted on Facebook the full, unedited episode. We did a Trump v. Sanders debate on @Midnight last night, and it was really fun.
Matt: It's awesome.
Chris hardwick: And they extended it to an hour because it was so much fun, so it's on Facebook now, and just go and share it, please, because we enjoyed making it.
Matt: It's awesome, seriously.
Chris hardwick: Thank you very much.
Matt: Of course, of course, yeah, check that one out. I caught that earlier today, haphazardly, and I'm glad I did. And you'll be glad too.
Marisha: Did it trend on Twitter? That's where I saw it.
Chris hardwick: It did, yeah, last night it did and then we stuck it up today. And then a comedy special on Comedy Central, Funcomfortable, April 30th.
Matt: April 30th. Heck yeah, man, congrats. (cheering)
Matt: That'll be awesome. All righty.
Liam: Oh my gosh, 'critrole' is the code you need for free shipping if you want Wyrmwood Gaming boxes to hold your dice in them. We all have them. I have some at home. My kids love them. Critrole is the code you need for free shipping.
Travis: (belches)
Chris hardwick: I expected a bassier belch.
Travis: Yeah, I know, it comes from her, though, she's like a howitzer, it's a whole other thing.
Laura: Yeah. I'll surprise you with it, don't worry.
Travis: It'll make your shirt move, it's legit.
Matt: No, like, she'll actually surprise you, she'll wait until you're walking through a parking garage at two am and just over your shoulder (belches).
Travis: Telephone rings. Hello? (belches)
Matt: Exactly. She's good. Anyone have anything else they want to announce before we jump into the game?
Sam: I'm sitting on half a chair.
Matt: Thank you for that, Sam.
Chris hardwick: Scoot a cheek here.
Sam: No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Laura: He's not fine.
Chris hardwick: It was important enough for you to bring it up, Sam.
Sam: I'm fine, Christopher.
Liam: His character is small, but he has a big personality.
Chris hardwick: How do you do this every week?
Matt: That's a good, good question.
Taliesin: Normally sedated.
Matt: All righty. So. Let's go ahead and jump into this wondrous--
Taliesin: Oh, god.
Matt: So, to get you guys a little bit up to speed with some of the fun that's happened previously on Critical Role, our band of intrepid adventurers, Vox Machina, after having a horrible encounter with the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of chromatic evil dragons that has just torn through the Tal'Dorei countryside, destroying cityscape after cityscape, the party has fled and has been seeking information on how to possibly eventually topple these creatures and restore order to the land of Tal'Dorei. They began seeking these artifacts known as the Vestiges of Divergence that promise ancient power from wars long past that could aid them in this journey. After acquiring one, with a near-death experience by Vex'ahlia over there, they began their next step in the journey. However, as part of a recent scrying spell by Keyleth, the druid, they discovered that the Pyrah tribe of her druidic heritage, the Ashari, were decimated as their home of Pyrah was the portal to the fire elemental plane that they normally guard, was where Thordak the Cinder King, the great red dragon, tore through into this prime realm and managed to seemingly wipe out most if not all of the tribe. Vox Machina made the relatively grim journey back to the mountainside, finding it now brimming with volcanic rock and volcanic activity that previously lay dormant. Upon climbing the side of the mountain, you found remnants of the Pyrah tribe still alive, and making their way up the mountain, as damaged as they are, in hopes of sealing this now progressively swelling tear between the prime material plane and the elemental plane of fire. Not just that, there was aid that came to the Pyrah tribe. And it involved a number of Air Ashari, one of which was Korren, Keyleth's father. There was a brief, tearful exchange and reunion before the rest of you, steeling yourselves, began to walk in towards the center of the mountain's caldera, towards the remnants of the Cindergrove, the now-destroyed and sundered petrified forest, in hopes of closing this rippling tear to the elemental plane once and for all. And this is where we begin. So. The group of the six of you, gathering alongside the dozen or so Pyrah members, with various burns, Cerkonos, who is the leader of the tribe, now missing his arm, cauterized at the shoulder, all advancing forward quietly in this tense push of necessity. You can see in the distance, swirling between the trees, clusters of glowing elemental entities that are either spilling forth from this recently and have taken this landscape as their own, or are just enjoying in their-- elementals like to burn shit. And so you're seeing fire elementals wandering about, just tearing through what remains of this countryside, and let's see, you actually, Vex'ahlia-- as you guys are stepping forward, keeping an eye on these glowing distant entities, these creatures, you catch out of the corner of your eye what appears to be a number of other humanoids, a small cluster of shadowed individuals far off to the left, tucked around the bottom of a tree.
Laura: I ask everyone to wait. Percy.
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: Can you look through your scope and see who that is?
Taliesin: I'll take a look.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: First roll.
Taliesin: Ooh. That's not bad. (eerie music)
Laura: The music.
Liam: The violins go south.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: 23. Glancing over in that direction, you see, towards one of the larger, broken petrified trees, right on the outskirts of the Cindergrove forest, you see what appear to be a cluster of humanoids. Two of them have flesh. The other two do not. These skeletal creatures shuffle in place, clutching a blade to one side, while the other two appear to be in partially rotted states. They're mostly disinterested in their surroundings and stand there, head to the side, aimless--
Taliesin: Are they in the clothing of the natives, or do they not look to be Ashari?
Matt: From what you can tell, one of them does appear to have Ashari wardrobe. The other one does not.
Travis: -- he said in a weird way.
Taliesin: They look undead. Doesn't--
Laura: Are they from here?
Taliesin: Possibly. One looks vaguely familiar, but there's something wrong. We should proceed-- let's go up and find out what's happening. Slowly, and armed.
Matt: At this point, Korren, Keyleth's father and the head of the Air Ashari in your absence, puts his hand forth and goes, "I'm sorry, you're saying that you see along the way undead creatures."
Taliesin: Yes. There's something unnatural over in that direction. We should probably be the ones to investigate.
Matt: "All right. Given the nature of the elemental presence here, we're going to have to probably divide and attack the central place from multiple positions, otherwise they're going to have too strong of a fire-front at the edges of this border. Do you feel confident enough to handle your own sliver of this assault?"
Travis: (scoffs and laughs) Is he serious?
Marisha: Grog. I believe we can handle it.
Laura: We don't have a lot of magic wielders with us, though.
Matt: "That's all right--"
Sam: (clears throat) I'm pretty good.
Laura: A lot of magic wielders.
Travis: Yeah, you're better than good, buddy.
Taliesin: You're okay.
Matt: "Well, we'll keep an eye out. We'll have two of our druids overhead, keeping eyesight. If anything goes wrong, signal up there. You know how, Keyleth. And we'll send them down to aid you. All right."
Laura: Sounds good.
Matt: "The air Ashari will come from the northeast. Cerkonos, take the rest of your tribe, head from the west. You, continue on forward. If this troupe you've found of seemingly lifeless entities looks even remotely dangerous, do not engage. They are not our target. But if this is a scourge that has spread into the Cindergrove, I fear we may be in worse shape than I had originally envisioned. Regardless, stay silent, stay swift." He looks back to the rest of the Air Ashari, and all of them, their outer form shimmers as the wind begins to collect around their feet, ever so quietly, and they all with an intense speed begin to trek at an incredible pace, seemingly blending in with the rock surroundings as they go, disappearing around one side of the Cindergrove forest. Cerkonos and the others nod. Cerkonos looks to the rest of you, brings up his one hand and gives a touch to the top of his chest and sternum and bows his head and goes, "I wish you all great luck. See you on the inside." And the rest of the fire Ashari turn into burning fire elemental forms and begin to streak through the various broken rocks and pieces of glass-shattered obsidian that peppered this landscape in the caldera, leaving the six of you ready to trek forward yourself.
Travis: Scanlan, can you do that?
Sam: Ah, no. No, and I don't think I could learn.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: Perfect. So.
Marisha: Let's go.
Laura: Avoid the skeletons?
Marisha: Avoid the skeletons.
Taliesin: Let's take a look, at least.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: We're supposed to make sure they're not part of something larger that's heading in--
Laura: They're in the way, Keyleth.
Marisha: Did you not just hear my father--
Taliesin: He said if they don't bother us, to leave them alone, but that we should just check to make sure that they're not part of something.
Laura: Are they in the path at all, do they look like they're going to be near us when we go?
Matt: They look like, wherever you're traveling-- because there's an open expanse of about 80 or so feet before you actually reach the edge of the Cindergrove, and they're right on the outskirts of the Cindergrove forest, so lest you're very careful, they would technically see you if they're paying attention.
Travis: Yes!
Taliesin: Tread gently and see if they react.
Marisha: Do you have Pass Without a Trace, Vex?
Laura: I do. But, Keyleth, the minute we start fighting, they will notice us, and then they'll attack us from behind.
Taliesin: So it would be best to get their attention now when everything's quiet.
Marisha: We also don't want to waste all of our abilities on undead.
Taliesin: There's only two, maybe four of them.
Matt: There's four of them.
Liam: That we see.
Marisha: Why don't we just tread that way, and we'll see what happens.
Taliesin: That's exactly what we're saying.
Sam: What could happen?
Laura: I guess I use Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Taliesin: You did.
Marisha: Did we already have it?
Laura: Did we already have it? From last time?
Matt: As long as you're maintaining your concentration, how long does it last for? Concentration? I believe it--
Laura: It holds for up to an hour.
Matt: An hour, yeah, so you can still be under that effect.
Laura: Sweet.
Matt: So I would like all six of you to roll stealth checks for me, if you could.
Travis: With triple advantage?
Matt: No. Just the plus ten. Which is better than advantage.
Marisha: Triple advantage.
Travis: 25.
Taliesin: 30.
Marisha: 28.
Liam: 38.
Laura: 30.
Matt: 38--
Sam: 14. (laughter)
Matt: With plus ten?
Sam: With the plus ten.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Incredible.
Sam: Tra-la-la-la-la.
Matt: So as the entire group bends down into a ninja-like stance, just darting across as fast as they can, keeping low to the ground and using much of the shadow of the overhead clouds and smoke that has completely engulfed the above skyscape, behind you, bounding very loudly, is a gentle gnome, swishing brown hair--
Sam: I'm trying to do that thing that the Ashari just did.
Matt: Right. It's not working.
Liam: Hot, hot, hot.
Matt: And as you're darting across, you're jumping over little open globules of molten lava that is starting to pour out from various crevices in the stone floor, you try to hop around to avoid that, and in doing so, your foot catches the edge of a piece of stone, and you begin to go into a tumble. Make an acrobatics check.
Sam: Oh, yes. Mm-hm. Oh, disadvantage, because I'm exhausted.
Matt: You are.
Laura: Oh, shit. I forgot about that.
Liam: The honest gnome.
Sam: Okay. 14.
Matt: (laughs) You do manage to catch yourself, with a slight tumble, skid a bit on your ass, and land on your feet. It would've been a cool three-point landing if anyone else had attempted it, but you just barely catch yourself, look back at the group with a sheepish grin, and out of the corner of your eye, you see one of the undead entities turn its head and look right in your direction.
Laura: (whispering) Good job, Scanlan.
Sam: (whispering) I think it saw Grog.
Travis: Sorry.
Matt: It starts wandering in your direction.
Sam: Should we engage or keep going?
Marisha: I'm afraid if we engage, it could draw attention to an entire slew of what could be around.
Taliesin: Let's just put it down quietly.
Marisha: All right, Jesus Christ.
Taliesin: No magic.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Just weapons.
Laura: No guns.
Taliesin: No guns. I pull my sword.
Marisha: Vex, you might be the most capable of this.
Laura: I shoot it with an arrow.
Matt: All right, roll for an attack.
Laura: Okay. Just going for it. Okay.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: I'm literally, I think I cursed myself sometime between here and San Francisco.
Taliesin: The d20s talk to each other and they know that you're not true.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: Can I attack on her heels when she's done?
Matt: At this distance, it'll take a little bit to rush up if you want to--
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: I'll say at this point they're roughly 60 feet from you, so if you wanted to--
Liam: That's my distance.
Matt: Oh, if you go full speed, you can.
Marisha: Daggers.
Matt: Oh, throwing it.
Laura: 15 damage.
Matt: 15 damage. On which one, the skeleton or--
Laura: Oh, that's sneak attack, right? Because I'm hidden.
Matt: It would be from you, yes. The--
Laura: Extra two.
Matt: What? Extra two. Okay. Is this against one of the zombies or one of the skeletons?
Laura: I was doing the one that was walking towards us, I thought the other ones were still in the area--
Matt: All right, then that would be one of the zombies.
Laura: Yeah, okay.
Matt: All right. The arrow streaks through the air, slamming into the chest, and it embeds itself, causing a piece of tendon to snap and curl back inside the torso. Its arm falls a little more limp than it was previously, and it just keeps walking forward.
Laura: I hide.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll a stealth check. You--
Liam: They're all grouped together?
Matt: Three of them are grouped together by the tree. The one that noticed is slowly wandering toward you.
Liam: All right, so I'm going to throw at that one as well.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 39. Stealth.
Matt: All right.
Liam: I'm just going to throw one, and just to check, I'm hidden, yeah?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: So this is Assassinate, I have advantage because it hasn't gone yet, and it's a crit because I'm surprising it.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. With that, as this zombie entity is hobbling forward, the dagger strikes it right in the center of the skull, right where its mouth and jaw hinge hit, severs the base of the skull to the spine, and the head just rolls off onto the ground underneath. The body takes two more steps before falling forward.
Laura: Yeah, do they all-- did any of the other ones notice that?
Matt: All the other undead creatures all of a sudden turn into the forest, as opposed to towards where the death happened--
Laura: Ah, shit.
Matt: And you see running out from the forest towards you, a blue-skinned humanoid, rushing out, arms in the air.
Chris hardwick: (in an Irish accent) Stop, stop, stop what you're doing! Stop it! What have you done? What have you fucking done? It wasn't hurting anybody! I don't understand it. Jesus Christ, these are not easy to make.
Travis: Are we killing this one?
Sam: No, no, don't kill him, he's precious.
Chris hardwick: What did I do?
Sam: Who are you? Who are you?
Chris hardwick: Who are you, you're fucking shooting at me, you're asking me questions!
Sam: But these are zombies, these are undead, these are creatures of evil!
Laura: They were attacking us, they were attacking him!
Chris hardwick: These were in my employ.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: Well, you should keep a leash on them, then.
Chris hardwick: That would be inhumane, wouldn't it?
Sam: They're not human.
Chris hardwick: Well, they were, that's very disrespectful of you, I don't appreciate it.
Liam: Are they pets? Are they friends? Where were you--
Chris hardwick: They're friend-pets.
Liam: You have to be around, though. To keep an eye on them.
Chris hardwick: I know, but I've been traveling out here for a while, and so they provide a layer of protection. Certainly not great now. Now they were four, now there's three.
Liam: Well, listen, when we see these things without an owner around, we take them out, I'm sorry, it's pretty standard.
Sam: This can't be the first time this has happened.
Chris hardwick: It does happen quite a lot, actually, yes. Now that I think about it, it's probably a little bit on me, I suppose.
Sam: Can you make them vests or something that says 'service'?
Chris hardwick: That's a nice idea, as I'm a vest-maker.
Laura: Put them in a bright color, put a happy mask on them or something, so people know they're nice.
Chris hardwick: Certainly, yeah, yeah, masks and vests, that's a great idea.
Matt: You see agreeing before you a blue-scaled dragonborn. If you would like to describe yourself for the party.
Chris hardwick: Yes, sorry, I forgot. Where are my manners? My name is Gern Blanston.
Sam: No, it's not.
Chris hardwick: It's Gern Blanston.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Chris hardwick: This one's very rude.
Travis: He is.
Chris hardwick: You look exhausted.
Sam: This volcano-- do you live near here? This volcano really takes the piss out of you.
Chris hardwick: No, no, no, I don't live near here. Listen, I've been traveling, I'm a simple candlemaker.
Sam: What are you doing on top of a volcano?
Chris hardwick: A volcano is nature's candle! What a stupid question.
Laura: You make candles, but you also make undead?
Chris hardwick: Yes. They're-- yes. They're like people-candles.
Laura: Can I insight and see if he's telling the truth?
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Our lives are so bizarre now.
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17. He's telling the truth.
Chris hardwick: Why is my brain tingling? Is someone noodling around inside there?
Matt: She eyes you up and down, trying to get a feel for whether or not you're who you say you are.
Chris hardwick: I make special candles. I make special candles. I'm searching for some magical items up here in this volcano. I understand there was a wee bit of damage not long ago from a dragon that had torn through the region, and so I'm just searching for scraps to make these simple candles. That's why-- this is my dance vest. I think dancing is very important. I'm alone most of the time, it keeps me occupied. They have no appreciation for the arts, these undead creatures that are friend-pets, and, you know, I've just been digging around up here, seeing what I can scrounge up and find. What are you lot?
Travis: Wait, are they special candles or are they simple candles?
Chris hardwick: Well, some are simple. Some just create light, and others create tragedy for people.
Sam: They're magical candles?
Chris hardwick: Yes, in a word. Actually, magic is the perfect word.
Marisha: Who exactly is the patronage of your candle business? Who do you sell to?
Chris hardwick: I mean, I sell to no one in particular, really. I have to be a little choosy about who gets the candles, but it's something that I've crafted over the years.
Sam: Well, we feel dreadful about killing one of your pets.
Marisha: I'm so sorry.
Sam: Perhaps we can purchase a candle off of you to make amends.
Chris hardwick: Well, maybe you could just kill someone else, and then I could just bring them back, I mean, that would be a wonderful way to repay.
Laura: Well, you know what, we're on our way to do just that thing.
Chris hardwick: Really?
Marisha: Things do tend to die around us a lot.
Travis: Something larger things, sometimes smaller things.
Sam: Would you like a body to reanimate or something?
Marisha: You might get something even bigger.
Chris hardwick: Are you inviting me to come along with you?
Sam: I don't know. Are we?
Chris hardwick: Did I just invite myself to come along with you?
Travis: Well maybe, like, if you give us one of those tragedy candles, we can always light it for somebody. That could be good down the road.
Marisha: Oh, like candles for funerals? That's sad. We do have a lot of tragedy.
Travis: We bake somebody a cake, we shove a candle in the top, and we give it to them.
Chris hardwick: I don't think that would be a grand idea unless you didn't like the person very much.
Travis: Well, that's what I meant, yeah.
Chris hardwick: Well, I think for now I'll just hold onto the candles I have and just see how things pan out. I really don't know any of you.
Sam: We're Vox Machina, a traveling band of adventurers led by me, Scanlan Shorthalt, and these are my compatriots. We're on a very important mission to get-- what are we doing?
Marisha: We're trying to close this giant rift that we're walking into.
Sam: We have to break something big and scary.
Chris hardwick: What's your name again?
Sam: Scanlan Shorthalt.
Chris hardwick: No, what's the name of your group?
Laura: Vox Machina.
Chris hardwick: No offense, but that sounds like a shite band.
Laura: Thank you.
Chris hardwick: Are you musicians?
Taliesin: It's better than Tragedy Candle, really, I mean that's a shite band, to be fair.
Chris hardwick: (laughs) They opened for Vox Machina. They were fantastic. Oh, am I not thinking of the right thing? That's all right.
Sam: I'm a musician.
Chris hardwick: Excellent.
Sam: But these people, they can't really hold a tune so much.
Chris hardwick: Listen, seeing as how that you've killed one of my undead thralls, it'd be really nice if I could join you to see if maybe we can scrounge up some other things along the way.
Laura: Then you'll help us?
Chris hardwick: I mean, we'll see how it pans out, but I feel like everything would come to an abrupt ending if I just walked away at this point.
Laura: It would be very strange.
Chris hardwick: Thoroughly unsatisfying for anyone else who might be witnessing this exchange.
Sam: Your undead pets, are they going to try and eat our brains or anything?
Chris hardwick: No, no, they're just fine. That right there is Coral, and that's Stimpy, and that's Fatty Arbuckle.
Sam: Who was the one that we killed?
Chris hardwick: Oh, that was Carol. Very sad, very sad indeed.
Laura: Carol and Coral?
Chris hardwick: Carol and Coral. I get them confused.
Marisha: Were they sisters?
Chris hardwick: No, no, no, they were not initially related, but we became a makeshift family after a while.
Sam: Oh, that's very beautiful.
Chris hardwick: I notice subtle differences that most of the living doesn't notice.
Travis: Aren't we supposed to be doing something really like--
Laura: Yeah, tell you what, Gern, we're actually--
Liam: It's dangerous around us, I don't know--
Laura: We should probably press on, and you can join us with your family.
Chris hardwick: Please, that would be very nice.
Travis: What was your name, one more time?
Chris hardwick: Gern Blanston.
Travis: Yeah, okay.
Chris hardwick: Gern.
Travis: Well, let's go, let's move along then, Gern, yeah? You good to come along with your herd of--
Sam: Can you fight and stuff in case shit goes down?
Marisha: If you make magical candles, you must know a little bit of magic, correct?
Chris hardwick: I'm a little bit better of a spellcaster than I am a fisticuffs type of person.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Perfect. We're short on magic people. That's wonderful.
Chris hardwick: Excellent. No offense.
Sam: All taken.
Travis: We move along.
Laura: Are we still trying to stealth? Or does it even matter?
Liam: Your dead things don't stealth, I would assume?
Chris hardwick: They're not very delicate, unfortunately. No, no, they're really for protection. Now, the zombies can really take a lot of damage to the front of the chest and the skeletons are quite quick, actually. So, you know. They've been fairly good for a while.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Good to know.
Laura: We head towards the thing.
Travis: Stealthily.
Chris hardwick: To the thing!
Travis: Shush! Stealthily.
Chris hardwick: (whispering) To the thing!
Matt: Go ahead and make a stealth check, if you don't mind, Gern.
Laura: Does my Pass Without a Trace work on him too, does it like envelop him--
Matt: Nope. He wasn't there when you cast it.
Chris hardwick: 11.
Travis: Fuck.
Matt: 11?
Taliesin: He's not under Pass Without a Trace.
Matt: No, and then-- No. As you guys begin stealthily, there is a couple of (footfalls) heavy footfalls of the lumbering dragonborn.
Chris hardwick: These old dragon feet--
Matt: No tail on this one.
Sam: What happened to your tail?
Chris hardwick: Please don't ask me about that.
Sam: Okay, I won't.
Matt: The only other dragonborn you've seen without a tail was the paladin that worked in the Council. Tofor Brotorus. So, that does catch your attention a little bit. Not just the dragonborn lumbering, but now the three undead that are (groaning) stepping behind.
Laura: They're worse than Trinket, Scanlan.
Marisha: I don't know. I don't know if stealth is going to be a thing, going forward.
Taliesin: (whistling)
Travis: Yeah! (whistles)
Laura: Okay.
Chris hardwick: Sorry, these dragon lips can't whistle. Mostly just fire comes out.
Matt: And it's at that point you hear the cracking of what sounds like heavy timber, no more than 30 feet away from you. You all stop in place suddenly and you glance over and you can see the flickering of light of what appears to be a flame-based elemental energy that's tearing over the side of a newly fallen petrifoid-- petrifoid-- (mocking Chris' accent) petrifoid tree, look what you've done to me! This is your fault!
Travis: Gern, son of a bitch.
Chris hardwick: Purple hearts, green stars! Purple hearts.
Sam: Seen some shit.
Chris hardwick: Special veteran's edition of Lucky Charms.
Matt: Very, very Lucky Charms.
Chris hardwick: Very Lucky Charms.
Liam: Shit.
Matt: So!
Taliesin: Well, that got dark.
Matt: Yeah, how about that?
Liam: Back to normal, then, eh?
Taliesin: Yeah, okay.
Matt: So. As the flame begins to trickle and burn over the edge, you can see there is an intelligence to it. There are a couple of arms that writhe over the side and the head pops over and glances, and stops in place, frozen, staring over in the direction of the bounding dragonborn.
Marisha: It's a fire elemental?
Matt: It's smaller than what you're used to seeing, but it is indeed a creature made of elemental flame.
Marisha: Would he be considered a primordial?
Matt: It would be considered an elemental.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to go fire elemental.
Matt: Okay. So you're using your transform--
Marisha: Seeing it, I'm going to transform and go into my fire elemental.
Travis: Is this the first time you've done that?
Laura: No no, she's done that.
Marisha: Is this the first time I've been fire elemental?
Matt: I think it's the first time you've been fire elemental, yeah?
Laura: Really?
Marisha: Yeah, learned from Cerkonos, yeah.
Matt: So, you guys watch as Keyleth's form suddenly erupts into flame, which freaks you out for a second, as you're uncertain as to whether or not she did that.
Travis: Keyleth! Are you all right?
Marisha: In fire elemental, just like--
Laura: Does it still look like Keyleth or-- what does it look like?
Matt: It has for a moment, an essence of Keyleth's more lithe form that most elementals would, but still these long, curling flame like-arms, these eyes that glow a bright white fire in the center of the face. Other than that, relatively formless other than what looks like where her hair would be, these wisps of flame curl up behind her.
Laura: Pretty freaking sick. Can you talk to it?
Marisha: That's what I'm going to go do.
Matt: So as you approach the elemental form--
Marisha: So I approach and I'm going to do the animal instinct thing and poof up and make myself a little big.
Matt: The creature behind the form, you can see, is drifting away from the trunk of the tree.
Marisha: Oh, it's running from me?
Matt: It's turned away and is moving away from you, yeah.
Sam: That was easy.
Marisha: Deuces. And I roll back.
Laura: I thought we were supposed to keep them from coming out into this world.
Marisha: Are we-- wait. Are we in the fire plane yet?
Matt: No no, you're just-- you're in the caldera to--
Marisha: Oh, we're in the caldera.
Matt: Yeah, you haven't traversed the plane. You're making your way into the remnants of the Cindergrove.
Laura: Maybe you should ask it to go back.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to say "Halt!" in Ignan. Which I'm assuming it speaks.
Matt: You guys hear in the distance this echo of this weird sucking-crackling sound that goes-- It halts for a second, looks over its shoulder and then goes into double speed, disappearing into the trees. Away from you.
Travis: Kind of following your lead here.
Marisha: I follow after it and I say, in the name of the guardians of this realm, you will stop!
Matt: Okay, as you follow it past the initial treeline, it's where a bunch of trees have fallen over and formed a small blockade in this portion of the forest. You glance over as you're shouting that and you can see what appear to be another of the same small elemental that this one has gone to, to have a brief conversation. Beyond that, you see a larger one, roughly your size, that has just turned around and noticed your presence, and all of them look over at what appears to be another humanoid creature, but instead of a lower torso of legs, it's an elongated snake-like body, its black and red scales across its entire form, two human arms and a humanoid face but these webbed red spines down its entire back.
Sam: Gern, is that one of yours? That's you, Gern. Gern.
Chris hardwick: No, I don't know who this is. I don't-- I'm not familiar. I'm not familiar with who this is.
Laura: I take my potion of fire resistance.
Chris hardwick: I could send them a present in the form of a candle, if you prefer.
Laura: Do it.
Matt: At this point in time, Keyleth, as you're standing there, looking over this edge, they all turn and the creature, the weird-- I'll say it-- a salamander-like creature, begins shouting out phrases in Ignan, which you understand. It says, "Go! He's not here yet! Alleviate this uncontrolled one!" At which point, they all begin to swarm towards you.
Marisha: At which point I'm going to do a fire intimidation tactic. I'm going to do a fire radial thing. And I'm going to say, as the leader of this realm, as the Kaitaki of the Fire Nation, you will heed my word.
Chris hardwick: Quite dramatic, isn't she?
Matt: As you guys are watching this from a distance, all you hear is (guttural noises). It's really confusing and a little hilarious, to be honest.
Laura: I think it's going well.
Matt: I need you to make an intimidation check.
Marisha: No, that one fails me a lot.
Travis: Yeah, sure it fails you.
Matt: What you got, Keyleth?
Marisha: It does! Shut up, Travis. Natural 20!
Travis: Ha. Thought I made a point.
Matt: All right. As this happens, the two smaller elementals shrink down and glance over at the larger one. The larger one looks about and shouts back at you in Ignan, once again: "Do you serve him?"
Marisha: It doesn't matter who I serve, for I am above him. I am your master now. This is not your realm. Get back into the fire plane. Where you came from.
Matt: He looks back at the long snake-like humanoid who's standing there who glances at the other one and goes, "She wants us back. Very well." And they all turn around and begin to slowly drift back towards the center of the Cindergrove where the flickering light was.
Marisha: Holy shit.
Laura: Good job, Keyleth!
Travis: We don't know what happened, why are we clapping?
Laura: They're turning around, they're heading back in that direction!
Marisha: I fly back over to them, still in fire elemental form--
Liam: Whoa whoa whoa!
Marisha: And I'm like  You guys! Did you see that! It was really crazy! Did you see? Did you see? They think I'm their leader! They think I'm their god!
Travis: Is she talking in normal, or is she talking in the (flickering flames).
Matt: (flickering flames)
Travis: Yeah, no idea what you're doing or saying.
Laura: You're very scary right now, dear.
Chris hardwick: Is she going to be sick?
Travis: I think so. I might have to tackle you if you don't calm the fuck down.
Marisha: I chill out. I chill out, I can't revert back, though, guys, because I want to stay in this.
Matt: So the fire elemental is just like (calm whoosh). And it's more of a smoldering sad elemental at the moment.
Marisha: I give them a fire thumbs-up.
Matt: There you go. Strong sad elemental.
Liam: First word. Two syllables.
Travis: So, they're going back. Do we move on?
Laura: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah. I'm going to take off, leading in my fire elemental form, deeper towards the rift. Keeping my eye out for any elementals that might be escaping.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: This is her game.
Travis: Yeah, but it's on fire.
Matt: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.
Laura: What?
Chris hardwick: 18.
Matt: Okay. Vex, make a perception check.
Travis: Roll high.
Laura: Pressure!
Taliesin: Use one of your good dice.
Laura: Perception.
Liam: And roll bad.
Laura: Shut up.
Taliesin: Should've used the good dice.
Laura: 30. No. 28.
Matt: 28?
Sam: Yep! Wait, are you exhausted?
Matt: Yeah, you are.
Laura: On everything?
Matt: Skill check. Roll again.
Laura: No, even better!
Travis: Even better.
Liam: So it's the earlier.
Matt: So it's the earlier one, yeah. Okay. You just see, as you're all just walking along, your new blue dragonborn friend just reaches down and snatches something from the dirt, pockets it and keeps walking.
Laura: I follow behind him and keep watching him. Can I see what it was?
Matt: You have no idea. You just see a little cluster of ash and dust on the ground that's been partially disturbed. All right. As you continue to press forward, you hear in the distance a loud cracking sound echoing, and you can see what appear to be a number of trees in the far-off side to the northeastern side of the forest, as a brief whirlwind flickers up. You assume this is probably from the Fire Ashari, who've taken that side of the entranceway, and you can see two flickering lights drift up in the air before sparking out in the distance.
Travis: Ooh, really?
Laura: Should we let them know we're in place, then?
Marisha: I'll throw up a Skywrite. Or actually, as a fire elemental, can I just be like (fire flares) in fire elemental form?
Matt: I mean, you can make some localized fire happen.
Marisha: Can I send up a little bit like a flare?
Matt: Not in the way you would want to, you'd have to drop form for that and cast a spell.
Marisha: Fuck.
Laura: I'm going to set an arrow on fire and shoot it up in the air.
Marisha: I don't realize she's doing it.
Matt: Okay. As you go ahead and take the arrow-- What do you have around the edge that are going to-- are you just going to light the shaft on fire?
Laura: No, I'm going to tie some of my cloth from-- you know-- that I have-- The thing.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: I take some cloth from the Bag of Holding, from one of those old fancy cloaks that we have.
Travis: Better ask first.
Laura: (sighs) Seriously?! Can I have some of the fancy cloak? Grog, out of the Bag of Holding, please?
Travis: Oh, are you hot right now? It's so weird.
Laura: Jesus Christ. Please.
Travis: Oh, all right. Fancy cloak.
Matt: There you go. The arrow arcs off. Vanishes across the little bit of the remaining treeline.
Laura: No idea if they saw that.
Matt: All right. Do you guys continue to press forward?
Marisha: Hold for a second. And wait for Team Three's response?
Sam: There's a third team?
Marisha: Right, there's a third team. Three teams, right?
Laura: All the other teams already responded. We were the third.
Marisha: Oh! One, two, we were three. Okay, yeah.
Matt: Okay. You begin to push further forward towards the center of the Cindergrove, as you're noticing more and more of these trees are pushed flat. It's almost like that Russian forest the meteor had landed in and exploded; all the trees are flattened--
Chris hardwick: Tunguska.
Matt: Think Tunguska, thank you. Where you begin to climb over a number of these flattened portions of the forest, and in the center you can see that one river of molten rock that had been trickling down the front of the mountain is sourced here in the center, where once previously you guys had performed a ritual to pass into the elemental plane, has now torn into this extremely bright rift that flickers. It's like looking into the sun, you have to avert your gaze; you cannot look directly at it without actually hurting your eyesight. And you can see, there are multiple paths of this molten lava, pouring out from this new volcanic activity. You can see it burbling up and bubbling underneath, like the very presence of this tear itself is causing the activity to just raise and grow more fervent. At the base of the rift, you can see a number of other elemental creatures that are in the process of surrounding this opening-- (door creak)
Matt: -- and you can-- Everything all right, Ryan?
Ryan: I am not here.
Matt: You're not here, okay?
Sam: You don't know.
Matt: I don't know.
Chris hardwick: You guys see him too?
Matt: Perfect. As you can see, all these elemental entities are swirling around. There are two more of these strange, snake-like humans, these salamander-like creatures that are discussing, and one really large one that stands there holding this strange trident-like structure, and it's shouting out commands left and right, and you can see these salamander entities and a number of these elementals are all gathered around the portal, and they're all just focusing this slow, steady beam towards it. And as you can see it tearing, flickering and slowly expanding with each popping expansion of this doorway, the ground itself shifts and rumbles.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark the big one.
Matt: All right.
Chris hardwick: Can I send a candle?
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah.
Chris hardwick: All right, what am I looking at, here? Fire? There's a bit of fire?
Matt: There's a lot of fire. Most of these entities are either fire essence or just made out of straight flame.
Chris hardwick: I'd like to call over the skeleton known as Fatty Arbuckle. I'd like to give Fatty Arbuckle an Ice Storm Candle.
Matt: All right.
Chris hardwick: And ask him to kindly deliver it to the center of this melee that's happening just up ahead.
Sam: Won't that kill your friend?
Chris hardwick: Oh. He's had a good run.
Taliesin: I'm feeling a lot less guilty, suddenly.
Chris hardwick: Well, I can do it! What I don't appreciate is when other people do it.
Sam: That's fair. That's fair.
Chris hardwick: You know, it's my choice. Never said it was okay for you to start lighting them up with arrows. Jesus Christ, whoever that is.
Laura: I'm Vex'ahlia, nice to meet you.
Matt: Fatty Arbuckle, skeletal claws clasped around the side of this marbled-looking, bluish-white candle, and clutches it and just goes (snarl).
Chris hardwick: Yes, off you trot, go!
Sam: You don't have to demean him as he goes.
Taliesin: I was really hoping for a Fatty Arbuckle skeleton impression. I was really, really hoping for it. What you did was cool, but like, that was just my heart.
Chris hardwick: They can't speak. They don't have voice boxes or anything.
Matt: As it shuffles forward, down this ashen pit towards the dome where the lava itself is beginning to pour forth and the doorway is, you can see the shadow of its form as the light passes. It looks like the cover of The Thing, how it's just bright light coursing past this dark image of the skeleton, walking away from you.
Laura: Maybe we should duck down, so that nobody knows where that came from.
Chris hardwick: Oh, yes, get ten feet back, I should've said that already.
Matt: It's walked quite a distance, thankfully, at this point. It's probably a good 40 or 50 feet before it reaches the first salamander. And you see, as it begins to step forward, they all turn and look, and one of them shouts over (snarling). One of them glances over, reaches out and pulls out a long, brass-colored longbow and begins to notch an arrow carefully, as it hobbles forward. They look at each other. One of them shouts out in Ignan, which you understand, Keyleth, shouting, "You! Who walks here?" Just keeps walking forward like a little wind-up toy made of bone. Until eventually, the one with the bow gives a nudge with its head, and the other salamander entity draws a heavy-bladed object and begins to step forward towards it, ready to go ahead and cleave it. As the skeleton steps forward, it gets right at the corner of its range. Do you want to command it?
Marisha: I feel like Helen Hunt in that moment in Twister.
Chris hardwick: Squeeze the candle, Fatty Arbuckle!
Matt: At which point, the skeleton, just as the blade sweeps past and crashes into its torso, shattering the rib cage, the arms go (crack). The wax bends and cracks in the center, and there's a brief pause where nothing seems to happen. And a swirl of sudden, localized storming blizzard just encases a ten-foot radius, hitting both of those salamander creatures. What does it say on the candle specifically?
Chris hardwick: On the Ice Storm Candle. All affected must make a dexterity saving throw, DC 12, or suffer 4d6 cold damage.
Matt: That's a fail and a save. And it's half damage on success?
Chris hardwick: Half damage on success.
Matt: Great. Okay, so one of them failed and one of them saved. So go ahead and roll 4d6 damage.
Travis: Dang. I think that's a good way to start.
Chris hardwick: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh boy. Three, six, nine.
Matt: Nine? Okay, nine and five cold damage to each. So (bang) it blasts open. Oh, and a dexterity check for your buddy, who makes it! So, Fatty Arbuckle actually walks out of there with a mere five points of cold damage.
Laura: Nice, Fatty!
Matt: Out of ice and frost. His busted-open rib cage, though, he did suffer...
Liam: Super duper!
Travis: Putting on the Ritz!
Matt: Did suffer seven damage from the impact of this weapon. So Fatty Arbuckle, pretty damaged, but still standing there just going (snarling).
Chris hardwick: Keep standing, Fatty, you can do it! I love you, Fatty!
Matt: Is everyone just going to sit back at this, or--?
Laura: No, we should probably attack.
Matt: It's up to you. Or you can watch this horrible bludgeoning of this skeleton in the teeth of death.
Travis: When I see the salamander take out the big, shiny sharp thing, I go into a rage.
Laura: I hide.
Matt: All right. Travis, I assume you're going to be rushing in there, then?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Anyone who wishes to immediately go into battle now, let's roll initiative.
Taliesin: All right. I'm in on this.
Matt: All right. Let me go ahead and--
Sam: For Fatty!
Marisha: So these are all fire elementals. Should I continue--
Taliesin: Oh, hell yeah.
Chris hardwick: Ah, nice.
Laura: Should we roll for stealth again, or are we still stealthed?
Chris hardwick: I was just shouting at a skeleton.
Laura: Oh, I know, I was trying to hide, though. Like, back away from you as you were doing that.
Travis: The candle turned into a blizzard, so. Ooh!
Taliesin: Is it a candle, though? It's like a thing, like there's no--
Liam: And I mean, Gern was shouting.
Taliesin: It's a candle the way the wheelie things are hoverboards. I think it's weird.
Chris hardwick: And they also catch on fire. They also explode.
Matt: All right, so this is quite a ways away from the portal itself. Lava flow traveling around that side.
Taliesin: Oh, look at that!
Matt: All right, and we have Keyleth over here as the fire elemental.
Laura: You're at the portal.
Marisha: Huh?
Laura: That's okay. We're all going to die.
Travis: No.
Taliesin: Where's the big one?
Matt: The big one that you haven't seen yet?
Laura: The big one that I Hunter's Marked.
Taliesin: That one. The one holding the tridenty thing.
Matt: Oh, sorry.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: Whoa. Look at how pretty those lava bubbles look!
Sam: Is that Gern?
Matt: That's Gern right there. We have Fatty Arbuckle.
Taliesin: Fatty!
Matt: And chilling over here, we have Coral and Stimpy.
Travis: What is that crater? Is that just a crater?
Liam: I think that's the portal they were trying to--
Sam: So these are fire elementals, yes?
Matt: They seem to be fire-based creatures, yes.
Liam: Hey, DM!
Matt: Yes.
Liam: You said they were ripping open the portal? Where is that on the map?
Matt: It's back, it's this far back.
Liam: Way back, okay.
Travis: That crater's just a crater, though?
Matt: Yeah. There is a pool of magma that goes this way. You guys are on one side of it, and pushing this way further, the rest of the actual portal's back this far. All right. So, initiative order, we have 25 to 20, anyone?
Sam: 22.
Taliesin: 27.
Travis: Fucking Percy. Jesus. Every time. You motherfucker.
Taliesin: I'm fast as fuck.
Matt: Okay. 20 to 15.
Travis: 17.
Chris hardwick: 19.
Liam: 16. Carl!
Matt: All right.
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13. Keyleth?
Marisha: Four.
Matt: All right, great. So, top of the round, Percy, you're up first.
Taliesin: First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my pistol. I'm going to do a trick shot for the arms. Actually, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to-- you know, actually, I'm going to hold off on that. I'm going to make an arm shot to the one with the trident.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: That was my first shot. And that's 25.
Matt: 25 hits.
Taliesin: And that's a strength saving throw.
Matt: Strength saving throw. That is going to be a 20.
Taliesin: That just barely makes it.
Matt: Aw. The blast of your impact (bang) hits the arm. He manages to hold onto his trident-like weapon.
Taliesin: That's fine. He's going to take his damage, and then he's going to take another one of those, because eff that.
Matt: All righty. So go ahead and roll damage on that.
Travis: Because eff that.
Taliesin: That's 13 points of damage.
Matt: 13 points of damage. All righty.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to take another shot.
Matt: Go for it. Scanlan, you're up on deck, by the way, so be ready.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Taliesin: Strength check.
Matt: That's a nine.
Taliesin: He dropped that.
Matt: Failure. (gunshot) You see his fingers are pried off as one of his pinky fingers is actually blown off from the impact, shooting dark, deep crimson blood that seems to burn the landscape around as it drips, the trident tumbling to the ground and getting lodged in a piece of rock, almost ready to spill into part of the lava.
Taliesin: And that does seven points of damage.
Matt: Seven points of damage, all righty.
Taliesin: Third shot's going to be a sharpshooter shot.
Matt: All righty. So minus five to the attack.
Taliesin: That's probably going to miss. 14.
Matt: 14, unfortunately, misses.
Taliesin: All right. That misses. I'm going to take a run behind and hide behind that rock outcropping.
Matt: There? Okay. Got it. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Do I see that big thing in the back?
Matt: This big thing here? Yeah, the fire elemental. You see that.
Sam: Okay. And the thing next to Fatty Arbuckle is also a baddie, yeah? They're all baddies?
Matt: These things are all baddies here.
Sam: All right. I'm going to take 15 feet, step to my right to put me in a straight line with the guy next to Fatty and the big guy behind him. And then fire a Lightning Bolt straight ahead to hit both of them. I hope they're not immune to lightning. We'll find out.
Matt: All righty. So, and you watch out of the corner as well, Gern, you see this tiny little gnome step to the side, conjure some arcane purplish-blue energy, and then thrust his pelvis forward as a bolt of lightning energy just rockets forth, tearing--
Sam: From my penis.
Chris hardwick: Nice. Of course.
Sam: Just felt like I had to make that clear.
Chris hardwick: Oh, I don't think I've ever seen that happen before.
Taliesin: We have.
Laura: So many times.
Chris hardwick: Have to get that looked at.
Matt: Slamming both into the larger salamander creature and the elemental behind it. Go ahead and roll 8d6 damage. What's the DC on this?
Sam: Is it my spell save DC?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: With the hand-cone?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: 20.
Matt: Ooh! That is a failure and a failure!
Travis: Yes!
Matt: All right. So full damage against both.
Sam: 27.
Matt: Oof. All righty. As the bolt of lightning energy tears through both of them, eventually absorbed into the stone behind them, the elemental flame form flickers and falls to the ground for a second, trying to reform itself, while the salamander looks down at this blackened, burned char mark in the center of its torso from where the bolt entered and exited out of its back to strike its compadre. Not too happy, and confused how such a large, damaging thing came from such a small little creature.
Sam: It's powerful. Then I'll turn to our new friend Gern, and I will inspire him. I'll say, please, help us, and to inspire you I will sing you a song. And I will sing--
Chris hardwick: Pretty inspired by your dick lightning, to be honest.
Sam: Oh, there's more.
Chris hardwick: You think a song's going to get better than that?
Sam: It might! It might. And so I sing (singing) To everything, Gern, Gern, Gern. There is a season, Gern, Gern, Gern. I just like to sing your name, Gern Blanston. Did that help?
Chris hardwick: Do I have to roll to determine if that was helpful or not?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Chris hardwick: Certainly.
Matt: Roll a d20 for musical taste.
Chris hardwick: Four.
Matt: Four. It catches you by the ear with delight.
Chris hardwick: It's not bad, actually. It's not bad.
Matt: Your general frustration with modern music is completely bisected by the more oldies, classical sound of his tune.
Chris hardwick: I quite enjoyed how you worked my first name into that, actually. No one's ever done that before.
Matt: So you get a d10 inspiration dice.
Chris hardwick: All right.
Matt: So just keep that on the side. If ever you make an attack roll or a saving throw that isn't as high as you want it to be, you can then roll that and add the d10 to that roll.
Chris hardwick: Okay, great.
Matt: So you just have that in the wings, as you feel inspired.
Taliesin: We'll try and remind you if something affects it.
Chris hardwick: Thank you very much. Excellent.
Matt: All right. That brings it to the elementals' turn. Now, this flame elemental is going to streak over (whoosh) to Blern who's-- or, no, sorry, this is to Fatty Arbuckle. There's too many weird names tonight. And this larger fire elemental here is going to--
Chris hardwick: Oh, Fatty. He served me well.
Sam: I don't know, he's got a fighting chance. I love that we were scrambling for d6's when we have this right in front of us.
Chris hardwick: Are there any dice around anywhere?
Sam: Where are we going to find...?
Taliesin: I'm just waiting for the hand to go in and just--
Chris hardwick: I found this polyhedral vase and I had to fill it with nine pounds of dice.
Travis: He went the long way.
Matt: He's not doing anything, he used his whole round to get there.
Travis: Oh, okay.
Matt: But now, as the larger elemental burns into the center of Scanlan, Percy, you can feel, just his presence itself is extremely, dangerously hot. The air around you is blistering. You can feel your hair curl back in its presence. The small elemental is going to go ahead and make two attacks against Fatty Arbuckle.
Chris hardwick: Ah, shite.
Matt: That's going to be a nine to hit. I think his AC's 13, so I don't think it's going to hit, yeah. Second one rolls a one.
Sam: Fatty lives!
Travis: Fatty just don't want to die.
Taliesin: Can't keep Fatty down.
Liam: Bob and weave, Fatty, bob and weave!
Chris hardwick: Don't step too hard, Fatty! You won't be able to take it!
Matt: And with that, Grog, it's your turn. So you go into your rage at the top of your turn, and then what would you like to do?
Travis: Can I use, I guess, my entire action to run towards Scanlan?
Matt: What's your speed again?
Travis: 50.
Matt: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. You can get right there between Scanlan and this creature if you want to.
Travis: That's about it, huh?
Matt: I'd say that's your movement. You can move ten more feet if you want to.
Sam: You can leap over me.
Travis: Nah, we need to spread out. Can I go back and arc the other way? Can I run to the left as far as I can?
Matt: This way?
Travis: No, from where my starting point was.
Matt: Oh, you mean like this way instead?
Travis: Yeah. Yeah, back towards you, around the pool.
Matt: That's about as far as you can get, right there. If you do not attack anything, you would lose your rage.
Travis: I fall out of my rage, yeah. So I fall out of it. Can I throw something? I guess I can, yeah.
Matt: You can throw your weapon if you want to.
Travis: Can I attach the Chain of Returning to Craven Edge? And I'll throw it at trident-less bastard right there, yeah.
Matt: Go for it. So you watch as this muscle-bound goliath comes leaping around the corner as it affixes a chain to the edge of its weapon, flinging a two-handed sword like a giant boomerang and--
Travis: Only 14.
Matt: 14, against the larger one?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Unfortunately, it makes an impact, but it just ricochets off of its plated body armor, and then tumbles to the ground. You can go ahead and make your--
Travis: Thing to pull it back. Strength. 18.
Matt: Okay, no problem. You pull it back with the chain and catch it mid-air. Ending your turn there?
Travis: Keeping my rage.
Matt: Indeed. Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, so I rev up the Boots of Haste and I'm going to run right next to Vex'ahlia, on the very edge of the map. And the fire elemental there's right up against Percy, right?
Matt: Yep.
Liam: All right. I'm going to stab him three times in his fire buttocks. First one is a 27.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Second one is a 16.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Third is a 14.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Hits, okay. So, first one's sneak attack, so, shite. An eight-- I'll add that on at the end. Here come the dice. Two, four, seven, ten, 16, 21, 27, 28. 28 plus two is 30, 36, for that first with sneak attack damage.
Matt: Oof! His form flickers briefly for a moment from the sheer impact of the dagger hit.
Liam: Second dagger does seven, and third swipe does nine.
Matt: Nine. All righty. The two other daggers impact, partially passing through its form, not quite as impactful as the first. That first one did seemingly cause the creature to have a hard time coalescing its fire-wreathed physicality. That ends your turn, Vax?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Gern, you're up. So you're right there.
Chris hardwick: I'm right there. How far can I run and cast a spell at the ones around Fatty?
Matt: 30 feet is how far you can run, and that's about six squares.
Chris hardwick: If I were to cast a bit of-- how about a Cone of Cold, could I cast a Cone of Cold at the fire elementals?
Matt: You could, you could very much so.
Liam: That sounds delightful.
Chris hardwick: I could cast Ice Storm, but that's a general malaise of middle-aged couples living in a neighborhood, becoming aware of their dead-end lives.
Matt: All right, so you want to move around here?
Chris hardwick: Yes, let's move around that bit right there. And I'd like to cast Cone of Cold. I might unfortunately have to take out Fatty, but--
Matt: Yeah, there's probably a good chance, this is not going to be-- After everything else Fatty's survived, his own master deals him the possible finishing blow.
Chris hardwick: I feel like I should be the one to do it.
Sam: Of course.
Chris hardwick: It's much more humane.
Sam: It's poetic.
Chris hardwick: I think so.
Marisha: You brought him into this world.
Chris hardwick: This is what Fatty would've wanted.
Matt: Everything under that area gets affected. So yeah, you could do that.
Chris hardwick: Yeah, don't worry about it. It's fine. No big thing. This old spell? I mean.
Liam: Y'all want to go to the DQ and get a cone of cold?
Matt: What's your spell DC? It should be at the top of your spell page.
Chris hardwick: It is 16.
Matt: 16, all right. And it is a constitution save, let's see if they make it. That is a failure, a failure, and a failure.
Sam: What about Fatty, did he succeed?
Matt: Oh, I'll roll for Fatty. Fatty does not succeed. Nope.
Laura: It was inevitable.
Matt: Nope. All right, go ahead and roll 8d8 points of cold damage.
Sam: Jeez. Oh man, these are not used a lot.
Chris hardwick: I have four. Let's see, I have a whole-- there's another one here... They're not that easy to get to. Two, four, six. I need two more.
Sam: Two more? Good gravy.
Chris hardwick: Is this one?
Sam: Yep.
Chris hardwick: Here's one, and... D'oh!
Laura: This is why I sort my dice at the beginning of the game...
Chris hardwick: Sorry, it sounded like there was something coming from the other side of the room.
Sam: Taliesin, you don't have a d8?
Chris hardwick: Do you have a d8 I can borrow?
Taliesin: I actually don't. I don't know what happened to my d8's. I'll buy some at the convention tomorrow.
Laura: Yay!
Matt: By the way, guys, if we hit 16k before the end of tonight's show, we're going to go ahead and have a sloth come into the studio.
Laura: What?!
Matt: 16K and a sloth!
Marisha: 16K and a sloth!
Marisha: I know! I know!
Laura: When? When?
Travis: What?
Sam: An actual sloth?
Liam: Is it going to play with us?
Laura: Can we hold it?
Travis: Focus, focus.
Chris hardwick: Seven, 14, 21, 27, 31, 34, 38, 44!
All: Oh!
Matt: 44, all...
Laura: (mocking Gern's accent) Farty-far pints o' cald damage!
Chris hardwick: I don't think I appreciate that very fucking much! I'm saving all your fucking arses out here! For crumb's sake!
Matt: As he's shouting out at you, releasing this amazing, condensed blast of pure winter hell in front of him, it comes scattering across this way, freezing the corner of this, turning partially some of the lava here to stone just by proximity, blasts past these entities, and as the arcane snow comes to rest, you can see the fire elemental here itself is having a hard time keeping itself together. Its flame is (whoosh) sputtering and flickering, barely keeping itself together. However, by its side you see three very still frozen-solid statuettes of the remnants of the two salamanders and Fatty Arbuckle. Taken by the cold of winter.
Marisha: Oh, shit. That was awesome.
Sam: Maybe you can reanimate him.
Chris hardwick: It's too late. He's no good any longer.
Sam: Freezer burn?
Chris hardwick: Move on. I have.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of remembering that, too, put a couple of: frozen, frozen, and frozen.
Chris hardwick: (singing) Let it go, let it go.
Matt: All right. I believe that ends your turn, Gern? All right. It would be the salamanders' turn, but they're frozen. Damn, they got pummeled. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Awesome. Wait, so they can unfreeze? Or are they basically frozen until something--
Matt: You don't know.
Laura: (groans) Okay. That yellow one behind me, that's Keyleth, right?
Matt: You believe so.
Laura: Okay. I know, right? I'm going to flip backwards like ten feet.
Matt: All right, right behind it.
Laura: I don't want to be around anybody else, so I'm going to flip over the lava pit and go out there.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Oh, don't burn your foot. Ooh!
Laura: That would be 38.
Matt: Without issue, you land-- not even, no. Two-point landing, on your feet, knee down, still clutching your ready-to-go bow, unscathed by the boiling cauldron of molten rock.
Laura: And I Hunter's Mark the guy attacking near Percy and Scanlan and I shoot two arrows into him.
Matt: Okay, right there. Go for it. Two attacks.
Laura: Ugh. Where is my thing? Hold on, sorry. (giggles)
Matt: You're on deck, Keyleth.
Laura: 21?
Matt: 21 hits.
Laura: And 17.
Matt: Both hit.
Travis: That's nice.
Laura: 17 on the first hit.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And then 18 on the second hit.
Matt: Nice! Both arrows burn to ash when they impact, but the sheer blow and the magical energy behind it from the bow that you threw it from hit it and you can see it begin to shake its form even more, itself. Did you do the Hunter's Mark damage as well?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, good. Cool. That end your turn, Vex?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Work with me here.
Matt: Okay. All right, whatcha got, whatcha got?
Marisha: So here's what I want to do. I want to go low and dive into that lava pit in front of me.
Sam: Ooh! Sounds scary.
Marisha: And I want to-- using the lava around me to rise out of the lava and look really scary and badass, and then I'm going to shout to the living elementals, I'm going to be like, hear my warning! I am your new master! Retreat to the Fire Plane or meet your imminent demise! This is your last chance.
Sam: Pretty good. Pretty good.
Taliesin: Way better than last time.
Marisha: Thanks! Thanks, guys. And if you'd like to meet for coffee later I might be available.
Matt: I'll say, given the use of lava control in this, they are still elementals, go ahead and make a persuasion check. No, intimidate, this would be intimidate.
Marisha: Okay. Okay. That's better than my persuasion. Let's do this one, that one rolled a one. Get out of here. Get out of here. 15?
Matt: 15? You can see the smaller elemental here that just watched its friends get frozen solid, as well as whatever that skeleton was, turns towards you, and (snarls) and begins to make its way this direction.
Marisha: Away? That's cool.
Travis: Towards the portal.
Matt: Yeah. The large one doesn't seem prominently fazed by your display.
Marisha: Okay. But that one's peacing out? Do I still have an action?
Matt: I would say that whole thing of bringing up the molten rock and the shout and everything would be your action.
Taliesin: You knocked one off the plank, Keyleth.
Marisha: I knocked one off the plank.
Matt: There you go. All right, ends your turn, Keyleth, brings us to Percy.
Taliesin: I'm toe to toe with that one right there, aren't I?
Matt: Yeah, it's right up in your space.
Taliesin: It's in my space. Okay. I'm going to draw my sword, I'm going to try to do a back and forth. Let's see how this goes.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: I'm going to take a swipe at it with my sword.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: That's a 30. That hits.
Matt: That hits. You take nine points of fire damage, as just striking it, the flames burst back and burn towards your face and torso from the impact.
Marisha: Did I put fire resist on you? At the end of last game?
Taliesin: Yes, you did! I have fire resist on me.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So you take half damage.
Taliesin: So that's how much? How much fire damage?
Matt: That would be four. Four damage.
Taliesin: Four damage? Four damage. Four.
Matt: All right. And roll damage for your strike.
Taliesin: Ooh! 15 points of damage.
Matt: Hmm! All right. Do you want to make a second attack, you said? Or are you just going to keep going back and forth, what's your plan? Whatcha doing? Whatcha doing, Percy?
Taliesin: He's being a dick. I'm going to try and break away and back up, I'm going to try and roll away from him to be on the other side of the rock.
Matt: Okay. As you roll away, it's going to take an attack of opportunity at you. That is an 18 to hit?
Taliesin: My armor class is 18, but I'm going to use my shield for plus five to my AC, so that won't hit.
Matt: Okay, so you use your shield brooch, okay. As it strikes out towards you, streaking its elemental claws outward, you back away, instilling the power of the brooch, and you see an arcane shield temporarily ricochets, pushing its claw away from you. You run away unharmed to the other side of the rock.
Taliesin: Instead of going to the other side of the rock, I'm going to run straight back, and I'm just going to shoot at it as I run away. I'm going to make two more shots at it.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm going to take one more shot, because I have to reload. That's a 15.
Matt: 15 hits.
Taliesin: Wow! Holy cow.
Matt: Elementals aren't very hard to hit.
Taliesin: No, that was amazing. That's ten points of damage. And then I reload.
Matt: All right, and you reload. All right, that ends Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Who's behind me back there, way at the edge of the map?
Matt: Over there?
Laura: That's Vax.
Sam: That's Vax? Oh, he'll be fine. Okay, I don't want to be near this thing, probably. Right?
Matt: That's your call.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to take a step towards Vax.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And away from Gern, right? So is Gern 15 feet away from me yet, so far?
Matt: He's 15 feet from you, yeah.
Sam: Okay. So I will then cast Thunderwave, which should not hit Gern, but will hit Vax.
Matt: Is that a 15-foot radius?
Sam: It's a 15-foot cube.
Matt: Cube, so you can just make the cube here, and it'll hit none of them.
Sam: Oh! Oh, great. I'll do that. And I'll do it at level two. Thunderwave.
Matt: All right, level two Thunderwave. Coming on up. Oh, it's a self. A 15-foot cube originating from you, so yeah, so you can hit that guy.
Sam: Yeah, originating from me.
Matt: All right, cool. So, level three, that's 3d8, let's see if it makes its constitution saving throw. It does not, not with a natural seven. So go ahead and roll your damage, 3d8 thunder damage.
Sam: Not very much -- Ooh! That's pretty good. 20.
Marisha: Nice!
Matt: 20! How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Scanlan Shorthalt!
Sam: I send the Thunderwave out by cracking my knuckles, and as I do so, I do: ahem, Gern, might want to check this out.
Chris hardwick: Oh, I'm looking at something over here.
Sam: Gern!
Chris hardwick: I'll be with you in just a minute, I'm dealing with something.
Sam: Gern, I'm doing something really cool here.
Chris hardwick: I'll be with you in just a minute.
Sam: Fuck. So I do it anyway but with a scowl on my face.
Chris hardwick: All right, what did I miss?
Sam: Fuck!
Chris hardwick: Oh, I was just, why didn't you wait? I just said a minute.
Sam: Oh, forget it, you had to be there.
Chris hardwick: All right. I was here, but you didn't-- you should've told me.
Matt: You even missed your own Thunderwave spell, you were so distracted with your frustration. You look back, you cracked your knuckles, and it's gone, but you didn't see it happen and it's a little disappointing overall.
Sam: I kick the dirt.
Matt: All right. You guys look over as this elemental runs off towards the glowing doorway you see further down this passage. It's not that far away from you, but you do see the flickering doorway that's like (sputtering). You can see other entities beginning to step out of it, and you can see one larger form. It looks fiery, humanoid, just (crackling) comes out, lower body made of ash and cinders.
Marisha: I rush that way and look for my other tribe. Can I see any of my other tribemates?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: You're running at them.
Travis: So if they're frozen, does that mean they're dead?
Matt: You can go find out.
Laura: They'll probably melt eventually.
Travis: Yeah, can I walk over there close to them?
Marisha: That's better. That one keeps fucking me. What'd you say? Perception?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: 26.
Matt: 26. Currently, from where you stand--
Marisha: No, sorry, sorry. 24.
Matt: 24. From where you stand, you can look off in the distance, you can see parts of the treeline across, down the Cindergrove, shifting and moving, and you hear the distant sounds of combat, but you do not have a visual perspective. It looks like the other teams have not quite made their way to the center. You're actually the first team to get here. And you made your way around a possible encounter, and in doing so, arrived before the other teams did. However, it looks like a secondary line of defense is now pouring out of this doorway.
Laura: Oh shit.
Travis: Can I make my way to the two frozen statue-types?
Matt: There's three statues, actually.
Travis: Or three of 'em, yeah.
Matt: Including Fatty Arbuckle.
Travis: Fatty Arbuckle. Can I make my way over to one of them and-- should I just make sure they're dead?
Laura: Yeah, just push 'em over, smash them.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, can I push Trident-dick over?
Matt: Yeah. As you shove-- and it's a pretty heavy form, especially with the ice that's, you know, formed around the body--
Travis: Come on.
Matt: --but not too hard for you, Grog, because you're Grog. You give a little shove, and as it topples over, it just shatters into 100 pieces.
Travis: Ooh, like the T-1000.
Liam: What?
Travis: Yeah, I dunno.
Laura: Do the other one now.
Travis: Oh yeah, can I go over and do the other one, like, (giggles).
Matt: Yeah. This time, you give this one a full push, this one actually gets about ten feet in the air.
Marisha: Cow-tipper!
Matt: Before scattering across the ground, pieces of it actually spilling into the molten lava. And there stands, frozen in place, Fatty Arbuckle, chest destroyed, arm limp to the side, just--
Travis: Can I pick him up and walk him back over to Gern and go: sorry.
Matt: You see the half-giant goliath handing you the frozen body of your skeletal friend.
Chris hardwick: Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this, now.
Travis: You don't want him?
Chris hardwick: I mean, he's not very-- maybe we could have a quick burial.
Laura: You could hang a coat on him.
Chris hardwick: So we basically would just carry him around as a coat-rack.
Liam: Don't we have company incoming?
Laura: We have a Bag of Holding. Oh, there's a giant monster. I Hunter's Mark it. Is it close by?
Matt: We'll get to that as soon as we come back from this break. We're going to take a quick bathroom break and we'll see you guys back here in about ten minutes or so to continue this next step in the adventure. [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role. Last we left off, the party was making their way towards the center of the caldera where the portal torn open to the fire elemental plane resides over a flow of molten rock pouring in three directions from the center of the mountain. Seeing a number of entities swirling around, and some pouring forth from this open doorway, Vox Machina and their current temporary ally by the traveling dragonborn wizard/necromancer/candlemaker named Gern Blanston have made their way in this direction. Now, before we start, just to remind you guys, I guess we're getting pretty close to 16k subscribers, and when we hit 16k something with a sloth is going to happen.
Laura: Not tonight, though.
Matt: No, not, I don't think tonight.
Sam: We have a sloth on standby.
Matt: There will be a sloth apparently that will come here for 16k and a sloth. And if you want to watch Laura freak out--
Laura: Ah, so much!
Matt: Also, we have a giveaway winner for the evening; ToastKingJr is the winner of tonight's Critical Role giveaway, congratulations. Well done, you, we'll be sending you a lot of fun goodies your way very shortly, so--
Chris hardwick: Our regards to ToastKing senior.
Matt: Oh yes; well, you've made him proud. Make sure to let him know. We'll give him a little a little pipe or something inside too, it'll be good. All right, so you guys gather yourselves, stepping through the battlefield you had just encountered, the shattered and slowly melting pieces of ice that once were some of these fire elemental denizens scattered around your feet, you step forward as you see the somewhat human, somewhat flame-based entity come pouring out of the void, surrounded by other elementals, and one of the other standing salamander general-type individuals. You can see--
Marisha: This is coming out of the rift?
Matt: Yes, coming out of the rift.
Laura: Is that behind him, is that what the--
Matt: This is the actual doorway right there.
Marisha: Oh, and so this is a pool of lava that they're coming out of?
Matt: Yes, this is all molten--
Marisha: Molten fire plane, more or less?
Matt: Well, this is actual lava from the inside of the mountain that has been called forth and cracked through the surface, because of the presence of the tear.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Chris hardwick: Probably fine.
Travis: Probably. I don't think this will be bad
Taliesin: We did not take a short rest, did we?
Matt: No, you did not.
Taliesin: There has been no time.
Marisha: I'm going to, and upon seeing this, drop my fire elemental form and I say: oh shit, I have a feeling this is the 'him' they were talking about. And I have a feeling he's not going to believe that I'm the real new master. So there's that.
Laura: So do some cold stuff, like this guy.
Matt: I'd like you all to make a stealth check, by the way, as this is transpiring, and these entities are now making--
Laura: Pass Without a Trace? Is that still in effect?
Matt: No, you cast Hunter's Mark, so the concentration on that ended, unfortunately, sorry.
Chris hardwick: 14.
Sam: 15.
Taliesin: 13.
Sam: Oh wait, with Pass Without a Trace?
Marisha: No.
Laura: No.
Marisha: 24.
Liam: 34.
Laura: 22.
Travis: 20.
Matt: As you guys are all having this conversation, hushed behind this barricade of broken tree elements, you can see this salamander general turn and hiss in that direction, look over, and point his trident in the direction of where you all are. You can see the larger fire elementals all of a sudden turn their attention in the direction of the party, as the humanoid floating about five feet off the ground, his lower form just this swirl of cinders and black ash, chuckles with his arms crossed. Points forward, and the elementals begin moving forward.
Marisha: Can Keyleth do a quick ancillary action before shit happens?
Matt: Well, this would be the initiative order now, so everyone roll initiative.
Liam: Maybe they see something behind us.
Travis: Fuck!
Marisha: Jesus, sucking it up today.
Matt: All right, folks, this brings us to 25 to 20?
Liam: 20.
Sam: Hey!
Travis: Jude.
Chris hardwick: Don't make it bad.
Taliesin: (singing) Take a bad roll...
Matt: 20 to 15?
Laura: 19.
Chris hardwick: Yes, I'm 16.
Matt: 16 for Gern.
Liam: ErmahGern!
Matt: 15 to ten?
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: 13 for Percy. Ten to five?
Travis: Eight.
Matt: Eight for Grog. Scanlan, what's your--
Sam: Oh, ten, sorry, ten, ten.
Matt: So that would be just below you, Percy. All righty. I believe that's all on that end there. And that brings us to--
Marisha: I'm seven, by the way.
Matt: Oh, seven, thought I got you.
Laura: Nobody cares, Marisha.
Marisha: I know, I'll just... be back here... caboose.
Matt: There we go. So right before Grog is Keyleth. Great. All right. Top of the combat round.
Marisha: Yeah, nope. Not leading.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Shitty initiative roll.
Sam: It's going to be fine.
Taliesin: He's cut things out of cardboard. This doesn't look fun.
Marisha: There was planning. There was a thought process.
Travis: Oh shit, towers.
Taliesin: There was an instructables involved in this. This is just really-- we're doomed.
Travis: No, no, he was down in the play zone before!
Matt: Tell me who wants to roll an arcana check as you see this entity rising up--
Travis: Oh, absolutely.
Sam: I will, as well.
Matt: For people who are proficient with it.
Travis: Two.
Sam: Oh, with disadvantage, right?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Liam: So tired.
Chris hardwick: 24.
Travis: Whoa! Get out of here, dragonborn!
Sam: Look at the big brain on Gern.
Chris hardwick: I'm very smart.
Matt: (laughs) And as you say that, you recognize this entity and blurt out its name, just instinctually as you get a proper view of it. One of the many denizens of the fire elemental plane, this is an efreeti, it is a fire genie.
Sam: A nefreeti?
Matt: Efreeti. Yes, the species is efreeti, but an ee-frit, ee-freet, however you want to pronounce it, a flame genie, generally hailing from the City of Brass and/or spaces around and in the fire elemental plane.
Taliesin: I could feel it from that side.
Liam: I was thinking it.
Taliesin: Yeah, I know, I could feel it.
Matt: Floats above all of you, arms still crossed, opens its arms and as it chuckles, both hands just are engulfed in flames that congeal into these large fiery balls as it flings them both down in the direction of the party.
Travis: Feel like we're in MegaMan. A MegaMan boss.
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah!
Matt: This is going to be at Scanlan and Vex.
Laura: What?!
Sam: These are Fireballs, right?
Matt: To Scanlan, that is 13?
Sam: No way.
Matt: Vex, that is 15.
Laura: No!
Matt: Both just (fireball impacts), cracking into the ground to the sides of where you're standing, barely missing them. It keeps glaring down at the rest of you with a smile. Ending that, it brings us to Vax. You're up.
Liam: I got a high stealth right beforehand, so am I hidden at the moment?
Matt: As far as you know, depending on the individual. You don't know who saw you and who didn't.
Liam: As far as I know. All right. Balls. I'm just going to throw three daggers at the salamander, right from where I am.
Matt: Right from where you are? All right.
Liam: Yeah, okay, so. First is a 20, second is a 14, third is a 19.
Matt: Okay. The first one was what?
Liam: 20.
Matt: The first and the third hit. If you are hidden, though, which you would technically be hidden from this individual, you do have advantage on those attacks, so you can reroll the--
Liam: And if I'm hidden it's a surprise, right? On that guy? You tell me.
Matt: No, no, it's a sneak attack if you're hidden. A surprise round is if they have no idea that you're there.
Liam: Okay, I thought it was a-- okay, great! Fine. Love it. Okay, so.
Laura: You have advantage, so maybe one of those would be a 20 if you rerolled them with their advantages.
Liam: All right. No, and other one, no. So, four, eight, 12, 13, 16, 20, 31, 35 for the first. And the second one is a ten.
Travis: Kick us off strong!
Matt: Not bad! Flinging both daggers, one strikes it square in the sternum and the blade cracks and pops as it hits the center of the chest. It (gurgle), you know, it can't make any sound as it disappears from the wound, returning to your belt. The second dagger manages to come towards, it tries to parry out of the air, but in doing so just gets it embedded in its forearm and it shrieks out in pain, as that too vanishes and appears once again in your belt. Are you going to move, or stay where you are?
Liam: I'm going to move. I'm going to skip to my right and stand behind Grog and spank him on the ass and say: go get 'em, tiger.
Matt: "Go get 'em, tiger." Right there. All righty.
Travis: My name's Grog.
Matt: Vex, you're up.
Laura: Are those trees, do they have any substance at all, or are they just there to look pretty?
Matt: I mean, you could get behind them if you want to, they're maybe about that wide.
Liam: They're like Charlie Brown Christmas trees?
Matt: Practically. As far as the Cindergrove's concerned, they're pretty sad-looking. A lot of them have been destroyed and torn and pushed down around.
Laura: All right. I'm going to try to use one as protection. I'm going to hop behind the one over this way.
Matt: This way, here?
Laura: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark the efreeti.
Matt: All righty. Mark the efreeti.
Laura: And then I'm going to use my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to shoot him three times!
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: That first one probably does not succeed. It is a 16.
Matt: That does not hit, nope.
Laura: What about 23?
Matt: That does hit.
Laura: All right. How about... mega miss. So one of those hits, because I'm a loser.
Matt: Streaking past, and the third one hits as he's holding the flame balls in his hands. Seeing the small impact, he just glares at you though the impact.
Travis: You need to sacrifice a small mammal. Maybe we can find a squirrel or something.
Laura: 11.
Travis: A pagan ritual.
Taliesin: I can hook you up. I have a kit.
Travis: (laughter) Why am I not surprised?
Laura: 17 points of damage and that's it because I suck.
Matt: 17 points of damage. And you are hiding behind the tree?
Laura: I am hiding behind the tree.
Matt: That's the end of Vex's turn. It is now the elementals' turns.
Laura: These piece-of-shit dice.
Matt: This is going to move in and actually consumes the space of Gern and his followers.
Taliesin: That's not even a figurine, it's just a chunk of plastic.
Matt: So as you're sitting there, you just see this fire elemental just streak around real fast and all of a sudden step into the space where you and your two undead followers are, flames whirling around you. All of you immediately take five points of fire damage, you and your two allies. Stimpy and Coral, poor guys.
Chris hardwick: Weren't there-- oh, they killed one, that's right, and you guys fucking killed one, too.
Matt: With that, it's going to make two strikes towards you, Gern. The fire elemental rushes in and just (slithering fire noises).
Chris hardwick: Not the vest, not the vest!
Matt: That is going to be a 13 to hit. What's your armor class?
Chris hardwick: 13.
Matt: Just hits you. And that's a natural 20. (sighs and groans)
Matt: So you take 14 points of fire damage from the first one.
Chris hardwick: Doesn't feel very natural.
Liam: Thanks for coming, thanks for playing.
Matt: 19 points of fire damage from the second strike. And you are currently engulfed in flame. You caught fire from the impact with the fire elemental.
Chris hardwick: It doesn't hurt, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm part dragon.
Laura: Do dragonborn have natural fire resistance?
Matt: Certain ones do, not blue ones.
Laura: Oh no!
Chris hardwick: If it was lightning, it'd be fine. But no.
Matt: That ends that elemental's turn. This one is going to step into the space where both Percy and Scanlan are. Both of you guys immediately suffer seven points of fire damage.
Taliesin: I'm halved because I have resistance.
Matt: Correct, so you'd take three points. And it's going to make a strike on each of you. That's going to be a 14 versus you, Scanlan.
Sam: That does not hit me.
Matt: And then versus Percy. Same roll. 14.
Taliesin: (laughter) Ah, you're adorable.
Matt: Misses you both with a series of terrible attacks. That ends their turn. Gern, you're up. At the start of your turn--
Chris hardwick: It's my turn.
Taliesin: But first you have to take your fire damage.
Chris hardwick: Oh, I'm still on fire.
Matt: Yep. At the top of your turn, because you're now on fire, you take six points of fire damage. You're just wreathed in fire, all around. It's a bad, bad Sunday for Gern.
Chris hardwick: Oh boy. I'm trying to find something that won't destroy-- How close is everyone to me? Everyone's pretty close.
Sam: No one's near the big guy.
Chris hardwick: No, but I'm standing right there.
Taliesin: Here, you can see it right here. You're that little red ring right there, and then your two followers are right there. If you have anything that goes in a cube, you'd be fine. Do you have anything that's a cube shot?
Chris hardwick: And which way am I facing?
Taliesin: Whichever way you want to be facing.
Chris hardwick: I mean, I guess-- I'd like to run around and throw another Cone of Cold aimed at that guy, and then up at the prick hovering above everyone.
Matt: This direction, you mean?
Chris hardwick: Yes. Aye!
Matt: So you can move around to this side of the elemental, pushing past your allies, whip around, you get a little bit of a view through the fire and flames swirling around you. You concentrate and release a burst of cold energy. It might not be close enough.
Chris hardwick: Of course it is!
Matt: It'll be enough to get those two there.
Chris hardwick: All right, well, I suppose that's better than nothing at all.
Sam: That's impressive.
Matt: It's better than nothing. All right, so constitution saves on the elemental. What's your DC?
Chris hardwick: 16.
Matt: 16. It fails. On the salamander, that's another big fail with a 13. So go ahead and roll 8d8 damage.
Chris hardwick: (counting) 40. I'm sorry. What was that last one? Shit. 35.
Matt: Nice, 35 points of cold damage to both the salamander and the elemental in front of you. Great. So you see as a blast of winter arcane energy just skirts forward, casting most of the dark area here in snow and ice and sleet. You can see the front of this lava pond is cooled for the moment and actually can be walked across probably for one or two more rounds.
Chris hardwick: You're welcome.
Liam: You're still on fire, by the way.
Matt: Yes, you are also still on fire. Someone has to take an action to try and douse the flames on him, whether it be himself or possibly your allies. You can still give actions to your two undead buddies.
Chris hardwick: Oh. In that case. I think I'd like to ask the zombie character, who I believe was-- no, Stimpy was the skeleton, this is Coral. I'd like to have Coral rip-- is my skin on fire, or is it just my vest?
Matt: Both, actually. The scales are starting to crisp.
Chris hardwick: Those are really hard to get!
Sam: The vest?
Chris hardwick: Yes!
Taliesin: You could just have them swat you. Like (zombie grunting noises).
Chris hardwick: I need to have the zombie hurl its body on top of me, onto the ground, and roll around on me, to get the flame off. It's a very stinky enterprise.
Matt: Okay, I'll allow this. You're intentionally going prone, so you start your next combat round on the ground, which means you'll have half your movement. As Stimpy hobbles over (zombie groan).
Sam: This is Coral.
Chris hardwick: Is there like snow or ice on the ground?
Matt: There is behind the elemental, yes.
Chris hardwick: Can he scoop some up?
Matt: The zombie can take one action, unfortunately, it's not a super intelligent creature. One or the other.
Chris hardwick: All right, then, I suppose he just has to roll on top of me.
Matt: You guys glance over out of the corner of your eye and you see is the dragonborn all of a sudden jumps to the ground, sprawled out, snow angel style.
Chris hardwick: Do it! Just do it already! What are you waiting for?!
Matt: As this undead begins flailing about on top of his body. You're starting to get elements of decaying goo and--
Chris hardwick: Yes, it's fucking terrible!
Matt: But the flames do eventually go out, over the next five to six seconds or so. What would you like Stimpy to do?
Chris hardwick: I mean, I guess-- I would have to give him a candle, wouldn't I?
Matt: You would, yes.
Chris hardwick: Right. Maybe he just scoops up as much ice and snow as possible, and attacks the--
Matt: Sure.
Sam: Snowball fight?
Chris hardwick: Snowball fight.
Matt: He picks up some of the frost on the ground with his skeletal hands. Flings it. Funnily enough, it hits.
Chris hardwick: Fuck yeah, it does.
Matt: Because it's right there. We'll say for that particular instance, it takes--
Chris hardwick: What, like a hundred points of damage?
Matt: Three points of cold damage. (cheers)
Matt: Immediate steam, in the face of a fire elemental.
Chris hardwick: I smell like cooked cow anus at the moment.
Matt: Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Weird question, what saving throw does a creature have to make with your sword?
Travis: Wisdom.
Taliesin: It's a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: No, it's constitution.
Taliesin: Constitution saving throw. Good to know.
Travis: I just answered the first thing that popped into my head.
Taliesin: That was wisdom, fascinating. Okay, I'm right in the thick of it, aren't it?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: I'm going to break away, I'll take the hit. I don't like attacking these things straight on.
Matt: At the top of your turn, by the way, you take nine points of fire damage, down to four, because you are also engulfed in flame, as is Scanlan for having passed over the space there.
Taliesin: Nine points of fire damage, down to four. Okay. I'm going to break away and take a run for it towards that crater in the far right corner.
Matt: This way here?
Taliesin: Thank you, yes.
Matt: Running past the fire elemental, it does get an attack of opportunity on you, swinging out with its flaming appendage. That is going to be a 13 to hit.
Taliesin: That ain't going to hit. That's fine, I'm going to take my bonus action, and I'm going to cast Hex on it.
Matt: On which one?
Taliesin: On the one I just ran away from.
Matt: Okay, that elemental is now currently Hexed.
Taliesin: With a disadvantage on constitution saving throws.
Matt: Oh, okay!
Travis: Hey!
Taliesin: Teamwork!
Travis: I don't think he has any blood, though.
Matt: Is it saving throws, or is it ability checks?
Taliesin: Ability checks.
Matt: That does not affect saving throws, unfortunately.
Taliesin: God damn it. All right, never mind. That's fine. Since I've broken off from him, I'm going to take some shots at him anyway. I'll take three shots.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: First one is an 18.
Matt: 18 hits.
Taliesin: That's seven points of damage. Second one's a sharpshooter. That's 25.
Matt: 25. And with that shot (boom). (cheering)
Travis: Jeez, leave some for the rest of us, big boy.
Marisha: Oh, wait, why did it go back?
Matt: Sorry, this is the one that took all the damage from the Cone of Cold, so this one is still fine. Robbed you of victory!
Chris hardwick: That was so weird, he disappeared for a moment and then came right back!
Taliesin: I haven't actually damaged him yet, have I?
Matt: You did seven damage.
Taliesin: That was the first damage. The second damage I haven't done yet.
Matt: No, you have not.
Taliesin: 20 points of damage.
Matt: All right, nice. You're adding your Hexes to this, right?
Taliesin: No, I'm not! Oh, shit.
Matt: Add d6 to each of these, buddy.
Taliesin: So that's six extra points, and that's seven extra points total. Third sharpshooter shot. Thank you for reminding me on the Hex. That's a 12, that's going to miss.
Matt: 12 misses, unfortunately. You shoot too far. It actually separates its body for a second, the flames flickering away from the impact of the bullet, passing through, no effect, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Weird thing. Can I spend an action surge and put myself out of the fire?
Matt: You can.
Taliesin: You know what, it's just fire. I will be on fire.
Matt: You will be on fire, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to be on fire.
Marisha: It's just fire.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: What is holding the thing that's floating in the sky aloft? Is he flying? Is he supported on a column of fire?
Chris hardwick: No, he's brought a plastic shelf with himself, apparently.
Sam: Oh, of course.
Chris hardwick: He's just standing on it.
Matt: It's Ikea-made, you just have to build it.
Travis: It's the "schlogel."
Matt: It appears to be flying. The very essence of this creature is partial flame and magic, and it's levitating as its lower form is a tiny dervish whirlwind of black ash and flame.
Sam: And he's a larger creature or smaller?
Matt: Large.
Sam: He's a large creature or smaller. Okay. I'm going to make him the boy in the bubble. I will cast Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.
Taliesin: Yay!
Marisha: What is that?
Sam: I'm going to make a bubble around him.
Matt: First you take four points of fire damage, because you're on fire.
Sam: Oh, sure, whatever. No, wait, but it was nine, right? You said? Just four?
Matt: That was when it originally got to you, and then you're still burning every turn until you put yourself out. The range on the resilient sphere is 30 feet, so you're going to want to get closer to cast it.
Sam: Oh, okay. I'll walk. He's going to hit me, isn't he?
Matt: This is cool, currently, if you want to go across. You can get there, and that'll be enough distance.
Sam: I'll do that, and then straight up in the air.
Matt: Okay, so it has to make a dexterity saving throw. What's the DC? The DC on your spells is a 20 right now, right?
Sam: It is.
Taliesin: Wow.
Matt: And it rolled a 19. 18 plus one.
Laura: Oh my gosh!
Matt: And, with that, suddenly you guys see Scanlan concentrate, shouting the magical incantation through the hand cone--
Sam: You're in a ball, motherfucker!
Matt: You see a pink-purple-hued globe of crystalline, magical arcane energy just form around the creature, and the efreet goes (grunting).
Sam: Does he fall, or can he continue to fly?
Matt: The sphere is weightless, so no, he stays where he is.
Liam: And is it a good witch, or a bad witch?
Taliesin: Science check. Does oxygen penetrate the sphere?
Sam: There is still air inside.
Taliesin: Damn it. Because that would've been amazing if he just died.
Chris hardwick: I was looking away, what just happened?
Sam: Oh, fuck!
Chris hardwick: What?
Sam: Always look at me!
Chris hardwick: Oh, I was looking at some grubs over by the--
Travis: Grubs?
Chris hardwick: I'm hungry.
Sam: Oh, and I'll turn around and I will heal Gern, because he's not doing great. With my bonus action, at a second level, I will cast Healing Word, and I will sing to him again, because he loves it so much.
Chris hardwick: You know, I think I'm fine with 26 hit points.
Sam: (singing) Gern, baby, Gern! Candle inferno! Gern, baby, Gern! Burn that mother down!
Matt: All right. Second level, that's 2d4 plus--
Sam: Five.
Matt: 2d4 plus five you heal.
Chris hardwick: Oh, do I roll that?
Sam: Do I roll, or does he?
Matt: Whichever one. Doesn't matter to me.
Chris hardwick: Okay, so nine.
Matt: All right. Scanlan, I believe that ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Chris hardwick: Thank you. I will never again not watch your spellcasting! You tiny bundle of adorable creature!
Marisha: Is that guy and that guy within 30 feet of each other? It's hard to tell with the thing on it.
Matt: There is 30 feet between them, yes.
Marisha: A 30 foot long spell could hit both of them, correct?
Matt: A 30 foot long spell could-- It could only hit one. It's 30 feet between them.
Marisha: Okay. But this guy-- oh, damn it. What about this guy and this guy? They're within 30 feet, right?
Matt: 35 between them. These two, there is definitely.
Marisha: Actually, yeah, let me do that. I am going to cast a Tidal Wave right here and I'm going to go outward in this direction, and it's ten foot wide and 30 foot long, so let me back up a little bit out of it.
Matt: So it's ten feet wide, and it'll go (rushing water) like that, you mean?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so you back up to there?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: All right. Okay, dexterity save on each of them. Dexterity save on the first one.
Marisha: Since it's water, do they have disadvantage?
Matt: No, not for the saving throw. The first one does make the saving throw, however, that is a 19 plus three, so 22. On a success, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone, so it takes half. The other one, however, does fail.
Marisha: Do they take more damage because it's water?
Matt: How much is in the spell?
Marisha: It does 4d8 damage.
Matt: Right, go ahead and roll that. I'd say, how many gallons would that be? That's a shit-ton of gallons.
Marisha: Ooh, that's good. 12 plus eight is 20, plus another eight is 28. Math.
Taliesin: That's a d8 there.
Matt: 14. Okay, so that's 14 and 28. I'd say that Tidal Wave, how many gallons of water would we say each one of those is?
Marisha: It's 30 foot tall.
Matt: Well, it's ten foot tall, ten foot wide, so that's...
Marisha: And 30 feet long.
Taliesin: Four gallons, easily.
Matt: I'd say we're looking at close to 50 gallons of water, right?
Taliesin: Probably way more than 50 gallons.
Laura: That's a lot of gallons, for sure.
Chris hardwick: I think it's like a million gallons.
Sam: Somewhere between 50 and a million.
Marisha: Why didn't we switch to metric?
Taliesin: It would be a few hundred gallons of water.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of this, for the width of it and the space you had to pass it through, we'll say roughly 60 gallons of water passes through each of these elementals. Water susceptibility, for every five feet the elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes one point of cold damage, so they both take an additional 60 points of damage. Which destroys both of the elementals.
Laura: Fuck yeah! Do that again, Keyleth!
Marisha: Okay, I will!
Taliesin: Again, again!
Matt: So Keyleth, you have more movement still, if you want to move somewhere.
Marisha: Oh! I'll scootch up a bit, start moving towards...
Matt: There?
Marisha: That's good, that works.
Matt: Okay. That brings us to Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to rush up where Scanlan is, and attack that little guy on the ground there.
Matt: Right there?
Sam: I'm the little guy on the ground.
Travis: No, not you, the other guy that's next to him. And can I use a reckless attack--
Matt: Are you raging first, or are you--
Travis: Oh yeah, raging. I would like to rage. And then use reckless attack against him!
Matt: All right, so you got two attacks, reckless attack.
Travis: 24?
Matt: 24 hits.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23 hits.
Travis: Awesome. 18 on the first one.
Matt: Nice.
Travis: And 23.
Matt: 23, nice. All right, so as you rush past, looking over at the cooled rock that's starting to crack, and bits of steam vents are starting to push through underneath your feet, Scanlan. The area you're standing on isn't very sturdy, you're probably going to want to move pretty soon. However, you see this barreling form of pure anger and blade come rushing past as Grog slams into the salamander twice with his blade. That fails first constitution, and fails second. So you gain plus two strength, salamander loses two strength.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: However, because you've taken... With each strike within melee of the salamander's heated body, it's so intense by its proximity that you suffer six points of fire damage from the first melee attack against you.
Travis: She gave me resistance, so halved to three?
Matt: Halved to two.
Travis: Halved to two.
Matt: The other one would be 12, so you take six.
Travis: Eight total.
Matt: Total of eight fire damage just from slamming and attacking this salamander. All righty, that brings us to the very end. It is now the salamander's turn. After being hacked twice by you, Grog, it turns around, takes its trident in both hands, looks at you with this horrible snarl. You can see now these glistening, almost ruby-like sharp teeth in its wide grin. (snarl) These long catfish-like tendrils that waft off its face as it slams down the spear towards you.
Travis: Oh, you brought a fork to a sword fight.
Matt: That is going to be a 23 to hit.
Travis: Oh shit, that hits.
Matt: You take 12 points of piercing damage.
Travis: Halved.
Matt: Halved to six. And it's going to also turn around and its tail, its long snake tail (whoosh) whips you. That is going to be an 18 to hit.
Travis: That misses!
Matt: It misses, all righty. The tail comes towards you, and you knock it out of the way with Craven Edge. That will end its turn. Top of the round, I'm going to make a roll for the consistency of the currently cooled lava pool. It maintains. However, you feel your feet cracking beneath--
Sam: I think I'll stay.
Travis: Feels nice here. Maybe a timeshare.
Matt: This efreet-- let me look at the logistics of this spell now, because--
Travis: It's pissed off in a ball.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, this spell is awful.
Sam: It can't do anything.
Matt: It is enclosed for the duration, up to a minute.
Liam: Sorry, Matt. Sorry, Matt.
Travis: He's like, first the beholder, now my flame genie.
Matt: It's pushing against, and it takes these two flame balls it conjures and throws them out towards you guys. They just go (impacts) against the sphere and then go out, and it's just (growling). It's really, really pissed off. It can't do anything.
Chris hardwick: (singing) Like a genie in a bottle. Got to rub me the right way.
Liam: Can we all collectively look up at him, look sad, and go, aw.
Taliesin: I'm looking forward to rolling it back through the rift.
Marisha: Oh my god, can we do that? Like a hamster ball.
Matt: All right. Ending its turn, because it can't do anything, Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, I'm going to scoot up right in front of Keyleth on the edge of the frozen-over pool of lava, but I'm not going to stand on it. And I'm going to chuck three daggers at the salamander in front of Grog.
Matt: Okay. Right there, about?
Liam: Right in front of her. Between her and the-- yeah. There. One, two, three to the salamander.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: 21. Then 25. And then 21.
Matt: Okay, all three hit.
Liam: All right, and because he's flanked by Grog, the first one gets sneak attack damage. Two plus eight, 14, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 31 for the first.
Matt: Nice.
Liam: And then ten for the second and eight for the third.
Matt: All right. Good to know. (whoosh) As you jump in front of the way of Keyleth, you unleash all three daggers in rapid succession, each one finding its mark (impacts) into the body of the now profusely bleeding salamander. You can see now streaks of its own blood are pouring down, boiling on contact with air, the significant difference in temperature from the exterior and its actual interior body causing it to change from a liquid to a gas.
Travis: That's our rogue.
Matt: End your turn?
Liam: I look over my shoulder at Keyleth like a dumb schmuck for a second, and then back at the salamander.
Matt: Okay. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. Am I hiding? Am I hidden?
Matt: You can roll a stealth check. A hide action is a hide action. As a rogue, do you have the--
Laura: What is that number?
Matt: I don't know what number that is.
Laura: It's completely smooshed off of the dice!
Liam: That means that existence is about to end.
Laura: There's literally--
Liam: Just roll this. Roll another one.
Matt: Technically, you do not have cunning action yet, that's a 2nd-level rogue ability, so you would use your action to hide.
Laura: But I had my skirmisher stealth.
Matt: If you go from hide to hide you can do that, but you are not hidden at the beginning of the round.
Liam: It's a rookie rogue mistake. It happens in the beginning.
Laura: Yeah. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. All right, then I'm just going to...
Liam: At the higher levels you mess up the assassinate thing.
Laura: Everything's a concentration thing, so I'm just going to lightning arrow the giant fire guy.
Matt: Right there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Go for it. Roll for attack.
Laura: Okay. 30!
Matt: That'll hit.
Sam: That'll hit anything.
Liam: She just hit a sparrow on a paraglider.
Laura: That's 4d8 lightning damage on a hit.
Matt: Correct, yep.
Liam: Oh. Well, half good, half bad.
Laura: 18. That's it.
Matt: 18 points of lightning damage?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. So as you turn around the side of the tree, releasing the arrow. As it goes through the air, streaking, it suddenly bursts into an arcing bit of energy (crackling energy), a bolt of lightning that strikes into and begins to spill around the insides of the elemental. You can see it shakes it off as the energy disperses.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to use my bonus action to hide then, with the skirmisher's thing. For my skirmisher stealth, I can use a bonus action to hide.
Matt: I'm pretty sure you have to... If you go from hiding to hiding, you can do it.
Laura: You told me, I swear!
Matt: Read the ability, read the ability!
Laura: Okay, where was it?
Liam: Right now, on the air.
Laura: Okay, where is it? I don't know where it is. I'll find it, and then I'll find out. And then I'll roll for stealth then if it works.
Matt: I'll say for the sake right now of the distraction, go ahead and do it for now, and we'll correct it later if need be. I would rather you have fun than not. So, what's your stealth roll?
Laura: My stealth roll is 15, it doesn't even matter.
Liam: 15, she said 15.
Laura: It's not in the book, it's in the--
Matt: No, it's in the PDF. Anyway, what did you roll?
Laura: 15.
Matt: 15, okay. Good to know. End of your turn. This elemental creature--
Liam: Oh jeez. Here it comes.
Matt: Comes up over-- (yelling)
Liam: Oh, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
Marisha: He tripped at the finish line!
Matt: As another one tears out of the portal and begins making its way here at full movement to there. This one's going to go ahead and make two strikes towards you, Scanlan.
Sam: Two attacks towards me?
Matt: Yep. That's going to be 11.
Sam: Is that the attack roll?
Matt: The attack roll. And a natural one. Elementals can't roll today. And you're already on fire, so its fire form won't make much of a difference to you either way. All right, so that's going to end its turn, and the other elemental pours in, that's the end of their round. All right, that brings us to Gern.
Chris hardwick: Oh boy.
Sam: Feel the Gern, feel the Gern.
Matt: Flames are out, you push-- not Stimpy-- Coral off of you, Coral standing (groan).
Chris hardwick: Does it count as my turn if I ask him a question about the orb?
Matt: No, you can make a quick little aside. You have to shout it out, though.
Chris hardwick: If I attack the genie, is it just going to attack the orb, and then he's going to be free?
Sam: Yes! I'm not looking at you, by the way.
Chris hardwick: It really hurts, I didn't realize how much that hurt!
Sam: Yeah, I know!
Chris hardwick: I've learned a valuable lesson today, while I've half-caught on fire. Can I cast some type of a mental spell through the orb to the fire genie?
Matt: You can certainly try.
Chris hardwick: Would it be too crafty if I were to cast Modify Memory? Could I modify the fire genie's memory to forget to not kill himself? I'll take that as a no. Can I modify the fire genie's memory into thinking that he's completed the task that he came to this realm to complete, and that he might go home?
Matt: You can certainly try.
Chris hardwick: I'd love to try.
Matt: Okay. What's the range on the spell?
Chris hardwick: Infinity. (laughter)
Matt: Modify Memory, where is it? There we go, 5th-level.
Taliesin: Oh, God, I hope this works.
Matt: It's a 30-foot range, so you're going to have to get a lot closer. You're getting up from prone, which is half your movement, so you only have 15 more feet you can move, so you wouldn't be able to even get into range.
Chris hardwick: Oh, shit, I can't cast Modify Memory anyway, I've already cast two spells like that today.
Matt: That's true, Cone of Cold. You're out of fifth level.
Chris hardwick: So which way-- is there a chain of people? I see a couple right there.
Marisha: Here's a laser pointer if you need it.
Chris hardwick: Thank you. This guy's new, right?
Matt: Yeah, and this guy hasn't been touched really, except for her lightning arrow.
Chris hardwick: Oh, I can shoot lightning breath, right?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Chris hardwick: Should I shoot at this guy or this guy?
Sam: Well, the guy next to me might hit me, but whatever!
Chris hardwick: I'll throw some lightning breath at this person right here.
Matt: Okay, as you stand up and dust off yourself, your fantastic zipper-covered dance jacket, brushing it off with your hands, you lumber forward to the outskirts of this newly cracking rock crust that once was a lava pool and will soon be once again, inhale. As you guys look around, you see this glow, this blue crackling blow-- glow on the inside of his mouth. The blow is how he got to the mountain and then got inspired to shoot the lightning.
Chris hardwick: I'm flying high, but I can't get an erection. I've done so much blow.
Matt: Gern Blanston. Flying high, no erection.
Chris hardwick: Sad.
Matt: This crackling electric energy in the back of his toothy mouth as he-- (snarl) releases this blast of lightning energy forward, striking into the chest of the fire elemental that freshly stepped out of the portal. What's the saving throw DC on that?
Chris hardwick: 14.
Matt: 14. It rolled a nine, so go ahead and roll the damage on the breath. How much is it?
Chris hardwick: It's 4d6.
Travis: Love the way you're rolling today.
Matt: I'm rolling really bad tonight!
Chris hardwick: Four, ten, 15, 16!
Sam: Yeah, that's good.
Matt: 16 points of lightning damage to that elemental. (impact) It pulls back from the blast. You can see its form has to reconvene. There's a little bit of black and gray smoke that billows out from the wound as it turns to you (snarling). You've definitely got its attention.
Chris hardwick: Hello!
Matt: With your bonus action, would you like to do anything with your compadres?
Chris hardwick: Oh, right. I still have two left, don't I?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: You do like dancing.
Chris hardwick: I'd like to send them off to start dancing just to the left of this gentleman right here. Just to distract him a little bit, because I seem to have caught his attention, so I'd like to start a little dance party right there. This fellow right here, the zombie, can do a little break dancing, and then the skeleton can do a bit of the bird, and then maybe the worm.
Matt: All right. As the skeleton leaps down into the worm (crash), just flat laid out, cracking part of its pelvis...
Chris hardwick: Dancing without music.
Matt: Yep. No music whatsoever.
Chris hardwick: Is the zombie like (zombie groaning). The tip of his arm falls off at the ulna.
Taliesin: Pop and lock! Pop and lock!
Matt: All right. I'm going to go ahead and--
Chris hardwick: These guys are great!
Matt: I'm going to ask you to go ahead and roll a performance check.
Sam: We never do those!
Laura: I feel really bad that I killed Carol now.
Marisha: Oh, that was almost bad.
Taliesin: Wait, plus, plus--
Sam: Oh, you have inspiration!
Marisha: You do!
Laura: Use it!
Sam: Use a d10!
Liam: This is the time.
Chris hardwick: Oh. So seven, plus performance plus one, eight, and then a d10.
Liam: Roll the d10, add it.
Chris hardwick: Jesus Christ. Ten.
Matt: Ten. Trying to recall and hum the song that Scanlan once sang to you, naught but ten minutes before, you don't recall it much at all, and it comes out (tuneless humming).
Chris hardwick: (singing) Gern, Gern, It's Gern. It's Gern time!
Sam: Pitchy, little pitchy. Flat.
Chris hardwick: (singing) It's Gern, time to Gern!
Sam: Well, now you're sharp.
Chris hardwick: (singing) Gern it all the way. I'm doing great!
Sam: Yep, your name was in the song!
Chris hardwick: (singing) Gern is my name and this is definitely the song that I'm singing.
Matt: It's discordant enough that on a low wisdom save I'll say the fire elemental's next attack has disadvantage. That was the strangest round of combat I think I've ever had in D&D. All right, Percy, you're up. Follow that. First, top of your round, you take nine points of fire damage.
Taliesin: That's halved to five.
Laura: I have the skirmisher stealth! As a bonus action at the end of your turn, you can make a dexterity (stealth) check to hide again.
Matt: All right, cool, there you go. Perfect. Wasn't sure if you had to be hidden at the top to do it.
Taliesin: I'm going to shift my Hex to the tiny little (Irish accent) fucker. God, you've got me doing it now. Damn it. It's a plague.
Chris hardwick: It's contagious.
Matt: To which one, this guy there?
Taliesin: No no no, the one furthest from me.
Matt: Right there?
Taliesin: Yeah, right there. I'll move my Hex to him. I'm going to bust out the Bad News rifle, I'm going to sit, and I'm going to take a nice, calm, calculated sharpshooter shot at him.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And Bad News just goes (click).
Matt: Did you misfire?
Taliesin: I misfired.
Matt: Oh no! You get down with the gun and (click). You look at it and you can see some of the metal bowing in the centerpiece like, "That's bad. That's bad. That's bad. That's bad!"
Taliesin: It's fine. I put it down, I pull out the pistol, and I'm going to take a shot.
Marisha: It's hot. It's really hot. Just keep going.
Taliesin: That was really awkward.
Marisha: Maybe the heat made you misfire.
Travis: Just roll the dice.
Liam: You're also 60 feet apart at the moment.
Taliesin: That's a 25 to hit.
Matt: 25 hits. Sharpshooter? No.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: That's sharpshooter? Wow. Nice roll.
Taliesin: Six, 12, 22 points of damage. And I reload, and that's my turn.
Matt: That's your turn. Okay. Finishing up Percy, that brings us to Scanlan. You're still concentrating on Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.
Sam: Oh, yes I am.
Liam: The gnome has got this.
Sam: Hey, how's that stuff under my feet?
Matt: Pretty rough. You're going to want to step off of it very soon, probably.
Sam: I'm going to step into it.
Liam: Love you, Scanlan.
Sam: So I can fire a Lightning Bolt and hit both of those guys.
Matt: Oh, snap. Okay.
Sam: And yeah, that's it. That'll be my--
Matt: You can still move after that.
Sam: Oh, good! Okay, good, thank you for saving me.
Matt: So the bolt arcs past, go ahead.
Chris hardwick: I saw that, it was great!
Sam: Oh, for once! Thank you! Thank you, it was for you!
Chris hardwick: Much appreciated!
Matt: Five, no. And a 12 plus three, 15, no. Both fail their saving throw.
Sam: Okay, so 8d6?
Matt: 8d6 points of lightning damage to both of them. It's a wonderful display, Gern.
Liam: I ship Scanlan and Gern.
Chris hardwick: Shh, guys, please.
Sam: 33.
Matt: 33, nice roll.
Chris hardwick: Oh, that Lightning Bolt was so big. And wide!
Sam: It's the width that really does it.
Chris hardwick: It really does. It's not so much the length.
Taliesin: It's the girth of Gern.
Sam: And I will re-inspire Gern. Oh, wait, you're still injured, aren't you?
Chris hardwick: Yeah.
Sam: I will heal Gern.
Chris hardwick: Please.
Sam: With another Healing Word. This time at third level.
Matt: Technically, a second spell can only be as high as second level. You used two spells in one round.
Liam: It's still very romantic, though.
Sam: Okay, I'll do a 2nd-level Healing Word, and I will sing to him, because I'm running out of things that rhyme with his name: (singing) Gern down for what! (EDM beat) Gern down for what! That's it.
Chris hardwick: Might I remind you I am unable to get an erection at the moment?
Matt: However, in spite of that, the blue pill does give you ten additional hit points healed.
Laura: Did the skeleton and the zombie start dancing better, after that?
Matt: Yeah, it actually does pick up their pace a little bit now that they have a backtrack.
Chris hardwick: What is the elemental doing while they're dancing?
Matt: Well, it's currently being surrounded by a swirl of Hex shadow and looking around very confused and wondering why it got up in the morning.
Taliesin: Where did the glow sticks come from?
Matt: Do you want to move out?
Sam: And I can move out?
Matt: Yeah, you can.
Sam: Will he take a swipe at me?
Matt: It will yes, but better than possibly falling in.
Sam: I'm still on fire, right?
Matt: Yes, you are. Takes an action to put it out, though, unfortunately. That's 18 plus six. I believe that does hit you. You take 12 points of fire damage.
Sam: Plus whatever I was on fire for.
Matt: You already took that damage earlier.
Sam: Oh, I did? At the beginning of my turn.
Matt: Yeah, I rolled for that already, you take nine points of fire damage, I think it was.
Sam: Oh, okay, plus 12?
Matt: Plus 12. If I'm wrong, whatever, it's fine. All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. Keyleth.
Marisha: So we have these two assholes in front of us.
Liam: My name is Vax.
Marisha: Well, depends on the day. So, that guy is still alive too, yeah?
Matt: Yeah, all three of these guys are alive. And this guy's in a hamster ball.
Laura: Being pissed!
Taliesin: It's just like a weather balloon.
Matt: Yeah it's a rover just holding him in place.
Marisha: I'm going to Tidal Wave again. Tidal Wave! Right here, this way, fucking with these two guys.
Matt: All righty, let's go ahead and roll some saving throws on their end. ('The Prisoner' theme starts playing)
Taliesin: Thank you, thank you.
Matt: Yeah. Six and an eight, both fail. Who is number one?
Chris hardwick: I am not a number, I'm a free man!
Matt: So good, so good. The original one, not the remake. Patrick McGoohan. Two failed saving throws, go ahead and roll damage on that.
Marisha: It's really good, I'm warning you right now. Seven and seven is 14 plus another six, brings me to 20, plus eight, 28, again. That's what I had last time right? 28.
Liam: Kismet.
Matt: 28 points of water damage, plus the additional blast of water gallons surging through them, manages to completely scatter both these guys.
Taliesin: We actually had a Critter tweet us how much water.
Matt: How much water would be in a Tidal Wave?
Taliesin: 225 gallons.
Matt: Oh, there is no way they're surviving that.
Marisha: And then technically in Tidal Wave it says the water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in the area within 30 feet of it.
Matt: Unprotected flames are different than lava pools. Water doesn't cool it, it just evaporates.
Taliesin: We've got steam.
Matt: You do. You have a very heavy cloud of steam now, that is (steam sound) to the side. The dancing skeleton and zombie are now just these shadows lit in this cool music video light now as they're (groan) dancing.
Liam: As if this were a Telltale game, at the top of the screen it says, 'Keyleth will remember this'.
Matt: Exactly. Tidal Wave on fire elementals is nasty, man. ("Thriller" starts playing)
Marisha: Can I use my bonus action--
Matt: Perfect. This is happening, guys. Is that the rest of your turn, Keyleth? Do you want to move somewhere?
Marisha: Question.
Matt: Yes, what's your question?
Marisha: Can I theoretically cast a Grasping Vine coming out of the hellmouth?
Matt: No, Grasping Vine is a 4th-level spell, I believe, and as a bonus action you can't do anything more than a 2nd-level spell in the same round.
Marisha: Fuck, never mind. Actually, no, that's not true. I will take my bonus Healing Word to toss another Healing Word, just 1st-level, over to Gern.
Matt: Everyone's keeping the dance master alive over there.
Chris hardwick: Oh my god, amazing.
Marisha: So you heal eight points, Gern.
Matt: Eight points of healing to you, Gern.
Sam: He's gone.
Matt: We can't save him. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I use another reckless attack and I make the first strike against the guy right in front of me.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Jesus. Better. 14.
Matt: 14 misses, unfortunately.
Travis: Damn it.
Matt: Are these with great weapon master?
Travis: No, just reckless attack. This one is with great weapon master. Nope. Better. 16 plus nine is 25, minus five is 20.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Yahtzee! Five, ten, 18, 28!
Matt: 28 points of damage, okay. This time, as you release the first blow of your sword forward, he catches it in the blade of the trident and deflects it off to the side, slamming it into the ground, almost pinning the weapon for a second. He gets up in your face and grins (snarls), and the actual breath that emanates from its teeth begins to burn and singe the edge of your beard hairs. That infuriates you, and you lift up Craven Edge between the blades of the trident. It's a test of strength as you both tense, and eventually you lift it back, and with the backswing, slash him right across his chest with that blow. You see a strike of extremely hot, hot blood splatter across, (sizzling), singe the front of your chest and leave little burn marks on you.
Sam: Yes!
Travis: Like freckles.
Liam: You don't want to fuck with his beard!
Matt: He does make the save.
Chris hardwick: She has a name.
Liam: Sorry, Laura.
Matt: Well played. Does that end your turn?
Travis: Yeah, that's the end of my turn.
Laura: Why am I laughing at that?
Travis: Darling, shush.
Matt: Efreet's going to start pushing against the ball, which is going to begin to coast through the air this way.
Liam: Does he spin the globe?
Matt: Just gliding through slowly.
Travis: Genie hamster.
Matt: Yeah, that's about all he can do this turn.
Sam: Sorry!
Matt: No, no, it's what you do. It's what you do. All right, Vax, you're up.
Liam: Man, all right. I'm in a good spot, I'll just throw three more daggers at the salamander that Grog has not yet killed. First one is a natural 20, the second one is a 13, and the third one is, aw, fuck, is a 14.
Matt: Okay. Hold off on those two attacks, just in case how much your critical sneak attack does.
Liam: Five, six, seven, eight, 12, 18, 21, 25. 25, so you double the dice, is 56 for the first one.
Matt: Okay, so as you throw the dagger, it goes right past Grog's ear and you hear the (whoosh) of the wind as it just brushes past your face. After you finish your backswing with Craven Edge, as the salamander creature rears back from the impact, it looks towards you, and its eyes twitch ever so slightly to your right as it sees the incoming blade a little too late as it (impact) right into its right eye socket. Its tongue lolls out of its jaw as it falls onto its back, and its tail moves and twitches for a few seconds before it eventually goes limp.
Travis: No, no, he's still alive! And I kick him. Now he's dead.
Matt: Grog stomps it into the ground. The twitching stops, the salamander now destroyed.
Travis: Does the dagger stay in his eye socket?
Matt: It's currently in the eye socket, yeah.
Travis: Ooh. Can I reach down and grab it?
Matt: Yeah. You reach down and grab the dagger, and as you pull it out, (poof) it turns into smoke in your hand.
Travis: Holy shit! I look back at Vax.
Liam: Grog, how did you do that?
Travis: I don't know! I think maybe I'm a magic user now! And I start trying to cast reanimate person on the dead thing.
Matt: Okay.
Chris hardwick: That's not how you do that!
Travis: No, no, no, I've got to concentrate!
Chris hardwick: All right.
Travis: (straining)
Laura: Hey, Scanlan!
Sam: Oi!
Laura: What are we going to do with this giant ball?
Sam: We need someone to bring him down to earth. Keyleth, can you vine him down? Or, Gern, do you have something that can move things?
Marisha: Can I--
Chris hardwick: Go ahead.
Marisha: No, go, you first. Please, Gern.
Liam: Does anyone have a large purple hand they could use?
Taliesin: I think he would lose--
Marisha: Yeah, it's a concentration spell.
Matt: Yeah, one spell at a time.
Chris hardwick: I thought I had some sort of a Telekinesis spell, but I guess I don't.
Sam: Chromatic Orb?
Marisha: No, that's an attack.
Laura: Can you bring it down, Keyleth?
Marisha: I can try. Can I do a Grasping Vine from the bottom underneath of him, and see if I can?
Liam: He's over lava.
Sam: He's got something!
Chris hardwick: Oh, sorry, go ahead.
Matt: What are you doing? I know what you're doing, what are you doing?
Chris hardwick: I could either manipulate his memory, or I do have a flying broom.
Sam: What?
Liam: Yes?
Chris hardwick: Yes, I have a flying broom.
Travis: Like you do.
Laura: Are you going to bat him down like you're sweeping the sky?
Chris hardwick: I could fly up and gently glide him down.
Laura: How come everybody flies?
Matt: Are you doing your vine as well?
Marisha: Let me see how this goes first.
Matt: So, without any other command, your two friends, Coral and Stimpy, are still over there dancing as the mist slowly dissipates from the deluge. You pull out from the side of your little satchel there your flying broom, which is a pretty decent, medium-sized broom, places it in the air and it rests there, slightly shifting in place. You leap up onto it and grab onto the front as you shoot up from the side.
Chris hardwick: Going up to catch the golden bitch!
Laura: There's flying brooms?!
Matt: As you place yourself on top of Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, placing all your weight onto it, it sinks a little bit, then it comes to a halt. About three feet it sinks, as you're just standing on top of it.
Marisha: That's as far as it goes?
Matt: What do you want to do?
Chris hardwick: I'd like to try to cast a memory spell on it, if possible.
Matt: Okay. Well, you've already cast a 5th-level spell twice, how many 5th-level spells can you cast per day?
Chris hardwick: Two.
Matt: Yeah, unfortunately you're out of 5th-level slots.
Chris hardwick: Could I cast it on you to forget that I've already cast it twice?
Liam: Scanlan, how much time do we have with this bubble?
Sam: A minute, but about 30 seconds have gone by.
Matt: Yeah, you're getting down to about the 40-second mark.
Taliesin: Can I put myself out while all of this is happening?
Matt: Yes, you can do that.
Sam: Can he push down?
Matt: You can jump onto it and begin to push down.
Chris hardwick: I'm going to push down with all my might, to try to get him down on the ground.
Matt: You leap in the air and jump on it again and as you do the orb (sinking noise) and just slowly, over the next 15 seconds shove it down to the point where you're over the orb on the very top, as you can feel the spell about to dissipate.
Liam: Grog, Grog! Stop trying to reanimate that thing and hit the freaking red guy into the hole!
Matt: Grog, go ahead and roll an arcana check.
Sam: Oh, he's the best at arcana.
Liam: 20. Get it. Get it. Reanimate that fucker.
Travis: Six.
Matt: Six. This isn't working.
Travis: Must be a rookie mistake.
Sam: What are we trying to do, shove him back into the hole?
Taliesin: Shove him in the hole!
Liam: Grog, shove that fucking thing in there.
Travis: He's over lava.
Liam: You are made of hit points!
Travis: All right, fuck it-- This is your thing.
Marisha: Can I do the vines from out of the portal?
Matt: No, it has to have an anchor point somewhere.
Travis: All right, fuck it, now I just run, in a rage, I run into the lava and I start shoving him straight toward the flaming vagina hole.
Matt: Okay, I want you to make an athletics check. Actually, no, this would be a full strength check. Just roll a strength check. You have advantage because you're still raging. Although you wouldn't be raging anymore because you spent time concentrating on the spell, you could go into a rage for this if you'd like to, spend another use of your rage.
Travis: Yeah, I'll use another one.
Matt: Okay, you go into a rage. All right, as you step into the lava, you suffer 26 points of fire damage from wading up to your knees in molten rock.
Marisha: Halved.
Matt: Halved because of your resistance.
Travis: So 12. I rolled a 22.
Matt: 22. With that you, (boof), you shove the sphere, which shifts back about halfway to there. You have to catch yourself on the side, grabbing the broom and holding it out here as you're stepping the other direction. I want you to make an acrobatics check.
Chris hardwick: All right. Seven.
Matt: Seven.
Taliesin: You have inspiration!
Sam: Nope. He used it.
Matt: As you (slipping noise) slip off the top of the sphere, begin to fall back toward the lava behind you, in a very Lord of the Rings Gollum tumbling into Mount Doom type of view. (sploosh) Back first into the lava.
Laura: Oh shit.
Chris hardwick: I feel fine.
Matt: Actually, you take six points of fire damage. Impacting-- rolled really low on that. (sploosh) You can feel the back of your scales and the flesh on your back immediately begin to burn with horrifying pain. You're holding your broom aloft, 'cause you don't want that to go in the fire.
Laura: I run forward to try to help him out.
Sam: And steal the broom.
Matt: And with that, the sphere breaks. (disgruntled moans)
Liam: Crap.
Marisha: Can Keyleth run up, do I have an action?
Matt: Right now we're going back to the initiative order, since combat has re-initiated with the sphere opened. That brings us to the top. The efreet, now freed from its sphere, is going to go first.
Liam: He's mad.
Matt: He is livid. All right.
Travis: I just want you to know, I was trying to free you.
Sam: I don't know these people.
Liam: These assholes.
Travis: Can you believe how rude these people are?
Matt: He's going to fly back up. (groans)
Matt: Keep away. Let's see. It's going to cast Invisibility on itself, then it vanishes from view.
Marisha: Great.
Sam: As it does that, do I recognize the spell?
Matt: You do.
Sam: I cast Counterspell.
Matt: Yes, you can. Go ahead and roll-- Oh, wait, no, it's a 2nd-level spell. It auto-- Yeah. Yeah. Because it is a 2nd-level spell.
Sam: Hi!
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: As its form begins to vanish, Scanlan, what do you do to counter it?
Sam: I'm going to sing-- No! I'm going to distract it with this.
Taliesin: With an app?
Sam: With an app. (airhorn) (song starts) Oh, wait that's not what I wanted to do!
Chris hardwick: Keep going! Distract him with your morning radio program!
Matt: And that bit of chaos is just enough, as he begins to cast his innate Invisibility spell, it looks over. "What in the-- Shit!" And loses the spell concentration. The invisibility field vanishes, and it stands there above. All right, that brings us to Vax.
Liam: Oh, shite. All right, I'm going to leap over the lava pit.
Matt: Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Yeah. That'll be a 28. I run up behind Grog, and I should be within--
Matt: Darting around the side there, because you are hasted with this, so you can actually just dart around the side.
Liam: All right, right behind Grog. I should be within 60 feet of the efreeti.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And I'll throw three daggers at it.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: First one is a 34.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Second one is a 27. Third is a 29, so they all hit.
Matt: Shit, jeez, 34.
Liam: But there's no sneak attack on these--
Matt: How did you get 34 on your attack?
Liam: I don't know anymore. I rolled really high, and I rolled my attack bonus, like a 19 plus 11? A 30?
Matt: 30, okay.
Liam: I don't know.
Matt: That's okay. A 30 works.
Liam: Math looked right when I did it.
Matt: 34, I was just like (groaning) bleeding from the nose, I couldn't deal with it. 30 hits.
Liam: There's no subterfuge, it might be stupidity. First one's a ten, second one was a ten, and the third one is a seven.
Matt: Seven. Got it. Cool. That ends your turn, Vax. That brings us to Vex.
Laura: Hunter's Mark!
Matt: All right. It is...
Laura: It wasn't, because I used Lightning Arrow, so it dropped the concentration on it.
Matt: That's right, so you Hunter's Mark once again. Put that back on there. All right.
Laura: Although it doesn't really matter because I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on him and I lose my Hunter's Mark again.
Travis: Trauma from the earlier episodes. Hunter's Mark!
Matt: All right, so Lightning Arrow again, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Laura: Oh yeah! Oh, that's 31?
Liam: 79!
Laura: 31!
Matt: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Okay!
Matt: Gern, you're on deck.
Laura: 23!
Matt: 23 points of damage, all righty.
Laura: That's better.
Matt: (impact) The lightning slams into his chest, and you can see it arcs through its scimitar that it's holding up in its hand, and it shakes and almost drops the weapon, and catches its arm as the electricity disperses out the edge of the blade and looks back at you. He's now glaring at both you and Scanlan.
Laura: I'm going to use my movement to run up around the molten lava and hold my hand out for Gern, so that he can use me to get out of the molten lava.
Matt: All right, that's as far as you can get there.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Gern, top of your turn, you take 24 points of fire damage from the lava as you're sinking into it. (sizzling)
Chris hardwick: So, can I jump up and then cast a spell?
Matt: Right now you can try and cast, in this area, but you would have a hard time concentrating. I'd say you'd have to take a concentration check to even get a spell out, because you're in so much pain. I'd say you would probably want to move out of the lava before you do that.
Chris hardwick: All right, I'll get out of the lava.
Matt: So you (straining) stand up.
Laura: Take my hand!
Matt: It's too deep and you're having to basically wade your way through, which is burning your hands as you get over there.
Chris hardwick: What about my broom?
Matt: You were holding your broom! So here's what you do. You go ahead and you lift yourself up out of the lava onto the broom and then (blowing) push. You're not fully on it, and it's hard to engage its mental commands directly with the current amount of chaos around you, but you do manage to skirt yourself to the very edge of the lava and land on your feet, which are numb after the sheer amount of pain you've suffered, and you don't even want to look down at what you look like from the waist below.
Laura: Do you need me to hold your broom while you cast your spell?
Chris hardwick: Please!
Laura: Thank you!
Sam: Oh, don't do-- Okay.
Matt: So she takes the broom from your hand. What are you going to cast?
Chris hardwick: Disintegrate.
Matt: Okay!
Travis: Disintegrate?
Sam: That's a spell?
Liam: That's a big one, we've seen that happen.
Sam: We have?
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: Who did that?
Liam: The giants got disintegrated.
Chris hardwick: I'm fairly pissed at the moment.
Matt: As you should be. All right, so you get to go ahead and roll.
Liam: Get the fucker, you dirty bastard.
Matt: Let me get to the spell here real fast. Disintegrate. Oh, it just makes a dexterity saving throw! It doesn't even get a chance. All right, what's your spell DC again?
Chris hardwick: 16.
Matt: 16. It rolled a two.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: That's going to be bad. All right, roll 10d6 plus 40 damage. Damn!
Travis: 10d6?
Matt: Disintegrate doesn't mess around. It's an all or nothing spell. If they make the save, nothing. You don't make it, (explosion).
Chris hardwick: 27, 33, 36... So 76!
Matt: 76 points of force damage. As you get out, you can see your vest itself is burning, there's still elements of embers burning at the edges of the leather and the cloth. The bottom part of your scales are a combination of blue, black, and little bits have cracked open where you can see red flesh underneath. There's a lot of burn damage.
Chris hardwick: The zippers are very hot, I might add.
Matt: They're really glowing. However, as you turn around, as your fin jewelry on the sides of your face jangles with the speed as you spin around and point your finger upward, the arcane energy forming at the end of your finger, this singular beam of dull green arcane energy streaks forward. The efreet, who is currently focused on Scanlan and watching Vex run past, looks down just in time to see you release the spell. Opens his eyes and attempts to dodge out of the way, unfortunately not fast enough. It blasts in the side of its shoulder and you can see as a whole chunk of its back muscle, shoulder, and lower torso are just turned to dust, exposing bone and elements of its musculature and flesh underneath. It goes (snarls) and looks down. It can't even make a loud emission of pain, it's just gutturally whispering its horrible suffering. As it looks down, it reaches up with its hand and cauterizes the wound on the back of its body, leaving it a charred cinder. It glares down at you, extremely angry. "I hate you most of all, scarecrow!"
Chris hardwick: Go back to your fire slit!
Matt: Percy, you're up. Unless you want your dudes to do anything, by the way. They're still over there dancing.
Chris hardwick: They should get a little bit closer and dance in front of him, just to make sure. They get very self-conscious if no one's paying attention.
Sam: Of course.
Matt: They're just cheering on.
Travis: At least they're dancing while I'm standing on fire.
Taliesin: Can I knock him down a notch? Can I try and shoot him to drop him out of the sky a bit?
Matt: You can certainly try.
Taliesin: I'm going to try. First of all, I'm going to Hex him. He's hexed. I point.
Matt: All right, so the Hex moves over.
Taliesin: Hex moves over. And I'm going to take a shot to try and drop him. I'm going to take a grit shot to drop him.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: That's 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Taliesin: And that's, what's the saving throw for that? Strength throw.
Matt: Strength? 23.
Taliesin: Aw, really?
Matt: Yeah. Sorry.
Taliesin: That's fine, he'll just take his damage.
Matt: Little bitch. Plus 1d6, don't forget.
Taliesin: Yes, thank you.
Matt: Wow, Disintegrate spell fucked him up.
Taliesin: That's 17 points of damage.
Matt: Nice.
Taliesin: I'm going to shoot again.
Matt: Is this with your pistol?
Taliesin: Yeah, just with the pistol right now.
Matt: And what's your first range increment on that?
Taliesin: 400.
Matt: The pistol?
Taliesin: Yeah. 1,200 for Bad News.
Matt: Your first range increment.
Taliesin: I'm sharpshooter, I have no range increment.
Matt: That's right. Good call. All right, so fire again.
Taliesin: Range increments are for-- We don't do that here.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: That's a 31 to hit.
Matt: That hits, roll damage. Scanlan, you're up next, by the way.
Taliesin: And that's 16 points of damage.
Matt: All righty. (two impacts) Just as it manages to cauterize the wounds from the Disintegrate spell, both bullets blast into its torso, and you can see it's now, thinking the height advantage would be helpful, after being locked in a hamster ball and now being repeatedly blasted from every which way, it's not enjoying its current experience by any means.
Taliesin: It's going to get worse. All right, and now I'm doing a sharpshooter shot.
Marisha: Pew pew.
Taliesin: Pew pew. That's 18?
Matt: 18 hits.
Taliesin: And that's 12, 18, 28 points of damage.
Matt: Nice! This one (impact) blasts into the center of its chest, and you can see part of its pectoral muscle tears open and flame erupts from the impact. It reaches up and (snarling).
Taliesin: Action surge. Fuck this guy. Same thing, sharpshooter. I'm going to be rolling sharpshooter.
Matt: Go for it, okay.
Liam: Get the other nipple, now?
Taliesin: The other nipple.
Marisha: Matching piercings.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22 hits. This is going to be a rough round for him.
Taliesin: 27 points of damage.
Matt: Ooh!
Taliesin: Reload and one more shot!
Laura: Jesus Christ! I mean.
Taliesin: Reload, one more shot.
Matt: You got it.
Taliesin: That's 17, 27, 29--
Matt: That's a hit. Go for it, roll damage.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: Damn, man.
Taliesin: 21 points of damage.
Matt: All right. (two impacts) These holes are beginning to appear in its body where the bits of fiery flesh are being blasted away from the impacts of your weapon. All right, that brings us to Scanlan!
Laura: It didn't kill him?
Taliesin: No, but he's a sieve now.
Matt: You guys held him--
Liam: He just took 100 points of damage.
Taliesin: He took a lot of damage.
Sam: Hey, that Ioun stone that I have? Does that allow me to cast a fourth level three spell?
Matt: If the spell you put into it was a fourth 3rd-level spell, yeah.
Sam: It was a 3rd-level spell, so it's an extra 3rd-level spell?
Matt: Right.
Sam: I'm maxed out on 3rd-level spells, but I still have that thing.
Matt: Yeah, so it wouldn't be a 4th-level spell because you didn't cast into it as a 4th-level.
Sam: No, I mean, the fourth time I've cast a 3rd-level spell.
Matt: Oh, got you. It wouldn't count against your daily. It's in addition to that.
Sam: Okay! So I will, for the first time ever, use that stupid Ioun stone and cast Lightning Bolt again. I'm just sticking with my method here.
Matt: All right, all right. With a five, it does not make its saving throw. Go ahead and roll damage. 8d6.
Sam: 8d6, thank you.
Liam: Here comes the cube.
Chris hardwick: 23, 28.
Sam: Thank you. Did you do this one too? 28!
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Both kills! Both of them!
Sam: I think I would like to, if there's a way, I'd like to angle it somehow so that he will drop right on top of Grog. I feel like Grog can do something to a falling behemoth.
Matt: It's hard-pressed from this angle, unfortunately. Grog is at an angle where you wouldn't really be able to do that.
Sam: Damn it.
Matt: Mind you, when you blast him, he'll plummet close to his feet, if you wanted to.
Sam: All right, yes, let's do that so Grog can feel like he gets part of this, too. And if I can, I'd like to burn a big S in his chest.
Matt: So, as you charge up and blast the lightning bolt from your crotch region, you then do a little dance maneuver with your waist, causing it to (crackling) carve a Scanlan S into the torso of the efreet. As it plummets to the ground, slamming into where the lava would be, while the fire doesn't hurt its form, you can see, Grog, as it stands in the ground (groaning). Its form is turning into ash around you. It's actually just dissipating and turning to ash as its eyes roll up and meet with yours.
Travis: I run over in the lava and I go, I'd like to cast Beheading!
Matt: All right. You suffer 26 points of fire damage, reduced to 13 from taking another round in there.
Travis: Not a problem. Totally worth it for the spell.
Matt: As you take Craven Edge and take the head off. As the head rolls away--
Travis: I grab it!
Matt: You grab it! It turns to ash.
Travis: (panting) I run out of the lake.
Matt: You get out of the lava, stand on the side, and look over just as the rest of the head turns to ashes.
Travis: Aw, shit.
Laura: I walk up to Grog.
Liam: You did it again!
Laura: I pat him on the shoulder, and say, that was so impressive. A genuine mage! And I use sleight of hand to shove the flying broom into the Bag of Holding.
Matt: Okay. Roll sleight of hand.
Taliesin: Whoa!
Liam: Yeah, girl.
Chris hardwick: Am I allowed to roll a perception?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Liam: Come on, Vex. Come on, sister.
Laura: 18?
Liam: Get it.
Chris hardwick: 16.
Matt: Plus?
Taliesin: No.
Matt: Total of 16?
Chris hardwick: 15 plus one, yeah.
Matt: As you're dealing with this, you have no notice of this. You may question it later, if you like, but you have no idea where it went, and didn't see any of this transaction happen.
Laura: Oh no! Oh no!
Sam: What, what is it?
Laura: Your broom fell in the lava!
Chris hardwick: What?
Laura: I saw it!
Chris hardwick: I just turned around for a moment!
Laura: I tried to give it back to you and it fell in the lava!
Chris hardwick: Are you sure?
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: You shouldn't have looked at me when I cast my spell!
Chris hardwick: This is why I never looked at you before!
Sam: I was wrong to doubt you!
Chris hardwick: No! No, you're a constant source of disappointment!
Laura: 18.
Chris hardwick: Where's my fucking broom?
Matt: Make an insight check now.
Chris hardwick: Insight. 13.
Matt: 13. She's telling the truth, man. That broom just went straight in the lava.
Sam: You're a horrible person.
Chris hardwick: You know, I'm really good at reading people, and I know that you're telling me the truth right now.
Laura: I'm so sorry.
Chris hardwick: No, I feel your sorrow. I feel it. I feel bad for you, that you have to experience that! It's just a broom. Right? It's just a flying broom that's very difficult to find, no big deal.
Laura: I wouldn't know. I don't even know.
Chris hardwick: That's all right. You know, it actually-- It sterilized me, actually, I'm quite glad. It has very dirty properties. Anyone that would put it between their legs to fly around would be in horrible danger. Horrible danger. So it's actually probably for the better.
Sam: Communicable diseases?
Chris hardwick: Yeah, so many STDs. It's really just like a disease tampon, is really what it is.
Liam: A what? Is that like a magic candle?
Chris hardwick: It's sort of like a magic candle.
Laura: A tragedy candle.
Chris hardwick: It's a tragedy candle.
Taliesin: A Blanston candle.
Chris hardwick: Yes.
Liam: I don't understand sorcery at all.
Matt: At this point, you hear the flickering of flame and the portal itself has begun to expand even further, glowing brighter.
Marisha: Keyleth throws up a Skywrite spell and says, we're taking the portal.
Matt: Okay. As this is happening, the flames themselves grow higher and higher. The lava begins to boil and roil. As you guys all move up to the side, you can see the lava is beginning to (bubbling) splash out and spray bits are starting to scatter as some of the nearby trees tumble over. You can see the four Fire Ashari as well as Korren come across one of the clearings. The other way, you see what looks to be another salamander gets thrown about 15 feet from the trees, hits the ground, skids, and is motionless as you see Cerkonos with the rest of the Pyrah, the Fire Ashari stepping through. "Keyleth. We saw your symbol. Is it time?"
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "All right. Let us try to close this rift." And the rest of the druids all begin to gather around the outside of this portal. As it's flickering, you can see, piercing into the extremely blinding light, Keyleth, you take a moment, and using your attachment to the Fire Ashari and the Fire Elemental Plane from your last passage through it, you can see past the brightness and see beyond the doorway. You can see on the other side, there appears to be probably another half dozen or a dozen or so of a few other elementals and salamanders that are now making their way towards the portal.
Marisha: I stand next to my father and join the rest of the druids.
Laura: Grog, you should probably help them with all of your magic powers.
Travis: Do you think so? It feels like it's an intimate thing.
Laura: Just hold your hands up, hold your hands up.
Travis: All right.
Matt: All right. As the rest of the Ashari begin to gather around the portal and concentrate, they are managing to hold the rift in its current size. You see as beads of sweat begin to pour down Korren's face, not used to this type of terrain. He goes (gasps), "We need more power!"
Travis: Okay!
Matt: "If you can aid, whatever you have to bring to this, please, now is the time!" Does anyone wish to help with the ritual?
Laura: Oh, yeah.
Chris hardwick: I'll help.
Matt: All right, how would you wish to help?
Sam: What a nice guy he is! Certainly not someone we should swindle!
Liam: Strange that you would say that.
Chris hardwick: I would know if someone were trying to swindle me, believe me.
Sam: That's true. That is true!
Chris hardwick: You all have honest faces. Particularly her, over there. Very honest face. What can I do to help?
Matt: What do you think would lend itself to a fire gate-sealing ritual? It could be a spell, it could be a use of a skill. How would you like to--?
Sam: A candle? Do you have any candles that could aid?
Laura: Like fiery candles, maybe?
Chris hardwick: I have a-- No, this one casts-- This is bright light, there's a thunder candle. Blink candle. Destroy-- No, that destroys dexterity. I have a thunder candle, but I don't know if that would work.
Matt: Make an arcana check.
Chris hardwick: 19.
Matt: 19. The Blink candle, which you crafted from various parts from blink dogs and other creatures that have natural translocation capabilities, might have the capability, as this is a doorway between planes, and teleportation magic is based on creating short-form doorways between similar spaces, might have some impact on the ritual if used properly.
Chris hardwick: I have this Blink candle. It's formed from various animals that blink and if-- that has trans-dimensional properties, very good properties. The best kind of robust properties that I can throw it in, and it might help stop the-- from-- all of that.
Travis: That makes perfect sense.
Chris hardwick: Right. So we're all in agreement, then.
Sam: Well-explained!
Chris hardwick: All right. So I'm going to hand Blink candle to Coral and I'm going to have Coral walk into the portal.
Travis: Brave Coral.
Chris hardwick: Brave Coral. Fuck, I've lost two and my broom. What a fucking terrible day.
Matt: As Coral takes the candle, (groans) turns around and begins to just slowly melt, steps into the lava.
Liam: Run, Coral, run!
Matt: Nine points of fire damage to Coral who was already sitting at--
Chris hardwick: Six.
Matt: And had taken six damage, right? So 15 from 33. Coral's at half health. Coral, as this is rough terrain, gets part of the way there, then continues walking forward the rest of the way. Takes an additional 17 points of damage.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: So that's 32 points of damage. What's Coral's hitpoints? 33 is the max?
Laura: That's what you said.
Matt: Yep. On the sheet right there. I can read my own text. 33 hit points. Coral, at one hitpoint, gets up to the lava, take the candle and (boof). As the energy expands from it, you can see a ripple, a heat wave ripple, that billows outward. Coral vanishes entirely and the portal shrinks down by about five to six feet, actually closing in its space
Chris hardwick: Oh, Coral, I forgot to tell you somethi-- fuck.
Matt: Suddenly you hear a (zip) and Coral appears about ten, 15 feet in the air--
Chris hardwick: Oh good, there you are. Listen, did you see my broom?
Matt: Smack! Coral falls those 15 feet, taking six points of bludgeoning damage. Let's see if Coral survives this with Undead Fortitude. Nope. That is a roll of eight versus a total DC of 11 with the damage taken, and Coral just splats like a really, really old orange just slammed into the concrete, just (splatting).
Travis: Like an old orange.
Matt: One of the Fire Ashari goes (cringing, gagging) and just ends up concentrating on holding the gate.
Chris hardwick: I'm starting to think you're all very bad luck.
Matt: However, that did aid the ritual. We have two more folks who could aid in this ritual.
Laura: I can use-- I don't know if it will help, but I have a really great diamond of awesomeness that's precious.
Matt: How would that help the ritual?
Laura: I don't know.
Marisha: Am I a part of the people who could be included in the ritual too?
Matt: Yeah. Oh yeah.
Marisha: Okay. I am going to cast a 7th-level Plane Shift to help smush it closed.
Matt: All right, go ahead and make a nature roll with advantage. This is your understanding of the natural elements of the world around you and the connection you have with the fire elemental plane.
Laura: I don't know how this magic stuff works.
Travis: Oh, I'll teach you later.
Marisha: 12. Oh, with advantage. 23
Matt: 23. As you begin to concentrate, your hands instinctively burst into flames to coalesce your connection to the Fire Elemental Plane. As you complete the Plane Shift spell, your form shimmers for a second, and for a moment it looks like she's only partially there. She's actually translucent, as flames begin to lick up the sides of her body. At this point, you can see the lava flow in the mountain begins to slow and the bubbling begins to come to a stillness. The portal itself shimmers again and then shrinks down to the size of a normal doorway, about five foot by ten foot tall, and it's just barely holding on. As you're concentrating on holding it in its place, you can see now the rest of the druids around are sweating profusely. Who wishes to take on the last part of this ritual?
Travis: I have a Firebrand Warhammer. I could hit it. Anybody else got anything better?
Laura: Do you have any magic stuff, Scanlan?
Sam: I can inspire them. I mean...
Travis: Your Dimension Door?
Marisha: Do you have your Dimension Door?
Sam: Dimension Door what?
Marisha: A door. I did Planar Binding, which technically really wasn't supposed to do what I just did--
Matt: Planar Shift you said.
Marisha: Planar Shift, I mean, yes. 7th-level.
Matt: Finding ways to tailor magic essences into this type of a ritual.
Sam: Do I know that that will work or help?
Matt: You don't know. You'll find out. However you wish to aid this ritual and justify how it would be helpful in this instance.
Liam: There's something I could do.
Travis: Yeah, spit it up.
Liam: I whip the Cape of the Mountebank out of my pocket and run at that door and jump off the edge and just try to balloon umbrella it down over with that red cape.
Matt: Hmm. Okay.
Laura: Matador it.
Liam: I'm doing it. I'm matadoring it.
Matt: Okay. I will say-- hmm. How do I make this work? I'm going to want you to go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Okay. That is a 25.
Matt: All right. You rush up, leaping off the side, spinning in the air. As you, do you unfurl the cape and turn it into a limited parachute-type projection and as you slam it down towards-- I need you to go ahead and make a wisdom check to see if you have the capability of triggering the magic of the item at the right time to be impactful.
Liam: Cross your fingers, everybody.
Travis: Come on, Vax.
Liam: No bonuses here.
Chris hardwick: No whammys.
Marisha: We don't still have our fancy feast, do we?
Sam: Oh, yeah, are we still feasting?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: So what does that mean? Advantage.
Marisha: You have advantage on wisdom throws.
Liam: That's better. That is 13.
Matt: 13? That's better. As you come down, you take the cape and encase, you trigger the magic, at which point the remainder of this doorway just blinks out entirely, the cape gone. The doorway, gone.
Liam: Hot hot hot hot hot.
Matt: As Vax (splashing) right into the lava.
Marisha: I take a Grasping Vine from the edge and try and yank him back.
Matt: Okay. You take 22 points of fire damage as you splat into the lava.
Liam: The Deathwalker's Ward is set to fire.
Matt: So it resisted to 11. So you (splashing) in the lava. All of a sudden, images flash in your head of the time that you lost most of your foot in the Underdark. And you go--
Liam: No no no no no no no no!
Matt: And, before you can even react, all of a sudden, something wraps around your waist and yanks you out as a vine pulls you in an arc and slams you into the hard obsidian floor on the outside of the lava flow. The rest of you gather there as the rest of the druids finish their concentration. The lava pools themselves have gone still and you can see elements beginning to cool, and there's currently no sign of a tear between the elemental planes that's currently bursting through.
Travis: Nice job, Vax!
Liam: Where am I, am I near her, on the ground?
Matt: She would be back here. You're on the ground, right next to a dancing skeleton.
Marisha: I moved up, I moved up. I would be over there.
Matt: You would be part of the ritual. But you fell next to the dancing skeleton.
Liam: Okay, I look at the skeleton, I look at her. I look at the skeleton, I look at her. I'm an idiot.
Marisha: Yeah, no, I already knew that. It's fine. You did good. You did good. I reach down and I help him on his feet. How bad are you?
Liam: I'm pretty bad.
Marisha: I Cure Wounds, level four.
Travis: Yeah, cool, do that. I'm going to walk out of the lava now. (laughter)
Matt: Taking another 21 points of fire damage. Reduced to ten. The druids look around and give a nod of acceptance. All of them acknowledge you, who they have not met and don't understand quite where you came from or why you're here. One of them, who is currently missing an arm on one hand. Dark, weathered skin, long jet black hair cruising down to the middle of his back, approaches you and his one right arm he puts on the shoulder and says, into your eyes, "I do not know you, friend, but you have come to our aid at an hour when we really required it."
Chris hardwick: Great, sure, I just thought I'd come and lose a couple of thralls and my fucking broom. But great to be here. Everyone seems nice. Especially her, she's great.
Matt: He removes his hand. "Very well."
Chris hardwick: Let me know if I can do anything else! Do you want a candle?
Matt: "Candle?"
Chris hardwick: Well, I make candles, just various candles.
Matt: He does this and his finger bursts into flame and you can see a flame flickering. "We do not need candles here in Pyrah. But thank you."
Liam: Is that the finger? Or is that the finger?
Matt: Insinuated, actual finger. At this point, Korren, your father, approaches you and places a hand on your shoulder, and turns you around to look you in the face. And you can see there's smears of dirt and still glistening from sweat from the whole ritual and looks a bit weathered and winded from the experience. "Keyleth, I'm proud of you."
Marisha: Thank you, Father.
Matt: I think we will stay here and help the Pyrah try and rebuild.
Marisha: Oh. Okay.
Matt: And he takes your chin and pulls it up and looks you in the face with a broad smile on his face, he says, "The road before you, Keyleth, is hard and fraught with loss and sadness. To live is to struggle against the void. But it's those moments of darkness that define the joy of the world around them. Learn from the loss and push forward as a beacon of perseverance, of hope for life after pain. This is one of the pillars of strength of a leader. One that I have learned with the loss of your mother. But you are my beacon of hope. And to many more than you even expect." And he looks back towards the four other members of the Zephrah tribe that are all just looking at you, and they nod.
Marisha: I hope I do not fail you, Father.
Matt: "I trust you will not. Go forth, while we stay here. I want you to grasp your destiny, vanquish this terrible beast that lies on the shores of Tal'Dorei. Complete your Aramente."
Marisha: How do you know that this is my destiny?
Matt: "Whatever your destiny is, grasp it. But you've chosen this path, and all destiny really is, is the choices you make, leading towards a goal that perhaps you do not yet understand. But when you've returned I wish for you to teach us the wisdom you've gained on this journey."
Marisha: Kaitiaki, father.
Matt: "Kaitiaki, Keyleth."
Chris hardwick: Did you see a broom lying around anywhere?
Matt: "No."
Chris hardwick: Sorry.
Matt: "It's all right, we will keep an eye out for it though."
Chris hardwick: Please. And tell everyone #feelthegern. They'll know what it means.
Sam: What is a hashtag?
Chris hardwick: I'll explain later.
Sam: All right.
Matt: "Well, unless there's anything else, we have business to attend to in restoring this area. I wish you all great luck. "
Marisha: Korren, If we should ever need you-- if I should ever need you, or the assistance of the Ashari, what is the best way to get hold of you?
Matt: "Call to Zephrah. Come home. And we will come with you." As he looks over all of you, giving each a look of-- a nod of respect and appreciation-- ("Don't You" by Simple Minds plays)
Liam: Wow.
Taliesin: I felt it coming.
Matt: Glances past to Grog, Vex, and lingers a very long look on Vax, and just gives you a nod.
Laura: His diamond earring is glistening in the light.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Did I stutter?
Matt: "Stay safe. For her sake." And Korren turns around and walks back, as the rest of the Zephrah Ashari walk along with him. You, through all this chaos, get a little bored and frustrated with all this weird nonsensical stuff, look at the ground and realize there's a lot of hidden treasures scattered amongst this vicinity.
Chris hardwick: Probably so. You know, I might stay behind a bit and dig around for a little while. You know, candlemaking's a difficult business.
Sam: Is it now?
Chris hardwick: Aye.
Taliesin: Well, if you're ever looking for more customers, you'll always find them in Whitestone. So, if you make your way north.
Chris hardwick: Excellent!
Taliesin: You're always welcome.
Chris hardwick: Thank you. Could someone heal me a bit before you leave? I'm quite singed.
Taliesin: Oh my!
Laura: I walk up and I cast Cure Wounds on him. I've got jack shit.
Chris hardwick: She's so nice!
Sam: She's great.
Chris hardwick: She's the nicest!
Laura: At a level three for you!
Chris hardwick: That's really nice of you.
Travis: You're a really good person.
Laura: I am! I am. 20 points.
Travis: Holy shit!
Sam: Vex?
Laura: Yes?
Sam: This gentleman has done nothing but aid us.
Laura: I know, and it's so kind of him.
Sam: He's suffered the loss of three of his--
Laura: Look at all these treasures he's going to find here for his candles!
Sam: Is there anything we can do to repay you?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: That scimitar that the genie had, did it fall into the lava?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: 18.
Matt: As you look down and say "all these treasures around," you get a closer look. The ground here is rugged rock and black ash and dust and pieces of charred and burnt, petrified wood, and right around the outskirts of where the lava pool is, you can see what look to be broken slivers of soot-covered dragon scale just peppered throughout the landscape. Barely visible until you look real close, thanks to the constant barrage of blacken soot and dust that falls from the nearby area.
Laura: Do you collect dragon scales for your candles?
Chris hardwick: Oh, I forgot to tell you. I sold out my own kind because I was enslaved by dragons who had tails who consider themselves royalty and therefore better than me and I don't have a tail. And so I spent my whole life trying to figure out how to turn scales into weaponized candles. Anyway, got to go, everyone have a great time! Thank you!
Matt: You just leave?
Chris hardwick: I leave! Scoop up some of the few scales and piss off.
Matt: You guys watch as Gern Blanston begins walking around and, like a gutter snipe, or one of the people on the beach with a metal detector, starts combing through.
Chris hardwick: (singing) Don't you forget about me!
Laura: Gern! Before you leave!
Chris hardwick: Aye?
Laura: You know, we're killing a very, very large dragon, hopefully rather soon.
Chris hardwick: Very interesting! Where would that be?
Laura: Well, he's in Emon now, but we're gathering our forces in Whitestone.
Chris hardwick: Good to know! I might catch up with you later on.
Laura: All right!
Chris hardwick: Good-bye!
Laura: Good-bye!
Matt: Which she says with a strange doppler effect even though he's but 20 feet away from you and has chosen to ignore the rest of your party to go about his business.
Chris hardwick: It's just like an NPC, just Skyrim.
Matt: As your skeleton's in the background dancing.
Chris hardwick: There's only one left!
Matt: Yeah, only one left.
Taliesin: He's freezeframe.
Matt: There's plenty of charred corpses littered all over this mountaintop you could make undead from.
Travis: Does the skeleton go with him, or does it stay?
Matt: It follows him. All right, so the rest of you, what is your next course of action?
Liam: I sidle up next to my sister and stand there for a moment and deadpan say, boy, the more things change, the more they stay the same. And then I walk away. (laughter)
Taliesin: Keyleth, why don't we head home?
Marisha: Which home?
Sam: How do we do that?
Travis: Whitestone.
Laura: Can we get to Whitestone, can you bamf us?
Marisha: I can, yeah.
Laura: Let's go there and rest up.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Hey, thank you guys. Thanks for coming, for helping.
Laura: Your dad is very noble.
Sam: Your homeland is, you know, I mean, the volcano, the magma, the monsters, the fire torn in the sky, it's lovely. It's charming, really.
Marisha: Thank you, Scanlan. This isn't my homeland. I appreciate how well you know me after all these years.
Sam: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you lived here.
Marisha: No, this is the Fire Ashari's camp.
Sam: You're not a Fire Ashari?
Marisha: I'm an Air Ashari.
Liam: It's all right, it's only been a couple of years.
Sam: Aren't all Ashari the same?
Marisha: You know what, Scanlan, that might be the most questions you've ever asked me about myself.
Sam: I don't even know your last name!
Marisha: I don't have one.
Sam: Hey, what's a hashtag?
Laura: Hey, Gern! Gern! Gern! Gern!
Chris hardwick: Hello?
Laura: Is it just dragon scales, or is it any dragon parts you use?
Chris hardwick: You know, mainly dragon scales, but I do like to see them blown apart, so that part's merely for pleasure.
Travis: You could give him five pounds of dragon scales.
Marisha: I pick a tree that's big enough to fit all of our fat faces.
Matt: You already cast Transport via Plants this day, that's how you got here.
Marisha: Maybe we should rest.
Travis: Do you need me to help you with the tree spell?
Laura: Maybe we should just sleep here and rest up and spend the night, wake up in the morning, head back to Whitestone.
Taliesin: He's going to still be there next week, by the way.
Matt: And with that, Vox Machina leaves Gern to his business as they go and camp out at the base of the mountain.
Chris hardwick: Did someone lose an orb?
Matt: And with that, we're going to finish tonight's game! (laughter)
Chris hardwick: Can I say something from this realm?
Matt: Yeah.
Chris hardwick: I'm delighted. We showed a thing tonight on @Midnight of someone lounge singing Stand By Me to Donald Trump and putting the name Donald in there, so I told everyone, please tweet that to @Wilw, and people are fucking doing it.
Travis: That's amazing.
Chris hardwick: So, if you find the guy singing a very poor rendition of Stand by Me to Donald Trump, please send it to Wil Wheaton, he'll love it! Favorite thing in the world!
Matt: You heard it, guys. Critters' call to action. Make it happen.
Chris hardwick: #FeelTheGern.
Liam: CritterStrong.
Sam: Feel the Gern.
Matt: All right, well, guys. Chris, thank you so much for coming and hanging out with us.
Chris hardwick: Thank you, this was so much fun!
Taliesin: A week without crying!
Travis: Feel the Gern!
Chris hardwick: The best DM in the world! This is a wonderful party, and you're all fantastic. Thank you so much. I'm not even upset that you stole my broom.
Laura: Don't judge me, Scanlan, you didn't see me do it!
Sam: I didn't! I didn't!
Laura: Sam's just judging.
Sam: I'm judging you, Laura Bailey. (laughter)
Matt: There is a definite distinction.
Liam: Don't worry, everyone will judge you when you take it out and use it for the first time.
Sam: Vex is fine. Laura Bailey? Awful.
Travis: She's wanted to fly so much.
Liam: Beat him by one.
Matt: Well, thank you all so very much for watching tonight. Hope you enjoyed tonight's episode. We return next Thursday, 7PM Pacific time once again to pick up the next length of Vox Machina's journey. Everyone, show your love on Twitter to Chris, @hardwick. Thank you again for coming and being an amazing wizard for all of us. And is it Thursday yet? See some of you guys tomorrow, and if not, next week.
Travis: Peace out!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons. So, welcome. I know we had a two-week hiatus. We had some birthdays-- in fact, the twins had a birthday. (cheering)
Matt: Awesome. A lot of really amazing community art came out of it, because you guys are ridiculous, and we'll probably see some of that at the break today. But before we kick into the game, let's get through our announcements for the evening while we also wait for Mr. Sam Riegel, Scanlan, who I think we all can consider is pretty important to tonight's events, seeing as how he's currently being digested in the belly of the dragon.
Laura: Oh shit!
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: That didn't happen.
Matt: Yes it did. Yes it did. No. So. Starting off our announcements for the evening: first off, I am going to be flying out bright and early tomorrow morning to A-Kon in Dallas. I'll be out there doing panels and signings with a bunch of other great guests. I understand the same weekend is also Dallas Comic Con, because what the fuck, Dallas? At which Mary and Steve are there also, so don't choose: come to both! No.
Travis: Wade the waters.
Matt: Exactly. But I'll be doing signings, panels, and meeting a bunch of you Critters that are out in that area, so come by and say hi this weekend. And if not, go say hi to Steve and Mary, wherever that happens, in the lesser part of Dallas. I don't know if it is, I just like--
Travis: Yeah, there's a lesser part of Dallas, totally, over with the lesser-- are you guys throwing up because of how nervous you are?
Laura: What? No. Oh, my dice! Where are my dice?!
Matt: Where are your dice?
Laura: I'm so nervous, I don't even have my dice!
Travis: I'll go find them, I'll go find them.
Matt: Travis is going to get them. Wow. Two weeks to stew on this and it's already falling apart.
Liam: This is the exact icy, steely demeanor that I depend on.
Laura: Oh my god, are they in there?
Matt: While he looks for those--
Taliesin: I have extras, if you need some.
Matt: I do want to also say the newest Dear Abby article series for Critical Role characters went up-- or goes up tomorrow, right?
Marisha: Tomorrow, Fridays.
Matt: Friday. And whose is that one?
Marisha: Who goes up next?
Laura: What? Who goes up what next?
Matt: The next Dear Abby?
Laura: Oh, I think it's me!
Matt: Oh! Then we'll have Vex tomorrow coming up. See her answering questions to various distraught people throughout the realms of Exandria, and her I'm sure very astute--
Laura: I'm a really good giver of advice. I learned that about myself.
Ashley: It's true.
Liam: More about quantity than quality? Maybe?
Matt: Possibly. This is very true. So look for that tomorrow on geekandsundry.com, that'll be fun and exciting. Also, for those who didn't catch it yesterday, we had an awesome event at Meltdown Comics with the official Dungeons & Dragons crew announcing: one, their new storyline, which is the Storm King's Thunder, I think is what it's called. Really awesome, bringing the giants back into the world with a very fleshed-out story. I'm super excited about it, and keep tabs on that whenever that comes out, should be in the next few months, I think. I've seen some stuff behind-the-scenes and it looks really, really cool. But as part of that event yesterday, we also kicked off and announced a new video series campaign that I'm doing with the actual Wizards of the Coast Dungeons & Dragons team. Me and Chris Perkins wrote and designed together a story that I fleshed out and am running for a series of celebrity guests, one of which is our fantastic Ashley Johnson there.
Ashley: Hey!
Laura: You're a celebrity!
Marisha: You're a celebrity!
Matt: That was pretty great, guys. I'm not going to lie, that was pretty legit.
Liam: Just keep vamping. Keep vamping until the bard gets here.
Matt: That's right, we're waiting on Scanlan to get here. Other guests include Utkarsh, Shelby, Jonah-- I wrote all the first names down because the last names, some of them were hard to pronounce, but you can look up the actual announcements to get the full names. I'm really bad at this. It's been two weeks, give me a break.
Liam: You're busy. You're busy.
Matt: Nah! I've got so much free time. But it's going to be a great group, and I look forward to announcing it soon on when those will begin to air throughout the summer, because it's going to be a lot of fun. And I get to play in Forgotten Realms, which is something I've wanted to do again for a long time, and hope I don't mess up all the existing fantastic lore that Ed Greenwood has developed since he-- oh, are you okay, Laura?
Laura: No, I really feel like I'm going to throw up.
Travis: There's literally up-chuck going to happen. Just do it in a little thing and I'll feed it back to you like a little bird
Liam: Just go in there.
Laura: (retching noise) I threw up so many dice!
Travis: I'll talk about our sponsor this week.
Matt: You want to jump into that? Yeah, so we have a new sponsor coming in, sponsoring this episode of Critical Role this evening. (cheering)
Matt: So Travis, you want to take it away?
Travis: Our amazing sponsor this week is Backblaze. Backblaze is an amazing, unlimited cloud backup company for your Mac and PC, for just five dollars a month, it's incredible. We have an amazing representative from Backblaze in the studio. He's a crazy, crazy uber-fan. Yev, wave to me baby, blow me a kiss. He's incredible.
Laura: You should check out his Twitter page because he has printed out Flat Mercer and he's chronicling his adventures, and I'm pretty proud of it.
Travis: Yes! We're on you, we're talking about Backblaze right now.
Sam: Hey guys. Backblaze is a great service. (laughter)
Sam: It offers unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just five dollars a month. They're supporting the show tonight. I was saying this in the car on the way over. (laughter)
Matt: Well, please continue, we're not stopping you.
Sam: Guys, no shit, I just installed it yesterday on my home computer. It's currently backing up right now. It's an online file backup system for all your stuff. Your documents, your media, your Critical Role fanart, your videos of Scanlan singing things. There's no gimmicks or additional charges, it's just five dollars a month, and! You don't want to go to Backblaze.com, you want to go to backblaze.com/criticalrole, where you can get a fully-featured 15-day trial.
Travis: How many days, Sam?
Sam: 15 days, free! If you like it, keep getting it, pay five bucks a month, that's nothing. Or if you don't, whatever, it doesn't bother me. But it's only for Critters, and also if you go to backblaze.com/criticalrole right now, you'll see pictures of us, quotes from us. It's actually really cute.
Taliesin: Yeah, it was pretty cute.
Sam: And I am such a supporter of these guys that I even wrote a song for them.
Marisha: What?
Sam: It's very short. Okay.
Matt: Please, go ahead.
Sam: (singing) I'm backing up in Backblaze of glory! Take me now, download the truth. I'm backing up-- okay, that's it. (cheering)
Sam: I need a drink now.
Matt: You did good Sam, you did good.
Laura: There's some Guinness in the fridge.
Matt: It's been cool having sponsors come to the show, partially because they all come to us from being fans of the actual show, and that's the driving force behind this, so we want to make sure that things are on-brand from people who are genuinely interested in our community and have things to offer that'll be useful. I can say this as I have a web series I directed many years ago and spent a whole year doing, I lost all the files because of the hard drive that I had-- the external hard drive failed, and I don't have any of those anymore. And so since then I've been very, very careful about backing everything up. So this service would have been really helpful back then. So don't make the same mistakes I did. There Will Be Brawl only lives as final video files. It kills me. I couldn't even fix stuff. Still have the watermark on the last three videos for the Escapist that I can't remove. Anyway. Learn from my mistakes. So! Do we have anything else any of you folks want to announce?
Laura: E3's next week!
Matt: E3 is next week.
Laura: Oh wait, no it's not. It's two weeks from now.
Matt: No, it's two weeks from now.
Laura: It's two weeks from now. I'm sorry.
Matt: I believe nothing coming out of that mouth now!
Taliesin: E3 is two weeks from now, and I'm also going to be at Amazing Comic Con Vegas two weeks from now. And Signal Boost is currently in its second week, which is hilarious, and amazing, and you should totally check it out because it's weird.
Marisha: Yeah. You're like the most interesting man in the world.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: It's fantastic.
Laura: I've always thought that about you, Taliesin.
Taliesin: Oh. Thanks. I'm now... yeah. I'm going to die today, thank you. (laughter)
Laura: No you're not!
Travis: Pike's got us covered. Right, Pike?
Matt: All right, great. So, without further ado, and no further delaying the inevitable--
Travis: You got a little something on your--
Matt: Little thing on my nose, right there?
Travis: You might need to go the bathroom, check it out.
Matt: No, it's great. So let's go ahead and roll the intro and start playing Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: So. Continuing where we left off two weeks ago. The intrepid party of adventurers known as Vox Machina, after recently freeing the town of Westruun from being occupied and ruled by the roving Herd of the Storm, which Grog once hailed from, cut down their brutal leader Kevdak and temporarily restored power to a combination of himself and Kevdak's son, Zanror. An accord was made between the two of you to agree to go after and destroy the ancient black dragon Umbrasyl, a member of the Chroma Conclave, and marked for you to eventually destroy anyway, but who had currently made a deal with the Herd in exchange for goods, gold, and ruling over the town, would let them live and be essentially undisturbed, seemingly. You gathered an army, you forged a plan, and an ambush was set for the next time the dragon swooped down from atop the mountain Gatshadow to retrieve its package. At this time, the trap was sprung, the dragon held fast by hooks and chains, a giant metallic trap designed and orchestrated by Percival, and everything was going great. The dragon had sustained quite a bit of damage and seemed to be in a rough place until it broke free and left much of the Herd fallen, dissolving and screaming. Also, Scanlan and Vax Dimension Door'd into the inside of the dragon and have spent a number of rounds now deciding how to get out of it maybe?
Sam: Tiny Vax. Tiny Vax.
Matt: Tiny Vax. Thanks to a potion that does that. You managed to go ahead and put in an Immovable Rod within its stomach, which held it up for a moment before it decided to truly gain the advantage it needed to escape the circumstance, allowed it to tear through its body, as well as an arrow that was shot by Vex towards her brother, in hopes of-- I don't know, being a signal of hope or to put him out of his misery? I'm still trying to figure it out. At this point in time, Umbrasyl took to the sky and began to coast off towards Gatshadow, seemingly the domain that it's carved for itself in this region. On its way out, Grog had thrown his newly acquired Bloodaxe and his Chain of Returning into the dragon, left it, and is now being dragged behind it now, dangling as it flies off. And that, my friends, is where we kick back into the story.
Travis: That's when they knew they fucked up. (laughter)
Matt: So we have, as you guys-- Grog, your feet leave the ground as you swing forward, unable by the momentum pushing forward to keep up with the sheer speed of this dragon and its size, its mass, its full stretched wings, it is far faster than any of you expected and it whooshes off towards the mountaintop. You, just looking behind as the ground just fades further and further away. The rest of you, Vox Machina, seeing this happen, see essentially half of your friends, your party, only one of them visible, now beyond your reach. With that being said, for this circumstance, let's pick up where we were on the initiative order between you three.
Laura: Just straight into it!
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I'm ready.
Matt: We left at the right time for that, guys.
Liam: I cannot feel the lower half of my body. (laughter)
Matt: Here, how about this? Because I can't find the original initiative order, we'll just say for this circumstance we'll roll initiative based on what action's going to happen here. So we're going to have you three roll initiative.
Travis: Come on, lucky dice. I get advantage on that.
Sam: I got 12.
Liam: 13.
Travis: 13 also.
Laura: Oh jeez.
Sam: Starting off right.
Matt: All right. So. As it crests into the sky (whoosh), blackish dragon blood dripping from wounds, you can feel every single tension of its upper torso muscles with each swoop of the wings crushing against you in this rhythmic pattern. What little bit of air currently has been placed at the top of the stomach, based on your Thunderwave, is all you have to maintain any semblance of hope. You, there's an arrow in darkness. However, Umbrasyl at this point, who does go first in this order, is just concentrating on survival and continues gliding upward. You hear a rumble within the inside of the body, and the essence of a growling, angry voice creeps through. "These foul creatures. Get out of me!" (straining sound) I need you guys to both roll strength saving throws right now.
Laura: He's trying to puke you up?
Sam: Or just crush us.
Liam: Strength saving? Nine.
Sam: Yeah, not great. 15.
Matt: 15. You manage to put your arms against the side, and using whatever forceful arcane cantrips to keep the walls at bay before it actually finds you, and you slip out in time. You, however, do suffer six points of bludgeoning damage as the muscles once again tense against you. Umbrasyl is very much aware that there are now living things inside the stomach squirming around and as the muscles relax, the voice just growls again, "Try all you want. Don't worry. I can eat you now or later."
Liam: Can't hear you.
Matt: So. We had two 13s and a--
Sam: 12.
Matt: 12. All right. So Grog, Vax, what are you guys doing?
Liam: I'm taking--
Matt: The Bramblewood is now beneath you, you're heading towards the mountain, you can see the edge of the forest now.
Travis: Maybe I go first, just in case something--
Liam: Yeah, go for it.
Travis: The Bramblewood? I'm holding on, right? With the Titanstone Knuckles. Whereabouts is the axe lodged? Can I see where the chain is attached to?
Matt: You can see it curving up ahead of you and with how high the sun is in the sky, it's around noon, there's a heavy bit of shadow, and at this distance? Make a perception check.
Travis: (laughs) That went one and then a 13. Minus-- zero. 13.
Matt: 13. It seems to be somewhere around the base of the tail, like where the tail meets the rest of the actual body itself, the torso area.
Laura: It's in his butt.
Matt: No, it's not quite in his butt, it's more in his side.
Travis: How high am I?
Matt: Looking down? Numbers are hard for you to pick up. It's a long way.
Travis: A long way.
Matt: It's a long way. Like-- yeah.
Travis: Well. Only one way to go. And that's up. I would like to try and pull myself up the chain towards Umbrasyl.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: Athletics or strength?
Matt: Athletics. Which is better, technically.
Laura: It's a strength saving thing, so--
Matt: Yeah, it's strength plus your proficiency bonus.
Travis: Oh! I get an advantage or?
Matt: You get your proficiency bonus. You're no longer raging, because this is more fear-struck at this point.
Travis: Oh, 14 plus five-- 19.
Matt: 19, yeah. You begin to ascend the chain. You get closer to it, and you can now see the axe itself is embedded and is starting to wiggle and pull out. So you're making your way up the chain with the full round at this point, you're almost to it, but that's going to be the rest of your action this turn.
Travis: Yeah, okay!
Matt: So what are you doing?
Liam: I'm taking the dragon sword and I am shoving it along the angle of the arrow that's coming in toward it, to try to go parallel.
Matt: Okay. The arrowhead is still poking through--
Liam: Through, and I'm sending it along that line.
Matt: Okay, okay. All right. Go ahead and make a general dexterity check. To see if you're able to--
Liam: Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: Okay. Using the essence of where the actual shaft of the arrow has pierced the hide and is stuck through, you take the blade and use your understanding of precision weapons and implements to find the slight opening. And the blade thankfully is very thin. Slide it through with minimal resistance. You can see the muscles are still pushing against it, but the already preset wound from the arrow does guide it through, and you manage to go straight to the hilt, and it's found its way all the way through the wound. No additional damage is dealt necessarily, but it has gone--
Liam: This does not count as an attack on the creature?
Matt: You said you wanted to put it through an existing hole.
Liam: The hole is this thick.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Like a straw, and the blade is this, that's not piercing damage? There's no piercing damage. Whatever you want.
Matt: Do you want to roll an attack for this?
Liam: Yes, I want it to be an attack.
Matt: Right, now you would make the attack as the blade. The idea being that you wanted to guide it through the hole.
Liam: I'm going to use one of my Lucks. I've got two left. Better.
Matt: Didn't you use any Luck for the battle?
Liam: I used one last time.
Matt: Right, so you have two left.
Liam: 12 plus strength, which is low, is 14. The dragon sword-- is the dragon sword plus anything, guys? I don't know that I have the--
Matt: Plus one.
Liam: Plus one. All right.
Matt: Yeah, and then it does additional damage against dragons.
Liam: Oh, and I have to roll-- I'll just say I missed. For my bonus action, I'm going to slide the dagger up along the same line and try to widen that gap.
Matt: Okay. This roll will be at disadvantage.
Liam: The last one was too, which is why I just scrubbed it.
Matt: Right, right, right. Go ahead and make the secondary attack.
Liam: No.
Matt: Yeah. Okay, so, the blade is in there and it has found its way through the existing wound, but you don't quite have the strength to actually wrench it enough to do any real, serious damage as it is a very, very hardy and well-defended creature from its natural mass. The fleshy interior of a dragon is almost as dense and as protected as the armored hide on the outside, and that's one thing you weren't counting on when entering its form.
Liam: And what did I just do, though, with the dragon sword, did I widen the hole?
Matt: You've put the blade through the hole and so now you have that blade lodged in, you can then use that to try and widen it in successive turns in itself and that will prevent you from having disadvantage on the attacks with that blade going forward, because it's already in a soft place and you can just wedge it, but it's going to be a strength attack for each of those rounds. The dagger unfortunately, you just can't find any purchase at that point there in the time given, because of the movement and the squishing. You do also suffer an additional seven points of crushing damage.
Liam: Okay, and I forgot. One other thing I want to do-- I have movement too, can I use my legs to push as hard as I can forward a foot or something? I know with movement over difficult terrain it's halved, and I'm in the most difficult terrain.
Matt: You are in the most difficult terrain there probably is.
Liam: But if I use my movement could I shove and go like a foot towards the outside, half a foot or anything?
Matt: Pushing towards the wound?
Liam: Pushing in. Using my legs to go--
Matt: Okay. I would say that would be part of your attack next round. Actual movement within, you would be able to move a few feet but you'd have to release the blade to do so. Any actual blade pushing forward would be your next action, so hold off for the next round. Scanlan, what you got?
Sam: Oi. So I'm in a beast. As we all know, intestines are my favoured terrain-- (laughter)
Travis: I remember him saying that years ago!
Matt: This is true!
Laura: Back when we first made these characters, I remember you saying that.
Sam: So I held up that rod, clicked it, and then it was pulled out of the body pretty close to where I am right now. When it went, did I see air? Did I see daylight, when it went out of there?
Matt: It was very small. It's the equivalent of a bullet going through, because the rod when it punched through it didn't-- it's a very thin, elongated object, so it pierced through like a metal rod at a very high speed.
Liam: So the dragon got very lucky and it went through like that, and not like that.
Matt: If it would have hit-- at whatever angle it would be, even then, it's only that wide and it would still puncture a tiny slit, and due to the density of both the muscles of the creature and its body, it took damage and there's a little bit of blood coming from the wound, you imagine, but it's not like it's going to leave an open, cavernous hole.
Sam: It's a cut.
Matt: Yeah, it's a cut.
Sam: Got it.
Matt: But you did see where it (tearing noise) through.
Sam: And when it went out, I didn't see any daylight or anything. Just disappeared.
Matt: You just saw it (tearing noise) through the creature's stomach. You do see a little bit of blood beginning to pour out of where the wound was.
Sam: Okay. Oh boy.
Travis: Do it, baby.
Sam: I don't know, I got nothing. All right, I'll just try something and we'll see if it works and then I'll try something else next time. I won't die in one round, right? I'm going to Polymorph into a Tri-- not-a-ceratops. Into a small, poisonous snake.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: And I'm going to go straight into that wound.
Matt: Okay, well, before that happens you do take four points of acid damage from the stomach before you take the form, because that would be the top of the round. So, at which point you turn into a small poisonous snake, now floating amongst the acids, and find your way along the surface. And you're heading towards the wound?
Sam: I'm going into the wound.
Matt: Okay, all right--
Sam: With a swim speed of 30!
Matt: Right, you do. (laughter)
Matt: Let me check.
Sam: But I don't know if it's swimming, it's more squeezing.
Matt: Through the acid, it's swimming. Once you get to the actual wound, this is more squeezing. And that's going to be more of a strength-based element. So that being the case here, a poisonous snake, I'm going to need you to go ahead and roll a strength check to push against the wound.
Sam: Sure, man. This is a strong snake.
Laura: Really?
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: Which, just as a heads up, is a minus four to its strength, so that's technically a negative three.
Sam: (bink) Going well, guys!
Matt: Yeah. You just dive in headfirst and with all your snaky might, you slither and slither and slither, just getting nowhere. No headway. This is bad. (laughter)
Liam: Why don't you bite it, dude?
Sam: Oh yeah! Sure, I'll take a bite.
Liam: Poisonous bite.
Matt: Sure, go for it. Roll for an attack.
Sam: 14 plus-- I have no idea.
Matt: Plus five.
Sam: Hey! That's a 19. That doesn't hit.
Matt: A 19? The inside of the stomach is not as well-armored as outer parts of the body. A 19 would hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Sam: What do I roll?
Matt: This would be-- oh no, you don't roll. It takes one piercing damage. (laughter)
Sam: Guys, we knocked it down a point!
Matt: And it has to make a constitution saving throw versus your poison. That's an eight plus 14, at a DC of ten. So yeah, it doesn't take any additional-- oh, it takes half damage. So go ahead and roll 2d4.
Sam: Ooh! Seven.
Matt: It takes three points of poison damage. (laughter)
Sam: And it is considered grappled. Okay. Plan A, cross it off the list. (laughter)
Matt: All right. Top of the round. Okay, so, Umbrasyl is still flying up, looking down at its form, is glancing about...
Travis: Don't see me! Don't see me!
Laura: You're in its butt. How can it see you?
Matt: Grog. As you're holding onto the axe, you see before you, just pass underneath the leg and the front arms that are reaching down, this giant, dark, looming projection comes down and looks right towards you. The horned front of the dragon as Umbrasyl stares right into your face and goes, "There you are." (draws in breath, exhales) And unleashes a torrent of acid towards you. I need you to go ahead and make-- this is going to roll a dexterity saving throw. You have disadvantage.
Travis: I do?
Matt: Because you're currently holding onto the chain, but I believe you have advantage on them because you are a barbarian.
Travis: I have Danger Sense. So just one roll?
Matt: Yeah. So just roll.
Travis: That's not great. 11.
Ashley: Can I-- do I see them?
Matt: No! They are way over-- they're like a tiny little dragon speck in the distance. We'll get to you guys here in just a moment, but their situation is a little more dire and immediate, so I have to figure out what's going on with them right now.
Laura: What if we could've chased after them? Right away?
Matt: You can if you want to. Did you want to go after them?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: I would have chased after them, immediately, when it took off.
Matt: Okay, we'll get to that in just a minute. As it is-- the dragon's speed is it can fly 80 feet per round.
Laura: That's really fast, though.
Matt: Yeah, and it's making double-dash manoeuvring here, even at your fly speed on the broom--
Laura: What do great eagles have? Giant eagles, I think, have really fast speed too.
Matt: Let's check that real fast. Giant eagles--
Marisha: 80.
Matt: 80 feet. So the eagles are able to keep up. Do you want something that way?
Laura: So, if the eagles were to pick up somebody--
Matt: First off, Grog, you take 62 points of acid damage.
Travis: Nice.
Laura: Wait, you have acid resis-- no, you don't, because Keyleth-- it went away.
Travis: It went away?
Laura: Yeah, remember? Because she used--
Matt: She took damage and it dropped.
Marisha: I took damage, I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault. I lost concentration. Blame the dragon that did 40 damage.
Matt: So, as the stream pours past you, you feel your flesh burning, and elements of your skin are actually sloughing off and plummeting beneath you like a thick oatmeal.
Laura: Gross!
Matt: You still maintain your grip on the axe through sheer force of anger and willpower. Umbrasyl slows down a little bit in not doing the double-dash maneuver. That's going to end Umbrasyl's turn. So you sent the eagles after--
Laura: Well no, I wanted the eagles to pick up Pike and Percy.
Matt: So the eagles swing by--
Marisha: Wait, not yet. Stone! Stone!
Taliesin: Throw her the teleport stone!
Ashley: Gatestone! I pull it out of my bag. Pass it to her.
Taliesin: I'm going to hop on an eagle.
Laura: I literally am sending the eagles as this is happening and I dash out of the tree on my broom, and go for the Immovable Rod, just long enough to stop and grab it and keep taking off after the dragon.
Matt: Okay, so you retrieve the rod, grab it, and head off in that direction. So we now have both of you, on eagle-back, heading off, with you trailing behind as you can't quite travel at the same speed as the eagles.
Taliesin: I'm going to try and clear my gun while I'm up there, too.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: You've got a ride. Animal handling. I'm going to drop and I'll start focusing on the Gatestone.
Taliesin: So, situated, I'm just going to try and clear the gun and see if it's an easy fix.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Nope. Gun's broken.
Laura: It's broken?
Taliesin: Yeah, gun's broken. I've got another gun, but big gun's broken.
Matt: Yeah, Bad News is out. All right. As you're flying off you're having a hard time with the bumpy ride, as this eagle also has been near death due to being partially dissolved by the acidic attack from the dragon before. It wasn't the acid, it was something else that wrecked it.
Laura: No, it was a bite or a claw.
Matt: Yeah, I think it was a bite or a claw, because the acid would've destroyed it. So the eagle's heavily wounded, and due to it shuddering and trying to keep up it just causes you to end up bending a portion of the actual weapon.
Taliesin: Damn it. I put it away.
Matt: All right. So you guys are keeping up. You're concentrating on the stone.
Marisha: One minute, baby.
Matt: Bringing us back now. Grog, you're recovering from this attack.
Travis: I look down and I see my beautiful body tattoos melting away like instant oatmeal. Not even like the nice apples and cinnamon kind, it's like the maple brown sugar that no one--
Laura: That's my favorite kind of oatmeal.
Travis: Nobody likes that; you're alone in this. And it makes me so angry that I go into a rage?
Matt: Do recall, you do have one point of exhaustion since your frenzied rage did wear off beforehand.
Travis: Right, yeah.
Matt: So you go into a rage.
Laura: Oh but we have Heroes' Feast, is that good?
Matt: It doesn't help with that, no.
Travis: All right. So I go in a rage, and I would like to try and continue climbing up the remainder of the distance to Umbrasyl.
Matt: Okay. Athletics check, with advantage.
Travis: That was a one.
Laura: Oh, that's way better!
Travis: That's much better. That's a 29.
Matt: You find your way up, grabbing onto the edge of the tail, and you actually pull yourself up onto the base of the tail. You're on the back of Umbrasyl right now. The chain is still currently attached to its side.
Marisha: Khaleesi!
Travis: Mother of dragons! Do I have any more movement?
Matt: It's taken your whole turn to really get up there. Are you going to dislodge the Bloodaxe, or leave it there?
Travis: I'm going to dislodge it, because it was already so weak.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and make your check to remove it. It's a DC 12, I think.
Travis: That's a one. Yep.
Matt: You pull on the chain, but the reason it managed to hold your weight this whole ride up was it was wedged pretty well into its armored hide. And thank god it did. However, at this point, it's proving that that is now coming back to haunt you, as it is really hard to pull it from where it's stuck in the dragon. That's going to be the end of your turn. Vax.
Liam: First turn I'm going to use the dragon blade to attack and slice downward and try to wedge that hole open a little bigger.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That hits. Well, I don't know if it hits. Nine plus my strength for this sword, right, not dexterity?
Matt: Correct. I'm letting this one be a finesse.
Liam: I probably hit him before. So that's a 25.
Matt: 25? You carve an opening in the side about a foot and a half in full length there. As you drag it you hear a roaring. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: It's 1d8 plus your dex--
Liam: Yeah, I know, I got that written down, thank you. 16.
Matt: 16? All righty.
Liam: And then, this is a game rules thing. Grog's within five feet of this thing and I'm no longer at disadvantage. Or am I?
Matt: This is less rules and more narrative. You don't understand the body or where you really are in the body of the dragon. He's not threatening the creature right now. If anything, it's potentially threatening you. This would not be a sneak attack.
Liam: I'm not arguing, I'm asking what's possible.
Matt: No worries.
Liam: I'll use the dagger to hit. Am I at disadvantage with the dagger still?
Matt: I'd say yes, because the only reason you didn't have disadvantage with the other blade is because it was within an existing wound and then you pulled back.
Liam: Then I miss.
Matt: Okay, the other dagger, you go ahead and stab again, this time it hits a dense part of muscle and does sink in, but not enough to do any serious damage from the inside.
Liam: And there's air queefing in and out of this slot? (laughter)
Matt: A little bit, yes. It's about that wide. You staying there?
Liam: Yes. No. I'm going to slide my body and try to stick head and dagger arm out of it and hang half in and half out, if possible.
Matt: Yeah. Go ahead and make a straight strength check.
Liam: 13.
Matt: 13? That's fine. Thankfully, the DC's lower because you managed to carve the large wound in. You plant your feet against the other muscle wall that you are between and you push off and get yourself through. And in the most awkward, tiny birth, just above your armpits, your head and arm emerge out the side. Immediately a gust of wind hits your hand as you realize and look down: you are hundreds of feet above the ground. Bramblewood right beneath you. But you are partially out of the dragon.
Laura: You can breathe!
Liam: (gasps for air)
Matt: Take a deep breath. You take three points of crushing damage as the muscle walls around you are still squeezing in on you in your current placement. That ends your turn. You! At the top of your round, your snake takes acid damage. Only one point of acid damage. How many hit points does your poisonous snake have?
Sam: I don't think he has very many.
Matt: It may have less than one hit point, in which case, you're just going to turn right back into Scanlan.
Sam: I think he's dead.
Matt: Let's find out. It has two hit points!
Sam: Oh god! Oh no, but wait, I took damage last round, too.
Matt: That was before you transformed. It was at the top of your round.
Sam: Hey, I'm still a snake! (laughter)
Sam: Well, I'm not going to try that any more. If I drop form, is that my whole round?
Matt: No, you just let it go.
Sam: I'm going to drop the snake. Snake was a try and fail.
Matt: It was a good idea. Just not a very strong snake.
Sam: I drop the snake, try to get that little bubble of air (gasps), and I'll fucking cast Bigby's Hand.
Matt: Okay! So, using that little pocket of air, you bring your hand up, you do your quick somatic components, shouting the phrase, and Bigby's Hand appears and is currently being squished between some of the walls of the stomach.
Sam: Can he move at all?
Matt: Yeah!
Sam: Okay. I would like to fist the wound. Jam it, find a finger and-- how you like that?
Taliesin: You're fingering the wound. Okay! (laughter)
Sam: This wound will never heal.
Matt: I don't-- yeah. (laughter)
Sam: So would it be a forceful hand?
Matt: This would be a very forceful hand. This would be the definition of Bigby's Forceful Hand. Go ahead and roll an athletics check for Bigby, which is strength 28, so add plus eight to the roll.
Sam: 12?!
Matt: Total of 12?
Sam: Yes!
Matt: The finger pushes partway in and gets about halfway up to its second knuckle. (laughter)
Matt: It is just chilling right there.
Sam: This is so embarrassing! Wow! (laughter)
Matt: I'm blushing, man!
Liam: All about phrasing.
Sam: Wow! Okay!
Matt: All right, that's your turn.
Sam: I have movement, right?
Matt: You do have movement, yes.
Sam: I can't move anywhere! I have climbing stuff with me. Can I move my arms at all?
Matt: You can move your arms, yeah.
Sam: I would like to take out a grappling hook and grab onto the inside lining of the stomach.
Matt: Okay, make a strength check.
Sam: Nope! Six!
Matt: Six. You take it and (ting, swish). It just slips along the very heavy mucous material lined interior of the stomach. There's a little scrape line, but that's about it.
Sam: I can't do anything! It's great.
Matt: Top of Umbrasyl's round. Breath weapon does not return. However, is going to use one of its legendary actions and attempt to beat its wings to shake you off of it, Grog.
Laura: Are you raging?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Which I have advantage on. 18.
Matt: 18. You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage, which is reduced by half, so you're only taking seven. However, you are knocked prone.
Travis: (laughing) On his back.
Matt: Yes, which causes you to begin tumbling off the back of the tail. The wind of it-- (thump thump)
Travis: Shit!
Matt: The chain of returning is still attached to you, however, and as you go tumbling off the back of the tail, it catches you, and you are now swinging towards the back of the creature, of the dragon now, back where you started. Only the dragon is very aware of your presence. But you didn't plummet to your death!
Travis: That's good!
Matt: That was the end of your turn. Now it's the top of Umbrasyl's turn.
Sam: These dragons are hard to kill!
Matt: Yeah, imagine that! At this point, now, as this has gone on for a little while as you guys began to ascend and it went upward, it's now partway up the mountainside. You can see the forest has gotten more sparse. There are trees scattered across the top of the mountaintop.
Liam: We're close to Gatshadow already?
Matt: You can see it. You're not there, but it's going across the forest top and it's coming towards the actual mountain base. It hasn't quite ascended it completely.
Laura: What about giant eagles with people on them?
Matt: They're keeping in tandem with it. They're not able to quite catch up entirely, just due to the nature of the fast dragon.
Liam: Arrow range?
Matt: Not for her, unfortunately, no.
Taliesin: We're not within 400 feet of it, are we?
Matt: You, at this point, jumping on, would just be on the outside of the range if you wanted to try. You're at disadvantage on these attacks because you are on the back of a flying, wounded bird.
Laura: Don't let the bird get hit by Umbrasyl!
Taliesin: Fuck it. Taking a shot. At least taking one shot to see what happens. Ooh yeah. Natural 20.
Matt: With disadvantage.
Travis: Do it again.
Taliesin: 18, that'll do. 27 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Oh, and he still has-- no, I lost Hex.
Matt: You lost Hex, yeah.
Liam: You're doing great, de Rolo, come on! Keep your head in the game.
Taliesin: 14 points of damage.
Matt: Gun goes off. You hear a whizz go by your ear as the bullet hits the side of Umbrasyl. (grunting) The head looks back towards the rest of you, now approaching at a distance.
Laura: Do not let the bird get hit! You will plummet to your fucking death.
Taliesin: I'm going to spend the rest of my attack pushing the eagle down to fly at tree level.
Matt: So, at the top of Umbrasyl's turn, as you guys are pushing forward and you're still concentrating, the dragon growls under its breath. (spellcasting) You can't hear it. You're too far away.
Ashley: She can read lips!
Laura: I'm so far away! I just want to know what he's saying.
Matt: The outer view of the dragon shimmers for a second and then vanishes from sight.
Liam: Are we visible?
Matt: No.
Liam: We're not like Wonder Woman inside the jet? What about my hand hanging out?
Matt: Yeah. You see the dragon.
Sam: What about Grog?
Matt: Grog is dangling from nothing right now. Grog is kiting through the air.
Taliesin: You have Hunter's Mark.
Ashley: So we can see Grog?
Matt: In theory, yeah, if you can keep a bead on him.
Travis: I'm enlarged.
Matt: A very heavy Grog.
Laura: Is he Hunter's Marked still--
Matt: He would be. You haven't taken a lot of damage yet, or at all.
Laura: I haven't taken any damage.
Matt: Then you still have Hunter's Mark on him, yeah. Continues upward. That comes to the next part. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I had one question. I drank that Potion of Speed. It hastes me for a minute. How many rounds is a minute?
Matt: That has gone away, unfortunately.
Travis: Well, there's nothing to do but to climb back up the chain!
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: Up the chain! Fucking weiner snap. 15.
Matt: 15? All righty. You manage to pull yourself halfway up the chain. You get back to where you were towards the base of the tail. That's the extent of your round there. The wind resistance itself, you can see the axe itself, after you tried to tug it forward, did bring it a little loose. So its position is still a little precarious.
Travis: Might as well say something cool. I can do this all day! I'm really not confident.
Matt: All right. Vax.
Liam: I would like to use my movement, if I can, with the blade I used to go this way, and I cut a big foot-long thing. I want to try to use my movement to reverse the direction of the blade and stab inward.
Matt: It would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack. It wouldn't use your movement. It would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack with it. It wouldn't use your movement.
Liam: My dagger hand's the one that's out. I want to try to maneuver the sword around and stab inward and keep cutting bacon in here. I want to attack the dragon, but still from the inside with the hand that's inside.
Matt: Okay. You're in a weird position now where the blade's at your side, so pulling away from the body, there's very little strength to pull that way, since you punched through the wound. So you're essentially holding the blade right here.
Liam: Then if I did this, can I just continue to saw in the same direction and do an attack?
Matt: You'd be at a disadvantage on it.
Liam: Visual. I don't know what I'm seeing.
Matt: T You stabbed through, you cut a wound. Holding that blade, you punched through, and the thickness is about most of your body's length. So most of your body is still in the wound. You've just barely pushed through, and you're still holding the blade back this way. There's no real strength to attack from this position because you're being squished.
Liam: Then I'm going to attack at disadvantage with the dragon blade, and then I'm going to stab with the dagger that's outside.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Dragon blade on the inside rolled a 15.
Matt: 15?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: There's just not enough strength to get it though. You try and pull upward and the blade comes loose, comes towards your body, but doesn't actually find any additional part of the muscle to cut through.
Liam: Dagger on the outside is 21.
Matt: 21? Just scrapes across the hide. Not strong enough to pierce it from the outside. You do also take one point of bludgeoning damage as the wound tenses around you once more. Scanlan!
Sam: For my bonus action, I'm going to fist the dragon again! Just going to jam it in there!
Matt: Roll an athletics check with plus eight.
Sam: 20!
Matt: 20! The hand pushes into the wound, causing it to tear open and rupture part of the stomach. As it punches through, temporarily leaving an open wound in the side of its stomach area, Bigby's Hand is partially outside the dragon now.
Sam: Great!
Matt: It takes 11 points of damage from the wound. And you currently have a little bit of light that's visible before the wound closes.
Sam: Before the wound closes.
Matt: The muscles re-tense. You watch it punch through and everything (gasp). It's the moment of impact.
Sam: I'm going to jump in the hole.
Matt: You leap in after Bigby's Hand just in the wake of it slamming into the side of the muscle of the stomach walls. In that one moment, you're rushing past, you can feel the actual muscles tensing behind you. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Dexterity saving throw. 18!
Matt: 18! Okay! You manage to leap behind Bigby's Hand and grab onto the side of it as the hand punches entirely out of the dragon's body, the wound slamming shut behind.
Sam: Oh god, I'm outside the dragon?!
Matt: You are now outside the dragon.
Sam: (screams) Shit!
Matt: Holding onto Bigby's Hand.
Sam: Is he flying? Does he stay still? What does he do?
Matt: He is flying.
Sam: He can fly?!
Matt: Bigby's Hand!
Sam: Not as fast as the dragon.
Matt: Bigby's Hand can move up to 60 feet, so no, it's slower than the dragon. Starting to drag a little bit behind as it's moving.
Sam: God. Okay! Hand can't do anything else, right?
Matt: No, that was its action. That's most of your turn, really, at this point. That was your movement to push through after the bonus attack, so you have your action. I'll give you your action.
Sam: You're not going to let me cast another spell, probably.
Matt: You have an action, so you could, technically. You look out as you punch through. You look down below you suddenly after you take a moment to look, and you can see part of Vax emerging from the side of the dragon. And then the whole dragon and Vax vanish.
Sam: Oh shit! Wait, I see Grog?
Matt: You do see Grog, dangling from the chain, slowly pulling his way up towards the back.
Travis: (screaming) Scanlan!
Sam: I'm holding onto the hand?
Travis: (screaming) What the fuck?!
Matt: You are now right there with Bigby's Hand. (laughter)
Sam: The Hand can't do anything else.
Matt: Not this turn, no.
Sam: Shit. I just got out of the dragon. I don't know what's going on. I didn't even know we were flying. I'm just going to shoot a Lightning Bolt at him.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Advantage on the dexterity saving throw. What's the DC of it? The DC of the Lightning Bolt?
Sam: It's my spell. It's not through the Hand Cone, I assume.
Matt: Nope, you are clutching both hands onto the side.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18. It makes the save. Roll damage, and it takes half damage.
Sam: 26.
Matt: 26. All right, so it takes 13 points of lightning damage. (blast) The bolt streaks upward, hitting the sides of the wound that you just came out of it, and arcs up the side of the body. Most of it is absorbed from the hefty, scaled hide of the black dragon, but it does (unhappy groan) roil with pain. You hear it yelling, and with a very slight shifting of light, you notice the dragon is still there, and you recognize this. This is an Invisibility spell. That ends your turn.
Sam: I guess so.
Matt: So, the rest of you guys, trying to keep up. The dragon's far out of range of anything you have, and it's just seems to be coasting as fast as it can out of the way, so you have nothing, I don't think, that can really go past a 300, 400 foot range. So you're just keeping on that eagle, holding on. You as well, you're behind the others, just slowly falling behind.
Laura: How fast can my broom go?
Matt: I think it's 50 feet. I can look it up again real fast. It's not a racing broom. Quidditch broom. I'll find it for you.
Laura: And my boots of haste don't do shit to a broom.
Matt: I'm going to look it up right now, just to let you know, so we can all relax.
Travis: It's the fastest model yet! I love Harry Potter.
Matt: I gather that. (laughter)
Matt: I love it, too. Broom of Flying. Flying speed is 50 feet. You can't even see it now. Grog's just become this little speck in the distance. All right, so as that's going on, are you doing anything?
Taliesin: I'm going to keep my eyes peeled on what I can see and try to keep up as best I can at treeline, like below.
Matt: Back to the top of the round. The dragon, Umbrasyl, now (wings flapping). Even you are being dragged behind nothing, you can hear the wings beating. You still have full sight of the dragon at this point. The voice growls out of its throat, "Fine. Let's see how well you hold on, insects!" It begins to spin and do a barrel roll. I need both of you, as also its muscles tense, to roll strength saving throws.
Travis: I have advantage on those.
Liam: Six.
Matt: Six?
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. You get swung around, the chain taking the brunt of all the weight across its back. (popping) Comes free. Thankfully, you were in an up arc, but you are now arcing in the air. You also get ejected from the wound from the muscles tensing behind, it almost squeezes you out. Before you can even get a grapple on, the dragon vanishes from sight and you're now falling backwards.
Liam: I'd like take a chance to say, here, that when I went into this dragon, I was lost, and a wanderer. As I am shat out its side, I come forth a paladin of the Raven Queen. I have multiclassed and leveled up. And the last thing I'm thinking as I shoot out this hole in its side is: if you have any wings to lend me, now is the time.
Matt: Okay. As you emerge from the body of Umbrasyl, there is a streak of shadow that scatters into a burst of darkened raven feathers that fill the air around you. You still plummet, but as a nature of your prayer, that brief moment of understanding, it appears there is some reaction. That'll be that element there.
Marisha: Where am I in my minute?
Matt: Oh, you're like 20 seconds in. 30 seconds in.
Ashley: Are they all falling?
Matt: You guys now watch as, suddenly, Grog and Vax just (rush of air). Vax appears out of nowhere and is falling. Scanlan's being held aloft by a distant Bigby's Hand, and Grog is arcing in the air. At that point now, Grog, Vax, what are you doing as you're falling backward?
Travis: I take out a case of fancy wine and-- (laughter)
Travis: I pull out a fancy robe, of which there are two, and pull it out. I'm going to drop the Bloodaxe. I'm going to grab both ends of the fancy robe and just make the shittiest parachute of all time.
Matt: (air puffs)
Travis: There ain't much else to do.
Marisha: Shitty G.I. Joes.
Matt: Yeah, it's like 25 cent quality, above you, Grog, as you squeeze your eyes and hold on. Plummeting down towards the Bramblewood. Vax.
Liam: Hey, I'm a brand new paladin. Lay on Hands, which is going to do fuck all for me, but is that a bonus action?
Matt: I believe it's an action.
Liam: An action? Okay. I'm going to cast Lay on Hands on myself. And I'm going throw my poison dagger at the dragon as I fall. That's a 23.
Matt: 23 does hit.
Liam: That is ten points of damage with poison on it. It's a DC of 15 for poison. I'm sure it makes it.
Matt: Yeah, it makes it. It would've had to roll a one to not make it, unfortunately.
Travis: Could I add one bonus thing at the end of mine?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Can I see Scanlan and Bigby's Hand at all? Or is the world just a clusterfuck?
Matt: Make a perception check, just glancing around you.
Travis: Four.
Matt: Four. No. You see earth beneath you, sky above, mountain to your left, and the inevitable plummet coming at you.
Liam: I'm thinking about my mother as I fall backward through space.
Sam: Distance between me and them?
Matt: Vax is about 20 feet from you, Grog's about 60, 70 feet from you.
Sam: What's the range of-- shit.
Taliesin: 50 feet.
Travis: Remember, we're going to be going the same direction.
Marisha: They're both falling, yeah. Vax will hit the ground first.
Sam: Vax will?
Travis: I'm higher.
Matt: The dragon's moved ahead to this point now since you guys have fallen off.
Sam: Is anyone higher than me?
Matt: Grog is. Vax is a little bit below you.
Sam: And he's not flying or anything, is he?
Matt: He's trying. He's holding a scrap piece of fabric that's just (rustling fabric).
Travis: I've seen Percy make shit, I can do it, too! (blows puffs of air)
Taliesin: You're doing very well. You're doing very well.
Sam: Wow. This didn't go well.
Marisha: I'm hoping you can hold on for a minute.
Sam: Okay. Yeah! I'm going to drop Bigby's-- 60 feet is not plummeting speed? I can't catch up to them as they fall?
Matt: Right now, you could catch up to one of them.
Sam: All right. Because Grog is over me, right?
Matt: Yeah, Grog is in an arc, so you would have to meet him as he fell.
Sam: I'll try to catch him then.
Matt: Okay, so you clutch onto Bigby's Hand and move as he plummets.
Sam: Shit, wait. Wait.
Matt: What are you doing? What are you doing, Scanlan?
Sam: Shit. Vax is below me, though.
Liam: He said you can get to one of them, so it's just a Sophie's Choice.
Sam: It's a Sophie's Choice.
Marisha: But who's on the lowest hit points?
Sam: Yeah, I would go for Grog if he's above me, with the hand.
Matt: Okay. The hand comes forward, sends out this cupping motion, the fingers below. You, eyes closed, clenching tight, (impact). All of a sudden, the wind stops, and it's like you're being held by your mother again, a memory you haven't recalled since you were a child. You open your eyes slowly, and you're still above the ground! Holy shit! But there's a giant purple hand around you and a very freaked out Scanlan clutching the outside.
Travis: Look what you did!
Sam: Hi, friend. Shit. We've got to go to Vax. I'll start moving us slowly down, I guess.
Matt: That was the turn to even get to him and catch him.
Sam: Then-- fuck.
Matt: You still have an action if you have anything.
Sam: I can't see the dragon anymore, right?
Matt: No. You have a vague idea of where it might be.
Marisha: Do you still have Polymorph?
Sam: Yeah, concentration.
Marisha: Fuck.
Sam: Yep. I mean, I can make Grog deaf so he won't hear us die. (laughter)
Matt: That's useful.
Taliesin: That seems like a really good use.
Sam: I got Grog. Fuck. Okay. I'm going to drop Bigby's Hand and Polymorph Grog into an eagle.
Matt: Okay. So, as you look over at Scanlan, with a big look of relief and thank you, he gives you a cursory look as the hand vanishes.
Travis: What. What?! (screams)
Sam: Holding on to him!
Matt: He grabs you real fast, and suddenly you have feathers! What the shit! And, strangely, you become smarter! As giant eagles have an intelligence of eight.
Liam: Quick, come up with a plan!
Travis: It's a new day, baby.
Sam: His brain is just geometry.
Matt: It's a Beautiful Mind moment in the middle of the sky. Suddenly you understand, the instinct hits you, and (whoosh). You have wings. You feel Scanlan's tiny hands grasping the back of your neck.
Sam: And I just yell at him, dive, motherfucker, dive!
Travis: (caw)
Matt: All right. You guys start seeing this happen in the distance and a little sparkle of hope hits you, whatever it may be. Coming back around to the top, Umbrasyl is taking a double dash motion. He's past.
Liam: He got away.
Matt: Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: Can I see that flurry of black feathers streaking downwards of this guy?
Matt: You do, and it is a perpetual flurry. They're coming out of nowhere. It is this long, visual line of black feathers that are being tossed from beneath Vax's flapping cape.
Travis: We're going full Point Break terminal velocity, straight down towards Vax.
Sam: I hope I can hold on! There's nothing to grab onto, is there?
Matt: There's just heavy feathers and digging in.
Sam: Luckily, I have a grappling hook. (dink dink dink)
Travis: Maybe in my dive position I could squeeze your legs with my wings, how about that?
Laura: You're really smart. You would think to do that.
Travis: I would.
Ashley: Yeah, you would.
Travis: I would also think, what idiot was just flying behind the back of this dragon on a chain? What a fool.
Matt: So as you go into a full dive, that's 80 speed, that's 160 feet. (whoosh) You manage to just crest underneath the plummeting Vax, the trail of black feathers, trailed by a long line of brown feathers being plucked out from Scanlan, feverishly trying to grab onto your back for some sort of purchase. Pain. You deal with pain all the time. It doesn't dissolve your focus. Vax, I need you to go ahead and attempt to grab onto the eagle as it swoops beneath you. Go ahead and make a single strength saving throw.
Liam: No, wait, Luck! I have one last Luck.
Matt: This is the time to use it.
Laura: Oh my god!
Liam: 21.
Matt: As the eagle swoops underneath you, you reach out. You don't even see it, you're looking up into the sky as you plummet, the trail of feathers going past as you concentrate on the acceptance you've made to the Raven Queen, and the understanding that perhaps, if there is a chance to survive, let it be through this leap of faith you've taken in the direction of an entity that you've been so fearful of and scoffed at since she came to you in your dreams. A moment, you see the feathers begin to trail off and subside from beneath your cloak, and a voice whispers in your ear and says, "Left." Without thinking, your hand reaches out, without even seeing, and you (impact) grab the edge of Scanlan's cloak.
Sam: Oh no!
Matt: As you're dragged behind, you (choking) from behind.
Sam: It's worth it, it's worth it!
Matt: You can barely breathe as the eagle swoops up, you can feel the heartbeat, the blood flowing in the back of your head, your ears hot (heartbeat) as you slowly reach over and grab the back of the eagle. Is this Keyleth? You don't know. All you know is Scanlan swooped in and in this moment of need, seemingly, a prayer was answered. So what are you guys doing?
Laura: And you're itty bitty still!
Liam: I prefer raven-sized.
Matt: Yeah, he's tiny. That's the only reason I'm not having him tear you off the back of the eagle, because of the size.
Travis: Unless I hear otherwise, I'm making a controlled descent towards the ground.
Matt: Okay. You guys see this in the distance as now the eagle captures the falling Vax and then begins to head down towards the base of the mountain where the Bramblewood meets.
Laura: I guess we head down that direction.
Ashley: Yeah. Make the eagle follow.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way downward towards the bottom. Keyleth, you finish your concentration on the stone. (whoosh) Suddenly, you step through, being pushed through a tunnel of blue light and energy, and for a moment, all you see before you is Vax's face, his tiny little raven-sized face.
Marisha: So cute!
Matt: (whoosh) As you guys watch Keyleth apparate right in front of Vax, and go speeding past you, as she's now plummeting from the air, having summoned to your side.
Marisha: I'm technically an earth elemental still.
Matt: You're still earth elemental? So yeah, you see Keyleth as a giant boulder that appears at the side. You have to dodge out of the way (whoosh) as this giant rock being, out of the corner of your eye, appears before you. However, she sinks straight past you. You're flying as low as you can, you're going terminal velocity, and there is this (rumble) rock entity plummeting at the same rate.
Taliesin: A meteor.
Marisha: You know, it was a good idea when he was still in the dragon.
Matt: Yeah, I know. It was.
Liam: (singing) I came in like a wrecking ball!
Matt: At about 200 feet up, you continue to plummet.
Marisha: 200 feet? That's all right.
Matt: All right. You're not doing anything else? You're going to take the fall?
Marisha: Well, what's below me?
Matt: The very edge of the Bramblewood and the base of the mountain. You're not quite sure where you'll land. You see treetops and rocks.
Taliesin: What's the worst that's going to happen?
Marisha: I would hit zero hit points as an earth elemental and go back to Keyleth.
Matt: And then the rest of the damage would carry over.
Marisha: Right, but 200 feet. That's survivable.
Matt: That's 20d6.
Sam: You'll be fine. What's that? 60 points.
Marisha: Yeah. It's roughly 60 points, and I've got 67 left as this earth elemental.
Matt: All right, so you're going to take it?
Marisha: Hang on, wait. Wait, wait. If I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it right. I'm going to ball up like a cannonball and light up my hands, that I keep forgetting because I didn't know I could do them in elemental form, by the way. Thought it was only beast form. I'm going to light myself on fire and go meteor.
Matt: All right. You guys watch as the earth elemental curls up, forms this streak of flame and smoke behind, and now a plummeting Keyleth meteor goes slamming into the base of the mountain just past you as you pull up from impacting at terminal velocity.
Marisha: I was trying to leave an impression. No pun intended.
Matt: You suffer 76 points of bludgeoning damage upon impact.
Sam: Of Jor-El damage. (laughter)
Matt: (boom) This giant crater is left around your form as now there is this somewhat smoke-swirled Keyleth sprawled out in the center of this.
Marisha: I drop, and I stand up, Keyleth, in the middle of a giant crater.
Matt: The rest of you all eventually catch up. The eagle-back carriers, you on broomback, finding your party bruised, hurt, but ultimately survived this moment of the encounter. As you've all had this moment to yourself, Vex, you hear a noise to your left coming from the exterior of the Bramblewood.
Laura: Can I see what it is?
Matt: You glance off to the side, and you can see, emerging, slowly from the forest, a single humanoid standing before you.
Sam: Is he single?
Matt: No. You see, slowly coming forward, a woman. An older woman, an older goliath woman, missing one eye and missing her forearm-- her left arm, right at the elbow. The right arm clutches a very tall quarterstaff that is being used as a walking stick as she wanders up. You can see dirt smeared in her face, darker dreadlocks pulled tight against the back of the head that dangle past the shoulders, tattoos similar to the ones that adorn Grog across the face and shoulders. She slowly walks towards the party. Let's go ahead and bring our guest for the evening out. You can go around the other way. Let's welcome Chris Perkins!
Liam: Welcome, Chris, welcome!
Taliesin: Is he coming to this side?
Matt: Right to the edge, next to you, Keyleth.
Sam: Do you know how to play this game?
Chris perkins: Keyleth meteor, what?
Marisha: Yeah, that's me.
Matt: As she steps up and emerges from the forest, everyone turns and sees the worry on Vex's face.
Laura: (laughs) Vax pours a drink.
Liam: It was very frightening.
Laura: Halt! Who are you?
Chris perkins: My name is Shale.
Laura: What's your business here?
Chris perkins: I was following a scouting party out to the mountain. But these old bones don't take me as far as fast as they used to.
Travis: Do I recognize Shale?
Matt: You do, actually. Not very well. Shale has been around longer than you have as part of the herd, but is mostly considered past her prime as a warrior. Since she lost her arm, was set to the side, and a lot of the herd seems to not value their elders when they become less powerful in battle, but even still, she carries a bit of spit and vinegar to her. But it's been a while since you've seen her, and to see her surviving out here, both curious and honorable.
Travis: Shale.
Sam: Sorry. You're still an eagle.
Matt: (caw)
Travis: (caw)
Sam: Grog, do you want to say something?
Chris perkins: I will brandish my quarterstaff, my rune-covered quarterstaff, and try to hold this big creature at bay.
Matt: Shale's holding her staff out.
Chris perkins: Stand down, bird!
Liam: I love you! Let me love you!
Sam: All right, all right. I'll drop the form. I'll drop the form.
Travis: Thank you, god. Shale.
Chris perkins: Grog? Is that you?
Travis: Yeah, it's me. I know, you can't tell.
Chris perkins: You're kind of a blur. What's on your face?
Travis: It's a beard.
Chris perkins: You've gotten big.
Travis: Yeah. Lots of lifting. Lots of running, getting strong.
Chris perkins: Last time I saw you, you were the runt of the goatball team.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: You were a runt, Grog?
Travis: No, when I was born, she means. When I was born.
Laura: Was he rather small?
Chris perkins: He was puny.
Travis: Puny compared to mountains and stuff.
Ashley: What's goatball?
Chris perkins: It's a game you play. You stand on pillars of rock, and you hurl balls at each other.
Laura: Made of goats?
Chris perkins: Made of goatskins. Skins, my dear.
Marisha: Sounds kind of fun.
Chris perkins: The object of the game is to knock the other opponents off their pillars.
Liam: That's more civilized than what we were imagining.
Travis: It's a lot of fun, actually.
Laura: Shale, what were you doing out here with a scouting party? It seems--
Chris perkins: We were spying on the dragon. Damnable beast.
Laura: Did you succeed?
Chris perkins: No. The scouting team did not fare well.
Marisha: Are any of them still alive?
Chris perkins: No. They're all dead.
Sam: How did you survive?
Chris perkins: I was slow and stupid. I shouldn't have gone at all. I couldn't keep up with them. By the time I got to them, they were corpses.
Sam: You sound like an excellent addition to our team, then.
Chris perkins: She says, I would have killed the dragon as soon as it came upon us, when we first arrived in Westruun, but that damn Kevdak formed an alliance with the beast.
Laura: Wait, you think you can kill a dragon?
Ashley: Wait, what did you just say? Oh.
Sam: We knew that.
Ashley: Yes. Realized it as I was saying it.
Chris perkins: That is how I wanted to die. Fighting the dragon.
Marisha: It's funny, we almost just died fighting the dragon. How ironic.
Travis: We put a good hurting on it, yeah. Do you-- I mean, not like I'm questioning what can you do, because I don't think it's very much.
Marisha: I'm actually great. I'm just in a smoldering meteor and look like a badass.
Matt: Which caught your attention, the large, crashing boom.
Chris perkins: That was it.
Liam: I yank on Vex's hand from down below and say, pick me up! Put me on your shoulder!
Laura: What's the matter? Can you not see anything down there? I pop Trinket out and put Vax on top of him. Don't you feel so tall now?
Liam: I am tall.
Marisha: How much longer is he going to be tiny?
Matt: How long does the potion last?
Liam: I rolled a three, so that's three hours.
Matt: Yeah, three hours.
Travis: Sweet.
Liam: We have to decide what to do. He's gone back to his hole. He's going to rest. He's going to heal.
Marisha: I just have such a hard time taking you seriously right now. I'm so sorry.
Travis: So you had to have been a part of this party for a reason. What's in your bag of tricks? What can you do?
Chris perkins: I smash things with my stick.
Travis: With your stick. Does magic come out of your stick?
Chris perkins: It is a magical staff.
Travis: Oh, well, that's good.
Sam: Yeah, we could use more of those.
Travis: Is it a magical staff of dragon killing?
Chris perkins: It will be if we get on with it.
Travis: I like that.
Liam: I like her, too.
Marisha: So, Shale, did you and your scouting party find out any additional information that might be handy?
Laura: Maybe how to get into the lair without it knowing?
Marisha: What she said.
Chris perkins: I know nothing of use.
Laura: That's wonderful.
Liam: You never made it up to the cave entrance, did you?
Chris perkins: I made it up to the dead ones. That's as far as I got.
Laura: How far were the dead ones?
Chris perkins: A ways.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: I hate to tell you this, but Kevdak is gone.
Chris perkins: No great loss.
Sam: Your whole herd may have perished fighting this same dragon.
Liam: Not all of them.
Marisha: A lot of them.
Travis: But it will all be worth it if we can remove the head of this shitty black dragon.
Chris perkins: I agree.
Laura: Plus, Zanror is still alive, as is his wife. I think.
Sam: Maybe.
Marisha: We hope.
Taliesin: Possibly.
Travis: So, how far would you think that we are from his lair?
Chris perkins: I'll just crane my neck up the mountain.
Matt: It's a sizable climb. Gatshadow-- While this portion is the south part of the Cliffkeep Mountains, which get higher the further north you go, this mountain is called Gatshadow because it is dark and ominous and stands out amongst the rest of the mountains. While the other ones crest at about maybe 4,000 feet up, this one's nearly a mile, a little over a mile high.
Laura: Well, we can obviously fly.
Matt: There are sparse trees, most of them dead or dried out towards the top, but other than that the vegetation is pretty sparse.
Travis: Look, I'm a little jacked up. I think those two are a little jacked up.
Marisha: I could use a short rest.
Travis: It's fair to assume that he will do the same thing, yeah?
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Go brush his teeth, have a deuce, all that stuff.
Marisha: We're trying to catch the dragon while he's still debilitated, right?
Liam: The longer we wait, the harder it will be.
Ashley: What if I just heal everybody and we keep on?
Sam: Yeah, that's great.
Ashley: I don't want to lose the damage that's on him.
Sam: Yeah, heal us and let's keep going. Quickly. How long has it been, a minute? Two minutes?
Matt: Since you guys landed here? It's probably been about two, three minutes.
Sam: We've got to move.
Travis: Can we travel a mile up a mountain quickly?
Sam: We have eagles.
Matt: Even at your fastest pace, eagle speed...
Liam: The broom and the two eagles at this point?
Matt: The broom is slower than the eagles. Eagle speed you're looking at about-- I'm estimating somewhere between ten to 20 minutes.
Liam: That's enough for a short rest for it. He's not going to go back to full strength, but he's going to go back up a bit.
Laura: Would we know that?
Marisha: We don't know what he has access to.
Matt: You would know, being as dragons are your favored enemy, and you have information on that. Generally, they don't-- They themselves can recover over time, and if given a full day or so, they can largely recover from the wounds they have sustained almost entirely, especially a dragon as powerful as an ancient. You would know that, because they understand and fear their demise, or at least are arrogant enough to think it's not possible, they will have certain reserves to try and help them recover if they ever find themselves in a dire circumstance. Occasionally, depending on the intelligence of the dragon and what resources it has at its disposal.
Marisha: Reserves. What do you mean?
Laura: Healing stuff?
Matt: Some semblance of healing magic, items they may have acquired that can help. The longer you wait, the more it can recover, is essentially what it comes down to.
Liam: We need to go now. We need to go.
Sam: Should we mist form it there? Can we do that?
Laura: That takes too long to think about.
Marisha: I can get us there via trees.
Sam: But you'd need to know a tree that's there.
Marisha: I need to know a tree that's there. I could Scry, look for the closest tree, teleport us there, but by the time I'm getting there, I'm exhausted.
Liam: Are you able to see a tree from a great distance?
Marisha: If I Scry.
Liam: Not even by eyesight?
Marisha: I mean, I guess I can look around and take a guess.
Ashley: I'm going to cast Mass Cure Wounds on everybody.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and do that. And Shale, you feel nice and warm at full health as the Mass Cure Wounds tickles you.
Laura: Is your arm back?
Matt: Unfortunately, no. If only!
Sam: The temporary hit points never go back up, right?
Matt: Correct, no. They were just for that little bit of damage.
Chris perkins: Lost it in an avalanche, I did.
Sam: Today?
Chris perkins: No, turd.
Matt: The Scrying will take you about ten minutes or so.
Laura: Are we going to Scry it or are we just going to go? How long would it take if we just flew up? 20 minutes?
Matt: That's if you were all on eagle-back. Which you don't. You have eight people, and you currently have two summoned eagles.
Liam: Speed of the slowest.
Matt: Yeah, the speed of the slowest here, you're looking at walking up the mountain.
Marisha: Yeah. So I can teleport us closer and then walk, or we can take a very short rest so I can get my beast shaping back, and then could fly a few more of us. It's a gamble.
Chris perkins: You take your rest, love. I'll start up the mountain.
Matt: Shale walks away and starts hiking up the rocks at the very base of Gatshadow.
Travis: Can I just say that we agree that the reason we didn't do what Zanror wanted and go to the lair is because it's a fucking death trap?
Sam: Yes, but the dragon is injured now.
Travis: But he's going to heal up by the time we get there.
Sam: Not all the way.
Travis: Pretty good.
Liam: It's still the best chance we have. We have to kill it now.
Travis: In its lair?
Chris perkins: It's your destiny to fight the dragon, Grog.
Marisha: Wait, what? What was that, Shale? Is that true?
Chris perkins: No, it's not true. (laughter)
Ashley: Everybody is healed 27.
Chris perkins: It's just a thing old women say.
Marisha: Just let him believe it.
Liam: Kiki, may I have my-- Sorry. (higher voice) May I have my cloak back?
Marisha: Oh, yeah, sure.
Liam: Thank you. (flump, whoosh)
Matt: To attune to it will take you a short rest.
Marisha: So are we resting?
Matt: That's up to you guys.
Liam: I don't know. But I'm still putting it on.
Travis: When I turned into the eagle, what happened to the Bloodaxe and chain?
Matt: Actually, you check, and the equipment that you have attuned to you and attached go into the form with you, so at this moment you realize, "Oh, the axe!" You look behind you, and it's just been dragging behind you in the dirt, carving this path in the rocks and rubble.
Travis: Yeah. That's nifty.
Matt: Like a kid with a deflated balloon you're just dragging behind you.
Laura: Can I-- well, I can't sense anything about it with Hunter's Mark, I just know where he is.
Matt: You know where it is.
Laura: And he's up in his lair.
Matt: He is up at the top of Gatshadow, somewhere in that mountain.
Laura: Moving around, or is he chilling?
Matt: At the moment, seems chilling.
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: Short rest or not, what are you guys doing?
Marisha: How long would the hike up the mountain be? An hour?
Matt: It's about a mile up. You're looking at the better part of a day.
Sam: Oh, a mile up.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Unless we fly.
Taliesin: What if we take shifts with the eagles?
Matt: Take shifts with the eagles? Back and forth?
Taliesin: Eagles fly a group up, fly down, pick up another group and bring them?
Matt: Probably about an hour.
Taliesin: But that's an hour with a short rest for everybody as well.
Matt: If you're going to do it that way, yeah.
Liam: Half could rest at the top while the eagles fly back, and the ones at the bottom could rest.
Taliesin: So there's a short rest.
Liam: Shifts of resting, yeah.
Matt: You're still looking at about an hour and a half at that point, with people moving there and back and getting enough rest. You can't short rest on the trip, and the short rest is about an hour, half an hour.
Liam: Eagles drop off, they rest while the eagles return, and the people at the bottom rest while the eagles are making the trip, no?
Matt: Right, but you still have to have the eagles that went to the bottom to pick up the second team to get there, so you're still looking at about an hour and a half to two hours.
Laura: I could also use another spell and summon a couple more eagles.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: I could summon two more eagles.
Liam: That's worth it.
Laura: And that could get how many of us up?
Liam: All of us up at the same time.
Sam: But one is just for Grog, right?
Laura: But two more eagles would get all of us up?
Matt: It's a concentration spell. You can only have one of it up at a time.
Laura: It is?
Matt: Yeah. And it only lasts for an hour, and you've already been at this for probably about ten, 15 minutes.
Laura: So they're about to go away.
Matt: You have about another 40 minutes of the eagles.
Marisha: So we couldn't do round trips anyway. They'd dissipate.
Matt: You'd just have to recast it.
Marisha: Well, yeah.
Sam: That seems like our fastest option. What's the other option? A short rest and then we bamf.
Marisha: We rest and then go. If we rest for 30 minutes, and then I switch and then we have the eagles, then we can get up in another 30 minutes, and then it's an hour. Theoretically, short resting is our shortest.
Matt: You said you have Transport Via Plants, right?
Marisha: I do.
Matt: If you wanted to Scry up that mountain and look at one of the trees at the top, you could do that. That would be, technically, the fastest way.
Marisha: But then we'd still have to hike. How long would the hike be?
Matt: It depends on how close the nearest tree to the cavern would be.
Sam: Let's do that.
Marisha: I'm tapping myself-- I can do it, but I'm tapping myself out. I'm burning literally all my top level spells and I have no beast shapes left. But I can do it. It's what we think is most important.
Laura: What if we use the eagles, send them up. Once they're used up, they're gone at the top, and then I'll just summon two more and send everybody else up? Once the people make it up the top, that way it takes less time. A couple people hop on the eagles right now, because we only have a little bit of time left.
Marisha: Can I rest? Can I rest while the first round goes?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: We're fighting a dragon in its lair! In the worst place we could possibly fight it!
Sam: We've also dealt so much damage to it.
Matt: Umbrasyl was looking pretty rough.
Sam: I fisted through it!
Taliesin: He said looking pretty rough.
Travis: That's because he's a liar and a bringer of death, and he is smiling at you while he does it.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: What are we going to do today with Chris Perkins? Talk, or go fucking kill a dragon?
Taliesin: Would you like a tour of Whitestone? It's really lovely this time of year.
Chris perkins: I'm judging you!
Liam: Grog, she's right. It is your destiny.
Travis: In your tiny voice.
Liam: What are you laughing at?
Laura: Everybody hop on an eagle.
Ashley: I hop on an eagle.
Taliesin: Hopping on an eagle.
Sam: Well, no, half of the people hop on an eagle.
Laura: Two of the halflings-- two of the gnomes can get on.
Ashley: Scanlan.
Sam: I'm in back?
Ashley: Yes.
Liam: I'm sort of a halfling. Can I get on too?
Matt: At your size? The three of you would probably be able to take one eagle, because you are tiny.
Sam: Oh, that's right, he's a little one.
Laura: All right. You guys go.
Liam: See you in a bit, sis! Bye, Keek!
Matt: So we'll say, for the purposes of this, it'll take an additional cast of your spell, so mark off a second casting of Conjure Woodland Beings. However, that brings-- What level is that?
Laura: That is level-- Oh, good. Level three.
Matt: Conjure Woodland Beings?
Laura: So I've got two level threes left. With my Pearl of power.
Matt: Conjure Woodland Beings is a 4th-level spell, Laura.
Laura: I have Conjure Animals, not Woodland Beings.
Matt: Animals, there we go. Sorry, so yeah, that is 3rd-level. So yeah, mark off your second casting there. You guys manage to make a short rest between the journeys, making your way up towards the dark, blackened rock peak of Gatshadow. We're going to take a short break here for restroom. We'll be back here in a few minutes. In the meantime we have an awesome video from Backblaze to show you guys--
Ashley: Yay!
Taliesin: It's really cute.
Marisha: It's for you guys!
Matt: We'll be back here in a few minutes guys, stay tuned for apparently the attack on Umbrasyl's lair. See you in a minute. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. We've had a little break here. A quick announcement for you guys, the rebroadcast tonight will be delayed for about 30 minutes as we have to shoot something directly after this so we can all go home. So, if you guys are in chat after and folks are showing up going, "Where's the rebroadcast?" Just let them know it'll be around, about a 20-30 minute break between. We appreciate you guys carrying that thread over to them when they arrive. So we've had a break. If you wanted to use any of your hit dice to heal up during the short rest, now's the time to do it. You've re-attuned to the Dragon Slayer Longsword. And just so you guys know, both Grog and Vax leveled up to 14 as well. Vax took a level of paladin during the short rest. Grog also took his 14th level as a barbarian. As a berserker, a lot of you know what that means.
Sam: I don't know what that means.
Liam: We'll find out. I'd like to re-attune to the Cloak of Displacement. And the Boots of Haste, are they spent for the day for anybody? If I were to wear them, could I get the juice or no? They're done?
Laura: They're too big for you, teeny.
Liam: They would shrink to me. I'm going to re-attune my Keen Dagger, then, for the moment. So it's Deathwalkers Ward, Keen Dagger, Cloak. Three items.
Matt: Okay. I'll let it happen. Usually, you attune one item in a short rest.
Liam: Oh, okay. No, I can do one.
Matt: I think it's fine for this. You get attuned as you walk up the rest of the way. It's fine.
Travis: I've rolled all nine of my hit dice.
Matt: So you're out of hit dice?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right. Everyone else good? Ready to jump back in?
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: (laughs)
Sam: Does anyone need more healing? Are we okay?
Marisha: Yeah, we're good.
Laura: And because I Conjured Woodland Animals, I lost my Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Yes, you did, but you know loosely where it was.
Sam: All right, let's hurry.
Matt: As you guys slowly make your way up towards the peak of Gatshadow, you all come to rest maybe, from what best you can tell, is the entrance cavern that Umbrasyl currently calls its home. Across this blackened, dark craggy surface, you see clumps of dead, petrified trees. Leafless, gnarled, and devoid of any life. There are signs of melted stone, soot. Long ago, there may have been a fire that claimed the top of this mountain and set its visual presentation that got its name. However, this is your moment, should you wish to make your way towards your conflict with Umbrasyl. How do you wish to prepare?
Laura: I want to sleep for a day.
Marisha: Yeah. I want to rock back and forth in a corner.
Liam: I'd like to go stealth and I'd like to see-- is there one clear, main entrance to this place?
Matt: There is a cavern opening.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: There are a few small little inlets into the mountain at certain points, but the path that you guys land on that ends? You're going to have to climb around the mountain to get to the entrance of this. There is no walk-up path. Actually, just an opening on the side of the mountain.
Liam: So we're further down still. We're not near the entrance?
Matt: You're about 400 to 500 feet away from the entrance.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: You stealth ahead and look a little bit and you notice the path comes to an end. You probably have about a hundred feet that you have to scale the side of mountain to get to the entrance.
Liam: From where I am, I can tell that we need to climb around it. If I look very hard, do I see any little holes or cracks or anything above?
Matt: You see one other small entrance about maybe 60 feet below it, a little bit to the left.
Liam: All right.
Sam: Pretty cool sound effects
Chris perkins: It's freaking me out.
Laura: Is that your music?
Matt: That is not my music. That's the atmosphere.
Taliesin: Shale, Shale. The scouting party. Where did you find the bodies? Where were they left?
Matt: Which actually you-- this was probably a couple hundred feet back. They made it near the peak. However, they were spotted upon the approach, and you heard the battle. The very short battle that ensued. Heard the screams of them, far from your eyesight.
Chris perkins: I will have pointed them out, then.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: So that's why I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Liam: How far above our position is that smaller entrance-- (noise of hissing gas)
Matt: It's all atmosphere, guys. I paid them to do it. I know. All right. Towards where the actual walkable portion of this mountain cliff ends, you have about 40 feet of scaleable wall, at an upward angle, before you can reach that small little inlet that you saw there. An additional 60 feet beyond that is the larger entrance where you saw, the best you can tell, Umbrasyl retreat towards-- or exit before, when you were watching him emerge from the mountain. That's it.
Liam: What do you think? Do you think I should climb in that little hole?
Laura: Do you want-- say that again?
Liam: There's a main entrance above. But there's also a smaller, little gap lower down. He cannot fit in there.
Marisha: I can try and scry inside the cavern.
Laura: See if it's something that would be worth--
Marisha: Get a battle perspective?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: All right. You have to give me a few minutes. Is everyone all right with that?
Laura: Can I use my ranger skills to try to camouflage us into the side of the mountain? To make us even more non-seeable?
Matt: Yeah. Totally. So we'll say for the purposes of that, anyone at this point who'd like to make a stealth check, to go ahead and keep yourselves hidden from any onlooking parties.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Laura: Add ten.
Liam: Natural 20!
Marisha: Hey!
Matt: Add ten for Pass Without a Trace.
Sam: 17.
Taliesin: 24.
Chris perkins: 22.
Travis: 16.
Ashley: 29.
All: Whoa!
Ashley: What?! (laughter)
Liam: Why, I do declare.
Ashley: Well, I do declare I'm invisible.
Matt: The armored cleric cannot be seen. (laughter)
Laura: 32.
Matt: With Vex's help, you guys manage to take bits of the mud, soot, and the burnt remnants of the once lush forest that dotted this mountainside, and darken your exteriors to help obscure the vision of anything that wished to pry, along with the magic drawing the shadows to your forms. You're pretty confident that most of you would be fairly difficult to be spotted by most creatures.
Liam: I would just like to point out that my complete total is 45.
Ashley: Of stealthing?
Laura: Thank you. Thank you for pointing that out.
Liam: Yes. It's mostly for your benefit.
Laura: I appreciate it.
Matt: That's ridiculous.
Ashley: How?
Laura: How?
Liam: Natural 20, plus my 15 benefit, plus Pass Without a Trace. Poof! (vanishing sound)
Matt: You've stealthed through time. People who had seen you previously in your past, have no recollection of ever actually seeing you. (laughter)
Liam: Marty McFly's holding a photograph.
Matt: Exactly. All right. So, what's up now?
Marisha: I take a little of the soot, and I give myself some druid battle make-up.
Matt: There you go, just smear it.
Laura: Yeah. Did you scry yet?
Marisha: I'm about to.
Laura: Okay. I do the same thing. I soot my face up, too. Let's all make battle paint while she's scrying.
Taliesin: Absolutely not. (laughter)
Marisha: Pretentious asshole.
Ashley: I want to do a hand. (laughter)
Laura: I get soot on my finger and walk up to Percy and just put a line from his forehead down his face.
Taliesin: I feel violated, but thank you.
Chris perkins: I'll ask Grog if he wants any soot on his face. I'll walk over.
Travis: I'll put soot on your face if you come near me with that wicked, wicked staff of yours.
Chris perkins: This is not wicked. It's just a staff. It doesn't even have a name.
Travis: What?! How could you have a staff and not give it a name?
Chris perkins: Only men name their things. (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah. My staff doesn't have a name. It's so true.
Chris perkins: You know, if you kill this dragon, you'll be the greatest goliath that's ever lived.
Travis: No.
Chris perkins: Yes!
Travis: Really?
Chris perkins: No one else has killed a dragon of this size. Not among us. Not among the Herd.
Ashley: Grog.
Travis: Pike killed a dragon.
Chris perkins: Did you, now?
Ashley: Well, we all did. But it wasn't this big.
Laura: It was pretty small.
Ashley: It was pretty-- it was a lot bigger than me.
Chris perkins: I'm sure that experience will come in handy.
Sam: All right, let's do this.
Marisha: All right. I scry. I focus really hard on the dragon.
Matt: Okay. On Umbrasyl?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Do you need any of his stomach bile to help you scry?
Marisha: Sure! Can I have some of the-- I scrape a little stomach bile--
Sam: Does that help? Does that help?
Matt: Well, here. Let me pull up the actual specifics for Scrying here.
Chris perkins: This is going to go well, I can feel it.
Marisha: Wait. He's going to sense what I can scry, can't he? Maybe I can just try and scry inside the lair?
Matt: It largely depends.
Sam: What do you want to do?
Marisha: I mean, he knows we're coming, yeah?
Laura: Can you scry that little cavern to see where it leads to? Can you scry your mind up the cavern?
Marisha: Yeah. Actually, can I do that? Like it's a camera drone?
Matt: It's more like picking a location, as opposed to an actual--
Marisha: Sure. I want to try and focus on Umbrasyl's whereabouts, but I want to see if I can get a nice bird's-eye view of inside the cavern.
Matt: Okay. You are familiar with the target as you've done battles, that does adjust the saving throw for the scry. So, without further ado, what's the DC of your spells currently?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19. Hmm. As your eyes close, your vision projects itself beyond your form, beyond the craggy landscape of Gatshadow, out beyond the mountain pass that ends abruptly. Beyond the cavern entrance, you are pulled within the darkness. Suddenly, you find a little bit of light scatters across the damp stonework of the inside of this cavern. You see stalagmites. You see pools of murky, greenish-brackish liquid, ever so gently disturbed by the wind that curls in and out of this cavern. You see towards the back an elevated platform next to another pool, where a large outcropping of stone that has just slowly pulled itself out of the rock, nearly touching the very height of this cavern. You don't see anything in there. All you hear is (low breathing sound).
Sam: He's asleep.
Chris perkins: (loudly) What do you see?
Marisha: Ah! (laughter)
Marisha: Well, nothing now. That's it? That's all I see?
Matt: That's all you see.
Laura: Did you see Umbrasyl?
Marisha: No, but I heard him. He sounds very rough, or possibly sleeping? I don't know, there was a lot of heavy breathing. Very deep-- not, you know, shallow breathing. Not impassioned breathing, Scanlan.
Laura: Could he still be invisible?
Marisha: He could I guess still be invisible. Also the cave was covered in acid pools and dark and dingy and everything else we would expect.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I know.
Travis: Let's do it.
Sam: Okay. We're going in the small hole or the big hole?
Marisha: I don't think he caught my presence. I don't think he's necessarily expecting us. We can have the element of surprise, here.
Liam: Let me check out that hole on top. You guys can watch me do it.
Laura: Go in the little hole, then.
Liam: I'm little now. It's a big hole. It's quite big, actually.
Laura: It's roomy.
Liam: I'd like to climb up to it.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead--
Liam: Spider-sense tingling the whole time.
Matt: All right. So you manage to find bits of rock and pull yourself across the way. It's not too long a distance but enough to the point where I need you to go ahead and make a basic strength check.
Liam: 14.
Matt: 14. Okay. It's hard and you feel part of your muscles build up lactic acid from the exertion, from the previous round with Umbrasyl and you not being necessarily the strongest individual of the troupe, but you do manage to scurry your way up to the edge of this small opening in the mountainside. Getting inside, you get a look: this hole continues for about 15 feet into the mountain before it ends abruptly. The only other thing you notice is there are currently four long-dead skeleton corpses within this hole. Perhaps some sort of mountain-climbing expedition or travelers that found their way there, and couldn't escape. There are remnants of a small camp. Perhaps a small fire that is long iced-over through winters past. A layer of dust sits on everything and other than the occasional gust of wind that finds its way in here, largely undisturbed for a long period of time.
Liam: I want to look through the remains.
Matt: Okay. You rummage through the remains. You find roughly 85 gold pieces amongst their corpses and spare change in silver and copper--
Liam: I don't take that.
Matt: Copper. The pennies of D&D. Poor things. Copper dragons everywhere are just so disappointed. You do find an oil lantern, climbing gear for four people, some long-spoiled rations. And you find a very moldy diary.
Liam: I take out the Flametongue Dagger and give myself some light.
Matt: As you're scanning through most of the pages that are still intact and not completely molded over or destroyed, it appears to be a journal that contains writings of what was an expedition to reach the peak of Gatshadow, because there was some sort of movement, some sort of activity up there that nobody could really discern. The rumors speak of some sort of creature that would stalk out in the night and steal mountain goats. (belches) Pardon me. Goats! Steal mountain goats, steal or find and kill anybody who lived in-- there used to be a smaller village that lived north on the mountainscape that is now abandoned because of this creature the folklore of the time said supposedly lived at the top of the mountain. It speaks of the entrance, the place that Umbrasyl now calls the lair, and this leads you to believe that this is a fresh lair. Umbrasyl did not appear to always live within Gatshadow, but is only currently making it its lair at the moment.
Liam: Is this a dead end? Does it look like it goes further in?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: By the light of my dagger.
Matt: Actually, this would be investigation.
Liam: Investigation? All right. 20. No, wait-- Yeah, 20.
Matt: 20. Feeling along the walls, you find elements of the rocks that are easier to break off than others, but this is predominantly the end of this cavern.
Liam: It's a cave. Okay. I tell my sister  it's a dead end. It's nothing. Coming.
Matt: So Vax finds his way back to the group.
Sam: It's a dead end? Jesus. This ain't going to be good. Shale, would you like to lead the way?
Chris perkins: Yes. Now, I may not survive this. I'm quite old, and I can only see about 30 feet ahead of me--
Laura: Well then, maybe she doesn't lead the way. (laughter)
Liam: My sister and I should lead the way. You stick to Grog, will you, grandma?
Chris perkins: I whack him. (laughter)
Matt: (whack sound)
Liam: Wait! I don't get to dodge?
Matt: No. Because, unexpected, she is swift, and she is strong for being one-armed and of her age. The sting hits the side of your shoulder before you have a moment to really understand and your diminutive form is thrown about three or four feet back before you catch yourself.
Travis: (laughter)
Liam: I skitter off ahead of the group.
Marisha: I cast Protection from Acid on Grog, again.
Chris perkins: Now, if I don't survive, loves, I do have some magic on me. So this staff has runes. You can scratch them off and magical things will appear! And this horn, if you blow it real loud, it will let out a tremendous thunder that could bring down the entire cave.
Sam: I don't think you should be planning for your own death!
Laura: I'll take the horn.
Chris perkins: It might explode.
Sam: It might explode?!
Chris perkins: It's a little unstable.
Laura: Scanlan, you should take the horn.
Sam: She's not dead yet!
Laura: I'm saying when she dies. If she dies.
Sam: We're not going to divvy up her stuff! That's bad luck!
Liam: She's bequeathing it to you in her will.
Chris perkins: And this pendant here, which looks like a dragon tooth, it's a dragon tooth. And if you wear it, it will close your wounds.
Laura: Could I insight check her? I feel like she's lying through her teeth. (laughter)
Matt: Make an insight check.
Sam: Maybe we should just kill her now and take the stuff.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: Really? So, Chris?
Chris perkins: I'm being super sincere.
Laura: Oh. I really want all those things--
Chris perkins: She honestly believes. (laughter)
Marisha: Shale, you seem almost like you're--
Chris perkins: My hide armor ain't worth shit.
Marisha: As I was saying, you seem like you're almost expecting to die, or you're looking forward to it?
Chris perkins: Well, I'm very old. And if I could die fighting a dragon, well, there's no better way to go. If I don't die, great! Wonderful!
Marisha: All right. Just checking that we wouldn't disappoint you if you don't die.
Travis: Wait, just to be clear  if we kill the dragon, are you going to say you killed the dragon or would you say I killed the dragon? Who's going to be the greatest goliath?
Chris perkins: Why, you, of course.
Travis: Yeah?
Chris perkins: I'm past my prime.
Travis: We'll shake on it?
Chris perkins: I will shake on it.
Matt: Which is easy because you put out the proper hand for the one arm she has.
Chris perkins: You want to mess with her, put out your other hand. (laughter)
Marisha: Shale, what type of magic do you wield, exactly?
Chris perkins: I wield this staff.
Marisha: Okay. Very clear.
Taliesin: This is going to be great! I'm on board and committed to this. This is very exciting!
Sam: Thank you, Shale. Let's try to live.
Marisha: So remember, acid pools everywhere. Do we have any type of cohesive plan, or just--
Sam: We're just going to go in.
Taliesin: Just be very quiet.
Liam: I'm already looking for traps, looking for danger.
Matt: So you're coming up to the entrance.
Liam: I'm not going to go in the entrance, but I'm going to try to climb up and peer over the edge and look as carefully as I can.
Matt: Go ahead and make another strength check.
Liam: 17.
Matt: You manage to climb your way up to the larger mouth of the cavern. It's about 40 feet across at the very front of it. And about 50 feet up. It's this large--
Liam: 40 feet, 50 feet?
Matt: Yeah. And the rest of you guys? Are you pursuing?
Sam: I'm going to come.
Matt: Rest of you climbing along the mountain as well?
Sam: Wait, is that the way in?
Travis: Is there anything you can do to make the dragon visible with his invisibility? Set fire, or your faeries?
Marisha: I do have Faerie Fire. You combine the two things that you said and it's fantastic.
Travis: Totally meant to. Okay. I'm just climbing. I'll follow them.
Matt: All right. Everyone who's climbing, I need you to roll a strength check.
Marisha: Wait! Who's climbing where?
Matt: There's no actual walkway to it.
Laura: Does anybody want to ride the broom with me?
Taliesin: I'll ride the broom. I'm not a climber.
Sam: My Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, are those attuned items?
Matt: I don't think they are, no.
Sam: I'll put on my Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, which I got two years ago.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: 19.
Sam: I don't know what they do.
Matt: Advantage on the roll.
Sam: Oh, great! 16.
Matt: 16? Okay.
Chris perkins: 18.
Matt: 18. All right.
Ashley: 12.
Matt: Okay. And you're floating up?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All of you begin to shimmy across the surface. The wind is piercingly cold. The clouds up here are dark and there isn't enough moisture to rain, but there are flashes of some sort of wild lightning storm that go off in the distance in the roiling clouds. As you're making your way across, Pike, your foot skips across one of the stones, it breaks and falls beneath you and you almost lose yourself. Grog grabs you, and holds you in place, and pulls you back up.
Ashley: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: Nobody saw anything.
Ashley: I thought I would be stronger, but I'm still not.
Travis: You're a champ.
Laura: Wait! Aren't you wearing the strength gauntlets?
Ashley: Yes, I am. That brought me to 12. (laughter)
Matt: You all slowly make your way to the very mouth of the cavern. You've been at this point, as well. You wanted to go ahead and make an investigation?
Liam: Scootching in, yeah.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. Feeling around the exterior, there are two rocks that are nearly identical, placed at each side of the cavern entrance. Upon approaching, their texture and their weathered appearance is far younger than the rest of the stone around them, and that catches your attention.
Liam: Do I need a further investigation check to discern their nature?
Matt: The nature is some semblance of a magical enchantment. This is a little beyond your understanding unless you want to try and roughshod it in the way you know how.
Travis: Call me up to the front. We got this.
Liam: Scanlan, do you want to grab that big...
Sam: Big what?
Liam: Shale.
Sam: Oh, Shale.
Liam: And yourself.
Sam: You got a trap up there, friend?
Liam: Something. There's rocks up here that look a little funky and I don't think they actually are rocks.
Sam: Rocks? Hey Keyleth, you should go. There are rocks. You could do something with rocks--
Marisha: I love rocks!
Sam: Yeah, I know. Go up there with Shale. Shale's a rock. Go.
Marisha: Okay. What's happening? Where am I?
Liam: Just come up a little bit slowly. There are a couple of rocks up here that look a little funny to me. Don't step on me.
Marisha: Oh right! You're so tiny right now. I keep forgetting that.
Chris perkins: You're very brave for someone so small!
Marisha: Do you want me to put you in a little pouch? Could be like a kangaroo?
Sam: We're going to die!
Liam: Another time.
Matt: As Keyleth and Shale approach the threshold that you're currently standing at, the rest of you are a little ways behind. He points out these two stones. Go ahead and both of you guys make an arcana check. Shale, just from what you've seen in the world.
Chris perkins: Right. 13.
Marisha: I think like, seven. Pretty sure my arcana-- It's seven.
Matt: Oh, druids. You ascertain, Shale, just from stumbling upon such constructions, this is-- There's some sort of magical essence to these rocks. It's old magic, which is the only reason you really recognize it. It's not the hoity-toity-learned-in-a-tower magic all the stupid people in the world tend to learn. This is old magic. That's all you were able to pick from it.
Liam: You know what it is?
Chris perkins: Old magic. (laughter)
Liam: Hey, dirty bard, could you come up here?
Sam: Oi! I'm here now. Sorry. I thought that the rock people could handle it.
Liam: All hands on deck.
Marisha: Scanlan, it's a very pretty rock--
Sam: 11 on arcana.
Matt: It's old magic.
Sam: This is old magic. (laughter)
Sam: Not the kind you learn in those hoity-toity towers.
Ashley: What's going on down there? (laughter)
Sam: Can't you just melt the rocks, Keyleth?
Marisha: Pike, these are very attractive rocks. What does it look like?
Sam: It looks like a rock. Melt it!
Marisha: No. What does it look like? Is it like a slate?
Matt: There are two stones about three to four foot in diameter that are almost matching, that are younger, less weathered than the rest of the stonework around them.
Chris perkins: Is there any way to circumvent them? Or are they in opposite sides?
Matt: They're on opposite sides. You could circumvent them, they're not in your path.
Marisha: I can alter their shape. I can melt, I can do something with them.
Liam: No. Just, they're not real. A few steps back. Trickfoot's--
Marisha: What do you mean, they're not real?
Ashley: I walk up.
Laura: Can you dispel that shit?
Ashley: Yes. Is it magic--?
Sam: It's old magic. (laughter)
Chris perkins: It's old magic. (laughter)
Taliesin: Not the kind of magic you learn in ivory towers.
Chris perkins: Older-than-me magic.
Ashley: That's just old. (laughter)
Sam: It sort of has that old smell to it.
Liam: Hey, fuck it. I'm going to take a good, hard look at this rock.
Marisha: Hang on. We might be able to circumvent it. Right? Can we go around it?
Ashley: I have Dispel Magic, but I wonder if we should use it.
Sam: Dispel that magic!
Ashley: But that's one of my last spells!
Laura: Well then, let's avoid them. Let's just go around them.
Marisha: Is there room on either side of them?
Matt: They are embedded in the sides of the wall. So you could pass through them, over them, however else you want to try and circumvent them.
Marisha: How about this? I'm going to cast Stoneshape, and can I carve out a little path around one of them, on the edge? Carve a little recess?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Sam: See? Rocks! I told you!
Marisha: Rocks!
Taliesin: Old rocks. Not the kind of rocks one finds in ivory towers.
Matt: Yes. Your 4th-level Stoneshape. You cause a portion of the rock wall at the side of the cavern to actually forge itself into a tunnel, circumventing the exterior rock on the left.
Laura: Could you just do that the entire way into the cavern?
Marisha: I can do it two more times. All the way into the cavern.
Sam: Okay. Let's go through the new hole.
Liam: I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to keep doing the same. Come on, you big giant dummy.
Laura: I'm on a broom, do you want to ride it with me? Just kidding-- Percy's already on.
Liam: I'll stealth ahead and look around.
Matt: Okay. So roll your stealth check.
Liam: A new stealth check?
Matt: Yeah, because you've come out of stealth and back into it.
Liam: Okay. Well, I still have Pass Without a Trace, right? So I'm at 40.
Matt: So you make your way into the next portion. You're actually able to start seeing--
Taliesin: Whoa! Slowly!
Liam: You people don't see shit.
Laura: Oh, that's acid!
Matt: --in a raised platform, in a pool of somewhat pungent-smelling liquid as you get even remotely close to it, the fume causes your sinuses to open and burn and tingle.
Liam: They barely get in.
Laura: Yeah. (cutesy voice) It's too small...
Liam: I'm just going to hold still for a second and listen. Do I hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27? You hear a very faint breathing. Breathing that is trying to stay quiet, but by the sheer immensity of the beast creating the sound, you can pick up the very subtle movement of air through the normally still cavern. (faint breathing noise)
Liam: I'm going to quietly take-- I'm going to back up 15 feet. (whispers) For everyone who's next to me, and for those who are not, it is in here. It is awake. And it is waiting for us.
Chris perkins: What did he say?
Liam: Pike. Don't. Move.
Ashley: I'm so still.
Liam: Just coming running to go when shit goes down, but don't move.
Travis: (whispers) What about putting her on my back?
Liam: Grog, don't move yet. I'm going to go back in for another look.
Sam: Alone?
Matt: Stealth.
Liam: Well, yeah. I'm not a barbarian. I'm going to go along the edge closest to you and move back to where I stopped to listen.
Matt: About there would be in tandem with where you were.
Liam: And I'm going to go another ten feet in, looking.
Matt: As he curls back, the cavern is revealed further. The pool does come to an end. There are pieces of stone that jut out of the floor. You do see now, scattered across the grounds, occasionally a bit of shine, a little coin-- gold, silver-- elements of wealth that've been dragged deeper into the cavern that have left behind them some remnants in the process of being carried and carted in.
Liam: If I look back, can I see my sister from where I am?
Matt: Actually, no. Because she's really well stealthed.
Liam: She can't see me either?
Matt: No. You guys have no visual perspective on each other. You've all stealthed away from your own party.
Liam: Okay. There's a pool of acid right by me, yeah?
Matt: Yes, there is.
Liam: Is there dim light here?
Matt: The light grows dim at about this point, then it becomes darkness at about this point.
Liam: But you said that I can see a pool of liquid, right?
Matt: Yeah. What little bit of daylight that's coming in the cavern entrance would be over here.
Liam: Is the surface of the liquid flat as far as I can see?
Matt: What you can see, it is flat. There's a little, very faint breeze that occasionally comes through so there's a slight disturbance here and there, but no specific visual disturbance.
Liam: How far along that pool can I actually see? If you had to do a cut-off point?
Matt: Because of your darkvision, being an elf, you can see pretty much to the edge of this.
Liam: Okay. So it doesn't look like there's a big divot?
Matt: There's no displacement of the pool.
Liam: I'm going to creep along the wall towards that pillar. I'll stop in that corner, and then move towards you one. Does it give me a better view?
Matt: A little bit of a further view, just the cavern continues in that direction.
Liam: Can I still hear the same thing?
Matt: You can hear it very faintly. You can't quite make out the source. There is something about the room and the air that's travelling through here. The sound itself, you're just barely catching it and it seems to be reverberating to a small extent off the walls of this cavern, which carry sound very well.
Liam: What do I see if I look up?
Matt: You look up, you see about 60 feet, 70 feet in the air, just past where your vision begins to fade-- The only reason you know there's a ceiling there is because there are a few points of rock, the top of the cavern does descend into stalactites-- it is?
Chris perkins: Stalactites, yes.
Matt: Yes. Thank you.
Liam: There's no large outcrops that this thing could be sitting on?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The mineral build-up of the inside of this cavern leads to a direct, slick surface in the walls. The minerals rounded off most of the stone.
Liam: I'm going to backtrack. I'm going to find my sister. And I'm still very little. It's at the back of that cavern. It's not in the pool of acid that's near the front, and it's not just past that. It keeps going back. So if we're going to do this, and we're all just going to throw ourselves into it, and let the chips fall where they may. The best thing that I can do right now is take it unawares, hurt it for as much as I can--
Laura: Are you kidding me right now?
Liam: I'm not kidding you! I want to kill this thing. This is the first stepping stone, and I could potentially take it out. Catch it unawares before it vomits on all of you. I want to do it, and I just want to know that you're going to come in after and finish it if you need to. I told you what I want to do.
Laura: All right. I will give you a minute head start to get across the room. After that, I'm coming in. So you better hope you're at the dragon by that point.
Liam: I start off. Come back and tug. (whispers) Jenga.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: I'm going back to where I was.
Matt: All right. What is it?
Liam: With Pass Without a Trace? 43.
Matt: All right. So you're back where you were. The rest of you, what are you doing?
Chris perkins: Well, he's a mad little one, isn't he?
Sam: He's not usually little. (laughter)
Liam: I'd like to go around the column, and around the edge of the wall.
Matt: This opens up slightly more, and you get to see a portion of the mineral growth-- a lot of the moisture that has coalesced into the ceiling has come into a central point, and over time, it just built up these central columns of rock and natural materials. A few pools have gathered towards the base. You see portions of the ground where elements of the acrid liquid that filled the pool over here just dripped in. Whether they began this way or turned by the dragon's presence, you are unaware. But that's as far as you can see.
Liam: Further along the wall, that little rock-- yeah. And just a little bit past it. And then closer to you.
Matt: At this point, you can make out that additional pool of acid, the far back corner and a risen platform, you see the portion of the cavernous stone beginning to mass into a higher level towards the far back corner.
Liam: I listen.
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20. You listen in... Silence. Stillness. The very faint whisper of wind far behind you.
Liam: Around the entire wall. Further, past that pool of acid, even. Further corner.
Sam: Has it been a minute yet?
Taliesin: About half a minute.
Matt: As you come around this corner, being as careful as you can, looking around you-- (impact). Your shoulder hits something.
Liam: Stab.
Matt: Roll initiative.
Liam: I'm going to call it. I mean, mostly I'm 14. I'll take it, that means 19.
Matt: All right. So you have just bumped into the currently invisible form of Umbrasyl lying in wait in the far corner of the cavern. That would be a 20 initiative from Umbrasyl.
Liam: Fuck. You.
Laura: How long has it been?
Matt: At this travel pace, it's been about 45 seconds or so.
Liam: Jenga! (laughter)
Matt: You hear "Jenga!" out of the back of the earring as, let's say the rest of you guys are right here.
Laura: I still want to be stealthed on the broom but I take off into the cavern.
Matt: I assume Trinket is in your necklace?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All right. This is going to be you, with your big stick.
Chris perkins: Awesome!
Matt: Chilling here with the rest of the party. So, at the top of this round, you just hear the growl, the snarl. (snarling) You say "Jenga," blades already at the ready, you go to stab as (swooshing) all of a sudden, you hear this swishing sound of air being cut through at such a speed that it causes a high-pitched whine. Claws and teeth come spinning out of nowhere. You can't even see your attacker but you feel the brunt force behind each of these blows.
Liam: Because it's invisible, is there no Uncanny Dodge?
Matt: No, you've still got Uncanny Dodge on one of the attacks. Just from your roguish instincts.
Liam: Displacer Cloak.
Matt: Correct. It gets disadvantage on the first attack, which is going to be a bite. That's a natural 19, and a two! With the two, that brings it to a 17.
Liam: Nope.
Matt: So with that, you (whoosh) see for a split second, the ripple of teeth snap before you, missing your face by mere inches before they disappear once again. Two more claws (whoosh) towards you. The first one, that's a 19 again and a seven. That's going to be a 22.
Liam: Just hits. Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Oh, your AC would be 20 because you're not hasted right now.
Liam: Oh, you're right. Thank you.
Matt: So that would put you at 18 points of slashing damage.
Liam: Halved to nine.
Matt: Halved to nine. Also your displacement is gone from your cloak.
Liam: For this round?
Matt: Yeah. For the next attack, it's a 19. Misses you? 20? Yeah. The second claw swings through, at this point, from the pain of the first strike of the dragon claw hits you, you back up to the very edge of the cave and duck out of the way as you hear the wind change. As you do, you hear the stone crash behind you as the claw misses you, slamming instead to the side of the cavern wall. It's now your turn.
Liam: I'm going to stay right here. I'm going to hold my turn until one of my friends is on top of this thing and then I'm going to stab it.
Matt: You hold your action until one of your friends is on it and then you move? Okay.
Liam: Not on it, but against it, attacking it. Melee attack.
Matt: So that ends your turn. Everyone else, I need you to roll initiative.
Marisha: Oh, shitballs!
Travis: Balls of shit.
Marisha: Whoa! Percy!
Matt: Your initiative from before was--?
Liam: 19.
Matt: So 25 to 20?
Laura: 22.
Taliesin: 30.
Marisha: He rolled a natural 20!
Matt: (laughs) Percy!
Laura: Are you on the broom with me still?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm hanging so I can drop.
Matt: So that's 20. 20 to 15?
Chris perkins: Another 19.
Matt: Another 19! Nice!
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: 18.
Laura: Nice, Pike!
Matt: So Pike then Keyleth.
Travis: A mere 16.
Matt: Scanlan, what did you get? (laughter)
Sam: I got an eight.
Matt: And Scanlan taking the rear. As you guys hear the crashing of stone at the far corner accompanied directly after the whisper of Vax's cry-out of "Jenga!" you already know shit is going down. Percy, you're up first. Clutching the bottom of the broom that has not moved yet, what are you doing with your turn?
Taliesin: I'm going to drop down. I'll let go of the broom. I'm going to just fire blind where I heard the noise coming from.
Matt: So you're firing in this direction?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: Go ahead and make your attacks at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Disadvantage. That is a 25.
Matt: Due to the massive size of this currently still invisible entity, you do manage to catch an odd bullet towards its form. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Oh my god. Ten points of piercing damage.
Matt: All righty. (gunshot sound) Gun goes off, echoes, little bit of dust comes loose from the ceiling and falls down as you ready for your next shot.
Taliesin: I'll take the next shot. Forget it. Might as well go for it.
Matt: At disadvantage.
Taliesin: That's 20.
Matt: This time, the shot goes the second time (gunshot sound) poofs against some stone in the distance, not hitting its mark.
Taliesin: Third shot for the run. Fucking--
Marisha: Natural 20.
Taliesin: And a one.
Matt: So with that, the third shot (click), nothing emerges from it. And you look down. It's not been a day for Percy.
Taliesin: It's not been a day for Percy. I'm going to start making a dash into the corner there, up in the--
Matt: Not a dash, because you used your action.
Taliesin: No, I'll make a run. Yes, to the wall.
Chris perkins: Is that some sort of weapon?
Taliesin: Not anymore, it's not!
Matt: As she takes her one good arm and cleans out, missing an eye now or maybe missing an eardrum. (laughs) That's going to end your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Oh god, this is a terrible idea. I'm going to roll and hide behind that pillar behind me. If that's okay?
Matt: This one, right here?
Taliesin: Yeah. I've got to fix this.
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: Yes. I'm going to fly on my broom as far in as I can. And land, maybe on that? And just shoot arrows towards where I heard it coming from. I feel like I have one blazing bowstring left, because I used it once in the last battle, right?
Matt: You would still have one more use, yes.
Laura: Okay. Then I'm going to try it through the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Go for it. At disadvantage on this shot, as you cannot see the actual entity. You're firing into the darkness.
Liam: Natural 20. And another natural 20?
Laura: Piece of shit! 19.
Matt: 19? Nope!
Ashley: Oh! War God's Blessing.
Matt: Okay. As your reaction, you guide her-- though the blazing bowstring was unfortunately used on the first attack that missed.
Laura: That was just for the first attack. I rolled twice for disadvantage. So that's the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Okay, I misunderstood. As you go for the attack, you see the actual arrow bursting into flames, not quite sure where to fire. You're about to pull back and aim and Pike shouts to you, putting her hand out. Suddenly, a spark of divine energy hits the front of the bow and corrects its course, beyond your actual arm motion, and you release, based on the faith you have in Pike. The arrow strikes true. You hear a slight growling roar from the distance. Go ahead and roll damage.
Ashley: Strike good and true!
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22, nice.
Laura: On my first attack! If I release Trinket, is that an attack? Or is that a bonus action?
Matt: It would say in the actual item.
Laura: Raven's Slumber. You can make a melee attack. No, that's not it. Bonus action to release it! I'm going to use a bonus action, and I'm going to shout at Trinket to go run towards my brother. I'm going to attack it again.
Matt: You send Trinket out, ten feet in front. Trinket is going to go-- it's 40 feet, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Trinket rushes forward there. You go make your second attack. Trinket goes: (angry bear growls) big old grizzly bear charging into the darkness, growling echoing through the cavern.
Laura: Oh, disadvantage. 27.
Matt: 27 with disadvantage still hits, yeah. Your honed senses to dragon-kind, you can remember the mass, and general size and placement based on the sound you heard from the growls from the first impact you made. You just strike again in the same direction, hitting true. Roll damage.
Laura: 12.
Matt: 12 damage.
Laura: Is that sneak attack because my brother is next to it?
Liam: It's occupied with me.
Laura: So I would have gotten the sneak attack on both those? Or just on the one?
Matt: Just on the one. Yes, I'll allow it because he is currently threatening it. It was a lucky shot. It was a very lucky shot.
Laura: Additional five.
Matt: All righty, good to know. So, total of--
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17. Thank you. Both arrows done. Trinket rushing in--
Laura: I want to duck down if I can, behind that whatever that I'm standing on now.
Matt: You can duck down, but you've used most of your action in this turn to sail in, and you can't hide per se.
Laura: Okay. I just want to duck behind it so I'm away from anything flying at me.
Matt: Makes sense. All right, so we're now at 20. At this point in time, the roar hits (roaring), echoing through the cavern. As the echoing begins to vibrate and the noise doesn't subside, the low hum turns instead to a (buzzing) as seemingly out of the pool of acid, a cloud of biting, stinging insects emerges.
Marisha: He did Insect Plague.
Matt: (buzzing) Floats in this direction, getting the three of you right there. I'll say for the purposes of this that you guys are both in that radius. Anyway, this cloud of insects moves in to-- I need Percy, Shale, and Vex to make constitution saving throws.
Chris perkins: Aw, eight!
Taliesin: 21.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. So you guys both, being dexterous and quick, but also able to maintain your form-- the best you can at this turn-- manage to pull out of the way without too much impact. However, poor Shale is surrounded by the insects.
Chris perkins: Slow and half-deaf.
Matt: You take 12 points of piercing damage as the insects riddle you with bites and stings.
Sam: Shale, do you have any gold teeth or hidden savings accounts that we should also know about?
Laura: She can't hear you, she's deaf.
Matt: At this point now, you hear a few footfalls, Vax. You see a splash in the pool next to you that almost scatters against you, bits of it hitting the edge of your armor, but the armor absorbs the blow, being attuned towards acid resistance. A few other steps as it begins to walk away. I'll allow you to make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage--
Liam: With disadvantage, but-- Yeah, okay.
Matt: Yeah, as you sense that it's moving away, you wildly swing out in front of you.
Liam: Nah. 15.
Matt: 15. Whiffs on air. However, (heavy footfalls) moving forward. A voice comes roaring out into the area, "You dare soil my home after what you've done below?! I will watch you dissolve before I suck down your liquid forms!" I need Vex, Pike, Keyleth, Scanlan, and Percy to all make dexterity saving throws.
Taliesin: Do I not have cover?
Matt: Not enough to prevent this. It's a lobbed stream of liquid acid that comes and surrounds, corroding.
Laura: Do we get advantage on any of it?
Matt: Not unless you have something that gives you advantage on him.
Taliesin: I'm spending a Resolve because that was bullshit. Can I burn another Resolve? Goddamn it.
Matt: Nope. All right, so.
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words to buff my roll?
Matt: You use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.
Sam: But not to-- That seems right, yeah. All right. 18.
Matt: 18, all right. Hold on, I'll just double-check while you're saying this. Just to bring up the ability.
Sam: I should know this.
Matt: It would have to be a damage roll, because there's no attack roll. There's no other roll incorporated on this other than the damage roll.
Sam: Got it. It just happens.
Matt: Right. But it reduces the damage roll, which affects everybody.
Ashley: Wait! I think I cast Resistance. I cast it on Keyleth, I cast it on--
Laura: Me. And I think you cast it on Scanlan.
Matt: It's faded since it's a concentration spell.
Taliesin: Scanlan's got the armor.
Matt: Yeah. If you were to use Cutting Words on this, it would reduce the damage all of you would take from it.
Sam: All right, I will use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.
Matt: What are your cutting words, Scanlan?
Sam: My cutting words are, "Your lower intestine smells like shit!" (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and roll your bardic inspiration die.
Sam: A ten? Shit roll. Three!
Matt: So 18 saving throw. What was yours?
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Keyleth?
Marisha: 14.
Matt: Vex? One. Pike?
Ashley: Seven.
Matt: Seven. Okay, reduced by three, you all suffer 47 points of acid damage.
Sam: Including me, with my acid armor?
Matt: You take half of that.
Laura: Aren't you glad I gave you the armor?
Matt: You take 23 points of acid damage. After its long, angry, boastful diatribe, as it rears back to blow, your words confuse it, and the spray seems a little off-center than what it intended. However, most of you are now currently dealing with the searing pain of the acid pressed against your bodies. Ending that turn, Vax, you're up.
Liam: Did I see where the ejection of acid came out from?
Matt: You did. It came from there, this area.
Liam: Am I still at a disadvantage even though I saw right where that crap came out?
Matt: Correct. Because you don't know if it moved away or not. You don't know exactly where it is. You just know it's somewhere in that vicinity.
Liam: I'm going to throw two daggers at it. I hope that Trinket's near it, but we'll see. So, at disadvantage. Bollocks! That's 15.
Matt: Nope.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22 just hits. Trinket, however, is actually adjacent to Umbrasyl. So you could do sneak attack damage.
Marisha: Whoa! What's up?
Liam: Keen Dagger. It's 26.
Matt: 26. All right. So one dagger just vanishes into the darkness. The other one sticks into the hide for a second before disappearing in a plume of smoke, reappearing at the side of your belt. You hear a low (snarling grunt).
Liam: Can I use my movement to go along the back edge of the cave as far as I can? Directly opposite from my family.
Matt: All right. Looking at the rest of this cavern--
Laura: Look at all the gold, hiding over there!
Matt: There is what seems to be the majority of the funds that were gathered from Westruun, and whatever else of the previous dragon's hoard have currently been brought over to the new lair. Who knows how much has been--
Liam: I thought that was his magic healing spot, but I guessed wrong.
Matt: So, that end your turn?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Now it comes to Shale.
Chris perkins: I'm with insects, right?
Matt: You are currently surrounded by stinging, biting insects.
Chris perkins: Okay. I will stride forth. I'm slow and old. I move 20, so I'll use all my movement, 40, to advance.
Matt: There you go. You come pushing through, brushing them off with your stump and your staff, waving it in front. Angrily growling, you come to rest at the side of this one pillar that juts out of the ground, with Vex right above you.
Chris perkins: I'll dimly look into the darkness and see if I can see, hear, or there's just gray mist in front of my eyes right now.
Matt: You can't see anything. But you do hear right in front of you a growling, snarling bear. You see elements and flashes of the bear that you saw Vex summon forth from her throat.
Travis: And the dagger disappeared into something, right?
Chris perkins: All right. But I can't hear the dragon? At all? It's stomping around.
Matt: It's stomping around a little bit. You saw where the actual projectile came from, so you know it's somewhere in this vicinity.
Chris perkins: Well, you're not very brave, are you? Invisible! Hiding! Afraid to show your face? Taunt it. Oh, bollocks! (laughter)
Chris perkins: Well, that would be a nine.
Matt: A nine. You hear, slowly curling out from the darkness ahead of you, "Bravery means nothing. Survival and victory mean everything!"
Chris perkins: Oh, shut up, you flying suitcase!
Matt: And that's how you end a round. Pike, you're up.
Marisha: Oh, it's something my grandma would say. So good.
Ashley: Yeah. I'm going to hold my action and I'm going to backpack onto Grog.
Matt: Okay. So you move over and leap up onto Grog's back, holding tightly. What's the trigger for your action that you're holding?
Ashley: On his next attack on somebody.
Matt: The next time you sense the dragon is attacking somebody?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: All right. What action are you holding? Is it a spell?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: So you begin preparing the spell. You are now concentrating on it, as you're holding the back of Grog. Okay. Holding that bit, that brings us to Keyleth. What are you doing?
Marisha: If I move through Insect Plague, will I take damage? Or is it if I end in it?
Matt: You don't know.
Chris perkins: I seemed to waltz through it.
Marisha: That's true. You waltzed through it. And you didn't start in it, did you?
Chris perkins: I did.
Marisha: Oh. But you took the damage up top, you didn't take damage again after you got out of it. All right. I want to see if I can move. I'm having a hard time seeing, Matt. Can I get my full movement of 30 feet into this corner here?
Matt: Over here?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You're going to get up around there, unless you want to try and go over the top of the rocks. That way is going to require a climb check.
Marisha: Oh really, I can parkour it? Yeah!
Matt: All right, go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: 14.
Matt: Yeah, it's not too hard. You ran up, grab, leap over the side. You can get right there.
Marisha: Oh, okay. I think the dragon is roughly here?
Matt: In this vicinity. You can see Trinket is currently snarling and lashing out and biting in this area of the cavern.
Marisha: I'm really sorry, Grog. I'm going to cast Faerie Fire, roughly-- Yeah, somewhere where I think he is.
Laura: Why is that bad?
Marisha: Means you don't have acid resistance anymore. It's a concentration spell. But none of us can see him, yeah.
Matt: All righty. So, Faerie Fire. You guys watch as suddenly, this burst of somewhat violet-ish blue light, like a small, tiny explosion of glitter and starlight just hits the area and outlines the entirety of the large dragon Umbrasyl.
Marisha: And with my bonus action--
Matt: Yeah, failed saving throw.
Marisha: Damn right, he did. With my bonus action, I'm going to go into my--
Matt: Actually, you know what?
Marisha: He's going to do his thing, isn't he?
Ashley: You know, you don't need to.
Matt: Yeah, I do. Third and final legendary resistance. You get a glimpse of where Umbrasyl is and then the magic dissipates. Umbrasyl vanishes from sight.
Sam: Shit.
Taliesin: You've burned his third legendary action. You've burned it. It's gone.
Sam: Matt, did it also negate my disadvantage from Cutting Words, on the save?
Matt: He can succeed automatically. It's a choice to succeed.
Sam: Balls. So that's dead, too?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Does he use the legendary action before he fails?
Matt: No. That's true. Yeah.
Sam: So it kills that too?
Matt: It does, yeah.
Sam: Nice. No, my thing's dead too. He double-fucked us.
Marisha: Great. Fuck you, asshole!
Laura: He doesn't save it like that?
Matt: Well, no. Essentially he rolled at disadvantage to make the saving throw. Failed it. And then decided to succeed using legendary resistance.
Marisha: Okay. But it's gone! They're gone.
Ashley: They're gone, gone?
Matt: As far as you know, from previous experience with dragons, there are no further uses of its legendary resistance.
Marisha: What a dick.
Matt: Does that end your turn, Keyleth? It's a level one spell, you still have more up your sleeves if you wanted to try it later.
Marisha: I know. I don't think I'm going to go into my beast shape form so I can do another spell next turn. Can I just tuck and see if I could take a bonus action to hide in this little nook and cranny here?
Matt: You can't use a bonus action to hide, unfortunately.
Marisha: Because I'm not a rogue?
Matt: Because you're not a rogue. Sorry, girl.
Marisha: Can I hug that pillar and say, (panting)?
Matt: You can totally do that. And you are currently hugging in the pillar going, (panting). At the end of Keyleth's turn, it's going to use two of its legendary actions to wing attack. It's going to beat its wings, everything within 15 feet, which right now would only be Trinket, has to go ahead and succeed on a dexterity saving throw. Go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for Trinket.
Laura: I'm going to roll the brown dice for Trinket. Dexterity? 12.
Matt: 12. Okay. So Trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage--
Laura: He's resistant to bludgeoning!
Matt: Because of the armor?
Laura: Yes!
Matt: So takes seven points of bludgeoning damage. However, he is still knocked prone from the blast of wind that whooshes through the entirety of the cavern, causing dust to raise up. The cloud of insects gets shifted a little bit before having to reform back into its place from the sheer force. In doing so, suddenly, there's a rush of air, and two giant slamming sounds, as feet have placed themselves right up front with Shale and Vax. Vex. I've got a lot to concentrate on.
Sam: When I die, I'm coming back as a character named Vix.
Matt: Then you can find another Dungeon Master. All right, so that ends Keyleth's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I take the tiny Pike backpack, and I would like to run along the right, the farther wall from you. Opposite direction.
Matt: This way?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 50 feet, using diagonals to try and get as far around that pool as I can.
Matt: That's about as far as you can get there. So that's movement with Pike on your back. So, that's your movement?
Travis: Yep. And I'll use my bonus action to go into a rage.
Matt: All right. (growling)
Travis: Hey Pike, gimme a slap!
Ashley: (slap)
Travis: (growls)
Matt: Sends you into the rage. You still have your action. Anything you want to do?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: Are you holding your action for any particular thing?
Travis: Well, I can't really hit him from here.
Matt: All right. That ends Grog's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I can't see him, right?
Matt: Not from what you can tell, no.
Sam: Balls. I can see Vex, right? And Shale? Oh, shit. I can't do much without seeing him. Oh, here's what I will do: I'll start by inspiring Shale. I will just step out and sing, (singing) And I will always buff you! And then I will pick a place and cast Stinking Cloud.
Matt: Okay. You take your d10 inspiration die.
Chris perkins: Excellent.
Matt: And Stinking Cloud. Haven't seen that in a while.
Sam: No! Oh well, it's too late, I already said it.
Matt: Stinking Cloud. Where are you setting it?
Sam: Can I have a pointer? Well, I'll just come over. Right here.
Matt: Right there? All right. We'll put this over here to keep track of the Stinking Cloud, we'll just know the insects are in this vicinity as most people have passed beyond it. With that, Umbrasyl is going to attempt a constitution saving throw. Three plus 14, that's a 17. What's the DC?
Sam: 20.
Matt: All right. That will technically be at the start of its turn, but we will carry that over. All right. The cloud appears in this space. You can already hear (coughing). Are you going to move or stay where you are?
Sam: There's no more cloud of insects, yeah?
Matt: It's still in this vicinity.
Sam: Is there any way to avoid it? Move up to where Kiki is or anything?
Matt: Yeah, if you want to make a strength check to climb.
Sam: All right, I'll do that. I'll move up to where Kiki is. 17.
Matt: 17. Yeah, you actually hopscotch up, leap over Percy and get up on top next to her over there.
Sam: Oh, Percy! Didn't notice your bald spot there.
Taliesin: It just grows in lighter.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. With that, it's going to use its third legendary action this turn to attempt a tail attack against you, Vex.
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: You're welcome.
Liam: That's Vix.
Matt: I will stab you. That is a 19 to hit.
Laura: Nope. 20.
Matt: 20! With that, you dodge out of the way. You feel the impact of some large, heavy slam onto the stone right next to you. Pieces of it break off, and then withdraws, barely dodging it in time. All right, that ends--
Ashley: Since he made an attack, can I?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Ashley: I would like to Command him to be visible. Reveal himself.
Matt: What's the word?
Ashley: Reveal! Appear!
Matt: Appear. There you go! Oh, that's cocked. All right. That is a19 plus 11. I'm pretty sure it makes the save.
Ashley: Fuck you!
Matt: Sorry.
Ashley: Do I still get a bonus action?
Matt: That would've been during your turn. You can only hold your action.
Ashley: (snarls frustratedly)
Matt: Good try. Brings us to the top. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Oh god! Okay, I'm going to take a second to try and pray that my second gun doesn't break because that's going to get really ugly! And it doesn't! My gun is fine.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: My gun is fine. But that's it. I'm going to start running straight down, as far as my legs will take me. Not that way, towards the pool.
Matt: Towards the pool?
Taliesin: Right there. Oh no, that's the insects, that's right. So, yeah.
Marisha: As long as you get out of it.
Taliesin: I'm going to roll around to the stone to the right, then. As far as I can go.
Matt: You can get there. You're outside of the insect cloud, not a worry. As you're running, you're cleaning it, polishing, loading it. Okay, looks good.
Taliesin: Oh, yes. I'm going to spend my bonus action to do a quick heal.
Matt: Okay, your Second Wind?
Taliesin: My Second Wind.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Oh, god. That was awful. That's okay. So, yeah. Good. You can move on, sorry.
Matt: Okay. Vex.
Laura: Do I have any kind of sense of-- Ugh, your Stinking Cloud is right there.
Matt: Yeah. You do see some elements of the cloud are displaced in places. It's not showing you exactly where it is, but you are aware that the entity of Umbrasyl is directly in front of Shale, and nearly directly in front of you.
Marisha: Enough to negate the disadvantage?
Matt: No. Not to mention the fact that you are technically in its melee range. So any of your ranged attacks--
Laura: Are at disadvantage again, right?
Matt: Unless it's five foot. Is it five foot, or is it melee? Trying to remember. I think it's five feet. But regardless, it's close to you, it's bad news.
Laura: If Trinket gets up, does that use any of my stuff? Trinket can move freely--
Matt: Trinket can move independently of you.
Laura: So Trinket is going to get up.
Matt: It's half-movement, yeah.
Laura: And he's going to bite Umbrasyl's tail to try to distract him, so I can run between his legs.
Matt: Okay. So Trinket's going to go ahead and-- roll a perception check for Trinket.
Liam: Trinket, snack attack!
Laura: Oh, he's got a keen sense of smell, so he's got advantage on smell perception.
Matt: But there is a Stinking Cloud right there. Roll again. We'll see if Trinket can discern between--
Laura: Well, I rolled a 15. And I don't know what I add to it.
Matt: That would be Trinket's wisdom--
Laura: --oh, perception, seven. So 22
Matt: 22. Okay. Trinket (bear sniffs and growl) runs past here, but can only make 20 feet of its movement because he used the rest to get out of prone. However, strafes aside and begins reaching out and starts snapping, so you want to give Trinket--?
Laura: He's going to attack him.
Matt: Okay. As part of your attack action? Is that what you're doing?
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to have Trinket do one of his attacks so I can move and run.
Matt: As your bonus action on it? Okay, go for it. Have Trinket roll for an attack. With disadvantage because it is invisible.
Laura: That doesn't count? I feel like it still counts, though. It's only 15.
Matt: 15. Trinket slashes out in the air. With the obfuscation of the Stinking Cloud and the invisible dragon, Trinket's just getting mouthfuls of air.
Laura: What does Stinking Cloud do to me?
Marisha: Makes you sick.
Sam: Makes you sick.
Laura: Fuck. I try to run away. I try to run around and run past Umbrasyl.
Sam: You're not in the cloud.
Laura: But I would go through it if I tried to run between its legs. I'll just try to run along to the side.
Matt: On the broom, still?
Laura: Sure! Why the fuck not?! I'm on the broom. Does it matter?
Matt: I mean, that will give you a little more action, you just can't attack from the broom because you'll have disadvantage on your attacks since you haven't finished your set-up yet.
Laura: Jesus. I just want to run, on the broom, and use my bonus action. Is that as far as I can get?
Matt: As far as you can get on your regular feet.
Laura: On my broom, though?
Matt: There.
Laura: And can I use my bonus action to hide? Can I try to hide?
Matt: You are completely out in the open. You have no way of hiding right now. You be can like, "Hide! You don't see me!"
Liam: You can dash and get further away.
Laura: I'm going to dash and I'm going to get further away.
Liam: Rogue bonus action? Hide, dash, disengage.
Matt: Yes, you can.
Laura: Yeah! I'm going to hide behind those things.
Matt: There?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you can get there. However, as you rush by, Umbrasyl does get an attack of opportunity on you. He's going to make a bite as you rush by. That is going to be a 30 to hit?
Laura: I think that hits.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: Isn't it at a disadvantage since he's in smoke?
Matt: Huh?
Laura: Because he's in farts?
Matt: No. That's not quite what it does. (laughter)
Matt: Oh, that's a d10. Sorry. You take 25 points of piercing damage. Plus an additional eight points of acid damage from the inside of its mouth.
Laura: Cool. Tight, tight.
Matt: A total of 33 points of damage as you rush past. All right, that ends your turn, Vex?
Laura: Oh, that it does.
Matt: All right. The insect cloud fades away, insects just dying off and dropping to the ground in piles of currently twitching insects. However, the acid pools suddenly begin to rumble and expand and reach out.
Laura: I'm glad I hid by another acid pool.
Matt: Any creature within 20 feet of the pool has to make a strength saving throw. So that will be Shale, Grog, Pike and Vex.
Laura: Yay.
Chris perkins: Five!
Sam: You have inspiration, if you want to use it.
Ashley: What are we rolling for?
Laura: A strength or a dex saving throw?
Matt: Strength.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23, good to know. Pike?
Ashley: 21.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13. And? Five. All right, so you guys both manage to, as the pool swishes out and comes up to your knees, Grog, and you just pull back and lean against the wall. As the pool subsides back, no immediate effect. Just barely manages to catch you. However, both Shale and Vax are pulled 20 feet into the pool--
Laura: Vex.
Matt: I'm sorry. Vex. I keep saying it now. Over and over again. Pulled into the actual acid pool.
Laura: It's like adding insult to injury. You're going to die and I'm going to call you your brother the entire time.
Matt: Yep. I'm sorry about that. You both are knocked prone and pulled into the water. Because it is an acid pit, you both also suffer 12 points of acid damage. Both Shale and Vex.
Marisha: That's a thing that can happen. All right.
Matt: All right. Now Umbrasyl, who failed the saving throw--
Sam: Gets to spend his entire turn coughing.
Matt: I can't believe Stinking Cloud worked.
Sam: Spends his entire turn.
Matt: The creature spends its action retching and reeling.
Liam: I hope he coughs his innards out the hole in his gut. Dragon hernia.
Matt: Yep. So the action is spent, the dragon is just (coughing), which is good because it rolled a five and got its breath weapon back. But it can't use it this turn because it's coughing and "You-- I will-- " It rears back, about to spit the acid before (coughs) and bits of it come streaming out of the nose, like the milk-in-the-nostrils thing except for it's acid. That's the dragon. Okay. That ends its action. It is going to move out, see if it's-- I forgot to roll concentration for the Invisibility on the last attack that happened. I just rolled a one. With that, it appears once again on the map. The Invisibility spell no longer there.
Marisha: Oh, thank god!
Laura: Now we can watch it kill us.
Matt: It's going to stomp over, out of the cloud, right there.
Sam: Does Trinket get an attack?
Matt: He does, actually. Go ahead and roll for Trinket.
Laura: Yeah, he does! I don't know which one to roll here. They've all been betraying me. 17.
Matt: 17? That misses. Or it hits and Trinket's claws streak across the back of the dragon's hide. No damage sustained. But good job, Trinket. All right, so--
Laura: He's trying, man. He's out. He's so brave.
Matt: He's doing great. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to dart out behind the pillar of stone there. And I'm going to chuck a dagger at it.
Matt: All right. What's the far range on it?
Liam: 60. I'm a Sharpshooter, so there's no disadvantage.
Matt: He's out of range.
Liam: Then I'll move closer. I mean, I know how far I can throw a dagger, so I want to get up close enough to be within range to throw a dagger.
Matt: Still can't get close enough, not with your full movement. You can move 30 feet.
Liam: Where are you? You're in the acid?
Laura: I am in the acid.
Liam: Oh! I'm going to go to my sister, I'm going to drag her out and I'm going to pop the one healing potion I have down her gullet.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm going to pull her behind, so we're both behind that pillar.
Matt: Okay, so you pull her behind the pillar. You go ahead and feed her the healing potion. That is your turn. He dragged you out of the acid pool.
Liam: Potion of greater healing.
Matt: All right, so that is a 4d4 plus four healing to you. That ends Vax's turn. Shale, you're up.
Chris perkins: All right. I'm going to stand up if I can and make my way back onto firm rock. Do I take any damage when I start my turn?
Matt: You do, actually. You take six points of acid damage. You've now stepped up right there. The dragon is fully visible to you.
Chris perkins: Pick on someone your own size! And I whack him on the derriere with my staff.
Matt: Go for it. You have three attacks, correct?
Chris perkins: The first one is a very sad 14. I'm not going to waste the d10 on that.
Matt: Across the hide, no damage.
Chris perkins: Oh my god!
Marisha: No, Chris, no.
Sam: Inspiration?
Chris perkins: Natural one.
Matt: As a level 13 fighter, don't you get a third attack with your action?
Chris perkins: What's that? Oh, yes, you're right. That one, I rolled a 19. I will spend the inspiration die and turn it into a 26.
Matt: Okay. Roll damage with the quarterstaff.
Chris perkins: I do 11 points of whacky-whacky damage and try to bait this thing into turning on me.
Matt: Okay.
Chris perkins: I will also use my second wind.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Chris perkins: To regain 15 hit points.
Matt: 15 hit points to you, go for it. Ending Shale's turn, that brings us to Pike. But at the end of Shale's turn, the dragon is going to use a legendary action to attempt a tail attack against you, Scanlan, as you are the source of the Stinking Cloud that caused it to cough. It goes, (growls) "Foolish bard, get back into my stomach!" And as it whips around, its tail comes streaking overhead and it rolls a natural one! (cheering)
Matt: As it spins around, that's when your staff actually hits the back of its hide. As it does, it gooses it a little, in a sensitive place, and the tail arcs strangely and slams into the stone, next to you, missing you by about six inches.
Sam: Ah! Great. I'll take it.
Matt: Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: All right. (sing-song) I'm going to Guiding Bolt him right up the butt! (laughter)
Matt: You're in the position for it.
Ashley: Yep!
Matt: What level are you casting Guiding Bolt?
Ashley: Third.
Matt: Third level on Guiding Bolt. All right. That will put it at 6d6. So go ahead and roll a spell attack.
Ashley: Natural 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll 6d6 and we'll double it.
Ashley: And double it?
Matt: It's a critical hit.
Ashley: I've never done that before!
Chris perkins: Right up the butt!
Marisha: Monstah! Kill him!
Liam: Kan-cho!
Taliesin: Kan-cho!
Marisha: Kan-cho!
Ashley: Oh my god, 24! One more! So, 50 points.
Matt: 50 points of radiant damage right up Umbrasyl's posterior. Suddenly as Pike, still clutching onto the back of Grog, you reach and grab the symbol of Sarenrae, leaving your sword to the side of your sheath, hold it forward. And as you do, you concentrate, a glowing beam of radiant energy shoots forward just as Shale knocks the backside of Umbrasyl. The tail streaks overhead to hit Scanlan, leaves you a nice, direct shot right at the dragon rump. There's a dull (impact) sound, and Umbrasyl sits straight up for a second (confused noise, explosion) as there's a burst of divine, explosive energy right in the posterior (painful growl). Looking back, there's now a shiny glow, pulsing from the back of Umbrasyl's body. And the next attack has advantage against Umbrasyl.
Ashley: Still alive!
Matt: That's your action. You still have your movement and bonus, if you want.
Ashley: Okay. I think I'm going to stay, and then bonus action, I'm going to throw up a Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: Okay. Where do you want your Spiritual Weapon to go? What level is Spiritual Weapon, Second level? Yep.
Ashley: Yeah. A really large meathook.
Matt: All right. Where are you setting it?
Ashley: Right at his back.
Matt: All right. Sitting right there at the tail of Umbrasyl, this giant, glowing, radiant meathook appears and makes its strike. Go ahead and make your spell attack against Umbrasyl.
Ashley: 27.
Matt: All right. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. It's a 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Ten.
Matt: Nice, all right. Going to stay where you are? Or you going to move?
Ashley: I'm going to stay with my Grog.
Matt: So you're still piggybacking on Grog. Got it. Okay, that ends Pike's turn. Keyleth, you're up. Actually, at the end of Pike's turn--
Ashley: You know what, I'm sorry, I'm going to get off his back.
Matt: Okay. You're staying where you are, though?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so you'll be there. At the end of your turn, Umbrasyl's going to use another legendary action to make a second tail attack at Scanlan again, frustrated by this whole circumstance.
Sam: I'm sure he is.
Matt: That's a 20.
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words?
Matt: You may, if you want to.
Sam: All right.
Matt: It's a natural 20.
Sam: Oh?!
Matt: You could reduce the damage though, with your Cutting Words.
Sam: All right, I'll do that.
Matt: Probably for the best. For that, you suffer 28 points of bludgeoning damage. As the tail swoops down, finding its mark, slamming into you, sending you against the wall of the stonework, and you stumble forward back into place, feeling already the impact of the bludgeoning wound.
Sam: That's a four, so.
Matt: So you reduce that to 24.
Taliesin: That halved? No, that's not halved. Sorry-- brain!
Matt: So 24 points of bludgeoning damage from the attack. However, Umbrasyl's next saving throw is at a disadvantage because of Mythcarver. Now, Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Okay. Faerie Fire (poof) right in front of me. Right on top of him. It gives everybody advantage on attacks against him.
Matt: Yes, it does.
Laura: That's great.
Marisha: I hope he's got enough hit points to make it worth it.
Matt: With disadvantage on the saving throw.
Marisha: Yeah, take it, bitch! Glitter bomb! It's like a Kesha music video.
Matt: So that's a four plus nine because of the disadvantage. I rolled a ten and a four. That will bring it to 13. It does not succeed. You watch as a second burst of purplish energy surrounds Umbrasyl, radiating a glow.
Chris perkins: Who's the prettiest dragon?
Marisha: You're so pretty!
Matt: Gilmore would love this right now. "Fancy dragon! Now we're talking!" You went from being not able to see the dragon to very much being able to see the dragon. All right.
Marisha: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental.
Matt: Okay! Look at you being a druid and shit.
Marisha: Yeah. That's how I roll.
Travis: Get it, girl! Get it, get it, girl!
Marisha: Get it, girl! Get it, get it, girl!
Matt: Water elemental Keyleth. Are you going to stay there?
Marisha: Can I move?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Marisha: Am I in his range of attack?
Matt: You gather, yes. Pretty big range.
Marisha: Honestly, Umbrasyl is so fucking big, I can't see what's going on in front of me.
Matt: You're right there.
Marisha: Is Scanlan in front of me?
Matt: Scanlan is right next to you, to the right.
Marisha: Can I step in the front and shield Scanlan?
Matt: Unfortunately, the cliff ends right there. So you couldn't get in front of Scanlan without dropping onto a lower platform.
Marisha: What about anybody else?
Matt: Percy is down there. You could fill some of Umbrasyl's space but you're not going to be able to guard anybody from an attack, unfortunately. Especially being an entity made of water, not a whole lot of defensive strategy in there.
Marisha: Okay. I'm next to Shale as well, right? We're all in the shit together?
Matt: Shale's over here.
Marisha: Oh, Shale's over there.
Matt: Flanking from the side.
Marisha: You know what, I'm just going to stay there!
Matt: All right. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to run along the side of the pool, and up on his left side, closest to the entrance of the cave. Right there would be delicious.
Matt: There you go.
Travis: I would like to go into a frenzied rage. A regular strike on the first.
Matt: You already have advantage on all the attacks because of Faerie Fire. So you don't need--
Travis: Yeah, not reckless. Not great weapon.
Matt: Yeah. Go for it.
Taliesin: Is that a 20?
Ashley: Oh, oh! That would be a natural 20!
Sam: Oh! That's not going to be good for him.
Matt: Barbarian crits, man.
Travis: I keep rolling, yeah?
Matt: Well, do the damage for the critical, yeah.
Taliesin: This and the next round are going to be really ugly.
Marisha: Kill it. Fucking kill it!
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24. Okay.
Travis: Is the roll and then, what? Double it or add another--?
Matt: The dice roll is? Well, you roll 1d12. What was that, the first d12 you rolled?
Travis: That was a 15. Oh, the dice roll? 12.
Matt: 12. So make a-- it was a 12?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Oh, shit! Okay, that's a 24. And then you add your modifier. And then roll two more d12s. So, that's 24 plus, is that seven?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Plus the two for the axe. Oh my god! That'll be at 33. Plus the necrotic-- oh, fuck! And that's doubled too.
Travis: So that's an 11 for the second d12.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Should we write these numbers down?
Matt: Yeah, we have to now. So it's 24 plus two for the axe, plus seven for the strength.
Travis: Plus five for the necrotic--
Matt: Hold on, getting there. We're getting there. It's getting math crunchy here, guys. So 24 plus nine, so that's 33, plus-- the necrotic?
Travis: Five.
Matt: Times two, which is ten. That's 43, plus the two other d12s, which is an 11. So that's 54. Plus your last d12.
Travis: It's a ten.
Matt: You did 64 points of damage with this one critical hit.
Ashley: He's a monstah!
Travis: Monstah!
Marisha: Monstah!
Laura: Monstah!
Matt: All right. So that's your first attack.
Travis: Yeah.
Chris perkins: Dragon's like, hello!
Marisha: Disco dragon!
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20. The first strike swings wide and slams deep into an already open wound left by a rogue earlier in the sky. This time, the axe sinks deep into its body, and Umbrasyl roars out in immense pain. You see spittle and blood both being jettisoned from its mouth under the sheer pain that it's feeling. You take the axe, and you push even deeper, and push even deeper and withdraw. As you do, the blade is entirely covered in deep purplish-black dragon blood. You swing for a second strike. This time it puts its claw out and catches the axe in the middle of the air. You manage to wrench it free from its grasp, but it turns its head toward you, angrily.
Ashley: Can I use War God's Blessing again?
Matt: That is Channel Divinity? I'll go ahead and double-check here real fast.
Marisha: We also have Heroes' Feast up, by the way, if that makes any amount of difference.
Matt: It won't do anything. It helped you with the temporary hit points, it helped you with--
Sam: Fear?
Marisha: Fear?
Liam: Fear?
Matt: It helped you with the fear-resistance to begin with. That was a big one. Channel Divinity, War God's Blessing and you can Channel Divinity twice. So you can do it a second time, you can. Wait, didn't you use it-- between rests, yeah. You could do it a second time if you want to.
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: All right. So with that, with a plus ten brings it to 30. So, as Umbrasyl grabs the axe, stopping it in mid-air, you just grin, reach forward with the axe, and push it into its actual claw. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: You nasty, boy! 27.
Matt: 27 points of damage. All right. And do you want to use your bonus action?
Travis: I do.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Travis: Let's do it great weapon master, just for kicks.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 26 minus five is 21.
Matt: 21. As you push the blade into Umbrasyl's hand, (angry snarl) it rears back its head and snaps toward you. You duck out of the way, pull the blade back and go for a third strike. This time however, it actually rears its torso up, putting its claws in the air, and you (slicing) find air right beneath it. Does not strike true.
Travis: Cool. Good beans.
Matt: Yeah. That finishes Grog's turn. At the end of Grog's turn, it's going to use its third legendary action to go ahead and make a-- Actually, no, its going to hold onto that legendary action. All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Jesus, it's not dead yet?
Matt: Scanlan, because you took the tail attack earlier, I'll have you roll a concentration check for Stinking Cloud. You have advantage on it though, so add your constitution bonus.
Sam: 20.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine.
Sam: Great. I've got my Stinking Cloud, still. I would like to move the Stinking Cloud. Oh! No, I can't do that.
Matt: You can.
Sam: You can move a Stinking Cloud?
Matt: I think it moves from a short breeze, actually.
Sam: Eh, it's fine.
Matt: Older versions, I think you could.
Sam: I don't want the Stinking Cloud to move. All right, he's right on us, he's got a legendary action. This is not good. Okay, I will reintroduce him to Bigby's Hand, (singing) Bigby's Hand! And I'm going to use it as an-- Ugh, so weak! Interposing Hand.
Matt: Bigby's Interposing Hand, all righty.
Laura: What is that?
Sam: It will block him. It's a talk-to-the-hand move.
Matt: The idea is, you can use your bonus action to set it each turn to what you want it to do. So right now, you're having it as an Interposing Hand. So, yeah. It prevents it from moving--
Sam: Wait, just moving? It can still attack?
Matt: The Interposing Hand interposes between you and a creature you choose until you give it a different command. It stays between the two of you, providing you half-cover against the target. So it helps from ranged attacks.
Sam: Oh. But it won't block an attack. So in that case, I'll just attack with it.
Matt: Okay, so you're just going to go and Clenched Fist?
Sam: I'm going to try to finger it right in the hole that I came out of before.
Matt: Of course you are! Go ahead and make a melee spell attack.
Sam: He's the Bigby and the dike!
Matt: That would be over here
Sam: What do I roll? d20?
Matt: d20, add your spell attack modifier.
Sam: Oh! 27. Oh! With advantage? 27.
Matt: 27, that hits. Go ahead and roll 4d8 force damage, as Bigby angrily jams the magical finger back into the wound.
Ashley: Rage fingering?
Liam: This dragon is being violated in so many ways.
Sam: It's just ten. 4d8 plus what?
Matt: It's 4d8 force damage.
Sam: That's it, ten.
Matt: Ten points of force damage.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Not like this!
Matt: All right, Scanlan, are you going to move or stay where you are?
Sam: If I move, he'll kill me, so I won't. Instead, I will-- where's Vax?
Matt: Vax is over here.
Sam: Way over there?!
Liam: Playing medic with my sister.
Laura: Hey!
Sam: Jesus. Who can I inspire? I guess I'll inspire good old Shale again. You don't need inspiration, you're fine! This is an old lady! I'll turn to Shale and say, I don't normally do this, but I find you so attractive! For an old lady!
Chris perkins: Focus on the dragon!
Sam: I can't! With your eyes-- eye? Eye so beautiful! So twinkling when it looks at me! I just want you to hold me in your arm tonight! (laughter)
Chris perkins: Have you ever had sex? (laughter)
Sam: No!
Taliesin: It was just hanging there!
Sam: Yes, I've had sex, Shale! I have a daughter.
Matt: He says this as a giant Bigby's Hand is just (impact sounds) at the side of a giant, black dragon. That brings us to the top of the initiative round. Percy, it's your turn. Oh my god.
Taliesin: Okay. How close am I to this dragon?
Matt: You are about ten feet from it right now.
Taliesin: I'm walking right the fuck up to it.
Matt: Okay, Percy. You walk right up to the dragon.
Taliesin: I'm pulling out the sword. And I'm going to fucking town, screaming like a little girl the entire time.
Marisha: Kill it! Advantage!
Taliesin: With advantage.
Marisha: All day! Advantage all day!
Laura: Kill that fucking dragon.
Taliesin: 26!
Matt: 26 hits.
Taliesin: All right, first damage. 23 points of damage.
Matt: 23 points of damage, all right.
Taliesin: For shot number one. Shot number two.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies. That's good!
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Marisha: Sorry, excitement.
Taliesin: Ten, 16, 16 times two is 32. 39, that's 39 points of damage. Number three! Oh, it gets worse. I'm going to die. Okay, I can do better than that. No, he can't. 22.
Matt: 22 just hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: That's 18 points of slashing damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Action surge, motherfucker!
Matt: Go for it.
Chris perkins: Going Ginsu on this dragon.
Matt: I know, seriously.
Taliesin: It is not an awesome hit, it's just a hit. I'm really excited. 18 points of damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Shot number two.
Sam: Oh my god.
Taliesin: That's a hit.
Laura: Natural 20?
Taliesin: Natural 20. This is to make up for all these fucking ones.
Laura: Why doesn't Percy just always attack melee?
Marisha: He's bad at it most of the time.
Taliesin: 47 points of damage. Final attack.
Sam: Wait, what?
Liam: How is this possible?
Marisha: Because he's a fighter, he gets three attacks per round.
Taliesin: Plus an action surge for a second attack set of three. So I'm basically going-- Yeah.
Marisha: It's like a John Wu film.
Taliesin: It's just a fucking John Wu attack. Oh my god, it hit. Just barely, because it was a one, otherwise. And that final hit is-- oh, that's good. 27 points of damage, and I'm done.
Matt: As you unload on Umbrasyl, the pent-up anger and frustration, you start slashing over and over again. You guys watch as the blade shines in the air in the presence of its naturally designed enemy. You see at the corners of his outfit little tufts of dark smoke beginning to appear. The scar of Orthax still shows when the fury builds within Percy. As each blow strikes, cutting away hunks and bits of dragon flesh and scale, Umbrasyl is heavily wounded and looking desperate. That ends your turn, I believe?
Laura: Oh my god, he's still alive?
Matt: You guys gave it time to rest.
Taliesin: Fuck it, bonus action, I'm putting on the mask and standing my ground. Fuck it.
Matt: Amazing what a dragon can do in two hours.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: All right. Vex.
Laura: Hi. Okay. I'm going to--
Matt: Actually, at the end of Percy's turn, he's going to use his third legendary action, knowing the source of the Faerie Fire and extremely frustrated by the fact that it has lent to a very difficult round, it turns towards the now water elemental quivering before it, and the tail comes down to smash towards your liquid form.
Marisha: (burbling)
Matt: Speaking of natural 20s.
Taliesin: It's okay.
Marisha: Come on, bitch. Come on.
Taliesin: You're fine.
Marisha: Totally fine. I'm an elemental for a reason.
Taliesin: You are totally fucking fine.
Matt: 32 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: Halved.
Matt: Halved, because of your elemental. Does water elemental have resistance to damage?
Marisha: Yeah, it has damage resistance against acid, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from non-magical weapons.
Matt: All right, so half that. So 32 made to 16. 16 points of bludgeoning damage. I need you to go ahead and roll a concentration check.
Marisha: What did you say?
Matt: Roll a concentration check. So roll a d20 and add your constitution modifier.
Taliesin: Even if it goes, it was worth it.
Marisha: Not bad, not bad. Hang on, sorry. Just my straight modifier, it's not a save? Okay, 18!
Matt: You maintain concentration. You needed to beat the 16.
Marisha: Whoa, daddy. All right.
Matt: Well, half the damage. No, it would've been ten, actually, because it's half the damage you receive.
Marisha: Half the damage I receive, so yeah, I'm good. I'm golden.
Matt: All right, cool. So Vex, what are you doing?
Laura: Oh, jeez. Who all is within five feet of it? Is everybody within five feet of it?
Matt: A lot of them are. Pretty much the whole party aside from Pike, you, and your brother.
Laura: Then I'm just going to attack it twice.
Taliesin: With advantage.
Sam: Oi, Matt. My Bigby's is concentration, so that cloud's gone, by the way.
Matt: Correct, thank you.
Laura: 19 plus 12 hits.
Sam: Did you shoot it in the back?
Matt: Yes, it does. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: As a bonus action?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Good memory on that one.
Laura: 19 on the first hit.
Matt: 19 damage? All right.
Laura: Then the second one hits as well, 17 plus 12.
Matt: Yep. Go ahead and roll damage for the second hit.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. All right. So, ending your turn, comes to the top of the round. Umbrasyl, now gripping into the stone, "I will not fall!" Suddenly, darkness begins to sweep into the area. In this area, a 15-foot radius all completely around Umbrasyl, all of you in this area, your vision goes dark.
Liam: Cancels out Faerie Fire and the golden butt?
Matt: Cancels out Faerie Fire. This is magical darkness.
Sam: It's not a spell, right?
Liam: For those of us on the outside, do we see a bubble of darkness where Key and the others--
Sam: A spell, Matt?
Matt: No, this is an effect of the lair. Actually, Faerie Fire would still affect it if you attacked it, per se, but it doesn't reveal its location currently within the darkness. However, it is technically larger than the darkness. Regardless, all of you guys that are in there, it would negate the advantage you would have from Faerie Fire. It would just be a central attack.
Marisha: So it wouldn't give us disadvantage, it would just be straight rolls?
Matt: A little bit of it's piercing through, because it is magic on magic. However, the rest of you see most of the party disappear into a giant sphere of magical darkness that fills the space.
Laura: So we on the outside, we can't use Faerie Fire? It's just a bubble of dark? Or do we see Umbrasyl peeking out?
Liam: He said he's bigger than the dark, so we see his head coming out.
Matt: You see the wings poking out the sides of it. You still see where he would be. Okay, so with that, Umbrasyl is going to go ahead and take a risk. He's going to lift his wings and head upward to move into an advantageous position.
Sam: No, it's not!
Marisha: Come on. Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm going to say, you leave when Burt Reynolds says you can fucking leave! And I will Bigby's Hand, and I will bring him back down, because I get a spell on his retreat.
Taliesin: I love watching him look at the phone.
Marisha: Consult the helix.
Matt: Unfortunately, you have to be grasping it or grappling it to attempt to--
Sam: No, I get a full spell action. It's my lore feature. I get to cast a brand new fucking spell when he lifts off.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: College of Lore. If he retreats, I get to cast a spell. This is the exact same thing that happened last time.
Matt: Trying to remember how this works. College of Lore. I don't know if it is. Because what you do is you grapple--
Sam: Oh, no, it's a War Caster feature.
Matt: Oh, War Caster! Thank you, that clarifies it. I was like, I don't see this in the College of Lore! You're confusing me! So as a War Caster, when a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an opportunity attack. So yeah, if you wanted to go ahead and attempt to grapple--
Sam: I will grapple him and pull him back down.
Matt: You can totally attempt that. Bigby, go ahead and make a strength athletics check to beat a dragon's strength. Bigby is just slightly under the strength of the dragon, so let's see. It's a roll-off.
Sam: It's a roll-off! Oh my god. This is a critical roll. That's a two.
Matt: It was a 19 on my end. Natural 19. As Bigby's Hand reaches forward, the angry, wounded, frustrated, furious Umbrasyl just kicks the hand away, pulling up.
Taliesin: Do we get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Attack of opportunity from you, you, you, and you.
Marisha: Down, bitch, down!
Ashley: And the Spiritual Weapon, right? And the Spiritual Weapon?
Matt: No, it does not get attacks of opportunity.
Marisha: Without advantage, even though he's retreating?
Matt: Without advantage, because of the magical darkness that has surrounded you guys.
Marisha: Even though he's retreating in Faerie Fire? That doesn't double it?
Matt: The darkness would give you disadvantage, the Faerie Fire negates that. I'm letting you do this.
Marisha: Okay. Letting you do this! Be thankful of what you have! 22 exactly.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: 20.
Chris perkins: My staff bounces right off.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Travis: 23.
Matt: All right, so Grog and Keyleth both get a hit in. Go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Shit. Balls. Low. Shit. Eight damage from the elemental.
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20, all right.
Travis: 25. Plus the necrotic.
Matt: Good to know.
Marisha: And we decided I don't get my fire hands when I'm a water elemental?
Matt: Because that's bullshit.
Marisha: Yeah, all right.
Taliesin: That would just be steam.
Matt: So as you swing out, you arc, and the axe strikes across the back of Umbrasyl's hide. You slam with your water elemental form. The flight is staggered, and barely lands on his feet. Umbrasyl, "I will take you all down!" Unleashes.
Marisha: Here it comes.
Matt: I need a dexterity saving throw from Shale, Percy, Keyleth, and Scanlan.
Laura: Oh, it's that whole table!
Sam: Seven!
Chris perkins: 24.
Marisha: 12.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: All right. Shale actually succeeded on that one. DC 23.
Marisha: DC 23!
Matt: So you take half damage on that one. That's going to be, doing the dice rolls here. So that's 62 points of acid damage down to 31 to Shale, and 31 to you because you're resistant. So 62 points of acid damage to both of you guys.
Sam: My armor, does that do anything?
Matt: Your armor takes it by half, so you would take 31.
Taliesin: 62? Okay.
Chris perkins: Cursed lizard, we're going to give all your treasure to the poor!
Matt: And with that, it takes the rest of its action to move further back at its 80 foot flight, and it's going to end up right about there.
Sam: It's too big to fit in its own house.
Matt: I know! Leaving the Spiritual Weapon there. All right, that's going to end its turn. That now brings it to Vax.
Liam: The twins still have advantage because it's got the Faerie Fire on it, right? You said everyone in it?
Matt: Oh, you need to make a concentration check, by the way, from the damage you just took.
Marisha: Did he get out of the darkness?
Matt: He did.
Marisha: Ooh, ouch, not good at all. What am I making, just a constitution check?
Matt: Add your constitution modifier.
Marisha: I don't think it's going to be enough. Eight.
Matt: The Faerie Fire fades as the acid consumes you, no longer affected by it.
Marisha: Shit.
Matt: All right. Vax, it's your turn. To answer your question, no.
Liam: Nobody's near it anymore, right?
Matt: Nope.
Liam: Okay. I would like to scrabble up behind it, as close to its treasure pile as I can get.
Matt: Okay, that would be about there.
Liam: And I'm going to throw. Shit. No, cancel that. I'd like to run up its tail.
Matt: Okay. You go rushing, clambering onto the back of its tail. It swoops around and sees you doing so, but you're already quick and on it. What are you going to do?
Liam: I'm going to hold my action until somebody gets up on this motherfucker, and as soon as somebody gets close and catches his attention I'm going to stab into it.
Matt: Okay. Good to know. All right, that takes the end of Vax's turn. Shale, you're up.
Chris perkins: I stride up to the dragon and smack it on the nose.
Travis: Atta girl, Shale!
Matt: Speed of 20 feet, you said?
Chris perkins: Yeah.
Matt: You can't quite get to it, unfortunately. That's about as far as you can move this turn. You can dash if you want to, but even so, you still can't quite get to it.
Chris perkins: All right then. I will use all my action to get as close to it as I can.
Matt: Okay, there we go. All right! Ending Shale's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. I didn't realize I was up so quickly. All right.
Chris perkins: Although, actually, I have action surge.
Matt: You do, actually.
Chris perkins: So I will then whack him on the nose.
Matt: That's true.
Marisha: Fuck yes.
Chris perkins: All right, so that's going to be--
Taliesin: I have 13 hit points.
Sam: 13? I thought that said 93.
Taliesin: I count up.
Chris perkins: 22.
Matt: 22, that just barely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Chris perkins: So I whack it for nine.
Matt: Nine points of damage, got it.
Liam: I'm above it. Do I get advantage for that?
Matt: Technically, because you are behind, you are flanking it, so as we'll use the flanking rules for this, you do have advantage on the attack.
Liam: Okay, so, good. 29.
Matt: 29 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24, all righty.
Liam: And is the bonus action gone because of holding the action?
Matt: Correct, yeah, you just get the one action to hold.
Liam: Add one point to that. It was the keen dagger.
Matt: So as part of your action surge, you get two more attacks.
Liam: I didn't add the damage! Add eight to that. Not one, add eight to that. Sorry.
Sam: Add seven more. Then add three.
Chris perkins: Nope, and nope.
Sam: You have inspiration!
Chris perkins: I used it already.
Sam: Goddamn it!
Chris perkins: But thank you, it was very helpful.
Sam: You're useless!
Chris perkins: A fickle lover.
Matt: The one hit, it snorts in reaction to it. As it pulls back, you swing twice more, pretty sure the head was in the same place it was going to be, but unfortunately, meet air. Curse your sight!
Chris perkins: He had a bit of an itch on his back, that's what it was.
Matt: Caught the attention. All right, that brings us to Pike. What are you doing?
Ashley: I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing over to everybody over there. So, Keyleth, Percy, Scanlan, Shale.
Marisha: Awesome. I'm into this.
Chris perkins: I'm sort of right under the dragon. I'm actually quite far.
Ashley: Yeah, she's gone. Who's that down there? That's you, Percy, right?
Taliesin: Trinket.
Matt: What level is Prayer of Healing?
Ashley: I'm going to do it at fifth level. It's a second level, but I'm going to do it at fifth level.
Matt: Within 30 feet of you, so five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.
Sam: You can heal my hand.
Liam: You could also run closer and do it.
Ashley: Okay. Yeah, I'll run closer. And I'll run around, not into the pool of acid death.
Matt: That's as close as you can get right now.
Sam: Is that close?
Liam: It's close enough for Scanlan.
Matt: It's enough for Scanlan and Keyleth.
Sam: Don't do it.
Marisha: Percy needs it.
Ashley: Percy needs it?
Matt: Percy's not in range.
Ashley: Fuck. Can I go the other way around?
Sam: You can go through the acid.
Taliesin: No.
Travis: It was only 12 points of damage.
Ashley: I don't have a lot left. All right, then.
Taliesin: It's okay.
Liam: Do what you can.
Ashley: Okay. Fuck. Can I stay where I was at, then?
Matt: You can. Stay right there.
Ashley: Okay. Sorry, I'm going to not do that. I'm going to Guiding Bolt then.
Matt: Okay. You can just barely make out the position of where Umbrasyl is. You can go ahead and make the attack, but it's going to get cover bonus to the range.
Ashley: Can I peek out? Can I move out?
Matt: You can move here if you want to, and it'll help a little bit. It'll only give it a minor bonus. Go ahead and make your attack.
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: Go ahead and make your spell attack. Is this basic level Guiding Bolt?
Ashley: Basic level Guiding Bolt.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Nope. Doesn't hit.
Matt: You try and reach around and as it's moving its wings about, you manage to strike the stone just blocking half of its form. It splashes with energy and dissipates with no effect, unfortunately.
Ashley: All right. Can I tuck back in?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: And I'm going to move the Spiritual Weapon with my bonus attack, or can I not do that?
Matt: You can do that, yeah. 20 feet? To there.
Ashley: Okay. That's it. That's what I can do.
Matt: Is that as far as you can move it? Spiritual Weapon can move, I believe it's 20 feet. Yeah, that's as far as you can get it.
Ashley: No, 60 feet!
Matt: The range of the spell is 60 feet, but as a bonus action, you can move it 20 feet and repeat the attack.
Ashley: Oh.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I'm up? No shit. Wow. Okay. It's really far away though now, yeah?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Way more than 30 feet, right?
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: What is he? How far away is he from me?
Matt: You're not sure.
Liam: He's about 40 or 50 feet or something.
Marisha: Yeah. You're holding your action for someone to get up close.
Laura: He already did it.
Marisha: Oh, you already did it. Yeah, I guess I'm going to dash and see if I can get to him.
Matt: Okay, what's your movement as a water elemental?
Marisha: 30 feet.
Matt: 30 feet. 60, you're so close. Fucking dragon wings. There you go, you're so close. We'll say you're there, that's fine. That ends your turn, Keyleth?
Marisha: I guess so.
Matt: All right. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to stride over to Bigby's Hand, and can I take out a level-- It's not level two, what do you call it? Not superior, but the middle one.
Sam: Moderate?
Travis: Can I take a moderate healing potion?
Matt: There's healing and then greater healing, so I imagine it would probably be greater healing.
Travis: Can I take the greater healing potion and chuck it to Percy?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Just a toss while standing at Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to catch the tossed potion at that distance.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Matt: You don't even look.
Travis: And I will hold my attack.
Matt: You can keep moving if you want.
Travis: I want to stay right by Bigby's Hand. I'll hold my attack until Bigby's Hand twitches.
Matt: All right. Finishing Grog's turn, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I will inspire Grog with a little ditty that I like to call, Who Let the Grogs Out?
All: Who? Who who who who?
Sam: Who let the Grogs out?
All: Who? Who who who who?
Matt: I'm conflicted in giving that inspiration. Take it, it's fine.
Sam: I can try a different one, if you'd like.
Matt: No, it's perfect.
Sam: And I will pick him up, with his blessing.
Travis: Please.
Sam: And throw him at the dragon.
Matt: Throw?
Sam: Or, you know, send him.
Matt: Okay, so Bigby's Hand will move with you 60 feet.
Sam: You want to go up to his head?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: All right, yeah. He's going up top.
Matt: Okay. We'll go ahead and use some of the platforms today.
Laura: Yeah! Cut his horns off!
Liam: Don't land on me.
Ashley: Kill him!
Laura: Cut his wings off!
Ashley: Tear his head off!
Laura: Jump off those head things!
Taliesin: We have done a lot of damage to this thing.
Matt: Problem with leaving it to heal, man.
Sam: He's only got 400 hit points left.
Laura: He's looking rough.
Matt: Should be more like there, we'll say.
Sam: Release the hounds.
Travis: Can I make two reckless attacks?
Matt: You may.
Laura: Reckless?
Travis: Yes, reckless. I'll use the inspiration die. That's a ten, so that's a 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Sam: Yeah! That helped.
Travis: 23.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26, got it. All right, second attack.
Travis: 24.
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: 24.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: Thank you. 29. I'm not used to that.
Matt: All right. As Bigby's Hand lifts you up, you reach out and swing with the axe, one hit, a second hit, both streaking across the face, the second one actually cutting through one of the eyes. The eye bursts against the blade of bloodaxe, and you can see now the fluids and material that once were contained within are now spilling down the side of Umbrasyl's face.
Travis: Ain't you pretty?
Matt: All right, Scanlan.
Sam: What, me?
Matt: That was your bonus action.
Sam: Oh! Well, okay. I didn't know that. I will try something else then. I will send-- shit. I will send my Lightning Bolt. Can I see any part of him that's not inhabited by one of my allies?
Matt: I'd say there's an arc you could probably hit, yeah.
Sam: Right in the heart?
Matt: Sure. The heart region of the dragon.
Sam: I'm going to shoot him right through the heart with lightning.
Matt: All right. That is a dexterity 21 save, so I'm pretty sure it's halved.
Sam: Yeah, that saves.
Matt: Go ahead and roll 8d6, half damage.
Liam: Shot through the heart!
Sam: I don't know that song, I don't know what that is. I don't know that song. 24, so just 12.
Matt: 12 points of lightning damage. All right. The bolt of lightning bursts through the body. All righty. That comes to the top of the round. At the end of Scanlan's turn, it's going to use a legendary action to strike down, with the tail, onto Vax behind, as you are already in that vicinity.
Liam: Dex save?
Matt: No, this is instead going to be a 26 to hit.
Liam: Yeah, that-- oh, displacer cloak. Did you do that at disadvantage?
Matt: That is instead a 24 to hit.
Liam: That does hit. I'll use Uncanny Dodge, though.
Matt: All right. So what would be 18 damage, you take nine instead from the tail. Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to take three shots from where I'm at. First, I'm going to use my bonus action to chug down that potion I just got. What's the superior worth?
Sam: Greater.
Matt: It's a greater, yes. 4d4 plus four.
Taliesin: 4d4 plus four. Where are my d4s at? I'll just do this four times. 13 points up, so that's a little bit better. All right, I'm going to take shot number one. I'm going to do a called shot to the face. I'm going to hit his other eye. Come on. Natural 20.
Sam: I feel like we need to retire the dice.
Taliesin: Fuck no! No, I love this die.
Marisha: You witnessed it!
Chris perkins: Yeah!
Marisha: You're a third party, it's good.
Travis: Have you and Wheaton ever touched?
Taliesin: Yeah, and I had a really bad day afterward. Let me tell you. That didn't turn out too well. That's just 16 points of damage, and I don't think I get anything bonus for this, he has to make a constitution saving throw.
Chris perkins: Eyeball saving throw.
Taliesin: Or he's going to have disadvantage on all of his attacks for the next turn.
Matt: Okay, that is nine plus 14, 23.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, he's fine.
Matt: Dragons.
Taliesin: I know. It was worth a shot. I'm going to take another shot. Fuck it, I'm just going to go for a sharpshooter, to try and do a little bit more damage to this, and I'm going to burn another grit and get advantage on it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So advantage sharpshooter. And that's a good thing, because that was terrible. And that was also terrible. So I miss.
Matt: All right, second shot. The first one (boom) slams and blasts near the ocular socket of Umbrasyl, shattering the bone, but not actually damaging the eye. The second shot manages to go through the wing, but unfortunately, the area was already damaged, and it's minimal in the effect on the dragon. Third strike?
Taliesin: Yeah, third strike. Here we go. Actually, you know what, I'm going to go for advantage. I'm going to go for sharpshooter advantage one more time, just for shits and giggles. Jesus. Do I call it?
Matt: It fell to the table.
Taliesin: So, yeah, I miss.
Matt: Two other shots, unfortunately, (bang).
Taliesin: I'm going to hide. I'm going to pull top right, and go up. I'm going up and I'm getting the fuck back there, as far back as I can get.
Matt: Okay. End of Percy's turn, going to use another legendary action to slam with the tail once again towards you, Vax. This is going to be--
Liam: This is in the same round, so there's no more disadvantage.
Matt: Correct. 25?
Liam: Sure. And do I blow Uncanny Dodge now?
Matt: You only get one reaction, so yeah. That's going to be 22 points of bludgeoning damage. Whack! The tail comes down and slams into you, putting you face-first into the stone. You can feel the blood run from your nose from the impact as the tail picks back up again. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to attack him a couple times. How about that? No advantage anymore, though, huh?
Marisha: No, it failed.
Laura: 18 on the first one doesn't hit.
Matt: Arrow just splinters across the dragon's hide.
Laura: That first one was way better, I should've kept it!
Matt: What was the second one?
Laura: The second one was 16.
Matt: 16, the second arrow strikes the side of Umbrasyl's face. Unfortunately, once again, the wood shaft streaks across, broken and destroyed by the impact. That ends your turn.
Laura: No, I still have a bonus action, so I'm going to hide with my bonus action.
Matt: Okay, you can do that, roll stealth. Did you add sneak attack? Oh, no, because nothing hit. Sorry.
Laura: Really?
Matt: Sorry, I was trying to be mindful.
Laura: Did you really just do that?
Matt: Trying to help. Failing miserably, but trying.
Laura: Do I still have Pass Without Trace?
Matt: No. Hunter's Mark got rid of that.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Top of the round. Magical darkness fills this entire sphere once more, encapsulating Grog, Vax, and everybody else in the area of the dragon. Vision is taken. You are all considered blind and have disadvantage on any attack rolls.
Laura: Who all?
Matt: Dragon does not seem to be--
Liam: And is it we're blinded, or we're blind where we are?
Matt: Blind where you are.
Travis: Dragon does not seem to be--?
Matt: Affected by it.
Laura: I'm not affected by that, though, because I'm outside of the bubble?
Matt: Correct, yes. Actually, let me see something.
Travis: That dumb grin.
Matt: With a five. Yep.
Marisha: Breath recharged.
Matt: Umbrasyl is going to turn up towards you, Grog. The head peeks out of the darkness for a second, right before it fills your space, and it just says, "I will finish this." You hear a familiar sound of gurgling, and then (liquid spray) out another time. This is going to go for everything in that vicinity. That's going to be Keyleth, Shale, Grog, Trinket, and Percy.
Taliesin: Did I not get cover?
Matt: You couldn't move that far, unfortunately. That's as far as you could go with your movement.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: So I need a dexterity saving throw from all of you guys.
Marisha: Fuck.
Taliesin: Blowing my last reroll. That's better.
Marisha: It's like a 23 save, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Fuck no. I mean, I rolled good, but--
Marisha: But it doesn't matter.
Travis: 18.
Chris perkins: Ten.
Marisha: Six.
Taliesin: That's 20.
Matt: And Trinket? Oh.
Sam: I guess I should do a Cutting Words, just to help a little bit.
Matt: What's the range on Cutting Words, unfortunately?
Sam: Probably 60, 30? Is he further than that? Damn it.
Matt: Unfortunately. The distance of the bard. Just to make sure. 60 feet, yeah. So that's 66 points of acid damage to Grog, Shale, halved to you, and 66 to Percy.
Laura: Trinket's unconscious.
Matt: Trinket is unconscious and dissolving.
Taliesin: I'm unconscious.
Matt: Percy is unconscious and dissolving. Grog?
Travis: I'm good.
Matt: You're good. Hit points.
Travis: I have a question. Because he attacked me, do I get my retaliation attack on him?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Marisha: Kill him, motherfucker! Kill him!
Matt: Shale, what are you at?
Chris perkins: This will depend on this roll. I've got Stone's Endurance, so I'm going to try to use my reaction to reduce the damage, and I reduce it by enough to keep me up.
Matt: Fantastic! She's got grit! She's got perseverance!
Sam: So sexy!
Chris perkins: I'm at two hit points.
Matt: All right, Grog, go for it. Not with advantage.
Travis: It's not reckless?
Matt: The reckless is for your actual attack round.
Travis: The first one was an 18.
Matt: I'm pretty sure it is. Let me double check. Just so the internet doesn't yell at me. It's going to yell at me anyway, it always yells at me.
Taliesin: I believe in you.
Travis: It's a 27, so.
Marisha: This fucker's got to be close to death, right?
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: During this turn, not round, so yeah.
Travis: That was a 27 for the first one.
Matt: 27 was the hit? That hits. Roll damage.
Travis: 18.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: Thank you. 22.
Matt: 22. How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Did the fucking necrotic do it? (screaming)
Sam: Oh, god.
Matt: So. Held aloft by Bigby's Hand, acid sprayed in your face, two of your friends on the ground, unconscious and dissolving, in the center of the dragon's lair, Grog Strongjaw, how do you want to do this?
Travis: I rear back with the bloodaxe and I swing for the hinge right where his upper and lower jaw meet, and I'd like to cleave up under his skull into his brain.
Matt: As you lunge forward, the darkness fills you, but the feral instinct that you've grown up with is enough to know the source of that pain, the source of that acid, is also the source of victory. And as you swing wide, the jaw, still extended from the blast of acid, you push through it, as it's spraying into you, and the sheer force of your blade hits the edge of the jaw, and you push, and you hear from the back of the throat, as the acid is projected, the gurgle of horrible, shrieking pain. (groan) The stream stops as the blade goes towards the base of the skull, pushing forward and upward. You divide the actual mouth of Umbrasyl like that. The darkness (whoosh) flicks out, as you guys watch Grog descending, putting your foot now onto the front of the dragon's neck, you stand up, getting hold onto where the wound is there, still living, the one working eye flitting about wildly, you reach up and grab the edge of the nose, bring the axe up with the other hand, and slam again, and again, and as you do, the eye rolls back. The whole body begins to fall limp as it crumples backward. Vax, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, I am very unconscious.
Ashley: You'll be okay. I've got you.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay, you dodge out of the way as the dragon plummets to the ground. (heavy impact) What was Trinket's maximum hit points?
Laura: It was 60.
Matt: Let me check something here.
Laura: But he was at 53 when he got hit.
Matt: The remaining damage. Yeah, you're fine.
Travis: Night saved.
Matt: Umbrasyl's body hits the ground, the two arms reach up, and the body still continues to pull itself backwards. You pull out of the way. The head lolls around, the jaw now grossly, cartoonishly open, giving out these horrible choking sounds, as the blood and bile and acid all mingle. It tries to talk. The bubbles continue coming forward before it stumbles, the arms sprawled out, its head falls limp to the side as the eye twitches and then falls still.
Ashley: I run over to Percy.
Laura: I run over to Trinket.
Marisha: I drop my water elemental form.
Ashley: I touch Percy and I cast Heal on him.
Marisha: Nice.
Laura: I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket.
Matt: As you stand there, Shale, watching the dragon fall as Grog Strongjaw, the once runt of the Herd of Storms, slams the blade over and over again in the dragon's head, a little part of you is a little jealous, and another part proud, and a little sad that this was not the time for you to lose your life in battle against a mighty dragon.
Ashley: Oh, Shale.
Liam: Can you believe it?
Sam: Shale jumps into acid.
Liam: Just walks in.
Chris perkins: Dissolves.
Matt: (sizzle) I can make that joke in two weeks! As you go and bring Trinket around for a second, using the last bit of the magic that's been afforded to you as a ranger, Trinket comes to. (bear grunt) A lot of the fur has been singed off, and spotted flesh with acid burn, but is conscious and alive, and weak, Trinket leans forward as you're cradling his head and licks the side of your face and tucks his nose into the side of your shoulder.
Laura: You were so brave in here!
Matt: (bear grunt) You go ahead and help Percy get off the ground. You come to consciousness again and you see Pike's hand touching yours as she lifts you. Suddenly, a surge of invigoration hits your body, and you find yourself feeling a lot better than you did a few moments ago.
Taliesin: Yeah, what am I at?
Ashley: 70 hit points.
Laura: That's major.
Matt: Heal, man. Clerics don't fuck around.
Ashley: I saved it just in case.
Laura: Holy shit, Grog!
Marisha: Holy shit, Grog!
Ashley: Grog! I run over to Grog and I jump up on his leg, I'm going to sit on his foot.
Travis: Monstah!
Ashley: Yeah, monstah!
Chris perkins: I will remove my dragon tooth necklace and pass it off to Grog.
Travis: No, Shale.
Chris perkins: You must take this. You've got many more battles left in you. This is going to serve you better than it ever served me. And just so you know, I don't know what the Herd would do, but if you ever go into battle again against other dragons, you know who to call. I'll be ready.
Travis: Yeah. The wielder of the magic stick of nose-whappiness. I will wear this with honor.
Chris perkins: All right. So whenever you, by the way, whenever you spend hit dice to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points restored.
Travis: With the necklace?
Chris perkins: Yes.
Travis: Oh, snap!
Ashley: You what?
Chris perkins: Double your hit points you restore.
Travis: I thought it was bullshit, but it's not! Dope!
Liam: You finally have some hit points.
Laura: You know, if you seek another dragon to kill, you might meet us in Whitestone. We're forming an army there.
Chris perkins: I just might.
Marisha: Keyleth drops elemental form and goes over to Vax and grabs him by the face.
Liam: You'd have to lean over for that.
Sam: He's a little boy!
Laura: It's like kissing a child.
Chris perkins: He's like a little voodoo doll of Vax.
Liam: I'm not pygmied or anything, I'm like a doll.
Laura: Keep it going, Keyleth. Just mug down with him.
Liam: Maybe this should wait till later?
Marisha: I tap him on the face, and say  So glad you're not dead. And I walk away.
Liam: I'm going to shake that off, and then I'm going to do a once around the entire chamber and look around for any traps I can find, especially around that pile up top, but also, I don't know that they'll be here, but see if there's anything like what we saw in Krieg's cave with the crystals in the wall. Little peeky stones.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Can I look for those, too, since dragons?
Liam: 22.
Laura: Oh, he probably doesn't need my help. I get advantage on all dragon things.
Matt: You do.
Laura: It doesn't matter. I rolled shit, twice. 12.
Matt: 12, okay. You guys spend the better part of the next 15 or so minutes glancing around and trying to find any sign of these strange obsidian spheres that were previously in the lair of Krieg, or Brimscythe. After coasting through the crates and barrels, gold piles, the various artifacts and trinkets and things that are strewn about this back corner, no sign of anything like that.
Liam: What about weaponry in that pile of shit?
Laura: What about all the stuff in that pile of shit?
Travis: You want to rage loot?
Matt: There's a lot of things in there.
Liam: I was first on the pile. Are there any weapons in there?
Matt: There are weapons. There are two glaives, polearm glaives. There appear to be a number of pieces of ornamental armor, very beautiful, made of gold and platinum, that were either used for ceremonial reasons or just adorning some sort of popular hall.
Marisha: Keyleth walks over and pulls out her Hunk of Quall.
Sam: Yeah, Quall it up.
Marisha: I'm going to Quall it up all over top of the gold, see if anything lights up with my Wi-Fi detector. Since that's what I feel like it is.
Matt: Strangely enough, no. Nothing seems to glow in the vicinity of the Hunk of Quall.
Liam: And no other blades?
Matt: There are two glaives. Pulling the list up here. Going through the whole hoard, because it is 11:20, we may pick up the actual looting element at the beginning of next session. We'll be here for a while if you want to do that.
Laura: I like the sound of that.
Marisha: We have to go back and get Fassbender.
Laura: Yeah, we're totally going to go back. We're going to return a lot of this gold to Whiterun. Westruun. All the towns.
Sam: Well, all the gold that we can definitely prove came from Westruun, we'll bring back.
Laura: I agree.
Sam: With Westruun markings.
Laura: All the other gold that's just sitting around, I mean, we should probably just take to help the battles.
Travis: Plus it would be nice to give Shale some gold to take back to the Herd.
Sam: Who?
Travis: Shale.
Sam: The Herd? I thought the Herd's-- Okay.
Travis: There was a great remnant. The Herd will live again, and with Shale's wisdom.
Marisha: There were still a few members of the Herd still alive. A good half dozen.
Travis: Zanror's baby mama is still preggo.
Marisha: Yeah, exactly.
Liam: It's also very lean times in Westruun. Most of this gold should go back to Westruun.
Laura: Most of it.
Marisha: Did we contribute any of our own gold into this pile?
Liam: That's back in Westruun.
Chris perkins: I can return with the remnants of the Herd and gather up whatever you don't take.
Laura: And bring it back to Westruun.
Sam: We'll divvy it up later.
Marisha: Let's divvy it up.
Liam: If we take most of the gold that came from Westruun, we're a big pack of assholes.
Laura: I said we weren't going to! We're going to take it back to Westruun.
Sam: You're a tiny pack of assholes right now.
Marisha: Is he still tiny? He's still tiny.
Laura: Three hours.
Liam: Probably another two hours.
Laura: It's only been an hour? No.
Matt: You have, probably another 20, 30 minutes or so before it fades.
Marisha: We need Fassbender.
Travis: Keyleth, you're going to butcher this dragon, right?
Marisha: Yes. 100 percent. I start going to town on it.
Laura: Because this is going to be worth a lot of fucking money.
Marisha: Yeah. Percy, do you have any extra vials? Empty vials for blood?
Laura: We should get some of the blood and put it in the Bag of Colding.
Marisha: Hey, Percy! So glad you're alive and not burning in acid. Do you have any extra vials?
Taliesin: Do I?
Matt: Checking in your various pieces of equipment you have on you, as opposed to what you have stored elsewhere, you had a few vials. They are a little jangly when you reach for them, and you realize they've been crushed.
Taliesin: We have some empty potion bottles.
Liam: I hand mine over from the one I gave Vex.
Taliesin: The one I used as well.
Matt: Go ahead and make a nature check.
Marisha: I'll take that 16 for a 27. Nature check, yeah? 27.
Matt: All right. So as you guys are gathering the elements of this dragon's hoard, gathering the equipment, the art pieces, the relics, all things that were part of this-- and it is, especially since you know, as far as dragon hoards go, especially for an ancient dragon, it isn't huge. And with the recent moving in, you get the idea that this dragon's true hoard probably exists elsewhere. This was either a temporary lair, or was intended to be the new lair, and the process of transitioning hadn't quite begun. Most of the gold here seems to have been what was given to Umbrasyl by the Herd once they had taken over Westruun.
Liam: Maybe he has to give it to Thordak in a dragon pyramid scheme.
Laura: We don't find any of those glyphs like there were in--
Taliesin: We already looked for those.
Laura: Not the circles, I meant the transportation glyph that we beamed into his--
Matt: That you saw in Krieg's lair? No. You do know, from having one made by Allura within your keep before, that they take quite some time to ingrain. Dragon's only really had over a week or so. So, gathering up the materials, the remnants of that hoard, you guys descend down the mountain if you wish, or is there anything else you wish to accomplish within the actual lair?
Marisha: I want to harvest some scales, some blood, and some teeth.
Matt: Right, based on the roll you made. So we have two empty vials that you managed to acquire.
Marisha: Plus he had three in his Bag of Holding.
Liam: Can I help her out?
Matt: Yeah. It's difficult because, with the nature of Umbrasyl's death, as well as being a creature that is naturally caustic and acidic in a large portion of its body, there was a mixing of a lot of the blood that has caused it to become impure while vialing it, so you get three vials of the blood that are still pure and viable. Everything else seems to dissolve through the glass upon contact.
Laura: I can put it in the Bag of Colding, and then it'll keep it.
Taliesin: I can assist with any of the cutting, because I've got the fuck-all sword.
Marisha: I hand the three vials of blood to Vex to put in the Bag of Colding.
Matt: Many dragon's teeth were sundered in the ravaging of Umbrasyl at Grog's furious storm of axe blade strikes. However, you do manage to harvest from the body, unscathed, 14 ancient black dragon teeth.
Marisha: We should make some sweet necklaces. Any scales?
Matt: Quite a lot of scales here, yes. It's going to take you a long time to harvest what you can off this body. A lot of the areas have been damaged from the various wounds and such. How much time do you want to spend to harvest scales?
Liam: Do you think we should just camp here for the night?
Taliesin: We could just camp here for the night.
Laura: As long as the other dragons don't realize that we've just done this. Would I know if they would know?
Matt: You have no idea.
Laura: I don't know if it's actually safe to just hang out in this dragon's lair.
Taliesin: You know what we can do, is we can make the magic mansion in that cave off to the side, in the very back of it.
Laura: That's a wonderful idea.
Ashley: And that magic trap, we didn't set it off.
Taliesin: We haven't sprung the magic trap, either, so that's just none the wiser.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: All right. I'll spend as much time then, I'll stay up as long as I can throughout the night. If I hear any disturbances I'll come back to the mansion.
Taliesin: I'll help.
Chris perkins: Once we get to the mansion, Shale will bid the group farewell and head down to Westruun to let the rest of the Herd know what's happened, about the great triumph of the bearded king.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: As you come down and--
Chris perkins: I'm killed by an owlbear.
Matt: Ravaged and eaten horribly in the Bramblewood, never to be seen again!
Chris perkins: Nobody hears the tale of the bearded king!
Travis: Son of a bitch!
Taliesin: Forever, the Herd will just say, Grog, that asshole.
Marisha: Such a dick.
Matt: No, you come down and as you speak with the remnants of the Herd of Storms, many of which, a number of them did survive the battle, though scarred horribly, and many did lose their life in the battle with Umbrasyl. Zanror, Worra, recovering all right. However, the number's now thinned down to a simple 12 members of the Herd. As you speak with Zanror, he looks to you and says, "Shale. You live."
Chris perkins: Obviously.
Matt: "Have you word of the mountain? The dragon?"
Chris perkins: I toss one of its teeth at him. He will trouble us no more. He is a bygone.
Matt: "Good. Good." He takes the tooth and gives it to Worra. "Well."
Chris perkins: It's the work of those adventurers.
Matt: "Vox Machina, they call themselves."
Chris perkins: They are truly great.
Matt: "Good. We need greatness in this world. We--"
Chris perkins: Don't be so glum, you old fool.
Matt: He grins to himself.
Chris perkins: This is a day of glory. A great battle has been won.
Matt: "It is. But there's been a lot of cost in it, too."
Chris perkins: There's always cost. We will all die, it just depends on how. We died fighting a dragon, and we lived fighting a dragon. What more do you want? That's the smile I want to see.
Matt: "I'm glad you're back, Shale. Your wisdom stays strong."
Chris perkins: Well, now that Kevdak's out of the way, maybe people will listen to what I have to say for a change.
Matt: "We've been talking here. I think the Herd of Storms died in battle with the dragon. There's not many of us left."
Chris perkins: But there are other herds.
Matt: "There are. And while we lost the Rivermaw, I think maybe it's time we went and joined them."
Chris perkins: I like that idea.
Matt: "They're damper lands. Better for raising children. Take a break from all this warring and go back to a simple life. Will you come with us, Shale?"
Chris perkins: Of course.
Matt: "Good. We'll set out tomorrow. At dawn, we plan."
Sam: He's learned!
Matt: You guys set up for the evening, resting your sore, bruised bodies, smelling the ruin of the black dragon as you prepare for an evening's rest, well-earned. We will close this evening's session. Well fought, guys!
Travis: Holy shit.
Marisha: We didn't die!
Liam: Scanlan, is there a hot springs in this mansion?
Sam: There can be whatever you want.
Liam: We need to bathe, soak. We need a good soak to get the stink off.
Matt: It's amazing. You imagine why he didn't mention it before, but Scanlan does indeed have a hot spring in his magnificent mansion.
Travis: It's amazing!
Matt: No, it's magnificent. Guys, a big thank you and round of applause for Chris Perkins!
Chris perkins: Thanks for having me! It's a great honor to be here. Thank you.
Matt: All right, well. We'll pick this back up again next week on Thursday to see what the next adventure holds for Vox Machina now that one of the four Conclave remaining have fallen! I can tell you with the death of one dragon, I doubt the others, upon hearing of it, will be anywhere near as careless as Umbrasyl was. But there are more Vestiges to find, more allies to acquire. Who knows what other dangers lie in the realms of Tal'Dorei and beyond, outside of the Conclave's threat? We shall see in the weeks to come. Guys, thank you so much for staying up with us tonight. Rest well, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week. [end of captions]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone! Close. Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons, rolling dice and shit. So welcome! Always awkward. Anyway, before we get into the game, we're going to do some quick announcements for the evening. First off, we had our recent 100th episode, and I think we have some merch in there. Laura, any updates?
Laura: Oh my gosh, all that crazy merch that we have! We have those posters, you guys, those amazing David Mack posters that look so pretty. The signed versions are going to be in the store for one more week, and the non-signed version is going to be in the store for two more weeks! And that's it, and then they're gone forever. So tell your friends, tell your buddies, tell everyone you know.
Travis: Hide your neighbors, hide your wife.
Laura: That's right. And we also have our Scanlan concert tees and our Slayer's Cake aprons. Our hats are out of stock, but everything else should be in there if you guys want to go check it out.
Matt: Fantastic.
Laura: In the shop at Geekandsundry.com.
Liam: Sold.
Marisha: Word.
Matt: Thank you, Laura.
Laura: Hey, you're welcome.
Matt: That's so sweet. All right, that is that. Let's see, here else. Just a reminder, the Tal'Dorei campaign guide pre-orders go on sale mid-July. You can go to the Green Ronin website for info on that, and it will be released physically bound at Gen Con first, and then it will be coming out weeks after that on the interwebs. Check out Green Ronin's site for all that information! And we're excited about Gen Con insanity, so see you guys there. Let's see. Wednesday Club? Mr. Taliesin Jaffe?
Taliesin: Yeah, we've got something special planned, but I don't know if it's official yet, but I think that we are going to be celebrating Pride Month, and we may have a special guest. I can't say for sure, but we're going to be talking.
Sam: It's Stan Lee.
Taliesin: It's Stan Lee. He's coming out on our show.
Liam: You heard it here first.
Taliesin: He and his pansexual adventures throughout comicdom. Excelsior. It's going to be fun. It'll be a thing.
Matt: Go watch it, true believers!
Taliesin: Possible special guest.
Matt: I love it. Check it out, special guest for Wednesday Club next week. Awesome. Thank you, Taliesin.
Liam: Why limit myself to just one?
Sam: That's Gilbert Gottfried?
Matt: All right. Also, we have Talks Machina Tuesdays at seven PM Pacific time here, on Twitch and Alpha, to discuss what you'll watch tonight on this episode.
Travis: Getting turnt.
Matt: Yes, that. Thank you, Sam. That's okay. Well done.
Taliesin: It's really pleasing in the hand, isn't it?
Marisha: That's what she said.
Matt: And I think that's it. Quick announcements this evening. Nice and quick. I like it. That means we get to dive back into the story here, guys!
Taliesin: Should we mention that we had to reprint some character sheets, or are we not mentioning that? I've now said it online.
Matt: Yeah! A few characters levelled. We have a few folks at 18 now, so that's fun.
Taliesin: Old enough to get in trouble for drinking.
Laura: Do you want to make a special announcement?
Ashley: So, special announcement about my hair. No. There's a time jump in Blindspot, so I'm here.
Sam: Spoiler!
Ashley: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Do they just assume your character doesn't go to the salon and cut your hair? Is that not a thing?
Laura: But they're so pretty!
Ashley: I love them. So much hair!
Liam: Did your character in the time jump go to the Feywild, or go sailing on the sea?
Matt: I'm pretty sure she makes her own bakery cake store. It's going to be great. It's called the Slayer's Bake. Anyway, guys, I think that's it, and that being the case, let's go ahead and hop into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome back. So last we left off--
Laura: Wait, do I put that on my saving throws, too?
Travis: Are you serious?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: We need to share it with the world. Laura just leveled up, and her attack bonus went down.
Laura: Because I was doing it wrong this whole time. Yep.
Matt: Oh boy. Anyway. Last we left off, Vox Machina had discovered the existence of a second ziggurat-like structure on the continent of Marquet, and apparently a cult of the Whispered One there gathering magical artifacts to toss into a second darkened black orb, similar to the one beneath Whitestone, all this time. You ran into Scanlan once more, and leading you guys to where this cavern was found in the mountains of Smouldercrown on the continent of Marquet, you did battle with the cultists there, and seemed to reveal one of the leaders in that group was none other than the not-dead Delilah Briarwood. She fended you off, completed their ritual, and some of their surviving cultists fled into the orb apparently to the other side. You then gathered yourselves, gathered some supplies, your information, and then proceeded to travel through the orb in Whitestone into the Shadowfell, the shadow plane, dark mirror to the Prime Material, where you stumbled upon a partially ruined city that had undergone some sort of ancient siege, and much of it still lies in ruins and disrepair, where you discovered what seemed to be two other siphon orbs existing around the outskirts of this forgotten city, leaving threads of magical energy being siphoned and transferred to a singular black obsidian tower, for whatever purpose the Whispered One, the Undying King, has for this energy. You began to make your way deeper into the city, masquerading as some undead. In the process you killed a few cultists wandering the street, and intimidated one-- Or, I should say, you didn't intimidate. You killed him, and then asked his corpse. I guess that's a form of intimidation. Probably one of the most extreme forms of intimidation, really. Discovering that this city is under the title Thar Amphala. Thar Amphala, you don't know too much about it, other than it seems to be where an ancient battle took place. Much of the undead that wanders this realm carries armaments, weapons, and symbols that seem to be of Pelor, the Dawn Father. You also discovered that there's this tower in the center titled Entropis, where all the magic is being funneled at the moment. Thus, having found this information, gathered your resolve, you continue your trek deeper and deeper into the city surrounding the tower Entropis, to discover what your purpose is here in Thar Amphala. So, Vox Machina, what do you do?
Liam: Figuring it all out.
Sam: Taking five.
Laura: Time out, time out, time out.
Ashley: Just hanging out.
Sam: So we found out that there's a ritual happening soon.
Laura: Yeah, like super stat.
Sam: And there's no day or night here, so who cares, right?
Laura: Right? It's all just night, all the time.
Matt: It's kind of a sunless gray sky. There's some low light, like a very heavy-- Like a very dark, thunderous Seattle.
Ashley: (singing) Hello Seattle! It's a song.
Travis: What song?
Ashley: I think it is.
Matt: It is now. So.
Sam: We have to make our way to the big tower, right? Super fast, and invisibly. Oh, we're also vampire creatures!
Laura: Oh, we look like the gloom stalkers! No, those are the flying ones.
Sam: We look like miscellaneous vampirey things, right?
Liam: Yeah, shambling zombies.
Laura: Scary ghouly creatures.
Taliesin: Extras from a bad zombie video.
Travis: Is Pass Without a Trace still kicking?
Sam: What?
Travis: Pass Without a Trace.
Matt: I would say probably because you haven't cast a spell yet that would've interrupted it, it would be...
Laura: I cast it when we landed here.
Matt: But I don't think you've done anything that altered that concentration yet.
Laura: I don't think so. So it's still going?
Matt: I think so. For maybe another 30 minutes or so.
Laura: Yeah, I didn't Hunter's Mark either of the guys that I attacked.
Travis: And we've got the smoking thing, right? What's it called, the censer?
Laura: Yeah, that thing.
Travis: What is it?
Laura: The smoky thing.
Sam: The censer.
Travis: Is it called a censer?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: First try!
Liam: And we learned that it does something, too.
Sam: It protects you from ghouley deads.
Liam: From ghouley deads, specifically.
Ashley: Will it protect all of us?
Taliesin: I think it's got a range.
Laura: If we stay in this... tight.
Ashley: If we stay tight?
Taliesin: Stay tight.
Sam: So why don't we just walk through the center of town, in the middle of the road, with the censer, and walk into the tower? No? Maybe?
Laura: No. I see nothing wrong with this plan.
Sam: Fly up to the top of the tower?
Travis: Oh, no.
Taliesin: Stay on the ground.
Sam: Teleport somewhere?
Laura: Do you have that ability?
Sam: She does.
Laura: There's no trees on the top of the tower.
Sam: Or we can be smoky mist.
Laura: Then it'll take us a minute to not be mist anymore, and by then they'll realize we're there on the top of the tower.
Travis: Should we take off the robes that they had and pop it on some of us?
Laura: Sure, why not? I mean, we're undead. We look like we're undead.
Taliesin: I think they probably know we're here. I think they probably know we're coming. I think let's just trepidatiously make our way a little closer, see what else is in this town, see if maybe there's anything useful.
Liam: And stay low-key. We don't need to go marching.
Laura: Blend in.
Taliesin: Let's not blow anything up yet.
Sam: But we're making our way to the tower.
Taliesin: Making our way towards the tower, in a towerly direction.
Laura: Are we at full health?
Taliesin: No. I'm not.
Laura: I'm not either.
Ashley: I can help with that.
Laura: Should we take a 30-minute rest and roll some hit points?
Marisha: Did we fight? Oh, no, that's right, we went down going through.
Matt: Yeah, going through the actual portal, the spinning ball of death caused some damage.
Laura: I don't know if there's actually time for that, though, to take.
Taliesin: I'm all right with mine. I'm 20 points down. I don't mind being 20 points down.
Sam: Let's be all full, though. We can be full.
Laura: We're going to fucking potentially fight Delilah Briarwood.
Sam: Yeah, let's be full.
Marisha: I'm assuming it's going to take us some time just to even get there, though, right?
Laura: Is it considered healing as we walk there, though?
Matt: No, you have to take a rest.
Taliesin: Let's get a little closer, then, and survey the situation, and then take a break. I feel like we're a bit far.
Laura: I just don't know if there's time. If she's already started a ritual.
Taliesin: If we run into something on the way there, though, I don't want to be at peak performance yet.
Laura: Yeah. All right.
Travis: Let's move.
Sam: Oh, God.
Marisha: Sure.
Taliesin: This is going to be fun.
Marisha: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?
Matt: You do. For the next 30 minutes or so.
Taliesin: So let's take advantage of this.
Marisha: Yeah, let's at least move for 30 more minutes.
Travis: Who's got the censer in the front? Because we've got to stay together.
Sam: Someone in a robe.
Laura: Oh. Who's in a robe? We're all undead.
Marisha: Are me and you in robes?
Taliesin: We can do robes. I'm all right with robes.
Travis: There's only three of them.
Taliesin: I'll take a robe.
Laura: I'll take a robe.
Marisha: You lead with the censer.
Taliesin: I'll take a robe with the censer.
Matt: Okay, Percy and Vex?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. You both throw robes on over your Seeming-altered undead bodies. Percy, you're carrying the censer?
Taliesin: Yes, I'm carrying the censer.
Matt: And you're all slowly clustered behind them?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: (chanting)
Travis: (chanting)
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: All right. So you guys continue moving, what's very plainly towards the center of the city as the tower stands as this giant beacon of shadow in the center of the horizon. The streets are scattered and broken. You can see there was, what may have seemed almost like a hint of cobblestone at one point, really just looks like largely broken and shattered badlands and dried stone that seems to have been pummeled by impacts of some kind, cracked into small pieces. This is a city by function and function alone. There was very little considered in the beauty of its construction, at least this far out. As you continue to press towards the center of the city--
Laura: I want to keep an eye out, just to see if anybody's noticing. If it seems like people are paying attention to us in a way that they shouldn't be.
Matt: Okay. Well, as you're keeping an eye out, I would like all of you guys to make a deception roll, with advantage.
Marisha: With advantage?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Come on, Gil.
Taliesin: That's not bad.
Sam: 33.
Taliesin: 21.
Marisha: 17.
Liam: 18.
Laura: 17.
Matt: Pike?
Ashley: 22.
Travis: Eight.
Liam: Too big.
Travis: I'm sorry.
Matt: As you guys make your way further down one of the, not major thoroughfares, but one of the general streets that snakes around towards the central area of the city, some of you gently moaning and gurgling as you walk, behind you, you have Grog Frankensteining his way down the street. (laughing)
Travis: Oh man.
Matt: The sound of your rendition, that song. As you're walking, a shadow seems to cross, a large hulking shadow crosses past one of the roads and turns and begins walking your direction. And you see ahead what looks to be about a ten foot tall, thick, burly figure of brownish red flesh, torn, and chains and hooks hanging from it. It looks to be almost like an amalgam of large hobgoblin body parts that have been sewn and stitched together with spikes and iron plates, jutting through, keeping it together at the seams. Where there would be a face, you see instead a giant metal mass that looks like a cage of some kind, and behind it these two glowing beads of yellow eyes poking through, and you watch as it just walks in a straight line (impacts).
Laura: Coming right for us?
Matt: Walking in your direction. Its arms are curled in front of it like a gorilla, its fingers dragging in the dust below it.
Liam: Does it look like it's just happening in our direction, or is it coming toward us?
Matt: It's hard to tell. It's about 60 feet up.
Laura: Is there a road we can turn directions?
Taliesin: Is there a nonchalant way of maintaining direction but getting out of its way?
Matt: There would be enough space to give about a ten foot berth to it as you put your back against the side of one of the nearest buildings and let it pass.
Marisha: Like parting for the queen at the Ren Faire?
Matt: A little bit, yeah.
Liam: Or Taliesin Jaffe.
Marisha: Or Taliesin Jaffe at any party.
Ashley: I move to the side and put my head down.
Sam: What's our ploy if this thing tries to kill us?
Laura: Kill it.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Same old same old.
Matt: (heavy footsteps) You guys all make your way to the side and you watch. It's autonomous, it's not being brought along with anybody. It's running a path down the road. You all move off to the side, and as you maneuver to the side of it, it gets close to the censer you're carrying, and it (groaning) puts its fingers out of the way, actually crushing some of the stonework on one of the nearby buildings to pull itself aside, trying to avoid the billowing of the smoke from the censer. It gives a dull, deep resonant (huff) in your direction as it passes, and then eventually passes by the cluster of you that have all moved to the side, after its head shifts and scans back in the path that it's walking and it moves past you, following the direction you just came from.
Taliesin: Way to be Fonzies.
Laura: Nice. Very nice. So cool.
Sam: Wow. This thing works.
Taliesin: Lot of Fonzies. Smells terrible.
Matt: You continue further into the city. You still hear the distant, low shrieks of the gloom stalkers (shriek) overhead, swooping past in clusters, circling around. Occasionally you watch one or two swoop down and land on a distant rooftop, and you hear the crunching of heavy stone and whatever materials were still remaining on the roof of that structure as it lands and surveys a bit, and then (whoosh) takes off and joins the rest of its kin.
Taliesin: Do any of the buildings look remarkable or interesting? I'm trying to keep an eye out for any building that may have anything inside it of vague importance. Either the building itself is slightly more interesting, or it looks like maybe someone has boarded something up to try and maintain some kind of vigil against the darkness? I'm not entirely sure. Out of the ordinary.
Matt: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: I knew you were going to say that. I'm not good at this. Nope. Nope, nope. That's a four. That's a natural one.
Matt: A lot of these buildings are hard to tell apart when they're all just in this state of disrepair and destruction.
Taliesin: Some of them have doors.
Matt: Some of them do. Some of them have windows, kind of.
Taliesin: Holes where windows might be.
Matt: Possibly. Some, you can't tell if it's a hole, or a window. Or a door? As you press forward.
Taliesin: I felt Orthax take over again.
Liam: So this is Osgiliath, right? It's wrecked ruin, no complete buildings, or are any of them?
Matt: You see some further in. The exterior appears to have been the most heavily sacked. There's been little intent to reconstruct from this point. Like I said, you're still probably a good mile and a half out from the center of the city, and as you walk further in, you can see more clusters of skeletons traveling in groups of 12 to 15, somewhat erratically. You've seen some creatures that seem to walk with an intent pattern, like they have some sort of a sentinel path that they follow to keep watch on the perimeter or the roads of the city. The skeletons that wander, the undead that you see clattering about across the dusty, cracked grounds between the buildings, are erratic, uncontrolled. Mostly it seems to be less intentionally created undead, and more just risen by the nature of the plane you walk, and haven't bothered anyone yet, or at least those who live here. As you begin walking forward, you watch as a cluster of them spills into this T intersection a little ways up, a few of them falling and tumbling and getting back up (cracking). As they cluster together, some of them bang into each other. You hear the clattering of metal from the bits of armor that still cling to their long-rotted forms. Broken bones, some of them are missing arms, or sections of a skull is exposed and cracked open on the side, where you can see what looks to be some sort of long-dried and rotted away gray matter was left to slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard. As you begin to approach that area, they separate a bit and scatter to fill, almost diffusing in the center of this intersection, and then they contract, almost like there's a strange hive mind magic that seems to draw them back together. They're just moving in these autonomous clusters of chaos. You see on them still, similar to the ones you noticed earlier, some of the armor that they're wearing appears to be reminiscent to the armor that the black guard that you battled at the ziggurat earlier had, or similar dark metal, and others have long-destroyed, ruined, scraped and scarred bits of silver and gold armor that are emblazoned with long-ruined and defaced symbols of the Dawn Father, Pelor.
Laura: Does it seem like both of those factions are still-- are they clustered in the same groups?
Matt: They are. And you get the sense that whatever battle took place here long ago was probably between these two factions, and those that were lost in that fray have been risen over time and wander aimlessly through the streets.
Taliesin: Free range undead.
Liam: We've seen long-dead people. This is fucking creepy in the upside-down. (airplane noise)
Sam: What's going on?
Matt: I called the airport to try and coordinate this time with you guys. Cost me 17,000 dollars for that one five-second bit, so enjoy it, guys.
Liam: Worth it.
Matt: Totally worth it.
Liam: These bodies, compared to the ex-champion of the Raven Queen, do these bodies seem even older? More decayed? Do we have any sense for how old these fuckers are?
Matt: You would have to get up close and that would be a medicine check. Would you want to try and make your way close enough to one of these bodies to inspect it enough?
Liam: How far off are they?
Matt: If you guys continue moving forward, you'll be at that intersection in about 30 seconds.
Liam: I'm not going to go. I'll wait.
Ashley: I could go up close with somebody and do a medicine check.
Laura: Keep up near the thing. Everybody get close to the censer.
Taliesin: I'll guide us towards something.
Liam: Yeah, no one poking out ahead for this.
Laura: Hopefully they'll be affected by the censer.
Travis: Let's just stop by.
Matt: So who's moving forward?
Laura: The whole group. So we can all be with the wispy smoke.
Matt: Okay. So you guys make your way towards this intersection.
Laura: We're normal people in robes.
Matt: You also watch as you begin to walk further in that elements of the ground are growing more jagged and craggy. You can see bits of stone and earth are jutting out in large stone spikes, either through some upheaval or elements of the tumultuous landscape long ago that just caused elements of rock to spike outward up five, ten feet in sections. You watch as you grow close to this intersection, about half of the group all at once (groan) turns and looks in your direction and begin to (footsteps).
Laura: Can I just waft some of the smoke towards them?
Matt: Shamble in your direction. The rest of the group noticing-- You begin blowing the censer smoke that way. You watch as three of the closest skeletons make their way into the fume and seem to vaguely lose interest for a brief moment.
Ashley: Since we're close, can I do a medicine check? Are we close enough to?
Matt: Yes, but with disadvantage because of the smoke.
Ashley: Oh, shit. Okay.
Laura: You got this, Pike.
Taliesin: Roll like it's a stealth roll.
Ashley: 13?
Matt: With the brief glances you have, it's hard to really tell. Plus, you're not too familiar with the overall weather of the Shadowfell. You don't know if there's enough weather to manifest as general decay, or if they've been beaten by the ravages of time, if it rains here or not. It's hard to tell. You gather it probably doesn't rain often. They're definitely hundreds of years old. That's the most you can really tell. They aren't fresh dead. These are long dead.
Liam: I'm feeling Foresighty. Can I creep up behind and do the same?
Matt: I will say you can do that, however you still have disadvantage, because she's already taken the roll and you're supplementing her roll in a very short period of time.
Liam: Would that be an even roll, then, since I have advantage on everything?
Matt: You have advantage on everything. I'm giving you a chance to do this when normally you would have none, so the Foresight's allowing you to have a roll with disadvantage. Go for it.
Liam: Oh, that's going to fail. Ooh! 18.
Matt: Or not. Getting a glance at the one nearest to you, the bodies seem to be fairly well preserved for as long as they've been here, so you get the sense that there isn't a lot of heavy weather here at all. And given that fact, the decay that's there, it is reminiscent, maybe not quite as old as the corpse of Purvon when you discovered the tomb originally, but comparatively ancient. At least over 500 years.
Travis: Old Purvon.
Matt: Good old Purvon.
Laura: These skeletons are almost as old as you, Scanlan.
Sam: Good one.
Matt: As you continue to walk forward, and the skeletons part around the cloud of the censer, you push deeper into the city, and they coalesce behind you and follow. They're keeping a perimeter cluster now. They're still being held at bay by the wafting of this thick blackish-green smoke that's billowing off of it, but they're staying just outside of it and slowly shambling at your speed, waiting for an opening.
Laura: I have an idea. What if, right when we get close to the tower, all of these trailing skeletons that we have on us, you just Turn Undead? And then you control them all?
Sam: You can do that?
Matt: Destroy them, yeah.
Laura: Oh, you can't control them? I thought you could.
Ashley: I could turn them.
Matt: Turn them means they just run away screaming.
Ashley: I can make them run away.
Matt: You're at a level where you can just make them explode if they roll low. Up to you.
Travis: We've got a little nuke in our pocket.
Ashley: I want us to be quiet. I don't want to make a big spectacle. Because I can make them go boom boom, but let's just wait.
Laura: She can make them poop.
Taliesin: And they don't even have bowels.
Travis: Is anything stalking us from above while we're moving?
Matt: How astute of you, I was just about to get to that.
Travis: Did you hear that? Astute.
Sam: You put the ass in astute.
Laura: Hey, did you guys know that Travis is the smartest guy at the table?
Marisha: I could tell by his Cheers shirt. (laughing)
Matt: So. In the billowing smoke that's coming around, Grog, because you brought it up, as well as the twins who have relatively high passive perceptions, and Keyleth as well, actually, you glance up and notice that the erratic patterns that a lot of the gloom stalkers take in the sky, there's two that seem to be circling, and circling.
Ashley: I don't like it, I don't like it.
Matt: One of them (shrieks), and you watch as it goes into a dive in your direction.
Sam: Oh, God! In our direction?
Laura: Is there a building we can duck into?
Matt: Make a quick perception check.
Sam: But quick!
Laura: 33.
Liam: 24.
Matt: Okay. Both of you, really quick, you see in two different directions, past the intersection on the right, and on the left, you see two buildings that are mostly still intact. They've sustained some level of damage, but they still have two solid floors, maybe a partial roof missing, but they appear to be structurally sound enough to at least jump into. They both have doors that are partially ajar and a darkened interior.
Laura: And a roof.
Matt: And a roof.
Liam: (grunting)
Laura: (grunting) Why am I? I can talk. Go in that building.
Travis: Yeah, we go in there.
Laura: That way they can't dive bomb us, at least.
Taliesin: I go in last. Censer.
Matt: All right. So you guys all rush into the building on the right or the left?
Taliesin: Yours.
Laura: The right.
Matt: All right, so the one that Vex found. You guys all rush into that building with Percival the last one in there. As you--
Laura: Weapons drawn in case there's something in there.
Sam: But also moving like zombies.
Matt: Okay. Perfect. So as you guys all rush into the building, weapons ready, who's first in the building?
Laura: Me, maybe, because we saw it.
Matt: The two of you guys. Both of you roll perception as you enter the interior of the building. The undead that are clustering behind you are beginning to gather in a semicircle as soon as you hit the inside of the building, and they're clustering at the door as you close it behind you.
Laura: 20.
Liam: 24.
Matt: Okay. As you enter the inside, you look around and you can see what appears to be the remnants of a few tables, very simple tables, that have been shattered and destroyed, broken into ruin around the area. You see what appear to be blades, two left in the wall, one broken off, in the center, that have long rusted over time. You see what appear to be the signs of bodies, blood, dark, dark dried blood circles on the ground, but no corpses, no bodies.
Taliesin: I'm going to use the broken tables and swords to barricade the front windows or holes, I'm not sure which they are, but I'm going to barricade them. And the door, use the sword to jam the door shut.
Laura: Are there dark corners that anybody could be hiding in, or another room?
Matt: The room itself is pretty damn dark. The little bit of light that comes in through the distant, broken elements of the wall, there's enough light where you can kind of-- it's very dim light for you, Percy. Everyone else with Darkvision is all right to make out the interior.
Liam: Cursory trap check, even though it seems unlikely.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: 19.
Matt: No traps from what you can gather at this juncture. But you do hear, as you close the door and begin barricading it with Percival, you hear the multitudes of bony claws, hands, and bits of armor slamming and brushing up against the outer wall that you just came through. The doors (bang) as the undead have now clustered and are trying to push their way in. They seem to have a scent.
Laura: We'll keep the censer near the door.
Marisha: Yeah, I do a little Gust cantrip and put a little of the censer smoke under the door. I'm like an oscillating fan.
Matt: Druids get pretty cool at 18, guys. Just saying. Timeless body, oscillating fan. Best wild shape ability ever.
Liam: Wait till you see the sprinkler system.
Matt: So as you're blowing the smoke from the censer beneath the doorway, it lessens the impacts, but the undead, more than a dozen or so of these, probably about 15 or 16 of them, have spread out, and they're all clustered at that side. The little bit of the fumes that you can push beneath the doorway are only reaching a handful, and it's keeping them from the main door at the moment.
Sam: Can we see outside at all? Is there a peephole or anything?
Matt: There are no windows at the front of this building. You see a sliver where it looks like a portion of the wall suffered some sort of an axe or hatchet impact a long time ago and someone tried to pull their way through. It's maybe about that wide, and that's where the one source of light is coming through.
Sam: I'm going to go over there.
Laura: Wait.
Sam: Oh. Don't do anything?
Laura: I was going to say, what if we turned ourselves into something else and snuck out, and they would think that we're still in this building? Anything that was tracking us.
Sam: I was going to try to make a little diversion to draw them away from the door.
Matt: (boom) You guys hear a heavy impact on the roof above.
Sam: I'll do that. I'll do my thing.
Matt: You hear (boom) what sounds like really heavy footfalls along the roof of the building.
Sam: I'm going to look through the little sliver and I'm going to cast--
Taliesin: Do you want to see what they're burning in the censer?
Marisha: Yes, I do. That's exactly what I was going to do.
Taliesin: I'm going to open up the censer.
Matt: Hold on, just a second.
Sam: I'm going to cast Major Image and make a small little human girl in the middle of the street, crying, bleeding from the arm. She looks disoriented and she's walking towards the other building that we spotted, very sad and (whimpering).
Matt: Okay. As you glance through and create this image, this image appears of this tiny, saucer-eyed French poppet of a girl with a little dress. Her curls are mussed up.
Travis: Dragging her dolly by one arm.
Matt: It's missing one button eye.
Liam: You summoned Cosette.
Matt: Yes, basically. And she goes running off, screaming and crying. You guys immediately hear the shift of the undead beyond the door (rumbling) and begin getting fainter and fainter. As that happens, you also hear (whoosh). Scanlan, you glance out and you watch the shadow of one of the gloom stalkers flying overhead swoop down and attack for the little girl.
Sam: Okay, she's going to run. She's going to book it into that other building to try to get away as fast as she can. And she can move super fast since she's not real.
Matt: This is true. This is actually very true.
Sam: She's like the fucking Flash.
Liam: (singing) There is a lady all in white...
Sam: 120 feet is all I can move her.
Laura: She's sweeping as she's running towards the door.
Matt: Yeah. You can make her move with an action 120 feet. So the little girl goes from (whimper) to (fast running) and goes into a full sprint in a really creepy, Ring-style way. That was for you, Travis. Across the way, and you watch as the gloom stalker swoops up and (impact) slams into the side of the stone building, causing part of it to crush inward and break. The roof partially (rumbling) has to settle and it falls into itself as the creature rights itself (shriek). You now have a much closer look at this entity, and it is billowing black shadow like smoke off of it. You can see glimpses of some sort of physical form in there, but it's so blurry, it's almost like it's phasing between physical matter and dream. You're not sure what it's made from, but you can see what looks to be an elongated neck, some sort of snapping jaw at the end, and two bright, greenish-yellow glowing beacons like eyes at the front of its face. Its wings don't have skin or flesh, it's just dark smoke, and as it flaps, it leaves these trails, these curling bits like black, black, black smoke.
Liam: Are we talking dragon size?
Matt: It's wyvern sized. It's maybe 20 feet from wingtip to wingtip.
Marisha: Is it anything like we've ever heard about?
Matt: No, you have not encountered a creature like this before. But you watch as it glances, and at this proximity, Scanlan, you're the one who's getting the view of this, you watch wherever it looks, its eyes seem to emanate these tiny cones of light, like little flashlights, and as it scans past, the little girl, where the beam goes past, her body is nothing there.
Laura: Is there another door in this building?
Matt: There is on the back side, yes. It's partially covered by what looks to be debris, and it looks like somebody else barricaded the other side, but did not seem to cover both ends before they fell within this building.
Sam: Let's get out of here.
Laura: We should go out the other door as fast as possible.
Travis: I'll take care of that barricade.
Laura: But quietly. We don't want them to know that we're getting out the other side.
Travis: I don't know if I can guarantee that.
Matt: What are you doing, Grog?
Travis: Moving shit out of the way of the door, in a...
Taliesin: Medium pace?
Travis: Let's call it a medium well.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: You are a terrible stage mom, by the way.
Sam: Well, she died.
Matt: She's still there.
Sam: She got her equity card.
Matt: And that's what matters. She's still there, and you watch, the creature seems confused. The eye beams move past it, and the little girl's still there crying and still darting around the area, and the creature's like (snarling), lands on the ground, and comes up and swipes and bites at her, and it goes through her form. You get the sense these creatures aren't super intelligent, but they are effective at seeing through certain glamors.
Laura: They're going to know that we're not. They know we're not zombies.
Liam: Is it still after her, or has it given up on that ghost?
Matt: It's in the process of giving up on that ghost right now.
Liam: Still a cat and a flashlight.
Laura: We've got to go.
Travis: 21.
Matt: At this point, you watch as Grog goes over with his giant mitts and single-handedly shifts the entire pile over with one shove, exposing the door there before you.
Laura: Out the door, out the door.
Matt: You open the doorway.
Sam: Can we leave anything behind, like a dead body or something for them to eat?
Laura: What dead body?
Sam: He's got a ton of them in there.
Laura: Actually, yes. Throw a dead body in the room.
Travis: Who's laughing now, bitches? Dead body!
Matt: And like the world's most macabre flower girl, you produce one of the...
Travis: I birth from the Bag of Holding a dead body.
Laura: And use Dust of Tracelessness as we run out the door, so they don't follow us.
Travis: Who's giving the orders around here?
Laura: Me. Please?
Travis: Okay.
Matt: So as you throw the body behind you, the door's now being slammed a bit. It seems some of the undead wandered towards that illusion, some are still on the other side, and now that you've pulled the censer back from it, the other door's kind of (bangs) coming pushed in. You can see light peeking through. You guys rush out, still with your Seeming illusion on, and you hear, very loudly, almost omnipresent, the screech, the (shriek) of the gloom stalker, right around the corner from you, as it begins to take off just on the other side of the building.
Laura: Should we look for another building we can duck into? To lose their-- So they can't find us?
Liam: Yeah, we can just go hopping from building to building.
Matt: I want everyone to roll a stealth check, please.
Marisha: Do we still have...
Matt: You do. You're getting close to the tail end of it. You have about five minutes left.
Laura: Natural 20.
Sam: Me too.
Matt: Shit.
Taliesin: Thank God we still have a thing.
Matt: So natural 20.
Taliesin: 21.
Laura: Did you add ten?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: 36.
Liam: 39.
Taliesin: 22, I mean.
Laura: Natural 20.
Ashley: 22.
Travis: 20.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: We did not roll well. But we're fine.
Matt: So you all got above a 20. That's good.
Sam: We needed above a 40.
Matt: So you guys rush past and, quick glance around, you find one of the nearby buildings. It's a little more dilapidated, but it seems to have at least enough cover where you can all dive into the shadows and seemingly vanish. You all stand there for a second, and you're super quiet, all breathing heavily (panting), the censer still billowing this awful, awful fume. It's filling your nose, your eyes are watering instinctually from the presence. It stings just to get into your sinuses, but you're all enduring it and trying to be as quiet as possible.
Laura: Is there another door in this building that we can exit out?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'm showing Keyleth what's inside the censer.
Matt: Okay, we'll get to that.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19. It's hard to tell. It looks like where there may have been a door, a portion of the roof in here that has also collapsed, it looks like a giant siege stone, about that big, from a catapult was launched and tore through the roof and shattered that side of the building. The only way out is the same way you came in.
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: Unless you climb up and out. But as you open the censer and look inside, it looks like there is this ember, this cluster of burning, dried herbs. You're not quite sure what it is or where it came from, but it's currently glowing red in places.
Taliesin: I'm going to give some of the herbs to Keyleth to examine. It's like on a charcoal?
Matt: It has what looks to be charcoal stones in the bottom clustered around, and these herbs are placed over it, and it's burning and smoldering over time.
Marisha: Sure. Can I tell what the herbs are?
Matt: Make a medicine check. No, this would be a nature check, sorry.
Marisha: Thank you. Is this something that I would get advantage on for my herb book?
Matt: Yes, you would.
Marisha: 28.
Matt: Okay. I get to look this up.
Sam: Oh, look it up. It's a real thing. Wow.
Matt: It's called Wild's Guide. It's a tobacco-like leaf that was used... It was briefly used for recreational smoking and treatment of small wounds, but it tended to have a very quick diseased, sickening sense to it. Those that smoked a lot tended to get sick very quickly, and it went into disuse from there. It's largely considered to be a relatively useless plant. There isn't a lot of medicinal quality to it. It's just something that exists in herbalism books, as things to avoid.
Taliesin: Comes in green and red, available in the Resident Evil universe.
Matt: You get the sense that them using it for the censer is probably not a widely known use for this type of plant.
Laura: You found a new use!
Marisha: I did! I write it down and I press a flower, or I save some of it. And then can I Druidcraft some more, now that I know what it is?
Matt: From that cluster, I'd say yeah, you can create a little bit more, but very little bit.
Marisha: Okay, I'll go ahead and make as much as I can.
Matt: Okay, so you spend some time there to focus on it, and from the remnants there you can make about twice the amount than what was in the censer, so you have probably a good, solid softball-sized cluster.
Taliesin: The resin's the best part.
Marisha: Okay. I take half, put half back in the censer, and give half to Percy. Does anybody else want some? Actually, should we dab ourselves with it? No, is that weird?
Laura: Maybe just give it to Percy.
Matt: Really? After all that, no dab joke? Anyway.
Sam: Too classy for us.
Matt: I guess so.
Taliesin: Whatever the opposite of standards are, I know we have them.
Marisha: Give some to Percy, anybody else want some?
Laura: Yeah, yeah. I don't have any way to make fire, but I'll take it. Definitely in my shirt now.
Matt: As you guys are doing this, you hear the (snarling), and you hear the (flapping wings). It's hunting from building to building. (impacts) Closer. (flapping wings) (snarling) A little further away. (flapping wings)
Laura: It's gone? Did it fly away?
Matt: Sounds like it, at least.
Laura: Should we leave, and go to another building?
Sam: Let's keep going.
Liam: Building to building toward the tower?
Laura: I feel like it's not really gone.
Liam: Well, we'll find out. Let's make a break for it.
Matt: Okay, who's going first? Okay. Vax, as you dart along the side, glancing up in the air, you can still see. And it looks like there is some communication, because where once there was maybe two, you can now see a lot of them have clustered closer in your direction. There seems to be some sort of an overhead hunt.
Laura: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us again? Are we running out of time on it?
Matt: You're getting pretty close, yeah.
Laura: I'm going to cast it again, just so we don't.
Matt: Okay, so you cast Pass Without a Trace again.
Liam: And are we, Without a Trace and Dust of Tracelessness? That's just a one time...
Laura: Dust of Tracelessness is just so they can't track us.
Matt: So the second thing you've gathered, these creatures are not very intelligent, but they do have some sort of communication between them, and there apparently is a rush on their end to search for whatever was recently spotted. So as you guys make your way, following Vax's lead, down some of the alleyways, and begin slithering through the back ways and the small side streets, avoiding your first attempt to walk straight through the center of the town.
Laura: It's crazy how that didn't work, though. I mean, because it was a really smart plan.
Matt: It worked for a bit. Not every plan is going to hold you to the very end. There was some cleverness to it. So you begin to move through these buildings before-- It would be Keyleth, Vex and Vax. You guys come around one small alley and it opens up into another main road, and this road's hard to avoid. It seems to be almost a circular central road that marks the outer and inner rings of Thar Amphala. But you see there, marking right across this road, a 15 foot tall wall that seems to lock in the inner cloister of the town.
Marisha: How thick does it appear to be?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Maybe we can go under it.
Marisha: Or through it. 17.
Matt: It's hard to tell from this perspective. You have to get a better glance. You have to find if there was a break in the wall anywhere. You do see what looks to be some variation in texture a little ways to the right. It could be a gate, it could be a door, it could be an opening, or it could be some change in its rather solid, not very varied exterior.
Marisha: Go to the gate?
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: Why don't the half-elves go real quick, just to stay small and quiet. No clanking, no crushing. You take a look at the wall, and then we just call everybody up. Just two seconds if it's the way to go.
Laura: Is it far away? It's like 15 feet from us you said? Is it farther than that?
Matt: Probably about 60 feet down to the right of you guys.
Liam: So the change in the wall's about 60 feet, but the wall from our hiding spot is how far away from us?
Matt: Across the way it's about 30 feet from you. it's only about 15 feet tall, it's not crazy big.
Marisha: I'll see if I can discern something here a little bit better. You go. Go check it out.
Laura: Sure.
Matt: So the two of you dart off to the side, following Keyleth's impression of where she saw this shift, and as you make your way along the edge, you glance over and you see two things. One, there does indeed appear to be a small, cut doorway in the wall, maybe about six feet up, three feet wide, that's designed for a single file passage of any creature that wishes to move through. It's open. There's no closed door there. Above it, just above it, about eight feet up, you see what appears to be a deep cerulean blue gemstone, about two feet across, that's embedded within the wall.
Liam: I think it's fine.
Sam: Just go through the hole.
Liam: We're good. We found it.
Matt: It's a big blue stone, about that big around. It's embedded into the wall above the door.
Marisha: I ask them, how thick does the wall appear to be around that side?
Liam: Looking through the door, can we tell how deep?
Matt: Yeah, actually, you can. It's about three feet wide, four feet wide.
Laura: The depth of the wall?
Matt: The depth of the wall, yeah. It's a big, heavy wall.
Travis: Vex, I bet if you go real fast, you can totally make it.
Laura: Good idea, Grog. I'll definitely try it.
Marisha: I can try and Stone Shape through it.
Matt: You two... recognize, at least, there's something very familiar about that stone embedded in the wall.
Travis: It's blue.
Matt: It's definitely blue. It's very similar in size, installation, and functional placement as the threshold crests that adorn the exterior of Syngorn.
Laura: Which are definitely used... Wait. To teleport things?
Matt: The ones that are used to transport Syngorn to the Feywild and back.
Marisha: Oh, weird. Oh no.
Laura: Oh my god, if the ritual finishes, they can teleport this whole fucking city. Shit. We have to stop this.
Marisha: What if we dismantle the gems?
Taliesin: We would probably have to dismantle a bunch of them.
Travis: We're out in the open. Dismantling that's pretty tough.
Taliesin: I feel like it would be easier to wreck the operator than try to break the machine.
Laura: I don't know.
Sam: I mean, we've got a guy who crushes rocks all the time.
Laura: Yeah, but I don't think it's safe to touch those things.
Liam: And the moment he makes a ruckus, the air squad is coming down on our location immediately.
Marisha: Didn't we take some of that crystal? Didn't we take some of that?
Taliesin: Which crystal?
Marisha: Didn't we take shards of it from the thresholds in Syngorn?
Laura: I don't remember. I don't have any in my bag.
Marisha: One of them shattered, and I feel like we took some.
Travis: Yeah, I did.
Laura: You did?
Travis: Yeah, shards of blue crystal.
Laura: Matt's like, uh...
Marisha: I don't know, maybe it's useful in this case?
Travis: It's not pretty, it's all broken.
Liam: One question is, if these stones are used to pull this tower into the main realms, is there another purpose to them here, or is that doorway safe, is what I'm wondering?
Laura: No, that doorway is in no way safe.
Marisha: Where was the gem embedded in the doorway?
Matt: About eight feet up. About two feet above the doorway.
Liam: I feel like we should go through the wall or over it, just on principle.
Taliesin: We can go over it. We do have a magic carpet.
Laura: Yeah, and all the flying creatures are going to see us immediately. We either go under the wall... How far from the wall to the tower is it? Does it seem?
Matt: Probably...
Laura: Can we see the tower through the doorway?
Matt: You can see across, and it's not a straight shot, but you can get low and you can see where it breaks. Since you have a good sense of direction, being the ranger, I'd say you know it's at least under a mile.
Laura: A mile to the tower? So it's probably two miles wide, this whole...?
Matt: Probably less. It's hard to pinpoint directly from what little you can see, but it's definitely within a mile to a half mile of that door, that wall.
Liam: Kiki, would you be able to Great Escape us underneath this wall?
Laura: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. What if we go under the ground all the way to the tower?
Marisha: Is it unworked stone? What's the ground like?
Matt: The ground is unworked stone. It is broken dirt and earth and stone. From what you gather, at the very least. A heavy layer of dust.
Marisha: I could attempt to tunnel us there. Percy, I'm sure you would know more than anyone. What's the likelihood that we might encounter, that I might bust through a dungeon or something, though, over there?
Taliesin: That would be the question. It's A, where do we come up? B, how do we tunnel without collapsing a building on us? And C, what if there's buried dead that haven't been able to break?
Marisha: I can get us under the wall for sure. I can do both, it's just figuring out what we want to do.
Taliesin: If we can tunnel under the wall and then come up in a building.
Liam: I think so. We're not trying to get all the way there, just past this.
Marisha: Okay. Can I Stone Shape--
Laura: From within a building.
Marisha: -- a crawlspace through the wall?
Matt: Yeah, you can probably do that. Let me look at the Stone Shape spell here real fast.
Marisha: Big enough for at least Grog to marine belly through?
Travis: We're all undead, so I'm a little smaller right now, actually.
Matt: Well, you look smaller.
Taliesin: You look smaller than you are.
Matt: You're still your same height.
Taliesin: You would be a little zombie, floating, stuck.
Laura: Can we be zombie cows?
Matt: Stone Shape is instantaneous, and it's a section no more than five feet in any dimension, so Stone Shape would be just a one-hit boom. You could not create a long tunnel.
Marisha: But I can't carve a shape through the wall to just crawl through, five feet?
Matt: Oh, through the actual wall itself?
Marisha: Yeah, through the wall, not under the ground. I want to bust a crawl space through the bottom of the wall.
Laura: Don't you think the flying guys will notice that?
Matt: Yeah, that could work. So do you want to do that?
Marisha: It's not a dynamite blast, it's like a (rumble).
Sam: Yeah, it's just a hole in the wall.
Taliesin: It's like butter.
Marisha: Yeah, it's like butter. So...
Matt: Okay. So you dart across the open road to the other side, where the wall is.
Marisha: Cover for me.
Travis: How would we do that?
Taliesin: We are stealthed.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can I-- Shit, well, you already rolled. Can I have been keeping an eye on the sky and give her a go ahead when it looks like they're not going to see her?
Matt: You begin to do so as she runs across the road.
Marisha: What?
Laura: Just go. Just fucking go.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You hear the distant shrieks, communication between the various gloom stalkers that (snarling) echoing in the sky. You make it all the way across to the wall, and get low, focus, close your eyes, press your hand against the cold, dark wall, and feel it (whoosh) as immediately, you carve a circular tunnel through that goes completely to the other side. Seemingly to no negative effect.
Marisha: Seemingly to no negative effect, I've made a tunnel.
Sam: You sound different. Why are you using weird words?
Marisha: I'm whispering! I'm just trying to be more pragmatic.
Sam: Let's go.
Laura: Hey, guys, we didn't eat a Heroes' Feast yet, either.
Sam: We didn't heal ourselves.
Marisha: No, we didn't.
Taliesin: We've got to get through the wall.
Sam: Let's get through the wall, and then we'll heal.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: He is looking at each one of us and rolling.
Taliesin: He's making eye contact and rolling a die, like it means something.
Laura: I'm not going to look at him.
Marisha: Keeping track. Why is he keeping track?
Liam: If I don't look, he can't kill me.
Ashley: If you don't make eye contact.
Laura: It's like in school, if you don't make eye contact, maybe they won't call on you.
Matt: Yeah, it's the old Warner Brothers rule. So as you guys all, one by one, dart across and leap beneath the tunnel that Keyleth had created, Keyleth, have you gone through the tunnel, or are you seeing everyone else through?
Marisha: I'll wait and see everyone else through, just in case.
Travis: Oh, how generous of you.
Laura: We all are dead.
Matt: You all begin darting through, one after another.
Marisha: I'm going to try and keep a lookout.
Matt: Keyleth, you glance up as, at the very tail end of it, you have Scanlan and Pike at the very end, ready to rush through the tunnel.
Sam: We're slow.
Matt: Because of the gnomish feet. They both get there as you glance up and watch as one of the gloom stalkers (shriek) and goes into a full screeching dive towards you outside of the wall. What are you guys doing?
Sam: Hurrying.
Ashley: Jumping through as fast as our little gnome feet can take us.
Matt: Okay, so Pike, you dart through, Scanlan, you dart through. With the size of the tunnel, it's easy enough for the both of you to just run through while crouching as opposed to having to get on your hands and knees, so you guys start making your way through to the side. Pike, you make it out the other side. Scanlan, you're halfway through. Keyleth, you're still there, ready to go in after as it's about to bear down on you.
Marisha: It's not coming up?
Matt: Oh, no, it's going for a straight dive. It's going right for you.
Marisha: Oh, god, am I trying to do anything but get through?
Liam: You're running! Come on!
Laura: She has to duck down.
Marisha: I don't know, I've got to crawl through!
Laura: Yeah. So do you have protection? Do you have something you could turn into?
Marisha: Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! I'm going to see it and immediately Beast Shape into a little mouse and (crawling sounds) through.
Matt: I want you to roll an initiative roll to see whether or not it gets to you in time.
Sam: Am I rolling, too, since I'm half-out?
Matt: You're halfway in the tunnel. It couldn't fit in the tunnel if it wanted to.
Sam: But, I mean, am I watching this?
Matt: You're watching this.
Sam: I'm going to roll. Okay.
Liam: I'm going to say that I didn't leave the other side of the wall when I realized that she wasn't coming through. So, waiting right in front of Scanlan.
Marisha: 18.
Sam: Two for me.
Matt: Okay. Natural 19 plus three. So, as you shift down into the tiny mouse-like form, its claws immediately slam into and sink into the mouse body. Yeah, that's a 23 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah. Immediately poof.
Matt: How much hit points does your mouse form have? Like one?
Marisha: I'm assuming no more than a kitten's worth.
Matt: Right, so yeah. So, we'll say for the purposes, one. So that would be 16 points of piercing damage, so your form immediately reverts, its claws now fill with your regular Keyleth form. You take 15 points of piercing damage, Keyleth, and you are grappled.
Marisha: Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool story. Cool.
Matt: As soon as it grabs you, it begins to pull you out of the tunnel and lift with you in its claws.
Ashley: Can I grab her arms?
Matt: You're on the other side of the wall. Scanlan's on the other side right now.
Liam: I'm three feet away from you.
Laura: Yeah, but he's in front of you.
Matt: Everyone else on the other side of the wall, Scanlan in the middle, Keyleth in the front. You saw it shriek and dive down, you don't know what happened from that point. You can glance down and you watch as Keyleth is being pulled up. You see that happening. Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: I'll yell to the rest  it's got Keyleth. I'll cast Dominate Monster on it, I guess.
Matt: Okay. So, what's the spell DC on that?
Sam: Well, I was probably not fast enough to pull up my horn, so 20.
Matt: That's a natural four plus three. So, as you say that and turn around, you bring your hand up and begin muttering the incantation and finish it with a flourish!
Sam: I could have just done that this whole time?!
Matt: As you finish the incantation, you watch as a small ring of glowing purple-pink glyphs appear like a crown around the outside, floating about three inches from the gloom stalker's "head." Its shriek goes (intense to calm croaking) and it's just there, hovering in the air, about ten feet up, clutching Keyleth.
Sam: All right. Please deposit her on the other side. Over the wall.
Matt: You guys watch as the gloom stalker (wings flapping) over the wall. Lands on the ground, slamming Keyleth. It slams you into the ground as it lands. You take five points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: (wheezing) You could have told it gently!
Sam: I don't speak Gloom!
Marisha: Five points?
Matt: Yes. You (wham) and almost knocks the wind out of you, and you slam into the hard ground, but the claws unfurl and leave you.
Marisha: (wheezing) I made it, guys! I'm glad you made it!
Sam: Only 59 more minutes.
Ashley: Maybe he can tell the others to leave us alone!
Marisha: Yeah, call them off!
Taliesin: Or maybe there are birds on the other side of the wall.
Sam: Does he keep rerolling for breaking, or is that it?
Marisha: Tell them it's handled, we're dead.
Taliesin: And then we can ride him!
Laura: Ask him if he has any money, and ask him if he can make a good dinner because I'm hungry.
Marisha: Where's the nearest 7-11?
Matt: Each time the target takes damage. It has to take damage to get the save. So, it's under your control for an hour or until it takes damage.
Sam: All right. First things first, please go tell your fellow gloomy friends that the hunt is off. No more flesh down here. And come back!
Matt: (croaking) You can see that it's landed, its giant wings have folded under into these folded knuckle-like claws that hit the ground as it (croaks) and he gets really close and snarls at you. As it gets close, the air gets colder in its presence, it's almost like it brings this drop. It's already pretty cold here in the Shadowfell, but it becomes pretty much freezing as soon as it gets within five feet of you. It seems to suck heat out of the air. As it's glaring at you, (wings flapping) begins to take up. You can see three other gloom stalkers who saw it dive earlier are all arriving towards your location. As it rides up towards them, you hear (gloom stalker speech) and the other ones (gloom stalker speech) snap at it, circle it and they all have what looks like an argument, if there was. And then, eventually, they break and they begin shouting off (gloom stalker speech). You watch as the heavy clusters that had been swarming this area of the town begin to respond in kind. You hear the echoes, the cacophony of various screeches and screams and they all begin to slowly dissipate and diffuse amongst the entire city of Thar Amphala.
Taliesin: Well, that went well.
Laura: Good job, Scanlan.
Liam: Welcome back, Scanlan Shorthalt.
Marisha: Thanks, Scanlan!
Sam: It's good to be back. Okay, we'll need a name for him, obviously.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: So, anybody got any ideas?
Laura: Benjamin is what I'm thinking.
Sam: Benjamin is great.
Marisha: Mr. Mistoffelees!
Sam: That's way better. (laughing)
Taliesin: Can we ride him to the tower?
Sam: Well, some of us can, right? By looking at him, how much can he carry? Or she!
Matt: You're not certain, based on its size, it could maybe carry three medium to small people.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: (whispered) What's around us right now? (regular volume) Sorry, what's around us right now?
Matt: So, as you glance around the other side of the wall, the city is denser within this inner cloister, and the buildings all seem to be newer. Or repaired. It seems like this inner sanctum of Thar Amphala has garnished most of the attention of those that currently reside within its space. As you are glancing up, too, you see the flicker, the faint flicker of the conjoining strands of magical energy that are rising up to the pinnacle of the tower of Entropis where you see these three heavy claw-like fingers that jut out of the top of the tower all curve inward. The flash is in the center of it, it's just glowing brighter and brighter. That pulsing is (pulsing). It's almost like seeing this heartbeat of pure energy that's swelling and swelling.
Laura: I don't think we have time to stop.
Sam: Well, so no more healing. But we could fly right up there and break that thing.
Marisha: Do we really not want to do any other healing?
Laura: Pike can heal us, but we can't rest. There's no time for a rest. No time for a Heroes' Feast. I bought those fucking chalices.
Taliesin: Next time.
Marisha: Might still be useful.
Ashley: How long does Heroes' Feast take?
Sam: Like an hour or something.
Taliesin: It will hardly matter.
Ashley: We can't just take an hour?
Laura: I think that thing is like, going to go.
Matt: It's up to you guys. It's a gradual. It's not like all of a sudden, right now, you watched it pulse. As you've been getting towards, you've been watching it slowly swell. So, who knows.
Sam: Some of us could get on Mr. Mistoffelees and fly around the tower and see if there's a window that we could bust in or something.
Laura: I wonder if Delilah's on the top of the tower.
Sam: Yeah, but we'll be on a thing, so maybe we won't be very conspicuous.
Taliesin: Actually, maybe if we ask Mr. Mistoffelees-- I'm going to never get tired of saying that!-- to go up to the tower, greet whoever's up there, and throw them off.
Sam: It's just a pulsing orb of doom, isn't it?
Taliesin: Just go up there and cause havoc.
Sam: One of us needs to see what's up there.
Taliesin: No, we can just send him up there, and then we can head in through the tower. He can just be a problem.
Sam: He's dumb! What if comes back and he's like 'I don't know!'?
Taliesin: Just say, go up there and if there's anything living up there, throw it off.
Sam: Can't one of us go up there with him to scout it out? Yeah, if someone's invisible. Can't you all be invisible?
Taliesin: Yes, all of us.
Sam: Just me.
Taliesin: Yes, it's just you.
Laura: Can't you make all of us invisible?
Sam: Not while I'm concentrating on Mr. Mistoffelees! (laughter)
Taliesin: I say we head in closer on foot. If you want to ride Mr. Mistoffelees up to the top of the tower, that's one thing. But I think just sending him up there, or sending him to be an agent of chaos.
Liam: I could probably ride him, and if shit goes south, I could get away.
Taliesin: You could always get swallowed.
Liam: By Mr. Mistoffelees?
Laura: By anything.
Taliesin: I get the distinct impression we're going to have options before this day is over.
Marisha: I feel like we're going to have to do a lot of things to stop this.
Sam: We need to get into the tower! We don't even know how to do that!
Liam: We don't know what we're talking about, which is why I think the idea to go scope it out is a good one.
Laura: Does it look like there's any windows on the tower, or is just a big old Rapunzel tower?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: Nope!
Laura: Well, hold on. 19.
Matt: 19, still pretty good. Not a single window. It's a solid tower.
Ashley: Are there any doors? No windows?
Matt: You can't tell from your perspective right now. The base is currently obscured by the very, very dense buildings.
Laura: Ultimate challenge for Vox Machina.
Travis: Should we check one of the buildings, and then we can figure out who wants to go check it out, so we can get out of the open?
Laura: Yeah, let's get in a building and hide!
Travis: Because he's a cleaner!
Liam: The tower, is it obscured by all this shit happening on top of it? Vex can see there's no windows; can we see if there's a rooftop to it at all?
Matt: There is a top to the tower.
Liam: Is it this, is it this, or can we not see?
Matt: The tower gently tapers and then comes to an end. There is a top. You see there's three giant, curled finger-like black spires that curl inward on the outside, inward. And then there's the platform where the tower stops, where it seems like there would be somewhere to stand.
Laura: The thing that's glowing is off of the ground of the tower?
Matt: It's filling up the entirety of that space between the fingers on the actual roof of the tower.
Marisha: What if it has to keep expanding all the way to the crystals?
Travis: What's the nearest building? Is there one building that's closest to where we came through the tunnel?
Matt: Yeah, you guys are about ten feet from the nearest building.
Travis: Can I walk over? Are there any windows?
Matt: This building does not have any windows.
Travis: Does it have a door?
Matt: It does.
Travis: Can I knock?
Matt: (knocking) You watch as an older gentleman with a very thin gray goatee, looks a little sallow, missing his left eye, he currently has a small sack over his shoulder, he opens the door. "Can I--"
Travis: Hey, come here! And I grab his face.
Matt: (muffled yelling)
Laura: Inside! Inside!
Travis: We just go in. Push in.
Taliesin: Well, we're going in now, aren't we?
Liam: And we're walking, and we're walking.
Sam: I'll tell Mr. Mistoffelees to do a 90-second loop and come back down and check in on us because he can't fit in the door, right?
Matt: No!
Sam: Fly around 90 seconds and swoop back down.
Matt: He does a small circle as you guys all rush into the building. You enter the inside. You see what looks to be a lot of building materials. It looks like some of the outer buildings here were used as the storage facilities for what a lot of the city was rebuilt as. There's nobody else inside right now. This gentleman looks like he was on his way out of the building as you interrupted him. As now most of his head is just clasped by your giant goliath Titanstone Knuckle-adorned hand, you see a little bit of his eye peeking over Grog's, and he's like (muffled yelling).
Travis: Shh.
Matt: You see he's got the heavy male pattern-- looks like the old D&D Dungeon Master from the cartoon. He's bald on top, has long gray hair that goes past his shoulders. Very thin, missing the left eye, and he's just limp. He's not even going to fight it.
Laura: Oh hey! We were sent here by Delilah Briarwood. You may know her.
Matt: (muffled yelling)
Laura: Right. The ritual that's happening on top of the tower. How long until that thing's done?
Matt: (muffled noises)
Laura: Blink once for 15 minutes. Blink twice for an hour or more.
Liam: Three times for a bunch of days.
Sam: Maybe he doesn't know.
Laura: Yeah, do you know? Blink once for yes, blink twice for no.
Matt: (muffling noises)
Sam: 15 minutes! No, that was once for 15 minutes!
Laura: No, that was an hour, at least!
Marisha: I thought he blinked before. Are we at an hour and 15 minutes?
Taliesin: I don't think you can call it a blink if you've got one eye. I think it's just a wink.
Marisha: A wink? Man, semantics!
Matt: You get the sense that, as you say that, it does hurt him a little. His demeanor, while already pretty shattered, just even further (sad noise).
Travis: Does he have any pouches on him, or anything in his hands?
Matt: He had a small sack over his shoulder that he was leaving with. He's just adorned in regular--
Travis: Is the sack on the ground now or is it still over his shoulder?
Matt: No, it's currently on the ground. He dropped it as soon as you rushed and pushed him.
Travis: I take the satchel, and I give it to Pike and say: look in here.
Matt: You glance inside. As soon as you grab it, you hear the clanging of metal. You look inside and you can see what appear to be a handful of dark metal shortswords, daggers, simple dried rations, and, in fact, as you glance inside the room now, you can see a lot of the supplies here, aside from construction supplies, you see a handful of weapons that are well-made, recent-made, not seen battle yet.
Sam: They're about to invade.
Laura: What if we burn the fucking city down?
Sam: I mean, sure! What?
Laura: I mean, if they're planning on transporting this whole fucking city, and setting an army loose on our world, why don't we just burn the whole fucking city down? Destroy their rations. Destroy their weapons!
Taliesin: I am excited by this plan.
Sam: Wait, what? No! That's terrible!
Liam: Let's burn down Manhattan. How do you do that?!
Travis: Shall we ask this gentleman some questions? All right. I'm going to remove my hand. Obviously, you're like really cool with the purpose-- perspective of dying, and I'll quicken that if you make a loud noise. Right, like, if you've ever seen, like, Jello mixed with, like apple pudding. That's what I'll do to your head.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Laura: You did your hand signal for Arnold Palmer.
Travis: I did!
Matt: Universal.
Laura: Arnold Palmer?
Travis: 22!
Matt: 22. He doesn't make a sound, more than the gentle trickle out of his pant leg does. (laughs)
Taliesin: I think that's a yes.
Travis: Grab the scruff of his collar.
Matt: Okay, as you release, he (gasps). His teeth are broken and yellow, his one gaping socket is twitching a little bit from the recovery of the sudden, rapid series of events that he was not expecting today. As he gathers his breath, and scratches the side of his leg, "So. What do you wish to do to me?"
Sam: Nothing! We've got to hurry!
Laura: No, really, do you know anything about the ritual?
Matt: "I mean, not the specifics."
Laura: Do you know if it's going to be over soon?
Matt: "I know that some of the acolytes were rushing through, expediting things recently."
Marisha: Why?
Matt: "I don't know!"
Sam: Did they tell you to gather weapons?
Matt: "They just told us to be ready."
Liam: For what? What's the plan here, man? You're really far away from anything fucking nice.
Matt: You watch him close off as you start saying that. He catches himself saying too much information. His demeanor goes cold.
Laura: Please, we know you're going to transport to another plane.
Marisha: You're trying to bail, aren't you? Were you trying to run?
Sam: No, he's joining the fight.
Laura: Oh my god, he was going to leave.
Travis: Well, he's clearly clamming up. I put my hand back over the front of his face, I take the other one, put it on the back of his face, and I start making my fingers touch.
Matt: (muffled groaning) He reaches up and grabs the small symbol, familiar loop with the fork above it. He clasps it in his hand and doesn't resist.
Travis: Do you want it?
Ashley: Yeah! Put him a little lower, Grog. I rip off the necklace.
Matt: He's like clasping it in his hand. Make a strength check.
Taliesin: Drop it! Drop it!
Ashley: Oh my god, we're so terrible!
Travis: Are we?
Ashley: Natural 20!
Matt: He's clasping it, and you can see his one eye rolls back to hold onto it and he's muttering a prayer beneath your fingers and he's (muffled muttering) and you tear it from his grasp. (muffled panic)
Ashley: We'll give it back! You've got to answer some questions for us.
Travis: No, he won't. Look away if you want to preserve anything, and I just squish his head.
Matt: As you're saying that, you watch as one eye opens and his hands go limp and then (face exploding) and it just (splattering).
Ashley: Grog!
Matt: Spray on Pike.
Travis: I thought you were me giving the signal like, end it!
Ashley: No! I was going to-- whatever.
Travis: All right. We'll work on it.
Ashley: We'll find another one. It's okay.
Travis: Yeah, I'm really sorry. Sorry.
Ashley: Brains!
Liam: Pike got Dragon Aged.
Matt: Yeah!
Marisha: Is there a water bucket around?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: So, but, set fire to the house, right? Burn the whole city down?
Sam: No!
Marisha: 11.
Taliesin: The city is mostly stone; I don't know if we can burn it down.
Matt: As you're having this conversation, you do find a small basin that's filled up with water. The people that live in this city still need to live. It looks like there are the means of feeding and drinking, though you get the sense that they may or may not-- most of the supplies do come from outside the Shadowfell.
Laura: Let's poison the water supply!
Marisha: I take a little bit of the water and control it and let Pike wash off a little bit.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I think I got a little in my mouth (gagging).
Liam: Wait, there's a little bit of skull right there. All right.
Taliesin: That's the little chunk where the joint is. It's just this little bit, it just breaks naturally if you put pressure on that side.
Matt: There's this slumped pile of dark cloth, thin body, and Riki-Oh mess on the ground.
Taliesin: (laughs) Wow! Way to bring that back!
Matt: So, what's the plan, guys?
Taliesin: We've got a little shadow creature coming back around in a moment.
Sam: Want to jump on and do a scouting pass?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: You guys do the scout, we'll heal?
Ashley: You guys, are we not going to do a Heroes' Feast?
Laura: It's an hour. It takes an hour, right?
Sam: We can't risk it.
Liam: What do you think's going to happen in an hour? Everything's going to kick off in an hour?
Sam: Wouldn't you hate to miss it by 15 minutes?
Laura: The pulse has gotten stronger since we've been here. I don't know if that pulse means it's about to go, or if the pulse means that it's five minutes in.
Sam: This guy was about to leave his house to go walk over there for the final part of the ritual.
Marisha: Or he was trying to bail before the final part of the ritual.
Liam: Where's your pet? Let's go find some shit out.
Marisha: He had rations! No one takes rations!
Laura: He was handing out weapons.
Taliesin: It was like Carpentry of the Damned sort of thing.
Marisha: What if the giant orb has to reach the crystals?
Taliesin: It might, but it might just do the (buzzing, exploding).
Laura: Technical terms.
Marisha: Yeah, the (buzzing, exploding).
Taliesin: It's magic, it's the best I've got.
Travis: Who's going up?
Sam: Me and Vax.
Travis: Just you two, okay.
Ashley: How's everybody doing right now?
Taliesin: I'm a little rough.
Marisha: I'm a little rough.
Taliesin: I could use 20 points.
Laura: Yeah, I could use 20 points.
Ashley: Let's do a little Mass Cure Wounds situation.
Marisha: Nice.
Travis: Do it!
Sam: But do it with a flair! (laughter)
Ashley: Oh, fudge.
Laura: What? Oh that's a one, not seven, isn't it?
Ashley: 13.
Laura: That's fine, that's fine!
Taliesin: We're taking a short rest; I can add my--
Matt: Are you guys taking a short rest?
Laura: Well, while they fly up, is it enough time for the people staying in the house to heal a bit?
Matt: You guys could take a short rest during that time, if you want to do a full scoping. By the time you come back, that spell's about to fade.
Sam: I mean, yeah, we're going to go as fast as we can.
Matt: So those that are traveling can't take a short rest.
Travis: And if that fades, he's fully aware that he was dominated, right?
Matt: Well. You don't know.
Travis: Okay. Especially me.
Matt: Yeah, you especially don't know.
Liam: Time's a-wasting, Scanlan, let's go.
Sam: Let's go. Mr. Mistoffelees!
Matt: As you open the door, there, just landing (landing) (gloom stalker croaking). You guys climb onto its back?
Sam: Yes, we do!
Matt: You climb onto its back. Touching this creature is like touching the inside of a freezer. Even with gauntleted hands, you have to wrap some of your cloth around to not give yourself frostbite over a period of time. Even resting on it, especially with your leather armors, it chills you to the bone. As you take up, and even just ten, 15 minutes into (wings flapping) up into the air, gathering as to whether you'll be noticed or spotted by this, you can feel it beginning to chill you, your teeth are beginning to chatter from being in that proximity of the freezing cold creature. It's strange, as you touch it, it feels less like fur and flesh and more like you're grabbing onto a very, very thick sackcloth. Like, it tugs and pulls and it feels almost like the scruff of a cat or dog's neck, but it has a clothy texture, and as you grab it, you can feel the cold wisps of shadow and darkness obscure your hands. You feel like you're plunging your arms into it, but you find purchase within that shadow and hold on.
Sam: We'll need to spoon for warmth.
Liam: I nestle in behind Scanlan.
Sam: I gladly accept.
Liam: Let's ride.
Travis: Let's ride?! (laughing)
Matt: All right, so, as you guys take up into the sky, and you guys are taking your short rest, we're going to take a quick break on our end as well. Use the restroom, get a snack.
Marisha: We're taking a break?
Matt: We're taking a break here because it is 8:30. We are going to do another giveaway at the break here, a Wyrmwood giveaway. A fantastic flamebox elder hero vault, which is some of the prettiest wood that they make.
Liam: Maybe the prettiest Wyrmwood box ever.
Laura: How come we didn't ever see those before; is that a new wood?
Matt: I don't know. But it's cool!
Laura: I want it!
Matt: Hero vault for whoever the lucky winner is. To be a part of that drawing, rush over to Twitch chat. Tonight's password is 'secrets,' plural. S-E-C-R-E-T-S. So, when you're prompted, enter the word 'secrets' in Twitch chat to be part of this giveaway and we'll come back and announce who it is after the break. We'll see you guys here in a few minutes. [break] (laughter)
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role.
Ashley: My timing is bad. (laughter)
Matt: We missed you, too, guys.
Travis: Oh my god.
Ashley: I forget, and then I remember to do it, and then we're already on the air.
Matt: Indeed, we are. Welcome back, everybody. First off, our winner of the hero case from our friends at Wyrmwood is Rory1177. Rory1177, you are the winner for tonight. Congratulations. Denobo will contact you and get your information and have that shipped off to you asap, so congratulations. All right, so as the rest of you are taking a short rest, the two of you are making your way, as stealthily as you can, on the back of a gloom stalker as it encircles the exterior of the Castle Entropis. First off, I would like you both to make a stealth check.
Liam: I squeeze the gnome tighter.
Laura: Oh god. I think you're out of range, so you don't get the plus ten anymore.
Liam: That's okayish.
Sam: 21.
Taliesin: You have advantage, though, on everything.
Sam: He's fine.
Liam: 34. A low 34.
Matt: Okay, so you guys begin to circle the exterior of the tower, making a wide spiral along its exterior. You make your way up. It's hard to gauge the full height of this tower, but it's at least six or seven stories tall, if not taller. I want you both to make perception checks, please.
Liam: Now that we're closer, I'm looking for windows that she might not have been close enough to see. Doors, holes, anything.
Matt: Perception check.
Liam: Yes, sir.
Sam: Natural one! I'm under his body.
Matt: He's curled up within Vax.
Liam: Hey!
Matt: Not even a top or bottom circumstance. You're just within.
Liam: It really just depends on the day. 26.
Matt: 26. Okay. No windows. It is a solid tower, completely around as you cycle around. As you get towards the top of it, you notice the three curved fingerlike spires that curl up at the top and the pulsing of the energy. You watch as these very faint tendrils of magical energy that you've tuned in to be able to see better, now that you know what to look for, are all-- from this height, you can see the long strands are undulating and shifting, almost like the very winds of the land are causing them to rotate. You can see the variations in their form, but they're all still merging and entwining at the very top of Entropis. You see nothing. You can see what appear to be a cluster of about 30 or so figures all gathered along the top of this. You can see what appear to be three glowing spheres in a triangular pattern around this that are accepting the tether of the magical energy, and then suffusing what appears to be a small altar of some kind in the very center of the top of this tower.
Liam: Mother bitch.
Matt: You've been circling here for about 15 to 20 minutes or so, and the energy (explosion noise) untethers and unfurls. There's a shockwave of warmth that cascades outward from the top of the tower. Both of you feel it pass through you, and that freezing cold that you've been trying desperately to hold at bay as you're clutching onto the back of this gloom stalker, this heat wave moves past. The gloom stalker (squawks) instinctually pulls back, and you can see for a second it drops, and you feel your stomach bottom out as it loses about 20 feet of elevation before catching itself again. And you watch as any of the others that are currently cycling around the stratosphere over the city of Thar Amphala also are taken off guard by the sudden burst of energy. As you glance over, you can see the tethers that connect have all fallen and faded. (music changes)
Sam: (quietly) How does he do that? How did you do that?
Matt: You also watch as about 25 or so of these figures at the top all collapse at once.
Liam: But some are left.
Matt: There are some left. You watch and very faintly, you can see on that altar in the center, there is a small bead of pure, vibrant, bright white light. You watch as a robed figure that previously was held in the shadows emerge. You're too far away to make any more details than that.
Liam: A lot of motherfuckers just died on the top of that tower. You felt that?
Sam: What do we do? Is that the end of the ritual?
Liam: How much time left on that hour, buddy?
Sam: Enough to get back to our friends, probably.
Liam: We've got to go.
Sam: Should we attack now? Just the two of us?
Liam: No, we should not do that.
Sam: We could.
Liam: We could.
Sam: Between you and me, we're the most powerful ones in the group.
Liam: I just don't feel like freeballing it right now, and I'd really like the group.
Sam: I know, but will you at least confirm that yes, we are the most powerful?
Liam: Clearly. We are the most, as the kids say, OP. Let's get back to the group.
Sam: All right. Hold me tight. Mr. Mistoffeles, back down.
Matt: It goes into a rapid dive, making its way back towards where you left the rest of your party. The rest of you, you can go ahead and regain your short rest. You get your Wild Shape back. You can spend any hit dice to heal up if you'd like. If you haven't already.
Laura: I already did it.
Matt: Okay, good. I also need all of you to roll a wisdom saving throw, please.
Sam: Everybody?
Matt: Everybody who was on a short rest.
Laura: If we had had a Feast, we'd have advantage on this.
Marisha: We would.
Matt: All right, so.
Taliesin: 14.
Marisha: 30.
Laura: 24.
Ashley: Just to make sure  I used Gnome Cunning, because I get advantage on wisdom.
Matt: It's not a "magical" effect.
Ashley: Okay. So then I'll take my first roll, which was two. And then I will add my wisdom saving throw number, which is ten, so I have 12.
Travis: 19.
Sam: I want you to explain every roll.
Matt: In the rest you take, the Shadowfell does not seem to have any adverse effect on your presence.
Taliesin: However...
Matt: There's no "however." You complete your rest fine. You guys all gather your stuff, you take a breath and prepare for the next leg of your venture as the door to your building slams open, Scanlan and Vax arriving, just leaping off the back of the gloom stalker that they had under their control. Who is also about to lose its...
Taliesin: How much longer do they have?
Sam: Fly away!
Taliesin: Attack the tower. Tell it to attack the tower.
Sam: Really? It's going to forget halfway there.
Taliesin: Maybe we can mess one person up.
Sam: Fly away! Just fly away!
Ashley: On the rest, could I have worked a little bit more on enchanting the silver bullets?
Matt: You can spend a little more time on it. It'll take a few days of getting that to happen.
Ashley: I just keep working on it.
Laura: Did we feel that (whoosh) within the building?
Matt: You didn't. You may have heard something strange, but it didn't really catch your attention. You guys spent your time resting on the inside of the building.
Laura: What'd you see?
Liam: Saw a lot of fucking people just die on the top of that tower. I can't guarantee it, but I think it's a safe bet that your girl Delilah is up there.
Laura: That's where I figured she'd be.
Sam: It seems they've completed at least some part of the ritual.
Liam: Yeah, there was some sort of massive pulse of energy, 20-something hooded figures just dropped dead on the spot. A wave of some shit blasted through us.
Laura: Can I run out and look at the tower and see if the orb looks different?
Marisha: I join Vex.
Matt: You guys rush out and peek outside of the doorway towards the top of Entropis. You see that the glowing pulse is gone. The energy tethers from the siphons are gone.
Laura: Fuck.
Marisha: I look around. Are we still in the Shadowfell?
Matt: Perception check.
Marisha: That's not great. 18.
Matt: That's enough. Yeah, you're still in the Shadowfell. (sounds of relief)
Travis: Motherfucking Mercer. That intonation.
Taliesin: If you rolled low enough, he'd be like, "You don't know." Seattle! You've taken us to Seattle!
Laura: Well, we should fucking get up there, then, huh?
Sam: Should we go straight up the tower?
Liam: What else are we doing here?
Sam: Yeah, all right.
Taliesin: Let's head to the base.
Sam: But we're going to fight an aerial battle against super-magical things.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Liam: We're weighing risk here. What do we think would happen if we spent an hour having that Feast right now?
Travis: Actually, that's true. Nothing's going to change at this point.
Sam: Maybe.
Marisha: I mean, maybe we should return to something like sabotaging the machine, or... burning the city. Oh god, Vex is rubbing off on me.
Laura: Did you see Delilah up there?
Liam: No. There was a ringleader, but we were too far out.
Laura: And the ringleader was still standing?
Liam: Yeah.
Ashley: How many people were still standing?
Matt: That would have been three that you noticed.
Liam: Precisely three. (laughter)
Ashley: Lots of them died in the blast?
Sam: Yeah, so it's not even going to be a tough fight. We'll just take down three people and be done, right?
Laura: So easy.
Taliesin: The less people we're fighting, the worse it is.
Marisha: Agreed.
Ashley: It won't just be three.
Taliesin: It might be four.
Sam: It'll be... less than three?
Laura: Even one with that fucking wall she had last time, we're fucked.
Marisha: How far did the blast go that you saw?
Liam: We were 100 yards out or something?
Matt: Yeah, you were probably about 300 feet out.
Laura: We didn't do any research on that wall, did we? That spell? Did anybody do any research on that spell that we saw her do? Down in the ziggurat?
Taliesin: We kind of figured out what it was. It was a modified version of a spell we've seen before.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. It seemed to be prismatic. You've seen Prismatic Spray. It's a prismatic spell in nature but you didn't really research any means of defeating it or bypassing it.
Travis: Do you still have that Earthquake spell?
Marisha: I believe me and Pike both do, yes.
Travis: We couldn't, like, earthquake the tower to the ground. Could we?
Marisha: Between me, you, and Pike? We can take this tower down.
Sam: Is that true?
Travis: I just don't know about us going to the top, if we could maybe bring it--
Taliesin: Oh, if we could maybe bring the top down here?
Sam: That's a good idea, if you can really do it.
Travis: I just don't know how big around it is. It might be fucking huge.
Taliesin: How big around is the tower?
Matt: At the very base--
Taliesin: He's looking at the tower.
Matt: -- it's about 170, 180 feet in diameter.
Marisha: Hang on, 180 feet in diameter? Hang on. Pike and I check our spellbooks real quick.
Taliesin: Can I do a little engineering? If I were going to punch at it...
Liam: Also, the idea that we're going to sneak into that tower is farfetched.
Sam: No, we either have to fly up to the top or bring it down to us, right?
Laura: I like the idea of bringing it down.
Liam: Even if it fails, the fight will still come to-- Either we bring the fight to them, or we rip down the tower and bring the fight to us.
Marisha: For up to a minute and a hundred foot radius, centered at a point...
Matt: It deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell. If it drops to zero hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. So the question is, do you think that'll be enough to drop a solid obsidian tower?
Laura: It's a tough call. Twice in a row?
Marisha: But, I mean, two Earthquake spells and Grog.
Laura: I have a siege arrow.
Marisha: I will point out this will be burning mine and Pike's 8th-level spell, but it might be worth it.
Sam: It feels like it's a 3.2 earthquake, we need a 6.2 earthquake.
Travis: That's true, we do. Let's be honest. We really do need a massive shake.
Laura: What if we weaken the outside and then hit with the earthquake?
Marisha: I can tunnel out underneath it.
Taliesin: I think whatever was going on up there is gone. I think it's happened.
Laura: Well, Delilah's still up there, so if she falls at least she takes some damage.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Liam: I'm just going to throw my vote in the ring here, that I think we should take the time for the Feast. You know, we're not killing piles of rats in the sewers, here. This is serious.
Sam: When last time we fought Delilah, were any of us scared of her?
Taliesin: She's not what I'm afraid of.
Laura: Wisdom saving throws are major. She could take control of us.
Travis: I'm not against that, but I think one person should stay out of the Feast and keep an eye in case they leave in the hour that we're feasting.
Sam: Well, if someone's going to stay out of the Feast, it should be the guy who already has advantage on everything.
Travis: Oh, that too, yeah. I just can't get afraid, that's all I was going to say.
Laura: Yeah, but you can be taken control of with your brain, Grog.
Travis: That's assuming a lot.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Ashley: Shit.
Travis: Or we just go get it. We just go after it and go get it.
Sam: I'm against the Feast. I think we should just run in.
Laura: I just don't feel like there's time, honestly.
Sam: Also, I'm vegan, I don't know if I could eat everything at the feast.
Liam: It is largely GoFiBePo?
Sam: GoFiBePo? Why didn't you just name it a Poobah Platter?
Laura: Oh, that would have been way easier.
Marisha: How far are we from the tower in this little house?
Matt: In this house, you're a little over a half mile away from it.
Taliesin: It's a ten-minute walk.
Matt: So this house is just outside of the perimeter wall of the inner cloister.
Marisha: You guys could do the Feast and some of us can help tunnel out the ground during that hour.
Taliesin: I don't know. I don't think we're going to bring it down.
Travis: I don't know if we're going to bring it down. It was a cool idea, but I don't know if we're going to do it. We're no white ancient dragon.
Ashley: What's it made of? Obsidian?
Matt: You haven't been close enough to really tell, but it looks to be made of a very thick, dark obsidian or onyx-like material.
Liam: It's also unsettling as fuck, right?
Laura: Oh, it's probably magically protected.
Liam: Probably.
Taliesin: It may just hover there if we knock this.
Laura: That is very true.
Taliesin: It may be keeping the ground up as opposed to being sitting on the ground at that point.
Marisha: So we're going to try to fly up?
Taliesin: Or walk up through the inside.
Travis: Raise your hand if you want a Heroes' Feast.
Liam: For you all, yes.
Travis: Four?
Sam: Is that a raise or not?
Travis: Are you scratching your ear or are you raising your hand?
Taliesin: Yes, damn it.
Sam: Wait, so, are we four?
Ashley: I'm just nervous. I know we don't have time, but what if this is one of those decisions where later we're like "We should have fucking done a Heroes' Feast"?
Travis: Well, let's do it.
Ashley: I don't know, though, I don't know if we have the time. This is hard.
Travis: Well, the transaction upstairs has already happened, whether they get away or not.
Marisha: I have a feeling we're going to be down here a while.
Laura: Maybe we can prepare the Feast, keep an eye out. If we have to ditch out on the Feast early, then we do.
Marisha: Keyleth looks out the window again. Are people panicked, are people running around? Is there a rabble in the street?
Matt: There's no technical window in this building. There's the door.
Travis: She just pushes her head against the wall.
Matt: So you look out the door and glance through. You do notice, there's no panic, but you do see a number of-- and this is interesting-- you glance out, and you don't see any undead wandering the streets of the inner cloister. At least, not like the outer area was. You do see-- make a perception check, actually.
Marisha: Oh, that's good! 30!
Matt: You see, throughout the street, which, the street from here gets about halfway to the tower before it hits a building and curves around. You see maybe 35 or 40 total people in matching or close cultist robes or similar colors, all making their way towards the tower.
Taliesin: They're dressed for an occasion. Fuck it. Just go.
Laura: We got to go. 35 to 40 people? Let's kill 'em all on the way up.
Marisha: Man, you're frosty today. You're just--
Laura: They're trying to come over into our territory. I don't like it. They're all assholes.
Travis: Shall we go in?
Marisha: Well, how are we going to go in, though? Just flying up?
Taliesin: We have one broom, we don't have two brooms anymore. We got a carpet, and we got wings.
Laura: And a couple people with wings. Oh god, the creepy music is starting. We gotta go, y'all.
Liam: Beeline to the tower.
Marisha: And then what? And then what, though? Once we get there? Play it by ear?
Taliesin: Throw everything off the top. Break everything. Smash everything.
Laura: It's Delilah. She's going to destroy us. Do we have any way to neutralize her magic?
Travis: Well, you could turn into a... no.
Marisha: I can't. I gave Vax Foresight. I cannot turn into a beholder today.
Sam: I can.
Taliesin: You can?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: Do you have Shapechange?
Sam: Something like it. (gasping)
Taliesin: All right, this is almost a plan. Let's do this.
Travis: It's more than we normally have.
Taliesin: It's far more.
Laura: Are there a lot of gloom stalkers around?
Matt: You can tell with the loss of magical energy that they've been tossed askew a bit. Their patterns of circling and being intent, they're a little more scattered a bit, but there are still maybe a few dozen that look over the inner cloister.
Taliesin: Let's make our way to the tower and maybe head up through the tower. We don't have to necessarily fly up to the top.
Laura: Wait a minute. Did the orb at the top turn the same way that the orbs in the ziggurat turn?
Matt: There were faint orbs that were taking the energy and focusing it towards that center altar, and when everything faded after the shock wave, what you saw looked like the tiniest star. It was just a speck of extremely bright light that to look directly at it hurt.
Travis: I don't know! I don't! Just go get it.
Marisha: I'm honestly still kind of into the earthquake idea. Bringing down the tower. I'm not going to lie.
Sam: That's not going to work!
Marisha: How do you know?
Sam: You said 50 points of damage?
Taliesin: I can take 50 points of damage. I can take two earthquakes, personally.
Sam: I mean, just from a metagaming scenario, that's not even-- that can't even hurt--
Marisha: No, no, no. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in your area when you cast the spell, and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, and the spell lasts a minute.
Sam: So you get ten 50s.
Marisha: Ten of those. Ten 50s.
Laura: Oh, and then times two.
Marisha: With Pike and I.
Sam: So that's 1000 points. Over a minute. That's better than I thought.
Liam: Is it concentration?
Marisha: It's concentration for up to a minute, and it has a 500-foot range, and a 100-foot radius. So Pike and I could split, half and half of the tower.
Travis: It's pretty fucking Hollywood. I kind of like it.
Taliesin: All right! All right, let's do it.
Marisha: I feel like if we go right up to the top of the tower, it's like walking into the danger.
Taliesin: Let's bring the tower down to us.
Marisha: This is insane!
Liam: And you can still fuck shit up while you got that earthquake going, right?
Marisha: Well, how do you mean?
Laura: Oh, yeah, if you have that spell going, you can do other things in case things attack us?
Liam: Are you just doing Earthquake the whole time, or are you just standing there staring at the ground?
Marisha: It's my concentration, so I can keep it going and do an instant reaction spell.
Matt: Do other things, you can't do another concentration spell.
Liam: But you're not lightning anybody's ass, not doing anything like that. You're focusing on the tower.
Marisha: I mean, I can throw a Fireball and keep it going, yeah.
Liam: That's really big. All right.
Taliesin: I say the movers and shakers get the cloaks. Let's head out.
Laura: Get up as close as we can to support Pike and Keyleth.
Taliesin: And we keep them safe. We are playing defense.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: God, I hope this works.
Taliesin: God, I hope this works, too.
Marisha: I don't know if this is going to work!
Laura: This is stupid as fuck!
Taliesin: We're distance. Anybody gets near them, we take them out.
Marisha: Grog, can you at the right moment just do a big-- see if you can topple it over?
Travis: I can try and do whatever you want. I can run around and punch a bunch of holes in it, whatever.
Taliesin: We're going to focus everything on one side of the tower, we're going to try and bring it down in a direction. Here we go.
Laura: Yes, focus it on one side of the tower. Both on the same side.
Taliesin: Like a tree. Let's do this. This is a terrible plan. All right. LAURA Just trying to gauge Matt.
Marisha: I know! Matt's stone cold!
Taliesin: Matt's thinking about all the other people he could be playing D&D with right now. (laughing)
Taliesin: He's imagining a whole other set of faces here.
Liam: All right, let's teleport inside that dragon. Come on.
Matt: Yeah, what's the plan, guys?
Liam: That's the plan.
Laura: We're going to get close enough so that they can do their 500 feet distance. But keep a distance to the tower.
Marisha: And if we can be hidden while we're doing this, instead of being open. We have a 500-foot range here. We've got a dope-ass range.
Taliesin: Keyleth's got a cloak. Pike's got a cloak.
Travis: I'm huge.
Taliesin: He's huge.
Laura: We're going to try to get in a building that's closer to the tower.
Matt: Okay. Seeming lasts for eight hours, so you're still under the guise of that illusion.
Sam: Although we don't--
Laura: -- need that anymore.
Taliesin: Well, we can look like cultists.
Sam: Keyleth, you said that there's no other undead around here, right? Maybe we shouldn't look like undead, then.
Taliesin: Can you shift what we look like without changing it?
Sam: I don't think I can shift it. No, you can't. That's a one-time thing.
Laura: Maybe just drop it and we'll be cultists.
Marisha: How many robes did we swipe?
Sam: We've got the one from the guy whose head we just crushed.
Matt: You would have four cloaks, because there's two you got from the outside at the ritual, and there's the one from the guy you killed when you got here. Well, technically, there was the two that you killed when you got there, but you didn't say you grabbed those. Oh, you did, you grabbed them off. So that's two, five, six. You have six cloaks.
Laura: Yeah, and then the one, the guy that we just killed in front of the --
Matt: That was included.
Sam: Me and Pike, she could be on my shoulders and we could share one cloak.
Laura: Yeah! That's good!
Travis: I have that Cloak of Smashing that Percy gave me.
Marisha: Totally 'Little Rascals' it! Oh, I love it!
Laura: Yeah, we'll just robe it up.
Matt: You guys all throw on the--
Ashley: I almost feel like it should be the other way around.
Sam: Oh, it absolutely should. (laughter)
Matt: Six cloaks, seven players. You guys are straight-up doing-- I am so proud of everything that has just happened. (laughter)
Sam: To make it look like our arms can reach the ends of the cloak-- are they sleeved cloaks?
Matt: Yes, they are.
Sam: I'm going to hold a flute and my sword. (laughing)
Liam: Mythcarver! You used Mythcarver to pull a Little Rascals!
Matt: "There will be no survivors!"
Taliesin: "The dread Pirate Roberts is here for your souls!"
Liam: Hey guys, it's the third time Scanlan has used Mythcarver! (laughter)
Marisha: That's a vestige right there!
Taliesin: It's gone from exalted to shamed.
Matt: It retracts into a dagger now.
Taliesin: Never happens. This never happens.
Matt: All right. In a hip montage, you pull out the various cloaks, assemble your materials, getting ready.
Taliesin: We are a bunch of assholes.
Matt: Scanlan hops on top of Pike, the cloak is placed over you. You get your sleeves ready, and you all walk out into the cold air of the Shadowfell, making your way towards the center of the city.
Marisha: Be cool. Be cool.
Liam: I'm also going to say, some time in the last several hours, I don't remember what the armor is set to, to necrotic.
Matt: I think you may have said that before you went in, just in case. I assumed that was the case.
Laura: I think that was already there, yeah.
Taliesin: And remember, if anyone looks at you, close one eye. Just be winking. Always be winking. Left eye.
Laura: Does everybody have their arms, that we've run into so far? Or are they missing an arm, too? An eye and an arm or just an eye?
Matt: It varies. Not everyone seems to be missing a hand, but most of them are missing an eye.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: You all look like my sister.
Marisha: You need to get your eyes checked, then. Your depth perception may be off.
Sam: All right, we go!
Matt: All right. You guys make your way up the street, following behind the few stragglers that you see trying to catch up with the rest of the groups of people that have filtered out of the buildings and made their way towards the center. You make your way through some of the side roads, following around, and you can see now that the closer you get to the city, the more the structures, the buildings here, are built in a spiral. The roads don't intersect at spokes, they all gradually curve in to the tower. If you're looking at it overhead, it looks like this large spiral into the tower, like a pinwheel. You follow the curvature of the road, which prevents you from seeing the end point, and as you begin to get close to some of the clusters of people that are walking with a brisk walk, but still walking towards the tower, you fall back a little bit to not draw any attention. As you're making your way there, you watch as two individuals hurry up that were a little bit behind you, and rush up to the side and are walking in pace. They glance over.
Marisha: Hoods forward.
Matt: One of them, who appears to be a younger man, probably 18, 19 or so, who's got this little patch of reddish brown chin fuzz and looks a little malnourished. He still has both eyes. He rushes up real fast, his hood pulling back a little bit, and he's looking around, excited but also with trepidation. "So it's happening, huh? It's really happening!"
Laura: I guess so.
Liam: It's fucking wild.
Laura: So exciting.
Sam: I'm so excited to be here!
Laura: Oh, don't.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Travis: Keep your mouth shut! Just keep your mouth shut!
Marisha: Just nod and smile.
Sam: 24.
Matt: He looks at you and goes, "Oh! I didn't know the Whispered One takes the special ones, too!"
Travis: Yep! Sure does!
Taliesin: What are you going to do after?
Matt: "I don't know."
Taliesin: Surely you've thought.
Matt: "I'm pretty low on the totem pole here. I'm just excited to be on the right side of history."
Laura: Ditto.
Liam: Fuck the normies.
Matt: "All right." And he rushes up past you guys to try and catch up.
Sam: So awkward.
Laura: I think he bought it. I think we played it really cool there, guys.
Marisha: I'm really bad at holding my eye shut for this long.
Taliesin: So are we close enough now that we can start this?
Matt: Not yet. You're about maybe 1,000 feet or so away.
Taliesin: I'm going to see if there's any structures that are within distance so that once they set up and start, I can get to them. Maybe we can perch.
Marisha: We only need to be so far out.
Taliesin: We can cover you from a roof.
Matt: Perception check, Percival.
Liam: Also wondering how we're doing in the gloom stalker department?
Matt: No one's seen you, currently. It seems that whatever piercing vision they have, it does not seem to pierce robes.
Laura: I want to keep an eye out for buildings, too.
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: Okay. Then you as well make a perception check.
Taliesin: Please.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. Okay. You glance about, and there are a lot of buildings here with vantage points. They're all similar heights. There are a few that are outliers, but most of them are one and a half to two stories, like a one story with an attic or an attic space, like a half-story. Or two stories. You do check a few that are third-story, and a lot of them are almost in steeple-like spires at the top. You start to notice there is a theme. A lot of the buildings closer to the tower are built in a similar theme as the tower itself. You begin to see the edges of the roofs curve up into their own spikes, and the further in you go, the more dangerous and unwelcoming the deeper inner cloister of Thar Amphala is to witness. You can see now certain people are climbing onto the roofs. They're getting up there, almost like they're preparing for some sort of a festival or a fireworks show.
Marisha: Like the Fourth of fucking July.
Laura: The aliens are coming and we're welcoming them.
Travis: Well, they're not wrong.
Matt: You notice, Vex... There's been no change in daylight or nightlight here. It's been this constant deep, dark gray gloom that hangs over the Shadowfell, unchanging, unshifting. There's a creeping brightness on the horizon that you feel rising.
Laura: We're getting ready to teleport.
Matt: And you watch as that creeping brightness forms a dome over your space, and then comes to a close over the top of the tower, and where once there was this gloomy skyscape, you now see what appears to be a brighter, clouded sky. The temperature grows a little colder, and you begin to see snowfall. Gentle snow begins to fall, and you watch as some of the cultists surrounding start reaching up and catching it in their hands.
Taliesin: Now, now!
Sam: We've still got to attack.
Marisha: It's totally taken us to Whitestone.
Sam: It's okay, we can still kill everybody.
Matt: Make a nature check.
Laura: We're in the north. There's a lot of places that snow. It could be Draconia. There's a lot of places that snow.
Liam: But it's Delilah Briarwood.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: You have no direct idea of where you are, but based on the weather that you left Whitestone in not too long ago, this isn't Whitestone or near Whitestone. The weather patterns are a little more classic snow.
Laura: Is it winter in Wildemount right now?
Matt: It's the tail end of winter in a few places.
Liam: Tower still needs to come down.
Sam: Let's go. Let's move. Let's attack. Are we within 500 feet?
Matt: You guys are about now within 500 feet.
Laura: Fucking get into the building that we can, and then start it.
Marisha: Pike and I huddle together and try and join forces.
Ashley: Let's do it.
Marisha: Let's do it.
Matt: As you guys are holding hands, a voice begins to ring out. Omnipresent. Directionless, like it's being positioned directly into the minds of each of you from wherever it stands. It's an unfamiliar voice. The words creep and curl in, like they've always been resting, and now is the moment is for them to reveal themselves. "I would ask you to listen before you make a fool of yourselves. I've watched you since you stepped into my domain, and I'm not going to lie, it's been entertaining. I admire your gumption. It reminds me of others who have tried what you are trying. But they're dead now, so I leave the choice to you. You can either walk away, or you can join me, or you will die, and join me anyway."
Laura: Eff that shit. Just do it.
Liam: No one walks away.
Marisha: People don't tell us to stop if they're not afraid of what we're doing.
Taliesin: To the end.
Laura: To the end.
Sam: To the end.
Taliesin: Yeah, let's just pretend that's not really happening.
Laura: Do it.
Marisha: I love you all. We do it, above the screaming, howling Horror Nights sound effects.
Taliesin: I pull Silence.
Matt: All right. As you guys clasp hands, and begin the intricate incantation for the Earthquake spell, you can hear the cheers of people on the rooftops. They're standing up now, and they're all shouting, "Yes! Yes, I hear you!" You get the sense that perhaps you weren't the only ones that have been spoken to, although the conversations may differ from individual to individual. As you guys complete your incantation, you watch as the dust begins to rise around the base. You see Entropis begin to quiver back and forth, and you watch as everyone begins to rush to the edge of the rooftops, then rush into the streets to look up, their hands raised to the sky, not sure what this means, but basking in whatever glory this next sign or omen is to be. You watch as a loud, shattering crack sound hits, and you watch as one large, snaking, carving line begins to work its way up one side of the tower. Up another. And the collective gasp of hundreds of voices across the city seem to echo, (gasps). You watch as one side buckles, and the tower begins to slowly (rumble) to the ground.
Sam: Is it falling towards us?
Matt: It's falling not towards you.
Ashley: We thought of that.
Matt: But not the entire tower.
Taliesin: Fuck.
Matt: You glance up and watch as the very apex, the three-clawed top of the tower, is just there, in the sky, held aloft, unmoving, as the rest of the tower seems to have (rumble) broken away, and as it falls, this slow, terrifying collapse, you hear the rumbling of broken stone slamming into earth as clouds of smoke, dust, and dead earth are kicked up from the impact of this falling tower, completely enswirling the center of the city with debris and darkness. You watch as cultists go running now, their faces filled with fear and confusion at what this suddenly means, what's happening. As the dust washes past you, it gives this haze over the sky, and slowly comes to fade. You all, taking in what's happening, watch as that one apex of the spire slowly makes its way down to the surface of wherever you are on top of the rubble that once stood as Entropis.
Marisha: It kind of worked.
Sam: I mean, it wasn't bad.
Marisha: It brought it down. Did anyone of significance die in the process?
Matt: You can only assume.
Laura: Can we see who it is?
Matt: You're too far away. You're 500 feet away from this.
Sam: Let's go.
Laura: Let's go.
Taliesin: Broom.
Travis: We're going up to it or waiting till it comes down all the way?
Sam: Oh, I mean, it's landing, right?
Matt: It's landed. It settled itself. It's kind of cocked to one side. For it to land in the rubble, it's not a perfect platform, it (rumble) and comes to rest at a very faint angle among the ruined, broken, jagged obsidian pile. It's a thousand million flecked arrowheads all jumbled in this broken glass-like landscape of destroyed tower, and there, the very zenith of this once-grand structure sits resting, waiting.
Taliesin: Let's do this.
Sam: Do we have an escape plan?
Travis: Kill everything.
Marisha: I can Plane Shift us if things get really bad, but I kind of think we're already on our plane.
Laura: This sounds like we're all going to die!
Sam: Sure does.
Ashley: All right, guys, we're going to do this. We're going to do this.
Liam: Start walking.
Taliesin: The minute I grab onto your broom, you can't hear anything, so I'm just going to ride it down to the ground and then let go.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Well, I'm done playing, so I'm going to take the Titan Stone Knuckles and smash them together and cast Enlarge on myself.
Matt: Your cloak tears around your body, Incredible Hulk style as your form ruins what remains of the black, sheared fabric that once, even by the stretch of the imagination, pseudo-hid you, now...
Travis: A bib remains.
Matt: Exactly. It's almost like one of those Chippendale neckpieces. What you see is a number of cultists that were running away from the tower stop and see this, and then, almost instinctually, go to defend. Make an intimidation check.
Travis: Should've raged. That's not terrible. 24.
Matt: And go scattering in other directions. You see some are rushing towards the tower to see what happened, to see if anyone's okay. There are a lot of cultists that were crushed, you imagine, on that side of the city, especially since they were clustering at the base for whatever this was. But many more are still out in the streets as you guys walk (footsteps), making your way towards the central tower.
Laura: I take off the robes. Get ready. Slow motion walk towards the tower.
Matt: You make your way down the ruined city streets of Thar Amphala. Amongst the snowfall that's now beginning to gather on the tops of your heads and your shoulders and your wings, and along the sides of the street that hadn't seen snowfall, probably ever. You make your way past the final boundary buildings, the cultists just letting you pass, looks of fear, looks of excitement, looks of knowing, looks of understanding that you probably walk to your deaths and I want to watch this happen. You begin to step over the rubble, your footfalls finding the grinding, high-pitched cracks of broken glass-like obsidian beneath your feet. There you look up, and can see about 25 or 30 feet of the tower top is resting at an angle. You can't see what's up on top of it. No windows. How do you wish to proceed?
Liam: We're not sneaking up on shit.
Laura: Well, no. They know we're here.
Travis: Circle? Flank? All together? Which one?
Taliesin: Powerhouses together. Distance fighters keep their distance. I'll take the carpet if it's available.
Laura: Surround the tower, climb up each side?
Travis: I would.
Taliesin: I'm going to grab the carpet. Anybody who wants a lift up, feel free.
Travis: I will take that ride.
Laura: I'll broom it.
Ashley: I'll hop up on the carpet.
Taliesin: Carpet's full.
Matt: As you guys are getting yourselves prepared, that voice returns to you, echoing through your minds once again. "I am genuinely impressed. I'm excited. And I would like for you to remain to watch my ascension, but far be it for me to rob anyone of a fine death, so come. Come, and be the next sacrifice for the new age."
Laura: You're a dipshit!
Travis: Eloquence personified.
Matt: So, via broom...
Sam: We have to fly to get up to it?
Laura: It's 35 feet up, so.
Marisha: To the top of the tower?
Travis: Platform, whatever you want to call it.
Liam: I'm going to shoot up and past by quite a bit.
Marisha: Can I hop on a carpet or broom?
Laura: You can hop on my broom.
Taliesin: I was about to say, carpet's a bit full.
Marisha: I'll hop on the broom with Vex.
Sam: I need a ride as well.
Taliesin: Once I'm up, I'm going to scatter.
Sam: Do you want me to be a beholder? Or a dragon?
Marisha: Beholder has the anti-magic cone eye situation. Just wait and see.
Sam: Wait and see? Figured I should do it now.
Taliesin: How long can you maintain a beholder?
Marisha: How long does it last to cast?
Sam: It's instantaneous.
Taliesin: Oh, then wait until the moment that it's necessary.
Sam: But he could Counterspell it unless I do it now.
Laura: I don't know if he's actually here yet.
Matt: Help me put this down right... There.
Ashley: That's awesome.
Laura: I feel like whenever we come across a map, I feel like we walked into his hand, exactly where he wanted us.
Travis: Let's also talk about the fact that it's been years since we've been this close to a map.
Matt: This is also true.
Taliesin: That is true.
Matt: Please. Indulge me where you're coming in from. And these resemble the three curved spires.
Travis: Those ideally go like that above it, right?
Matt: Yeah, they curve upward and stop about there.
Taliesin: So they're not platform-y.
Matt: No. They come to a point.
Taliesin: I'm hiding behind this glowing spire. I'm going to take some cover behind.
Matt: You rush. We're looking for landing placement, here. This'll come into play, here. Grog, where are you going?
Travis: I'll go right there.
Matt: Right there.
Laura: Me and Keyleth-- do you want to land over here?
Marisha: That's fine. Yeah, I follow your lead.
Laura: As soon as I land, I bamf Trinket out.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: I'm going to say that I'm about 80 feet in the air, just off-center. Towards Vex and Keyleth, but just off-center.
Laura: Keep a distance, don't be in a line with us.
Liam: I'm going to say I'm there, straight up.
Matt: There you are, Vax, right there.
Travis: The minis look so cool!
Taliesin: I haven't seen them in so long.
Travis: I know, we've been so far away!
Taliesin: Who's left? Pike?
Matt: Pike and Scanlan. Because you took the carpet, you're going to have to be near Grog for where you guys land. Going to be the circumstance there. Percy, you just run up the side to get there?
Taliesin: No, I was on the carpet and hopped and left them because they had to go pick up.
Matt: If that's the case, then I'll say that you're landing.
Taliesin: No, they had to go get Scanlan--
Matt: Oh, you had to go get Scanlan?
Taliesin: It's 35 feet.
Matt: If you guys had leave Scanlan behind, that's a whole different thing.
Sam: No, I think I'm going to just go ahead and be a beholder and fly in there myself.
Taliesin: Okay, that'll work.
Matt: Okay!
Travis: Wow! Okay! All right! YOLO, why the fuck not?
Taliesin: If you'd be so kind, throw me here, then.
Liam: Someday, we could have a game with two beholders on our side.
Marisha: It's true! But not today.
Matt: That's Scanlan. (laughter)
Taliesin: I like that you found a goofy-looking beholder. (goofy voice) Hi!
Ashley: Hey, you guys!
Marisha: Hey, you guys!
Matt: As you guys arrive, the floor is just surrounded in bodies. Cultists of very ornate robes. Mostly you've seen peon-based: black splatters of sackcloth, what was available.
Laura: They've been peed on?!
Matt: No. these are well-adorned and appear to have been very well-regarded within the Remnants. You also see, on this side, what appears to be-- sorry, on this side would be Delilah Briarwood.
Laura: Bitchface Briarwood.
Marisha: Bitchface Briarwood!
Matt: On this side, you see what appears to be a black, armored, massive, not quite goliath-sized, but a thick, dark black knight of jagged dark metal armor, what appears to be a longsword that emanates this dark energy, and floating above--
Taliesin: Oh, balls.
Laura: Oh no, what's flying?
Ashley: Put it away.
Laura: No, I don't need it!
Liam: Those are my platforms, I can take them back anytime I want!
Laura: Oh no! What is that?
Matt: You see a man, though the flesh is pulled tight against a skeletal frame. You see long, red and purple and black robes that are tattered and drift below the breeze and cold gently blowing by. You see a field of crackling energy just bursting around the outskirts of his form. You see one hand is out, in a welcoming position, while the empty wrist that once contained a hand is now open on the other side. You see the bald, hairless head, which is covered in spots and tugged open, bits of flesh that have curled away from rotten decay. You see the cheeks sunken in where the skeletal teeth are now emblazoned in a terrible grin. You see the right eye, and the gaping hole where a bright green, bursting, flaming vacuous void where an eye once was now drifts off a trail behind it. You see there, reborn before you, the Whispered One, the Undying King. Vecna himself.
Travis: Oh god, we're in it!
Taliesin: I don't like it being this close.
Sam: We'll probably all die.
Matt: I would like you all to roll initiative. (screaming)
Travis: No!
Sam: Matthew Mercer, may I borrow your Monster Manual so I know what I am?
Matt: Marisha actually has a page for it, if you want that.
Marisha: I do have a page. Do you want my beholder page?
Sam: Yeah!
Taliesin: That's terrible.
Marisha: That's terrible for me, too.
Laura: My teeth hurt.
Matt: My teeth hurt?!
Taliesin: That's terrible. I'm not okay with that roll.
Marisha: Oh, give me that back page. Sorry.
Taliesin: Back page.
Sam: It doesn't say what his initiative is.
Taliesin: You have to roll. It's a dex modifier plus a d20 if you don't have initiative?
Matt: What's that?
Taliesin: Your initiative is normal.
Matt: Your initiative is whatever the creature's initiative is, which is its dex modifier.
Sam: Okay. All right.
Taliesin: Plus a d20.
Sam: 11.
Liam: When was the last time we went to bed?
Laura: I mean, it's a normal amount of time.
Liam: No, I mean, like, right before coming? I can't remember the last time we had a full rest.
Matt: A full rest would have been maybe four or five hours ago.
Liam: Okay. I think I have all my Lucks. That's why I'm asking.
Taliesin: I don't think you've burned since we've come through.
Liam: Not 100% sure.
Marisha: I also gave you advantage on everything.
Liam: I know it! Girl!
Marisha: I think you didn't use anything.
Matt: Initiative order. 25 to 20?
Travis: 20. Shit.
Matt: Fuck, guys. Guys.
Travis: Me?! Okay.
Laura: I have no plan!
Ashley: We're fully Leeroy Jenkins-ing.
Laura: Fully. Leeroy Jenkins!
Matt: Grog, what's your dex?
Travis: My dexterity? 15.
Matt: Okay. Technically, you rolled the same initiative as the death knight, so he'll go right after you.
Travis: Okay. The death knight, by the way, is what Colonel Arnold Fuck is.
Matt: 20 to 15.
Liam: 16.
Laura: 18.
Ashley: 17.
Laura: Ooh, nice!
Matt: You had 18, 17.
Liam: 16. Sylas, broomstick-up-his-ass, death knight Briarwood.
Sam: 11.
Taliesin: 13.
Laura: This first round is definitely a surprise attack on them, right?
Matt: Oh yeah! Totally!
Marisha: Seven.
Taliesin: They did not see this shit coming. At all.
Matt: All righty. So.
Marisha: I had so much hope when we took down their tower. It went away very quickly.
Taliesin: It did, but I think that probably made a lot of cultists go away.
Liam: Guys, we've got to start the new campaign sometime.
Matt: Okay. Beginning of the round.
Marisha: We all die.
Taliesin: I cast Game Over. 20th-level spell.
Matt: So many options. (groaning)
Taliesin: Fuck you.
Liam: We're going to die. Yep!
Travis: Obviously, we're not at the top of the round.
Matt: Okay, so. Vecna, as he stands there, seeing the beholder arrive over the edge, seeing the paladin in the sky, seeing the rest of these individuals cluster in, goes, "Very well. I wanted to talk more. Please, sit." I need Scanlan, Vax, Grog, Keyleth, and Vex to all make wisdom saving throws, please.
Travis: Fuck!
Marisha: Ugh, should have done that fucking Feast!
Laura: We knew we were going to say it.
Sam: Shit, I'm gonna lose my fucking 9th-level spell.
Ashley: Not necessarily!
Marisha: 13.
Travis: Oh fuck, yeah. A natural 19.
Laura: I have a feeling I have to roll really high against fucking Vecna!
Taliesin: Do you have a Luck?
Laura: Oh yeah, Tary had Luck, not Scanlan.
Sam: Neither have Luck. I'm a beholder.
Taliesin: No, you have all of your other stuff.
Sam: Are you sure about that?
Marisha: Is it like Shapechange?
Sam: This is True Polymorph. I am this creature.
Marisha: Oh, it's True Polymorph.
Matt: He is that creature.
Liam: That's hot.
Sam: Except it's not, because I'm about to not be anymore.
Laura: Because he's going to cancel it.
Matt: So.
Sam: 18.
Liam: God damn it.
Travis: Oh, Jesus.
Marisha: 27.
Matt: You resist.
Liam: 18.
Laura: Oh god, you have to roll so high in order to resist.
Sam: Even with advantage? Oh, fuck.
Travis: 19.
Marisha: They roll disadvantage against you, too.
Taliesin: Oh, you didn't say me.
Laura: You skipped me. And I rolled a 20.
Marisha: You rolled a 20?
Matt: You feel the force of his magical prowess coalesce like a cold vise on your brain, and your body seizes, holding taut. And you're all held. You fall straight down 80 feet.
Marisha: Oh, no.
Travis: (nervous laughter) Oh, fuck! Oh man!
Marisha: None of us can do anything to help him?
Laura: We slow-motion walked into our own death.
Travis: Oh, shit!
Sam: Is Pike out?
Matt: Take 32 points of bludgeoning damage, Vax. And you are-- Oh god!
Laura: Walls brought down.
Matt: Prone, there.
Marisha: Fucking shit.
Matt: The rest of you are also held.
Travis: Is this charmed or frightened?
Matt: No.
Travis: Okay, it's not.
Laura: What does being held mean?
Liam: It's paralysis.
Taliesin: Until we save, or until his concentration is broken, I assume.
Matt: Correct.
Travis: And rage would have no effect on this?
Matt: Nope!
Travis: Fucking shit.
Matt: And he's going to go ahead and shift up about 20 more feet and kind of glance over the battlefield a bit.
Sam: He's a god! He's a golden god!
Travis: He actually is one. And he won't jump off a 1000-foot cliff.
Matt: (chuckles) Apparently. All right.
Laura: T minus ten minutes until he turns into a goldfish.
Marisha: We can only be so hopeful.
Laura: That's plenty of time for us to die.
Matt: That ends his turn. Delilah's now going to go.
Travis: Oh, good!
Laura: Oh, good!
Travis: Wow, what a way to lead off the round!
Sam: My anti-magic cone is not in effect, I assume?
Taliesin: Actually, isn't it just naturally wherever they're looking?
Matt: It's wherever you're facing, but he hasn't had a turn to go yet, he basically just arrived.
Taliesin: Oh, okay.
Matt: So it would be kind of in this path here, wherever you would have come in in this regard. So it would be this direction.
Liam: It's a big fuckin' headlamp.
Sam: (laughs) Just frozen there. I really want to swallow and I can't close--
Taliesin: I was under the impression that the eyeball was passive.
Matt: I'm checking right now, actually.
Sam: Well, you have to choose. At the start of each turn--
Matt: At the start of its turn, which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.
Sam: I haven't had a turn.
Marisha: And if it's active?
Taliesin: You're holding your action for being able to move.
Matt: Anyway.
Travis: Hey, so... (laughs)
Sam: We got this, guys. How many of us are still able to move?
Matt: Three of you.
Sam: Hey! Okay!
Travis: Looking up! Things are looking up. He has 12 hit points, by the way.
Marisha: Being held. What's the deal with that?
Matt: You're paralyzed. Which means you are incapacitated, you automatically fail strength and dexterity saving throws, attack rolls against you have advantage, and any creature that hits you within five feet, it's a critical hit.
Travis: Basically worst scenario possible. That's all you had to say: worst scenario possible.
Taliesin: It could be worse, but it would take math. This is bad.
Sam: Pike's going to solve everything.
Ashley: Oh, yeah.
Sam: Yeah, she can get us out of this.
Liam: Flipping those pages.
Travis: Remember this look, boys and girls. On Matt's face. As the chef carefully picks the menu of our-- Yes.
Laura: Of our destruction? Of our doom?
Taliesin: He has been grooming us and fattening us up for two years.
Matt: Delilah is going to move.
Sam: Oh no, lair action, she explodes. (laughter)
Matt: And is going to step over Vax's body on the ground.
Marisha: Oh, bitch! You better back off, bitch!
Laura: Hope you're wearing underwear, bitch, because he just looked up your skirt!
Matt: And looks at you.
Laura: (small voice) Me?
Matt: It's been a while, my dear. (yelling)
Laura: No! Why would you do this?! How you do dis Matt?!
Matt: Yep, so make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: No!
Matt: You're held, but you still make a constitution roll.
Marisha: Come on...
Ashley: Matt, how do you do this?!
Travis: Come on.
Marisha: Not again.
Laura: Natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: No way!
Liam: And I said, biiiiitch.
Matt: So you take half as much damage, which is good.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Laura: Oh, I'm really glad we healed.
Liam: Vax on the ground just starts going (unintelligible yells).
Matt: All right, so instead of 61 points of necrotic damage, you take 30 points of necrotic damage.
Liam: I'm shaking, guys.
Taliesin: Leroy!
Travis: Oh my god.
Liam: Got to squeeze my spiky dice to wake up.
Laura: Ow, ow.
Matt: You okay?
Laura: (whimpering) I'm good.
Travis: Blood pressure's a thing right now.
Matt: That'll end her turn. Grog.
Liam: Holy shit, Grog.
Matt: Your turn happens at the same time the lair action happens.
Travis: And the Death Knight, right?
Matt: And the Death Knight. He's going to go directly after you. You guys going on the same turn, I gave you a little bit.
Taliesin: Oh man, I am not-- This does not feel good.
Travis: Oh, shit! Oh!
Matt: You watch as the bodies on the ground quiver (sound of bones cracking) And begin to rise up around you.
Sam: No, forget them! Fix us! Forget them, they're nothing. Fix us.
Laura: They could just attack us until we die.
Sam: Fix. Us. They're tiny.
Taliesin: I have a plan. I have a plan.
Sam: Fix us.
Travis: What, you're going to pledge your fealty to the fucking--
Sam: Some sort of-- I don't know, can you restore... Restoration?
Laura: Do you have mass Restoration?
Ashley: No!
Marisha: That's not a spell, you guys!
Ashley: I'm useless!
Marisha: I don't know if Pike can fix this!
Laura: I don't think she can fix it.
Ashley: Let's use it! Let's just make it, Matt, you can put that in your new campaign book. Mass Restoration.
Laura: Mass Anti-hold.
Matt: And this will be there. So they all rise up out of the ground, these basic skeletons, and they all get one attack. So against Percy, this one moves in. Rolls a natural one, misses entirely. One of them's going to strike at the beholder that's up in the air; that's going to be a 15, what's your armor class?
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18. Just ricochets off the armor. There's one here that's going to go toward Pike. And you're not held, right? You resisted it. So it's going to go ahead and make a strike on you; that's another 15. Just hits your armor and scrapes off, no effect. This one's going to rush forward, two against Vax on the ground. It has advantage. That's a 19.
Liam: To do what?
Matt: To attack you.
Liam: All right, so I'm at disadvantage, but I have advantage, so it would be one straight roll?
Matt: No, it has advantage against you because you're paralyzed, so yeah, it would be one straight roll. The first roll was 19.
Liam: Oh, so no.
Matt: No. Your armor class is 21 naturally?
Liam: It is 21 when the daggers are out, and my daggers are in my hands. I mean, I don't know, this is kinda loosey-goosey. All right, then I'm at 20.
Matt: Yeah, so it still misses you. The other one, no, misses. Both of them just miss you. The effect of the 9th-level spell is just enough of a vibration that the attacks are being-- You're moving just, (grunts) ever so faintly out of the way.
Liam: Familiar.
Matt: One attacking Keyleth. That is a 24.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So you suffer eight points of slashing damage. And then Vex, that is a 12 to hit? And a 20 to hit. Neither hit? So as they're striking you, they're hitting the armor, it's just not cutting through. They can't seem to get through it. So that worked out okay in your favor.
Laura: Thanks, dragon armor!
Matt: Grog? You're paralyzed.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Matt: I believe you make another saving throw at the end of your turn to try and shrug off the effect.
Travis: Can I go into a paralyzed rage?
Matt: Nope. But make a wisdom saving throw.
Laura: God, we've got to roll like a 27 in order to break it!
Travis: 12.
Matt: Nope. You're still locked in place, unable to move.
Sam: I will never be able to break it.
Laura: A 20 didn't break it, so yeah.
Sam: Yeah, there's no way.
Matt: A natural 20 would break it.
Laura: A natural 20.
Marisha: A natural 20 would break it, that's the only thing?
Travis: I have a modifier of zero, so.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Gotta fucking attack that bitch.
Travis: Holy shit.
Matt: Actually, you know what? No. He's gonna stay back there and move this way to get out of the way.
Liam: Fuck you, Sylas.
Matt: As the Death Knight kinda steps over to the side, you watch as this small sphere of darkness begins to (crackling sound) into his hand, and then throws it with an arc, in a 20-foot radius centered on a point that it chooses.
Sam: That's rough stuff.
Travis: You're a beholder, do you get legendary actions and resistances and shit?
Sam: I don't think-- I don't know.
Matt: It's legendary resistances, not actions.
Sam: What's a legendary resistance?
Matt: You get to reroll-- Unless it doesn't have it.
Sam: This doesn't.
Matt: No, the beholder does not. It's not that powerful. All right, I need Pike, Grog--it's a dexterity saving throw. So Grog and Scanlan automatically fail. Percival and Pike, I need you both to make dexterity saving throws, please.
Ashley: Okay. Oh, fuck.
Taliesin: Yeah. 20.
Ashley: (brightly) Six!
Laura: Wait! Oh, I thought that was ten.
Taliesin: I have advantage also, against--
Matt: Right. You take a total of 35 points of fire and necrotic damage. You take 35 points of necrotic damage, and because you're resistant to fire, you only take 17 points of fire damage. 35 points.
Ashley: Did you say 17, Matt?
Matt: 17, yes.
Matt: Scanlan? And Grog. You both take-- Actually no, since you have resistance to fire-- Which actually, your form is, I should give you the large form.
Sam: I added wrong. Wait, wait! Stop everything.
Matt: Yes? What're you stoppin'?
Sam: I added wrong. My saving throw was a 23.
Matt: Was a 23?
Laura: On being held?
Matt: On being held? Still fails.
Sam: Oh!
Travis: Yeah, you did a 24, right?
Marisha: I rolled like a 27.
Laura: She rolled a 27.
Travis: 27, yeah. We gotta go!
Laura: There's nowhere-- We're gonna die.
Sam: So what did I just get hit with? 70 points or something?
Matt: You took 70 points of fire and necrotic damage.
Sam: Awesome.
Taliesin: Do you have resistance to any of that?
Matt: Not as a beholder, no. Okay, that ends the Death Knight's turn.
Travis: I mean, he's just dunking on us.
Taliesin: Well, they're top-loading. They're top-loading.
Matt: Vex. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Travis: Crotch in face.
Matt: That's cocked, roll again.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Nope, still locked in place.
Travis: Oh, for the wisdom save?
Matt: Pike.
Ashley: Okay. All right, I'm going to touch Grog and cast Lesser Restoration.
Matt: Okay, which cures...?
Ashley: Paralysis.
Matt: Then, yeah.
Ashley: Okay. So I've just got to run around.
Matt: Grog, you are cured of paralysis.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: Do that a lot.
Matt: You feel your form freed of the effect of the spell. Do you want to move?
Ashley: How many undead are there?
Matt: There are one, two, three, four, five over there.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: You already used your action to cast a spell, so.
Ashley: Yeah. So, as my bonus action, I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Which will just add two to your AC.
Taliesin: Oh, thank you!
Matt: What level is Shield of Faith?
Ashley: First level.
Matt: Okay, yeah. So there you go. Just mark that for yourself.
Taliesin: Oh, it's on!
Matt: All righty. Do you want to move, or are you going to stay where you are, Pike?
Taliesin: You've got a Death Knight, if you're feeling frisky.
Travis: Do you want to move or stay where you are?
Ashley: Okay. Sorry. I'm going to hide behind the beholder.
Matt: Okay, so you move around Grog and get right about there. That ends your turn, Pike. Vax, make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: I'm going to attempt to roll a natural 20.
Marisha: You have advantage on everything.
Liam: I know.
Marisha: That's good. That's okay.
Liam: It's not a natural 20, though, which is what it's going to take. I'm going to use Luck.
Marisha: Oh my god, you rolled a 19.
Liam: 18 and a 19.
Sam: Plus anything?
Liam: Plus two. Gets me to 21. I need a natural 20. Luck. No. Okay.
Matt: That ends your turn, Vax. Percival.
Taliesin: I'm going to scoot against the wall towards myself as far as a reasonable amount of movement will take me because I don't like clumping. I'm going to take aim at the asshole in the sky, and let's do a couple of things. I'm going to take Bad News out, and just to keep everything reasonable, I'm going to burn a point for dead-eye, and I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot on him.
Matt: Okay, so minus five to the attack roll.
Taliesin: Minus five to the attack. That's a crit! That's a crit.
Matt: You rolled a 19, yeah, which you have now at level 18.
Taliesin: At level 18, that's a crit.
Matt: This is with which gun?
Taliesin: This is with Bad News, so that's going to be 2d12. That's going to be 4d12 plus six.
Matt: This is Bad News, you said?
Taliesin: Bad News. I don't know if this also doubles-- I don't think it does-- but I'm pouring all of Cabal's Ruin into this shit, too.
Matt: Go ahead and roll the Cabal's Ruin damage. The actual hit from Bad News does nothing.
Taliesin: Oh, really?
Matt: The non-enchanted attack from Bad News hits and dissipates across his form. It's not half damage. Nothing. This is Vecna. Cabal's Ruin is considered magical damage, so that will go through.
Marisha: Was that the one you critted on?
Taliesin: Yeah, I burned a crit.
Matt: You gained the grit back, though.
Taliesin: The grit's not burned, so that's nice. These don't double, do they?
Matt: No. Wait, technically, they would. Technically, they do, because it is a crit. All dice double, yeah.
Ashley: Get him!
Taliesin: Does my other rule also apply to this? Does this add to bleed damage now? Maybe not.
Matt: I don't think so, because it's an outside effect.
Taliesin: It's an outside factor. That's fine. I'm with you.
Matt: No, you know what? It would because just like any other critical effect, yes, it would.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: It would.
Taliesin: (counting) 32. That's 32.
Marisha: Did you count that one?
Taliesin: 36 points of damage, times two.
Laura: 72.
Matt: 72.
Taliesin: 72 points of electrical damage, and then he's also going to get a bleed of 31. No, he's going to get a bleed of 15.
Matt: He will get 15 because he's resistant to lightning, so he takes half of that next time.
Taliesin: But he still has to roll concentration.
Matt: Yeah, for 36.
Taliesin: I'll take it, and goodbye, Cabal. I'll gain more when he hits me with some magic shit.
Sam: Oh boy.
Laura: It's such an anti-climactic fight because none of us can do anything.
Matt: That would be 18 as half that. DC is 18 to maintain concentration. Yeah, he saves.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it!
Matt: Barely. By one.
Travis: By one?
Matt: By one.
Laura: On concentration?
Taliesin: Damn it. I was debating whether or not to hit him with Hex, and now I'm so sad I didn't. Oh, well. That's okay. I'm reloading, and I'm going to take another Bad News shot at Delilah. Where is she?
Matt: She's over here.
Taliesin: What is she doing?
Matt: She just stepped over Vax's paralyzed body and threw a Finger of Death at Vex.
Taliesin: Okay. Let's burn that little bit of Animus again and burn that grit point again for advantage. Let's hit her with Bad News. Actually, I'll cast... Hex on her, as well, just for fun.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And give her constitution disadvantage. Actually, let's give her, just in case she gets grappled-- let's make it constitution disadvantage. Fuck it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And then I've got bonus, and I'm doing sharpshooter again. Thank god I did because that was a terrible shot. That's 14.
Matt: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you go to fire--
Ashley: Do we know what would hit?
Taliesin: We don't.
Ashley: War God's Blessing to add ten?
Matt: Gives a plus ten?
Taliesin: Oh, that would definitely hit, I'd imagine.
Matt: You use War God's Blessing as a reaction onto Percy. As you go to fire, you feel the presence of Sarenrae coalesce around the blade, and you hear a little whisper over your shoulder say, "There." And all of a sudden, clarity comes into frame and (gunshot) you fire Bad News towards Delilah. Go ahead and roll damage on that. She's not even going to spend a Shield on that. It's way over her AC.
Taliesin: Not bad. That's (counting) 20 points of piercing damage and five points of necrotic damage.
Matt: (gunshot) It blasts, and you see the robe tear open on one side. She's like (cries out, breathes heavily).
Taliesin: That's my roll.
Matt: You glance over with the scope and see as she turns and looks at you. You can see, what you didn't see earlier, is one normal eye she has and one yellowish-green eye with a cat-slit pupil.
Taliesin: Shit.
Laura: What does that even mean?
Taliesin: Vecna's been busy. Okay. This is going to get interesting.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Percy.
Taliesin: That's all I can do.
Matt: Scanlan, go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I can't move my eyes or anything or turn on my anti-magic?
Matt: As far as the ray that you have, the eye perspective, you're hitting right there, so you're just out of range to get rid of the paralysis from Vex and off Vax. If you manage to break from this somehow and you rotate, the spell would have no effect while it's on them.
Marisha: They're broken from it by being in his gaze? Am I in his gaze?
Matt: No, you are not.
Marisha: So I can still cast spells. But if I move into his gaze, I cannot.
Matt: Correct. Or if you shoot something through the cone, it will dissipate.
Marisha: If I shoot up at Vecna, will it go through the cone?
Matt: Yeah, probably. You're just outside of it.
Marisha: I will not go through the cone?
Matt: Probably. You can angle it that way, yeah. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: It is now my turn.
Matt: Also, I need you to make a concentration check.
Sam: Oh, my spell.
Matt: Yeah, transformation.
Sam: I get advantage as a gnome.
Matt: You do. How much damage did you take on that one, total, from the blast? From the blast that you took on that.
Sam: 70 points.
Matt: You have to beat a 35.
Sam: Okay. As a wisdom?
Matt: That would have been concentration. Constitution saving throw.
Sam: Constitution saving throw.
Matt: In theory, Scanlan, before it came to your turn, you dropped your beholder form.
Sam: Oh! I'm no longer paralyzed.
Matt: The spell maintains itself.
Sam: No! But I'm a different guy!
Matt: It's your mind it affects.
Marisha: Why?
Matt: Any spell still carries over the effects on you. You can't wild shape and--
Marisha: He lost concentration?
Matt: He lost concentration on his big spell, yeah.
Sam: Hey, guys.
Laura: Hey, Scanlan!
Matt: I'll let you remake that saving throw with your constitution. Sorry, your wisdom. With Scanlan's wisdom.
Sam: Okay, do I get advantage because of magic?
Matt: Yes, because it is magic.
Sam: And can I inspire myself?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Sam: All right. I will inspire myself. 24.
Matt: 24 is just enough. (relieved laughter)
Matt: You shrug off the paralysis at the end of your turn. You're now free to move.
Sam: Just move. I can't act, right?
Matt: No, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Is he 60 feet away from me? Is he within range?
Matt: Who?
Marisha: Should I handle Delilah, or should I handle him?
Travis: What're you doing? Which one do you want?
Sam: I can move now, or just in general?
Matt: No, next turn you'll be able to move.
Marisha: Is he within 60 feet of me? Vecna.
Matt: You're not sure. You'd have to eyeball it.
Marisha: (counting) He's exactly 60 feet in the air. I have to get directly under his butthole. Can I get directly under his butthole?
Matt: You can move through Trinket. You'll get two attacks of opportunity from two skeletons.
Marisha: Jesus, balls.
Liam: Jesus balls.
Matt: You'd have to leapfrog over Trinket to get there, but you can do it.
Marisha: What about Delilah. Where is she?
Matt: Delilah's over here. She and two skeletons right now are lording over the paralyzed Vax on the ground.
Marisha: If I move at all, I'm going to take opportunity from skeletons.
Matt: Yep. They don't do a whole lot of damage, but damage adds up.
Marisha: Jesus. Okay, I am going to head to Delilah. I can move up to her, correct?
Matt: You're going to move straight up to her?
Marisha: Can I?
Matt: You can, yeah. Both skeletons get attacks of opportunity on you. That's a nine and a 12. They both hit you, but the mantle writhes out in front of you. You watch as various leaves unfurl almost like a cat's fur on the back of its neck, and it deflects the blows from the skeletons as you rush past.
Marisha: I can give her disadvantage on constitution checks, and whenever she takes damage, she's stunned, or should I do the confusion thing?
Taliesin: Either one. They're both good. Go for the first one. Pick one.
Marisha: I'm turning into Ashley Johnson. Okay.
Ashley: Okay!
Marisha: I'm going to go up to Delilah. (pants) Cotton mouth. Oh boy. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to go up to her and be like, experience what you've been putting all of us through. And I'm going to touch her and I'm going to try and cast Contagion on her with Mind Fire?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Mind Fire!
Liam: Sounds good.
Taliesin: Hit her with a mind bullet.
Travis: Mind bullets!
Taliesin: That's telekinesis, Kyle!
Marisha: That's telekinesis, Kyle!
Travis: (singing) How about the power to move you?
Taliesin: (singing) How about the power to move you?
Marisha: (singing) How about the power to move you?
Matt: Make a melee spell attack.
Marisha: I have a bonus to my spell attacks.
Laura: You've got this!
Marisha: It's cocked. That's even worse. Not great. 18?
Matt: 18 is exactly what you needed. That's her armor class.
Liam: (singing) We'll fucking lead as two kings!
Travis: (laughing) Tenacious D for the rest of this fight, please.
Matt: She now is affected by Mind Fire.
Marisha: Her mind becomes feverish, and she has disadvantage on intelligence checks and intelligence saving throws, and she becomes confused.
Sam: What does that mean? What does confused mean?
Marisha: For seven days.
Liam: It sounds like she can't cast spells too well.
Marisha: Hopefully.
Matt: She's now considered confused. She's under the effects of the Confusion spell for as long as it lasts.
Taliesin: That's me under the effects of being confused about the Confusion spell.
Matt: Does that end your turn, Keyleth?
Taliesin: What do you have for a bonus?
Marisha: I don't have a lot for a bonus. I can go into an elemental form.
Travis: If we attack her, is that going to drop the confusion?
Taliesin: Yeah, can we attack her?
Marisha: No, it just lasts for seven days.
Matt: It lasts for seven days if she fails the saves. She has three saves in a row, and if she succeeds, it goes away. If she fails, it lasts for seven days.
Marisha: Okay. She has to make constitution saving throws. But she's under the effects right now, correct? We've been through this before, haven't we?
Laura: Oh, yeah. This is one of the ones we tried a long time ago.
Marisha: It says after failing three of these saving throws, the disease effects last for the duration, so that would make me assume that she has it at least for three rounds.
Matt: We had this discussion before, because in the ability, it has Slimy Doom, which whenever it takes damage, it becomes stunned, which is the most broken--
Marisha: I almost did that.
Matt: I know, but I think the DND ruling, technically, they have to fail three saves before it affects them.
Marisha: But it's a 5th-level fucking spell. That's a lot!
Matt: I know.
Marisha: That's lame. Three rounds for a 5th-level spell?
Matt: Look. I'll say this. I'll let Mind Fire work on her for now.
Marisha: Oh, he doesn't look happy. I feel like I just pissed off the DM.
Matt: No, you didn't piss off the DM. This spell has a lot of contention in the community, but the official DND ruling was it doesn't affect until they fail all three rolls, but as it's written, it doesn't say that. It says they're afflicted on being hit, so I'm letting it go through because you didn't choose the cheesy-ass stun-lock broken spell.
Marisha: It does say that after succeeding on three of these, the creature recovers from the disease, so they were already affected.
Matt: Which is what I'm saying. This is between what's written in the spell and the arguments that people have made with DND on Twitter, and they clarified that's not how it works. It's a mis-type. It wasn't clear. I'm letting it work. Be happy with the book.
Laura: Stop making eye contact. Look down!
Matt: At the end of your turn, Vecna's going to use some legendary actions to cast a spell. (groaning)
Travis: How about you just say he did, and don't?
Ashley: Yeah. Let's not and say we did.
Liam: He could just evil monologue a little bit, tell us his plan?
Laura: He's really good at evil monologuing.
Taliesin: We were talking about how much you wanted a monologue. I really feel like this is the moment.
Matt: He's going to cast a 7th-level Fireball right there.
Travis: 7th-level Fireball?
Taliesin: That's the end of Vax.
Travis: We've got to go.
Matt: I need Keyleth, Vax-- you don't auto-save, yeah.
Liam: Good night.
Travis: Maybe the Raven Queen will use you or something.
Liam: I can't. It's an automatic fail because I'm paralyzed.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: That's actually good. He'll lose the paralysis because he'll be in a coma. We'll just wake you back up and you'll be fine. It's actually kind of good.
Matt: Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, please. The skeletons are obliterated.
Marisha: That's a natural one.
Travis: Are you serious?! Are you serious?
Taliesin: I'm looking at it.
Matt: That's a surprisingly shitty roll. 38 points of fire damage to Vax. 38.
Travis: On a 7th-level Fireball?
Matt: I know. I rolled really shitty.
Marisha: 38?
Matt: 38 to you, as well. 38 to Vex. And 38 to Trinket.
Taliesin: That's a small-- that's a dire armadillo. That's okay.
Laura: 38 to Trinket?
Travis: Did Delilah take all that damage, too?
Matt: Delilah? Yeah, she did. She can't save against his shit. She takes it and (grunts).
Liam: She probably kind of likes it.
Laura: She's like, ooh.
Taliesin: Burn. Sick burn.
Matt: It made sense for the circumstance. She's up for the sacrifice. All righty, that ends Keyleth's turn. Top of the round. Now it's Vecna's go.
Travis: I thought that was Vecna's go.
Laura: That was his legendary.
Travis: Oh god.
Laura: I like that you have an enlarged figure Grog. That's cool.
Travis: I thought you were complimenting the DM. I was like, yeah, keep it up.
Laura: I like that you made an enlarged figure for Grog.
Sam: I'll kill you last.
Laura: Oh my god, this map is so pretty. (laughter)
Sam: What is that thing in the middle of the field?
Matt: This is the altar.
Laura: Whatever it is, it's really cool.
Ashley: Can we see what's in it?
Matt: You'd have to go check it out, if there was anything.
Marisha: Is he moving towards the altar?
Matt: He's shifting in the center and looking down for a bit. He goes, "Well, sleep."
Taliesin: Can he do that with concentration?
Matt: This is not a concentration spell.
Laura: Magic can't put me to sleep.
Matt: He casts Power Word Kill.
Sam: Oh. Well, that's different.
Liam: Where did Sleep go?
Matt: That's just what he said.
Sam: He meant metaphorical. He meant death.
Matt: You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you see within range to die instantly. If the creature you chose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. How many hit points do you have?
Laura: I'm dead. Insta-full death?
Matt: Insta-full death.
Marisha: No saving from it?
Matt: No.
Ashley: Wait, what?
Taliesin: What?
Sam: Perma-death?
Matt: No death saving throws. You watch as the life suddenly fades from Vex's eyes, and she falls to the ground.
Liam: Vax is watching, frozen.
Travis: Oh my god.
Laura: Hey, don't compliment the map, you guys. Matt really doesn't like it.
Matt: I'm sorry. It's now Delilah's turn.
Taliesin: This is not going well.
Sam: Maybe we should leave.
Travis: Plane Shift?
Matt: She turns and looks at you, Keyleth, and goes--
Sam: Is this Delilah?
Matt: This is Delilah. "You took him from me. Now I'm going to take him from you." She points down.
Sam: I thought she was confused.
Matt: I have to check what she does now. This may make the change.
Liam: Well, we weren't technically dating when we killed her, so I'm not really sure if she'd know.
Matt: I get to roll a d10.
Marisha: Let's hope he doesn't roll a nine or a ten, y'all.
Matt: A ten.
Marisha: You are fucking lying to me! (groans)
Matt: It's right there.
Travis: Yeah, I see it.
Taliesin: Oh shit. Wow, you really went down.
Matt: I'm sorry. I'm rolling really well. I'm sorry, guys.
Liam: Yeah, but that Fireball was super low.
Matt: All right, so do I have to roll for an attack on this? Creature has to make a dexterity saving throw. Hold on.
Taliesin: I don't know what to do.
Matt: That's 76 points of damage from the Disintegrate spell.
Liam: Halved from the Deathwalker's Ward. It's set to necromantic.
Matt: It's force damage. Disintegrate's force damage.
Liam: Oh. Well, then I'm down.
Marisha: No, that means he's disintegrated.
Matt: You watch as Vax's form (fluttering noise) turns to dust.
Sam: Wait, what?
Matt: Leaving the armor of the Raven Queen empty on the ground, the daggers (clattering).
Laura: No body left?
Marisha: There's no recovering from that, dude.
Laura: Bro. We're gone.
Taliesin: Wow.
Matt: Grog, it's your turn.
Sam: What's happening?
Laura: I thought this campaign was going to last longer than this.
Liam: I said this was the last episode, and I meant it.
Taliesin: You are a terrible person. Oh no.
Sam: With Foresight? Oh, because you're paralyzed. Oh fuck.
Marisha: She doesn't have to roll against that?
Matt: It's a dexterity saving throw, but he's still paralyzed.
Marisha: He doesn't get advantage?
Matt: You automatically fail dex saving throws when you're paralyzed.
Taliesin: You can't dex out of something if you can't move.
Travis: If I throw you over to her, can you Revivify?
Sam: I'm too far to do anything, right?
Matt: At the moment?
Sam: It has to be within 60 feet.
Matt: From Delilah? She's within 40 feet of you.
Sam: Can I retroactively Counterspell? (laughs)
Matt: Yeah. I'll let you do it. You have your ability back, so I'll let you try for it.
Marisha: Wait, with the Disintegrate? Go, Scanlan, go!
Travis: Do you have to roll for this?
Sam: I think I have to roll for this.
Matt: You roll and add your charisma modifier.
Sam: No. Charisma modifier? It's just an 11.
Matt: Plus two, because you get plus two bonus, so 13.
Sam: I can't add anything else.
Laura: Can you inspire yourself?
Taliesin: Can you inspire yourself?
Marisha: Can you inspire yourself?
Sam: Not on a reaction, I don't think.
Marisha: But you're a war bard, right?
Matt: He's not a war bard. He's a lore bard.
Marisha: War caster.
Taliesin: Oh man, this does not feel good.
Sam: Doesn't feel good.
Taliesin: It does not feel good.
Matt: Peerless skill. When you make an ability check. It's an ability check, technically.
Sam: What's that mean?
Matt: That means you can spend another bardic inspiration to it because you're at a 13.
Sam: (nervous laughter) It's cocked. It would have been 11. Four.
Matt: It's a 17? The spell is a 6th-level spell. The DC is 16.
Taliesin: Oh god!
Laura: You're not disintegrated?
Travis: Are you serious?
Sam: Matt is a gentle god.
Matt: In this flash of vision, Keyleth, you see this happen, and then the bit of inspiration from the Raven Queen that's been trying to push through whatever is keeping her vision at bay here. Your vision flashes back, and then you see Vax on the ground, the extended finger of Delilah as the green energy begins to spiral up from her finger, and Scanlan in the back just says?
Sam: Oh. Hey, you know what the problem is with your face? I can see it! (laughter)
Matt: Delilah goes, "What?" and the spell (fluttering noise) dissipates. (sighs)
Marisha: That was a 6th-level spell?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Does she have any more of those?
Laura: We don't know.
Marisha: Because I only have two.
Matt: That being the case, Delilah is going to go ahead and go. You do get an attack of opportunity on her, Keyleth.
Marisha: Just straight melee?
Matt: Straight melee.
Taliesin: Hit her with a stick.
Marisha: My dice suck.
Laura: You've rolled shit on that dice every time tonight.
Marisha: It's not good. 13.
Matt: 13? No, that misses, unfortunately.
Marisha: Fuck it.
Matt: Okay. Grog, it's your turn now.
Travis: Sure. Can I use my-- are we doing this?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Can I use my action to pick up my buddy Pike, and I'm going to try and throw her as far as I can towards where Vex's body is laying.
Matt: Okay, so you're going to pick her up and move?
Travis: There's no difference, right?
Matt: You can pick her up and move and then throw her to give her the most distance, but you can only move half your speed as you're carrying her. It's essentially an agreed-upon grapple. You'd be able to move 25 feet with her.
Travis: Versus picking her up and throwing her for an athletics check, or something?
Matt: You can, but I don't know how far you'll throw her that way. It's up to you. You can stay where you are, if you'd like to.
Ashley: I'll make it.
Travis: You think so?
Ashley: Yeah. I can make it to her.
Liam: The initiative is Grog, Pike, Vax right now.
Travis: I should just go unload?
Ashley: Yeah, do your thing.
Travis: I would like to rage.
Matt: You are raging.
Travis: Can I use my full speed to head towards Delilah?
Matt: (counting) That's as far as you can get right there.
Travis: With my bonus action, can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to leap horizontally 20 feet? I want to get within melee.
Matt: Okay, make an athletics check.
Travis: That's a million. 25.
Matt: (impact) You land right in front of her. She watches you as you (footsteps) run around the side, leap, (impact) right in front of her, this giant, hulking form of muscle.
Travis: Yeah. Reckless, great weapon master.
Taliesin: Turn her to fucking paste.
Matt: You have two attacks.
Travis: Yeah, two attacks.
Marisha: Why am I light-headed?
Travis: Everything's going wrong.
Taliesin: Well, that, and those drinks were really inappropriate.
Travis: 28?
Matt: 28? Yeah, that hits.
Travis: 19. 29. 35, and four because I'm enlarged. 35, total on the first one. And the second one, 19. Should have taken that other thing. That would have been a crit. Minus five. 27?
Matt: 27 does hit, yes.
Travis: Boy, she's got a high AC, doesn't she? 10, 24, 34, three points of necrotic for 37. That's a d8. That's the wrong one. 36 points of damage.
Matt: As you rush forward and cleave into her with hit after hit on the axe, you watch as her imposing form is battered around and slashed apart, and as you finish and withdraw the axe from the two strikes, you see her already clutching her stomach. (panting)
Travis: An action surge is a bonus action, right?
Matt: No. Just an action surge.
Taliesin: You can just do it.
Travis: Should we empty the tank?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: I'll use the action surge.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Taliesin: Is that three more attacks?
Matt: Two more.
Travis: Reckless, great weapon, all the shit. Goddamn, that was two 19s in a row. If I'd picked that other thing, they would have been criticals. 28.
Matt: 28 hits, definitely.
Travis: 17, 27, 29. That's a fucking d8 again. 31.
Matt: 31?
Travis: 31 points of damage.
Matt: All righty. Second attack?
Travis: 27.
Matt: Jesus. Yes, that hits.
Travis: I'm a monstrous thing. That's a 12, 26, 36, 38, 40, including the enlarged and the necrotic.
Matt: You slam her with the two extra attacks, knocking her back. As the two additional axe blows slice across the front of her chest, one gets her on the side of her chin. You can see, you've carved the cheek open and broken teeth, and now when she looks back to you, you can see all of her back molars and teeth now, this horrible Joker grin on one side of her face as the blood leaks out. You can see the one gleaming greenish-yellow glowing eye flares open at you. She (spits).
Travis: Don't stop smiling on my account.
Matt: That ends your turn, Grog... All right, so ghostly claws begin to spring up from the ground in a 20-foot radius.
Travis: Did you say claws?
Matt: Claws, yes.
Sam: Ghostly claws.
Matt: Right there. I need-- Vax fails. I need Keyleth and Grog and Trinket to all make dexterity saving throws. Sorry, strength saving throws.
Laura: He can't do anything.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil!
Taliesin: Trinket can.
Laura: Trinket can't still attack if I'm not alive.
Matt: I'll let you. I'll let you, in the purposes of you being dead, Trinket is going to act on his own to defend you.
Laura: He rolled a seven.
Taliesin: He's about to be in a pocket dimension really quick.
Laura: Yeah, he might go into the pocket dimension.
Matt: Grog?
Travis: 22.
Matt: 22. You take five points of necrotic damage, and are not grappled. You take ten points of necrotic damage, reduced to half, five, because of your armor, and you are grappled and paralyzed. Keyleth?
Marisha: 22.
Matt: 22. You take five points of necrotic damage.
Laura: And Trinket takes how much necrotic damage?
Matt: Ten, and is grappled. Trinket's speed is zero. All right. Welcome to the God Wars, guys.
Taliesin: Not cool.
Marisha: Why didn't we Heroes' Feast?
Laura: It wouldn't have mattered.
Liam: Let's get a god in here. Light or dark meat. I don't care. One or the other. Get one of those ladies in here!
Matt: (heavy footfalls) With these heavy, armored footfalls as it walks, with its fingers forward, it begins carving this sigil in the air. Grabs it and turns it, and as it turns, you watch the same sigil runes appear around Grog and begin to spiral around you. Make a charisma saving throw, please.
Travis: Fuck, balls. Hey, y'all, plus one. Don't worry. Four.
Matt: Grog, you vanish. (groaning)
Matt: Banished from this realm of existence.
Travis: No!
Matt: You appear on the ground in the Shadowfell, in the gaping crater where Thar Amphala once stood. You look around, up to the familiar cloudy, dark sky, and are alone.
Travis: Wait. Y'all aren't in the Shadowfell anymore?
Taliesin: No.
Travis: Oh, right. Snow's falling.
Laura: Wildemount, or some shit.
Travis: Without a perception check, is anybody around, or is it just me?
Matt: Nobody's around you, although you do look up and see maybe a dozen or so of the gloom stalkers, swirling up ahead. They haven't noticed you yet.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it.
Sam: You've been banished to another dimension. You can punch your way out of it.
Travis: You know what? I only have one thought.
Marisha: Oh no. He's going to turn to the cards, y'all. He's going to turn to those cards.
Travis: We've got this.
Matt: Keyleth, perception check.
Marisha: What?
Matt: Perception check.
Marisha: Ugh! Okay. That's good. 14 plus 13, so 27.
Matt: You do notice, the armored death knight still has a hand out after Grog's banishing.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Okay, that's good!
Matt: This doesn't appear to be Plane Shift.
Marisha: So if I kill him, he'll come back? Or if I kill him, Grog won't ever come back? What does that mean?!
Taliesin: We'll find out. We'll just lay waste to shit until it stops happening. We're going to keep doing terrible shit until terrible shit stops happening.
Liam: Pickle time.
Travis: This is the worst grin you've ever given us. It's so great.
Matt: We are at the end of the death knight's turn. Vecna's going to use two legendary actions to cast another spell.
Ashley: This feels like when we played in Liam's one-shot when we got on the beach.
Liam: I was just about to say, this is revenge for Demogorgon!
Taliesin: This is very much the beach, isn't it?
Matt: Vecna's going to shift further back on the field to there.
Marisha: Is he always going to fucking fly?
Matt: Why wouldn't he?
Taliesin: Feet are passe.
Matt: As he glides over, he looks down and sees the mess that Delilah's currently in. Looks around and sees the options and says, "Well, I hate to see work unfinished."
Sam: Again?
Liam: Disintegrate?
Matt: Disintegrate again.
Sam: This is the same round, right?
Matt: This is the next round.
Sam: Can I try--
Matt: He moved out of your range.
Sam: Great.
Marisha: No!
Matt: Now you see as a green ray fires down from the Whispered One above, and within an instant--
Marisha: Wait, can I bonus action him? Can I use my bonus action?
Matt: Not on your turn.
Taliesin: I've got nothing.
Matt: You turn to dust within the armor. Where once Vax stood, the vision you saw flash you thought might have been a warning, instead it was an omen. You look down and see the raven wings turn to ash, and now there is the empty armor of the Raven Queen, the daggers clattering to the stone.
Travis: Oh man. What the fuck?
Matt: Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: I can't do what I was going to do. Fuck.
Sam: Laura.
Ashley: Okay. Sorry. Hold on.
Sam: She can't reach you?
Ashley: Nope.
Sam: I can bring you to her.
Matt: You could hold your action and he could bamf you over.
Ashley: When are you up?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: Do whatever you want.
Sam: You have to touch her?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: If you wanted to do something like that, you'd have to begin casting it and hold your action for him to take his turn, and then you could take her there.
Ashley: Wait, who's up?
Matt: It's you, Percy, then Scanlan.
Ashley: Okay, so Percy's next, and then it's Scanlan.
Sam: If we don't die in those two turns, yes.
Ashley: Okay. Oh my god, I'm shaking so bad. I will start casting Revivify, and I will hold my turn until Scanlan bamfs us.
Sam: I'm going to be a total dick and not do that.
Ashley: There's no one in between us?
Sam: No, we're next to each other.
Ashley: I mean, no one in between us, like the bad guys.
Sam: Well, they can go whenever they want.
Matt: Delilah already took her turn. Scanlan?
Sam: Oh, it's my turn. Where's Percy?
Matt: Sorry. Percy, you're up next.
Taliesin: I'm going to unload a few rounds of Animus into Delilah, since she's still standing. She's still standing?
Matt: She's still standing.
Taliesin: All right. Let's drop a point of grit, and let's get some advantage on this for Animus shot number one. Come on, crit. Not a crit, but still pretty decent. That's a 28 to hit?
Matt: 28 to hit? That will hit.
Taliesin: That's not the full damage. Let's do this, plus let's do that. That's 12 points of piercing damage, five points of psychic damage, and four points of necrotic damage.
Matt: Okay. Necrotic damage doesn't do anything, unfortunately.
Taliesin: I know. I'll keep that off, then, for now.
Matt: Okay. She's looking really hurt.
Taliesin: All right, let's take another shot. Same thing, burning a grit because fuck it. And let's make this one-- these are not the right dice to roll. I'm really nervous. Let's make this one a sharpshooter to see if we can pour a little more pain. Natural 20. That's a crit. Let's get that grit back.
Marisha: Kill her!
Taliesin: I've got to use my pen! Don't shake me! I shake so much on my own! That's 2d10 plus 2d6 psychic, so that's four points of psychic damage. That was a terrible roll. And 24 points of damage.
Marisha: Is that doubled?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's doubled. It was terrible.
Matt: How do you want to do this on Delilah?
Taliesin: (sighs) I take my second shot. I call, Delilah? Even if we die, it's fucking worth it. And I take it right in her good eye. I want me to be the last thing she sees.
Matt: As she turns around, you watch that side of her face explode, and she falls back, the force of it knocking her off her feet. She (impact noise) scatters across the stonework. You glance over, and you can see her looking face-up, and the little green eye in the socket turns and looks towards you.
Sam: Wait, it's still working?
Matt: The eye turned and looked at you from within the socket.
Taliesin: But it's down.
Sam: There's a creature inside of her.
Taliesin: Off. (sighs) For my third shot, Mr. Armor. And I get another grit back because she's dead. Armor. I'm taking-- what's he holding?
Matt: He currently has a longsword in one hand. That's all he's currently holding.
Taliesin: He's holding a longsword? Let's get rid of that longsword. I'm going to hit him and make him drop that longsword.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm burning a grit to make him drop it. I know, this is a lot. I'm taking my third shot with Animus, and this is going to be a sharpshooter shot, and that's not a crit, but that's pretty good. That's 29 to hit?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: All right, so this is 1d10 plus 1d6. That's terrible. That's 20 points of damage, two points of psychic damage, and he has to make a strength saving throw or he drops his sword. DC 20.
Matt: He gets a 20 exactly. 15 plus five. But he did take the damage, so he has to make a concentration, which he makes. DC 11, because it's half the damage.
Taliesin: Concentration? Oh, for that. That's fine. Just because we're at that point where I'm panicking, let's burn an action surge. Boom. Three more shots on the asshole.
Marisha: Are you shooting at Vecna?
Taliesin: No, Vecna I'm not shooting because he's laughing off my bullets.
Matt: Most of the impact deflects off the plate.
Marisha: You're shooting at the death knight?
Taliesin: I'm shooting at the death knight, so now I'm going to do a grit shot. I'm going to burn for dead-eye sharpshooter. That's 27?
Matt: 27? Okay, that hits.
Taliesin: And that's-- oh my fucking god! 20 points of damage, plus one point of psychic damage.
Sam: You're fine. You're good.
Taliesin: Burning another--
Sam: It's the last thing.
Taliesin: I've got more. I've got three more. I keep killing things. That's 17 to hit?
Matt: 17. You watch as he's concentrating on that one spell, and as the one shot hits him, the second one, he puts his arm up and seems to deflect it with his hand.
Taliesin: Did he make a constitution save against the last one?
Matt: Yes, he did.
Taliesin: Okay. This is my last shot. I'm burning another grit, and natural 20. Okay, so that's going to be-- come on. That's better!
Matt: I forgot to mention. Vecna took extra damage from your crit earlier.
Taliesin: Yes, he did. He took 15 points of extra damage, halved. 18, 21, 22, 23, 30 points of damage, plus five psychic damage, and he's going to take 15 points of damage, plus three psychic damage next round.
Matt: That was a 16 and a one, so with his constitution bonus, he saves. He maintains concentration.
Taliesin: Oh my fucking god!
Matt: It's hard to break. He was designed for that.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my bonus action to reload, and that's my fucking turn.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: That was a long turn.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: You did good.
Matt: All right. End of Percy's turn. Scanlan.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Percy, do you want to move on your turn?
Taliesin: No. There's nowhere. I'm as far away from everybody as I can currently be. There's nowhere else.
Matt: I'm letting you know, as it currently stands. Delilah's down.
Taliesin: Delilah's down.
Matt: And two figures that look pretty much untouched. Scanlan?
Marisha: What are you trying to say?
Matt: I'm saying, be mindful of your choices.
Taliesin: You know what? I'm going to start making a beeline straight for Keyleth. Fuck it. I'm going to see if I can get some cover behind--
Marisha: Are we going to bail? What do we do?
Taliesin: I'm fucking bailing.
Matt: That's up to you. You do have one of them down, and you have two--
Travis: If you can bail--
Marisha: But Grog.
Taliesin: We can get Grog back. We've just got to get everybody up.
Travis: You don't even know where I am.
Liam: You can find him.
Marisha: What about you?
Liam: I'm gone. There's no finding me. I'm gone.
Taliesin: We're picking up armor.
Matt: Scanlan?
Sam: I grab Pikey-poo and Dimension Door straight to Vex's beautiful dead body.
Travis: Like a dead Juliet.
Sam: I will inspire Pike. I don't know if that helps whatever ritual you're about to do, but maybe.
Travis: Revivify.
Taliesin: Revivify.
Ashley: What do you get if you're inspired?
Matt: You get a d12 that you can spend on something. Which, as you release Revivify, you reach down and grab the cold, lifeless hand of Vex. I need you to roll a wisdom check.
Sam: With inspiration.
Matt: Should she need it.
Ashley: And don't I get gnome cunning, so I have advantage on it?
Matt: No. It's not a saving throw. It's just a check. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Taliesin: We will grab everything we fucking can.
Ashley: 18.
Matt: 18? Yeah. Your breath comes in.
Ashley: Hi.
Laura: Pike. Are they dead?
Ashley: No.
Matt: You look over to your side, and you see Delilah on the ground, her head scattered and exploded on the ground, the one yellowish-green eye still moving around and taking in the scenery. You glance up, and you see Vecna still lording over, a big smile on his face. You see the other armored knight walking around, the plated black helmet guarding any expression except for these glowing red dots, the eyes that peer through.
Sam: I'm using any movement I have to pick up the dust of my fallen friend, if there is any dust.
Matt: There's the dust and his equipment. Those are the two things that are left.
Sam: Pick up whatever I can.
Marisha: Scoop him into a little vial.
Liam: (vacuuming noises) (laughter)
Sam: (fake sneeze) Oh no!
Taliesin: This is no time for allergies. Fuck!
Matt: All right, so you get your hands up in the armor and some dust and you gather it in your hand. There's Scanlan. There's you. There's Vex, Pike.
Marisha: So we're all together?
Matt: Well, Percy's there and Grog is somewhere.
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: I got as far as I could.
Sam: I'm done. That's all I can do.
Ashley: So bonus action.
Sam: I don't know if you can do a bonus action.
Ashley: Can I do a bonus action?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: Okay.
Taliesin: You need healing like a mother. Don't shrug at me.
Sam: She's fine.
Ashley: I'm going to cast Healing Word on Vex.
Matt: Level two?
Ashley: Level four.
Matt: Because you've already cast Revivify.
Ashley: Level two.
Matt: So 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier, I think.
Sam: I'm already rolling Vax.
Laura: You're mixing him with your suude?
Sam: Yeah.
Ashley: Ten hit points.
Sam: Tuck it behind my ear for later.
Taliesin: It doesn't matter anymore.
Laura: I haven't seen Vax yet. I haven't seen what happened.
Ashley: Can I move?
Matt: No, because you already took your turn.
Ashley: Oh my god.
Matt: So that ends your turn? Scanlan, you moved up there and you grabbed the stuff. That's your turn. Keyleth?
Marisha: Oh god. Okay. Are we trying to get to me so I can get us all out?
Sam: Yeah, but it's going to take another turn.
Laura: For Percy to get there.
Marisha: But everyone's coming this way, right? Everyone's coming this way? Then I'm going to-- fucking hell. How does Fire Storm work? I know it's ten ten-foot cubes. Does it have to be on the ground, or can I hit him up there? Can I rain-- "justice rains from above!" Can I do that?
Taliesin: I haven't touched that game in so long.
Matt: You can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Yeah, you can. Choose a location you see within range, so I don't see why you couldn't. You can create a lava fall, essentially.
Taliesin: You'd have to pick one of the two of them to hit.
Matt: You pick one, and then you create a bunch of cubes that chain off it.
Taliesin: You can hit them both.
Marisha: But I'm not going to be able to hit the death knight and Vecna?
Matt: Probably not. Not without hitting Scanlan or yourself in the process.
Marisha: What if I got out of the way. Could I?
Matt: We can try it.
Marisha: I'm going to do a bonus action and I'm going to go air elemental. Full-on, wrath of my people and my hometown, and I'm going to levitate in a cool tornado-y thing.
Matt: Are there any material components for Fire Storm? No, there is not. You can cast that in your form. You levitate up. We'll say right there.
Taliesin: There's a lot of dead bodies on the ground, man.
Matt: I know. This is rough, man. We'll say there.
Marisha: That's high, but that's okay.
Matt: How high did you want it?
Marisha: In between, but don't worry about it. I'm going to right onto Vecna and try and swarm it down towards the death knight.
Matt: How many cubes is it?
Marisha: Ten ten-foot cubes.
Matt: That's ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Just barely get him. Just barely.
Taliesin: That will do.
Matt: Hold on.
Marisha: What do you mean, hold on?
Travis: There are some legendary things that I think might be happening.
Taliesin: I get that vibe.
Matt: Not legendary. As you swarm up and begin to formulate the spell, Vecna looks at at you, and you can see with the vacant space where the hand is, there's almost an arcane flash of a hand that goes, (clicks tongue). He's going to attempt to Counterspell you.
Taliesin: Roll a one!
Marisha: What does he have to roll? Under my DC?
Matt: It has to beat your DC. No, sorry. The level of the spell, which would be 17. Which succeeds. He rolled a 14 plus ten, so 24. As you formulate the spell, you watch as the flames sputter out.
Laura: Can you come back down to the ground?
Marisha: Yeah, I'll try and levitate down a bit.
Matt: You were about there, and with your flying speed, you can land back down on the ground if you want. Sorry. Is that your turn, Keyleth?
Marisha: I guess so.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: What does it look like when you're looking out at all of us and we're so sad?
Matt: It feels awful.
Travis: I love it!
Taliesin: You're a liar. You're a lying liar.
Matt: It legitimately feels awful, but we were building to this for a long time. I've got to play it.
Travis: There's a god floating in the air.
Matt: Not a god yet.
Travis: Not a god yet.
Matt: That you know of.
Laura: He'll be a god in our next damn campaign when we're all dead.
Matt: He's going to use his last legendary action at the end of Keyleth's turn to cast a cantrip at you, Vex, as you just got back to consciousness. He's going to reach out with a Flame Bolt.
Laura: It's because I called him a dipshit when he was talking earlier.
Travis: You did blurt that out.
Matt: You did. You did taunt him.
Laura: He is a dipshit. Before he does his cantrip, I'm going to go, you can go ahead and live forever, but you'll still be fucking ugly the whole damn time! (laughter)
Matt: Disadvantage because you're prone on the ground and it's a ranged attack. That is a two plus 16. That is an 18.
Laura: To my armor class? He doesn't hit.
Matt: I rolled a natural 20 and a two, by the way, so if you weren't prone?
Taliesin: He would have--
Laura: Destroyed me.
Travis: You would be dust.
Matt: As he points down with his still-missing hand, releases this bolt and you see this flare up in the air and rush towards you, and you roll out of the way and it (impact noise) slams into the stone below you. You hear it crack and break the area where your head once was. Now it's Vecna's turn.
Travis: Now. (laughs) Now?
Ashley: That wasn't his turn?
Matt: That was a legendary action.
Ashley: That was a legendary action? That's right. I don't want any of it!
Taliesin: None of us want this.
Travis: I don't want it! I don't like it!
Ashley: I don't even want to play.
Travis: Taryon's back in Whitestone having a fucking ball.
Taliesin: Taryon's sitting with a cup of tea.
Sam: No, Taryon's on the floor, weeping, holding his necklace.
All: Oh!
Ashley: He doesn't know who it is.
Taliesin: We've got one way down. We are all having the thumpa-thumpa right now.
Laura: It's red. All flashing red.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Why did you say okay that way?
Sam: Liam can be Taryon now! (laughs)
Taliesin: You're terrible.
Sam: No! It's an established character we already have artwork for. Why let it go to waste? He's done prissy boys before.
Travis: Look at Matt's face.
Matt: Vecna's going to lean down, seeing that you just brought life back to Vex--
Travis: Don't you do it!
Laura: Matthew, don't do it!
Matt: "Join your friend."
All: No!
Sam: I will 6th-level Counterspell. (cheering)
Travis: We will not go quietly into the night!
Sam: I will sing at him, (singing) Counterspell, baby don't hurt me. Don't hurt me no more. Counterspell!
Matt: Okay. Roll a d20.
Matt: It's a 7th-level Finger of Death.
Laura: Is that a natural 20?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: Scanlan! No!
Travis: What is this up and down cardiac arrrest game?
Matt: Natural one?
Taliesin: Stop rolling that die.
Laura: And you're below 100?
Travis: It really is a one?
Taliesin: It really was a one.
Sam: I can add things to it, right?
Taliesin: No, you can't.
Matt: 7d8. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Ashley: I make a constitution saving throw? Okay.
Sam: You're still inspired.
Laura: You're inspired!
Ashley: "You're spired!"
Laura: Inspired. Use it!
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: It's a d10, right?
Sam: d12 on top of that.
Matt: What did you roll?
Ashley: 13.
Liam: Plus the inspiration.
Ashley: No, just the 13. Plus-- 19?
Matt: No. You take 67 points of necrotic damage.
Laura: It wasn't Power Word Kill, it was Finger of Death?
Matt: No, he'd already used his Power Word Kill. Remember, he's not a god yet.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Just the one. Just the one Power Word Kill.
Travis: The fact that he's not a god gives me diarrhea feelings.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: All right, and he's going to move back a bit, frustrated at the--
Sam: At everything.
Matt: At your attempts to Counterspell. Actually, no. He laughed at that. "Nice try."
Sam: It wasn't my best performance.
Matt: All right, that's going to end his turn. Delilah's out. Grog.
Travis: (laughs)
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Travis: Cool. Right. Pass Without a Trace is still going, right?
Matt: Nope.
Travis: That's a one.
Taliesin: Hello?
Matt: As you're there, Grog, you hear (screeching). A cloud of screeches, as about nine of these gloom stalkers all start (whoosh) going into a dive towards you.
Sam: Maybe one of them is our friend Mr. Mistoffelees.
Marisha: Mr. Mistoffelees, come back!
Travis: Am I going to do anything? How far away is the nearest structure?
Matt: Nothing. It's a crater. You're where the city used to be. You have at least a mile to each side of nothing but crater.
Taliesin: Fuck!
Ashley: He's all by his lonesome!
Taliesin: One more round.
Sam: He doesn't know.
Marisha: He could be stuck there forever!
Taliesin: There's nothing we can do right now.
Travis: I'm going to go into a frenzied rage, and I'm going to use my second wind to heal 1d10 plus my fighter level. Three, six. Six points, yay.
Taliesin: How close to you do we have to be?
Marisha: We have to be touching.
Sam: And you have to not be wind.
Marisha: I can be wind now.
Travis: I don't have any fighter things, so that's my turn.
Matt: That's your turn. Okay. Ending your turn. Dark energy suffuses the landscape in the area. Actually, no. I'm not going to use that one because nobody has necrotic resistance right now. More undead are going to pop up. Let's see how many. That's actually a shitty roll. Four undead pop up.
Taliesin: They're bullshit. We don't care.
Matt: All righty. That's going to be an attack on you. It has advantage because you're prone and it's in melee. That's a 17. Still doesn't hit. High armor. You're ducking out of the way. The skeleton is (tink) hitting the ground. It's also attacking at you, Pike. That's cocked. Natural one. It goes to strike you, and it doesn't even hit you. The holy symbol of Sarenrae flares, and it (raspy cry) pulls away from the blast of vibrant, radiant energy. There's going to be one attacking you, Scanlan. That is a 20 to hit?
Sam: Oh yeah.
Matt: All right. You take eight points of slashing damage. And attacking you, Percival, that's another 20.
Taliesin: That is my armor class.
Matt: It hits you. You take 11 points of slashing damage as it cuts through you.
Taliesin: I don't even acknowledge its existence. I am definitely not amused.
Marisha: What was the name of that one city, you guys?
Taliesin: Where is your dad from?
Marisha: Syngorn. Is Syngorn still in the Feywild?
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Marisha: Where did we go? What city in the Feywild did we go to?
Laura: We can go to the pond.
Travis: The death knight.
Matt: Steps forward, seeing Scanlan attempt to shrug off all these spells, comes rushing forward, and you watch as its blade begins to empower this dark, black shadow, similar to the gloom stalkers you've seen before. As he brings the sword and arcs it down with tremendous might, you hear the crack of thunder as this Staggering Smite slams into you, or tries to, at least.
Sam: That sounds bad.
Taliesin: That's bad. Do you have a reaction?
Sam: I used it already.
Matt: Shitty roll. 16 to hit?
Sam: Oh yeah, that hits.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I think I'm not attuned-- yeah.
Matt: You take ten points of slashing damage, plus 17 points of necrotic damage.
Taliesin: 27.
Matt: And as part of the Staggering Smite, you also take 14 points of psychic damage, and make a wisdom saving throw.
Sam: Against magic? That's better. 17.
Matt: 17? His spell DC is 18, unfortunately. On a failed save, you have a disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and you can't take reactions until the end of your next turn, so you can't Counterspell.
Taliesin: Scanlan's getting whaled on.
Sam: Disadvantage on all attack rolls?
Matt: Oh, but that's a concentration spell, so he's not going to maintain the concentration. You take the damage, and he lets it go. You don't have a disadvantage. Otherwise, he would lose other bits of concentration.
Laura: Other bits of concentration.
Matt: All right, so that brings us to Vex. Your turn.
Laura: (laughing) I get to go?
Matt: Yeah. Sorry!
Sam: You're alive.
Matt: Sorry, guys. You walked into the lion's den.
Laura: Oh yeah, we did.
Liam: I never did a single thing in this fight.
Laura: I know. This is the first thing I've done. I stand up.
Taliesin: If we're smart--
Marisha: I can bring you back.
Taliesin: I'm heading towards where you are. I'm heading towards the deceased body of Delilah.
Laura: I'm going to, as a bonus action, down my biggest healing potion, which is one greater healing potion.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: There's also a superior healing potion lying on the ground amongst all my shit.
Laura: No. It's in your armor.
Matt: Greater is 4d4 plus four.
Sam: Okay, it's something.
Laura: 13 plus four is 17 healing points, and I'm going to move closer to Keyleth.
Taliesin: She can move to us. Never mind.
Marisha: We have to all be holding hands, y'all.
Laura: Can I put myself in between Percy and Keyleth so I can reach my hand out?
Taliesin: I'm going to be making a beeline for everybody else. Everybody's in that big clump.
Laura: We're all in a clump, so we can still touch? I don't need to move anywhere in order to be able to touch her?
Taliesin: You'll be able to move before you cast Plane Shift, right?
Marisha: Yes.
Taliesin: So as long as we're all touching, she can get to us. We just need to clump, and I move last, so I'm fine. Is that right? Yeah, I move last.
Matt: Keyleth moves last. Keyleth and Scanlan.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to shoot at the death knight.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: With my 21?
Matt: 21 actually hits.
Laura: With my Blazing Bowstring, and I want to make it a bramble shot.
Travis: Hit him hard.
Laura: Is anybody standing next to him?
Matt: Scanlan and Keyleth.
Laura: Sweet.
Marisha: Feel free to hit me. I don't care. I can't be grappled.
Taliesin: Doesn't matter. She just gets extra points--
Marisha: Oh, he's flanked.
Laura: 23 plus eight is 31, right? 33 plus 1d6 lightning damage. 39, and then 3d6 sneak attack. 11 additional, so that's--
Travis: 50.
Laura: Oh, and the Blazing Bowstring. Six additional from that.
Matt: 56 points of damage from one shot. That is a 23 on his strength save, so as the arrow hits, you see the burst of flame. It pierces the armor, and you see the brambles extend and tear around him. He looks up at you and you watch as flames (fire noises) burn out of the armor. The arrow burns away, and the brambles ignite and fafll to ash around him.
Laura: Not surprising. What about his concentration?
Taliesin: Come on.
Matt: That's going to be... half of 56? Oh man, he's going to have to roll really high.
Taliesin: No!
Marisha: No!
Matt: Hold on. Half of 56 is--
Sam: 28.
Matt: 28. No, he rolled a 19 plus five. (cheering)
Matt: As the flames ignite and burn around, the impact still causes him to lose the spell, and you watch as a vacuum fills, and Grog, just as you see this barrage of gloom stalkers, ready to grab and tear you apart, you (poof) out and then (whoosh) appear in that space where you once were.
Travis: Huh?
Ashley: Grog! You're back!
Marisha: Grog, we've got to get out!
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Vex?
Laura: No, I get to attack him again.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: We're in a nice little clump, aren't we?
Laura: That one definitely hits. This is way less damage. 20 damage on the second one.
Matt: All righty. You can sense there's shadow and smoke pouring out from under the armor as the frustration of lost concentration is there. The second arrow hits the shoulder. Staring straight at you, angrily.
Laura: Keyleth, get us out of here?
Marisha: Hold hands.
Taliesin: I think we're all in physical contact, at this point, except for me.
Matt: That ends Vex's turn?
Laura: Where's Vax?
Taliesin: Well...
Marisha: We'll talk later!
Taliesin: Working on it. Do you have all of his stuff?
Sam: As much as I can carry.
Matt: Armor, daggers. Roll an investigation check.
Marisha: Dust?
Liam: Boots, his voice says from beyond the grave.
Sam: 30.
Matt: You rustled through the dust when you went through and spent the turn grabbing what you can. You get most of his important magical items.
Marisha: And dust.
Matt: And a little bit of dust.
Sam: Those boots are gone!
Taliesin: Next time we fight Vecna, he's going to be wearing some very nice boots.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: I'm kidding.
Liam: He'll be Finger of Deathing me double-time.
Ashley: Are we trying to get out of here? What are we doing?
Taliesin: We are trying to get out of here.
Ashley: But then what?! We still have to fight him!
Laura: Yeah, but then we'll be able to recover a little bit and figure out what we're doing.
Taliesin: We're going to die here.
Ashley: Okay, I'll run to-- sorry, I'm stuttering. Keyleth's doing it?
Taliesin: As long as we're all touching, it doesn't matter where Keyleth is, but Turn Undead would help, maybe?
Laura: Or heal us.
Taliesin: Healing or Turn Undead.
Ashley: When's your turn up?
Taliesin: I'm coming up, right?
Laura: And you're holding your action, Keyleth?
Matt: Yes, after Pike's turn.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to do Mass Cure Wounds at 6th level. Let's see.
Taliesin: I'm going to use the ring of counting. This is actually proving to be invaluable.
Marisha: It's very handy.
Laura: What? What did you just think of?
Travis: Nothing.
Taliesin: Later. We need a bigger boat.
Ashley: Fuck, this is a bad roll.
Sam: Is this a new round since my last Counterspell?
Matt: What was the last one you countered and failed? That was on Vecna's turn, so when it comes back to your turn, it will be.
Taliesin: Not yet.
Ashley: 26 points. I rolled so badly.
Laura: 26 is great.
Ashley: And then... am I able to also, at this point, see if I can channel divinity?
Matt: It's an action to do that.
Ashley: It's not like she's going to show up. Okay. Sorry. I'm so hot.
Sam: That's what I say to myself every morning.
Liam: Your extensions look good, but I feel like that is...
Ashley: Okay. I'm just hanging out.
Matt: Okay. That's Pike's turn.
Marisha: Are we all holding hands? Are we all in position?
Sam: Wait, did you just cure our wounds?
Taliesin: Yeah, we just got 26 points back.
Ashley: Wait. Can I do a Mass Healing Word as my bonus action?
Matt: What level? No, because you already did a higher-level. You can't do that, unfortunately.
Sam: You can do it to one person.
Ashley: I'll do one person. Who's closest to me?
Taliesin: She's probably at the bottom.
Ashley: Where are you at? Oh yeah, you're nothing. Let me do the Healing Word.
Laura: You're nothing! You're nobody!
Travis: You'll never mean nothing in this world!
Matt: At the end of your turn, Pike, Vecna's going to go ahead and cast-- you hear the voice enter your mind once more, Pike. "Don't worry. If you love her that much, I'll send her to you." Make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Oh no, dexterity.
Matt: Let me see if it's dexterity or constitution. Let me check real fast.
Laura: What's he doing?
Sam: He's trying to hurt our Pikey.
Matt: That is a dexterity. Make a dexterity saving throw.
Ashley: 16.
Taliesin: Nope.
Ashley: I knew it was too low.
Matt: All right. You take 78 points of force damage.
Ashley: How much?
Matt: 78.
Ashley: 78. Okay. That is okay. I'm unconscious--
Matt: However, if it brings you to zero, it turns you to dust.
Laura: But her armor!
Matt: But the armor.
Travis: Oh!
Sam: It never got her to zero.
Matt: As soon as you hit zero, the armor flickers in, and the divine--
Marisha: Oh my god.
Taliesin: Which also means that all the fucking skeletons take damage!
Matt: Yep. As the ray hits you and you feel your flesh begin to dissipate, the blessing of Pelor and the guidance of Sarenrae flicker into you, and you watch as light and flames (explosion noise) burst out of her like a Doctor regenerating. As the fire consumes the area, roll your damage for your armor. Thank you for reminding me of that.
Travis: Plate of the Dawnmartyr, you guys.
Taliesin: I was about to say, I know the stats of the Dawnmartyr really well right now, for reasons.
Travis: They take 6d6 fire damage.
Laura: 6d6 fire damage!
Travis: The ones within melee.
Matt: To all hostile creatures, correct?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: Not all creatures?
Laura: All hostile.
Matt: That's a very important distinction.
Laura: That was terrible!
Ashley: 14. You know what? It's fine. I'm alive.
Matt: Okay, so as the flames burn out, you watch as the skeletons that catch flame, their bone burning to black, but they're still standing. Okay. That brings us to Percy.
Ashley: Nothing is going well!
Taliesin: Are we a reasonable chain?
Laura: Yeah, we're just waiting on you to make the touch.
Taliesin: There's nobody breaking the chain? I'm going to move six points in the direction of Delilah because I'm going to bring her with me because I don't want that dead body there. Do I make it in six moves? And while I'm running, just for fucking fun, I'm going to take three shots at that armor, and I'm going to push him the fuck back, if that's okay. I'm going to push that knight back. I'm going to try and do a force push.
Laura: And you're saving your action until we're all touching?
Taliesin: Yeah. It's about to be. We're all touching. Let's get rid of that fucker.
Marisha: We are getting out of here, right?
Taliesin: We're getting the fuck out of here.
Laura: Oh, I thought you were saving your action.
Marisha: I rolled a really fucking shitty initiative.
Taliesin: That's a 27 to hit? The knight.
Matt: That hits, yes.
Taliesin: Okay, and that's a torso push. I'm only going to take the one shot. I don't even care anymore; I'm just pushing him away.
Matt: He's pushed ten feet?
Taliesin: He's pushed ten feet back from my position.
Matt: Does he make a save for that?
Taliesin: There's no save for that, and then he takes a disturbingly sad nine points of damage, plus six points psychic damage. But he's ten feet back. We're all touching. I'm going to save the rest of my attack for anybody who tries to get in the way of this shit. If anybody interrupts us, I've got two more shots ready to go. Also burning a heal for fun, as well.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I will Lightning Bolt at level four the armor knight guy.
Taliesin: I'm also holding onto Delilah.
Sam: He's behind me, so I'll do it from my ass. (laughter)
Liam: I love you so much.
Sam: I'll lift up my leg a little bit. Squeeze it out.
Liam: Like a dog at a fire hydrant.
Sam: It's 8d6, but at level four it's 9d6, I think?
Matt: Level four, it's 9d6, yeah. He did not make his save. He rolled a nine plus six. 15.
Taliesin: Yay! I'm not quite at full.
Matt: He has advantage on his saves against magical effects and spells. He rolled worse.
Sam: 35.
Matt: 35 points of damage. The bolt (lightning noise) through him at the same time he's blasted back by Percy's hit and skids. You see the smoke rise up. Like the Terminator, he keeps moving forward.
Sam: I'll use my movement to gather whatever bits of Vax I can still see.
Taliesin: Put your hands in it.
Sam: And get into "posish."
Taliesin: We're ready to burn.
Sam: I will bonus action Healing Word Pikey-poo, which is for me-- what is Healing Word? It's 2d4 plus six?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ten.
Matt: At the end of Scanlan's turn--
Taliesin: Fuck no!
Travis: Let's just have a conversation about this. We're adults.
Laura: What is this game, Matthew? Don't do it!
Matt: He is going to take a shot at Pike with a Firebolt cantrip.
Taliesin: You have a reaction.
Sam: I do, but I want to save it.
Ashley: Bob and weave. I can bob and weave.
Taliesin: There's no save. This is it.
Sam: Do people have to be alive to get out of here?
Matt: That is a 21. What's your armor class?
Ashley: 23.
Travis: It doesn't even hit!
Liam: Eat a dick!
Ashley: Eat a bag of dicks!
Travis: At level five?
Matt: I rolled a five. It's a cantrip. It fires the bolt towards you; you're barely holding on. As you turn around, the flame hits you, but your armor absorbs it. No impact. Okay.
Laura: I need Taco Bell right now in my life!
Ashley: I know. I want Taco Bell so bad. We might have cheats tonight.
Matt: That's the end of Scanlan's turn. Keyleth?
Marisha: Are we all here?
Taliesin: We're all here.
Marisha: We're all sure about this? We're out? 100%?
Taliesin: We're dying.
Travis: No, let's stay and fight.
Marisha: We're on this plane, right?
Travis: Yeah, we're on the material plane.
Marisha: Then we're going to the Feywild! And we all hold hands--
Matt: Are you turning back to your form, then?
Marisha: Yes, I drop form and I pull out my tuning fork and my flowers, and I think deep about the Gilded Run and the Shademirk Bog and the beautiful pond that we appeared around, that we know there's a portal right near it. That's what I think about strongly, and I say, everyone think about the pretty ponds!
Liam: Feywild Spring Break, motherfuckers!
Marisha: Spring Break 2017, Feywild!
Taliesin: Roll. You're a good man.
Matt: Vecna's going to attempt to Counterspell.
Sam: Yep. 7th-level Counterspell against him. (laughter)
Travis: I knew that's what you were waiting for!
Matt: That was some old-school Magic  The Gathering shit, right there.
Liam: Do it, Scanlan. Do it.
Ashley: You just pulled out the wild Uno card. (laughter)
Taliesin: We're not happy yet.
Matt: So 7th-level Counterspell. Yeah, you don't have to roll. (cheering)
Matt: Yeah. Let me check real fast. I need to confirm this real fast.
Laura: Scanlan's back.
Liam: Shorthalt's back.
Travis: "I'd rather not use it."
Matt: Yeah, no. The only spell he even had left to Counterspell was 7th level. Yeah, (poof).
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: As the glyph of shattering begins to coalesce around his fingers in one hand and the wrist on the other, you strike up a Counterspell of your own.
Sam: Sure. I will say to him, this time-- I've got nothing left. I will sing to him, (singing) I'm beautiful. I'm beautiful, it's true. You saw my face in a crowded place, and you didn't know what to do because I just took a shit on you.
Ashley: Oh my god.
Matt: The last thing you hear as the spell begins to take effect is the whispered voice of Vecna throughout all of your heads say, "What?" (laughter)
Matt: Before (spell noise) you are all yanked through a familiar tunnel of darkness and then thrust out into the center of a clustered, dense forest in the Feywild.
Sam: Oh god. Have I been there? Wait, was that me? Yes. Okay.
Marisha: I'm sorry. I would have taken us home, but we were already there, and I had to go somewhere else.
Laura: Where's Vax?
Matt: And that's where we're going to end. (groaning)
Liam: (fake crying) You sadistic motherfucker! You cut it right there?! I was okay until right then!
Taliesin: That's not nice.
Matt: I'm so sorry.
Taliesin: Nothing feels good.
Liam: I was okay until right then!
Ashley: Let's do one more hour.
Travis: That was amazing. That was brutal. We didn't have a fucking chance.
Taliesin: No, there was not a fucking prayer.
Liam: What else were we going to do? Set up an Orange Julius stand by that tower? Of course we were going to go into that tower.
Travis: Of course! But we didn't know how fucked we were until we got up there. We had to go.
Marisha: I thought that we were pretty badass when we took the tower down, and we were not.
Ashley: No.
Marisha: I can get you back, man. I can get you fucking back!
Sam: Can you? Without a body?
Matt: We're going to have some discussions.
Sam: Without a body?
Marisha: But True Resurrection says I can.
Matt: Marisha. We'll have some discussions. Anyway. Thank you guys so much for watching. Thanks for kicking in for a taste of the final arc. Holy shit.
Taliesin: You know what, I'm grateful that we're not--
Matt: Oh man. There was part of me, where either they were going to end up waiting-- if that didn't break concentration, they were either going to wait for you and probably lose a lot more, possibly Keyleth once she realized what was going on. Or left without you. You would have come back.
Laura: And we would have been gone.
Travis: And I would have to have won the game all by myself.
Sam: Which you've already done.
Travis: Or I would have taken the Deck and been like--
Liam: Number one lesson. The one takeaway tonight. The one takeaway is just how OP Vax'ildan is. (laughter)
Matt: This is true.
Laura: If he can't move, he's fucked.
Travis: Boots no longer.
Marisha: I can't believe I fucking dumped my 9th-level spell in you, and then you got tied down. It made zero fucking difference.
Liam: You did great.
Marisha: We both wasted our fucking 9th-level spells.
Sam: They're hard to use. We've got to learn to use them better.
Liam: You've got one chance to do something fucking amazing.
Laura: Vecna is out and ready to fucking destroy.
Matt: We'll pick up on this next week.
Sam: Wow. I'm shaking.
Matt: Me, too. All right, guys. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful night. We'll see you soon, and is it Thursday yet?
Travis: Nope! It's Thursday right now!
Liam: Last Thursday.
Matt: Good night, guys. [music]
